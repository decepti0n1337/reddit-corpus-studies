I dont identify with any group
---
---
---
Have been after this for a year looking on looking for group. NA doesn’t have any guilds I know that still run it. I wish they would adjust the metas due to less players being in them. 
---
I will try to be on more to check on this though because I have been seeing a few more people posting about it lately. Had given up hope though until recently.
---
People are either:
---
A) ignoring it after the toy egg incident
---
B) Not living in the US
---
Some good stuff, but I'm afraid dexters mum doesn't have enough junk in the trunk, sorry 0/10 &lt;3
---
Awesome - been on the fence about buying the game / expansion after trying it out and now I got it for free! :D
---
Such look, much wow
---
I got other games to play and spend money on
---
still valid Friday 8:01 PM EST

I played off and on during LS1, I remember playing mostly during the Dragon Bash and the Bazaar, and then took a hiatus. One of if not the only LS mission I played was the death of Captain Theo Ashford, and I remember being intimidated by the mission being level 80, and my character being in the 30s-40s at best, even if I got scaled up. I don't think I even finished it.
---
Now that I've really gotten into the game, I'm kicking myself for missing out on so much that I was otherwise present for. Although I at least got to see LA during Dragon Bash, which was awesome. Not only was it old LA, which was inherently awesomr, but there were fireworks everywhere and a FREAKING HOLOGRAPHIC DRAGON FLYING AROUND. It was probably the coolest thing I'd ever seen.
---
i bet nobody EVER used a random mail and fake personal information for a "giveaway"
---
Hey, no need to be condescending about it.
---
You could read further, I guess.
---
Yay US only....

Just got one for a family member, so it’s still going.

Save $30 ($15 on sale)

love these frequent updates

I mean, Alienware has a ton of followers. Guess most people don't even jump at the idea of Guild Wars 2. Either that, or there are more than 4,000 keys available.
---
HURRY AND GET THE FREE EXPANSION FROM ALIEN
---
Well, their aim is to get as many people giving legit info as possible. They're also hoping they become Alienware/Dell customers, or long-time users of the AWA platform
---
Use a VPN.
---
The only way to get a code is to make another new account.
---
Um this bothers me a lot. The music he made for the game, made the game special and is a part of it being successful. So many other games never understood that good music makes all the difference. I understand he is not quitting straight off, but still it sounds like we will loose a lot of music and sound to the game and yeah that really bothers me.
---
Got one for my cousin who's in a timezone that is still asleep - thank you!
---
Omg your bun is such a cute floof! I love her! She looks a lot like mine. He's a lionhead mix so he has a similar hairdo. lol

Damn it, JK!

Like in custom arenas (hot join), they also reward less and cap out at 10k.
---
Whoops I missed a zero and put “20,00” instead of  “20,000” good catch. Notice that the 1069 more games is only to hit 80 from 17, the additional 400 is for 80-100
---
It's funny I already have an account but nothing listed under account &gt; giveaways and I'm in the US  LOL
---
No, you can get it on your existing account.  Click on the guild wars 2 from the main screen of https://na.alienwarearena.com/.  The click on the Path of Fire tile and do the quest again.  You will then get a code.
---
Hmm, just saw it's US only tough, dunno if Brasil is included lol.
---
So kids are gambling with their parents credit card without their parents being responsible adults and checking their credit card statements, monitoring what games and websites they are using and in general not doing their job as parents. So the government needs to step in and parent for everyone including those without children?
---
This isnt an issue with gambling it is an issue of responsibility. Responsible parents, responsible children and responsible adults.
---
Everyone who keeps saying that the videogame companies are preying on the consumer, completely ignore the fact that you do not have to buy any of these lootboxes or the game at all. You have a responsibility to yourself to make thay decision. The decision is do you want to spend money on a cosmetic item that does not affect your ability to play the game?
---
If you spent the money then, that is your choice and ANet should not be punished because you wanted to spend money on something you did not need, but wanted.
---
I do wish they would give us more options in terms of non-buttcapes. The elegy chest is the best looking one that I currently have for my medium armor asura.
---
Thanks! I do have some experience boosters lying around.
---
I see I see. Thanks. That sure is a lot of games, though.
---
Well they only have 4000 keys to giveaway.. whether someone gets all 4000, or its split.. I don't think they care.. as long as all of them get used up.
---
Freelance anything is better for whatever you do. You're not locked to one contract and you can actually expand and do anything you want.

If you buy the Complete Edition while already owning Prophecies, you'll get four codes.  You won't need the Prophecies code, and can apply the other three to your account that has Prophecies (and then connect it to GW2 if you haven't yet).
---
Feel free to gift your extra Prophecies code to a friend to encourage them to play with you!
---
I got a code for my friend, but she says it didn't work though. Don't tell me it's just for US accounts because that'd be stupid
---
I’m sorry man it is only for US I wish I had clarified. And yes it is very stupid
---
No, that just means you got lucky. That reward is not part of the "first 4,000 people to signup for this link" thing. You can spin that wheel daily. Some people get a Path of Fire code, but I've only gotten ARP every time. The first X people to spin the wheel were guaranteed $25 Dell US credit, though.
---
Exactly, it honestly provides enough info as it is.
---
Let's be real, OP *never* would have made this post if they didn't fuck up.
---
No one said it didn't. The post you're responding to said nothing about ranking those classes.
---
[removed]
---
Tempest is probably one of the strongest classes in pugs when you don't have a support. It is stronger than weaver in these cases, also brings some ranged DPS, not as much CC but also much easier and reliable access to CC without screwing your rotation most of the time. (Earth overload is the RIP). Also brings very nice burst if done correctly.    
---
Reapers and DH are generally the highest DPS in a party where you have 0 supports what so ever. Despite reaper getting 25 might and quickness themselves. Tempest can rival this if you know what you are doing.
---
Oh, finnaly got it can't believe it man.
---
Aso it was like 10 minutes ago, just used the built in Opera VPN and i was good to go, so there's still some keys left in there if anybody want them.
---
Mini-dungeons do not require a group to complete... but Forsaken Halls happens to be one of the few that can be a little challenging to solo, especially if it's your first time and you're learning the mechanics of it. There's also a champion at the end who can be challenging depending on your class.
---
Don't worry, most mini-dungeons aren't like that at all. In fact, most of the time you don't even know you're in one until you find a chest or get an achievement or see it pop up as a daily.
---
Will have to check if they fixes the bug/exploit on elementalist.
---
Sent an e-mail 2 days ago and no answer yet
---
120 for me hehe, very nice.
---
Tempest for pugs IMO. Weaver for when you have buffs is my general rule. Weaver with buffs on T4 CMs etc outclass tempest by a fair bit.
---
Wish there was a giveawat for upgrading HoT to deluxe version
---
So is it HoT or just the core game?
---
Should be doable on Medium. I played on worse for years.
---
You're going to wait to turn Character Model limit to Lowest or Low, and you're going to want to turn down Shadows. Everything else should be good on Medium or perhaps high for the less intensive stuff. You'll have to fiddle with it.
---
You're probably going to drop into the 20s with large groups of 30+ people, and in the major hub city (Pro tip: Use the Asura starter city instead).  As well, the first map of Path of Fire and the second map of Heart of Thorns are pretty notorious for being punishing on Low end rigs.
---
&gt;(P.S. Arenanet if you're looking to fill any audio positions... make my dreams come true haha!)
---
Maybe while /u/maclaine is still in the thread, you can make that connection, ha ha.
---
Glad they fixed the EC bug but does anyone else hate the new map? It went from feeling too open to feeling claustrophobic.
---
黑水
---
Noooooo it's going to take aaaages
---
It’s actually PoF Alienware just for some reason thinks it’s the first expansion
---
Yeah, it's weird I get insta perma ban for a reason I'm actually not related to. I'm sure I haven't banned even once since 2012. I'll try to send another ticket. Thanks you.
---
Its still in progress  im a big shoulder guy and like pink/purple so a pink tank what is im going for
---
Damn, HoT would have been better but I'll take the free expacs for last/friends
---
Well glad it worked out for you, hopefully the next promos will be less region specific lol.
---
Asura look the best to me, both genders.
---
As for worst, I really hate Charr female models and Human male models.
---
*hangs around in subs of games he doesn't care about to trashtalk them*
---
Underwater expansions would give me an unnececarry amount of cancer.
---
Thanks for letting us know.
---
Hey, im from europe but for some reason it doesnt work if i use tunnelbear, got any tips how to solve it?
---
If not i guess im just unlucky and i wish everyone fun with the game :)
---
Thank you for what you do. I'm glad it's not a forever thing :).
---
Damn, what a waste of the double EXP.
---
Yeah, I don't think ArenaNet actually researched the flow of funds of my account. In fact, it haven't changed largely. I guess those few suspicious people just reported me billion times.
---
only if built for flanking; a decent open world SB build would rely more on dagger#2, torch#5, viper nest and flame trap
---
Perhaps it’s your ISP. My suggestion is get a VPN that you trust. My ping was over 800 when playing in China when connected to NA servers, but a PVN got it down to 320.
---
I didn't demand a nerf, I am saying that PVP in this game is very complex compared to many other popular PVP-based games.
---
I wanted to get the [mistforged glorious hero's plate helm](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistforged_Glorious_Hero%27s_armor) for a style I'd like to have for one of my chartacters. 
---
I looked it up and saw that the ascended shards of glory aren't *too* time consuming or difficult to get, but that rank 100 thing would take a lot of time to get to.
---
Both [EVA] and [LEET] run VB, although the former does it earlier and more often. I personally help [LEET] command VB occasionally but it depends on interest. 
---
In the mornings on NA is when both guilds run their HoT meta. Roughly around 11am EST on weekdays I believe is when [EVA] runs theirs. [LEET] would run the meta following that, if we decide to do so.
---
There are a lot of skills and traits in the game named after old GW1 skills.
---
Thank you for your service to Tyria and our ears. It is truly splendid to listen to pieces you craft for the world and Tyria will be lesser for your absence.
---
More than you.
---
&gt; Yeah, I don't think ArenaNet actually researched the flow of funds of my account.
---
so you legit think anet is banning you because they received some amount of reports against your account in a small time frame and thought to themselves this must be 100% accurate and then perma banned you based on the reports alone?
---
Your music has captivated me time and again. Every once in a while, I just have to stop what I'm doing ingame and just... listen. Thank you for everything - you're amazing! (also I was terrified when I read the title; glad to know you're still going to be with us.)

fuck NSP again :(
---
Trust me, five kids and a full time job an hour away from home do seriously limit my ingame time enough also

I just bought this game and gave up a weeks worth of lunch for this...
---
Heavy Bounty Hunter's armor.
---
You get it by saving trade contracts from PoF bounties and buying from Priory Historian Elisa, a wandering NPC. Her stock rotates every day.
---
Advice to new players taking advantage of this giveaway: disable double-tap to evade. It will save you lots of frustrations.
---
Plenty of end game in this game, just not TRADITIONAL end game.
---
Do you know in Lotro, a dev once said that less than 10% of the population EVER raided or PvPed. That's huge. What's traditional in MMOs may very well be what keeps MMOs a niche market year after year.
---
The fact is that dungeons exist because people still play them. Saying they may as well not exist is a ridiculous statement. They don't exist for someone who doesn't enjoy them. They exist for people who do.
---
There are raids in this game, but most people don't raid.
---
To be sure if you're looking for a game focused on instanced end game content, this is a bad choice, but that's not what you're saying.
---
WvW is a form of PvP, so this game has two viable PvP modes
---
I never said the game was perfect. Even in my first response to you I said blowouts in PvP happen more often than they should. But you used a specific figure 99%. That was a blatant exaageration.   Admit  it, you don't like the game and that's fine. 
---
You're still overstating your case by a big margin.
---
Pretty sure that they have said in the past that “just reports” of something will never get a player banned automatically because they have someone look into all of the reports.
---
Sadly I have no quite for it, but it might have been from Dornsinger or one of the other reddit-active CS devs.
---
I'd say every second gm is clueless or I just have bad luck. Once wrote a ticket in german and got a unreadable response back. Reworte the ticket in english just in hope they would understand then. This however got me an even worse broken english answer.
---
Then asked support about a problem that happend to me by accident a few years back and they were like no it's too long gone. When I asked them why an item associated to a achievement which I accidently deleted needs to have happend recently they were just like "oh no there are several reasons." When I asked to clarify those reasons they just shut me up and closed the ticket. Like not really a nice support honestly.
---
It doesn't exist.
---
&gt;A studio having a full time composer or multiple composers is a luxury that is very rare throughout the game industry. There are probably less than a dozen studios worldwide in that situation.
---
It saddens me to hear that. Music is such an incredibly powerful tool, and many games these days would benefit from giving more consideration to their score and how it both interacts with and drives a game/narrative. 
---
Mike Morasky did some absolutely wonderful work layering the soundtrack and gameplay in Portal 2, and it is easily one of my favourite games of all time *because* of the soundtrack and it's interactivity. Similarly, the music in GW2 is easily the best part of the game by far in my opinion, and gives the story a real sense of "*oomph*".
---
I certainly hope we'll continue to see your work in GW2, and will be very interested in your other projects going forwards.
---
The new mode they're referring to when you equip druid is Celestial Avatar. New as in not on core ranger, not new thing to the game. Supposedly they're going to have the elite specs have a trade off. The trade off druid gets for CA is lower pet stats.
---
Depends. If you roam, which is what most SBs are "meant to do" you:
---
* Use that smokefield (smokescale) for stealth
---
* Get boon uptime higher if you have trait that gives pets boons to you
---
* Or use it as stunbreak if you use that trait
---
* probably, maybe, sometimes you use smokescale to keep enemy in combat.
---
Otherwise? Meh
---
RMT by anet's definition is not strictly sending gold in exchange for money. It could also be selling/trading/sharing account. If two people can prove ownership of said account, and anet can't decide which one is the actual owner, the account will be terminated with RMT clause, no "first offense" temp ban either, just straight terminated account. This isn't as easy as simple email hack and you got your account terminated, not at all, but shit happens.
---
If you're still reading, please don't be stupid, activate 2FA and use different password for your account and email. Don't be that guy who keep saying "i am okay without 2FA" on every single account hack thread i've ever read here, and then cry wolf when anet ban your account or you lost access permanently.
---
its not “bad” but reddit is not a place for it. Go to devianart for this, don’t clutter a place for discussion with ‘your’ shitty character pictures.
---
Im considering that as an option but I think she likes the idea of us getting waypoints together and vista's etc. I really am into the idea of the engineer but I'm terrified of having to remember long rotations, while understanding the other core concepts of the game also. Thank you for your response!
---
That's insane, I have one question if you know. It's engineer as intimidating as I have been reading? I'm thoroughly enjoying it now, and I am in love with the elite specs, and how different they are from each other, but I really want to understand the traditional concepts of the class before I consider elite specs. Would this be something I will learn from leveling to 80?
---
" Expires July 31, 2019 " ???  wont be able to apply code after this date I think? to stop ppl from selling it? cant be them disable the pof after activated it?
---
I'd say satire, an exaggeration of a negative aspect of something putting it in a bad light. Jokes are funny when they cut on the edge of reality, and I don't think this is funny... but that is because I don't think there is much bad art here. On the other hand, I guess if you truly believe that...
---
Well, in any case, my opinion, the  only satire here, is this subreddit, and how does this get so many up-votes?
---
Either that or there is some sorta Meta humor I am no 'in' on.
---
&gt;GAME
---
Haha you lost it. And so did I...
---
What was first version of HoT which MO didn't fix yet? Scoops of butter?
---
Silverwastes is totally doable with mounts, especially since you're usually running the rotation at your own pace anyways.
---
Thanks for the reply. It's not a tradeoff. Celestial Avatar is not new, hasn't been new...it's the last expansions elite. Why did it need the pets nerfed--stick to that and ignore the rest of my post.
---
You have to understand, Druid has been getting repeated nerfs when it was very strong, when it was still meta, when it was no where near meta (PvP speaking) and the hits just keep coming on in. One very skilled player makes it work in top 100 PvP. One.
---
This isn't something people are complaining about.
---
This is Gw2 Devs beating a dead horse.
---
It's my contention someone threw this in at the last second to act like they did something.
---
Why would a Druid need a tradeoff?
---
If you don't mind spending the gold or cash for a character slot and you want another character there is no harm in just making one even if you don't end up playing it much later.  Gw2 is really alt friendly and also rewards you for having many characters through birthday gifts and [alt parking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqS26EBQXJ4).
---
Waiting for a dev to actually give me some idea why they keep beating this dead horse.
---
Holy shit! Thank you man for this post. I just got the code, but I live in europe and used a vpn bult in Opera so I hope I won't get banned :D. I'm poor so I couldn't afford it. Thanks again.
---
Typo :(
---
not even chan wants to be associated with you
---
It went from one of my favourite maps to instant dislike.  It's far too crowded now.  Yes, it was too open before in some places and something probably needed to be done, but this was a stupid over-reaction.
---
better spend your time and money on an education
---
I have a lot of world completions that were done before mounts or gliding, 2 after gliding and 4 done after mounts were added to the game.
---
I agree that the exploration was great the first couple of times around but seeing the same spots over and over again gets stale, not to mention having to do the Renown Hearts over and over lol.
---
Nah I meant, I can actually name them all. I've spent way too much time fashion warsing lol.
---
You got some interesting colour going on there.
---
Thank you!
---
&gt; Devs, I know you can't chat openly on the forums, can you answer here?
---
How do you know?
---
A single person can guard a non-primary camp. Just kill all the Mordrem except for a healer (or some other small baddie). Then just kite until the timer runs out. You might need to start off with 2-3, but a single person can definitely maintain it.
---
I never shared/sold/traded my account. I use 2FA as well. I literally did nothing related to RMT and what you mentioned above.
---
wat
---
If you believe you were the subject of a personal attack via reporting, you should've mentioned that in your ticket. At least, judging from what you wrote, lead me to believe that you didn't. Idk how much I believe this regardless though because these posts are usually kinda shady and it's impossible to verify you're telling the truth, but if anything mention what I said in the first sentence and they will hopefully look into the matter. Make sure to give names too if you have them, it would be hard to investigate if even you don't know exactly who you're talking about.
---
No, I didn't. I was playing the game as usual, and suddenly got perma banned QQ
---
If you have a guild or can find a group with at least five persons including yourself and the others are willing to WvW for you you can be marked to get shared credit for participation. That way you can stay in safe areas and still progress your Gift of Battle.
---
Otherwise dailies are the way to go, or Dolyak escorts if you can do so in well defended areas (which seems to be the main issue).
---
You may try and switch to a 'good' server but it will be quite expensive and quite random too.
---
PvP Daily Rooms you can grind, but have to follow the rules of the room. Pretty much, you trade kills/wins with people in a friendly environment.
---
Unfortunately you cannot grind it all out in one go. It caps you off at how much reward track experience you can gain in a day from custom games like that. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% of the reward track, so it would take you like 4 days. That is also including the PvP reward track potions that you will be consuming for doing the dailies every day.
---
Does sPvP include the Gift of Battle reward track? If so the wiki is in need of an update.
---
I got 2x gifts just by doing the easy dailies (veteran slayer, spender, occasionally camp capture). Sure it takes a while, but requires zero pvp aspect.
---
Keruli_ was mostly referring to "he will dearly be missed in Tyria", since his Tweets specifically says he'll continue to provide music for GW2.
---
didnt work for me , anyone can spare me 1 key?
---
There isn’t a way around it if that’s what your asking. Right now there’s a bonus event so I would suggest trying to join an squad/tag and go with it if you want it done semi quickly or you could just do dailys until you finish it. On the bright side you used to have to do map compeltion on all the wvw maps so at least you dont have to do that.
---
Rather than answer your questions as numbered questions, probably better to provide a bit of history.
---
The original plan was to have no expansions at all and just continue the game with free updates called living world.
---
Season 1 of the Living World was something I hadn't seen before. It was sort of a real time changing of the world. Chapters came out about every 2 weeks at some points, or a month at others and they furthered a story. If you weren't there for that content, it was gone at the end, and there's be something else new. The idea was that whenever you logged in something else would be going on.
---
Great for people like me who played every day and has all the time in the world, but not so great for new and returning players or people who have less time over all. For some people it felt like a lot of pressure to get stuff done. Many will tell you it was the most exciting time for the game, but of course, there were times when it was quite hectic and other times when the quality of a release wasn't all there due to the crazy schedule.
---
Season 2 changed all that in that it was repeatable. Like all living world chapters, you get it free if you log in while it's live, but you have to pay for it if you miss the release window, usually 2-3 months. Log in and you unlock it free forever. Again, the plan was till not to have an expansion, which answers your question about why there haven't been more expansions. It wasn't the goal of the company to offer content that way and, in my opinion, it was player demand that drove the first expansion to be released. But it came out 3.5 years after the game released.
---
The real thing is, if you keep logging in you'll get future chapters of the living world free, but you have to buy the other ones. Other releases of content occur with Living World patches, so you might get a new fractal or a new raid. Sometimes minor content patches is released between living world updates as well. The content delivery structure for this game is unique in my experience. It's just done weirdly, but the company isn't depending on expansions to further stuff like story. 
---
The game is doing well. Most games have layoffs long before this one does. TSW laid off half their staff about a year after it launched and SWTOR laid off about a third. However, we were told most of the people laid off weren't working on Guild Wars 2 at all, they were working on other projects, at least a couple of which have been canceled, so some people are gone, but some people have come back to working on Guild Wars 2. 
---
This game is still going strong. There are still years left to it. With the next Living Story release we're getting a new mount and presumably a new legendary greatsword to work on.  
---
If you're new, you have tons of content to keep you going for a very long time anyway. Only people like me, who have played for thousands of hours feel that we want content to come out faster.
---
wow. i wish i knew this sooner
---
Repair walls.
---
Ask anet.
---
You think it's good to let people circumvent daily limits by having multiple accounts?
---
It erases and semblance of an economy.
---
I'd have them do away with direct trades altogether if they'd go for it.
---
Anyone has a spare key? Im not from US so I could not get one :(
---
Most of what you consider to be great music was completed by Jeremy Soule (of Elder Scrolls fame), not this dude. Music has sucked for a long time.
---
Are yu guys under level 80 and not wearing Exotics/Ascended? 
---
Could explain why yu guys are melting.
---
Thank you. Your music is such an important part of playing GW2, it really adds to the sense of wonder of exploring Tyria.
---
There is no escape for Dzagonur from us.
---
Couldnt get one, Im not from US ... yes, i tried with VPN ... if someone has a spare key, much appreciated :D
---
With how often I use the brilliant 'Deposit All Materials' feature, I'd like to have a separate button for it instead of it being stashed inside the little gear menu. There'd be plenty of room for a 'Deposit' button as well as a 'Compact' button next to the gear icon, or at the bottom of the inventory screen next to the wallet button.
---
Additionally, I'd appreciate a [bigger preview window](https://i.imgur.com/9BxNSIH.png) for equipment and outfits, which would especially benefit Charr and Norn characters.
---
Lastly, an option to disable the game changing my zoom level at certain encounters would help with keeping an overview of the fight instead of having to fight the zoom setting.
---
I did the Entanglement episode of the Living Story and aiming to get the No Tricks achievements by killing all the Inquest without using the machinery. I did that but got no achievements at the end, even though i never use any of Scarlet machine. Is it bugged, or did i miss something?
---
yeah but While Hawkeye's daughter and Professor Hulk actually set up Old Man Logan, the franchise will move forward with setting up a movie about the Celestials and Eternals in Avengers Endgame lol
---
It’s so weird scrolling through Reddit then spotting your firebrand main in the meme template you made. lol
---
Hoping they bring Soule back for the next expansion after this news.
---
this is pretty scary question tbh, why does everytime i hear about official giveaway(kungfu tea and alienware) always related to a ban ?
---
US Only!?!?
---
Fuck you Anet/Alienware.
---
They obviously cant ban you from participating in the promotion via VPN but these 4k keys were only meant to be distributed in the US, so once you apply them to an account outside the US, they know that you broke the competition rules.
---
If OP done anything to you, that would be so, as i did nothing to you.
---
Just to edit.  For your option 1,  you say weekend event, it's an all week event.
---
Or ley line converter.
---
I listen to the games music while Im doing my work or need to meditate.
---
Thank you for being a huge part of my day to day life - i hope you continue to compose like you have for many years to come
---
It’s not bugged, when you use UA and your target moves out of range the skill fails, as it should do. You still get the evade frames though so this is actually a win/win situation as you can cast other skills while evading, which you usually couldn’t do.
---
Further you suggested things someone else would have to do, i do not see a solution, players could use. but i guess its just a way you put words together that confused me. Yes, i did read further, even on the first go. I was not expecting an addon, but at least a method for self controlling the infusion problem.
---
Iirc correctly you also need to trigger allt he ambush/trap zones that reveal hidden patrols so you might wanna make sure you got detected every time it was possible. There may also be a trick with a specific group of inquest that you need to get to fast.
---
If you plan on trying it again pay attention to your buff bar: if you lose the buff without getting the achieve or while some inquest are still very much alive then something counted as "used machinery" and if you don't lose the buff on your bar until the end of the section it's because you mised a few Inquests.
---
You enjoy your rework. Im gonna go to a dive bar next to a sketchy taco bell with my thief buddies and cry.
---
Season 4, as ham
---
Season 3, as tomato
---
Season 2, as pickle 
---
Season 1, as black caviar 
---
No salad, salad died when we used butter
---
they just check from where you log in to get your physical location
---
No kind soul would have a spare key at all would they? I’ve recently got this game and I’m just past level 10 and loving it, the full account benefits would be awesome. Sucks that this was U.S only, ah well
---
it's hidden
---
whats hidden?
---
Thank you for making this whole thing even more magical than it already was
---
My comment is malicious and I never claimed otherwise, what are you on about? Nice wall of text but your just rambling at this point. "But it's practice!" Yh I know how it goes I am an artist, doesn't make them immune from criticism and not every forum is their own personal blog. You can complain all you want but the fact that those posts get barely any upvotes and often downvotes, I'm not the only one here who doesn't appreciate low effort fanart fishing for compliments, and if they were TRULY a practicing artist they'd actually improve somewhat and listen to criticism (which they always deflect and never do). So until those "artists" own up you won't be seeing anybody here own up specifically because of people like you swooping in to "defend their honor" even if there's literally nobody to defend like in this situation. 
---
Your the one who needs to think things through and use your brain when you read, things aren't as obvious as they seem.
---
Okay
---
Mendons problems require mendons solutions.
---
FTFY
---
Please **REMOVE GIFT OF EXPLORATION FROM PVE**, I cannot bother to do it outside WvW.
---
Seriously... Buy legendary on TP if you could not do WvW.
---
&gt;It erases any semblance of an economy.
---
**And yet it hasn't.** GW2 has allowed multiboxing for nearly seven years, and we still have a functioning, realistic economy.
---
No fix on Guard Mace 3? Or is it working as intended and the tooltips just misleading
---
People said the same about mounts and anet made those fun. Granted, it’s always a hit and miss with anet but this blatant hate for anything underwater related is baffling to me.
---
If you want to give it a try play revenant trident. It’s underwater combat but with their 2018 approach and polish.
---
I guess it was US only?
---
swing that credit card and buy it from tp
---
Full zerker Daredevil with staff, using the trait that gives you health when you attack, is a good class to start learning the difficult content. 
---
Autoattacking deals good damage, so you can start focusing and moving and dodging without pressing any key while you autoattack, and you heal at the same time. 
---
When you feel confortable, you can start using the second skill every 3 autoattacks. When you feel confortable, you can start using the other skills when needed.
---
People just don't like being underwater, especially not fighting there. They already gave us a rework so that water feels more like air and not like actual water. People still kind of want nothing to do with it. 
---
I don't think Anet can change that anymore, nor that they will try to. "underwater shucksh" is a very persistent sentiment.
---
It's great that they added new kite spots and objects, but maybe 2/3 of what was added would've been sufficient?
---
All german servers feel pretty active when playing vs them, especially during holiday.
---
Nice work! You might enjoy the Alchemy weapon set.
---
Now all that's missing is some quality ham
---
if you alt+f4 when people shout meta event in map chat, you get a free mount
---
I like that they added new objects, but too much is too much. Maybe 2/3 of what was added would've been sufficient.
---
Sorry, my english is failung me now, do you mean close-ups or just which faces that were used?
---
you put butter on your cheese sandwich? HERESY!
---
Guess I have to wait for next Halloween, damn. Thank you for the infos :)
---
Anytime!
---
&gt; as well as a 'Compact' button next to the gear icon
---
If so, please make that an option. It would be too easy to hit it by accident, messing up my inv completely.
---
I'm gonna start addressing all Asura as Mouse Child from now on, heck i want a tittle Mouse Child!
---
Can you be more specific? 
---
"Zeros in gear" is a confusing description (are some stats reading zero? Which ones? Is it on gear descriptions or is it in the hero panel? Is this on level 80s? What gear are they running? etc.)
---
Also, what do you mean when you say "insane damage"? What numbers are you seeing? Thousands per hit? Millions? NaN? Negative overflows? What do you see in the combat log? Are there certain skills hitting for disproportionately more than they should be?
---
I dont care about spoilers, sometimes I even look them up myself, but I usually watch the episodes when they are leaked or earliest I can so its not gonna happen anyways
---
Blactide + Piken, fml
---
I will get it out of my ass and put it up yours. Deal?
---
Well, that's literally what you guys did to CD last week XD
---
Im a man of few words but i wanted to thank you for the great music you've created and hope to keep hearing more in the future.
---
Even better change compact to "Sort" I hate having to manually drag everything, sort items by category please.
---
Auto deposit would be appreciated too.
---
it doesnt matter on which servers you play, its your physical location. And if you think you are smart and use a VPN, thats also against GW2 EULA. And its no problem for Anet to determine that you are using a VPN either.
---
I wasnt talking about you specifically anyways but players in general, I doubt that everybody is using a VPN.
---
When you press f5 as a chronomancer, you enter continuum split for a few seconds. It’s around 1 second extra for every clone you have. 
---
When CS finishes or you press f5, you come back to where you were, with the life you had, the skills you had on cooldown, etc. 
---
So when you are trying to maximize your dps or support, people try to align CS with all your skills ready, so you enter CS, use all your skills, exit CS, use all your skills again.
---
There’s a huge bug that keeps you locked in Kyhlo
---
For the longest time Druid in PvP had access to amazing defensive skills and traits, all while still doing good (in the past even high) dmg via pets. Anet solved that finally in a very nice way, without having to gut druid even more, and without impacting PvE much.
---
I dont have anything to say about Alienware apart from "it worked fine for me and I used a VPN from EU".
---
But Kungfu tea was a fucking scam and was generally terrible for every part.
---
You could log into Kungfu teas app by using instagram. Guess how many who did that who later got their instagrams hacked/emails saying an attempt was made?
---
Guess who saved all the details you entered to sell it forward?
---
Guess who didn't anticipate the huge amount of people who would want to get stuff from the giveaway, thus crashing their servers from the first hour? (This is gonna happen sure, they esentially ddosed themselves, but the follow up was to add that it was only for US residents, that was never said before their servers crashed then they changed it).
---
Kungfu tea was fucking awful. Alienware is a well known brand in comparison and I doubt any shady shit would be going on with them.
---
Every game key is region specific and only allowed to be applied in the designated countries.
---
i was talking about people, who specifically want the promo, and wish to fake it, there is a solid way to do so.
---
Mounts didn't exist. *Some* people had an issue with the idea of mounts being added at all but I don't think that even close to the majority though. A lot of people were neutral in them. 
---
Underwater sections already exist and are already hated. It's not balanced, you have no weapon variety and half your skills don't work. As it is currently I think it's ok for the odd set piece but certainty not ok for being a large chunk of content. They could overhaul it but it would need a lot of work and carry a significant risk of not working out. Doing this in an expansion IMO would not be the wisest idea. Under water levels in games are generally not well received and have a negative association. People often find them disorientating and it can be awkward fighting enemies that are floating at different elevations. Fear of deep water is also very very common which doesn't help. Even if they fixed all the issues it would be hard to market.
---
Not anymore, as i have less time for gw2 in general. But some XII members do wvw a lot .
---
I don't even want an elite spec, I just want Pet interactions and maybe a few dialogues to refer to the animal being there instead of treating the poor thing just like a prop that happens to have legs and teeth. I mean of you play as a Ranger, half the credit for all your victories probably go to your pet, but does anyone mention the Tiger that bit chunks out of Balthazar? Nope. I am not saying re-record thousands of lines just to make the ranger's pet to be mentioned, but just sometimes let people acknowledge it, like when Rytlock says Mesmers are worse than elementalists and then saying no offense to the elementalist commander. Hell, even in the LW 1 of PoF, rangers use a dry bone to whistle to insects that'll undo their locks rather than say call their pet to get rid of the lock.
---
I agree she did a lot of good music but this is not about her nor is it about Jeremy Soule, but about the fact that just short back there was turbulence on Arena Net. Maclaine moving to be a freelancer free up new choices and this is were my bother comes in. My worry is that they cut down the music which is a big part of GW2. Or it might also fall out on the right side and nothing changes and we still have good music in this game. Which it will be time will tell, but it still worries me until we find out.
---
Your very welcome to beat my time &lt;3, i also explained the reason behind parasitic contagion.
---
It breaks ToS nonetheless, which may result in an account ban.
---
There is nothing in the TOS, neither GW2’s nor Alienware’s, that says that region keys must be used in their region.
---
I like this new character.
---
You do know you can deactivate chat channels?
---
hey tyvm, apreciate it. with regards to cc; i dont personally feel its worth it as the wieght of the defiance bars is too heavy for one person. Not too much or impossible to break; just not worth the time taken to break them.
---
Lena Chapelle was one of the ones let go during the layoffs.
---
Well first of all if there is a map being dominated and there is no one else around dealing with it or the server is simply not interested in dealing with it, then move map. You have 2 other borders and the eb map to go too. 
---
As for the rest, some WvW players hates PvE to a point were they never leave WvW unless they have too. You have to do what they have to do and just accept it and do the best out of it. Fastest way would not be roaming though just saying. Joining a zerg on a meta build and joining Teamspeak/Discord follow the comander will make it way quicker. And especially this week were you have the bonus week with faster rewardtracks. Add the guild hall buff and other buffs you might have around and it goes even faster then that.
---
Gotta say, of all the comics up until now - this one is my favourite. Duke Hunkleberi best character
---
The music got better after Soule left.  HoT has some of the best gaming music I've ever heard.
---
Is there still a code for a long time player who does not own PoF ? You would make my day  !!!
---
It's not much longer than "God Walking Amongst Mere Mortals"
---
and for GW1 standards it's an OK length, just saying ^("My Guild Hall Smells of Rich Mahogany")
---
They only say you can’t send the keys to countries which have trade limited to the US, eg Syria, North Korea, so it’s fine to use a key in EU
---
all depends on the issue, innit
---
really? do you have additional info about this? so i will not be late next time hehe
---
Were you given a choice to step down?
---
So Lena Chapelle's return was more a logical consequence to fill that gap that Maclaine's reduced work time for GW2 is causing. It's great either way. It's always refreshing to hear music from more than one artist so looking forward to this change.
---
Your music is lovely. I'm glad you'll be composing for them in the future, and good luck with this next chapter in your life. &lt;3
---
Response times vary depending on the issue and how much information you are able to provide.
---
This looks like a payment issue after you bought the new expansions. Did you check if your bank ordered a chargeback or did you buy the expacs at an unofficial retailer?
---
Everyone will run circles around you in every sense of the word. But it's a very very solo friendly mmo and exploring the world for the first time is magical.
---
Well, I am not here to change your personal opinion, if you thinks its fine to apply a game key from a US only promotion to your account while located outside the US, I wish you all the best.
---
not a fan of the whole "can't criticize if you never done it" attitude..i wonder if the person that did 3.5h solo VG would say the same
---
you do realize you're the one with supposedly world record because of your made up rules about "never dying but also swapping to war is fine cuz other classes can't solo 2nd boss"
---
Reading that you got banned only days after buying the expansion makes me believe you didn't buy it from a licensed shop or directly from anets website. 
---
They just ban you if you use a stollen key.
---
Wish I had these backpack wings but I hate PvP. Idk how long it takes (the exotic one would be enough)
---
Get full berserker armor dont bother with valk gear.
---
Looks like it was fixed with this update yesterday
---
marauders is far from a happy medium between berserker and valkyrie... yes it gives the same stats as both; but the distribution is all wrong for guardian (specifically; marauders is main PRECISION which means youre going to overcap crit chance from guards multiple crit chance buffs)
---
Anyone got any spare codes by any chance? I think I was too late, all i'm getting now is 50 ARP and a 48h booster for something :(
---
welcome to ascension
---
It only really overlaps if you're running right hand strength and have fury and spotter, so for general content there's nothing wrong with it, a stacked comp with all buffs all the time isn't general use for lfg dungeons or world bosses.
---
berserkers; its more reliable
---
you can get away with some valkyrie thanks to guards crit chance modifiers (10% against burning, which is always up, and 25% from ret... which is harder to obtain reliably) but only if you're already at risk of overcapping (from stuff like spotter or consumables) or are super uncomfortable with full zerker (and even then; id only swap in a valk ammy, not a whole set swap)
---
By very early hours, what do you mean? Like 6AM, or 12? And late hours too.
---
You got me.
---
I had the same issue and sent in a ticket including an shadowplay clip, that shows my character and how i deleted the infusion. But apparently that isn't enough proof. 
---
Kinda ironic that anet can't track the loss of the most valuable items in their game.
---
&gt; It only really overlaps if you're running right hand strength and have fury and spotter
---
full marauder is 60% crit chance
---
10% from burning
---
20% from fury
---
25% from retal
---
= 15% overcapped
---
and going for a marauders/bers/valk mix is a pointless loss of power and ferocity (compared to just gutting the marauders out entirely)
---
Not really a bug, but the german translation of the engi skill bulwark gyro is wrong, instead of saying redirects damage from allies to youself it says redirects damage from yourself to allies. Not sure if this is known, just wanted to point it out.
---
Reward-wise, is it worth it to complete the Personal Story after getting the BL Key from battle of claw island?
---
GW2 has ome of the best soundtracks out there, well done, and thank you! 😊
---
Hmm cheese rolls...  
---

---
I know 64 has a [nullification sigil](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_Nullification) choice.
---
Berserker is now uniquely restricted in it's window of power. Try it out and you'll notice how useless it feels outside of berserker, compared to before rework. And, it's now so much harder to charge it if headbutt doesn't land. 
---
Remember, prior to rework you can cast F1 burst or F2 burst every ~3 seconds with smart traits and runes. It's not necessarily stronger now.
---
Because GW1 music was done by Jeremy Soule and people said what you said exactly today.
---
This. I want actual end game progression.
---
Is living world season 2 mold on the bread?
---
Just because you don't agree with other answers doesn't mean they are unreasonable
---
You guard your allies by killing enemies before they can do harm. It makes perfect sense to me.
---
Full marauder is a waste anyway. Even wvw builds use maruder/berserker mix.
---
Bunboozled
---
The cheese looks awful and plastic.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
I love warthog. The knockdown is 3 seconds long, aka 33% longer than the next best thing. It's by far the heftiest hard cc rangers have access to. You land that on a player or npc and can unload every big Condi hit you got without retaliation.
---
And much better than crappy mount nerfs.
---
dont post
---
Game mechanics do not need lore explanations.
---
Specially in the Mists.
---
Never a break for Mouse Child
---
I will gladly not look at this abomination.
---
What about them? Freelancing means you make your own hours and your own prices - you don't need a union for that and you just take time off when you need it.

NSP

The keys are global. If you have the key, it should work.
---
He said the last patch would have been 3 weeks based on gem store items and we got the patch on Tuesday. I do predict a 7th of May release.
---
Two teasers back to back in early April and release end of Mai? If this is their way of shaking up old rhythms I want the silence-until-trailer cycle back
---
Sometimes lore makes mechanics, and sometimes mechanics make lore.
---
This ain't chess. There's always a story if you use your imagination, even in the mists.
---
I got hyper lucky: i bought HoT 2 days ago (and i was unsure on what exp buy), and today I got PoF from the Alienware giveaway. 
---
Problem is, I used a VPN being european. Do i risk something?
---
Also, since I don't want to play PoF before the other exp/seasons, i plan to unlock the warclaw. When i buy it does it unlock for every character? Or do i have to buy multiple times?
---
The Ultimate does not go on sale, no, because the 4k gem bundle is already a heavily discounted package. 
---
Depending on what you want to buy not everything is giftable, anything that alters the account (such as shared slots, bank tabs, character slots) isn't giftable. I'd check on your main account to see what's giftable before committing to this idea :)
---
I use Zealot, Viper and and Harrier because I like to spam boons and heals and burn things, but you should be perfectly fine with Berserker. 
---
It's relatively cheap and easy to obtain without crafting or trading post, if you visit Orr a bit or get PoF and do some Verdant Brink 5/5 metas you can get Berserker armor with relative easy. 
---
Weapons and armors are also cheap in WvW badge of honor vendors and they won't require expansions. You can get a full exotic set in a few days.
---
If you really, really want a bit more HP without too much DPS loss, go Marauder instead. You will have to craft it, but it doesn't require expansions.
---
It does, but you're still feeding the troll jerking his attempts at 'technically correct'.
---
But he hasn’t been “technically correct” in a single comment in this entire thread
---
If you playing from Argentina you probably should be on the NA servers that alone will down your ping to 200 or less, besides that VPNs actually dont work too much with gw2 usually i get a worst ping when using a vpn, the high ping that you are experiencing right now is probably a ISP problem.
---
&gt;Problem is, I used a VPN being european. Do i risk something?
---
Anet doesn't care, copies are global anyway.  However I have no idea if you broke the rules of the Alienware giveaway.
---
&gt;Also, since I don't want to play PoF before the other exp/seasons, i plan to unlock the warclaw.
---
Warclaw is PvP only, so if you want a mount in PvE, you need to get the raptor for completing Chapter 1 of PoF. You don't have to do any more than that unless you want the other mounts. 
---
&gt;When i buy it does it unlock for every character? Or do i have to buy multiple times?
---
Warclaw isn't purchased, you have to complete a collection for it as well as a WvW rewards track. It's more of a time sink (1-3 days) than a gold sink.  Raptor is freez but again locked behind chapter one of PoF.
---
Short answer is you dont. It's a stalemate, neither of you should be able to kill the other.
---
Not only the finishing... He was trash talking all the way
---
Heh, happens. Here &lt;°))))&gt;&lt;, should you decide to play with him some more. ;)
---
I dunno why you care if you get downvoted. In the grand scheme of things does it really matter?
---
Your info us right, let it be.
---
Does some NPC have Hair styles that is unavailable to player? Pretty sure I've seen some of them with unique Hair styles.
---
What's the point of this article?
---
well thats 100% your fault tbh... still sucks for you, but its more a players problem then ui problem,  you never should rush when handling with expensive stuff simple as that.  but I would suggest to try again to contact support, I always got my accidential thrown away items back  in less than 2 days.  and btw its not necessary to add screenshot of anything, they willl simply look up what happened on your account and then will decide.
---
I think this is the best of those...
---
&gt; More living story in the age of battle royal. Kinda like Kodak making cameras in the age of the iPhone.
---
like really, yeah EVERY game needs a Battle Royal game and when it sucks then the devs are at fault for not "listening to their community"...
---
&gt;I read on the wiki that it cost 8g to purchase.
---
It might (I'm still working on my last War law component) but it's not *just* a few, you have to unlock it via the collection first.
---
&gt;Side question, does the 1st chapter of PoF spoils anything of previous expansion/seasons?
---
&gt;I've read the synopsis
---
There are two main spoiler points.  One of them youre already aware of (Balthazar) and the other has something to do with Rytlock.  The chapter doesn't necessarilly spoil it, but the ending scene makes a lot more sense if you've already played the first half of Season 2, and know the general idea of where Rylock's been.
---
seconded; not as many extra buttons; but quality over quantity imo (and theyre much easier to press/reachable imo)
---
That's what I did and I haven't felt like I've spoiled much.
---
Suspended. I also do think its because I tried to use the credit card twice. Supper annoying, should have just bought it straight from the website instead of the in-game window
---
Thanks mate, much appreciated.
---
Well, they gave us Orr when it was the age of zombie games. They clearly lost their touch! :D
---
Yeah, Discretize updated their site, not up-to-date up-to-date, but most of the builds should work for fractals afaik
---
Did you have to grind the rank points for last tier or did they come naturally as you progressed through other achievements?
---
But it does in some sense shrink. More and more Karka spawn and block camps. Sure you can still go there, but only if you can handle the karma somehow.
---
Is this pvp armor?
---
then ppl should shut up in the first place.
---
Guild hall deco system is like they rushed to the butter first to make the fundation with.  Now that we keep stacking cheese pieces on this butter sandwich, we are realizing the butter is not so strong :o. It’s Iike we can only support 20 tiny cheese slivers per local area (never enough cheese!), and only 2000 cheese pieces total for all the sandwiches we will ever make :o. For the record that is only 4 cheese pieces per person if the guild has 500 people. Wat. Heck. We need a real fundation of bread so we can actually do the things! Tyty.

That ring collection started nearly a year and a half ago. It's both a new and an old ring.

Found it out myself: my exe was called "Guild Wars 2.exe", I needed to rename it to " gw2.exe " otherwise GeForce Experience will not find it
---
To generate traffic from people who are obsessed with "LOL GW2 DEAD GAME AMIRITE LMFAO" shitposting, judging by the comments
---
With almost everything being said already, I want to add one more thing.
---
As you may know, valkyrie gives you vitality which increases your hp stat. Most of the unavoidable damage in raids and fractals deals % hp damage (e.g. fractal agony, artsariiv bomb, vg greens, deimos damage after mind crush) and most of the healing in the game is flat health. Therefore, by taking more health your healer would need to spend more time healing you to 90% hp (which gives you a 5% damage boost due to scholar runes) while it doesn't really make you a whole lot tankier. If you are downing on full berserker you would probably down in full valkyrie as well.
---
I see! Thanks for the explanation :)
---
And I thought for your hard work, you could at least see how (actually) ...you did pretty much nail it.
---
Sorry for the potato-level graphics, I'm playing on a laptop at max performance which, the fuzziness actually sort of validates your picture more.

Play a lot or play consistently i get my daily 2 gold and be happy about it.  have a armorsmith(or leather/scribe) crafter and craft your armor .if you lucky like me i got 3 asc armor chests then stat changed
---
&gt;If you never checked out the game after these years again you wouldn't know that things have changed.
---
This reason is quite literally the source of everytime I heard someone complain about the game
---
Aside from that retarded "friend" of mine who thinks any content that's not a dungeon is shit by default
---
Ugh, you had to go and make it gross.
---
If you talking about the wings yes the ascension 
---
Chest boots gloves is usual asc gear 
---
Shoulders pvp asc skin
---
Legs dragonic

I think you're looking at copper. 
---
1 gold = 100 silver
---
100 silver = 10,000 copper.
---
If I buy something which costs 2 gold, 50 silver then I am in fact spending 25,000 copper.
---
Here's a [wiki link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Coin) to help you with it.
---
And it would be absolutely fantastic if this applied to every person freelancing. (And by the looks of it, this actually might be a situation with Didi here.) Sadly, the reality is that freelancing is being heavily used so that employers do not need to fully compensate a person for their work.
---
I think he sold something (but believing that gold go directly to your inventory), then bought something and when he/she went to the tp, got the item+gold.
---
Yes. Some npc use exclusive hair styles that were never released. Well, they were released by mistake once and very few players managed to get them, but that was ages ago. Those hair styles are not available on character creation nor the black lion kits
---
I got hit by 15k vault on 2.8k armor.
---
The hard part is the 15 day ach for each tier 
---
2 months of play if you lucky . I had to wait off season to finish 3-4 tier.
---
I'll be honest, I'm actually really bummed about the next content being a Living World Season 5. I've been hoping for a Cantha based expansion ever since this game came out, Factions was one of my favorite parts of GW1. Not to mention, a Living World release rather than an expansion really does make it seem like the game is barely getting by on life support.
---
Ehh, he was quite right about game not having clear direction until he tried to project this on the story and Cantha. I'm sure that story is written many, many months ahead, starting from HoT. 
---
But gamedesign wise game taks a sharp turn every ~1.5 years.
---
For a number of reasons, I'm gonna need new characters. The 3 classes I don't have are Necro, Ranger, &amp; Rev. I really only do PvE (not even the intense stuff yet) so are any of them exceptional in PvE in any way? I know they're all viable but is there anything I should know about them that I couldn't get from trying them out?
---
In other words, which class should I make next?
---
when you sell in the trading post, the money stays there until you retire it.
---
&gt;which gives your party 218 power every time you use your Bane Signet
---
You get that buff too, it got recently patched!
---
&gt; I'm assuming its just the apply burn on melee. 
---
And you are right. There is already a minor DH trait that does similar thing.  Expecting it to reset f1 cooldown is a bit too much, lol.
---
Yesh, that trait is on a roll.
---
change wvw!
---
I'd rather not play a game like I work on a job, thanks.
---
mmm lard
---
as long as even 1 % user their real info it is more than worth it for them
---
what are the ones you've already been playing?
---
The PoF expansion was released yesterday not on first day. First day was egg and outfit. Both of which were gone as of yesterday; the outfit was gone in less than 24hrs.
---
are you on a new account? as i learned a few weeks ago, apparently that is one of the features that fell victim to the "new player experience", and is hidden until you reach a certain level.
---
just a heads up; since we had a balance patch on Tuesday; these builds may change a bit as new rotations and priorities are figured out :)
---
That's terrible! Yeah. I started a new account becUse i couldnt for the life of me remember my stuff. Thank you for letting me know!!
---
that's because that's is the cheese they use on McDonalds. It has a name though, but I don't know what type of cheese that is.
---
Necro is good (amazing) for open world, but has no spot in meta comps for raid/fractals. 
---
Ranger Soulbeast is nice for open world, and they have a spot in endgame due to Druid. Although that is subject to change with the recent patches?
---
Revenant is seemingly the new meta comp along with Firebrand. Don't know how it plays solo.
---
adapt like new holo players do. you guys have become bursty now, now all you need is to fall in love with what you have. holosmiths also feel flaccid while not in holo mode, and the viable meta builds without becoming a pianist requires a considerable waiting period between cooldowns and and trying to time their explosive self flagellation so it isn't what sends them in a down state during a dps race. the update is still fairly,new, I'm waiting for builds to pop up for my zerker alt, I'm curious to what people like snow crow might adapt to recent changes
---
I was so happy to find the "Place Compact at Bottom of List" option in settings.
---
Didn't work for her though, I'll ask her to do it again
---
then we weren't on the same /v/
---
I had a lot of mmo mouses and from my experience has naga too small buttons and design flaws. Naga hex is way better - bigger buttons but only 6. G600 was only mouse I had to throw away design was strange buttons had weird shape only the 3rd thumb button was great. Now I have Corsair Scimitar Pro and I think its the best. Buttons are large enough and pad position can be adjusted
---
Yeah, that's exactly how it works and that's how it should be. It's extremely strong in Berserk mode (in competitive modes) and extremely weak outside of it.
---
It counterplayable, unique, and a fitting niche for the spec to have.
---
Make it customizable so I can choose which icons show up. Maybe a toggle icon the same gear menu?
---
Since when a jestful remark in a reddit comment qualifies as an essay?
---
&gt; The reason I think so is I was asked for raid carry by a person in the  past. I once helped him, but I told him that I wasn't going to help him  again for an obvious reason. Then he got mad at me and started personal  attacking, making rumors about me with his guildie and friend. 
---
An awful situation to be in, hope this gets resolved. The quoted bit stood out to me. I just cannot fathom bumping into such a person who'd accept help (in this case, person wanted to be carried) and then turn into a total trashbag because the kind person won't be \*carrying you\* further. - This was all besides the point, but it stuck out.
---
Even better!
---

And if you are really greedy , not only can you do orphan runs daily , you can pop all karma buffs and grind bells , and/or the JP. You get a really decent stream of gold plus a crazy amount of karma. It's just mind-numbing.
---
Yeah you could do dungeons or kill bandit executioners xD
---
Get in a LWS 4 event train , while having karmic retribution 3 in the relevant maps. Also , wvw gives pretty good karma if you concentrate on capping objectives, not zerging for bags. Plus, doing the LWS 3 and LWS 4 easy fast dailies build it up pretty quick. For retrib. and the karma in daily chests buffs don't matter , but in wvw there's several buffs to really crank up your gain easily. ( +65% very easily ).
---
Wvw larger than pvp, raids and fractals together..what a time to be alive.
---
Can’t wait until they add bacon to if
---
Why would you care about the damage your pet was doing when you're playing a pure support?
---
If you aren't playing Druid to be a healer than play something else because that's what it is.
---
That's the joke. Some streamer was complaining about this (in the current menu), so they added a toggle option to move it.
---
no-one said thats where it takes place.  The whole point of the festival is to celebrate wvw/pvp so thats the theme of it.
---
They don't go on hiatus, it isn't like the devs just sit around in between seasons. That time is used to storyboard and make tech for the new season.

Some do!

Jim Richardson from NatGeo uses an iPhone to take some professional pictures.  Brad Mangin is another photog who actually exclusively uses an iPhone; iPhone cameras are pretty crazy now.  Still, for most people a real camera is definitely better, just because of the extra tools they offer.

Having listened to music in areas he composed for, and music in areas he didn't compose for, I kind of feel like this is a bit of overhype. He did good work, but the HoT/PoF music is better and he had no hand in that.

Full berserker. You used to be able to get away with a fair amount of Valkyrie because you got 50% extra crit chance from Retaliation, but that trait has now been nerfed to 25%.
---
It's okay to say "shit" on the internet, you know? You don't have to try and disguise it with symbols - especially since profanity is still profanity even if you try to hide it.
---
Necros are quite a versetile class since you can play them as Healers*(rally bots lel)* power and condition dps. Problem with Necros is they're often times recommended for newer players for their ease of play, wich kinda diminishes their Image in endgame because most Necros are total scrubs ffs.
---
There is not much space in endgame content for Necro DPS since its not burst orientated enough to keep up with other classes. If the boss phases out and despawns or get invulnerable because four other guys in your team bursted him to pieces in under 5 seconds, you can't really apply any damage.
---
Necros however are really usefull if you're running with newer groups or less experienced teammates since then you can actually apply some sustained damage. Where those bursty classes would tumble down you can build up and reach their potential - its just not as effective tbh.
---
Playing this game since release but I don't even know one of them.

I brain farted :(

Ah. Guess i was thinking about this from a european perspective.
---
This is probably one of the hardest games to become famous in. I suspect this is because of how it's actually an instanced game with no world chat. This is exaserbated by how players cannot choose which map instance they travel to and that maps don't hold enough players to have a person really become memorable. I have been told I'm famous in game which has also been backed up by Forum posts about my antics, but I know that although my fame in uniquely earned, it is overshadowed by people getting famous just for landing themselves at the top of the leaderboard season after season.

I see what you did there xD

Oh yeah there's some iPhone contests that take good pictures, but they don't really compare to a real camera.

I did the jump from the airship every day for over 2 years and finally stopped a few months ago. Damn if it wasn't addicting, though.
---
Was there a recent change to the graphics in the game? I'm trying to return from after a few months but now the game runs like a slideshow for me regardless of where I am. There have been no changes to my pc configuration which ran the game smoothly before.
---
Darn missed it :(
---
I also have the g600 and with my tiny girl hands it can absolutely feel like a handfull. I got use to holding it a little higher than I hold other mice. Now that I've played with it for so many years I literally cannot play without it. It totally solved my 6-9 problem and I remapped my elite to E so I hardly have to move my left hand at all to play.

Nah don't worry. In pve even mesmer players hate the class.

Holy shit. My mom came into my tent to bring me a Plate of Fire Flank Steak and I literally screamed at her and hit the Plate of Fire Flank Steak out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the curtains on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Evon Gnashblade to be have a seat on the Captain's Council and fix this broken city. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was polling well in Smokestead???? This is so fucked.

Ah, I have work at that time, would never be able to make it unfortunately. Thanks for the information anyways.

I managed to solo the champ alpha beetle for the roller beetle collection with my DH longbow (because I didn’t really know any better) but I think I’d have had a better time with sc/focus...there’s better things to pewpew with in pve imo, like ranger longbow, deadeye, or thief pistol/pistols. DH longbow is okay for open world but people might not like it if you go to fractals or something with that.......

Her name is Flame Tender and she's a Weaver. Because, well, fire swords and fire effects around her hands. Also spent a while farming the Koda's Blessing Infusion for this just because it really cements the Dark Souls 3 aesthetic imo. And the Estus Flask focus is just fun.

#IS THAT A SHORT JOKE?
---
I think in a game this old botting is a necessity for some things because the volume of players needed is too low.
---
When your game economy heavily relies on bots since years and you suddenly ban bots and people that got cons from them. Feelsweirdman
---
That's not the point. The "point" is, that this is one of the easiest, fastest and repetitive methods of farming a decent chunk of masses each day. The problem? This post comes months too late, and everyone I know did this back then already. It's hardly relevant now, and hardly a new tip.
---
I found I had more of the jewels I need ed than Branded Masses. But that's probably because I've been slacking on mining the nodes.
---
Berserker. I've mained guardian since launch and I used to try to run Soldiers for everything. It made the game feel 10 times harder and more frustrating. Ascended power berserker DH is standard meta for Guardian in raids. PvE content in this game is easy enough, Berserker's will teach you when to dodge and how to maneuver properly in fights and you won't lose any DPS for trying to play with more HP that is, in all cases in GW2, unnecessary for a DPS if you know the fights and mechanics. Don't give yourself training wheels. Invest in a big kid bike and teach yourself to ride.

Yeah and it would take 10 years of doing this to complete the collection. Its so grindy.

Yeah, I've been following it too and it seems like botting is pretty common. tbh, I think anyone botting gw1 at this point is just trying to either (1) farm HoM or (2) desperately trying to find a way to keep enjoying their favorite mmo. For a game that old, I'm not sure banning botters will accomplish anything other than losing even more of the few players still active in it.
---
&gt; For a game that old, I'm not sure banning botters will accomplish anything other than losing even more of the few players still active in it.
---
Maybe thats their goal? They probably keep evaluating every year or so, if its worth the server costs to keep it running.
---
It might be worth for them to do it for (example) 5000 regular players but not for 200 players with 25 bot accounts each.
---
I am from SF).
---
This specific kind of content really pisses me off, tbh.
---
Has there been any cross-race relationships in the entirety of Guild Wars 2? I can't recall any at all.
---
You can do it in 30 sec by doing the med kit thing instead. You need to throw 2 medkits to the group of 3 healers and the heart is filled.
---
That's the thing, they can.  The API can even keep history of account value.
---
I never played gw2, so i dont know much about the player base, botting or the hacks used to run the bots.
---
But if those bot programs can potentially be used to farm in gw1 and in gw2 as well, I would understand, if Anet bans linked gw2 accounts of gw2-botters as well because the chance is high that they will be using that program for both games.
---
In sPvP, the defence stat isn’t accruing for any players at all (meaning everyone finishes with 0% of team and no one gets it as top stat). Gotta love this spaghetti code.

I've not played FFXIV, but I can't think of FF without mentioning the brilliance of Nobuo Uematsu.

But on point, going waaay back there is also the "iMuse" system of Monkey Island 2 which comes to mind, a brilliant feature many never noticed sadly.
---
 This one is caught. Einhar will take it?
---
That's specifically for core Guardian and Dragonhunter. Firebrand is a very strong support, which can also flex as a condi DPS.
---
Deleting accounts is a totally different process. It's an elaborate legal thing with GDPR; customers *have* to request it.
---
If you thought before posting you would understand the difference between whether something is, and the perception that something is. Outside of the GW2 community there is a very real perception that GW2 is not a very active game. The idea of "living world episodes?" versus a MMORPG expansion pack enforces that misconception of slow/low content updates. If there wasn't you wouldn't be seeing articles like this where people are legit surprised the game isn't going under after the layoffs.
---
I thought the world was a vampire...
---
Mirage is somewhat overpowered in PvE Raid encounters, though it's mostly related to how raid bosses trigger confusion. The hate for the class is definitely from people who have to fight *against* the class.
---
New to MMO’s (first MMO was Black Desert Online which I’ve been playing for about a month now) and wondering if I should pick up an MMO mouse. Haven’t needed it for BDO but this game utilizes way more numbers and F-keys than anything I’ve ever played. 
---
Do most use MMO mice?
---
Yeah, except the real reason they didn't plan a new expansion is because they'd moved the xpac team to new projects.
---
You act as if MMORPGs haven't been suddenly shut down in the middle of active development before. Regardless of how you feel, the current perception of GW2 is that its going downhill and that idea is enforced by the layoffs and the decision to halt expansions. Expansions are understood by the general MMORPG community as large infusions of new content, people that don't play GW2 don't know what the hell a Living World Season is. 
---
Plus your hostile attitude towards disappointment at the lack of a Canthan expansion, which has been a requested thing since launch, is the sort of thing that turns even more people away. Do you actually want less players in this game?
---
Tibalt Leftpaw for Sainthood!
---
Apples so good you'll cry. 😭
---
The board flipping the picture should be red. Booooo!
---
I LOVED Season 2. It is still my favourite season by far.
---
The story was great, the missions were diverse and fun, the achievements were just the right amount of painful.
---
Yeah exactly. Doing this heart on multiple characters is trivial. Serpentite is the trash one locked to many real world days of scheduled metas and/or the dwarf puzzle.
---
I wouldn't mind this if not for the fact that you need Serpentite to stat swap armor to diviners. If it was just for shiny stuff or achievement points it'd be fine.
---
Curiously, it didn't feel anywhere near that long
---
I recommend it, for two separate reasons.
---
The first is the story itself. I'm not going to mince words: The core story of the original game, not including expansions or Living World stuff, is not very good. Bad, even.
---
Occasionally it will have some clever writing or interesting lore, but the presentation of it really hampers any real enjoyment. It honestly feels like Arenanet spent all sorts of time building the tools to make good content, and then tan out of time or didn't understand how to use the awesome tools they made.
---
**However**, each subsequent section, the production value goes up. Season 2 is higher quality than Core. Heart of Thorns is higher quality than Season 2. Season 3 has a higher production quality than Heart of Thorns.
---
When we get to the Path of Fire and Season 4 era, the story is actually really good. And to understand what's going on, you really do need to play all the rest of the story, preferably in order.
---
The second reason is that it serves as a content guide. Each of the later zones has something going on it it worth doing, and it can be overwhelming. But the story follows a linear path through the zones.
---
So you start, say, the Path of Fire story. It introduces you to mounts and takes you around the first PoF zone. Noe you can spend some time exploring, doing bounties, collecting Hero and Mastery Points, and so on. When you've exhausted it, you can continue the story. It'll then take you to the second zone, give you a new mount, show you around. Rinse and repeat.
---
When you personally feel done in an area, the answer to "Where to next?" Becomes "Follow the story until it takes you somewhere new"
---
Gonna miss those NSP guys.
---
The ban waves are for people participating in botting resources and mats like ecto and Z Keys
---
Asshat? Were am i a asshat, be specific please. Because the only thing i been saying is that i personally am bothered. So here is what we will do. If you expect further answers from me then keep to what i actaully said instead of making shit up that i never EVER even touched. If not then i am done here.
---
I've always found it amazing how no matter what time of the day it is, no matter what day in the week, what month of the year it is there was high chance of seeing Jadexi talking random stuff in map chat. Good times.

As both a GW2 and BDO player, having a mouse (not ness a mmo specific or gaming mouse) helps a lot. However, until BDO, you can customize everything in this game so you can change the F-keys to something else if you’d like.

Uematsu started doing the FFXIV music (in 1.0), but Soken took over it for Reborn. Uematsu was usually responsible for the main theme of each expansion. Soken got a [Guinness world record](https://www.inverse.com/article/37691-final-fantasy-xiv-music-music-a-realm-reborn-masayoshi-soken-guinness-world-records) for the most original pieces of music in a video game, so he's been pretty influential at least on FFXIV.
---
I love Uematsu's work, especially in FFX. But, since I play FFXIV as an MMO, I hear Soken's work so often. Not counting Stormblood (the expansion that just finished), it was 384 original pieces of music that Soken's done.
---
For a good example of how the music is used in context, [Unending Coil of Bahamut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jnev2mILXs) uses the music really well (especially see about 6:12 onwards). Answers was written by Uematsu, but this arrangement is done by Soken (I think). That's from the hardest raid in FFXIV.
---
A good Soken only example is the last raid of the Heavenward expansion, Alexander and the song [Rise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4QgQ1pUlA) which is used for the second half of the fight. Or [Wayward Daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMv9uiQsXvg) from one of the fights from Stormblood. Note that for Rise the raps were done and written by the English localization lead. He often does the lyrics for the songs. Some songs have the lyrics done by the head of the lore team (for the Japanese lyrics) and the same localization lead (for the English lyrics).
---
Lastly, I'll give case in point to the [Shadowbringers trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tyuIh12_HU) which has stunning music. It's also a fantastic example of how to put together a trailer for your expansion. Shadowbringers is the first time Uematsu didn't do the main theme for the FFXIV expansion (since he's ill). So, that trailer has Soken's Shadowbringers theme in it.
---
Note that it doesn't stop the community from memeing on the music at times. Sometimes, the lyrics aren't the easiest to figure out, so people have their own [misheard lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYSe1RIfLb8). The song Rise was another one where people had their own interpretations. But, the chicken tenders and ancient eggrolls thing has been so prevalent that people from Square Enix have referenced it in passing and in an April's Fool's joke this year, while a woman was cooking chicken tenders and asked the home assistant to play "romantic music" that song came on right at the chicken tenders part.
---
GW2 does have some really good music at points, but FFXIV I think has the best MMO music. I think having a dedicated composer that works tightly with the rest of the dev team is a big part of that.
---
Soken is pretty beloved by the FFXIV community, his music is a big part, but he's also a big [goofball](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/b43dor/as_per_usual_soken_being_soken/) [\(exhibit 2\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/amcy9o/yoshi_sokendont_be_weird_today_soken/) and probably the [best example](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/9xtfbw/soken_is_a_walking_otamatone_shitpost_at_fanfest/) from a concert he did at a fanfest.

Guild Wars 2: All (f)or Nothing

The only one that has true double meaning.
---
Yours reminds me a lot of 2B from Nier.
---
Oh so that's what he was actually saying...Jesus.
---
Never heard of you.
---
Is that tejbz?
---
This looks like it was done with matplotlib and wordcloud library
---
Lol, forgot about the whole currency stuff, did not meant to say i grabbed a lot of keys, is that here were i live the xpacks cost 120 bucks each, so i saved 120 bucks in my currency, but grabbed only one key hehe.

&gt;PvE classes rarely get hate (and if they do, its for stupid reasons)
---
Ooookay buddy. So saturating Mesmers for a few bosses because confusion **confusion is being ignored on the balance table** is a stupid reason. 
---
The fact that *while there are alternatives to Chrono, pugs can't and won't grasp that fact* is also another stupid reason I imagine? 
---
Dude, if you're gonna diss a mode, at least make sense first. Please and thank you.

You can only go through them on a Jackal
---
TL;DR: you need the jackal mount
---
It’s from one of the Jackal masteries, you’ll eventually be able to go through them. Think of PoF as a Metroidvania style game, where you gain new abilities that open up new paths in areas you’ve already explored.

On EU if you spent some time in LA you would 100% see Jadexi in map chat and/or Rasman in front of the bank.
---
He was perma banned right?
---
Monkey is in it starting at 10m 40s.
---
I really like the idea that the already toxic raid community is being even more pathetic and petty. Sorry about your account, still funny though.
---
Tbh if u can find a bundle price or a special sale this game with both expansions is cheap af.  Save up some money and w8 for the next sale when it is announced, the prices are really low for the amount of content and new features  you get. For me gliding and mounts alone are more than enough justification to spend the money.
---
Although for a brand new player core game will provide huge amounts of gameplay time, the experience with mounts, gliding and a few other masteries just changes dramatically.
---
Didn't realize you could do that, thank you.
---
Well, you like it, then keep it.
---
I'd rather have the option to remove it altogether.
---
Luckily, the Division 2 has Anthem there to make it look like a fucking shining beacon sent from god, even if it does have quite a bit of issues.
---
Surprised that Xar wasn't in the video
---
People banned for almost a decade were able to recover their accounts, so yeah, they're never truly deleted.
