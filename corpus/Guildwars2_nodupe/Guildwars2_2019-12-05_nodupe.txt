Living season, the content releases between expansions
---

---
It currently goes base game-&gt;season 1-&gt;season 2-&gt;HoT-&gt;season 3-&gt;PoF-&gt;season 4-&gt;season 5 (or saga as they want it to be known now).

---
I don't care about the clipping. It's the ugly way the cape sticks out.
---
Just that thanos is ancient greek for death. I thought it was kinda edgy back then, and I've kept up with it since then.
---
I think the joy I personally get out of it is that you're not tied to AOE fields like you are on renegade (granted the aoe fields are large, and in harder pve content you're typically stacks) but I like just having the buffs pulse out from my character, instead of a field on the ground.   
---
I'm not sure how you have your keybinds set up, but my utility skills are F, R, and G, so whenever I swap to Herald i just do a quick roll of my fingers and all my facets are up.
---
As long as I agree with everything you said (most of it) - it's still just a veteran player perspective. Don't forget he is a new player and this is going to be a HUGE time sink for him. There is so much to do.
---
GW2 has its own cons, but the pros still outweight them. For a newcomers this game is a jackpot tbh.
---
I'm a WoW player myself (former,kinda) and GW2 is a perfect replacement for it. I don't have much left to do, but still having a lot of fun. Also it's nice that you can "quit" GW2 whenever you want, comeback later and don't be left far behind. 
---
We should promote this game for newcomers instead of writting very negative comments imo.
---
There are two main problems I have with this:
---
1. If they gave this level of detail on all bans - it would allow those who are doing things that lead to bans to be much more elusive when they exploit - and that would make it much more difficult to keep the game fair for all players.    
---
e.g. Player does behavior X, Y, Z.  They get a temp ban and are told it was for behavior Y. They either stop doing behavior Y (or modify it slightly to make it more difficult to detect) but keep doing X and Z.
---
2. Giving this level of detail is a lot more work for their support workers - and they undoubtedly have a lot of cases they have to go through.  Making more work for them means fewer support cases get answered in a timely manner. 
---
As has been noted before, there are times when bans are done incorrectly - and it those cases it sucks that the player needs to put such an extra effort to get unbanned.  But statistically speaking those are very rare - and having Anet make such a change that would help cheaters 99.9% of the time, but aid innocents 0.1% of the time is not a good idea.
---
Yes, breaking the mirror will give you mirage cloak, which is the mirage special mechanic that replaces dodges and gives you access to your ambush skill
---
I'm not the one struggling to make things up about the "casuals". Also, you didn't tell me if you are playing on EU or NA.
---
They really need to market their new multi-angled capes.
---
I would prefer to also have setting to determine priority for what will appear on the back.
---
Like this in archeage:

---
you mean that if I try to alter a build template that I'm not using I can't change pets if I'm merged? I don't even think you can alter templates unless you're using them..
---
Just hearing the word "Migrane" is giving me a migrane. I still haven't even come close to completing that achievement. They really knew what they were doing when they named it that, lol.
---
Well you're right for phase 1 but what about the other phases? Pre-cast barrage, firestorm, and OWP counted for over 1/3rd of their DPS. I'm not saying SB can't have good burst or even beat others in the right scenarios but they don't have the sustained damage to keep that up a full fight. You know better than most people, being with dT and all, that phase timings and pre-casting will change a lot.
---
No "elite" player is going to be excited over getting gold on these.
---
OK  Fixed by using LEFT ALT  (before patch I was using Right Alt)
---
What? Healer? Does he actually attack? I thought it was the new base dps golem.
---
This would be my #1 requested feature if I thought there was a chance it would ever happen.
---
It clips outfits aswell.
---
It was. Doing anything with UI for guild wars is incredibly complicated because of the spaghetti code.
---
So they are addressing PvP and wvw needs and that equates to abandoning PvP? They've even adjusted AT schedule and universally people are happy about this because they can attend ATs finally. Based on what you responded with, you sound like a filthy casual who is bored because you've accomplished nothing and are all out of stuff to do. I hear WoW classic released...
---
The beauty of support classes is that a lot of personal modification can be done and can be justified. Personally I like Pure of Heart (aegis you grant to allies heals when broken) and Writ of Persistence (symbols grant ticking healing). I really like having additional skills that heal allies. This makes you not so dependent on the cooldowns of fewer skills, so you always have multiple stacking sources of healing available at all times.
---
that's... not wicthhunting, but ok
---
Yeah but what does living world seasons do? Whats the use of playing them? Is it just story wise or what does it give?
---
[Here you go](https://imgur.com/0fdTsnv)...
---
More farming maps. Ascended accessories. Collections. Even more farming maps
---
So the farming maps arent accesible without living world?
---
I really really want to upvote you, but "their"... really sorry.. just can't do it :(
---
Well twitch isn't primarily about watching the game unless it's specifically tournaments.
---
Twitch at least for me is essentially just a different long form podcast/YouTube video. Interaction with chat is really important which means most big streamers just ignore it, and that I think hurts what makes twitch an interesting platform.
---
In the end you don't come because of the game, but because of the person.
---
It'd probably be concidered a two handed weapon, like the staff for the thief for exemple. Animation would fit this and use both hands.
---
The bonfires set ice brood that walk through on fire making them easier to damage. It only works for the ones that get on or near the fire though
---
Ah right, that didn't occur to me. Animations similar to what they did for daredevil would be magnificent too.
---
The only thing they reduced is the fun of the traits. 
---
They could at least bring them back as some kind of consumable or something, but nope. Gone forever.
---
The ratio is for sure not 99.9% vs 0.1%. So there is that.
---
And there is no perfect scenario, however, Anet is **really** one of the worst to deal with if you are innocent. There is plenty of room to improve before it is a problem in the way you tell. It will just cost them some money, money i believe would be spent well.
---
big sad
---
not even close to as nice... the gross ornament up top... and the cape doesnt even go down far enough... nice try tho
---
yea, i think i've basically quit since i can't login in without crashing like 5min after, thought i might be arc but doesn't seem like it is any issue with mods, but the crashing seems to happen all over the place not just in WvW
---
Thas a cape!!!
---
They were added in the latest patch (dyable skin for backpieces), and they are a reward for succsessfully spending 500 gems in the store!
---
I love it!
---
Naturally. 
---
Thanks, Anet.
---
o.O   
---
lol
---
I'd like a toggle keybind for dynamic UI, instead of one I have to hold.
---
Polymock
---
New mysteries collections, and mounts in the case of season 4.
---
Yeah its 60.
---
All said and done though, by the time I actually got the glider out of a box, I think I had bought around 80 keys. Not insane, but definitely more than what was probably responsible given my budget at the time.
---
I  occasionally buy gambling items, just as I occasionally enjoy going to the casino irl, but what frustrates me with the reasoning behind it is that he said this in 2017, but in the time since then, they have released gambling only items and made them available for non gambling purchase later, so its not as if that was a real sticking point to begin with, and I really have to wonder with select licenses being what, 3x the cost of a random, how many people would actually be that upset about it if they changed it? At a normal cost of 400 gems in a pool of 30 skins, if you're willing to gamble on that, you're probably either interested in multiple skins or a whale anyway. I imagine most people in my shoes would look at those odds and go "nty, I don't want it that bad." and just be miffed about it. 
---
Though honestly if it was only out of 10 or so skins I probably would be willing to play the odds.
---
thats nice to hear
---
It was quite easy. Finished with a 5 man group in 4 minutes
---
Dude commendations are practically useless if you already have ascended trinkets.
---
They did mention it was bugged (I think it was about the open world version) and should have been harder. The strike was supposed to be harder again so I think a similar but crept in. 
---
Everyone is a bit antsy since the layoffs, saga reveal and build templates, but to their credit they do keep delivering on exactly what they say they will. Such as releases being smaller but more frequent, bug fixes, templates being exactly as they described, splitting balance for PvP, PvE and WvW, and so on.
---
To be fair they are delivering on exactly what they say they will. The community have always had issues with how they interpret updates from Arenanet. For example, getting upset that we haven't seen "expansion level" content yet when they stated the updates will be smaller but on a more frequent cadence and the expansion level content was meant as an "over time" one and not "every release will be expansion worthy"
---
I'm remaining hopeful that episodes 2, 3 or 4 will add some features more akin to what we see in expansions like new features, skills, mounts, mysteries, etc.
---
Lets just see what 2020 brings. They really don't have a choice now but to follow through.
---
The emblem is the point though, isn't it?
---
Love the fact that you mentioned it IS a gem store related issue.
---
From my personal experience as a game designer, I can tell you that basically everything you think is easy is hard, and many of the things you think will be too hard are easy. From a programming standpoint that is.
---
Bottoms line: you can never assume what is easy and what isn't in game dev. It's actually just super hard.
---
Missing mine two nights in a row. I submitted a bug and I expect it'll be fixed... Eventually... With little recouping for the lost progress of materials I'm sure.
---
Are you in the early game or level 80?
---
Posting this comment before deleting post in another hour.
---
Ran the strike again, and it was a cakewalk. I'm guessing the first group was a lower skilled group, making it harder than I had personally seen before. Still was a nice experience to have to learn the mechanics, wiping a few times and communicating with the others instead of just beating it to death in 4 minutes flat.
---
Yeah, their general policy is to not mention things unless it's 100% going to ship, because this community looooves turning Maybes into Promises.
---
open world used to have a lot more people though. and it used to be  a lot more social because there were no guides no wiki, everybody was a noob back then. ahh the good old memories of 2012.
---
I thought I was alone thinking that way. it ruins the views.
---
Hit H and view your story journal. Welcome back to the game btw! I have a comprehensive guide that'll be very useful for you and for anyone you introduce to the game. It can be found at bit.l
---
Oh baby, these take me back.
---
I get that they announced not every release would be expansion level, but maybe they shouldve made one of the first 3 patches have something expansion level. A cape and a boss that can be auto'ed down isnt exactly mounts, gliders, elite specs, or raids.
---
And Space Marines joining the battle. For the Emperor !
---
We haven't had the third release yet. The recent patch was QoL only. The gemstore releases also continue along a separate cadence (albeit with overlap) to the content releases.
---
You should try condi DD, it feels (well, felt) great in pve but then got polio in pvp.
---
Yeah, didn't know that at the time, otherwise I would've not spent the money, so if it was established, it was established in a way that I never knew about. I mostly just lurk around here, dont really look at Twitter or official forums or anything.
---
Lol Elite PvE what’s that?
---
&gt; Boneskinner isn’t difficult at all
---
They aren't addressing pvp and WvW needs though, AT and the swiss matchmaking is the least of what spvp needs. And given the hardcore pvp and wvw communities have largely left the game its nothing to do with casuals.
---
Prove it.
---
I guess you'll just have to *veg* out for now. But perhaps I'm *barking* up the wrong *tree*.
---
Still hoping i'll be able to disable people's names/mastery points etc when on party/squad.
---
No, it isn't. Making a legendary for the stat swapping is the worst, least efficient, least convenient thing to do with your gold, besides outright deleting it.
---
Praise Joko!

These are Skill Pins that were given out with the collectors edition of Guild Wars: Nightfall.
---
It's a visual bug, I see it very often when playing WvW. After that abnormally high jump you will usually see that player sprinting forward at a higher speed, because that's where that player actually is (they did a long jump on their end, not a high jump), and the server (or your client?) is trying to catch up.
---
He's very similar to Superman in that sense. The stories are less about his overcoming enemies with his power than they are about him mentally overcoming the barriers that he creates.
---
The first two strike missions released with the new episode were anything but 111111 encounters, tho.

I'm fine with the strike missions being the way they are. I don't feel the rewards are worth making the missions frustrating and difficult. I pretty much went through all the possible uses for ice shards and ertrite ingots by day 3 of the last patch. I only do the strike missions now for the ingots but only because parading all my alts through the maze would be boring to do every day and I'm only collecting those out of paranoia that they might be needed in the future. I've got nearly 1250 ice shards now and I haven't even been trying to collect those.
---
Anyway, ideally the rewards should match the effort and I feel the current rewards match the current effort. A more interesting fight would be fun but if they do that the rewards should be improved.
---
hello my post keeps getting removed from the subreddit what do i do?
---
yeah but the hating reddit community is just ignoring these release, because "thats not what we wanted" !
---
Since I play WvW a lot yes it seems to be a visual bug; happens to a lot of players when they leap off/down cliffs. They're not actually that high in the air just weird to see.
---
Yep, because that’s not what we wanted
---
I'm certain this is merely the first in line for many different styled capes in future. We're bound to get single dye channel basic ones to more flamboyant or even edgier rugged capes. I mean let's be real here... players been asking for capes for ages anet would be silly not to release more. Literal gold mine there akin to mounts/gliders.
---
Maybe you wouldn’t be downvoted to oblivion if you’ve just kept your lack of appreciation to yourself like a normal human being
---
Sometimes, you have to move within range of the boss yea
---
Exactly my point. If I had the 10, I would have bought it. But I have 4. And not one of my guilds does missions anymore since they maxed out their levels.
---
For every 25% mechanic you miss during the fight, you get one less reward
---
we all been there :)
---
You all were crying so hard about the lack of content but this patch was enough to make you all claim it's the best patch so far.

That says a lot.

yes especially the first

Here is the thing. They have had 2 releases so far in this so-called Saga. While I understand that you can't have everything on a whim it is still beyond me how ArenaNet can sell their "goodfaith token" over and over again. The positive-thinking side of the community is like the Miami Dolphins of the NFL. Keep the faith, next year is ours, dn't be negative, keep on hoping and so on. If you decide to watch a new series and you have the pilot and the first episode and it is mediocre or let's just say does not bring any new or extraordinary to the table, you won't say, oh come on, let's wait for the 2nd season let's give them the benefit of the doubt. ArenaNet does not need protection or endless goodwill, they are a studio and what's more a successful studio making a good amount of profit. Now, I love the devs, I love their game but it is more than clear that they have always had structuring issues, they never had a clear overarching vision what this game should really look and feel like. They are swimming with the current and trying to figure things out as they are progressing. Lot of new ideas, then lot of scrapped and abandoned ideas. I was really hopeful for this Saga, but they emphasised 2 things that got me excited. 1. Strike Missions. Well, we have seen 4 of them, and they are nowhere near what I had thought they'd be. They are cool in esthatics and cool as a design but gameplay-wise they are just one-dimensional and lackluster. Plus for the love of Dwayna, why can't we have some kind of reward System tied to it? I don't mean gold or mats but some skins or anything at all. 2. New masteries. I thought that masteries will be the forerunner of the promised Xpack features. Well, the new mastery is jackshit. No other way around it, it is useless, boring and nothing out-of-the-box. 
---
While I like the story and the map is gorgeous, I don't think that 1.) they held on to their promises. Because come on. They said: strikes, raven mastery, boneskinner, djakar. Nothing else. If they had anything else in the bag, don't you think they would have presented it to us in order to convince us that the Saga is a good thing? Well, they are about to figure out what to ship starting in February, believe me. 2.) They played out the "goodfaith token" one too many times already and they failed more times then not (unsteady cadences, neglected WvW, 1 raid and fractal per year and so on). That being said, I love GW2 and will continue to play it as it is the best MMO on the market right now but that does not mean that I will not admit it flaws. I'm convinced that we will see an expansion in 2021 but up until then we have to feed on the scraps.
---
Made me chuckle, thanks
---
If raids are PvE then WvW is just PvP. Raids are an entirely separate thing from core GW2 PvE.
---
Raids are no more PvE than WvW is PvP. It an entirely distinct mode.
---
If you are talking about new posts and not questions here or replies then it's probably because they either do not respect some of this sub [rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules) and/or because enough people report it for the same motive and the new post gets auto-moderated away. Depending on what you wanted to say/ask maybe here could be a very good place to do so ad if you feel that some of your post were removed/auto-moderated way why they shouldn't have been you can always [contact the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGuildwars2).
---
&gt; The neat thing about capes being added so late in the game
---
Neat is not how I'd describe it. Money grubbing maybe.
---
It was right before this post. That sounds right to me lol
---
The game always had 3 core game modes, PvP, WvW and PvE. Raids fall under the PvE tag, as do dungeons and fractals.
---
And just on a side note, you can only earn envoy armour in raids. PvP and WvW have legendary armour yes, but its not envouy armour.
---
Just the one side or everyone?
---
Man, these skills carry so much weight. I’m not just referring to nostalgia, but these were poweful build defining skills.
---
 OK, now I’m nostalgic. Gw2’s skills are just  not as unforgetable as gw1.
---
Both times my entire team. The other team was fine.
---
I usually stack magic find paasive during that but ppl are too lazy
---
It was tongue in cheek.
---
Are you talking about the lack lustre weapon set we got this time around?
---
I think it is cause youre burning duration would overcap and burning is your main dmg output.
---
So its better to get more cond dmg instead.
---
Could be wrong but i think thats why.
---
That's also my thinking but same as you. Idk if my assumptions are right. Prefer understanding the build.
---
Of course, it's a Charr problem. Not even surprised. :D
---
Awesome, always a great feeling to know I'm helping people out :)
---
23.3k total. That's an average of 2.3k per player, which is auto-attacking level of damage.
---
I’m impressed you had the mental fortitude to do the skyscale within your first month. Living and breathing LW4 hearts took a toll on me.
---
Invest in a gamepad then.
---
I can garantee you character bound keymaps aren't comming anytime soon. You may as well just try to find some keyboard profile software and work around it like that. anet won't loose time developing such a niche thing that they won't be able to monetize and will only impact people who have small hands or are playing with 1995 keyboards where keys are separated by 2cm.
---
&gt; I can't help but feel that this has a lot to do with the player count dropoff as of late
---
This is how I also feel.
---
&gt; I'll only be truly impressed if they keep working on improving these things rather than forget about them the moment they're released...
---
I think you hit the nail in the head with this one. I fully agree. There are a lot of things left unfinished.
---
Whats the point of buying the ghostly infusion if you dont want the effect? For the +5 stat? Isnt it cheaper then to sell the infusion and get a +9 +5 stat infusion?
---
I'm not saying I don't want it, of course I do, just being reasonable. It would take too much work, it's not monetizable, it's a niche (most casual players only have 1 character and are playing the default keys probably). And it's solvable with a software that allows profiles for keyboards/mouses.
---
I wouldn't want them to waste time developing such a feature when it could be used developing something else more interesting for the overall playerbase, and that's just it.
---
I understand the point. I just wish there was a non emblem version.
---
I don't disagree with you. I probably didn't emphasise the last part enough but I do believe they are in a corner now. They don't have a choice given the past year but to follow through and knuckle down. 
---
All I was highlighting is that in fairness to them They showed us and told us what we would get and they delivered exactly that. The raven mastery was shown and talked about. The maps too. The story. It was all as they said it would be. Our disappointment came from expecting more than it would be.
---
I understand your analogy but let's face it we have more than just the pilot and second episode. We've had a core release, 4 other seasons and 2 expacs. It's not the same to ignore everything that came before and throw out hope only on these 2 episodes they win some favor, but as I'm emphasising, not much. It's been too many tries at innovation and restructure when all we want is focus. Too many weird promises and slow delivery cadences. And too many fuck ups. Their back is against the wall. 
---
But in fairness to them. They said what we wpuld get and we got it. If that is an indicator then I expect expansion level content by the end of the saga. If they deliver, then fair play to them.
---
The skins themsel would be really cool without the emblem too. I just actively avoid them because I want to rep a guild, but their logo absolutely doesn't fit my look.
---
It is indeed because of burning duration cap.
---
You can use [gw2skills.net/editor](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/) to insert any build and find out boon and condition duration in that build.
---
Reminds of my guild leader tbh
---
You just made me buy this cape.
---
They just sell skins . Nothing u get makes u stronger.
---
It is not a card game with uberpowerful card in a lootbox.
---
U do not need them to play
---
50% from balthasar rune; the torch 4 trait also had burning i think so you invest in more condi dmg rather overkill expertise with sinister gear and 100condi dmg food. it is just the power of a single condi set up
---
Monthly fee is not the solution. O would not play this if there was a monthly fee. U will lose more then 5k players  out of the 290k
---
That's not at all what they were saying. You people are psychopaths.
---
People who can hit their benchmarks on bosses outside of Mursaat overseer and the golem.
---
I love being a Power Reaper 😈
---
The trend in the game which I don’t like is the idea that even a shitty pug should clear all instanced content the first time. There is, more and more, this mindset creeping into the game that you shouldn’t need to fail, ever. I would argue that these strike missions are now pretty accessible, and quite successful in that people are regularly pugging them. But without consequence, any content like this will shortly die. Humans thrive on challenge. It should take a few times of trying, figure out the mechanics, have another go at it, finally conquer. If there is some struggle, then the victory has some meaning.
---
I’ve done Boneskinner strike twice now. Once with a random pug, and once with my guild. The pug struggled, lots of death, but we managed it _first time_. With the guild, we absolutely destroyed it. Nothing fancy, no big strategy, just a few random guildies, doing their proper rotations, more or less bunched up on one spot. So no, elites (which we are not) going for gold, not currently nice.
---
sPvP and WvW are submodes of PvP.
---
And at the moment, in PvE, there's only one popular way of playing it, open world, and currently that does not offer a path to legendary armor. What's your point?
---
Kind of to be expected? Weapon swapping has always canceled channels
---
wiki literally says that raid armor is a PvE one, there is no 4th game mode, raids are PvE, just caus eit's not your 111 midles grind doesn't mean it doesn't belong in PvE
---
&gt;For example, getting upset that we haven't seen "expansion level" content yet
---
I'm coming back to the game after playing it during its first two years and then quitting. Someone correct me if I'm totally misremembering, but back at the start didn't Arenanet originally say they weren't going to do big expansions like other MMOs? I distinctly remember that it was kind of a surprise when Heart of Thorns was announced. Or am I wrong about that?
---
But I'm not talking "by definition," I'm talking "what the term actually means to actual people." WvW is considered WvW, even though it is also PvP *and* PvE. sPvP is considered PvP even though it also contains PvE. Raids *contain* PvE content, but are not considered to be "PvE" in the same way *core* PvE is, any more than WvW is considered to be "PvP." There's no benefit to engaging in semantic arguments about "*technically. . ."*
---
There are 4 ways to play PvE by your definition, and 3 of them are popular, dungeons being "dead" even tho it's easy to form groups for them. If you can't form a raid and a fractal static don't blame the game.
---
Possibly 50% of my play time in GW1 was running people around casting VOS. Oh the memories.
---
Capes look nice with certain shoulder pieces. Personally not using one yet as they don't fit any of my chars, but I've already seen some cool looks in DR. 
---
Hopefully some of the future designs will be more complex. Adding less floaty capes would be a great addition too since slimmer armor skins do not need that extra space to avoid clipping.
---
The problem is, there needs to be progression.  This sort of thing is fine.  This current difficulty is okay in Strike missions.  *However* they need to build on it.  There needs to be hard mode variations of these that does up the difficulty a fair bit.  Maybe not outright killing the party for failing a mechanic, but killing them after two failed mechanics instead.  Give it slightly better rewards and call it something other than Challenge Mode and I think we're good.  They need to be somewhere between how difficult Lupi was back in 2013-14 and how difficult the latter end of t3 fractals are.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm really surprised that in such a short time they added a long list of requested features! It's like after years of throwing excuses someone took some responsibility and started actually working. It's a welcome change to say the least!
---
However, what they've added to the game is far from perfect and I'd really like to see them improve it.
---
&gt;There are 4 ways to play PvE by your definition, and 3 of them are popular, dungeons being "dead" even tho it's easy to form groups for them. If you can't form a raid and a fractal static don't blame the game.
---
Being able to form a raid or fractal group does not make them "popular." They still make up a very tiny fraction of time spent in the game. Not even 10% of players have even entered the PoF raids. It is extremely niche, like Stronghold.
---
I'm glad I read far enough to get to this argument. "I don't mean definition, I'm talking about what the word means." If I ever wind up in court for some reason, this is my insanity defense argument.
---
Again, semantics. It is a mode that *involves* PvE gameplay, like WvW and sPvP do, but it is not the primary PvE mode that most PvE players engage in.
---
He means half a guild cape lol....
---
In gw1 guild capes went all the way down ;)
---
You didn’t play gw1 if you think the “guild cape” is comparative
---
They are popular. Maybe not on NA.
---
No one in their right mind would play sPvP and WvW for their PvE aspects. Because... They aren't mainly pve gamemodes.
---
Aight, of course raids aren't like open-world pve, that's why they are 2 separate gamemodes. Both of them are pve tho. What's your point? Do you consider raids as pvp? Instanced pve its still pve.
---
Debating semantics it's a thing but this is something else.
---
&gt;Why aren't they listening when people say that new skins for the wardrobe should be added without them being sold via gem-shop?
---
To be honest they're not adding skins to the gem store, either: how long has it been since we got a skin for the warclaw or the beetle? Or new makeover kit-exclusive hair/beard/accessory pieces?
---
This topic is giving me deja vu.
---
Never said they were the same design. But capes in GW1 was fundamentally a guild feature.
---
Something that irks me, you mentioned that only 10% of the gw2efficency players finished PoF raids, right? Those are the harder raids. The ERP3 teams will confirm that with them failing Quadim 2 many times. Makes sense tho, most mmo players don't enjoy a challenge.  Hell, many wow players wait for the next expansion to do the raids they struggle even a tiny bit with, which is impossible here without a gear threadmill.
---
In general, PvE in mmos refers to Player vs Environment. Your definition of PvE is very subjective and not the popular one, in fact, I don't know a single person who uses the word PvE like you do.
---
Of course I am insisting on using the correct terms when you are talking about something. PvE isn't just open world PvE. If you want to use the wrong terms be my guest but I will say it again: Raids are PvE. 
---
You keep insisting on calling open world PvE just PvE which is wrong. 
---
(Reminder: Discussion started from your statement that there are no PvE legendary armor sets which was false of course)
---
Watch them bring back golem week + portable cannons instead.
---
Hope we get WvW events more often, even if it's just 2x EXP weekends.
---
Game mode is in desperate need of love. And since it seems the balance team is moving things in the right direction, right after the big balance patch tha is coming could be a good opportunity to slot an event, to incentivize players to come back and give it another try.
---
Moreover it is not really needed in WoW, because you can put your spells on the actionbar wherever you want. I've never really understood why GW2 restricts that.
---
I would like a "no mount and gliding" event
---
Seems to me like it does exactly what is says on the tin...
---

Remember, the content guide isn't the large text block, \*\*it's just the rotating arrow\*\*.
---
bullshit. they planned to go with rng only for the others too, but changed their mind, because of feedback.
---
Hey there! Was about to put in a ticket on this. My board is missing for season 4, and I'm still getting the mail for it. HOWEVER to add weirdness to this I have a random dragoncrystal node in my home instance now.
---
And unless he kept up with unlocking them for free it will cost to buy the episodes he's missed out on.
---
Oooh yeah.
---
1. i don't play a lot of PvP so I can't really say but in general people would like it to be more active and it's got a decent amount of toxicity like a lot of online PvP.
---
2. Only in so much as you're expected to own the expansions, without them you'll be at a disadvantage since you won't have access to any elite specializations ("sub classes"). If you buy the expansions ([for $20](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807)) then you'll be at the same point as everyone else as structured PvP makes everyone the same in terms of gear, level, unlocks, etc. At worst you'd need to spend some in game gold to unlock a couple runes or sigils but a brand new level 2 character is on even footing with a level 80 fully geared character (assuming both have the expansions).
---
So free payment ? Like now
---
It's only natural. Even with content updates one should keep in mind GW2 is almost eight years old.
---
Not gonna lie, thought those were condoms at first.
---
Oh yes. How about not invalidating the investment that I made in 15 freaking bag slot expansions to carry around multiple sets of gear, by releasing build loadouts... and then having the gall to charge me again for more loadout slots?
---
Oh okay, thanks. I had gotten little glimpses of all of this through reporting in the gaming press, but I didn't have the full picture. The way people were talking, I had gotten the impression that everyone was left waiting for a full expansion; the fact that Anet announced the shift away from full expansion packs ahead of time makes the situation a little better (although obviously it's not good if people aren't happy with what's coming out).
---
Looking at the state of the game lately and the layoffs at Arenanet, it definitely feels like there was some sort of turmoil going on behind the scenes. Hopefully they can sort out whatever the problem was and get back on track.
---
Oh man, I used to have these in my pencil case in high school.
---
In fact, they still might be there, I still use it to store office supplies in.
---
capes arent essential and 1 cape is obtainable in game for guild commendations.
---
The only problem with is that it split community ans gated outside ppl. Btw u can enjoy game even without shines
---
did you go into the arena instead just standing at the entrance?
---
No warclaw. You haven't gone hard enough.
---
Did you try to close the game and wait a bit? After some time you can't enter a instance again.
---
The same thing happend to me yesterday. The only way to get out witch I found was portal scrolls.
---
Oh.....
---
Yes, you are arguing semantics while I give you the most used definition of PvE.
---
TIL raids, dungeons, story, fractals aren't PvE
---
Use a waypoint.
---
and knowing is half the battle!
---
The game's reward structure has been hobbled by the gem store from launch, that's just the way of it.
---
Not in GW2. Most GW2 players don't even think about raids and such.
---
Then why nobody agrees with you in this comment thread?
---
dont forget to add " a button to instantly max all wvw abilities on fresh characters you want to wvw on, on an account that has enough points to max all abilities ten times over"
---
Just to be clear, you do not OWN anything.
---
You pay to gain access to a service which can be terminated whenever the company so chooses.
---
The only thing you may own is a physical copy of the product.
---
And you are using words wrong. We aren't so different after all.
---
nobody does that consistently though. we just dont have time for it, especially if youre occupied with stuff on screen (fighting, for instance). 
---
ive been in many guilds over the course of gw 2's history and thats one issue that often has been brought up by people in the guilds, the difficulty in knowing who is who if they're on alt characters et cetera. lot of unnecessary confusion, and a lot of remembering character names and/or having to hover over their names constantly.
---
I really like the idea, ive been thinking about it too as a feature. make it an option in settings, and/or guild tab, to show peoples account names instead of character name. or even better, make it so you can just rename people inside the guild roster (or directly from the guild chat) to whatever you want (client side so its only for you) and make it remember that name for as long as the person is in the guild.
---
heck, why not make it so you can do this not just for people in the guild but for anyone on your friends list? i know we can rename people on the friends list right now but sadly changes there does not show up on chats.
---
im no techie but that shouldnt be too hard to do i dont think?
---
So what? Scarfs had the same problem, and they were still implemented.
---
You may have to ask Kormir that one...
---
i didnt think about that, that might be a good idea
---
Because 1) that's how things roll. You basically pay for the ability to use that item many months longer and earlier than someone who buys late. We paid for HoT, now it's free. To paid 180 bucks to be in fashion.   
---
and 2) because Anet made all the money they can from people who would pay 180 bucks for one skin. At this point, that's just not happening anymore because of the starbound griffon skin. But they can make additional money from all the people who would buy it if the one skin was selectable for cheaper.
---
Don't bait OP with s1 and 2
---
I really don't think that was the case. They released them in rng because they felt it wouldn't be a big deal, and it was, the amount of negative feedback and drama back then was one of the largest ones in the gw2 gemstore history. So, for the second one they opted to release a non Rng way to get them, because if they were to release another mount pack locked behind rng, oh boy... Things would be really bad.
---
As for the invalidating the investment, they are right to do so, it would be a major kick in the teeth of people who bought tons of them to get that 1 skin. I personally bought them all overtime with gold, back then I just saw it as a "gold lootbox", but didn't buy a single one with cash.
---
No downed state + golem week + portable siege (not just cannons) + everyone is naked + gates are open + walls can't be damaged + gliding/mounts are disabled + everyone has superspeed + no conditions + no boons + no cc + camp veteran is replaced by killable Legendary Defender + tower/keep bosses are replaced by a random dungeon final boss
---
It's empty  :)
---
I never said we were. Everybody's people.
---
Confirmed, I want to die now

I woldnt say it's quick now. Everyone has it already and you can't catch up to them by walking :D
---
&gt; Everyone is going nuts about the new capes, many people are spending gems and seem to be happy about Anet implementing something new in their game.
---
They are happy about ANet implementing something old in their game (from GW1). But the main point is: "They are happy". That's good.

---
Check out this thread, it helped me. It provides a schedule of profitable open world metas.
---
Also, I recommend for you to do the daily stuff in competitive modes as well. Each daily gives potions that progresses a reward track 0.5 or 1 tick and they can come useful for when you need to get PvP/WvW exclusive skins, a certain new skin from the story quickly, Gift of Battle, Mystic Clovers and extra gold/mats from the reward track.
---
I wouldn't. It would be a week I wouldn't spend in WvW.
---
&gt; no conditions
---
You forgot "no direct damage either", just to be fair.
---
and unintentional. capes are fundamentally a lot like gliders, so it's entirely possible they just copied the code when it came to putting it in the BLT store and just overlooked it.
---
goota stay consistently inconsistent
---
I can tell you their reasoning that adding a select option here is invalid - I would personally feel no remorse and none of my friends who I talked to said the same. If anything I would be happy that people can finally purchase whatever damn mount they want instead of RNG which I think is a bigger outrage than any "hurt feelings" from the whales that bought every single one in hopes of getting the one they wanted.
---
Because you are an idiot for spending that much for RNG, and it's the way business works - early adopters have to pay more and later on you can get the same thing for cheaper.
---
It's probably force of habit tbh. can't say I blame them. It is a bit ignorant to type without knowing what they're typing about though so.. eek.
---
this answer is so retarded, it's like saying WvW is PvP just cause a lot of PvP people play WvW
---
&gt; OP Man, the rest of the styles I've seen looks 'normal / generic' 
---
How is Saitama not generic
---
Yes.
---
Public missions have a few bugs, I heavily discourage from joining them. Open a squad through LFG and wait a bit longer instead.
---
Generic/high uptime boobs - so all of them because boon creep has been insane since POF?
---
Hm, I just did it (literally a couple days ago) as a roaming Warrior (base, not Spellbreaker) and it was pretty damn effortless. Just popped around taking camps and sitting idle in between participation ticks. Think it took me 4-5 days of 1-2 hours a day to get it.
---
Some people like to feel superior
---
Many guild features were locked for expansion owners only after the release of HoT, so this might be related to that, considering there's a basic guild cape as well.
---
Yeah that still happens, thats why I don't use the updrafts if I'm only doing the mission for story progress
---
Best thing to do is to contact the support, but it sounds a little bit like gw2 tries to write on your hard-drive but does not have the permission.
---
DPS meters and logging are perfect for this. A DPS meter is necessary, since just a DPS number in a vaccuum has very little meaning. 
---
For someone who doesn't know what competitive DPS is, 1000 could sound like a perfectly reasonable number. For someone who does know what competitive DPS is, 15,000 might sound really bad to them when it's just the number given in a vaccuum, while it might be a perfectly fine number when buffs/support/mechanics are being failed by other players.
---
Part of improving is seeing how bad you actually are in the beginning. If you don't know you're underperforming or why you're underperforming, you cannot improve.
---
You mean the big balance patch that is coming...2 days ago? D:
---
i think capes finally came because they were actually waiting to release it with some later planned expac, but the expac probably got cancelled and hence they started to implement capes now.
---
And that is why I'm not even attempting to do the achievements from that bit XD it's frustrating enough trying to get it to work in the first place!
---
While true, I was just letting OP know that base game is still useful in many ways. He seemed to think otherwise...
---
Exactly.
---
The thing is if you don't know "what you did wrong" that made you get low dps numbers there is nothing you can do to improve. If you play dh and you don't know that you should do your bursts while enemy is teathered and standing on symbol before killing the boneskinner you will also not know how to do it afterwards.
---
that's just small QoL for an existing feature tied to the implementation of build loadouts.
---
All those stats don't mean anything in a vaccuum though. Personal DPS means nothing without stats like boon uptime. It might make it slightly more complicated, but without them the number is meaningless. Average DPS per spec also means very little, considering some specs can be played both as healer/support or DPS and since DPS is so reliant on the group. It can also give the wrong impression on the multi-role specs.
---
You need to see if you are underperforming and how you are underperforming before you can improve. Without that you simply can't.
---
contact panel QoL should be next, let us add groups, notes, etc
---
That would actually be fucking amazing but will never happen. Sigh.
---
You cant motivate players into doing something they're heavily opposed to. And "casual" in gw2 is an euphemism for refusing to improve. 
---
If you play 1000s of hours while refusing to learn anything you're not casual. You're really hardcore at playing like a noob.
---
This reminds me when so decided to see “what if I jump off the edge” after the final PoF boss fight. Probably the dumbest thing I’ve done and the run back was soooo painful &lt;.&lt;
---
good bot
---
This is a nostalgic feature, it was the same in gw1. You got a disconnect? Do it again!
---
This so much! Im willing to pay for it just like build templates!
---
Now the question is: "Boosted Character"?
---
Casual players: This game sure is fun.
---
Hardcore players: I hate this game and want to quit. Also, we need to find a way to teach these casuals how to enjoy the game like us.
---
Attempt it on a day where the Daily Achievement is "Daily MAP_NAME Event Completer". Much more people.
---
Yes, I'm not disagreeing. But it seems they have something more in mind and this is just a step towards it, by the way they worded what we've seen so far.
---
The nostalgia!!!! Nice find!!
---
Yeah, it's really easy to get now.
---
Or Batman one. When he grabs the cape with both hands and jumps.
---
I am playing a revenant. From my understanding for pve dungeons fractals raid i will be support right?
---
Many groups do not require a healer at all, and chrono cannot provide good boon uptime other than quickness and alacrity.
---
Firebrand and Renegade can provide might, fury, quickness and alacrity while doing significantly more damage than chrono+druid can. 
---
Renegade also has access to the best CC in the game and is the only class that can provide good amounts of stability.
---
from my pug experience, it's actually better, probably because it's easier
---
I'm really surprised no one here has pointed out this is a good thing to stop you wasting money on crap you don't need. The cape doesn't even look good.
---
in a guild, you can just mouse over any name to see the account name O.o
---
How many screens did you have to take to get one where it doesn't clip through your body?
---
It is practically unusable for my chars, it not only clips on slightest movement but on some races clips even when standing still.
---
People hated on OP support Mesmer until Anet killed it, now they got OP support Firebrand. *shrug*
---
Sweet. Are you also going to add those Challenge Modes that were promised? 
---
As an slightly above average player, I would like to enjoy some actually challenging content as well.
---
You know; because we dont play Mario games where Final bowser fight is as easy as first level mushroom am I right?
---
Reminds me how skill signets were still in the game for couple of betas. I saved [illusionary weaponry](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Illusionary_Weaponry) and gave it to a cousin for new playthrough, enough to say he cut through everything to Lion's Arch or so
---
Chrono was there for quickness and skips mostly and had shit dps.
---
It took nerfs, portal skips are now done with consumables, and meanwhile a Firebrand can also keep up permanent swiftness, while also giving out almost every other boon bar alacrity in the game on top of doing respectable dps ( and helping you ignore mechanics with stability, aegis or on demand projectile reflect).
---
Druid was there for might and healing bad groups but did shit dps.
---
Druid nerfs have forced you for a long time to choose between good heals but shit might, or good might but meh heals.
---
Renegade heal and elite provide more than enough sustain for good groups even if the renegade is diviners or zerk. on top of that Renegade and Firebrand can close to maintain 25 might together ( the last 2-3 stacks can come from your weaver or your bannerslave) and the renegade also permanently maintains alacrity.
---
On top of doing okay dps ( and being a legend toolbox. Shiro for dps, but it can be a boon-remove bot with mallyx, stab bot with Jalis, reflect bot with Ventari, etc)
---
So you basically get everything you had with a chrono+druid setup, with the added benefit of your support classes being able to hit 15k+ dps or even 20k+ with practise.
---
Example when I look through my 99 CM log from yesterday @ Enso.
---
Weaver+ Soulbeast ending at 30k+
---
Bannerslave hovering around 25k.
---
Firebrand around 22k.
---
Renegade around 18k.
---
Chrono and druid most likely would have massive trouble to hit above 10k each.
---
For Fractals the most efficient builds would be Heal Renegade and Diviner Renegade, both support yes, for Raids you can also play as Condition DPS.
---
damn this man has no chill
---
And some people just simply dont care and that's why they are casual. (Not saying that's bad)
---
If I remember right you could res him straight after cut scene on every character because there was (is?) revive icon above that stays for like 1-2 seconds.
---
I had the entire set of pins then I moved and can't find them. They are probably around someplace.
---
I also have the skill cards they used for the Gencon 5K sealed deck tournament. Thankfully I know where those are.
---
I feel your pain. This glitch has been "fixed" about three times and it still keeps happening. I had it happen to me during the last updraft phase in the Migraine fight. I made a lot of angry noises that night and then just went to bed. I got the achievement a week later but I was not a happy camper.
---
Having access to permanent alacrity without sacrificing utility or weapon skills is also pretty fuckin OP
---
Yup. Did that. In that bank i cant say i found many that look very good
---
The thing is, there's only so much you can do within the game to help people. That's why this is not a proposal for a dps tutorial, but instead a nudge. Give people some motivation to seek the techniques for themselves. Even something as simple as a better build/loadout would go a long way.
---
Also shatters are awful and nobody want to play chrono anymore
---
Does it though? I remember for me Lupicus was great example of learning how to watch boss animations. Currently GW2 became dance simulator where people try to avoid orange circles.
---
I've been wearing mine with the dolyak shoulders and the cape sits so nicely below the fur from the shoulders. It feels really well done.
---
I don't think a full on dps meter for every person in the strike would be the best option based similarly on what you said. But I still think that if people knew their relative performance, it could serve as a powerful motivator to help them self-improve. This could then help them towards more difficult content. A high degree of difficulty met with a high degree of skill is more enjoyable for most people, even "casuals".
---
If you were not a minority, this game would have shut months after release.
---
Tell me, do you intend to offer your work or make some money with it? 
---
You walk into a restaurant, had a blast with the food quality, in the end the waitress tells you the price is what you think they deserve.... are you the kind of person who leaves bragging how you got free meal?
---
You are a fucking donkey.
---
At least this time there was not. Thats why I thought about trying the feedback. You know, story is difficult so I wanted extra hand to help with the bugs.
---
I think they look nice [My thief with the new cape and dagger](https://i.imgur.com/3bBBlFF.jpg)
---
I too made a lot of angry noises, and walked around the room for a bit until I tried again and did it whilst crying in anger
---
pug is not meta
---
using script wont make you get detected or macro i guess , so reporting those are crucial
---
Least I'm not a Cthulhu.
---
Solo healing can get tricky though IF noone ever dodges/moves. But staying stacked is also important. Maybe add a mathias type of mechanic with player sacrifice, add 5mil health.
---
most people buy useless cosmetics because they enjoy the game and they want to support anet
---
they enjoy the content so they buy skins to keep the quality content coming
---
if anet stop giving us good quality content people won't buy anymore shit they sell on gemstore, this is an "action" mmorpg, not a dressing or fashion game...
---
At least the reward is proportional to the current difficulty!
---
&gt; as massive heals
---
Druid never had massive heals, never
---
I think it was an "on the table" mention, but never promised. Some people just like to pull things directly out of their ass.
---
Good luck seeing 90% of the tells when fighting bosses with 10 people is basically just visual cancer on the boss.  I wish you could turn off other players effects like you can in games like FFXIV.  Makes it much much much easier to see the boss.
---
I think there are people that dont care because they just want to do their own thing and run around with their character the way they want to play, but I also think there are people that legitimately don't know how they are performing relative to others. The game doesn't have anything in-game to show that except a DPS golem, but even that is somewhat of an out-of-the way thing for most people. If they had some in-game performance feedback it could nudge them towards looking in to how to play better. I'm not trying to be elitist about this, but there's a way to be a "better" gamer which can lead to a more enjoyable game.
---
What huge nerf?
---
Scourge was always to strong. Then got overbuffed October 01, 2019 to 10 targets.
---
Now its back to 5 Targets and a minor nerf to scepter.
---
Its basically at the exact same powerlevel it was pre October 01, 2019.
---
That’s sort of my point, genius
---
In seriousness, wvw events are like pve festivals.
---
You get a week where actual combat goes out the window entirely - which is impressive because the level hasn't exactly been high lately.
---
Instead you get treated to the wvw version of lab farm. Frankly the skill level of certain pve players in wvw is similar to skeletons in lab. Auto it a few times and it gives you a lootbag.
---
No thought whatsoever. Just brainlessly walks at stuff, dies, gives loot and respawn or is replaced by another player likely to do the exact same.
---
I'd like to see a no mounts no gliding event. Hell I'd like to see it along with boosted exp and magic find. After all loot attracts skrit, death repels skrit. Would be interesting to see which one wins out by the end of the week.
---
You may laugh, but it is still the hardest pve content in the game :)
---
He said efficient
---
👍 my whole gameplay changed when I started raiding. 
---
I remember when VG first came out and how I simply  didnt have a clue about much. But with the right people around to help, I grew so much as a player.
---
This was one of the best additions in the new map IMO. The ice shards are so generously available, it makes farming LS4 currencies much faster than the actual LS4 maps.
---
Well, strike missions with the difficulty level of raids for elite players is pretty pointless, too. Because they can simply do their raids.
---
When you're giving quickness you use different runes. On the pure dps variant you'd overcap burn duration with full viper, hence the different pieces.
---
based on your key bindings, are you left handed?
---
That used to be possible but afaik its not anymore.
---
He said "Pug meta", not (speedrun) "meta". The best composition for pugs is different than the best composition for speedruns. SHOCKING isnt it?
---
Also: they probably eu players that don't understand a 0heal lfg in na takes 20 minutes to fill.
---
You can miss out of skyscale and not be hurting too badly, but with the recent endurance change, I would suggest going for the beetle. It's a game changer now.
---
Actually full meta varies depending encounter and some don't even bring qb at all
---
No, you are.
---
Ok 10 yo kid calm down
---
Yeah, between CC and decent DPS, he's easily doable. I took him on a few days ago with four other random players, me on condi firebrand. The others were a staff tempest healer, a renegade using shortbow who was clocking 13k DPS on my meter, and a warrior using axe/axe and mace/mace (which can put out a scary amount of CC). I'm not certain exactly how they were all built, but we had both good CC and good DPS, and he went down pretty easily.
---
&gt; The content and the playerbase follow the same trend.
---
Makes sense considering the game is buy to play. No real incentive in pushing a hardcore fanbase to log in daily if you already got their money.
---
Considering GW2's content and gem store releases, I'd bet the majority of gem sales come from casual people who buy skins. Hardcore players are able to farm gold and/or demand in-game rewards, which is a no-no.
---
(ᴗ ͜ʖ ᴗ)
---
Didn't know about this command, so cool
---
But I didn't get stuck, I got thrown up so high by the boss/updraft I left map boundaries and it made me do the whole mission again
---
pug is pug meta
---
You are not getting what I’m saying.
---
You got raids for the hard core. Strike missions for you average joe. Then open world and story for new player. 
---
And I’m saying that strike mission is as the same lvl as for the new players, hence they missed the mark, hence they made it too easy.
---
quickbrand and rene can skip skulls on arta with pug. its just better and faster and EASIER :D  druid is wasted slot,he doesnt bring anything and if you need heals,you dont play meta anyway. rene can solo anomaly and bring HUGE dps increase for whole PT,also 100% ala uptime isnt bad too.
---
Ah well. Your personal Scrubby is now in Robot heaven.
---
So this game is still playable
---
Easy choice. They're incompetent. 
---
There is a reason a large part of their studio got fired and it wasnt recordbreaking profits. 
---
There is a reason the design of templates was a shitshow... and it wasnt competence.
---
There is a reason we wont be seeing new expansions or large investments to grow the game. 
---
Would you say the addition of stronghold was anet having a better read of the market or anet being incompetent?
---
A warrior with a rifle... awesome!
---
That's a whole different level of casual lol.. less than 50 hours a year. Like 1 month of the year you spent an hour a day on GW. I wouldn't expect to have anything either :P
---
Eh, no, it is much, much easier to play a proper fb now, than druidless groups before. Boons are far easier to pull off, sustain is huge, gameplay are simplier. Power fb and rene is  a solid norm for mid level groups, that wouldn't try hard druidless runs before.
---
And people who play hfb shouldn't really be mentioned in the context of dps anyway. If those can be compared to anything, it is 4 scourges 1 druid groups.
---
Ofc it is better ... still in a good grp phases we’re super short in a old fashioned comp
---
I want an easier way to see if I have revealed!!  Like I want it freaking obvious when I can attempt to stealth again.  So much of the game revolves around looking for animations, but I'm constantly having to focus on my buff bar to see if I have revealed.  I have started counting in my head after I stealth attack which works better, but the game should do this for me.
---
Ye heal fb is just wasted potential
---
Thanks for assuring me you are a 10 yo kid
---
You've played for like 5 hours, at least finish leveling to 80 and most of these questions will be answered for you as you learn the game.
---
And like the other person said.. If you really 'cant find any cool armor' in there then maybe you just don't like the style for this game. There are a ton of cool sets (and a ton of average looking pieces to be fair, maybe you just saw those). Check out [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Human\_male\_heavy\_armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Human_male_heavy_armor) for a few. The BIGGEST thing to remember: YOU CAN DYE EVERY PIECE OF GEAR whatever colors you want. And most pieces have multiple spots to dye different colors. That alone turns one 'armor set' into many many options, and if you want to combine armor sets then you get even more options.
---
Woosh
---
So basically you want the game to play itself for casuals?
---
if you played 11 hours a day like this guy did it might take a little fewer days
---
I'm a new player as well. I just finished PoF and started LW4, any recommendations?
---
&gt; A pure DPS meter, especially one that shows the dps of everyone in the group could throw a LOT of people off because let´s be honest: 90% of the time this will only lead to accusations, not usefull advice.
---
Here's an example of a solution to this: after the fight, show a dps table with just you and the top dps player. This accomplishes the following:
---
- Allows the player to put their performance in perspective by showing them what it COULD BE. If they see their dps being 2k, when the top dps has 25k, that allows them to see just how much they are underperforming, and, hopefully, make appropriate conclusions.
---
- By not showing the performance of the rest of the squad, it avoids the, lets's call it, "downward" toxicity - accusations of bad performance from better-performing players. But it still retains the risk of "upwards" toxicity - complaints about tryharding, cheating etc. But I imagine that for people on top of the dps ladder, such accusations of "being too good" would only stroke their ego (they sure would mine), so I don't view this as a negative.
---
- Lets poorly performing players know who they can try contacting for advice or training. It would be on their own terms, not forced, but at least they would know who their ~~role~~ performance model should be.
---
- To avoid concerns about outliers, maybe not 1 but 2-3 top dps players could be shown. That opens doors to toxicity among them, though.
---
Sadly, healing and boon support can hardly be measured this way, but luckily they aren't as pressing of an issue that needs addressing as dps (and, by extension, general understanding of how to play the class and the game) is.
---
They call those raids.  You might be interested in them.
---
this is a very good argument! whatever pugs run becomes meta!
---
so, do you feel the standard meta composition of 3 power scourge 1 condi scrapper 1 minstrel druid synergizes well? would you run it over the alternative meta of 4 condi deadeyes 1 heal chrono?
---
Ok cool I had a feeling I could coast with what I’m getting so far but good to know. Regarding gold is crafting outright the best money making strat or are raids/dungeons a good idea in regards to that. I just got 80 the other day and I only have 18 gold which I feel is a paltry amount for where I should be. But I also don’t know any better
---
gl finding someone whos gona actualy do that in 250kp group! we had today qb with 50% quickness uptime and we had to tell him which traits to swap... so ye.
---
why are you so surprised the meta changed after 2 years? it's hardly "a bit"
---
as an aside, why park characters at jp chests? is there a potential drop there that's valuable?
---
The difference is that wells suck unless you have a guarantee that people are going to stand in them for their full duration.  Quickness mantras &amp; Alacrity "aura" are so much more consistent and reliable upkeep methods because you don't have to take a nap while you're waiting for boons.  They're on you, they can move "with" you and are more frequently applied.  
---
Instantaneous boon-application is incomparable to Chrono.  Getting good up-times on Chrono these days is less dependent on being a "good Chrono" and more on your team's positioning; whereas Firebrigade can freely adapt to changes in positioning, mechanics and "force-feed" players boons.  Delayed Quickness/Alacrity vs. aRPG combat system.  Chrono wells have not aged well for Fractals that require lots of movement or dodging.  
---
You might "think" it's okay, but I'd really encourage you to open up Arc and look at boon uptimes.  Alacrity usually drops down to like 30-40% unless it's a stationary boss; whereas w/ an Alacragade it's usually 90-100% easily.  Losing 50-60% uptime because you can't force-feed your wells to players in practical combat is awful.  Chrono is great if you can play GW2 in a vacuum, but an aRPG combat system is anything but a vacuum.  It's erratic, volatile and inconsistent.
---
See, my suspicion is that anyone really interested in boon uptime is already running arcDPS to track that and other stuff in fine grained detail.
---
Here, we're just talking about inspiring a bit of curiosity or personal incentive/motivation for those who don't run arc to begin to compare their own personal performance against themselves, without the pressure of comparing themselves against others.
---
The average dps per spec as proposed would definitely be a -low- average, based on as you say, variations in spec. Point is to at least encourage more players to begin matching that low average. As more do, that average goes up over time.
---
By at least showing those personal stats to the individual, it may eventually prompt questions like "how come in some groups my DPS is much higher than in other groups" (aka boons) or "how do I change how I play to at least match that average?"
---
We're talking about players who don't even -know- that they are underperforming. I don't think more complicated data will help until the motivation is there - at which point there's always arc, but we can agree to disagree.
---
They weren't, they were datamined.
---
I'm getting the same error frequently, as others have described. It's annoying because it pops up so often.
---
I was in a group that wiped to boneskinner yesterday. They were all spread out all over the place and half of them seemed to be AFK attacking the boss. I was so embarrassed I had to log off.
---
&gt; as an endgame/"hardcore" PvE player it's difficult not to feel neglected. 
---
*Laughs in WvW*
---
Only if the rewards are tuned up as well.
---
In fact this is not entirely true. Regular CC attacks do very little to erode his break at. If that’s all you’ve been doing you’re contributing very little. It’s all about getting the appropriate buff maxed before coming to the fight, as that’s what really brings it down.
---
I did this with the rez elixir from the engi :D
---
Oh dear. You've been a very naughty boy, haven't you? Have a downvote.
---
This.
---
When people talk about "casual" in context of gw2, they mean a specific type of player who is stubborn.
---
Real-life casuals don't complain because they're not invested enough to give a shit. They just play the game for fun. And if they lose, they simply try again.
---
Killing Siax before berserk runs out.. xD
---
Its nothing new. Incompetence all the way through.
---
CoR not working on uneven terrain has been a feature since rev released. A great meme considering cor was busted in wvw on hot release... yet doesnt register when fighting near elevation. Wouldn't it be great to add such a skill at the same time we make all wvw borders entirely vertical, and then never adress it?
---
Remember when they added devouring darkness, another disgustingly busted skill?  No los restriction, goes off even if target dodges it, ... takes them months to fix basic functionality and years to fix balance.
---
They're so incompetent I'm actually proud of them when they nerf a skill that should have NEVER been added considering the state necro was in... a year after the fact. Cause if not for cmc they still wouldn't.
---
Tl dr : anet is incompetent :).
---
I like new content and I don't mind difficult content but most importantly I think the rewards should be worth the effort. So bring on the harder stuff but only if the rewards are there.
---
&gt;A Way to Motivate Casual Players to Improve
---
that's funny, tell another one!
---
No offense, but I kind of wish I could have watched how everyone on the boneskinner design team reacted when they saw people playing the live version.
---
These have likely been in development for a while. It's not been a full year since there was a clearing out of old talent and it seems it was for the best. Now I see they're hiring some new artists. Still don't like getting nickle and dimed over templates but I'm glad to see they're listening to the players. If they want our money they should. Maybe they'll listen to us wanting a new expac already.
---
Whatever pugs run is pug meta indeed.
---
"Pug meta" is alacren+healbrand+bs+any 2 dps, not whatever nonsense you wrote.
---
Speed meta varies PER BOSS and it's not 5 meta classes from dt site.
---
I truly appreciate the work you put into this masterpiece.
---
I don't have either of those and passed 6k hours earlier this year...
---
&gt; Why does everyone have to be carried through the game.
---
because making easier game means earning more money and it's the only thing anet cares about
---
Are we talking random or organized? If random, why would you be embarrassed? Spreading out to do torches was everyone's natural reaction when I did it within half hour of release. There's nothing stupid about that unless you know there's a dedicated healer in group or damage mitigation of some sort that allows everyone to sit in mid and spank it.
---
Yeah i run in 100 ess groups. 250 takes too long to fill, and nothing guarantees me the 250 ess people can actually play 0 heals. Replacing a person is also adictonal time.
---
I much rather ask for 100 ess and run alacren+HB and 2dps+bs / 3 dps and can literally finish observatory before filling a pseudo-meta group.
---
Yeah, those are called raids.  You do know that max rewards in a strike is 1 unidentified yellow (and some blues and greens, who cares).  How is that worth requiring heals, good might, and alacrity/quickness?
---
I leave all my unplayed characters at the end of jp to collect loot effortlessly. At some chests, like the Cubular Falls and Skipping Stones ones, I have gotten lode stones, T6 mats, etc. I'm not playing with them at the moment, so I am passively working toward my next legendary, even though I have no idea what it is just yet.
---
Haha so much of this bro.
---
Who knows.. i personally belive they ruined the franchise with the attitude shown this past 2/3 years
---
I know if gw3 is released i wouldn't buy it, can't trust anet to deliver quality content or enjoyable gameplay anymore
---
I'm pretty sure they aren't working on it currently, but who knows they might start in 2020.
---
[Screaming Internally]
---
Druid was there for might and spirits. Heals were only a bonus.
---
you dumb sheeple can disagree all you want, doesnt change that it is new.
---
fractals are not new content, raids are not new, an ew pvp map isnt something new, etc. there is simply nothing truely new they can make.
---
&gt;Are we talking random or organized?
---
Random, pretty clear they'd never done the fight before.
---
&gt;why would you be embarrassed?
---
Cause it's not hard
---
It was basically us excited to see it out and watching people playing it. We very quickly were dissecting where things could be improved and trying to identify all the areas where it wasn't performing as intended. That leads to a quick pow wow of an assessment on all the things we identified as well as purposed solutions. Those solutions are vetted and we immediately take action.
---
Absolutely it's a L2P issue (I'm working towards it myself)I'm just saying it's much easier to focus on DPS and mechanics if you aren't as skilled than to dodge everything flawlessly while pumping out a 50k burst. It's the safer route by a long shot for pugs and randoms. I'm sure most CM parties could run no HB but it would be a lot slower than most runs currently, which negates the speed runs that you can achieve.
---
I would love to see my stats after any piece of content. Similar to pvp stats Id want to know my stats in fractals etc
---
I am! It will actually be in EU, and I need to hurry up and post that... xD
---
Squad up and call everyone. In all my runs everyone joined as soon as i called. As a healer if i have no squad, i can literally save no one.
---
Huh, that sounds like a good plan. I've got a ton of toons doing nothing. Whats the best JP for this?
---
I believe a 32 bag slot recipe, 24 slot bag, a handful of consumables, an exotic weapon, a guild decoration, a BAMF norn helm, a chance to drop a container to choose from 16 weapon skins or 25 map material, a chance at a rare , blues, greens, and currency, and a handful of other things are a good set of rewards.
---
We are working on getting this fix out ASAP. With it will be build notes. :)
---
That's the plan!
---
I like how pve has gotten more competitive in this game than pvp.
---
I’m OK with it. It’s good to have an ez mode mixed in
---
That's a lot of points to try and excuse poor design...
---
Not planing on buying any capes, also don't care much about fashion wars. Just want my characters to not look ridiculous.
---
&gt; don't complain about it...
---
ok white knight
---
Glad it matches the difficulty
---
Animated tells that are not rendered because "low" setting decides they're unimportant. Hell, even telegraphs are half-assed in many situations because colors blend so poorly and showing me that someone put down a damage well or ice field is somehow more important than enemy field which will one-shot me. Lovely.
---
I didnt even notice the torches and my group burned it down in a min
---
None of these rewards are tied to the strike missions.
---
I was thinking factions. You may be correct.
---
In general I think the rewards are fine, but they are just ''fine''. My problem is that after having finished the weapon collection outside strikes I now enter the place knowing exactly what I'm going to get. A single drop exclusive to strikes would already get some excitement and a rare chance to find the 24 and 28 slot bags would already make it feel better long term. 
---
I personally think a miniature of every strike boss with a relatively good droprate (10%?) could fit the strike exclusive droptable. It's not something everyone is really going to like but it would give a little incentive to get in there and be excited for the boss to rotate back in if you happen to miss the miniature of that boss.
---
&gt; incompetent
---
Absolute agree on that, their upper management, marketing and community management were always the worst in the industry from what i could see.
---
They **had** great devs but most of them are gone to amazon and co who are paying. them way better now
---
They are all tied as you need etrite ingots to craft the T2 weapons. Getting more T2 weapons, gets you those rewards. You could go around the OW and gather some, but to be the most efficient, you'll need them from the strikes as well.
---
The title you're thinking of is The Golden Child
---
Chrono boon builds were thoroughly destroyed, no self-shatter destroyed pre-boons. New "everything does +300% damage" instabilities discourages "here, stand in this well to get boon when well ends" (versus 600 AOE boon application via signet). Basically boon Chrono sux extremely hard in fractals compared to FB+alacrigate, both of which do AOE boons. 
---
Healing on druids was nerfed thanks to PvP nerfs, radius of effect from spirits was destroyed, and dismal DPS from pets was nerfed even harder (it's like Anet has weird obsessions) so non-druid healers are now way better and have more utility.
---
You can still get druids, but for more organized groups revenant is preferred by high margin. Or a heal firebrand.
---
Did you forget that the antagonist of PoF was Balthazar? And in s3 it was all humans? And the first half of s4 was Joko?
---
The worst part of "a Voice in the Dark," is realizing that you've become **the Voice in the Dark** in your *Discord* server as fewer and fewer players login to play the content.  The whole, "Icebrood Saga," thing isn't working for my friends.  People login mildly excited, play the content for anywhere from 2-3 to 3-4 days and spread out across the gaming ecosystem. 
---
Once [\[Conqueror's of the Atlas\]](https://www.pathofexile.com/) releases next weekend I'm not anticipating playing much GW2.  In the past I might have felt bad about it, but I'm more excited about having a new challenge league in Path of Exile.  I think ArenaNet is doing okay, but short of a 3rd expansion the "Icebrood Saga" or the "Living Story" hasn't really lived up to my expectations yet.  
---
They've done a good job surprising players with new features and quality of life (Dynamic UI, Capes, Strike Missions).  However, they haven't really done much to appeal to endgame players, and I'm starting to seek an endgame experience elsewhere.  They haven't really added anything for the instanced endgame horizontal progression and I'm craving new experiences and variation that ArenaNet just isn't satisfying.  I don't bear them any ill-will over it, but ???
---
Sadly once you crafted the weapons and don't care about the 32 slot bags, there is barely any incentive to go farm them anymore.
---
weak bait
---
imagine sinking this much time into a dead game
---
First one wasn't all too bad, for a casual target group that is, but yeah 2nd was a bit disappointing and 3rd is a dps golem all over again...
---
I'll chime in on the gearing. Basically you only need ascended gear for fractals, exotics are 100% fine for *everything else*. Exotic gear cost about 30g at most for a full set with trinkets. The easiest way to obtain most of your ascended armor/weapons will be to craft it at approx 30-50g each. For a reference point it's about 20-25g/h farming but you will want your trinkets first. Trinkets are gotten multiple ways, mostly from vendors. Core tyria stats will be from guild commendations, pristine relics, collections, laurels (dont use laurels if possible) or crafting (backpack). That's going to be your main damage boost (around 8-10%) and a large chunk of your Agony Resistance for fractals (why you need ascended) other stats will be easiest gotten from Bloodstone Fen and Shiverpeaks (both a LS episode) but multiple ways of obtaining them through normal ways like trade contracts. Weapon and armor boxes can drop (very rarely) from Tequatl, Triple Trouble (both world bosses) fractals above T1 and raids. They are ridiculously rare in PvP WvW and JP and other sources
---
I don't like the no downstate events but I'd rather have that than mount stomp, but no reason to have either.
---
it's boring especially wifth anet's rather flat story telling. after war eternal i was hoping they would take the opportunity they had given themselves to explore something completely new. no dragons, no nostalgia milking. i think in part i wanted that because i would have taken it as a clearer sign that they are still investing into the franchise.
---
I got all the restored weapons done in the first 3 days without doing the strike missions. You can just send all your alts through the maze and you get 2 bars of etrite each time every day. You can also salvage your restored weapons for more etrite bars which works fine cause their just exotics and you end up getting other mats when you salvage them. The best thing with that whole situation was selling the restored weapons on the TP after I had unlocked the Master of Spirits title. People were paying insane amounts for what will most assuredly be junk exotics in the future.
---
[Cool.](https://media.giphy.com/media/NvgkEvycaWhPi/giphy.gif)
---
same here too tried to connect multiple characters on different accounts same thing
---
So true. I log into the end of the meta once a day now to open chests and do a strike mission just cause I want to have a stack of ingots in case it's needed in the future and then I just log off and wait for the next LS or Wintersday.
---
Still not fixed.
---
i do CMs t4s and recs with 100ess pugs every day for 2 months now and always have a healbrand, not once has anyone bitched about HB not being meta. the only time i do no HB runs is with my full static and good instabs bc not everyone is quite there yet
---
I dont mind it at all, mainly cus, hek, I love dragons. Tho imo with Jormag they so far are hitting a great spot objectively, they have a proper personality and unique features, with good development they could easily be the best villian we had yet, even if they are a dragon.
---
Thing is, the squad really should be formed automatically.
---
Beacuse it's the most effective setup for pugs. Some dimwits here are salty or something and get all defensive when u say it's Pug meta, they think the meta is 0heal (inb4 you don't even use firebrand in many bosses for true meta records )
---
Zhaitan and Mordremoth were meh in my opinion. Kralkatorrik was a little more interesting.
---
Honestly, not my favorite. I think it would have been fun if the Joko or White Mantle threats were more fleshed out.
---
&gt; And in s3 it was all humans?
---
Episode 1: Humans
---
Episode 2: Primordus' twisted Destroyers in Ember Bay.
---
Episode 3: Jormag's Sons of Svanir and Icebrood
---
Episode 4: Humans
---
Episode 5: Draconis Mons had "Lazarus", Mercenaries, Inquest and the Wildlife of the map.
---
Episode 6: A wee bit of humans at start, rest was Siren's Landing with a Risen, a few of Balthazar's Mercenaries and the real Lazarus at the end.
---
Personally, I enjoy the dragons. I liked the initial idea of them being forces of nature that are impossible to stop, like trying to stop the sun from rising or trying to prevent a rainstorm. I loved running around GW1 and seeing Kralkatorrik sleeping, or seeing "Jormag" (who ended up being Drakkar instead) and theorizing what it would be like to eventually fight against them. I also loved pouring over Kekai Kotaki's concept art and trying to figure out what design would be best suited for each dragon.
---
I think most of my excitement with the dragons comes from seeing the released design of the dragon and seeing them animated on screen, and whatever lore that comes with them. Gameplay-wise they are certainly hit or miss with me (especially Zhaitan, as it is with most people) but I do really enjoy them otherwise.
---
That said, I pretty much just like the lore of GW as a whole, so if the story beat went away from the ED's I wouldn't be up in arms about it. If not the dragons, I would love to learn more about the old Gods that existed before the Six came to Tyria, specifically the Arachnid Gods.
---
exhibit a of why devs dont talk to fans lol
---
I like this idea. I think it would also be helpful if the game gave some kind of instruction help towards proper gear, builds, and rotations. They have something similar with PvP where it would have 'default' build options that people could run with. While they are not perfectly optimized (and perfect optimization will always change) it would be good enough and better than what most are doing.
---
well,from time to time i join 500/600 kp groups and those are definetly speedruns,but ye if you dont wana wait half hour for qb/500 kp and save 5 mins,hfb is your best choice.
---
Oh... oh.... I have to say I feel bad for this guy. Never swapping attunement, never dodging the slam, not even with fire 4, spamming heal while at full hp. Oh boy. This is what I mean. He got sp far into the game and he has no clue what his buttons do. At least he has the glyph trait.
---
Yes it is possible. Difficulty settings.
---
Pres esc
---
&gt; ok white knight
---
Oh, you are just a troll kiddy, I see.
---
Joko was the best dragon.
---
I love it, dragons are great. I'm glad Kralk had a kind of grandfather/granddaughter relationship with Aurene and that Jormag is being designed in a more subtle way though.
---
All they need is to say anything and people would be happy.
---
What about conditions?
---
I don't really care who the antagonist is as long the plot isn't a simple smash and bash. A plot folding into somewhat twisted and complicated story is what I really like. I hope Jormag will deliver that. Initially I hoped that Bangar would be a somewhat reluctant anti-hero instead of a full fledged villain.
---
Check that you're plugged im and your battery/performance profile isn't set to either power-saver or balanced and is on high performance.
---
Thank you! 😁
---
Yeah, forgot thoose, I'd either go into a 4th line or somewhere else for better visibility.
---
I think they are interesting in the way they are unique from each other and represent certain aspects of nature / the world. Very different take from the classic Smaug-esque treasure dragon.
---
I don't find it compelling needing to kill them all though. I'm still not entirely sure what the narrative for that is other than "we need big bad guy".
---
I didn’t mind it at the beginning, but it has dragged on for a long time now to the point where it can get tiring. Completely agree about the GW1 antagonists and factions being very good. 
---
Can’t really speak to PoF since I’ve mostly disengaged from the game since about halfway between HoT &amp; PoF (build template &amp; WvW reasons). 
---
For some reason, the warring factions in GW1 seemed more believable and interesting with actual belief systems. In GW2, it seems like most of the main enemies you fight are just non-sentient creatures, or things that are under mind-control from Mordremoth. Or zombified mobs of Kralk or Zhaitan. 
---
The interesting antagonists with belief systems like the Nightmare Court were mostly side-stories. The times where those factions rose above side-story status were the more interesting parts of GW2. Maybe they will get back to that with the Sons of Svanir, but even that group seems a bit simplistic with “me want power” motivations.
---
The good ol' days when weapons didn't determine your skills.
---
yeah, really fast fixes
---
Make your own guild with a white background so it blends into the cape
---
Crafting is a gold sink(unless you are a trading post baron), but if you are interested in getting ascended armor at some point, it's the only reliable way to get it outside of raids.  Raids are good for getting ascended gear, but have a relatively high barrier to get into.  Best way is to join a training guild.  Last I checked the best gold farm is playing Dragonfall from the previous LS.  High level fractals are another good income source, but require ascended gear to get to the good rewards.
---
Just checked it out. I am loving the fact you can have you UI only show during combat!
---
Meh, honestly records recently have become insanely frequent compared to 2k16-2k18, esp. in fractals sN caused a lot of fresh air
---
It's the text from a core story step for Charr. No idea how the player was able to broadcast it.
---
Ye, tho rn its extremely hard to kill, its not just case of "bring a healer" you need to have at least 2 and even then its hard to get below 70% Might need few hours of attempts
---
He's doing a good job of responding to be fair to him. It's a little sad to see the tone of the community toward him. A shame fkr all parties that we shave reached this point
---
r/guildrecruitment is your best friend. Stay away from 100% rep guilds. If you aren't fully committed to WvW dont worry about servers (lots of people will pay for transfer + you get free transfer with game purchase) find one that fits you.
---
Depends on the class. Some are pretty straight forward to what you should be doing, but others have long arbitrarily complicated 50 step lists for optimal dps and I really don't blame anyone for not having the time or patience to learn that. Like a daredevil, Tempest, DH can probably get within 80% of benchmark just by playing what feels right, but if you try to do that on weaver you probably won't hit 50%.
---
The 1/10 is obviously EVE, since you can't jump in circles around other players.
---
And this is also the main reason GW1 isn't considered an MMO. Not being able to jump at all makes it impossible to socialize.
---
As long as strikes get people wanting more perhaps it will guide non Raiders into Raid. A Iron Legion can only hope.
---
- The lead up to Zhaitan was awesome, the fight itself, not so much.
---
- The lead up to Mordremoth was decent, the fight itself was interesting!
---
- ~~Balthazar &amp; Joko~~

- Kralkatorrik was excellent in most ways, the lead up felt quite dire in the moment, and on replaying later still feels great, the fight was cinematic, and the final map's execution gave a better tie in than Dragon's Stand.
---
- Jormag feels like an interesting villain. I wonder where they will take it, and if it can live up to their current mysterious nature.
---
I found Joko fun, but ultimately not that threatening. A little too Disney for me. Balthazar' needer a lot more justification than we were given. And I don't think we'll get any of it anymore. He felt quite petty, his final stand was pretty sweet though.
---
Good players didn't run druid
---
please not that one thaha. more dps mess whoo. but yeah any kind of event would be at least something.
---
I'm personally expecting Etrite ingots to get more use in future releases on the map too, honestly. Would be nice if they got some kind of long term use thereafter (used in a recipe for some kind of sharpening stone, or convertible to some other currency) but Anet doesn't have a great track record with recycling older materials into useful ones.
---
I'm kind of treating them like dungeon tokens right now - good for the set of skins you want and otherwise not that useful.
---
I've made more friends in my recent WvW guild than any PvE guild I've ever been a part of.  We aren't 100% rep or very serious about WvW.  Just for fun.  We do PvE stuff as well.  Look for one of those.
---
Just get experienced support to carry the Strike Mission and it's fine honestly, I feel you're getting a bit overly dramattic over this. However if this can mean you (and others) get to think a bit more about team composition, your build/rotation/dps then I think it's a pretty welcome sight!
---
That could just be due to the RNG on getting players that don’t kill themselves
---
Does he still proc retaliation a hundred times a second? Because those were some tasty damage numbers.
---
There should be one of these events every single month of the year imo (like not WvW bonus every month. But rotate with world bosses, champ trains, etc). It should run alongside whatever festival or Living World release is on at the time. Problem is ANET burned people out by doing back to back weeklong events with nothing else to do. And that is actually what they stated the whole point of these events was... to be literally filler content. 
---
&gt; [Our intention is to run these during times when there are no major releases, and reward players for participating.](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/75132/upcoming-bonus-events)
---
But I don't think they should be used only when there's no festival and no living world release on the horizon.
---
Every line of text in the game has an id, if you put it in a chat link, it will appear like that.
---
This post didn't age well
---
It's great!!!
---
Just managed to kill it in 3 tries with pugs.
---
* You need 1-2 people whose job is to lit torches, thieves or any build with blinks/leaps works well.
---
* If nobody does this, Boneskinner will destroy them by hitting them a second time.
---
* Epidemic is good on the mobs, or any AOE pull. They aren't too dangerous so reflects can work too.
---
* Now you actually have to be careful and not stack in the circles, it'll down a lot of players who aren't paying attention or dodging properly. Positioning has become important in this fight.
---
I'm very excited, liked it a lot, and hope there is more of this to come.
---
You're awesome Clayton and i wanna hug you. ok bye!
---
Nevermind then
---
Well to be fair they said it would be possible with, not impossible without. There's a difference :P
---
I suppose the weaver/scourge meta has distorted my view. Records were tossed around like nothing at that point
---
I like it much more now.
---
It not just a braindead afk auto dps golem anymore.
---
You actually need to put some effort and maybe some heal, at least with pugs.
---
all of them have allready dropped with more than half, and will soon be a few gold each.
---
You have discovered the true ending for the encounter.
---
Just done it now wiped 2 times and just switched to heal necro and heal brand and we done it decently well.
---
Group just need to watch for torched and actuly dodge attacks.
---
You go to starting areas, slowly approach someone, follow them all over the place for a while, and if they turn to face you or talk to you - and only if they do that - you tell them "Do you like movies about gladiators?".
---
The buttons are hard to push
---
\&gt; ANET realizing that attempting to please both crowds won't work so they just turn Strike Missions into bite-sized raids
---
I'm glad.
---
There's room for something between strike difficulty and raid difficulty.  Strikes you can flub your way through and clear for reduced rewards, but raids are a clear/no clear situation.  VG for example is more mechanically intense than any current strike, but his mechanics are learnable.  But you also need the dps, and if you're trying to start a raid group from scratch you need both.  But getting a typical open world player to fix their build is hard and takes time, and learning mechanics takes time.  In the mean time, youre beating your head against a brick wall with no reward.  A more mechanically intensive strike that uses timers to grant bonus rewards without an enrage would be a good way to bridge the gap.  Give players a chance to learn the fight for mediocre rewards, then truly reward those who can clear in the proper time.
---
Well, yea, so basically just like SC and qT back then, except with 10 times more records nowadays. I guess 2k18 was also alright records wise, 2k16 and 17 really had barely any records if you compare it to nowadays. And well, frac records were basically nonexistent lmao
---
Think so, but the buffs one is all over the place and buffs like spotter get lost in more meaningless buffs such as consumables or passive things
---
It's not really a difficult benchmark to reach, now is it?
---
Be friendly, talk to people!
---
But that is a shoulder piece. The cape would have to go over the scarf. The thicker scarf all other shoulder pieces. Small ones. Huge norn shoulders. 
---
The other option would be that the cape goes under the shoulders. That would look stupid. 
---
Or they attach it at the back. The easy and better looking option.
---
I started playing GW2 when I was living in NA but I'm back in Europe now and never bothered to switch regions back. I might use this as the final push to get me to switch back. Would you say you do more NA trains than EU trains though?
---
Sorry, but I'm a bit new on GW2. What exactly is these Strike Missions?
---
I am well aware.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chat_link_format#Text_string
---
Many of the ones documented there no longer work, and there are many, MANY more. You need to experiment with the IDs to find the nice exploitable ones.
---
That's great. This game will be in a better place if the content encourages them to step up, tune into the combat, and improve. The more the playerbase is engaged in what's going on, the better things will be.
---
Players can get better. I was worse before raids. I got better to beat raids. Rising to meet raids was one of the most satisfying things I've ever done in this game.
---
It's an engineer build with scrapper elite that gives stealth
---
Agreed. They may be mindless thralls but come on, even BABY Aurene would understand basic commands.
---
They definitely do. Teq is quite a bit easier so that one happens more. Worms takes an organized map, so you usually won't succeed without a guild organizing it.
---
Oh my god, I just bought that endless choya tonic and reported it this morning! If it was my bug report that caused the fix, that would mean they had a turn around of &lt;6 hours. It’s probably a coincidence, but still cool!
---
I've been playing PvP since launch. This is a normal happen when patches go live. I believe it has something to do with the servers.
---
Lol who rage quits gw2?
---
I snorted.
---
In EVE you make friends by targeting others and pressing F1 repeatedly.
---
Welcome to the vigil
---
&gt; - Fixed an issue that caused the Emblazoned Cape to incorrectly appear locked in the Gem Store for players without the Heart of Thorns
---
&gt; - Fixed an issue that caused cape skins to animate oddly on female sylvari characters.
---
&gt; - Fixed an issue that caused some odd cape collision on charr characters due to bone scaling.
---
&gt; - Fixed an issue that prevented the Black Lion Season 4 Expedition Board from appearing correctly in players' home instances under certain conditions.
---
&gt; - Fixed an issue with notifications on the Black Lion Trading Company icon in the menu bar that caused errors for Play for Free players.
---
all gemstore related
---
&gt; - Fixed an issue in which players received essence chest rewards even if they failed the strike missions in the "Whisper in the Dark" episode.
---
&gt; - Fixed an issue that caused the completion of Light Puzzle achievements to reset daily.
---
2 weeks old
---
&gt; - Fixed a bug that caused the Endless Choya Dance Tonic to be hidden in the Novelties section of the Equipment tab.
---
oh look, a kourna item
---
&gt; - Fixed a bug that caused players to be kicked out of the Boneskinner Strike Mission at the beginning of the fight.
---
&gt; -  Adjusted the stats and damage of the boneskinner in the Boneskinner Strike Mission to closer match its intended difficulty. Changed how damage is inflicted on the boneskinner's Tormenting Aura mechanic to preserve the integrity of the intended fight mechanics.
---
actually quick fixes.
---
did i miss anything?
---
&gt; You're assuming that all fixes are have equal difficulty.
---
no, i'm not. i'm just amused by people getting excited at such a collection of fixes.
---
&gt; We don't know why legendary runes aren't fixed yet, but if they were an easy fix they would have been implemented already.
---
that would require them to work on a fix at all, which we have no information about. this was a headline feature of a patch 3 months ago that still doesn't work properly, *that* was my only point. might have just as well mentioned the warclaw which is also still bugged in a rather mundane way (hint: CDs) 🤷‍♀️
---
&gt;  Not fixing things is not due to laziness.
---
i have little doubt in the competency and work morale of many of ANet's devs. it's the management of those resources that's causing me and many other people headaches.
---
I'm on sporadically but I'd be happy to hangout. I like helping newer players.
---
They could've made it about 20 times longer by repeating it over and over within the same message. It's quite entertaining to mess with people by spamming stuff like that, especially if you use messages that don't show up in the chat (only in a bubble), and then pretend like nothing happened when they inevitably respond with confused "wut?"s.
---
I play PvP a fair amount and am a medium skill player and I really enjoy it. I would also say that the future looks bright for the mode. We recently got a new competitive balance team and they are already doing great things. The automated tournament system just got an easier schedule to get your head around and they will be launching Swiss tournaments in the future.
---
There's a lot of doom saying right now but personally I find the competitive parts of the game to be the most fun.
---
I don't think I've ever gone into a group where the run wasn't exactly what I just described unfortunately. It's really turned me off raids altogether.
---
thanks so much for your diligence, all of you, seems like it's a wholesome community over here.
---
RIP Deso / BT.
---
The gold reward is literally just a couple more unidentified gear, and the random groups from LFG are already close to not being able to do any of the bosses. I disagree with you even though I generally like harder content than this.
---
I still like them all. Lot better then the first one they made, in my option.
---
Not really. Gold rewards aren't worth resetting for if you end up getting silver.
---
Wow im loving the devs participation recently on reddit threads
---
[I like the scary baby one](https://i.ebayimg.com/thumbs/images/g/EesAAOSwfgBdFHbO/s-l225.jpg)
---
The problem is not understanding what is hard or easy game development. The problem is standards and expectations for the company as a whole to actually make good decisions for development. This is far too late to be adding capes which has been demanded for since launch of the game 7 years ago.
---
The only thing I remember was they said no raids. That's why i left wow fpr It.
---
Plz enlight me with all your wisdom .
---
F11 -&gt; Control Options -&gt; Screenshot
---
Praise Jormag! Your skinboner has evolved into a boneskinner.
---
Can't wait to try it out.
---
Oh btw I have astralaria but I am currently using boreal skin . Just imagine how weird it is....
---
But how others would know I am rich in fashion war ?
---
Sigh
---
You need ascended gear equipped with the correct amount of Agony Resistance to do tier 4 fractals, and you get an extra edge of dps in Raids and WvW if you have it as well, so besides learning how your class works, getting the best gear is part of the core progression of becoming a decent player at least in those scenarios .
---
You can change the key or unbind it in your controls settings.
---
This needs to go to the top. Walking around in low level maps isn't as cooler if I can't jump over small fences.
---
You are just farming karma points on Reddit complaining Vs anet. This is not a predatory game
---
Happy to help! Feel free to message me here or in game with any other questions you might have.
---
Does these strike missions give any unique rewards?
---
Well assuming they are running the correct stats and not some soldiers gear out of an SW level boost... in that case yeah probably not.
---
eh really, ive hardly seen any teq runs these days that fails. Well, You have to show up early to get in the main maps. If you show up late you might end up in a a overflow map that doesn't have enough people.
---
Is this the font from the elder scrolls? From the documents you read around the world's game?
---
Damnit Boots. LOL
---
Mindless thralls created by the necromancer. Idk but to me it makes sense that the necromancer that created them would be able to tell them what to do, even complex tasks
---
That's an interesting take. You are right, I might be projecting my own experience on to other players too much.
---
I don't play with dps meters or raid, I'm pretty much one of the target demographic for strike missions. I'm also a rarity on these boards because typically only the most vocal elite players care enough about a game to go on discussion boards (see the overwhelmingly negative atmosphere here). But I do my research and at least try to play optimally, if not for others players sake but my own enjoyment.
---
big oof
---
Look, I'm not terribly interested in having a lengthy debate on this because I suspect you've already made up your mind but:
---
- no, cape fixes are not gem store fixes because there is a second cape skin from in game rewards that was also suffering the same issues, so you're just picking and choosing. 
---
- 2 weeks old is a good, reasonable turn around on bug fixes, I'm not sure what you're expecting here. The key thing here is that it *did* get fixed.
---
- again, not sure why having a Kourna issue be fixed is a problem. You're just supporting my point that they aren't just abandoning older things like you suggested with legendary runes. They are still trying to improve various things, not just the newest things.
---
- No information does not mean not working on it, it just means no information. I'm not sure what to tell you here.
---
Only the Grothmar gives unique things: The ebon shoulders, and the chilly chaise are the rare/super rare drops. The only things special you get from the Bjora strikes is some more eltrite ingots.
---
cant be thief thief doesnt have boons and stealth
---
cant wait for the whining of people that dont want to do strikes anymore because its to hard now
---
he had 3 healers in the group tho
---
RIP Strikes
---
Well that's what strike bosses actually should be like, rewarding doing the mechanics instant of just ignoring them...
---
I don't mean to burst your bubble friend, because I'm really happy it got fixed for you and you can enjoy the tonic, but no, a turn around like that isn't realistic. It would take that long just to cook a build with that fix, let alone actually determine the issue and fix it first. But I'm glad it got fixed, yay :D
---
Do you not understand?
---
Yep. a build was released a few hours ago. Updated and all is fine again. Funnily enough, now that I think about it, the problem started on the last build before this one, that happened about 2 or 3 days ago.
---
They were bad though as the initial attempt I saw with this post had him using just one.
---
NOOOO! don't give em any more ideas
---
otherwise they will remove arcdps, make their own awful version and they will try to charge for it!!!
---
Yay! Glad to hear it is fixed, sorry about that!
---
I am a new (\~ 6 months) player and consider myself a "casual". I play for fun, not to measure myself against others. Elite, hard core content doesn't really interest me as I simply don't have enough game time to feel I want to devote hours upon hours to learning one thing.
---
However, that does not mean I don't want to improve, to be the best I can personally be in the class I am playing. 
---
I think veterans and particularly veterans involved in elite end game content tend to forget just how *complex* combat in this game actually is. Those who have been playing for 5 years and more are already probably intimately familiar with every different kind of damage and boon and whatever the hell else. For me it's still confusing af. Reading through every comment in this thread I am now more resolved than ever to never try certain things. Because I am sure learning would make me feel bad.
---
But saying all that, I have no clue what "good" dps is in any given situation. And I have no clue how to find out. The game gives me a bunch of numbers when I hit stuff. Some are bigger than others. That's not something I can use as any kind of benchmark.
---
So, in light of all of the above, how do I figure out what "good" dps is for the current profession I am playing? I much prefer open world content but that does not mean I never want to improve. I am lousy at movement in comparison to many. I only started gaming at the age of 40 and I don't have the kind of muscle memory or motor skills that many people have developed while playing since childhood. I know that and I work on slow improvement but that is something that can't be forced, it will happen over time or it won't. Good dps is something I can effect through the characters I play and how I set them up. So that is what I would like to know about.
---
It is really good the way it is for sure. Many ppl will def say its too difficult, and I agree that not all strikes should be like this. But every 3rd strike being this kind of difficulty is great balance. Praise for that, hopefully itll keep going in this direction.
---
rais are total different requirements then  fractals
---
What do you mean? I have never been there. Who has actually played 11 hours a day for a month?
---
Yeah.. I don't mind it either way, the latest LS episode was so short that I've found myself looking for something else to do literally the day after.
---
Thanks for the help. 
---
It wasn\`t gamebreaking by any means, just somewhat annoying .
---
can the drops be bought from the trading post or are they account bound?
---
Duly noted! I have some dungeons I haven’t done yet before I break into fractals, though I don’t 100% understand what they are, but they are on my horizon goals.
---
Legit harder than Cairn, MO and Samarog.
---
As I understand it, the Dancing Choya Tonic only bugged recently - I think with tuesday's patch. It's not an item that's been bugged since introduction.
---
I’ve had GW2 for ~5 years and still don’t even have the griffon... I’m lowest of casuals lol
---
You like have your screenshot key bound to something like Ctrl+S.
---
Go top Options&gt;Control&gt;Screenshot and check your binding, and change it to something else  like the Print Screen button.
---
They have no excuse to add features to an equip slot then not make that available for legendary pieces. Once again, Anet screws over vets. The legendary back-pieces are few and have not been in the game too long.
---
Anet slowly eroding my disappointment.
---
What if icebrood saga is actually good?
---
CMs fractals are bleeding ppl for months and its getting noticable. there are no peak hours anymore,i usualy waiting for half hour every time and it can be 7am or  7 pm.
---
Icebrood is easily walking to the top season quality wise.
---
Quality, not quantity tough.
---
Still broken
---
Shoulders and Chair are sellable (84g~ and 450g~ respectively).Eltrite is account bound, but you can get it from chests and the raven sanctum too, so it's not exclusive to strikes :)
---
Ah, even better then, that's nice!
---
I just went to check it and it's indeed fixed! Thanks a lot :D
---
That fucking hill in queensdale just north of the brewery heart killed so many of my characters because I refused to learn that lesson
---
whats the chair called?
---
res skill on ele works too.
---
It's something like the Chilly Chaise.
---
Strike Missions are a new type of content, usually a single boss fight, that is between open world and "easy" Raid Boss in difficulty. 
---
Dont believe the meme any longer though, as the patch 2h ago made Boneskinner MUCH harder than its co-fights
---
Oh, I'm good. I spent time perfecting my build and rotation. I'm good to go. I average benchmark dps on the golem. Then it comes time to put it all to the test and I'm sitting there at Cairn waiting for 3 hours while people wipe then disband. I'd say that 2/3 times, we don't even down the boss. People just start to get frustrated and leave.
---
If you think I'm going in there and pressing "11111", you're mistaken.
---
Is that a sarcasm? Playing WvW just to get warclaw (and gifts of whatever) is physically painful. Warclaw I understand, since it's core WvW feature, but why are gifts exclusive for that mode? I'm taking a valuable map slot, something a person who actually likes WvW could use. I'm not having fun, and neither is zerg who I'm latching to, since WvW is boring me to tears, there's no incentive to play or care, and I'm just spamming skills and focusing on keeping participation high instead of actually giving a fuck.
---
just that desolation is a t1 server and gankdara t2... but i'm not about the serversclinces here. gandara people obviously cannot join on desolation / blacktide anyways, so keep your drama in your own pockets.
---
Yeh I manage pretty well with the griffon, I do need to get the beetle back on my to do list, those things look fun.
---
Phew good thing I got my 10ap when it was faceroll! Now I can go back to complaining about dead game.
---
Considering how much bigger Primordus and Kralk got, i'm not worried.
---
Boneskinner will kick your butt now.   
---
Hard. 
---
Well not terribly hard, compared to actual raid bosses, but definitely a step up from everything outside of them, and a massive step from open world / story.   
---
Its also not impossible to beat, even for pugs that have no idea what theyre doing - as long as theyre willing to learn and fail a couple runs.
---
there was no real need to comment here, if this was all you got.
---
btw, nearly any class is played in wvw. and scrapper is only that important bc a bunch of cowards love to blob up and drop their condibombs from a quite nuts range.
---
i'm not teaching blob-battles here, so calm your panics. guess you're one of the spanish blobbers of Baruch Bay?
---
So much more interesting!
---
 100 pushups, 100 situps, 100 squats, and running 10km every single day
---
&gt;I think saying things are too late is a very pointless
---
Is that not also opinion?
---
Secondly, seven years later after, which GW1 had capes inherently, is a long time to add something that veterans wanted from the beginning. That is all factual. 
---
&gt; It's also an opinion but you state it like a fact. 
---
You obviously do not know how to debate, because opinion is backed up with facts. My first comment was opinion combined with facts which makes it truthful.
---
No air conditioning
---
&gt;Your skinboner
---
How do I unread that
---
Fair warning: Drakkar is almost certainly NOT going to look like this in episode 2. The dev concept for it in the august announcement had a much different appearance.
---
Who gets annoyed if you tell them to dodge the AoE instead of face tank it? Who gets personal if you tell them to read a guide first, because nine people waiting for one isnt a plausible route? Who messages you that you are a horrible person five minutes straight after you booted him for not writing back after asking him for his Li? Who freaks out if you tell him his damage is below the Mesmer support?
---
we're fine, don't worry. we're apparently that fine that for example the WSR server created own hateguilds to express their salt towards the beatings they got from our groups.
---
I think it's okay for people to step up their game and learn an encounter again. It's completely okay not to master it the first time around.  A rewarding fight is one you have to work for :)
---
There's something in the water, ooOOoh~!
---

Time to stack a whole bunch of DHs and FBs. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
&gt;Many groups do not require a healer at all, and chrono cannot provide good boon uptime other than quickness and alacrity.
---
The loss of chrono didn't change this. In healerless groups previously, might and fury was handled by the group in large. Chrono providing a little while dps mainly blasted off of fire fields and stance share Soulbeast/Warriors
---
Chrono, for the regular group, was always paired with druid, who covered those. Very similar to the current setup, barring mobile quickness/alacrity and stab spam
---
[Even the elitists struggle with this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwHJxZPgRE)
---
What I’m more curious about is how many of those complaining that it was such a face roll will be complaining it’s too hard.
---
Grotham strikes grant exactly that
---
Just ran into a toxic raiding Guild flaming their pugs over the Boneskinner Strike.   
---
They were still running it when I already completed it with a new Group of pugs. 
---
Ignorant casuals exist.   
---
Toxic Raiders exist.   
---
Stop making excuses for either side
---
It is all nice and all, but may I ask Why? IMHO game should be a nice relaxing entertainment that I can spend some time after work, I do not want to work after work, sorry. And all that effort for some trash rewards? Nop. I am really happy for people who want their hard content so they can play what they want to play, and it is great that Anet is listening, but you will not see me there.
---
This looks good but now watch how threads about it being too hard are gonna flood this reddit. 
---
I believe this to be an actual stepping stone even if proper squads might have an easy time with it obviously.
---
Dont be so sensitive!
---
Going PvP. 
---
;D
---
Because now I know how many times I've opened that chest to absolutely shit loot before I get my Ember infusion :\^).
---
You are correct.  Though I think unless you are going to focus on WvW or PvP, crafting is still the best way to get it.
---
spellbreaker also deals pretty horrible standard dmg, but it works with tons of utility bunker-buildwise often.
---
Now, that's an updated not some shoulder TOWELS.
---
I was talking about PvE
---
EVOS kills the wurms every/most evenings at 10pm eastern! Jion us for Wurm food!
---
I will try all of that. But  even with hitting a combat dummy, how do I know what is "good" vs "bad" dps? Or is this more subjective than people make it sound? Is there an objective measure for a baseline of damage dealt?
---
*Looks at how many millions of trash I have salvaged.*
---
Yeah, that's totally useful information :I.
---
Blasphemy!
---
a pretty big part acutally. you can definitely enjoy big parts of the game without using your wallet, i started 1,5 years ago that way too. i wanted to test it but at lv70 or so i knew that i want to buy the expansions. took me about one month bc i have never played a MMO before and wanted to take my time - imo it was worth it, gw2 is a pretty fun game!
---
or you just delete the 250ish stacks of them repeatedly, because u don't level the crafting disciplines. :P
---
If they had the tech to provide that information to us in any other way I'd agree with you. But they don't.
---
True. Strike missions are doable without any effort at all with 4-5 players covering basic boons and afk mode.
---
Are you even having fun in the game if you play only for rewards?
---
damn, wasn't going to try but after seeing this i can't help myself, I'll definitely hit u up first thing i do in game
---
The correct title should be "toxic elitist vs toxic casual"
---
and you have obviously not been around the game when stairs were much deadlier
---
Aka "we already have an animation rig for a dragon, let just make a generic looking dragon with ice".
---
Literally every single pug in lfg asks for HB. Every single day i offer my teams to run QB and they ask me to stay heals.
---
There are NO lfg adds for no heals in NA lfg, ever. In the last 2 months ive seen ONE, and made one myself.
---
We have been several tonight wondering if the Boner has been corrected for the AOEs that were not functional but it seems to have become almost impossible for a majority of players to do, we wonder even if the torches work correctly, if they are well counted when they are rekindled etc.
---
Do you also have the impression that there is a problem now in its functioning?
---
Be careful, I'm not talking about the fix, we knew it wasn't normal that it wasn't so easy to kill but now there's really a problem that even very good players can't understand, I saw a group that managed to do it and then they spent more than an hour there and now they refuse to do it again saying that for them it doesn't work properly.
---
about wvw; you can get budget food from a permanent vendor that costs one time 1gold and then sells u cheap utility and food.
---
since i personally did not level crafting, all my ascended stuff come from wvw, which is by now one 5/6 full and one \~3/6 full char, and i'm just wvw rank 320ish
---
Be careful, hopefulness is dangerous in this place.
---
I dont think its hard, now we know mechanics so a bit organised team and semi auto attack should do it. 
---
And scourge heal :)
---
We just need to learn to play as team ;)
---
Well, the problem is, some of the things aren't fun and there is a lot of other stuff to do in the game purely for "fun". So far, I haven't found any of the strike missions fun or engaging. Trying to kill the 4 djinns in hanging gardens the other day was more of a challenge.
---
In na takes less time. Because you spend as much time getting a team for 0heal than you do for just running the damn thing with hb.
---
Source: at least 300 of my ess on HB.
---
scrappers must really hurt you thaha. that to be said, playing scrapper is feeling like playing piano, tons of clicking around to clear the billions of stacked condis of the enemy blobs.
---
Would be cool if he was boonskinner. You know like , skinning off the boons from players...., :D
---
A daily repeatable boss only for fun? What game are you playing? MMO's  give incentive for players to repeat content for times on end BECAUSE of rewards. You changed your original argument pretty quick.
---
They also stated that concept art was very old and the appearance has changed.
---
THough TBH, that appearance more resembles the [ice column creature](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ice_column_statue).
---
my brain cells got fried when i attempted to level my crafting, so it wasn't a option for me personally. and well, for basic pvp u don't need more than a bit understand of your class, for basic wvw u basically need to invest much time.
---
i've gone into wvw back then with a potato equipment that wasn't even lv80, the jump to lv80 exotic yet was incredibly quick. the ascended stuff came from lucky drops and random rank rewards. (1,5 chars armor, 3 weapons sofar)
---
I've literally not seen anyone complaining about the difficulty.
---
Or they stop because they don't want to run in to the people moaning about bad dps.
---
You can compare it to the benchmarks on the site. If you use the same buffs, you should be able to hit close to those numbers with the same rotations. It's fully objective what the best rotations and DPS in a vaccuum is.
---
For a group it will differ because you might not have proper support, people might fail mechanics, etc. If you only have 1 stack of might instead of 25 in a group, that'll be a huge damage decrease. But that's what the DPS meter is for. If you enable logging you can see literally everything about the fight.
---
If you tell me the class you play I can point you to a specific page with all the meta builds for it.
---
Plus you also get a ton of weapons through Structured PvP and World versus World reward tracks. Which is good, but ArenaNet still hasn't quite hit the mark with rewards. Slightly cheaper 32-slot bags are welcome, though. And at least they made the crafted exotics sellable; that's a step in the right direction
---
Toss Eilxir R worked the last time I did the mission. Presumably any reviving skill does.
---
Exactly. I have all the achievements, all the restored weapons, over 600 eternal ice shards, the minis, the recipes, the home instance node. No reason for me to ever go back. Incredibly disappointing because I absolutely love the map. The meta is too long and boring as hell. Just another Lake Doric where no one goes back unless it's the daily. 🙄
---
You.
---
Amazing kill guys :relieved:
---
Rare und fest I believe, so not really worth stressing over, but fun to aim for
---
Difficult content is surviving perfectly fine. Raids and Fractals are perfectly doable and done a lot even if ANet decimated the populations with their terrible update schedule. ANet is just too incompetent to keep supporting it. 
---
It's harder to find a squad for the Grothmar strike than it is to find for actual fun instanced content.
---
Didn't they remove the function to hide weapons?
---
What changed?
---
If you think its elistism to use basic game mechanics in end game content you are probably too sensitive
---
I know right? Why doesn't he give the chance of dropping an exclusive weapon or even better an armour piece made of his skin?
---
Once again the rewards in this game negate the effort required.
---
Anyone can tank, though ChronoTank remains one of the most efficient choices for many encounters. I've seen Tank Druid and Tank Firebrand though, and even Boon Thief as the tank at Cardinal Adina.
---
Chrono is also great as a DPS. Mirage is the preferred Condi DPS for many encounters.
---
Now it just needs to drop some shinies instead of just generic strike rewards. Currently it's not worth fighting although it's a juicy fight. Thanks for fixing it Anet.
---
What a depressing statement :(
---
Satisfaction.
---
7 years later!
---
I mean, thats what the game advertised on launch, and that was such a beautiful ideology. So excuse me if its depressing to desire a divergence from the holy Trinity
---
Yousaywhatnow!? This changes everything!
---
Remember when people suggested capes, build templates, out of combat weapon switching, and any amount of UI customizability?
---
It happened... 7 years later and because the game is having a mass Exodus. "No, wait! Come back! We have build templates and capes, just like you asked for! Don't leave us, please!"
---
Bad news, it's the future and most gamers are like him.
---
That's why games and platforms now all require some sort of level/status/title/achievement system. The digital cookie for doing a thing is more important than the thing.
---
Playing games for challenge or entertainment now is passe.
---
old bug, HUGE disincentive for Migraine achieve
---
Desolation is fine to do this on go for it! :)
---
Literally I've only seen 1 or 2 guild/premade groups do no healbrand in LFG, and that's because they're missing a player. I've basically never seen no heal groups, and even less frequently heal renegade.
---
Ya, power Spellbreaker is only at ~30k but I was going off full professions and Warrior has much higher DPS options with Berserker both power and condi. Also Spellbreaker does have some utility when against enemies with lots of boons like specific fractal instabilities. But ya, the more PvP oriented specs (scrapper, spellbreaker) have lower DPS in general.
---
Nice, eager to try it tomorrow. Cheers for info.
---
Dungeons (and fractals) are usually good with power damage to burst down or phase the targets. Reaper has good cleave as well for dungeons (well when you're not skipping everything like you should). In general though I'd say dragonhunter or daredevil (DPS and skipping) are nice in dungeons if you're not committed to one or the other, if you are then my vote is reaper.
---
Unknown: *"Oxygen."*
---
In fairness, the people who would be complaining probably just won't play the content.
---
LOL you don't know the difference between rage and embarrassment.
---
We do ofc have gear, outside of exotic there are ascended and legendary gear. Those have the same stats but are better then exotic. When you reached that point then it is about your skill level. Getting better at what you do is what makes you a good players. 
---
The combat system is very deep if you understand how to use it. There is so much you can do with it then just autoattack and when you get to that point and start to understand it, then the fun begins.
---
And ofc you need to have some long term goals outside of this. Like ther are several mounts in this game outside of the basic that comes with PoF. They all are uinique with unique pupose and getting them can take quite a while. Maybe you like a legendary and want to craft this. Something that also take time.
---
Maybe you want to get in to raids, fractals, spvp or WvW all this have different demands and all up to you to learn and adjust. 
---
A simple thing about skills, is to join a PvP match. A 5/5 were you very likely the first times will find your self respawning more then you playing. This is when you realise that shit i need to get better or i will be stuck. Real progress that actaully means something :)
---
There are a lot of dead zones out there.
---
Congratulations, you logged in, here is your cookie.
---
The exotics only made a profit the first week imo but maybe they'd be good mystic forge fuel for the right person.
---
That would be terrific
---
yw
---
That's cool... there is tons of content in this game for you already if that is how you want to play it.
---
I've tried it with a few more people but the champ golems ruined it. That's why I thought a big zerg could do it. Maybe (as the other commenter said) if I put an LFG for that when there's an Daily in that map...
---
&gt; Why can’t they have a “strike” version and a “raid“ version
---
Double development time. Difficulty scale, mechanics, expectations are different from a raid to a strike. The Boneskiner is perhaps harder than the other two strikes, it's still considerably easier than most raid bosses for the general PVE audience.
---
I'm not saying you don't have a point though, recycling the strikes into raids bring lots of recycling, which is good, but at the end of the day assets and props are only one fraction of the equation, you still have to design a hard fight and prepare a long list of thematic rewards. Plus, raids actually have a storyline with voice actors and all. The expectations for a raid aren't where the strikes are going.

lol it reminds me of bomblade from eso. I'll definitely try this, as I love bomblade.

😂😂😂
---
It is one 1 of like 50 visual bugs from the warclaw. The person is not doing the jump at all but it shows for the zerg. 
---
There are clamw spinning around, showing up out of no were, showing up out of no were for a brief sec and then gone again, Warclaw stuck in jumping down animation, Warclaw hoovering, Warclaw with people standing on it, on the side of it, warclaw under the ground, warclaw no vannish when dismount, Warclaw sliding sideway, warclaw flying in next to you well there are more visual bugs but i stop there.
---
Then we have the issue were you can not use the maul, you jump in and the maul do not go off and now you are in troubel, This happen every other time. There are known reason to why and unknown. 
---
You can also unmount and get stuck in a hoovering animation on your character were you fly around over the ground. You don't notice it but people around you will. This can not be fixed until map swap or re-log. 
---
Anyway you will have to get used too it and more that i did not bring up because none of them have ever been fixed since the Warclaw came to WvW.
---
That might be a bit much. Hard to do anything with the data of the entire playerbase in general since it's not like you can ask the highest performers for tips.
---
Maybe a compromise on that idea would be to show average / max in squad or instance? How you hold up to your immediate peers may be more tangible. I mean either way this is a pipe dream but y'know.
---
It's definitely a DPS bottleneck Strike Mission for public groups.  People were downing left &amp; right to the basic mechanics. Eventually the stack got a little better, but at least half the squad was stubbornly standing in front of the boss for the first several pulls until they realized it wasn't the wisest idea.  I had to swap off CondiQB to HealBrand.  I really wish I could have just played CondiQB.  I'm getting pretty close to a stack of ingots &amp; Ep 1/2 currency so I may call it quits next week.
---
Yup, weapon armor and artificer. Yes, all ascended equipment is account bound.
---
i still only made a trolly reply because i find it funny and naive to get excited like the person i originally replied to over a list of fixes like this, especially given some adequate context. this is also the point that you don't seem to get.
---
&gt; - no, cape fixes are not gem store fixes because there is a second cape skin from in game rewards that was also suffering the same issues, so you're just picking and choosing.
---
gem store *related*, stop moving the goal post. and don't act like it's not a given that capes are going to be ANet's next cashcow, just as outfits, mailcarriers, finishers, glider skins, mount skins, and a couple more were before. these fixes will predominantly be used to ensure the quality of future gemstore offers.
---
&gt; - 2 weeks old is a good, reasonable turn around on bug fixes, I'm not sure what you're expecting here. The key thing here is that it did get fixed.
---
let's take the light puzzle achievements as example. these are run-of-the-mill "open chest X get achievement Y" achievements of which there are literally hundreds in the game already. that is hot fix material. 2 weeks is generally a decent time frame, however on something as trivial as this i'd question that.
---
&gt; - again, not sure why having a Kourna issue be fixed is a problem. You're just supporting my point that they aren't just abandoning older things like you suggested with legendary runes. They are still trying to improve various things, not just the newest things.
---
if it would have been a bug from all the way back then, it would be pretty sad to see something so trivial get fixed only 1.5y after it was introduced. if what grimm_captain says is indeed accurate, that would only mean that they somehow, without even (as far as we can assume) working on anything related, managed to bug out a random item from 1.5y ago and didn't realize it until it hit live. that's some fine spaghetti.
---
&gt; - No information does not mean not working on it, it just means no information. I'm not sure what to tell you here.
---
the discussion about anet and communication is as old as... basically HoT. oh, btw, legendary armor? yeah, that's also still missing its fixes, and in that case they even acknowledged the issues. thing is, even when modern day anet is communicating it doesn't mean much. they full on lied to us several times throughout season 4. after what they have allowed themselves over the last few months all *i* will believe in are tangible meaningful results, such as actually working new systems, or thoughtful balance changes like we saw on tuesday (good job on most of those btw). i won't get excited about them addressing issues that affect their revenue stream ASAP while months and years old **released** features remain in unfinished states.
---
You can not enter season 3, 4 and 5 maps unless you actaully have the chapter. Season 2 is Silver Waste and Dry Top and those comes with the core game so he will have them regardless if he have season 2 or not.

---
Hard to put it into words. I liked the idea that GW2 was designed around before the HoT expansion. It was less of a designed roll, and more of all classes contributed more than just raw damage. And it put more emphasis on the player's skill and knowledge with their profession.
---
Every class had the ability to bring a little something to the table to help the entire team out. And if you looked at the core game's mechanics you can see it pretty clearly. While you did not have a dedicated healer, that did not mean that you were a team of DPS. That's primarily what the Utilities were for. Rather than just being used for Damage like they are in raids, they were used to help the entire team out or quickly shift the fight about.
---
Guardian's barrier,  the combo fields which applied boons that were unique to certain finishers, Slowing down the enemies  so they can be more easily kited and cut down. Regen was really the only external healing in a class's kit and it was designed more to help them shrug off blows they take rather than completely restore them till their class 6 skill comes back online. But this was all back before the power creep, and the dungeons were so bad they could melt your face if you did not cheese them.
---
Now you introduce a healer and dedicated tank roll... and suddenly it doesn't feel as interactive (my opinion).
---
No problems here. Here you go, try this one:

Z&gt;bAhi)&gt;CMgKdg\_#YXap
---
&gt; If you think its elistism to use basic game mechanics in end game content you are probably too sensitive
---
Where did I said that?...
---
None of the previous questions was about using basic game mechanics. Maybe you should read stuff properly first.
---
What about those players who also knew for a fact that their key was ok and then got their account terminated because it turned out it was not.... Lots of those posts here on reddit and they were also dead certain.
---
Getting an account hijacked because of pro passwords like: Hallo123, GW2PaZZword, or MunchesterUn1ted, is pretty stupid.
---
Get creative, think of a Neologism and put random numbers somewhere.
---
If you can't remember it at first write it down and put the paper under your keyboard. That's where I hide mine. Don't tell anyone.
---
After a short while you won't need it anymore.
---
It usually coincides with the break-bars on the main boss.  The gimmick being, new shiny skill = new shiny usage  If you get it outside of the break-bar then someone said that it one-shots the spectral-flame adds or something.
---
YES please! Then i would actaully use them!!!
---
It has been fixed. Thank you! :)
---
I mean, if you don't get any enjoyment out of killing a difficult boss, then yea, Raids are a waste of time.   
---
But then, what is enjoyment? Loot? Gold? None of these things mean anything. If you don't get enjoyment out of a challenge, out of using the potential of your class/build, whats the point in even playing? You could play Candy Crush, if the only enjoyment is opening a loot box
---
You can play power chrono and condi mirage.
---
Why would they be upset? They can still see their own, why should i be forced to watch something i find looking like a unicorn throwed up and really hurts my eye?
