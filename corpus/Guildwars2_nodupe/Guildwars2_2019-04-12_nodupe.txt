Why do you have useless gemstore stuff in your shared inventory slots?
---
---
---
o/
---
It's under Tekkit &gt; Super Adventure Box &gt; Tribulation Mode
---

---
Make sure you've updated both Taco and your Tekkit pack, it's quite new.
---
Came here just to see what class was used haha.
---
I don’t? Both of my shared inventory slots are empty
---
All of my characters use a different title based on what I think fits them, or just what looks cool.
---
My main stays Good Apple... except at the moment he's Honors in Applied Jumping because I'm proud of that giant headache. I'll swap him back to Good Apple once SAB is over.
---
Sweet! I get to stream the GvG on Monday. Check it out @900pm est on [my Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/schliggerments)
---
Eternal on main PvE character to show I'm not a total bad.  Ultimate Dominator in WvW to show my dominance over the casuals even though most people have it now.
---
It looks too good to sell imo. My favorite mount skin by far
---
Oh my bad. I'm not used to seeing people having the slots not in a seperate row.
---
their shared slots are empty...
---
Would you buy a house if the foundation was crumbling.
---
Contracts -&gt; permanent bank/tp/etc contract. Not the mount skin stuff.
---
None
---
Don't feel the need to flaunt anything, meh.
---
If you just have normal gw2TacO get the [all-in-one pack](http://tekkitsworkshop.net/index.php/gw2-taco/download) from tekkit and install it as it describes (don't unzip it). That will give you all the paths as well as a ton of other helpful features. In Taco turn off whatever markers you don't want (I'd turn off the default festival ones and use tekkit's instead).

You've encountered dozens of mechanics, if not hundreds.
---
* How to use your Dodge Button, and some practice using it.    
---
* How to train skills, how to equip skills, what skills do what.    
---
* How to train traits, how to equip specs, what traits do what.    
---
* How Conditions work, how to apply them, how to remove them. Same goes for stuns.    
---
* What enemy types mean. Veteran &lt; Elite &lt; Champion &lt; Legendary.    
---
* How to waypoint, how to get around the world.    
---
* How to resurrect other players.    
---
* How to use the trading post, a vague idea of what items you should keep or not keep.    
---
* Optionally, if you've tried it, Crafting. Where is it, how it works.
---
* What are events, how do they work, how do events chain together sometimes.    
---
* In addition, Meta Events, world bosses. What are they? How can you tell a meta event from a regular event?   
---
These are all things you have encountered.    
---
These are all tiny things, right? I agree. They're all small.
---
Trying to learn all these tiny things at once, with a character you don't know how to play, in a zone you don't know how to leave, with a higher difficulty, with events going on around you and people yelling? That's... not easy.
---
We say don't boost not because a hypothetical, but because veteran players see it every day. I've had someone in the first map of HoT not res me because he thought he needed a skill for it. I had to teach him to res. I've had to teach people how to waypoint. One person went straight there and didn't even know that maps are separated by loading screens.
---
It's rough. We give that advice because we see the downsides of not taking it almost every time we step into Verdant Brink or Crystal Oasis.
---
Nope, Vizunah Square may be my favorite  mission of all the campaigns. It's just pure fight all the time. Loved it !
---
[removed]
---
Isn't the northwest most outpost called Kaineng Center and the rest just known as Kaineng City?
---
Up vote for Cantha.
---
Airlizard. tm
---
No one does, you have to pay to have something like that done.
---
.
---
Oh for Gods' sake no.
---
I can't think of anything I would hate more than being forced to play Tribulation just to finish the story. I realize that some people really enjoy the challenge, but many of us absolutely do not. I dabble in it every now and again, but I would loathe it being a requirement to reaching the end of SAB.
---
I'm a roleplayer at heart. So I only really use somewhat thematic titles for my characters (or none if I have none). Somewhat because I sometimes stretch it a little if a title is close enough. Aside from that, I also generally prefer shorter titles over longer ones (i.e.: commander over general-commander. Not sure if the last is a real title, but you get my point). Also, I never use meta titles like "Been there, done that".
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
 I use 'hunter' on my Norn ranger, and 'veteran' on my Asura engineer, to use my two most-played characters.
---
Fractal Prodigy because my char is named Fractal Prodigy
---
(It's all about the attitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich)
---
Leaves no hero behind for my healers.
---
Correction: Rox stated Canach believed he was heading to Janthir. Nothing actually says he was (esp given he was actually heading to his mansion).
---
Besides, this was before Lazarus' death, and Caudecus was after retrieving jade armors to use against the Seraph. If there's something there, it's probably just more jade armors, supposedly. Not really something that the Commander can use.
---
There's nothing plot worthy to go there, except making something like "person tries to use ancient mursaat relics to cause problem" but that would just be repeating part of Season 3's plot in a way.
---
Would you strengthen the foundation, if it wasnt crumbling but the roof was leaking?
---
Getting around in that environment would be a lot of fun too, especially with mounts now. 
---
As interesting as it was to look at in Gw1, it could be a pain to traverse at times if you didn’t know your way around it well.
---
T-posing is the hardest Flex.
---
These are great but it bothers me you left out the Cantha starter island from your Cantha image. I loved those maps.
---
Oh i do most of the time too but just wanted to highlight how focus makes life easier.
---
I actually have been writing for a long time. That's why I knew you did. And I know exactly what you mean; writing is an art, not something you can just slap onto a tool. I often have to cut or go around all the ideas I want and love as well, to make sure my story stick to its course. Great minds think alike ;D
---
Zerker Ammy
---
Long bow necro please!
---
You, Sir, are a man of good taste!
---
I got a rock...
---
go about 1/3rd of the way through when they have a full queue with them. only time we outnumbered them was the first two fights, we had a whopping 3 fbs and a mostly pug group. still ran them down every time they went to run
---
Hello. Quitting eso due to unbearable lag. I used to play gw2 when it first came out but I'm probably gonna start fresh.
---
Classes - I don't want a mage class. Which class is the best for me if I want to. 1) I'm a completionist so I'll be looking to do a tonne of open world. 2) from what I've seen on YouTube, fractals are something I'd be interested in. 3) I'm not super interested in pvp, but I wouldn't mind dabbling in it.
---
Race / Class combo - for the class you suggest above, is there a race combo that suits it in terms of aesthetics and or skills
---
I heard there is a gem store or something to spend real money on in game. Does this place offer experience boosters of any kind? My goal is to Max level quickly and then start "completeing achievements"
---
I will have about 500 gold to start. So I heard I should Max two crafting professions for levelling fast? What else should I buy
---
Finally - Any aussie guilds
---
Many thanks
---
Its an action combat system, if you don't like maybe this game isn't for you. Its not too much to ask that the skills we use actually do something.
---
I'm rich, you know.
---
I have LNHB, Voice in the Void, and Champion of Zommoros too, but I always feel they are too elitist, so I always switch back to that.
---
Badass cannon we see in those pact ship would be good, the ship looks and feels awakard as a Legendary in my option....
---
I used the Black Citadel as my main banking city when I was farming Thunderhead Keep - it was honestly refreshing having a reason to be there.
---
A lot of one-shot builds. Knowing what build your enemy run is what wins most fights.
---
An interesting thing to note is that, if the devs follow the full world map's design of both the [ingame asset](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Tyria_(world)_map_2.png) and the [cleaned up fan edit of the map](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Tyria_world_fan_map.jpg) (which the devs admittedly did end up altering somewhat when it came to not including that huge lake in eastern Desolation), Shing Jea would've become a peninsula at this point in time. :)
---
People better at their rotations, people pre-buffed before an engagement, people using food/utility items, or people supported by team mates.  Sometimes it's just a class with high burst damage that blows all their cool downs at once.
---
I have the same problem with my weaver, where sometimes I get a good 1v1 (whether I win or lose), but sometimes I just get absolutely melted (3-shot) before I can even react.
---
[No reason...](https://imgur.com/a/24iqTTS)
---
 I can't decide whether this is funny or pathetic. The group you're fighting looked smaller than you so I paused the video at one point and counted them. They had what looks to be 21 versus the 37 you have in squad. Meaning you have close to twice their numbers. Possibly even more if there are pugs floating around out of squad.
---
Does this feel like an accomplishment to you? An accomplishment to the extent that you need to make a 17 minute video jerking yourself off because you ran over a group that you outnumbered almost two to one? You should honestly just take this video and use it as review footage so you can look over it and accurately assess your group's performance because after watching this, I don't see anything worth bragging about within it.
---
Or Tooth of Jormag, since we are finally able to damage it with magic during LWS3 A Crack in the Ice. Or the Eye of Kralkatorrik in LWS5 All or Nothing
---
The people who are unable to self-reflect on their gameplay and instead call everyone else salty are the ones who are perpetually stuck in a rut. These old veterans who think they are infallible are the real toxic element in the community, even moreso than the "elitist GvG'ers" or "selfish PvE pugs". The sad part is they stick around the longest because they are so invested in their own fantasy.
---
Oh shit what if Kralkatorrik's eye is the next legendary trinket
---
Mission bonus is always completion time... no fkin thanks.
---
The Blazing Light or Light in the Darkness on my general pve characters, because they're cool.
---
LNHB on characters when I run fractals with them b/c #lolkplol.
---
I've never used a raid title, and I only have The Eternal.
---
Peak Performance  being what it is is just like seaweed shuffles and giving up dodges with stick and move all over again.  If it had a real"window" but agree, current state is "bola, NOW MAKE SURE YOU BURST AND SPIN TO WIN WITH AXE 5". Is basically like the old  Greatsword  F1  dodge if full endurance HUNDREEEEED BLLAAAADDES".  If any boss other than sabetha spin through and greatsword throw.  I kind of miss the old peak  purely because the spell breaker rotation  actually felt like more than just face rolling axe. But i'll be damned if I have to suffer through another round of stick and move  garbage .  At least the axe has stow weapon on double chop into triple(stowing weps is another thing but thats not so relevant to this post).   I like what you say about using correct window for  the burst mechanic.  Right now i'm just  using  eviserate  unlike the former spell breaker what was it, dagger mace mace dagger?
---
Grandmaster of Golden Arms
---
I just like the sound of it.
---
It's too late for that. He needs gw1s hourly reminder
---
Buy another bank tab.
---
God I've wanted an elite spec that lets you focus in a single element so bad for elementalists.
---
Revenant named Khanhei of the Mist is Closer to the Stars because Cantha
---
Yes Cantha was well explored in GW1.
---
Kralkatorrik was the final villain of the novel, his minions were full across Ascalon, and the xpc got to "save him", then we got to fight his minions and himself. I think it's enough to show part of him at least but naw, he's not even a character. Also the novel already said his mind was filled with hunger and all the bad stuff.
---
Considering that core Elementalist has smaller pool of weapons compared to other Professions, I think it's tolerable. The only thing with less options at core is the Engineer with 4 choices, though some may argue their Weapon Kits compensate for that. 
---
As for your argument about the about the Elite Specialization weapon, that's a fair point. I would say just give them both?
---
 The thing is, anyone else with a 2-handed weapon granted by an Elite Spec, say Reaper Greatsword or Renegade Shortbow, are getting 5 weapon skills from Ascended weapons. No matter what, that gives them an edge over one-handers, which only grant 2 or 3 weapon skills, depending on mainhand or offhand. 
---
If we really wanted to keep things fair, that would mean one-hander Elite Spec weapons like Weaver Sword or Chronomancer Shield granting 5 skills, or 2-hander options, like Druid Staff or Dragonhunter Longbow, granting only 2 or 3 skills. There's no way to really compensate for that, it's just a core quirk of the system.
---
It would be the same case with the Arcanist getting a mainhand Axe / offhand Mace. Again, it's technically two weapons, but functionally and mechanically, it's comprabale
---
crab toss champion
---
It's so sad that monks basically didn't get into this game because of ANet's ass-backwards philosophy on healing when this game first started, and then instead of guardians getting a monk spec, rangers got a druid spec.
---
I use a power glove and a power pad mat.
---
The only things I have bound on my mouse are dodge, call target and about face (180 degree character turn).
---
I never felt the need to use anything else since keys were easy to reach on keyboard.
---
I've (purposely) never used a single one but I did start displaying LNHB lately since so many groups ask for it.
---
Semi long term goal was the pvp champion title for all the professions so I just use those on the respective character
---
What about classes that bring signets that never get pressed, though? Timing upkeep on a buff from a skill is an engaging part of rotation. Not the *most* engaging for sure, but this game offers a ton of different play styles. Want to play piano for deeps? Weaver. Want to layer modifiers with short durations for big burst? Dragonhunter. Want to deal consistent damage with regular burst? Daredevil. Etc
---
Necro haters eternally btfo
---
I recognised that, which is why I tried to seperate it from my other remark. But maybe I should've been more clear. Still, you know, there's a good chance the OP has some stashed in their bank somewhere which is why I put it there.
---
As I understood it, the borderlands are fractals, but the inhabitants are a mix of fractal (guards) and not (players). That's what I gathered from the lines *"Warriors of all backgrounds have been venturing into the Mists for centuries to participate in a never-ending cycle of conquest colloquially known as the Mist Wars. We have long believed that these battlegrounds exist in a repetitious "fractal state.""*
---
The battles take place in fractals, but the fighters are not (all) fractal inhabitants, but rather the inhabitants side with the fighters based on favor/actions (capturing towers, etc.).
---
Similar situation for sPvP, really.
---
"The profession itself bears many similarities to the ritualist from Guild Wars Factions, who could channel spirits from the Mists and often wore blindfolds to help them focus."
---
-Directly from the GW2 wiki
---
I wouldn't try to apply logic to it. There's nothing to prejudice except beyond idiocy passed down by older generations. Lots of infighting between East Asian cultures, many years of wars, a general air of "we are the superior country, all the other Asian cultures are dogs." It's rampant and is going to need a very long period of peace to be able to fix.
---
Hmm I dunno. You can't get UD in a very short time period. It will often take 2 - 5 years.
---
I'd like to see a longbow elemental, shooting fire and lightning arrows. Would be as close as I'm going to get to my main in Asherons Call.
---
My inventory rules are;
---
1. If you can't eat it, sell it.
---
2. If you can't sell it, trash it.
---
How detrimental.
---
You forgot we are getting a new living world episode... the mount is a bonus.
---
Get real.
---
My Scarlet Briar toon uses 'Hero of Lions Arch'
---
Why would you report a multiboxer who doesn't negatively impact the gameplay of others around them *in any way*?
---
Well done, always glad to see personal improvement and responsibility. While it is "just a game", social responsibilities are a big part of group content!
---
If you're interested in learning to raid, Raiders in Training is always looking for new trainees, as long as those have the drive to improve.
---
For those condi warriors that are reading this post, try to get power warrior geared too. It will help more than condi warrior in fractals with over 1k cc bar damage with maces and quick burst with axes
---
Congrats!
---
voice in the void.  1, it sounds cool.  2, there is no title I worked harder on.  My static and I spent months devoting some of our standard clear time to it.  Envoy's herald might have taken more accumulative time, but it is quite easy comparatively.
---
LG502, got my 6-0 skills bound to different mouse buttons and i have no idea how i used to play without it
---
&gt; try to get power warrior geared too
---
*Plays Power Berserker DPS in every group*
---
^^^It's ^^^actually ^^^really ^^^fun
---
Farming the rune by doing takes literally 30-60min (2 Fullruns) while doing it with PvP takes hours
---
Feels good to be effective, doesn't it?
---
WTF, how is this much damage even possible? 67k with soul spiral? Most I could every do was ~20k
---
Tribulation mode seems to have taken a lot of cues from Kaizo Mario (which, when translated, means "Asshole Mario") hacks, which included traps like invisible blocks that you jump into and end up dying by falling into a pit or being trapped and killed by another hazard not long after.
---
If you don't like Kaizo Mario hacks, you're not going to like Tribulation Mode.
---
Remove another already existing and presumably unpopular path.
---
I run Voice in the Void on my main, my chrono, because it's the only character I feel I play well enough to earn that title.
---
For my alts, I use a mix of titles according to flavor, titles that don't scream "hey look at me, the elitist" like Voice in the Void does. I use Hero of Lion's Arch, The Blazing Light, The Unclean, Leaves No Hero Behind, and Kingslayer, depending on flavor.
---
wtf o.o
---
Where did you find information that the name of the areas Opal Lake and Tugai Floodplains exists?  Also, Efanga Wilds etc..
---
Glorious Reward Track in case you want to work on The Ascension in the future (legendary PvP wings).
---
At first I thought he gave you 6.6k gold.
---
Nice parse, no matter what I do I can only get about 6-9k on the golem.
---
This is not your main account?
---
I was envisioning that you can flag up to participate in pvp or not by toggling the special action key. It could either be everyone for themselves or two main blood legion clans, like how Cantha has Luxon vs. Kurzick. The incentive to participate in clan skirmishes could be to progress certain achievements or masteries. If there ever would be a PvEvP in the Tyrian map for GW2, like the wilderness in runescape, it would be most appropriate in a charr region.
---
You could join the children in DR, but just don't be marjory!
---
Glad to you fun tonight. You'll continue to improve and we are happy to have you in TR :)
---
Scrolling down to the 6000 gold in your inventory really sells this image.
---
I use my tentacles
---
A less effective golem with range?
---
It's hard not to obsess over it when your groupmates are obsessing over it. :/ Honestly, I think ArcDPS is a great tool for improvement, but an even *bigger* tool for improvement would be more folks in the community who are willing to offer encouragement instead of hate when they see a groupmate doing poorly.
---
Sure, there are definitely people who don't want to listen to anything you say and don't care to improve, but there are also a lot of people who would probably like to contribute more, but don't even realize how much cooldowns and such can impact your performance. They're using their abilities correctly, but perhaps they're cancelling skills too early, or not quite getting the rotation right, or having trouble recovering when their rotation falters for whatever reason. There's absolutely nothing in-game to prepare you for the extra effort that's required to get truly good numbers, especially if you're graduating straight from open world leveling to fractals, so these people are really trying, but have no idea that they're not performing perfectly fine until you tell them... and if you tell them by saying "u suck, kys" how do you expect them to react?
---
There's nothing wrong with telling someone their numbers are low, or even kicking them if you want -- no one is obligated to play with anyone for any reason, after all. I just wish more people did it in a way that would encourage players to seek solutions instead of immediately trashing them and putting them in defensive mode. Poor communication skills do a lot more harm than poor gaming skills.
---
"I do not know why my team is losing 3vs4 mid point fight when I'm keeping the bunker on far busy!"
---
Fractal Goddess,since it costs 2,500 gold and it gives  +7% dmg in fractals XD
---
A poobadoo mount
---
&gt;free armor set FOR all the players
---
...why?
---
The fact that you need to put scare quotes around fixed suggests that the matter isn't fixed at all. The change from 5 to 10 also had absolutely no impact on fractal groups where a warrior is still normally desired.
---
I also didn't argue for removing banners. I suggested a degree of homogenisation - similar to what happened with Alacrity where we now actually have an alternative to Chronomancer. The same effect is brought but accessing it is entirely different. I'm not entirely sure why you decided to argue against a point I wasn't making.
---
Again, I'm not suggesting "zero unique" profession mechanics. The profession mechanics can be as unique as they want, they just shouldn't give access to incredibly powerful unique boons that can only be brought by one option. Keep the unique mechanics, the unique aesthetics, the unique gameplay and just share things like banner and spirit *effects*.
---
I’ve always been disappointed it’s not called “Fashionista”, because that would be my Mesmer go to in a flash.
---
Necros so bad they have to solo fractals.
---
But they can do it well.
---
YESSSSS!  The campiness and cheesiness of that game was awesome.
---
Nice job!
---
An actual event. Don't get me wrong, anniversary sales and birthday gifts are nice, but if you haven't played since day 1, you get pretty much nothing. And no, I wouldn't want to have birthday gift for free, it's just it would be awesome to have at least some special content with unique rewards. ESO is doing anniversary celebration extremely well despite their overall game design being subpar.
---
For what it’s worth, SAB had been dumbed down when it was patched so spikes would slightly protrude from the ground after activation. 
---
In the past there was no such indicator, it was all trial and error, followed by remembering the exact route according to minute details in the environment. 
---
I farmed both SAB infusions without Taco and IIRC completed W1 Trib before the changes to the spike. It’s not hard and I actually prefer not having any distractions (including the protruding spikes).
---
Yea, i got one of the highest APuhaving ppl in my blocklist, because he was so damn toxic. Also quite dumb lol
---
Nice my dude, keep up the good work and you'll be doing Raid CMs in no time.
---
Just wondering, would it technically be possible to acces the TP through your web browser if you knew the URL?
---
Same here, nothing in GW2 means as much dedication IMO.
---
I’d argue against any deletion. Level 11 is as new as it is. Like I can get from 1-11 in about half an hour. 
---
Just keep your toons and treat them as newly created ones. Mash your keys to find out what they do instead xD
---
“Any other Mouse users?” 
---
I hope you’re trolling
---
I understand why axe bursts aren't.  However, weakening charge on daredevil is also a movement skill but it is affected by quickness, so Anet is willing to make exceptions when movement skills are part of meta rotations (or some other rationale applies).
---
I wont agree with free armor sets for everyone.. just make an event like most games, stop asking for free stuff everytime.
---
+1 on Osano. He’s the only HP train commander  I follow because of his super professional and organised runs.
---
I know nothing about high level play or builds that are good, but this gives me hope that one day i can learn that shit. I play Soulbeast because it's a fun twist on one of my favorite classes, but i have no idea what to do with it otherwise.
---
The biggest signal to me that this guy is an idiot, is how that paragraph is written as one sentence.
---
Yes, there are periods near the end, but it's written like they are an after-thought.
---
&gt; Following the rules because they are the rules
---
Oh, you misunderstand.  We don't follow the rules because they are rules, we follow the rules because it's someone else's playground and we don't want to get kicked out of it.  Their house, their rules.  Trying to apply "if all your friends jumped off a cliff" to a video game with a clearly defined ToS is disingenuous *at best*.
---
Also, base jumping is a thing, and it's quite fun.  It's much more fun with friends.  So, you know, yes I would jump off a cliff with them in that situation, because I don't apply blanket platitudes to real life.  Life is not black &amp; white.
---
&gt; Think for yourself, please.
---
I did, and thought to myself "You know, I enjoy playing Guild Wars 2, and I don't enjoy being an asshole.  I'll just not do the things in their game that they don't want me to do, and not be a dick to my friends."  It's not that hard, people do it every day with markedly less drama than you're bringing to the table.
---
Seriously, grow the fuck up.
---
At reset, it's more likely you'll get a chance to capture a keep.
---
Instantly reminded of this hummingbird video somehow: https://twitter.com/VERYINTERESTlNG/status/1116121526305210368
---
Sadly already deleted the Guardian :(
---
No problem though, i'll just try some classes, relearn the basics and then switch to old toons I have.
---
Oh right, I didn't even think of that.
---
But when's the reset? Dailies reset at 2 am for me, and I have work at 6 am. Would need to do it on a weekend then.
---
Nooooo! Guard is my second love after Ranger :( 
---
Anyway welcome back to GW2 and hope you have a great time! :D
---
As someone that has a lot of chars, I would miss out on all the extra dye packs if this changed. No thank you, bad suggestion
---
Play on reset... If EU: **Friday 20:00 UTC+2** (roughly) — [World versus World](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_versus_World) reset for EU servers (the exact time varies from week to week) 
---
Other than that you will have more luck during prime time on the borderlands than EBG.
---
And completely disregard the commitment from the players that have spent 6 years in game and did earn the armour.
---
To me the opposite, my mains are Ele, Ranged and Engi :D
---
Thanks a lot, hope to stay regularly this time :)
---
Clean your inventory lol
---
I'd say it mostly comes down to the world 2 levels being so much longer too
---
I took a screenshot of his rating, can't remember by heart, but thanks to low pvp population sometimes it happens I get matched with low gold people too. So he is not necessarily plat. Highest bot I have seen was at 1550 rating
---
None, that's because there's not really a point of having a title in gw2. They most of the time don't mean anything. Maybe once I'll get Envoy's Herald I'll use it.
---
&gt;I sincerely hope that we receive an awesome armor set FOR all the players, not like the sixth anniversary that was only for users who turned 6 years old.
---
And where is my birthday gift then?...
---
Why should *you* get a free armor set, if *my* char turns 7?
---
Next question, what do you think should your char get on it's 7th birthday? I mean you would want a gift right? But you already got it this year. 
---
Next point, another armor set? We already got one last year. Or do you think it's fine, because some player don't have a 6 years old char? Ant what about those ppl who started around 1 year later? They would get 2 armor sets this year. Kinda meh, no?
---
Birthday gifts are for characters who have birthday. Giving everyone a gift on the first day chars birthday would be unfair, don't you think? 
---
If you want a birthday gift, you have to play the game for long enough (or just wait). I mean that's kind of a reward for those ppl/chars and you want to leech. Using the anniversary to ask for free stuff is the wrong way...
---
Salvage and exotic weapon and armour to unlock skin to wardrobe, delete any skins that are unlocked to wardrobe, use trans charges, delete dust and ore.
---
Hmm... I dont see that button anywhere in-game. :/ Am I missing something? I'd love to randomize!
---
Sweet T4 at Verdant Brink ...

bit of an odd statement there
---
What server are you on?
---
Far Shiverpeaks
---
Honestly I don´t understand why I get downvoted just because I represent a different view.
---
People just write things like "Pleeeease bring Cantha back"or "Give us Cantha!".
---
I just would not make such a big hype because in the end the disappointment could be great.
---

Structured PvP(heart of the mists) doesnt have gear progression.  
---
I assume you just dont have a build setup at all using the helmut icon at the top of your screen whennin heart of the mists.   
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6jjn8q/pvp_a_guide_from_how_to_get_started_to_how_to?sort=confidence   
---
There is a full guide to how to get started in PvP and some basic concepts around the game mode. The class specific examples are no longer fully updated but the info is still relevant otherwise. 
---
Feel free to ask if you have questions.
---
the compromise to make up for this change is to make character bound rewards stay as they are, e.g. dyes you mentioned, but account specific rewards, like backpacks, weapons and armor turn into  account related rewards.
---
I mean, they already did this, but in a very clunky way. you can get only 1 backpack per year, same for armor and 2 weapons per year. Meaning it's already semi-connected to accout.
---
In fact, April 31 is unlikely to happen.
---
i use 2 keyboards, cuz who needs mouse for flipping anyway
---
you may be right on this one, now that I think of it, since shift+key isn't required by the game to bind your keys, you can easily just bind skills to numpad and then assign them to mouse... yeah, nevermind, it's not the same as using multiple skills by 1 button, sorry for troubling you
---
F
---
A nice server, unfortunately I'm not on it, so I won't be able to help you.
---
Ghostly Hero on every char. Because I do care only about GW1 where achieving something was somewhat difficult. And it sounds awesome.
---
It's fine, I'll try again today at reset and if that fails, apparently eotm *does* work so I'll give that another shot as well.
---
&gt; Power DPS warrior is missing the burst and damage required for it to feel like a proper power DPS class. The class could do with some focusing of its traits and rebalancing of its damage. I'm eager to hear all your thoughts on the matter. 
---
As long as warrior retains its 100% guaranteed meta spot in any group as a hybrid support/dps, complaints about its viability as dps are unfounded. Might as well delete the 6 classes which aren't mesmer, ranger and warrior then.
---
Okay, how does one get affected by a multiboxer *that literally just afks* in a negative matter?
---
Haven't done anything HoT in a while. Is it that bad?
---
Right I was almost triggered.
---
It's probably still possible, but there are far fewer runs than in the past. Usally people come here for specific collections, daily Matriarch, and that's it.
---
You'd have to spend more time here to get a successful run.
---
Never knew power zerker was a thing.
---
Kingslayer because it was fun to get the title and it sounds really damn awesome. Only my Main, my Ranger, uses it tho cause he's the one that I played to aquire it. :D
---
Besides that Temporal Tourist because it was a pain in the ass to get. xD
---
Would really love to get my hands on raid titles as well someday. :D
---
&gt;Forg Beta Entry 11ZF9
---
What?
---
Lvl 80 dungeons are Fractals, they get updated and also we get new Fractals. Lvl 80 content, even different difficuties, proper rewards, special skins and so on. 
---
AR and gear requirement and "different mechanics" are really poor arguments against Fractals. 
---
How do you think would new dungeon paths look like? Like the old paths with their "just burst everything" "*mecanic*"? Look at Aetherpath, you would get the same kind of mechanics in those new paths as you get in Fractals now. 
---
Using AR as an excuse ist only for lazy ppl. Fractal Lvl 1-20 don't require any AR and still give good loot. You can get up to lvl 70 only with ascended trinkets, whose are pretty easy to get. 
---
Also gear requirement, If your gear is good enough for Arah and Aetherpath, it's good enough for Fractals. And nobody says you have to start with T4. There is a reason why there are 100 lvl. 
---
Actually Fractals provide a huge bunch of dungeon content, reject them only because you have to start from the beginning is... yeah, you shouldn't do that.
---
Rival 500 and ESDF keybinds, however, I mostly use the mouse for moving.
---
He should use /stuck
---
&gt; The value is in the fact they can sell you more skins.
---
Think realistic, they can sell as much skins as they want with only the 5 core mounts. They don't need to create new mounts for this. Look how much glider skins we have.
---
&gt;Warclaw actively made WVWing worse. 
---
That's just not true.
---
&gt;The skydrake just comes across as the ghetto griffon so far. Maybe it'll do a cool niche thing, but again it's completely unnecessary.
---
Aside from Raptor, Springer and Skimmer **ALL** Mounts are unnecessary. And still you never complained about Jackal and Griffon.
---
since im 80 and have unlocked elite specc Dragonhunter i don't seem to be able to choose that anymore as i could on low lvls
---
A great many achievements were not designed to age well... These always involve fighting champions who are a little too difficult to solo like djinn, some metas or almost any PoF bounty.  
---
The basic problem is that there are no other rewards tied to these mobs/events that make them really worth the time (these always also seem to be extra-tough mobs too) to stop and do for anyone who has already gotten their shiny item.  In a few cases these things are way off the beaten path too, so you aren't as likely to have others stop to help on their way through.
---
TIL. Shows what I know about WvW, and I've got roughly 3k hours on this game. My bad!
---
Fractal God, Envoys Herald and Dungeoneer. 
---
Because they are the only prestige titels you cant buy from sellers and actualy show the effort/time/skill/resources that went into optaining them.
---
I dont think Im going to disable my windows defender

You're right, in this game you either move with the swarm or you're left behind. Their current design is opposite to what they advertise. GW2 is not the game you can leave, come back year later and everything is fine. It won't be.
---
I've barely spent 2 hours in PvP, and hundreds in raids, so ... to each their own.
---
I am not sure what you are saying? You can't select the helmet icon? You need to be in heart of the mists to have it available.
---
Guild wars: Factions (battle isle preview weekend) was the day I started gw....
---
Loved it ever since
---
i actually use multiple depending on where im at with my progress with the character.
---
For example, at very start at lvl 2 ,i use volunteer , later on i use traveler and so on.
---
Considering the amount of titles i have and their "value" in this game (compared to their value in gw1) i figured out i can use to add a tiny bit more flavor to my character :)
---
&gt; Edit\* And for those that were asking, my average golem parse was about 22-24k, but I'll practice. 
---
It's a start but still a far cry from what it should be. Don't let up just yet. Now that you know, aim for the top.
---
That did not happen in the game...
---
The jade sea wasn’t turned to “ice” so will not melt or turn back into water.
---
It could however be the new bottom of the new jade sea if water levels rise in that 250yr gap.
---
It's not, at least optimally speaking. The nerf to the trait Berserker's_Power, that now only considers tier 1 for Berserker primal burst, was too much.
---
I try to match my titles with the theme of my looks. Like my order themed chars have appropriate titles, the Great Reformer or Light in the Darkness for general, Master of Secrets for Whispers, Professor or Storyteller of Orr for Priory and Stalwart or Avenger for Vigil.
---
Seems like you've learned one of the most important lessons of endgame in GW2: Know your class and don't just copy a build from a website. There are sadly a lot of people which think the one build will be fine for everything and which have no idea about switching traits and skills for different situations. Also I'm happy to hear that one more guy swallowed down his pride and actually was ready to improve himself based on the feedback he got. Thanks for not beeing a jerk and enjoy your clears (they make a lot more fun in a good group than soloqing^^).
---
April 1st is April Fools.
---
i would love some Heart of Thorns-like verticality.
---
I agree, I use copper for green and below, silver fore rare.
---
Exotic I use the black lion salvage kit,
---
DuAl sWoRd ThiEf 
---
Dualist, Privateer
---
I am still going to kick you if you have barely more DPS than the support renegade, regardless of your burst.
---
The other option is to go there in deep night. It means not many defenders, and there are sometimes sneaky small groups that try to sneakily flip undefended objectives. Even the T3s.
---
For the Rollerbeetle, that is easy to get, as long as you can beat few champions. People in maps still are interested to help with spider queen, and the beetle in silverwastes should be easy to do. Otherwise it is timegated a bit as you need some worldbosses on timer and Anomaly. Best for anomaly is to lookup the times and be on maps in advance, or get into some lfg group in advance. Not best to do at night.
---
For griffon, the main issue is to have 250 gold, but otherwise it is nice miniquest of collections and instances and open world exploration. If you like to climb stuff with your mounts, you will enjoy it :)
---
kinda a weird one, something noone will ever support but why not make a elite spec++. Basically next elite spec requires you to combine previous elite spec(s) with a new one. Why? I want a weaver with weapon swap, pistol offhand. Weavers gameplay is already imo the best ingame, bringing it to next lvl would just make it so much more cool. Casuals would probs hate it though. Or sage ele. The 4 attunements are changed to nature(arcane) light and dark magic.
---
I would pay for this.
---
Probably a dev only button for rapid testing, since they apparently don't do fashion.
---
Yea after checking again his run speed is definitely faster. So probably it's a tool that combines the script + speedhack.
---
Seems like a driver isue
---
That's impressive.
---
&gt;&gt; I don't enjoy being an asshole
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Also:
---
&gt;&gt; Seriously, grow the fuck up.
---
&gt;Even you don't succeed in following your own advice, so why should others?
---
What advice?  I didn't say don't be an asshole, just that I don't enjoy it.  I don't. I did say I shouldn't be a dick to my friends, but you're definitely not on that list.
---
Even if you were right about that one thing, invalidating one line of a post doesn't invalidate the entire argument.
---
Either way, you should grow the fuck up.
---
Not trolling at all.   
---
But, making a account six years before isn't "earning" anything.   You did nothing but make a account after all.  I know people who came back recently and got all the same rewards.  Did they "earn" it as well?
---
I'm nitpicking though as I do agree that it is a reward and if you want it you should just bid your time.
---
I have a servant who presses the buttons I tell him to. It's like having high ping irl.
---
I've played GW (1 and 2) since 2005 and do not recognize over half of these locations. Dafuq is this?
---
Ye, it was discovered couple of years ago:

---
To be fair, his Elder is dead, Aurene's isn't, so he had a right to say that line lol
---
Apart from dungeons this *was* the game at launch. There was zero content.
---
No. That's lame. We need new mount that can actually live and explore inside solid Jade.
---
I meant 1H Swords, not greatswords, but I appreciate the response.
---
Just a regular mouse with 2 buttons. All I need for skills is my keyboard. 1-5 for weapon skills, 6 for heal, F1-F4 for utility and elite, alt+1-5 for class skills.
---
Never needed any special gaming mouse, even for other MMO's where I had 2 or 3 skill bars. Everything on a keyboard.
---
Wait is this in-game? I haven't played in almost a year
---
What
---
Killer Queen on my character named Hot Space.
---
i like Queen.
---
And of course the two types of 20 scrolls that just don't stack
---
In what build do you use this rune?
---
Go eotm or borders. The issue is your an EB pug in a server full of eb pugs... flipping an enemy keep isn't exactly their forte. 
---
Eb keep cant really be flipped as long as the enemies race back from spawn on their mounts repeatedly. The only way to cap it is by being able to get inside, tank siege and constant respawn while killing the lord and the players non stop without much reinforcements. Your literally cant flip until you deplete the morale of the enemies because they can die, respawn and contest with mount indefinitely if they have 15 to 30 players, and in t1 usually they have 50+. Altho when they get farmed many will afk and leave because they are leeches.
---
In fact your best chance on eb would be taking back your own eb keep after another server takes it from you... this does happen especially outside of primetime due to coverage differences.
---
Eotm and borderlands have more keeps that are easier to cap. Get out of eb and you'll have an easier time capping a keep. Bay and hills are also often not t3, making them easier to get  into and often less defended. Easiest is not upgraded bay or hills on fsp bl. Your ppt players generally flip those quickly even without a tag.
---
You can get the flip on a keep by killing the outside guards (well any guards), as long as someone else flips it for your team.
---
Yes
---
Yes, but the track gives you also lots of other kinds of loot, and its not so dependent on having people available as much as it is in dungeons nowadays. It is not that hard to find ppl on lfg for the dungeon, but its not that easy either. And i think that you need more than 2 fullruns to get the 6 pieces of the set. But even if it is enough, there is always the downtime while you wait for a new group to form as in pvp it takes like 3-4 min max to get into a match.
---
YOU'RE ALIVE :D
---
I would like a flying turtle skin  too!
---
You have a point on the people that came back after a long break to be fair. I have been playing for some time, but I did start 6 months later than the game release. So when all my friends get their shiny new stuff in August I have to wait until the following Feb.  But this is just something I have to deal with and I would never expect a system to be changed "because I'm missing our or have to wait longer"
---
Based on what you said about taking breaks, the system could be improved, maybe not to reward length of a character but input into the game, but I don't know how.  My input into the game is shown by AP I guess, but that's a sore subject too.
---
The problem is no matter what system is used there will always be someone that wants what other people have and want it all now and handed to them easily, I can't have everything in the game, either due to me "can't do it (like Dhum CM for example)" or me "can't be arsed doing it (like some WvW achieves for example)", but that's fine by me, I have accepted that it limits me I can't have everything.
---
It's one of the pricier ones, 2000 gems/$20 USD. But given this is a totally new model, with a new rig, animations and shader effects, I guess you could justify the price.
---
A lot clearly went into this chonky boy.
---
I have a McDonalds inspired character called "Free Candy In The [Van] and my title is "Mini Collector" for obvious reasons.
---
&gt; Hey guys, idk if i'm supposed/allowed to write this post here
---
That one is easy to determine by one look to the right:
---
&gt; Please do not
---
&gt; - Exchange items (Sell/Buy/Donations).
---
Yeah I don't understand how hammer is still worse than mace/mace for cc in PvE. But I thinks it's not too far behind.
---
Should've just called it C H O N K B I R B
---
No, the Animator seems to be still at Anet: https://www.artstation.com/scottdickey
---
Samantha is a character artist, meaning she created the 3d model of the bird, not the animation.
---
My experience is from Gandara/Underworld only. It's complicated and people are more ambivalent, which I guess makes it good.
---
It makes movement and access to fights easier. Attrition still applies, because it usually won't help even if the fight is at Bay/Hills and your spawn is across the map. It helps if your zerg is on the north side of a map, you die, and it takes forever to trudge back.
---
It also helps with random roamers wanting to gank if you're not into that stuff. I'm not into roaming so it hasn't impacted me negatively. To me zergers are inherently disadvantaged in a roamer fight, which makes it easily exploitable. One people having fun is not my kind of fun.
---
But if you get an advantage, so does the enemy. The not-so-good is the ability to make a surprise charge into a zerg, so you need to develop new tactics or die quickly. But that's what a changing meta should be about, so the grumbling at the beginning is a given. 
---
You can dismount people with a well-placed Rev hammer #2 without even full stacks of Might, so it's not invincible.
---
I like MH dagger on ele for heal tempest. Its not a super popular build yet, but its not bad as it can heal for a lot and still provide tons of boons. And you pretty much want WH for boon tempest, so what MH alternative do you have? Only scepter, but that seems inferior to dagger.
---
There a lot, based on what you looking for, you can check twitch streamers they have great communities. Some for raids other for social interaction ^^
---
The Blazing Light because as a holosmith that is literally my job.
---
Its super odd that axe, which consistently got buffed over and over, is still not really a good weapon outside of using axe2 every now and then when it lines up with the rotation.
---
Ok
---
So far all I found to be pretty viable is [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Scrapper\_-\_Med\_Kit\_Scrapper](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Scrapper_-_Med_Kit_Scrapper) with a few modifications.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOps-hY4hM
---
you can be the judge of that. I just like the yellow cuz its funky and it grows on you haha.
---
There's no way to make a truly fair system, but I find having to wait until some anniversary to be obnoxious.
---
"Here's a cool new weapon set."
---
"How can I earn one?"
---
"You wait three and half more years."
---
"..."
---
That just sounds like they want me to quit playing and come back in three and a half years.
---
Welcome back to GW2 ^^
---
Take your time, there is a lot to do, you can do the first mission in PoF to get the raptor mount as it will be easier and faster to do everything. 
---
Hope you have fun and enjoy it, and let us know if you have any question we can help you with
---
Cheers
---
Cool screenshot! Are you using any kind of reshade/sweet fx ?
---
no i didn't edit to change wording just for grammar and format.
---
if you had pugs that did prestack as a support then they're experienced and it's prolly tier 4. lower tiers more likely to be clueless to meta -- in my experience.
---
Untag me!
---
I'd love seeing main hand scepter + shield on Ranger. 
---
Scepter auto attack 180 range, 3 hits max 3 targets, 3rd hit applies blind, #2 skill 900 range Line that applies cripple 2s if crossed + reflects projectiles 6s duration 15s cd, #3 skill 900 range AOE, 8 hits on max 5 targets - does spike damage + torment 20s cd. Shield #4 450 range sends out a 180 degree AOE shockwave that hits 5 targets - does medium damage and taunts all targets hit for 1s, 25s cd, #5 creates a shield made of wines around the caster and 2 other allies within 240 range that reduces damage taken directly and from conditions for 33% for 6s with a 30s cd.
---
Yeah but noone here talks about t3. Its a big shithole down there
---
Thank you! I'm using Gw2 Hook with my own preset 😊
---
Yakslapper.
---
  
---
He slaps yaks.
---
Aw classic.
---
\&gt; Also "saving" such a dragon without further plan was just stupid as hell.
---
It was the only choice we had. Let the world be destroyed now, or let it survive and hope we can figure something out later. Lesser of two bad choices.
---
Dps rotation on golem doesn't mean anything, whether you hit bench or not. If you call that easy it doesn't hold any value in real raids because for example the reason you listed already, daredevil is maybe easy because it used 4 buttons on golem, but maximizing the damage is one of the hardest
---
It's pretty easy to find a group, did you try? Took me 5-10 mins each time, and all groups were extremely skilled and experienced.
---
Alright, thank you!
---
Its pretty damn easy though if you have decent experience with the encounters. First sama pull I did on the class was 16.6k and the first sloth was 18k (would have been 20 if one of the chronos wasnt like afking all fight and actually pulled...) class isnt rocket science
---
if your group is not able to phase or kill the bosses within the burst timeframe you are in the wrong group
---
If this isn't a master troll shit post then I don't know what is....
---
I prefer not displaying any titles
---
I've always dreamed of a shaman ranger too. But I always imagined it would use a sceptre, and rather than working with the typical elements (earth, air, water, fire - which is the domain of the elementalist), it would work with the 'element' of nature - sort of like a plant bender/summoner.
---
I mean if the benchmark was "What class is the least reliant on others to perform" Necro (Reaper in particular) wins by a country mile.
---
This is extremely impressive. And the guy is clearly a master at Reaper, and I'd love to have him in my party anytime.
---
But that's not the benchmark. And with a full party and supports, Reaper still falls behind every other Power DPS class currently. I'll admit to being ignorant to how good Reaper's burst is, but if they're lacking burst, that's also not great for CMs in particular.
---
This isn't evidence to suggest Reaper is a Tier 1 class in a typical T4/CM/Raid scenario. It's just not. It's Tier 2. Usable/viable, absolutely! But sub-optimal. Which is fine.
---
Don't get me wrong though, I'm not taking anything away from this. This is still absolutely amazing and deserves all the praise it's getting. It just shouldn't be treated as something it's not.
---
Unconfirmed.
---
Actually specifically said he sucks at those. :^)
---
Ye
---
Well, so far they are offering living world 4, maybe in the future they would do the same with 2 and 3.
---
But if you are invested into the game I would get them for sure, they are a lot of fun and a lot of more content. Plus it has some items that would be easier to get to upgrade your trinkets to ascended ^^ just keep a look on the black lion trade store, they usually offer them as a bundle for cheap price.
---
So far, I would hold on living world 4 as they been offering them every week, 
---
If there is anything I don’t like in the game it would be the game marketing, half of the things I just come across it by chance here on Reddit or word of mouth from a friend in game.
---
So didn’t think of it?
---
Kind of? It depends on what shaders and effects you decide to use. Some have a big impact on the peformance and others don't really. You'll just have to see for yourself when you try it out 🙂
---
It has the highest flat condition duration plus 175 Condition damage.
---
It's to heavily invest in Conditions as yur sole damage type.
---
I forgot many things, but like I said, it was just a start to help. ^^
---
Dedication? No, they have that title because they grinded a lot.
---
22-24k isn't great, but it's pretty respectable.  Plenty of room for improvement down the road.  It's always rough accepting that you're not as good as something as you think you are.
---
I use The Archdesigner just because I think it sounds great for Asura.
---
&gt; Joined a PUG group from \[TR\] tonight, who were apprehensive doing 99CM  and T4s with 'that guy from Reddit' but this time I did manage to stay  above the support classes! And actually joined the guild so I can start  doing more runs with regular, static groups so I can continue improving 
---
Good job! Thats impressive, some of the guys you ran with were my former static!!! Very elitist kick happy people, so thats quite a feat! I heard they be looking for a DPS maybe you can replace me!!! (Just be sure to GG if the leader dies, he wont hesistate to keep calling you trash while you carry him though siax CM because hes dead for the whole last phase omeglul)
---
Nice to see that youre still playing ary :D thought you were dead
---
Looks horrible. That isn't what a shrine maiden wears.
---
Your attempt to undervalue what is clearly subjective and means a lot to some players is noted.
---
Keep in mind that scholar are optimal for raid and fractal runs as you can be expected to have more than 90% hp. Ogre runes have the same stats but no 5% dmg modifier. Flame legion are pretty good for holo and weaver due to the burning they apply, plus even in open world you are almost always guaranteed to get the % modifier as you constantly apply burning. Eagle runes are okay but they give you precision which you don't need unless you have no fury or are low on hp (which should not be the case in instanced content).
---
oh i didint know!
---
til getting better at the game is called elitism, this is why the word has no meaning anymore lmao
---
It was... like 3 years ago.
---
If applied this to an autohotkey macro i wonder wut would be the delays between keys...
---
Add me in game, I'll be on most of tomorrow and maybe later tonight! :D
---
So Skill 1 -&gt; 1.23 sec -&gt; Mount Dash + Leap of Faith? 
---
or maybe another lil delay between Mount Dash and Leap of Faith?
---
It's a beautifully designed and animated mount skin, but am I the only one (as the owner of a parrot) that finds it weird where your character sits on it? It's like right at the top of the tail, where there would be 0 support on a bird lol! I guess it's the limitations of the skimmer mount model itself rather than this particular skin, but it would have looked a lot better to see the player sitting higher on its back, with their legs behind the wings or cross-legged.
---
Ritualist for Revenant plis anet
---
You did an amazing job Samantha - especially on those idle animations!
---
Magnificent (indeed) Hummingbird, Summit Wildhorn, Shrine Jackal, Tremor Armadillo and Grand Lion are my best choices for mount skins and some (Summit, Grand Lion, Humming, Tremor) IMO should be the default ones
---
Hell yeah, I hope he does a giveaway of his build
---
&gt;While you state there are no differences, that does make you wonder why 3/4 of the people that actually do the effort of tagging up demand otherwise. 
---
Makes me wonder indeed. But then again, when I look at my DPS meter, I always - and I mean *always,* regardless of what I am testing, wish for more. Sometimes you have to take a step back and gotta say "good enough is good enough", otherwise you only stress yourself without any real need.
---
Of course I realize, that you cannot expect a well trained squad of optimal composition. Usually, though, a change of behavior will also bring great success. Like a week back we were struggling with an enemy zerg,. Couldn't beat them,  until our comm ordered a group of casters to veer off to the side and go in from the flank.
---
And what do you know? It worked. Change of behavior &gt; change of squad composition.
---
Another time, we were running with a squad against an opposing garrison. And it was a disaster, but our comm was persistent. We went there, had our siege destroyed, went to the towers and camps, slowly drained their resources, went there again, and each time we pushed a little bit farther, each push was a little harder.  
---
When we first went inside, the primary goal was not to fight the people inside. The first goal was to destroy their siege. When we came back for the second time inside, we finally got the garrison.
---
And I have made that very experience again and again, and again. This is one of the primary reason, I don't believe in this whole "meta is life, meta is all". Behavior and strategy is more important than the composition.  
---
That is *not* to say, that you can do completely without the meta classes. That's probably gonna be very difficult. But from what I can see there are always players around, who do meta classes and offer healing, booncorruption, boons and area effects. The zerg might not always have the otpimal number of firebrands, but in my experiences, this does not pose an insurmountable problem.
---
I also don't think anyone really "carries" the others. We help each other, each in our own way. This whole mentality of accusation and leeching, I just don't get it. I probably lack the right mindset for that kind of thinking - but then again, if that breeds toxicity, I am not sure "right" is the proper word to use in this context.
---
Eagle is only good if you need it to cap crit tbh
---
Tourist rule #1: Never share your secret spots.
---
Now we all have to go there with vuvuze&amp;ndash;, I mean, Marriner's Horns, and ruin the spot for you.  
---
That's rule #2: If someone shares with your their secret spot, spread it around and go there en masse to ruin it.
---
it used to be 4 nightmare and 2 trapper runes to condi cap a scourge in viper gear, it used to do a lot of damage, but now zerker reaper is where its at
---
I love this, how many people have you managed to piss of so far?
---
Closer to the Stars is the most beautiful sounding title to me. I really need to go back to GW1 to get it.
---
From toxic casual to starting the road to improvement, you'll go far op.
---
What about Shing Jea Monastery?
---
Kind of expected but thanks for trying.
---
Ele with rifle. After seeing/reading Youjo Senki all I need in my life are mages with rifles. :D
---
&gt; since it is bot
---
Yes, I'd agree with you that multiboxers should be banned if they even *use* bots, but multiboxing requires **next to zero** effort in the first place. So going through the trouble of using a bot and risk getting banned doesn't make sense. And it certainly can't be compared to bots in PvP since that's something else entirely.
---
&gt; dump prices down
---
How high do you want them to be? You seem like a TP baron which is odd, considering that I'm sure they multibox too.
---
Then it wouldnt be Twitch friendly xD
---
You dont stress but the comm gets flamed, not followed or not listened to as soon as fights go south.
---
You say changes in attitude are more important but let's be honest, you have no idea what you're on about. You're completely new and your experiences are limited to very low end. If your squad comp is bad you're going to get hard trolled by decent groups even much smaller than yours as soon as you come out from under then siege spam gandara is known for. That's the truth.
---
So you already admit you will never ever contest decent groups. These decent groups are also just pug groups with comms. They simply expect and demand more from themselves and their players to improve together.
---
My experience on dps meters on all three servers currently in t1 is that most players are exceptionally bad. They dont grasp the basics. Their builds, positioning, skill usage and coordination is all bad. This is the norm in this game in 2019. You say small explanations make a huge difference, but so do 2 or 3, out of 50+, actually decent players who understand what their role is and can play it. And truthfully, I dont think you know why your team does or doesn't win a fight.
---
So if some players and commanders would rather play with less players but more reliance on proper organisation and teamwork, then good for them. Unfortunately, that invites lots of random leeches to spam their buttons and pretend they're winning because their team wins without them. Only way to get rid if these players is toxicity and elitism.
---
Some outfits would just not work as seperate armour pieces, but that doesn't change the fact that Anet releases way too many outfits compared to how little armour sets they put out.
---
I guess it's too much off a hassle to develop six seperate pieces that go well together for every weight class.
---
Seeing the upcoming ritualist outfit, I am sad its not a set of armor.
---
&gt;And finally: "Avatar" inspired elementalist brawler. Using a main hand and off hand focus as gauntlets for a martial art-esque move set.
---
Or even cooler: No weapon. If you have no weapons equipped you get 5 "fist skills". You gain stats based on your armor. (For example if you're wearing an bersi armor you gain the attributes a two handed ascend bersi weapon would provide.)  
---
Since the new elite specializations tend to reinforce a certain aspect and take something away (Holo loses his F5, for example), the avatar is characterized by the fact that his attunements have only 1 sec cooldown (like Engi Kits) and his "weapon skills" cause extremely high base damage, but you lose the ability to adapt ypir playstyle, as you can no longer use weapon sigills.
---
I use **Finders Keepers** on my character [Kleptomaniac Kayyia](https://imgur.com/qFyHEiC)

Free the nipple! ^:P
---
I used 150 keys on the last box, I got 3 "Rare" drops in total and they all were the shity cavalier skins...
---
I like the idea of an epic journey to “tame” all the ranger elite spec animals, culminating in using all of their mechanics to unlock the elite in a final battle.
---
Holy shit are those the old transmutations?!?!
---
Just take the vine bridge
---
On his LinkedIn it says he worked at Anet during July 2008 – February 2019, so...
---
What are those 7 and 8 icons skills
---
Also a Rare drop from the current Black Lion Chest
---
Tbh I like outfits. Wedding Dress, Cook's Outfit, Common Clothing. Which outfits would you even want as armor pieces?
---
Speaking of things I didn’t come across without word of mouth. You said they’re giving away LWS4 for free? How do I get it? I’ve been logged in and haven’t noticed an unlock
---
Pretty sure there's only one race-class combo that has any sort of significance. There's a meme WvW build that uses a Norn racial elite skill with a Soulbeast to one-shot enemies from stealth. But outside of that, literally 0 difference. Don't feel bad if you didn't make this class, that's honestly such an edge case don't worry about it.
---
Long time ago but they will be sending the mask later.
---
its on the gem store, you go there and you will find it on the front page
---
Heck yeah. Thanks my dude
---
I know tons of people who have made 5+ years without spending a cent outside of the cost of the game and expansions.  Basically don't try to speak for everybody, you usually end up wrong when you do it.
---
"Keg Master" on my main thief not only because I like the name but also because not a lot of people got thisone.
---
You're a pug that get upset they got booted out of squad and not follow a raid.
---
How do you think leading 50+ players with all their own desires goes? You think reports do anything in this game? You think it matters knowing those same players will still follow wherever you go because they want a comm and almost nobody wants to deal with pugs? X D
---
But only male-presenting nipples, just like Tumblr.
---
You cannot report players for being bad. You can report them for harrasment, though.
---
Usually there is an event when you have to kill the modern below the way point. Many areas in the game are locked behind events.
---
Oh damn you are right. I forgot about those enemies.
---
I recently re-activated my 7 year old account as well; when they asked for the serial code I thought I was screwed.  I checked everywhere in my gmail and couldn't find it.  Until I did a search for GW2 and it magically popped up.  I have no idea where this email is saved in my gmail, I can't find it without doing a search lol.  
---
Try doing a search in your email :P  If you can't find it I'm sure support would be willing to help though.
---
And nothing of value would be lost.
---
Yeah tell good guilds that rely on cooperation to play a single player game because role players need to be carried and gw2 is for casuals only... meanwhile they play mass team based pvp as if it's a single player...
---
All play styles must be accepted as long as you play casual and bad. Reeeeee.
---
Good players can carry very well. Its just that carrying trash isn't fun, for the good players. Very fun for leeches that feel rewarded for killing any players regardless of gameplay. It heavily limits your options and mobility and usually makes fights stupidly snowbally and one sided.
---
Again, all I want is the option to play without certain people that dont share our pov. Why can I not tag for the players I wanna tag for rather than the entitled demanding idiots that expect everything in the game to be just for them? 
---
You'll notice in a few weeks. Without TLS gandara has no.comms. depending on relink the chances of losing much of your fights, commanders and players is quite high. Wouldn't be the first time.
---
You could download your driver set again and do a fresh install. I know AMD and Nvidia do that. I would like to say its guild wars assassins creed where you are reliving memories of your character. lol.

Anything but Cantha is fine by me.

Only good for male toons though... Sadness that my Norn Female must still cover her fabulous body art with default undergarments.

I honestly don't think they can outdo Sunrise so I just try not to expect much.

For my Jason Vorhees cosplay character I use Unhappy Camper.

From top to bottom:

A paladin - The Blazing Light

My main character which saved the world countless times, has killed dragons, came back from the dead, killed a god, etc - Eternal Gladiator

A flamethrower Norn engineer who's secretly a TF2 pyro - The Demolisher
---
An Ace of Illusions, became famous for his cancerous shit in pvp - Illustrious Legend
---
A deadeye in a "camo" - Mercenary

Fire/Water smartass elementalist - Professor
---
Ranger who's actually a ranger and respects nature - Knight of the Thorn
---
Revenant - Mistwarden (This one kinda goes without saying)
---
Huge Norn necromancer metalhead - The Tormentor
---
Unless it takes your 3 hours to get the spike maze part in Z3.
---
For me the most beautiful set is luminous one, for shiny characters.
---
I also love Warden Greatsword for my nightmare courtier reaper.
---
I find most blacl lion sets overdone - too big, too shiny. Fine for screenshots but really stupid to look at them during fights.
---
I'm in general more on realistic side or at least toned down shiny (something like Thor in Ragnarok/Infinity War - shiny, but not too much).
---
In fact, game model is B2P with free access to core game. So calling this game free is not accurate.
---
why should i even play the game if i just have to buy the weapons on the market?
---
create a level 1 character, spend 20 euros on gems, convert them into gold and buy the skins. such a fun way to play GW2.

You keep telling me pugs can do and play whatever they like, while there is no place for guilds and vet players. Yet wvw has always, always relied on these guilds and vets to provide commanders, community events, ... for their pugs.
---
Back when gw2 wasnt for entitled casual trash, pugs understood that sometimes guilds would raid as guilds and sometimes they be open. Some raids are forneveryone, and some raids arent. And people accepted these other play styles. It also meant less good comms would get players.
---
Nowadays you have people like you, saying all classes MUST be accepted in all open  raids, and this isn't a game fir guilds or non casual play styles. That s surprisingly elitist and toxic, but you dont realise it. Yet you get upset when people treat you the same way you treat them. Meanwhile people insist on following the group that gets the best results while selectively ignoring everything they disagree with. And they pretend they're friendly and nice team players.
---
This is this wvw is fucked and toxicity is increasing everywhere. I never said all comms should play meta only. I said they should be allowed to, as they wish, to run their squad. You say all comms that lead open must do it how you see fit, and fool yourself into believing you're nice.
---
 
---
The selfish entitled demands of new and casual players are entertaining but mostly fuck themselves. Because most of the chill and casual comms were the first to leave, due to not being able to do their thing anymore.
---
Here, take my downvote.
---
To be fair though. Even though I did take forever to get W2 down the first time. W2 generally has less trap concentration than W1.
---
It just doesn't help that they make you do parts that were already annoying pre-trib.
---
Make legendary weapons, best effects in the game. End of story.
---
You can always play a game that has a monthly subscription of \~15 bucks  
---
or you can craft the most beautiful weapons in game which are Legendary weapons.
---
Draganblood weapons are gorgeous tbh, and those are very recent.

get your gym selfies out of my Tyria
---
This is very much a thing! It's been a while since I read up on it, but iirc, Viking Berserkers would wear nothing but an animal skin in the belief that the skin would give them said animal's strength. I'm sure there are tons of instances in other cultures of warriors doing similar things too, I know the Celts did something similar as well.
---
Combat effectiveness might be debatable, but I'm sure there was a good bit of psychological warfare involved. Idk about you, but I'd be pretty terrified if a big ass, bearded Viking came at me, dong flopping in the wind, with a greataxe and wearing nothing but a bear skin.
---
less than 10% of the gw2 population raids....don't think suggesting these as "in game" is misleading???
---
Well sure, but GW2 is not the kind of game to gate shiny skins behind 'challenging' content. It is not a hardcore MMO, not even a raid-driven MMO. More like a casual MMO with the occasional hard content if that's your thing.
---
Plus, its economy is intentionally gold-driven so gold is bound to get you almost everything the game has to offer. Including everything that can be bought for real money except for the game itself and its expansions.
---
Both of these points are design decisions and will most probably not change. They are part of what makes GW2 GW2.
---
(Raids do have a number of exclusive skins though, including Legendary Armor. That you apparently find them all ugly is unfortunate.)
---
If the game revolves around you getting that weapon set then maybe you SHOULD consider quitting.

---
Alright, that's funny.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special_Forces_Training_Area
---
worth noting that this is pve only; in pvp and wvw you want your conditions to hit hard fast and duration becomes irrelevant because of cleanses (especially so in zvz, where no one runs condi builds because they just get insta cleansed by the rest of the zerg)
---
Yes please.
---
&gt;If pure has even fights with another guild, gandara pugs will add and tilt the fight into pure favour even if they ask them not to. This I follow whoever attitude is very strong on gandara.
---
This is also, because the game mode contrary to your belief, is not tailored to what you seem to expect. You throw around "entitlement", but consider reality:
---
There is zero protection for these fights from outside interference, which already shows that this game mode is not made for what you seek. Doing it despite this is literally entitlement.
---
Commanders show up prominently on map. Where they are, action is. Players go where action is. Not expecting this to happen is denying reality. Sounds like entitlement to me.
---
I usually do not see any notice on map chat not to interfere, because something special is going on. What are players supposed to do? Read minds? Over a distance? Without knowing the actual target of the telepathy attempt? ;)
---
technically with no ferocity then the ferocity is a greater % gain as long as good crit chance... and theres grieving builds; though only really firebrand and they prefer other runes (even my jank greiving thief and ranger prefer other runes)
---
How does that last checkpoint change things? So by the time you've gotten to Betty it's too late? D=
---
wait, you can get it with the skeleton or did you rig it yourself?
---
For all slots. Seriously if they aren't going to add anything remotely resembling shorts into the game then let my male characters run around in their boxers.
---
they're utter bullshit, but I found a workaround. I now don't try to jump from the next one without pausing. If I keep jumping, ok, I go on the next platform. If I don't (50% of the time it works everytime), I jump on place on the platform once then go on the next one.
---
I use flame legion on some characters. It is fine most of the time but it's annoying when you run into some of the burning immune mobs in the game.
---
Only a truly fearless Norn would dare approach Jormag in their boxers.
---
rezzing people for the mark y golem wrong?

been rezzing people at destiny's gorge for a while now but still no recording. yes i do have enough recording devices

BOOOOOOOOO get out commie.

You must be close to Gwamm then why not go back and get it :) go here to check what you need if interested. https://hom.guildwars2.com/en/#page=welcome

Because then if you fall off the world and/or die you're returned to that checkpoint, and you're unable to backtrack. I thought I'd get all the baubles without reading Dulfy's guide only to find that one out. Whoops!
---
&gt;Recipes. Use even if you don't have the crafting profession, they're available across all characters
---
Wait what? Since when has that been a thing? That's amazing!
---
haha just FYI, it's not called Marmoset -- that's the name of a rendering program that ZBrush artists typically use. If you scroll down to the second image, it says "Substance's IRay renderer." That's a different program as well. The creature is called "Guardian of Secrets."
---
Either Killer Queen or Leaves No Hero Behind. The later mostly so I don’t have to ping KP for fractals.

I want long range heavy hitting mage style magicballz with cc and teleports...

That's exactly how everyone looks while riding it!
---
Good summary of issue with warrior.
---
Warrior is missing build with big burst other professions can do (dragonhunter, soulbeast, holosmith, thief, etc).
---
People usually say that warrior as bannerslave has its guaranteed spot in both raids and fractals, thus is "ok" which is a bit ignorant.
---
Berserker has the potential to become bursty competetive power DPS spec for PvE. 
---
But there is also issue, how to buff power berserker without making it also much better and improved version of current power core bannerslave. Because as it is now with condition dps bannerslave (dps build with just banners in utility slots), same could happen if they simply buff power berserker. One thing is to do that via rage utility skills. Maybe they could count as physical skills, too. Their damage and usage should be very significant and important for high burst dps rotations, so power berserker warrior can't just take banners instead of signets and be improved version of current power core warrior bannerslave.
---
It is not so easy to figure out without breaking something :D
---
Jormag is the one who would fear the Norn in boxers!
---
self-rigged. Or rather, via website. https://www.mixamo.com/#/
---
All you need is an obj./fbx and then you can auto-rig it there
---
For a norn who isn't afraid of catching a cold, is truly the worse enemy to be had
---
I just did it this year on infantile and I scoured the entire area trying to find a way back. Even attempting to scale the clouds to see if there was a path back that I missed. No such luck unfortunately.
---
There is a path back high up above the bell, but that requires you to have taken the shortcut eagle.
---
If he hadn't it already installed his game would crash each time he sees anything from the expansions.
---
Considering there's absolutely nothing to even give a *hint* about accent, I'm going to say yes.
---
Weaver, dragonhunter, holosmith.
---
Hell, just have hide options for all armour pieces.  Go into battle skyclad!
---
&gt; Combined with the other trait where fear increases the damage of other conditions that are ticking alongside it, fear duration becomes unholy in terms of condi-DPS for several reasons
---
That trait didn't work like that and no longer does anything like that. 
---
It increased the damage that Fear did if there were other conditions not the other way around. It was changed so it did the higher damage regardless.
---
Sounds like you've not gotten to play with power dps much yet, so that could be a thing! You're gonna get different answers from every person about what class is fun to them though.
---
Wiki as a bug listed as not verified but that could be worth a shot
---
&gt;This can only be obtained by the character who bought the recording device.
---
Then make sure you have a recording device on you (I know, I know, but just in case tripple check, similar mistakes have been made at some point).
---
Then just in case I would try to to rez at least 1 actual player instead of a NPC (again as a just in case check).
---
Is the build shown anywhere I didn’t realize reaper had this much dmg now I heard it was better but damn
---
Friendly FYI: F6/PrintScr keys are default for taking in game screenshots. They will be placed in your User/Documents/Guild Wars 2 folder.

Only you can prevent phone pictures of monitors!

Not since they gave you pips for losing, there is no real encouragement to even try in PVP.
---
Using a guide is for babies.. but anet plz make this easier for me because I can't remember the routes and keep falling for the same traps
---
A scepter-using shaman ranger would be amazing, I love this.
---
Ehhh...no, thanks.
---
Nightmare runes have a total 20% duration not 10%
---
zomg, this. Everything goes much easier if veterans actually explain mechanics. 
---
If the mechanics aren't the problem, open up by *asking* if the person wants your input. Getting a "no" in that case just means you're probably not going to reach them anyway, but it comes off as less obnoxious.
---
we already have invisible bra,so i dont see issue.
---
there is only one client version at any given time. not owning certain content simply locks you out of accessing the related parts in game.
---
nonetheless the client/installation folder size can vary depending on your language settings and (to a small degree) the addons you use. in my case it's 45.3GB which to my knowledge is on the higher end of the spectrum.
---
It is completely irrelevant anyway since it all comes down to personal preferences.
---
Reminds me of the guy who made it a point to whisper me when trying out a ranger not to use my #4 as it's a knock back and hits them out of aoe. Then proceeded to send me a gold, and was like "remember, no #4" being super patronizing. I was just killing random crap to see if I liked the character. Mind your own fucking business people!
---
I think you mean unlock a full set and make a 50g profit.
---
It’ll be fine.
---
when i don't want my focus skin to stand out much i go for jailbroken or dragonsblood focus
---
Ah I misread the tooltip. Makes sense as a way to give it soft intensity increase
---
That makes sense. Thanks!

Thank you &lt;3
---
I've always disliked how *covering* male armor is.
---
Let me make my boy look like a stripper like the female armors do &gt;:v
---
There's no break bar on SB though.  Why were they shouting to CC it?
---
BL weapons are ridiculous. The best weapons skins are the ones that are realistic or from GW1, like the Gladius (Honor of Humanity).
---
You gotta pay for something. I'd rather have the skins and other fashion items be the most expensive than have to pay a subscription or pay more for content. Keep the cheap/free content and expensive fashion wars. Better than any other MMO out there.
---
As far as I know, we don't know. Or at least, I've heard enough conflicting stories that I doubt there's one definitive answer.
---
So you are complaining that people that don't want to do challenging content can look nice aswell? or just not as nice? I mean, if you don't have a problem with gold what is the point of the post to begin with?
---
Tbh, I personally find most BL weapons really boring or directly ugly, and I think the vast majority of the good skins are only obtainable in game outside gemstore. 
---
Many of the raid skins looks fantastic, aswell as dungeon and fractal skins. Stating that the only good skins have to be bought is a false statement because it's entierly subjective.
---
In a comment you stated that you would be buying gems to convert them to gold and then buy a skin, heavily suggesting that you have issues getting gold. If your point was enabling people being credit-card warriors, so what? It does not give them any advantage in game over other players and it supports the game. Litterally every other mmo also does this, even the ones with sub. fees.
---
Regardless of you having gold or not, you have to argue why being able to buy a skin from the tp is bad. If it is inherently bad using something one havent "earned", should i feel bad for eating then because i did not grow the food? Should I feel bad for dressing myself in the morning because I didn't make the clothes?
---
No, ofc. not! I earned that by earning money and buying the product. Why should it be any different in GW2? Furthermore, is there *really* any meaning to "earning" the weapon in game? The rest of us don't know if you payed anyone to carry you through the challenging content that you got it from.
---
If you know this for a fact, feel free to release your sources and numbers as proof. Otherwise, you’re stating assumptions and guesswork as fact.

---
I use that little cup that you get from Xera, I believe.
---
Been there, done that b/c after 6+ years that's generally how I feel when I do things in GW2.
---
 **Attended macro use is permitted as long as it is not exploitative, and as long as it does not provide the user with an unfair advantage over other players** 
---
Here are few common macros that are allowed in the game:
---
* You **may** bind dodge and jump to a single key.
---
* You **may** create an auto-clicker that opens or consumes a stack of items.
---
Arguably, this may be considered one action, as the result you're looking for is one thing, not multiple actions being strung together to be an advantage
---
I doubt this would be  as bannable as dodge jumps.

I love the [Funerary Greatsword](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/archive/1/1c/20170930081602%21Funerary_Greatsword_wielded.jpg) on my Reaper.  Its sand effect is more subtle than some of the others, the purple glow pairs well with the green necro theme, plus it's a khopesh which feels appropriate.
---
Before current infographic they released another where they stated 11 mil accounts. Not to mention hey have neither the revenue, nor the visibility of the 11 mil player game. Even fuckin WoW doesnt have that many players.
---
So defending the 11 mil players lie is the most naive thing Ive seen on this sub for a long time.

Thread removed: Stirring up drama is not allowed.

There are certain minor advantages and disadvantages for each race. Asuras have the smallest character model. They are slightly easier to do jumping puzzles with, compared to Norns and Charrs. Meanwhile if you want to show off your fashion wars 2, then a bigger character model is probably easier. Humans have the best fashion available because there is a strong bias towards humans in outfit design.
---
I dont fix the gamemode. I play as we feel like, and those 95% of pugs means there will always be pugs very willing to join us even with harsh requirements due to the benefits we bring.
---
Unless you have the option set to "On Demand"
---
If by 'benefits' you mean toxicity and insults than yes, you do bring a lot of that.
---
Making new communities that organize bunch of random events. It had a huge role in my early gw2 days and made me stick with the game and eventually buy HoT.
---
2 huge ones from EU have shut down last year.
---
What Anet can do is make more events like TT and serpent's ire. Something that's challenging, but requires players to organize a bit better. Gw2 doesn't feel like MMO anymore.
---
Playing, leading/organising events. Buying from gemstore from time to time.
---
as a self-imposed challenge, I used to run my thief with no pants, because it looked good on her and felt in character.
---
It's bad writing and let us feel stupid.
---
I don't think you as a player are obliged to do anything. Community already made few things that developer should provide to help other players. Just to mention few: 
---
- arc dps (with build templates), 
---
- lfg tool (before in-game one was made), 
---
- gw2wiki as a whole is only monitored by anet, but 99% of effort is on community,
---
- in game events to keep alive abandoned content like Serpent's Ire meta or Triple Trouble
---
- in game events that make it to press, like Pink Day in LA, LGBT Parade in June (sorry I can't remember the name), Toga Party
---
Community did enough. Maybe not you or me personally, but in general.
---
Wise developer should provide tools for this. People were asking for refer a friend system, like in other games. That would help tremendously with pushing word of mouth marketing. But if Anet doesn't care, why should we?
---
What? It's more like 40 gigs.
---
dummy thicc
---
Enjoy!

but only if its in an ultra rare drop table from specific caches from a specific map and costs 99,999 gold on the TP with only 12 in stock.
---
What stats does your gear have?
---
You can get some dps focused gear for your soulbeast. Solo pve content is pretty easy as long as you have more dps orientated build, but even druid would do the job.
---
You responded to a comment about **multiboxing bots**. What you're trying to argue isn't even relevant. I really don't see how bot multiboxing and someone who wants to regular multibox can fall under the same justification for being reported or banned.  That makes zero sense.
---
yepp. 2 total.
---
It's used by every bad ranger. It's not unpopular
---
Metabattle has decent open world builds for soloplay.
---
Don't buy mount skins until they start producing content that's worth playing.
---
My kind of getting people into gw2 and keeping them:
---
-recommending the game
---
-being helpful
---
Got someone from work into the game recently, he already purchased both xpacs. Me simply made a deal to look into each others main game ;)
---
And just yesterday I was asked by a newbie who started of 1-2 weeks ago if I could help him to getting started at WvW roaming. Guess what? I did, we roamed for 2-3 hours even with discord and I explained all about the game mode I could.
---
But what's really helping them to stay is the game itself, all we can do as single parts of the community, is show them everything this game has to offer and help them if they are struggling ;)
---
fortunately; im no necro main :)
---

I would prefer this tbh
---
Living story if you like computer games.
---
Convenience items of the game is more of a lifestyle for you.
---
I’d love to see some more tattoo revealing armor. Especially for males
---
Do you know any middle wight stripper female armor I’m really curious all the ones I have are ugly trench coats
---
that's why you train on the golem where it doesn't matter until you *are* fast.
---
Trying to do it right and fast the first time is asking for fuck-ups. First you do it right, so that you get the order correct, and then you do it fast.
---
Gotta love repping my CM titles then getting knocked of the platform during Cairn. ?__?
---
[deleted]
---
&gt; What can I do, what can we all do, to help bring new players to the game, and more importantly, keep them?
---
Why do you believe that you should be doing it, and that this is the best contribution to the longevity and health of your game that you can make as a player?   
---
The first goal would be obviously to vote with your wallet and make it clear when the direction of the game's development is questionable. Quality feedback is the most important asset you have, and quality feedback works that much better when it is supported by crunchy green dollar bills.   
---
&gt; Obviously a huge amount is out of our control, content droughts, dev communication etc, but how do we put our best foot forward with that which we can?
---
Help steer the development in the right direction to the best extent that is available to you. Do not reward mistakes and obviously malicious practices by providing free advertising. That's why I would have recommended anyone to avoid spending money on the game, or playing it altogether, before the recent layoffs/restructuring, because your money didn't go towards ensuring the game's success and future.
---
What two shut down?
---
25 might, not really all that fast, in your opener you do 8 aa rotations in shroud, which will get you to 25 might.  But yeah pretty slow.
---
The bigger perk for reaper is, you get quickness (and crit cap) permanently in shroud.  For example, say a chrono pulls mobs with focus, and then starts casting shield 5 to give some quickness.  You can make sure you have quickness before the pull even happens and then start your spin to win.  For trash mob bursting, I think reaper really might even pull ahead.  You might scoff at that, but trash mobs are a significant portion of fractals, for example cliff side.  
---
For really short bursts like the guy protecting the portal at the start of reactor fractal, the build up time of a chrono giving quickness can be a significant factor.  The chrono needs to hit sword 3 (if doing a cs), then cast shield 5 (without quickness in opener so it is kinda slow).
---
I'm not saying power reaper is better than dgh, I'm just saying that we need to realize that golem numbers are helpful, but don't necessarily tell the whole story, sometimes the gap between reaper and others can narrow or widen based on the circumstances.
---
Battle speedos.
---
The variety just isn't there. If you want to create a like egyptian or african inspired archer, you're SOL. You'll be forced to wear a trench coat (or some big coat) and boots. I had to delete one my male medium character because there was just no other silhouette you could create. 
---
And the gender differences just seem like additional annoying work. Like good luck creating a male character that shows off [this much skin](https://i.imgur.com/UCpncri.png). Another example is [T3 Human Light](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Human_cultural_armor/Light#Tier_3). If you're going to put all that effort into designing something that looks great and show off skin, carry that over to male characters too. Same vice versa. Give people the variety this game desperately needs, and until then, giving people the option to toggle on/off all clothing slots.
---
Your Power-Ferocity options are Scholar, Deadeye, and Ogre. Flame Legion is also solid on Holosmith while remaining very cheap.
---
Eagle runes are OK if you don't crit-cap, but Engineer crit-caps with full Zerker IIRC, so they're not a good pick in this case. If you're debating between Eagle and Flame Legion, go with the latter.
---
WoW has a ring or two that rendered on your character’s hand. I... may have gone out of my way to wear it. A lot.
---
With spikes
---
Yeah what is WITH that? I like to believe that my norn’s lingerie has a distinctly Elsa vibe. Snow queens unite.
---
Appreciate it! I actually do have 2 GWAMMs. Champion of the Gods is for 50/50 HoM points :)
---
I’ve looked a bit at the salvage tools. Is there any reason the copper fed one is better than the Runesalvage kit?
---
My rag tag group of 2-4 WvW friends regularly cap the Desert Keeps in off hours, and nobody tends to even notice.
---
my 1yr+ raid leader is very good at this but i also think they being a well spoken canadian also has something to do with it
---
Plus the 5th downstate skill, which is pretty nice and op on Necros.
---
WTB Dye Randomizer Button. :&lt;
---
Anyway I love the detail of this mount and glad it came from Samantha, I wish she could create more! &lt;/3 It was worth it for me buying this skin twice for a Friend and I. :)
---
You called?
---
wild guess at "exotic set with Monk runes" is its just a set of ascalonian dungeon Magi gear.
---
Their best bet will be buying a cheap power (Berserker) set
---
And for all the people saying "but people would just run around naked and ruin my immersion", I have *never* seen anyone in FFXIV glamor their gear to be the full invisible set. It's rare to see anyone use the chest item too, considering male characters have the option of an awesome arm tattoo chest piece instead. I've never seen a female character using the invisible chest.
---
It's worth noting that Terror's problem is less about the damage it does, and that it shares a slot with Master of Corruption, which is a higher damage option all around. Aside from that, necromancer \*can\* make use of nightmare regardless, but they have enough other options that you can take a slightly lower duration rune (like lich) and still sit comfortably for your bleed duration.
---
Would look good on males, but what would they do for females?
---
The damage from conditions comboed in your fields will be yours, but you don't need it to be high.
---
can also confirm eotm keeps work, thats how i helped my pve pleb friend get it
---
so in all ogre is the best?
---
Tyvm, the grind paid off :D Irony is, i still struggle with 4 others. When your not running a specified build (somewhat) your just as useless as always.
---
I love all your ideas so much. I thought I wanted a minion focused Necro spec, but a ghostly swordsman is interesting. And please yes to the Golemancer Engineer, my Iron Man themed Holosmith needs it
---
Yup! NPCs in actual swimwear.
---
/u/RhinoBarbarian and /u/Etheri 
---
Guys... We've had this discussion before and it annoys the whole team to click on modqueue and see your entire argument reported. Just stay away from each other okay.
---
But you don't see the condition numbers when someone comboes your field
---
That's pretty subjective, people enjoy different classes for different reasons and personal preference.

Oh totally, I think it's only rivaled by XIV, but [as you can see](https://cdn3.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FFXIV_Equality_005.jpg) it becomes obvious why, they're actually trying to keep things equal. 
---
Hopefully with the current ANET team feeling reinvigorated by the community rallying around the roadmap and stuff, they take a serious look at these aspects that are frustratingly preventing Fashion Wars from reaching its potential.
---
&gt; But only male-presenting nipples
---
Not in times of gender-equality!
---
pistol ele, something like outlaw star caster guns where the ammo provides the magic, with the ammunition system featuring heavy usage.  And maybe some utility skills that focus on reloads (similar to signet of aether recharging phantasms).
---
I believe females already have all the armour showing out what they have? 
---
XD
---
I mean, plate bikini xD
---
What is the point of this question? It would do the same as it does on males.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
I don't scoff at the idea of killing trash mobs more quickly. That's valuable, I can agree.
---
I do scoff at you suggesting Reaper will beat out DH without any evidence. Feelings aren't a super useful discussion to me. Golem numbers might not tell the whole story, sure. I can get behind that. But something has to tell the story, and it's not feelings.
---
Besides that, when it comes to most fractals, people are primarily talking about bosses and CMs in particular. Because higher DPS allows for mechanic skipping. That's where the majority of your time saving is going to come in, skipping mechanics. Not clearing trash. That said, I'm sure there are Reapers out there that could eclipse my DH in DPS on Fractal CMs. I'm not a perfect player. The guy in this video would be a prime candidate for it in fact.
---
Like I said, I don't think Reaper is *bad*. I truly don't. But it's sub-optimal.
---
If you want to get into more controversial opinions, I do hold a belief that bad players tend to flock to Necro. That opinion I can understand being downvoted for, because I have nothing other than a large amount of anecdotal evidence to back it up. And I could very well be affected by confirmation bias here, I've not tracked the data.
---
I don't think all Necros are bad, that's far from what I'm saying. I do believe that there are more bad Necros out there than any other class, based on what I get in Fractal pugs. Soulbeasts and Firebrands coming next up.
---
QWER movement; Q dodge, WR strafe. 1-5 weapons, ASDF skills, Tab heal, T interact. Mouse buttons bound to Alt and Shift, mostly for menus, targeting, and mounts, but Alt is also Show All Enemy Names for loot.

That hideously deformed chest with drooping mantits and the crooked posture is precisely why we need covering armor for male norn.

---
Did you use shortcut eagle? Did you get the baubles where it drops you? Very easy to miss those. Once you hit the final checkpoint where the boss is, there is simply no way back to the start in any difficulty.
---
I can help ingame if you still need it.
---
like the masteries themselves the Mastery Points are account based unlocks. But don't worry there are plenty of them. I'm maxed mastery level, haven't gotten every single point in any of the three regions and still have 10+ points to spare in each region.
---
As for the storyline, you only get them once on completion. 
---
If you are looking for more you can get some from Living world season 2 story and story achievements, you can also find some on some Central Tyria maps (they have the same icon as the mastery point on the map). 
---
Here's a  [list](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery_point_unlocks) of all the mastery points you can get and how to get them, in case you were looking for it.
---
All Mastery Points are awarded using the game's Achievement system.  Open the Achievements panel from the Hero menu and look for red stars, those show achievements that give mastery points.
---
The easiest ones to get will be for things like the various commune points under "Mastery Insights", spoon collecting, the Hidden Garden jumping puzzle, and the various ones from the Silverwastes.  There are more to be found in dungeons and fractals, and from some longer-term achievements like collecting Ambrite weapons, Luminescent armour and cultural armour.  And then Living World Season 2 has 16 total mastery points associated with it as well, 8 for completing the story and 8 more for doing all the associated achievements for each story.
---
My Norn SB recently adopted the naked chest look (yay cultural armor), and now grants naked chest hugs to all that request them.
---
&gt; No idea how to play Necro

No, cause I stopped playing and dont have the gems for the outfit I wanted. It was the green robe with the plunging neckline. And I mean PLUNGING!

Just to clarify, check to see what buffs to put on yourself and what conditions to put on the golem

---
It’s the lack of pause and pronunciation in his speech that made me think that for some reason.
---
You mean you’re afraid of pure manliness? ;)
---
In my mind, druid isn't really a great teamfighter and you might be better off going on a side node and play as a 1v1er.
---
The strenght of druid is in its ability to kite, disengage, resustain and re-engage a fight. Which makes it a very, very annoying duelist as it's really hard to get rid of it. It shines in small skirmish but doesn't do enough pressure/control/support to be a strong teamfighter.
---
For the initial split, if you can get far and keep the point neutral, then that's best. But since druid doesn't have a lot of damage you don't want to get in a 1v1 on an enemy node unless you know you'll have assistance for the kill or the opponent is very fragile and can't defend the point. (like revenant or non-sd thief)
---
Going home at the begining is also a good option, but since druid' sustain relly quite a bit on kiting and stealthing, it makes it harder to defend a point than to attack it. (Then again, that's true for every build but moreso for druid imo) But worst case scenario, you can keep home neutral for a while and disengage if things gets really bad. That's not something that can be said for every build.
---
Of course, you need to be adaptable. There will be moments where you have nowhere to go but to teamfight, don't be afraid to do it if that's what you think is the best decision at the moment.
---
Oh damm I was happy to get 1 I guess you must prefer Champion over it then.
---
When I first started the game, I was trying to find Togatl Grounds in Kessex Hills, it was the last place I needed to find to finish that map section. It took an hour to find someone to help me, I even messaged a few mentors during this time. 
---
I wanted to complete events, or even do Renowned Hearts, and all these high leveled players would jump on mounts and one shot everything before I had a chance to get some damage in. 
---
I think helping new players, and giving them a chance to catch up and learn the game is very important, and things like I mentioned above were \*super\* frustrating for me, and I probably would of quit, but didn't because the reason I got into the game in the first place (to play with my SO) kept me going.
---
I use it on my Deimos Hand Kite build.
---
You point out the exact problem IMO about a lot of Video Game community. Not everyone is a good teacher, even if you are top player didn't mean you are the best to teachs other how to do it. Streamer or Youtuber wasn't always the best teacher even if they are good at the games. This can cause problem in some community when big Influencer give advise that can be good but not the right way. So it will cause more trouble than actually helping. 
---
A good teacher will know how to give important information without drowning the students and will know how to responds about comments.
---
You get only 8 for the personal story, despite 42 showing up in the hero panel's achievement setup.
---
This is awesome work.  I did some preliminary testing under Linux with DXVK and the results look great!
---
UGLY?!
---
Yeah actually haha. The chest piece is nice but the rest of that armor is uggo.
---
at min graphics i get about 20 fps on my macbook air from 2015, so just playing it should be fine.

Leaves No Hero Behind because 100 CM frac. is my favorite PVE content, and because I don't leave other heroes behind.

Good enough you mean. Lose enough matches and you get teamed up with so low classed opponents you can win just by standing on a cap point doing nothing.

---
Wooden potatoes is doing a playthrough of SAB and just finished W2Z2. He seemed to think there are multiple no-return spots.
---
He particularly pointed out that you need to take the shortcut eagle, get the baubles up there on the scaffolding stuff, then jump off the map to reset back to the squid checkpoint and do the level normally from there.
---
It's what I appreciate about ff14.
---
1) World is fairly busy. There are always players leveling new characters. A lot of the beginner maps also have world boss events and leyline anomaly events that draw in level 80s because the rewards scale anyway.   
---
2) There is a built in LFG system, and you can always ask nicely in map chat. Or find guilds and discords you are interested in, try /r/GuildRecruitment  
---
3) I'm not sure what you mean by this but crafting is always useful. You can also level your characters by doing crafting (up to 10 character levels per crafting discipline)  
---
4) I would say 99% is Auction House based. You can still trade outside of it but it's unsecured, i.e. no direct trade interface, use mail instead.  
---
5) Raids and Fractals are your PvE end game and they are very much alive. Personally I've been told GW2 Raids are easier than FF14 and WoW Raids. Dungeons are the "old" PvE content but there's still players doing them.
---
Yes!! We need this. I always felt like my Charr would look better if I could actually see the markings in the fur.
---
For 3, I meant that is there any real reward to it. WoW used to have a robust and rewarding system, but overtime it’s been dumbed down into just filler content to keep you busy and sometimes get something cosmetic from. 
---
Thank you so much for the reply! One of my biggest fears is playing an mmorpg game mostly on my own,
---
Oh thank you so much for this link!
---
Former high level WoW player/raider here. GW2 is the reason I'll never renew my WoW sub.
---
1) Is the world busy? Will I meet players outside of endgame zones, or should I expect to do the new player leveling mostly solo?
---
Yes, some areas are more popular than others. A lot of story content is instanced so it's just you but open world content is busy. Also leveling is less grindy because of random events which people come do when they spawn 
---
2) Sort of related to 1, is there a looking for group system where I can party up with people looking to do similar content without necessarily knowing them or having ever actually met them?
---
Yes. LFG is the main way people do older content like dungeons. 
---
3) Is there an interactive professions system that rewards players for really going for the crafting or gathering of top tier stuff?
---
Oh hell yes. This is an awesome thing about GW2. The top tier gear ("Ascended" gear) is only obtainable by crafting, PvP, WvW (a game mode focusing on servers against each other trying to hold capture points) or Raiding (which needs Ascended gear most of the time). Lots of players will never do pvp or wvw and the easiest way for them to get the best gear is to craft it
---
4) How is the economy fueled? Is it heavily “Auction House” based or more so a direct player to player trade system? 
---
First you need to understand that the money value is very different from WoW. 50-60g in GW2 is a lot. Legendary weapons cost about 2000 gold on average and I would say that 80% of players will never have 2000 gold at once. 
---
There's a lot of high value drops (3g+ is pretty nice). Gathering is very profitable and crafting can be too. There isn't a direct trade system unfortunately, just the in game mail. 
---
5) What should I expect if I were interested in endgame raiding? Are there active groups always running raids? Is there a chance for me to experience old stuff, or has the player base moved onto the current content.
---
Raiding is very popular and lucrative. There are LFG groups but as a WoW player you'll understand when I say they're hit or miss. Luckily, most guilds do raiding and there are several dedicated raid training groups. 
---
There is definitely some dead content, mainly dungeons, but they're still a way to make money so you can find groups. I recently just finished all the dungeon stories with LFG groups. 
---
6) is there any sort of third party add-on support that would allow me to modify my UI?
---
Not to the degree of WoW. There's a couple things like the mount assistant and ArcDPS but mods aren't really here yet. There's an API system that gives data on your account for in game overlays that can tell you what you have of haven't done yet. 
---
... 
---
Also, I just want to add that mounts in GW2 are amazing coming from WoW. They don't follow the norm of "moving, but faster" and "moving, but in the air now". Instead, they all have unique aspects. The springer jumps high, the skimmer goes over water, the griffin glides but doesn't fly (you constantly lose altitude) 
---
Honestly, you should try GW2. It's f2p to get the idea and if you like it there's no monthly subscription fee so you can buy it and not feel like you have to play every day.
---
I'm the guy responsible behind that general idea.
---
My reasoning is simple, it could be anywhere. For all we know the Black Citadel didn't even exist back when the Flame Legion lost control of the other three. The lack of any monuments or landmarks on Ascalon is highly suspicious as well.
---
Yeah there's still reason to use the crafting system imo. Food, utilities, potions, inventory bags, weapons and armor. Quite a lot of end game stuff is account bound so you either get it from end game content rewards, or you have to craft them.  
---
You're welcomed to try the game out for free, the F2P account restrictions don't really hurt that much until you hit level 80. You have plenty of time to decide if you want to spend a single cent in this game.   
---
I think the community in GW2 is pretty neat, you can be in up to FIVE guilds at once! And you can choose which guild you want to represent at any time.
---
Hope to see you in game.
---
Just because you cannot access them doesn't mean no one can.
---
crafting is essential to end game content unless you want to put insane hours for gold for high tier gear since you can craft almost all of it. and food gets expensive for end game level stuff considering a lot of it is event tied or end game level recipes. definitely rewarding if you want to gather and craft stuff to sell or use
---
also glyphs for might
---
NP. I used this link when I first started out, so I'm just paying it forward.
---
This is a pretty comprehensive explanation!
---
If you're the type to pay a little bit to get some good Quality-of-Life tools, even, I'd suggest getting the Runecrafter's Salvage-o-Matic while it's still available, and possibly some Unlimited Harvesting Tools. These are not at all strictly necessary but they will make things easier. Shared Inventory Slots and Material Expansion are also exceptionally handy. And an Armistice Bastion pass or Mistlock Sanctuary (when it comes back up) offer critical hubs for players to get to all manner of important vendors and stations, and then return to where they previously were in the world with ease and without a gold cost.
---
I'm the guy behind that Cantha layout. Shing Jea would be part of the Living World. Exhibits:
---
* [Expansion zones (zones + battlegrounds)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:User_Lon-ami_The_Celestial_Tournament_map.jpg)
---
* [Living World zones (zones + raids)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:User_Lon-ami_Bells_of_Harvest_map.jpg)
---
Note that the above maps are part of a [Cantha expansion idea](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Lon-ami/Cantha#New_expansion_pack:_The_Celestial_Tournament), written a few months ago.
---
Crafting is the main way for you to get bis gear in this game. There other ways to get it but crafting is the center in most of them. Note that we have the same gear tier in terms of power level for the last 6 years and this will not change. Gw2 is very different to other MMOs and I suggest you do not approach it as one.
---
I don't get how they recorded one single line for like 20 npcs.
---
Also the Roller Beetle goes super fast, the Warclaw is meh in open world but changed up WvW in big ways, and soon the Skyscale will mix Springer and Griffon elements into a singular mount. All mount regardless of release require Path of Fire expansion to keep permanently however (sometimes they offer "mount rentals" during holiday events though)
---
Thank you for responding. I was really hoping to get input from another ex-Wow player. I’ve heard such high praise of the mount system, that it alone sparked my interest in the game.
---
I’m def gonna try it out. Like you and other have mentioned here, it’s free to try at least and afaik, I’ll get a good portion of the base game out of it.
---
Mistlock Sanctuary is imo the best quality of life improvement item you can buy. Copper-Fed-Salvage-O-Matic is 2nd. Silver-fed and Runecrafter's I think can just be replaced with Mystic Salvage Kits.
---
Boot camp that shit and get the windows version, mine ran 1000x smoother and just felt better, partitioning the hard dive isn’t as daunting as it seems either
---
Maps are instanced, but most of them are connected to one another.
---
I wouldn't mind a GW2 Mobile as a side project. Emphasis on side project. Who knows, might've even played it a bit while waiting on the Gerent. Anet can't live off GW2 alone forever.
---
I thought of this too when I first saw the mount skin, and even though I love it a lot, I won't be getting it (maybe) because it bothers me so much.
---
Hi, I am a current WoW player looking for a new game. Do you have any insight on the PVP side of GW2 (compared to WoW)? I just would like to know basic things, like is pvp balanced in GW2 (if I pick a class, will I later find out that it is unusable in pvp)? Is gearing a big issue for GW2 pvp? is pvp in GW2 complicated, requiring months of research and practice? is the PVP scene still active in GW2 or dying?

 * 3 capture points up to 10v10 (I think)

 * 2v2 Deathmatch
---
 * Team Deathmatch up to 10v10
---
* Tournaments
---
 * Usually 5v5 Conquest
---
 * Sometimes 2v2 Deathmatch
---
**World versus World:** "World PvP" but with huge dedicated maps and defending big objectives, or assaulting them with siege weapons. Three teams, so it's more like World versus World versus World. Current maximum for each map is 80–90 people *per team* (the largest map has a different cap).
---
**Gear for sPvP:**
---
* You start with the best gear in the game.
---
* Your level in PvE does not matter. You unlock PvP at level 3.
---
* You can pick from most stat combinations in the game, but some are locked behind a one-time fee of a little gold. You get gold very quickly by playing sPvP, even if you lose, so you can use that to buy the runes/sigils/stat combo you want. I unlocked them all just for fun. If they remove a stat combo/rune/sigil from the game because it's OP, you get your gold back.
---
* You still have to own the Heart of Thorns or Path of Fire expansions to use their content.
---
* You earn a lot of gear you can use in PvE and WvW just by playing PvP.
---
**Gear for WvW:**
---
* You use your equipment from PvE.
---
* It helps to be level 80.
---
* It takes very little time.
---
* Buying an expansion gives you a Level-80 Boost and a full set of exotic level-80 gear with some stat combo. I wouldn't recommend using the boost right off the bat.
---
**Skill:** The matchmaking is somewhat okay and it doesn't take too long to learn, but it helps to know how to play PvE Gw2 first. Some people say levelling your character from 1 to the cap (80) is the tutorial. You might not like/be good at the first profession you play, so you might want to switch to another because it might play quite differently. For example, thieves have no recharge (cooldown) on any of their weapon skills.
---
**PvP activity:** It's pretty okay
---
**Class balance:** It's pretty okay
---
Wow Armistice Bastion sounds pretty good too, thanks! I don't wvw much nor do I have enough disposable income to justify having 2 lounge access though lol.
---
This really needed a thread...to trash on a possibly scrapped project.
---
Same here. I just know that I'd never have the patience, so all those solo people are quite impressive.
---
There is the tank/healer/dps trifecta to an extent but it's much looser than other MMOs.
---
Each base class (I.e. Ranger) has two elite specializations, one per expansion. Ranger has Druid and Soulbeast. Druid is a dedicated healer class and Soulbeast plays either Power (direct damage) or Condi (damage over time) DPS. Most classes have a playable Condi and Power build.
---
As far as most of the game goes, there are very few builds where you're ineffective. You can do most content with anything. Some are easier than others, obviously. The Necromancer's Reaper spec is often the king of soloing difficult content but is only average on high level group content (especially raids) because it doesn't have a lot of mobility
---
mutated penguin
---
Yes, great point. Loot is always instanced, reviving players reward exp, there's never really a feel of unfriendly competition in the open world.
---
But my Polymock Go.
---
Wait.. am I on twitter?
---
Every zone is independent and there's a loading screen into the next. Each zone is hosted on an instance that can hold a certain amount of players (maybe 100? not sure), any more and another instance of the  same map will be created automatically for anyone that's loading in after.
---
Yup!  Easiest way?  Install Windows 10 instead of MacOS and play all the windows games you want.
---
Yeah, there are "talent trees" for each of the classes called traits. Each class has five basic traitlines that focus on particular aspects of that specific class (e.g. Guardian has Zeal that focuses on power damage, Radiance that focuses on Burning uptime and Critical Hits, Valor that focuses on blocking and damage mitigation, Honor that focuses on healing and life support, and Virtues which powers up some Utility Skills and your F1, F2, and F3 Virtue skills), and two Elite Specialization traitlines that overhaul how the class works (e.g. Guardian has Dragonhunter that gives access to Traps and augments Virtues to have physical effects like a damaging spear, a flying leap that heals, and a big shield that blocks projectiles, and Firebrand that gives access to multi-part Meditation skills and augments those Virtues to work like Meditations).
---
https://snowcrows.com/ is GW2's version of IcyVeins, which provides guides and outlines for the best ways to orient your skills.
---
The way they are sorta pushing it these days is that any class can play any spec (Even if there will always be a meta, I mean come on who's gonna be a theif healer.)
---
I really love that they're doing it this way, being able to be a guardian healer, dps, tank.. but like the other guy commented, yeah. It's a lot looser. If you're in a group of friends, hey go nuts. They'll be fine to tag along your theif healer to try wacky things.
---
Pugs though.. naw they usually want specific things. Druid healers, chrono supports and tanks.. condi dps. It gets more strict, another reason I mentioned getting a good casual guild, it's more fun when people want to pry from the meta a little, and try things that are MAYBE 5% worse but more fun to play.
---
Also, when I said they were heroic type raids, they don't have a LFR level, or a normal level.. somtimes they might have a mythic level, but yeah. You go 0 to 100 real fast in raiding. Videos help a lot.

Everyone is saying GPU but if other games are running fine, it wouldn't hurt to run [\-verify](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments#-verify) and/or [\-repair](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments#-repair) on the game client.

This looks like some extreme screen tearing to me.  If your drivers are up to date make sure Vertical Sync is turned on in the options menu

Don't get the key, you could end up with junk.  Get 10 more statues and wait for something you really want to come up for 60 statues and buy that.

Like The Moot or The Dreamer? Hey, here's a short bow that shoots fanciful rainbow unicorns!

I wouldn't recommend the Golden Key.  If you just wait you can pick the chest exclusive for about the same amount of statuettes.
---
And charr get loincloths...
---
While Asura get swimsuits. Like... Apparently all the asura are those elementary school kids who run around in the same bathing suit all summer long.
---
Ehhh, PvP balance is kinda iffy. ArenaNet does do PvP balancing occasionally but classes rotate in and out of the meta.   
---
Gear is NOT an issue at all for PvP, because all gear is equalized for everyone, and same with character level. As soon as you load into the PvP zone, everyone has the same base stats, and all you choose is a stat allocation and build. You can join PvP as soon as your character finishes the tutorial mission, I believe. If it's your first character you might have to unlock PvP after a bit of leveling.   
---
PvP in GW2 is pretty intricate but I don't really know how to compare it. To get good, of course you need to study and practice. Some builds are harder to execute well but you get better results.   
---
PvP scene in GW2 is kinda stale. The people who seriously PvP are pretty dedicated. A lot of the general player base don't PvP because of the bad rep that PvP players get. Some of them can get pretty abusive in chat. Unfortunately, ArenaNet doesn't seem to care too much about toxic players, win trading, botting, game throwing, hacking, etc. Not saying that you'll encounter lots of those, but PvP is definitely a less friendly environment than Open World content.  
---
Also PvP isn't too rewarding, I only play it for the PvP-exclusive rewards and achievements.
---
The Eternal
---
It reminds me of raids and how much I hate them.
---
Well, they also wore blue body paint called *woad*, and spiked their hair with lye.
---
Thx for the details! I will give it a try. Do you have any advice on a class that is good/popular for pvp? And any info on picking an active server (if that matters in GW2)?
---
immortal legend because I didn't pay for a boost.
---
So you have 2 main pvp gamemode : Spvp which is arena based pvp, and WvW which is more like open world pvp with 3 factions and siege warfare.
---
Spvp is build to be the competitive gamemode, meaning that gear and level have absolutely 0 impact : everyone is on a level-playing field. There is unranked mode, a solo/duoQ ranked mode with seasons and leaderboard and automated tournaments build for teams(3 per days + a big monthly tournament + some special tournaments once in a while). 
---
sPvP is 5vs5 and it's a conquest gamemode which is very different from standard deathmatch. The fighting itself is just one half of the game, the other half (and arguably the most important) is about how to play around the 3 capture points, choosing the right fights and basically be at the right place at the right time, or as we call it here : rotations (how players rotate around the map to create advantage/disadvantage).
---
Balance is alright at the moment but it's clearly not the most fun and the worst of it is that the meta can be extremely stale with very little change for a long time even when there's some big balance issue.
---
Population is pretty alright too as long as you don't get too close to the very top. GW2 used to have an esport scene, but it died out a few years ago leading to a lot of very high profile team/players quiting the game. And that created quite a disparity, altho it's slowly healing and we see more and more "new faces" being able to compete with the old timers who never left the top since basically launch.
---
The best part of pvp imo is how it makes gw2's combat system truely shines. It's pretty fast paced, but you still have time to react/predict every move your opponent can throw at you, and while your build plays an important part, there's always room to completely outplay your opponent.
---
I strongly suggest looking for pvp streams, or [tournament shoutcast vod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvcArb7RLNM).
---
Also be aware that the rock dog can *rarely* cause issues with enemy pathing. I've seen snipers get hung up on a rock dog instead of being properly LoS'd at Bandit Trio.
---
I'm not a pvper. But the biggest thing is probably going to be dodging/blocking/evading/stunbreaking. These are limited resources that basically everyone gets, so it can make things extremely tough to learn. You have to watch for skill animations and such, know when you're opponent is on cooldown for their important escapes, ect.  
---
It's actually something that comes up in raiding too, there will be attacks with very little warning sometimes because everyone can dodge to avoid damage.
---
Just so we're clear: you hold the parent comment -- the one that states that "no title in GW2 has any value at all" -- in equal contempt as well, right?
---
Yeah just go play and tell people you're new, the gw2 community is outstandingly nice, theres always people running around the maps, professions are good for solo progression (ie making you're own epic weapons but selling them is nette gain) it's a solid world, similar to wow but instead of gods, old gods and dragons in their history it's mostly wars and politics on top of the Big Bad of Dragons (dragons are more like gods from a plot perspective)
---
Best part is the combat which I forgot to mention cause I got carried away with the other great things the game offers lol you can also pvp at lvl 1 straight away if you only care about pvp
---
I would suggest doing Longbow / Sword+Axe and statting all your gear with the "Berserker's" prefixes.
---
The cool thing is that this build is pretty bullet-proof especially if you have PoF and become a Soulbeast.
---
If you don't have PoF, you are going to want to have a cat pet, I forgot which one was the best. The jaguar maybe? If you do have PoF, Rock Gazelle can't be beat.
---
So why Sword+Axe over Greatsword? Because axe skills 4 and 5 are pretty much the best power ranger skills.
---
Why Longbow over Greatsword? Well, mainly because you don't want to double melee. The overall DPS figures of these two choices are very close so you don't have to feel guilty about using the Longbow even in the highest tier fractals. Don't let anyone give you crap for it either. I would even argue that it has a better overall DPS.
---
The important thing to remember is that Sword+Axe is your main set for boss fights. You can camp Longbow for farming and tagging mobs, but you don't want to stay in it too long in boss fights. Get in range, your allies will buff you and heal you better if you are in melee range and you will do more damage.
---
Keeping with that theme, don't trait for ranged damage. I know that penetrating longbow trait can be tempting, but that's not your goal. Longbow is your TOOL, Sword+Axe is your WEAPON.
---
If you're going to fight an enemy with melee, the best thing you can do is start with the Longbow, throw up a Barrage and then tear it up with Rapid Fire as it approaches, then switch to your melee set throw an axe at it (skill 4) and start flailing around like you know what you're doing (skill 5.)
---
The beatle is amazing. Tbh, the whole mount system is amazing, different mount for every situation.
---
 It makes other MMOs feel like a cash grab on their Mounts (+skins), Anets system is very fair to the consumer and there is no pressure to get mount skins.
---
&gt; For all we know the Black Citadel didn't even exist back when the Flame Legion lost control of the other three.
---
Actually, we do know this. It's pretty explicitly explained in Ghosts of Ascalon, pages 136-137, where Ember Doomforge tells the story of Balthea Havocbringer and Kalla Scorchrazor.
---
TL;DR, Kalla challenged Forge Ironstrike at the ruins of Rin for the Iron Legion's assistance (the Blood Legion Imperator already backing Kalla, and the Ash Imperator backing Forge). The challenge was simple: if Kalla won, Forge would accept women as valid fighters, if Kalla lost, Forge would kill Kalla as an example. After this, the united legions marched on the Flame Citadel to overthrow the Flame Legion.
---
Given that the Flame Citadel - aka Citadel of Flame, located at Hrangmer - is in northwestern Fireheart Rise, and Rin being where that is, the Plains of Golghein must be between them.
---
Already rebnoud screenshot Hotkey to 1? ;)
---
You mean trib mode isn't about trial and error with your routes?  I've been fooled this whole time
---
Which server are you going to be playing on? If you have any questions, I can help out. Pretty sure most people here would also help out if asked/requested.
---
Now that would be ridiculous.... xD
---
Honestly, the AA needs a heavy buff, and the 3 could be faster (same what they did to longbow 2 on Ranger years ago).
---
Unfortunately the lore implies it melted, just like Echovald Forest lost its petrified nature following Shiro’s second defeat.
---
Well Scepter is used on one-hit Weaver builds, and fresh-air tempest.
---
&gt; so will not melt or turn back into water.
---
Similar to the Echovald Forest, rumors claim that since Shiro's second defeat the Jade Sea had been liquifying once more.[6]

1. Played on EU servers, some areas in a map will be REALLY busy, other areas will be empty, but there will mostly be lots of people on every map, just not in the area you are in. This is due to some events/quests being much more popular than others. I found earlier maps to have a good amount of people spread around, the 35-60s seemed empty, then towards the end it increases and if you go to a farming map it is insane. I did stumble upon a world boss on my levelling experience and it was hype af.
---
2. Yes, press Y.
---
3. Nah, I mean it does, but some other MMOs I played did it better imo. Crafting and other professions are more of a side thing you do. However you 100% need to do it unless you don't want to get end game gear or like rng.
---
4. Auction house. You have a global market (cross server I believe) that people put stuff up for, then you can buy the stuff directly. You can also place an order. Think Steam marketplace.  
---
5. Yes. There are raid training discords and guild that do raids. However someone else will have to link you to them because I never got into raiding. Also note you can join 5 guilds at the same time. Therefore you don't have to limit yourself to a raiding guild.
---
6. ArcDPS is the one I used. Not really needed, just cool to see that I sucked and wasn't all that good as I thought I was. Really useful for creating combos though.
---
Things to note, gw2 isn't like other MMOs, I tell others you play gw2 after you have played other MMOs and want somewhere to retire. There is no gear treadmill, which to me is a massive positive. I can stop playing for months, come back and not worry about getting new gear to do the next map or expansion, just jump back in and enjoy myself. However, this does mean that you do not get that ultra rare OP gear that can one shot everything (until they nerf it or the next expansion hits), instead it is a cool cosmetic or some other toy, the fun stuff. I do not know you, however you seem like you enjoy pre-endgame a lot and that is what makes your MMO experience best, to me gw2 doesn't have the best pre-endgame content but it isn't the worst either. If you buy an expansion and are bored of levelling you can just use the level boost, the end game maps are some of the most fun I have had in any MMO.
---
Also, if you truly want to enjoy the game try to set your own goals, fun goals. The game won't set you goals, you have to set them yourself. During the levelling process you might want to explore. The most fun I have had is running around, jumping around and thinking I got to a part of the map I shouldn't be. Then exploring a bit more to find that there is a chest at the end and it was actually all planned! That is how I discovered a jumping puzzle and it was fun, the rewards from the chest weren't great, but the puzzle itself was fun.
---
Luckily when theres a festival like halloween, wintersday, new years and so on, theres always a npc where you can rent a mount for a small fee, not sure if you can rent them with a f2p account, but it gives you a good impression of how the mounts are.
---
Off-hand dagger for Ranger sucks quite hard compared to Torch/Warhorn/Axe.
---
 *What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?*
---
Quite a lot PvP/WvW builds use Longbow
---
You can have trial and error w/o having traps hidden, would it be that hard to set up spots that look possible but are just out of range? Because in that situation I would personally would think “oh that was my fault for miscalculation” but when I go down a route only for a trap I couldn’t see to jump out of the ground it just makes me think “how the hell was I supposed to have known that was their” if you’ve ever played actual puzzle platformers they use they concept a lot
---
The craftable ones are 2h primers. BLS is the 12h primers. Like I said, purely convenience of not having to think about food in a long WvW session, it's not particularly cost efficient if that's the goal.
---
Pve uses megaservers so you can play with everything from same region (eu/na). You can also be in a guild with someone from other region.
---
Wvw teams are server based.
---
while i'm not really a social player, i gotta agree.
---
there's barely any chat going on, ever. except of some roleplayers in LA.
---
T4 misters are significantly better at melting trash mobs than people in T3. 
---
Dying is expected for squishy classes in general, I wouldn’t put too much afterthought into it.
---
You seemingly get the mechanics aspect of fractals which is all you need to start working in T4.
---
Probably going to want to use some sort of ranged option in fractals, it’s frequently the best choice during heavy fire, limited space, and good for doing some dps during mechanics kiting.
---
Didn’t see anything about your gear, pots, good/utility set up which may offer up some opportunity to boost your stats, often clearing mobs faster, and as a result taking less damage.
---
Core war for me feels better as ever has been before, also never liker banner slave builds, regards even dislike it more now it dont gives healing anymore.
---
They kind of flutter around, and damage from combo  fields is usually low, so it's easy to overlook them with all the visual noise.
---
What CGI trailer?
---
So how do I make sure a guild I join I can actually play with?
---
Antagonist of the first season.
---
Agree. What's more, what is the point of common armor set. If it would be cool everyone would wear it for quite a long time. If not, why bother.
---
If something is unique, like available for old heroes, then it makes more sense. Virtual scarcity. At the beginning only few can get it, and you cannot speed this up. 
---
Armor or few parts would be great. I will be happy with an outfit too.
---
Your only way to deal some significant damage in pvp is with ranged weapons, specifically scepter/focus (which isnt particularly easy to play effectively) since staff has been nerfed several times. With melee builds you need to have pretty defensive setup because ele is quite squishy, but has strong sustain with heals and evades (but that way you also lose a lot of damage).
---
In pve it's mostly a matter of positioning and build. Staying slightly behind allies should be enough considering you're not playing sword weaver (which isnt a very beginner friendly build to begin with). Check some builds on discretize.eu or metabattle. I generally prefer  sc/wh FA build in fractals.
---
Have you tried remodulating deflector dish to emit a tachyon beam in order to invert the pressure differential?
---
Most groups can make short work of trash by grouping them (either by pull or LoS), using stun/daze/blind/aegis, and bursting them down before they can recover. Or they skip the trash altogether. If you aren't confident, then let someone else take the lead, kill what they attack, and ignore what they don't.
---
If you dont mind me asking, what are the dyes used for the Violet Sabrewing?
---
Yeah, my routine everyday is to go on the Gem Store and go right to the promotions page.
---
The free items are on top. That way you don't miss out on any give away.
---
In Final Fantasy XIV there are glamour items called The Emperor’s New X, one for every slot. It hides the item for that slot.
---
It's Linden, which is basically basswood. They're both from the *Tilia genus.*
---
It kinda bafles me you can hide the headgear, pauldrons and gloves but you can't hide the other parts
---
I agree.  Don't play Weaver without support classes or you'll want to do unpleasant things to yourself.  The class and its rotations are *highly* dependent on good quickness and alacrity up-times.  All it offers is damage for the most part so if you're not in a position to take full advantage of it's robust damage capabilities then you should just play something else.
---
If you want to play Elementalist you should always try and be aware of the Fractal levels themselves, the active instabilities and whether or not you'll have a Chrono/Druid or Firebrand/Ren composition.  You'll want them to thrive.  Fractals with a lot of AoE or condition pressure like Twilight Oasis or Siren's Reef are extremely unfriendly to squishy classes; I really just wouldn't bother trying to play Elementalist here w/ uncoordinated pug groups.  Guardian is a solid class all-round for both DPS and support capabilities.
---
Ask them before joining. Also, ask if they remain on the same server or jump from one server to another every 2 months to play in T1. I joined a guild where they kept changing servers all the time, at one point I just had to say no because i made some friends on the server and decided I want to stick around.
---
An regular wireless microsoft mouse
---
&gt; How much does team comp matter? I see all sorts of videos about speed clears and all that jazz where the team comp is super important, but how much does a PUG group really care?
---
Overall, it's not all THAT important. Some groups will be more strict about their requirements, but other groups are welcoming to pretty much anything. Playing a full meta team with everyone knowing how to play their class will make the run smoother and faster, but it's by no means the only way to clear a fractal run.
---
I don't mind at all! Dye channels are Orchid/Shadow Turquoise/Shadow Turquoise/Indigo.
---
I think 11 million must be concurrent players/active accounts not total sales or accounts, that seems way off for the amount of time it's been around
---
Not GW2 specific interface add-on, but I'd recommend Yolomouse as well. I don't know about anyone else but I can easily lose track of the default cursor when there is a lot of effects going off on-screen. Yolomouse will override ingame cursors with a few styles and colors that stand out much better.
---
Probably PoF sales only, which would make sense
---
Are you on EU or NA? If you are on EU you can hit me up at Cookiepants.9364 and I can help you and give some tips.
---
1. Yes, people get put in the same maps and rewards scale so u find enough people around.
---
2. There is but unless it's a really popular repeatable event u wont find easily people doing the same things as u.
---
3. You get most of ur  endgame gear from crafting but crafting for profit is kinda meh.
---
4. Inflation is controlled by really high (15%) seller's tax so in contrast with other games u cant make enough profit from auctioning which was kind of a bummer for me as i used to put a lot of time and get a lot of money from looking into it in all of my past mmorpgs.
---
5. Raiding is really hard to get into without a helpful clan, people require crazy amounts of experience but if u are lucky u can look for training parties after the resets, u should raid after the resets because as the week goes by less and less parties are doing them.
---
6. Dunno.
---
Quality tip! I was referring to the built-in game one, but this one is a good general one to know for machines running Windows.
---
Good luck!
---
Another old WoW fart, beta to LK. Just some opinions to add...
---
The more you can look at GW2 as its own game and not "like wow except..." the better the transition will be. There's no gear treadmill, there's no sub, you get new content for free every few months, a ton of unlocks are account-wide so alts are very easy. You're constantly, actively being rewarded for playing with random people in the world, so a lot of the zones are at least somewhat populated. When you play a low-level zone you are scaled to that zone's stats but still get loot for your current level. There's a world boss fight every 15 minutes. Some of the zones have events where 100+ people are all working together.
---
Sometimes the class balance is shoddy, though, and the raid scene is kind of a turn-off for me, but that's more from me being old and bitter I guess.
---
I'd never go back to wow, though. I'd miss raptor jumps and beetle races and doing AB, Chak Gherent, or Dragon's Stand with a bunch of other strangers instead of feeling like I had to beg my guild to get stuff done (there IS that too, but it's not as forced for most of the content).
---
How do you figure? I've got it on my calendar right before April 32rd.
---
Honors in Applied Jumping - cause I'm a masochist and REALLY love jumping puzzles
---
No
---
what?  No I'm not saying support the team with boons as a reaper.  I'm saying that if your a dps role in a group, the speed at which your chrono/firebrand gives you quickness effects how good your burst is differently from how it effects firebrand, because necro gives itself quickness the second it enters shroud, for example after orbs phase final boss of 99cm.  If you have a bad chrono, who is trying to get 3 illusions up before they shield 5/cs, the necros burst has an advantage over the dgh.  Does it surpass it?  I don't know.  Thats why I specifically chose my words cautiously, 'something worth considering'.
---
About 4 days ago WoodenPotatoes did a video review on a somewhat hidden Guild Wars 2 cgi trailer with barely any views or publicity of any kind. Aside from the end screen the trailer never actually references Guild Wars 2. It's more cartoony than what we're used to, and it seems aimed at a younger audience with no prior exposure to the game. Putting on his tinfoil hat, WP suspects it may have been developed for a mobile game that was scrapped.
---
This is the single biggest reason I don't raid. I feel like I'd spend a lot of time and in-game wealth converting to whatever is "meta meta meta" right now, get kicked immediately because I missed a mechanic on my first fight, and leave furious and poor because I'd spend all the money again to change my gear back.
---
&gt; Don't get the key, you'll just end up with a very, very expensive ~~Makeover~~ Hair Kit.
---
Oh im sorry, I thought you were talking about like a boss fight.  Yeah for trash mobs, its pretty straight forward thinking on my part, we both agree that necro is great at buffing itself.  My experience has been that often for trash mobs, they might die before a chrono even gets off some quickness skills.  Meanwhile the reaper can enter shroud and hit 4.  It all depends on how long the burst needs to last.  I think the highest instant burst in the game is kitless holo pressing all 3 insta toolbelt skills and sword 2 while above 50% heat, but my experience is trash mobs won't quite die that fast.  However, I think if you had 3 dps power reapers, trash mobs would die in the time of just shroud-&gt;spin.  But it all depends if these are trash mobs during a boss fight, where you actually do usually have boons, or some trash mobs while your running around and wells are useless (a whole other aspect is whether your going chrono or firebrand).

This is the right answer &gt;:D
---
My TP flipping is just baby level to be Baron, maybe I do 30-50 gold on a good day trading in my WvW downtime.
---
&gt; How high do you want them to be
---
High that when I do get drop I do not salvage it because I could not bother make 3 clicks to TP exotic armor for 20s. 
---
Despite your belief high prices is better for ordinary player, because money printing level is defined by Anet via rewards printing gold. It is constant for given player population and hours played. While drop of stuff is the same but on opposite side. Less stuff in game &gt; more demand &gt; higher gold price &gt; **more profitable to do events that drop it for average Joe.**
---
While in the economy where everything is cheap it is easier to be TP flipper, botter, afk events, multi-box metas and etc. Instead of doing stuff let the bots do it and drop price to the level where most of the resources would be vendored. And the only people that would do profit is actual TP barons that can bother to flip thousands of orders with 1-2% profit margin... or bots.

[That looks](https://i.imgur.com/YM1pYzD.jpg) like view from Lion's Arch portal on Gendarran - way too different as everything else in that trailer, especially Sylvari and Rytlock's voice
---
The band one is like trying to form fractal party and realizing people joined and just insta left - all four of them...
---
Ew wow player here from BC to about 3 months ago. I started GW2 when it came out then took a 4 year break.  
---
All your other questions were answered, so all I will add is I do not intend on going back to wow.
---
Yea, like I'm pretty new, only been playing maybe a month or two, so I don't really know the specifics on just how important builds are for stuff like raiding. But I know meta sheep and build elitism and gatekeeping when I see it, and I see it in GW2. 
---
I've been playing a fair amount of sPVP, and I've been running a pretty offmeta build that I've been having a good amount of success with (glint/jalis herald as like a bunkery type thing). A few days ago, I was in a game on Kyhlo and I popped in the trebuchet. One of my teammates told me to leave the trebuchet and go fight because I was big dps, and I said that I wasn't playing shiro. He proceeded to spend the entire match saying "gg rev useless". Like this doesn't really bother me, as I've played so many games with much more toxic people, but I know that for a lot of newcomers to any game, this is the kind of thing that turns them off and pushes them away. And this is just one out of many similar incidents in just the past week or so. It's especially rough to see this in something like PVP, where toxicity is more expected due to the competitive nature, but where player skill should also be much more important than builds.
---
Ok golden key always a BS, tried it twice and got like 2 makeoever i cried a lil.
---
I don't usually throw money on one offs like Zafirah's rifle or celestial compass those things so 35\~60 statuettes I spend on those.
---
The roll this time was kinda decent because I usually only roll 25 at a time and if it doesn't pan out then i say fuck it, but this time round, if I didn't get what I want there was a Zafirah's rifle at 25 statuettes for consolation price haha.
---
I always think all gemstore related items in $$, so 600 gems rifle is like $7.5. Throw 2100 ($26.25) or 25 keys, you have do the math to get make sure u get the same dollar equivalent or you have lost the gamble. If you got at least 1 exclusive dye from the dye kits, then that's like $1.6 etc. I don't mean to rub it in, but I was extremely lucky and got the birb, so that's 2000 gems ($25), bought the rifle as well so I was came out winning the bargain.
---
Then they both did amazing job
---
Short, sweet, and concise. The reason I even started thinking about GW2 was because I still loosely follow WoW you tubers and someone mentioned that new mount system doesn’t hold a candle to GW2, so decided to start researching. Zero intention ever going back to WoW, regardless of wether I start playing GW2 regularly :(
---
It's been my lifelong dream but it will never happen unfortunately. Medium armor suffocates me.
---
Get some skins, or some glider pack. Every now and then some cool stuff will be up for statuettes. If you get literally anything else other than the Golden Key you will most definitely not regret getting it.
---
For maximum duration from runes you actually want Tempest runes but you might not need it.
---
I would have *soooooo* much fun cosplaying as Ruby Rhod.
---
I would have *too* much fun cosplaying as Ruby Rhod.
---
Heck, I might actually start playing humans if I could be Ruby Rhod.
---
And I need to add, the reason I even got this game those years ago was not because of the human character creation.
---
A friend showed me the game and the concept of Charr drew me in.
---
Asura idle and attack animations hooked me for a few more years. So this is not a dig at Anet or a cry for more diversity- rather an appreciation for the attention given to such a topic!
---
I also like the cultural diversity of the game, it's pretty refreshing to see a wider range of human features. 
---
There is one tiny complaint that I have as a player no longer in my teens or twenties. It's pretty difficult to make a character who looks a little older. I know there is an older female face, but it's a little on the elderly side. Every other option just looks so young to me. I would love to see some representations that look like they are in the 30-50 range.
---
Our guild leader does an HP train from VB all the way to DS every Saturday at 3 pm EST.  He doesn't charge a thing.  If you try to give him a tip he'll send it back.  Be at Shipwreck Peak WP and look for Big Mez.  Have fun......its a great run!
---
Escapism probably.
---
This might've been a decent post if you didn't keep trying to slam people in every other sentence.
---
Agreed on that note! Fantasy games with character creation do tend to have the trope of "everyone is young and hot". If there is variation, it would only be the opposite end of the spectrum with an older facial model but still the sculpted body of handsome squidward.
---
Isn't escaping from your actual body, gender, species part of that?
---
You're such a victim, you'll have a better life if you quit perceiving yourself as a victim all the time.   
---
I could say so much more, but i try to keep politics and \*FAKE\* social issues that were socially engineered by communists out of my game reddit.
---
Hi guys.
---
So today I decided to open gw2 again after a break.
---
When I open the launcher and log in the launcher shows a message saying "Thank you for creating a new account. Please activate your account by clicking the button so we can send an email with the link..."
---
The problem is that my account is not new. Is this a problem or a bug? I already made a ticket but I was away for some time, so wanted to know if you guys are aware of something like that happening.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
NA or EU?
---
I can confirm that t3 is harder than t4.
---
It was such a pain to get through t3. Once I stepped into t4 I was surprised how easy fractals are xd
---
I mean you could just as easily say escapism is about inserting your person into a world in which you are powerful, wealthy, etc. Fantasy fulfilment and whatnot
---
Pretty much my issue with the post. "Tyria has Elona, Elonians are canon, your character can be of Elonian descent!" Cool, appreciated, actual diversity and freedom of expression. "BUT YOU NERDS HATE ON POC" - well duh, context, bro?! Yeah, we're against shoving diversity in for diversity's sake where it, thematically and/or historically, makes no sense; but Tyria is alternate reality, likely set in the future, a world with magic where *humans* are the aliens, so why bring it up in this sub for no reason other than for confrontation?
---
I see far, far more people complaining about the people that complain about diversity, than I do actually see people complain about diversity.
---
I’m also starting to dislike the GW2 community, there’s too many people like this in it. I was just on a sub of another game I play and they’re so much more positive and fun than the people here. It’s such s pity because i love this game.
---
10/10 shitpost.
---
for all new guys out there,IF YOU HAVE CHRONO IN GROUP,CHRONO GOES EVERYWHERE FIRST TO PULL MOBS OR CC BOSS. If you gona follow this simple rule,your chance of dying is  90% lower.
---
&gt; the threshold for DPS is very low. Being successful for raids is just knowing mechanics mostly.
---
ehhhhhhhh
---
its certainly lower than many people think/imagine, but I wouldn't go so far as to say its "very low"
---
Work your way towards an Infinite Mist Omnipotion.  Trying to play classes like Thief or Elementalist w/o these is... unwise.  It should be one of your first goals as soon as you hit T3/T4 FoTM; their usefulness is unparalleled and pays for themselves many times over.  Once you have an omni-potion you'll be able to dodge regularly every 10-15 seconds and get in a good rhythm for dmg mitigation.
---
This is the type of response I was expecting tbh. I'm not going to say you wouldn't understand but try putting yourself in someone else's shoes for one moment. Try finding a game where you're able to find yourself accepted into a community. Most gamers use "escapism" to get away from politics and etc. Except, the thing that no one takes into account is that ANYTHING is political. Even movies or art where there is not always a "literal" meaning, there's always something that gets taken home by someone. So maybe try understand that as someone who is in a community that is extremely populated with people I don't look like, what that does to someone growing up? I'm in my mid twenties now and thankfully have the type of mentality where I can identify with any character whether they're gay, straight, trans, white, black, asian, plant-person- as long as they have a compelling story. The issue with MOST fantasy games is that instead of even attempting to write compelling stories of such people, they'll default to tropes. 
---
Seeing that so many people are bothered by my post, maybe as I take a deeper look into myself, others should do the same. I noted that this game company in particular has the conviction to write interesting stories with human characters with varied characteristics WITHOUT dwelling on those characteristics. Only that it was about time with the introduction of the PoF expansion that was when they decided to give humans more nappy hairstyles other than a 70s afro, braids and a buzzcut.
---
I've been 1v2ing on far for the longest time, managed to kill both of them on spb, looked at map and my team managed to lose close and die 4v3 mid :`)
---
There's a lot of people angered and missing the point that I literally mentioned that it's amazing how diverse gw2 humans are.
---
Ty &lt;3
---
I bought 20 normal keys trying to get the mount and got nothing but junk.
---
Bought the golden key and got the hummingbird mount!
---
You're right, I'm very wrong here.  I was under the assumption that patching it and passing the d3d9.dll would work, but I screwed up and it looks like it's broken right now.  So really, all my video does is show how the shader cache affects gameplay on tkg-protonified-4.1.  But in a really long and round about way.
---
Figures nothing is that easy, haha.  I'm just stoked to see so much development happening around this.  I really should have had my coffee before posting!
---
YES.
---
It's not validation issues actually, if you read my other comment clearly about the fact that what drew me into this game was the ability to play non-human characters. Or maybe that I was commending Anet's ability to expand on the character creator.
---
Only ever go far to neutralize it when you have both other bases, they wont be guarding as heavily because they're behind so they're at mid and home, neuting it cause them to take pressure off your guys at home and mid and you demoralize them by falling even further behind
---
I mean, seeing more people complaining about people who complain about diversity than the people who complain about diversity in the first place is just proof of how good the community is, right?
---
I mean, I guess not for the people who hate diversity, but its not like they're not much of a loss.
---
Don't be sorry for something you're not sorry for. It is what it is.
---
I'd love to have more Canthan-themed options for humans one day like what they did for Elonians.
---
Not enough stripper but I did find something revealing enough for my tastes and it's also a [Necro!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/501126217135816753/560970441586376704/gw900.jpg)
---
You make it sound as if there's a gameplay difference between spaghettic noodle arms and super beef gun cannon arms. A tiny little Asura hits as hard as a huge Norn. A skinny human hits as hard as a fat human.
---
I like the armor/weapon unlocks on the last tab.
