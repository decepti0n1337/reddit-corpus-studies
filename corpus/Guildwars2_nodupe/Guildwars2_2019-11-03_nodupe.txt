"No, not to the ascended veterans, to the casuals there."

---
I was done there xD

---
---
The title itself gives an unsettling feeling, nice.
---
The first Beetle skin, the fiery one. Which was about a year ago.
---
Everything of them should be remade. Maybe even with a new engine like Overwatch does it the third time now! 
---
Oh wait.. We're speaking about GuildWars 2...
---
&gt; who are arguably worse than Blizzard
---
Yeah, at least when the sub numbers seriously tank after a failed expansion, blizz at least try to do anything. EA or Anet, on the other hand..
---
They aren‚Äôt leaving because of the release cadence though. It‚Äôs been like this since GW2 launched
---
If you keep your receipt emails or bank statements, go back through and add up how much you've spent during your time playing. You can also use this to find when you've spent the most (say, in the summer, or around wintersday, etc).
---
As always, thanks Kossage!
---
In the Strike Mission, Crecia corrects us when calling the construct an elemental.
---
&gt;	&lt;Character name&gt;: Behind us! Elemental?
---
&gt;	Crecia Stoneglow: That's‚Äîthat's an ice construct.
---
What‚Äôs the difference?
---
Blizzard is arguably now much worse than EA, and go ahead and make EA better than Bethesda too, at least with a $100 sub to EA i can play nearly all their games compared to the FO76 subscription bullshit.
---
Take a look at the necromancer. It has very high sustain, tanking minions, extra health bar, and relatively high damage. I have mesmer, necromancer, thief, guardian, and ranger with the elite specs, and the reaper necromancer is the one I enjoy playing the most.
---
someone give her a revive orb! i know you all have 1, we just got 1 for free.
---
I've said it for years, Guild Wars 2 biggest problem is management. Whoever is making decisions has done so much damage to this brand. I don't know if its the Director(s) or someone above them but management has done so much harm to this game.
---
Also think on this: When a PR nightmare happens who was the person always stepping up to calm the community? It was normally Mike O(it still took him way too long to address whatever issue was going on), not our new director Mike Z. How is the game supposed to do good when our new director can't even step up and reassure the community during the trying times? 
---
What GW2 needs is a FFXIV makeover in terms of management. Yoshida is a freakin' god when it came to turning XIV around and GW2 needs that sort of treatment. It just feels like something is strangling GW2 and its deep rooted in management.
---
"I'm simply trying to encourage discussion by laying out the facts", they say, while offering only speculation and opinions, and almost no facts. I'm not disagreeing with the general idea, I just thought it was a funny choice of words.
---
Of course it wouldn't,
---
 -Increasing the gold cap doesn't magically increase the value of infusions.
---
 -Extreme luxury goods going up in price doesn't devalue currency.
---
His only point was "nothing should cost over 10k" which is an opinion offered with no rational foundation or logic to it. In the absence of any sort of stated rationale for the opinion, the only thing we can conclude is his opinion is based on the idea that "rare things I can't afford is bad for the game because reasons." So, no, I don't feel bad about belittling such a myopic opinion.
---
This also has a bit of a precedent in Norse mythology--Thor slays Jormungandr during Ragnarok, but dies from its venom after taking 9 steps.
---
Some things should be real money only. I appreciate the gold to gem conversion, but it's far too lenient for some things, like bundles or special promotions.
---
An elemental is a naturally occurring creature while a construct is an artificial one.
---
People used to get downvoted for pointing this out. I guess the tide has turned. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I want a private jet, but can't afford one, private jets need to be cheaper. You just don't understand, Nike.
---
No matter how you feel about decisions regarding a game, personal attacks on people and how they dress just makes you seem like a terrible person.
---
No idea why you're being downvoted. You're right. They said they haven't ruled it out, ergo possible. Wouldn't get your hopes up, of course, but still, people seem so incredibly adamant they absolutely arent coming. If I was a developer and saw that pessimism, Id make it a point to say nothing and then surprise drop all new especs, just to prove the pessimists wrong.
---
.. with the approval of management. Management always seems to ruin good surprises and such.

You can visit [the archive page for the Corsair Prisoner](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/User_talk:Regina_Buenaobra/Archive_Game_Related_Topics/July_2008#Corsair_Prisoner) to see the walls of text that led to Anet changing this back in 2008.
---
Yes - but ectos are not guaranteed, so it's still a gamble. Checking the prices right now, 
---
* per http://gw.zweistein.cz/gw2ecto/ calculator, "Rare item needs sell for less than 16s  91c to be worth it to salvage it"
---
* per https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/83008-Piece-of-Rare-Unidentified-Gear the box instantly sells for 17s 77c
---
So, depending on how lucky you are, identifying that piece of rare gear may be a gain or loss... although the difference is not that big, frankly.
---
We‚Äôre in agreement, then.
---
Didnt have access to those specifics, just a basic overview from the department that handled it. 
---
I was supposed to help 'fix' their CS integration, and it was mostly a lost cause.
---
They've already tried doing that, people still found ways past/over them
---
Leather is still fucked from the HoT release leather fix **four years ago**.
---
That was amazing!
---
EAnet its in the gemstore
---
Of course it is, they're the parent company. I don't know what you expect.
---
Christ this is like activision bad, blizzard good all over again.
---
have you tried playing another game?
---
And please add: you can assign a standard one for pve/pvp/www which automatically gets activated once joining pvp f.e., like it used to be before templates were a thing. Extremely annoying having to switch everytime. Just worse than before
---
&gt;At the very least they need to switch away from load outs
---
So "at the very least" they need to redo the whole system?
---
Hi guys im really new to Guild Wars 2 and i was planning to buy the 1 collection of 40 usd cause i want to play the lore and dungeons of the first part but my questions is, if a buy it I will use the same launcher of arena net or do i need to get another program like Steam in order to run the game?
---
I think quite a few people activated build 4 as soon as templates came out.
---
BLAARGHHHH WARRRHHGARBLLLL VOTE WIT YER WALLET DED GAEM DON'T SUPPORT SLEAZY ANET MONTEZATYUN!!!!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
kidding.  hi, op.  give swagger a bifrost.
---
In terms of bugs:
---
* They shouldn't mess up the order of utility skills on Revenant.  
---
* They should remember what armor pieces are hidden.  
---
* It shouldn't default to using the 2nd weapon set when switching equipment.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Features:
---
* I do think you should have a separate set for the PvP gamemodes. At least 1 hidden one for each mode that only activates when you go there.
---
* Storage is made almost completely useless by the existence of a text file on your computer. Not a feature request, I just still think it's funny.
---
In my case, to stay safe, I stick to a single class so I can learn it well and then continued doing the story until i finished it. By then I had better knowledge of the game and its maps and mechanics. I did map metas and eventually got into fractals and I‚Äôm grinding my way up.
---
First thing I did after I got to 80 was to get all my gear exotic following a meta build from metabattle.
---
Getting into ascended gear was pretty confusing, I had to watch youtube videos, and all of them talked about how many ways there is to get and I couldn‚Äôt seem to get into one. So I went in and crafted it, I found two very useful websites for that, it was pretty expensive though, but I don‚Äôt see any other way since I don‚Äôt get i to pvp.
---
I heard it's also how you get free gold.
---
I **want** them to make build templates free and, refund the gems people have spent. (Note: I'm referring to skill/trait templates. I'm fine with charging for equipment tabs.)
---
I **expect** nothing.
---
Expectations? None.
---
Hopes? 
---
1. Limit template switching in WvW to spawn, or give it a CD.
---
2. Make them actually work properly in PvP and not just partially.
---
3. Make the save-able tab per character instead of account wide
---
The rest I‚Äôm more or less content with, if they make the Saved builds tab work on a per char basis, even with 2 builds you can afford to switch them around easy enough. You‚Äôre unlikely to need more than 2 builds at the same time on a hotkey. Especially if you can just swap one of those 2 with relative ease from the saved builds.
---
And if you do, well that falls under convenience which is part of the gem store‚Äôs purpose.
---
* Original Digital Deluxe version of the base game at launch.
---
* Some gems to buy LWS2 episodes.
---
* HoT shortly before PoF released. I think I got them both as a bundle deal for the release of PoF.
---
* PoF digital Deluxe Edition.
---
Everything else has been gold--&gt;gems.
---
Im expecting an edit toggle and fixes(not resetting upgrades when swapping)/qol for legendaries. Like maybe favs for stat sets and legendary upgrades that you could maybe even access by right clicking an item? Maybe thats going too far but thats about it.
---
Maybe improvements to the equipment tab, filters for greens etc.
---
There seems to be a lot of stress on the servers so the 10 templates might not even become a thing.
---
That's good info. I hadn't ever mathed it out that much. Thanks for doing the numbers üëç
---

---
Is this the new login music?
---
My only experience with people in online games is as i told. They make games not fun and frustrating.
---
"  how people can make this game fun for you " what do you mean by that?
---
I took some time. I wasn't playing for like 1-2 years.
---
Seems only way.
---
I expected challange. But not like "you must do same thing over and over for a month". That's job not a challange in game. I already got a job, i don't play games to do another job.
---
Lots. I thought about coming back to GW2, because it used to be fun, but it's not anymore.
---
I hate that kind of argument. It's like saying 'you don't like anal because you've never had good anal'. That's bullshit argument.
---
Get her into Archeage or Destiny 2, both are MILES better at this point, and deffinitely not P2W.
---
What's RMT stand for?
---
HEY FREAKSHOW!
---
Expansion tier feature. We already had skins in the game that cost 2000 gems, which is 25 to 30‚Ç¨. That's already the price of PoF without any shenanigans. 
---
The only difference is that people not interested in tossing gold bricks at Anet didn't have to. Now they are semi forced into a crap overpriced system, if they don't want to go back to switching characters every 5 minutes.
---
You looked in the wrong place for challenge, then. If it was challenging *on top of* being a grind, the complaints would never end.
---
I agree that it's mind numbing, but that's the only thing worth complaining about. Things like cost is irrelevant because of the quality of the item.
---
If you prefer a monthly fee...
---
They're still giving all you need for free.
---
That Error should can be ignored. It should work anyway.
---
If you're getting stomped by a 10 year old with all the time in the world, that's a you problem. The game is not at fault.
---
What livestream? Did they show anything else?!? And I LOVE the boneskinner
---
The first fix should be to make a "save" button, this is crucial for moving leg gear around. If u remove your leg trinkets and put them on another character, the stats you had are immediately "forgotten". This completely erases the template functionality. The same goes for pretty much every change you do.If u switch to a build and tweak it a bit for a certain encounter you shouldnt have to remember what the original was, we need a save function. This also goes for ascened gear, traits,utilities. 
---
This along with the ridiculous monetization were the worst parts for me. A template that cant be permanently saved is not a template to begin with.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, actually. If they have been around for the games life, eventually they will get bored and move on. The game can only survive on its good qualities for so long before players move on. 
---
I tried coming back to this game this month and gave up after reading through the hopelessness and witnessing this egregious shitshow of an update.
---
... The live stream literally had the devs say they were limited on how they could build this system because of inventory code restrictions. We already knew technical limitations were there.
---
The developers only put a certain amount of a thing into the game, the cost of buying it goes up, but it's entirely arbitrary based on the amount of the thing the developers choose to put into the game.
---
That's talking about real world economies, in which supply is limited by the nature of reality. That does not apply in any way to video games, in which supply is entirely at the discretion of the developers.
---
It was mentioned in the latest patch notes.
---
&gt; There's no real progress in it. ... Open world is pointless and boring doing solo.
---
Frankly, no vertical progress and emphasize on Open world is two major features of GW2, that's what make it different from other MMOs. If you do not like that, then I think this game is not for you.
---
I know that, but lots of people denied it despite what was said because it wasn't the developer saying it directly.
---
Another side of  that is that if you bought WoW or Final Fantasy and you paid a sub for 4 months, you'd have paid as much as it costs to get every single bit of content in Guild Wars 2.  I mean the 2 expansions are only $30 at full price now, you're probably at $70 or $80 all up for everything.
---
That's very little money for the content on offer, with a sub or even an optional sub.
---
What? One of the coders who built the system was the one who said it.
---
Pull up that stream again and check for it. The developer says an indefinite about if they will be able to increase how many will be available. The community manager lady (I usually know her name but it's late) says something about it "getting code scary" at higher numbers, and the developer gives a mostly neutral passive agreement response.
---
I absolutely agree that that most likely means that there are stability issues at higher numbers, but it was not explicitly stated, so the people with a bias towards "anet bad" mentality in this use that as leverage to say it's an interpretation, not and explicit statement.
---
Unless you have a clip or timestamp that says otherwise?
---
Halloween‚Äôs been out for a while.
---
i dont think the mothly sub is worth it at all. thats my main issue with that game and why i never bothered to get hardcore at it
---
Not trying to be snarky but maybe you should try single player games instead if you don't like playing with people? You're never gonna get the most out of an MMO if you're ignoring the community aspect.
---

---
Do another one, then report back! :3
---
So apparently there is a way to change what alt f4 does it is somewhere in the settings
---
Whatever you decide, make sure you check out metabattle.com for Open World builds. This will help you optimize your traitline and gear selection. 
---

---
[Open World Scrapper](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Scrapper_-_Barrier_Bruiser)
---
My Alt Account has never spent a dime on the game except for the upgrades to HoT and PoF. I have had several weird issues with that one and almost always get CS response within 1 or 2 days. My main account, I've spent more than I care to admit because of an obsession with mounts and buying stuff, and one time I accidentally bought a mount skin bundle that I already had, when I meant to buy another sitting next to it, and it took them 5 days to answer my ticket. Sooo I I do not know how much your theory holds water, but it probably depends on what the issues are and what other stuff they are dealing with at the time.
---
Hey it could be worse. They could be wasting resources on modes like WvW, Raids and PvP that no one of importance actually cares about.
---
Guardian is the best class in the game by landslide. It's meta in every mode and has builds for all roles.
---
It's also very strong solo.
---
Thief (daredevil spec) it's the best solo class, if it's soloeable thief can do it.
---
RWBY reference?
---
10/10 lmao.
---
Then it's probably worth trying a change.  Thief and Guardian should provide you options for easier rotations, and since you play Elementalist the low HP on both classes won't be anything unusual for you.
---
You can also go to the DPS Training Arena and just practice your rotations on the golem there until they improve, but that will only do so much.  Doing your rotation on a golem that stands still and doesn't fight back is quite different than doing your rotation in the middle of a fight where you have to worry about various mechanics and actively try to stay alive as well.  Still, practice is practice.
---
especially by playing wvw, you easily can get more hero points that u ever could wish / need. i have 4/5 char slots atm and i leveled the 4th with only "level-books" (tomes) and her hero points fully with what you can trade the wvw ones for.   
---
on 2nd main char (engi) i messed up, she has 200 extra hero points despite maxed out skill-lines lul
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
correct me if im wrong, but that post was supposed to have all the changes from feedback reflected as well.
---
both thief classers are crazy in dps-output, but severly broken and likely to get hit sooner or later by some pretty hurting nerf. (depends how long anet smokes their pot)
---
pvp /1v1 wise i feel rather that deadeye is way more dangerous and common than daredevil acutally, but idk.
---
It was their choice, in 2012, to use those microtransactions rather than a subscription fee.  That's similar to what they did with Guild Wars 1, though it wasn't a true MMORPG (Diablo, a game it had more in common with than World of Warcraft, likewise had no subscription fee).  And funnily enough, inventory space was probably even more of a problem in Guild Wars 1, though the microtransaction solutions to mitigate that were basically non-existent, beyond "buy more bank panes/new character slots".  It took until 2019 for them to really address the limited inventory...
---
But yeah, that's how we get an MMORPG without paying a subscription fee.  You can say you want more frequent expansions and/or a subscription fee, you want to throw money at them to get content, but not everyone is going to be on board with that.  There are plenty of people who only play GW2 because there's no subscription fee and wouldn't play it if it got one.  As for expansions, I'm sure there'll be one after Season 5, but they're not going to reveal that until we get to the end of Season 5, because they never announce expansions until they're going to be the next content update.  That's just how they've always done business in GW2.
---
This is fantastic. I use a similar website for my ESO characters, so this gives me a great idea of how to build my character once I hit 80. Thank you for linking these for me!
---
i've chosen it kinda blindly 1 year ago as my first MMO, and i still like it. 
---
it has its flaws, but which game doesn't?
---
what's really nice: it has tons of content and a lot of variety of things to explore.
---
Selling build templates for the price of an expansion is a logical next step from their current gem store practices. It's just another instance of them selling a solution to a problem they created:
---
* Sick of constantly replacing gathering tools? Buy a set of infinite use tools for 3000 gems.
---
* Clogging your inventory with 25-use salvage kits? Buy an infinite use salvage kit for 800 gems.
---
* Not enough inventory space? Buy a bag slot for 400 gems per slot per character.
---
* Bank space, material storage, more crafting disciplines, etc.
---
Their build templates system is not the first crap overpriced system in the game, it just hurts more than these other examples because people were used to the superior free version. From their perspective, if these other things are acceptable why shouldn't they try to make a killing off of build templates?
---
I also think selling 2000 gem skins in the gem store is a problem. For example, it seriously sucks that all the mount and glider skins (sans legendary) are bought exclusively through the gem store rather earned through story, raids, fractals, "quests", etc. Part of the fun with skins is the process of acquiring them, and the micro-transaction business model has ruined that as well.
---
And don't even get me started on the gambling.
---
Why should we have to spend an obscene amount of money (or in-game gold) to solve intentionally frustrating problems invented by Anet so they could sell us the solution.
---
It's a mild convenience if you like doing the boss trains. I think I got it for 400 gems? Can't remember.
---
Yeah they are 400. I maybe formulated in wrong, wanted to show that i could also buy up to 600 if needed.
---
If your intention is farming gold, check [these](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bqPlQu6Nsl8B7e4Gz3BMVyxx_HljibRKqIE6z6ka_IA/edit#gid=1063164412) instead.
---
If you just want to do them because they're fun, then indeed it's better to use [/wiki event timers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers) or [gw2timer](http://gw2timer.com/) because that'll get repetitive after a while anyway and you'll find yourself having wasted that gold/cash.
---
Oh wow. Thanks a million
---
[ Everyone likes this ]
---
I've found it pretty handy for when I''m just doing daily's like lumber farm and vistas etc. If for example a quick boss like jungle wurm or FE pops up, I'll usually port there and do them. I probably wouldn't bother doing them at all tbh if I didn't have the portal, so in that case for 400 gems it's one of the more reasonable purchases in the gem store.
---
True , its literally a click on a site and i would also know

This build is literally immortal in pve, since the enemies are either stunned, blind, or you are invulnerable (and also has insane life leech).

Daredevil is a straight upgrade. Get berserker gear, don't be afraid you won't be a glass cannon, youll be a diamond one.
---
They weren't removed, but put on the build storage. I had the same issue on my PvP game and I can assure you it was a real pain in the ass at first.
---
The main reason I play this game is to raid. Since it usually makes use of the combat system and it's challenging. If you've joined a guild for that purpose and don't have fun then the game isn't for you. This game is all about horizontal progression, not vertical like WoW or FFXIV.

"The technology just isn't there yet."

"It just isn't there yet....shhht (ps: Buy more gems. Not for upright Charrs though.)"

I didnt misuse it tho, I used it for emphasis which is 100% fine because as you said, dictionary
---
sea of thieves hasn't exactly fixed their problems, they are doing something similar to anet (boring updates that are just reskins of stuff already in the game) while tall tales was a good addition, since then it's just been the same old crap with a different colour. the community is shrinking because of that and they have also had issues where a certain streamer had special lines of communication with dev/s and was able to get players banned for "stream sniping" (which wasn't against the ToS at the time) they've since updated the ToS to include stream sniping but it still remains something that is very hard to prove. the players were unbanned, only after community backlash and even then, the same person was caught trying to get more people banned a couple weeks / month ago, yet again rare was silent and offered no apology for either incident. the game is dying because the devs seem to think streamers are the top priority while they release mediocre and boring updates.
---
You know this would be an option, right? As in, not forced on you?
---
Charr spend nearly all of their time on two feet already, and are able to run on two feet. You do it all the time in combat. Their body supports the ability to stand fully upright. They do it during many, many animations, and it looks very natural. In fact, being on all fours is the least natural state of a charr, because of how seldom they actually do it. They've evolved well into tool usage, they're firmly bipedal creatures.
---
And they don't need to walk around hunched over to be able to run on all fours, either. They literally just bend down and do it regardless of how they were standing.
---
So yeah. I'm a charr main, all my characters are charr, and I would switch all of them to standing upright if I was given the option.
---
What??? Drop the 1-hour-long cutscenes releases and start working on PvP and WvW, where people can be entertained for months and years with even a single new map? That can't be right.
---
are the devs not on a fixed income? i don't see where the extra cost would come from if you put them to work rather than have them doing a couple LS episodes every few months with a lot of gem store in between.
---
Well we know this episode will have part of a new map, my prediction Eye of the North. The strike mission in the prologue will be updated, a new strike mission in the boneskinner is coming. I predict a fractal, possibly the start of generation 3 legendary weapons, updates and fixes to templates. Things I hope will happen stress tests of swiss tournaments as announced in the August 30th presentation and a new raid.
---
The leap of the cat tonic is extremely useful in certain scenarios
---
Run through the story, explored the new map and did a few of the achievements. 3-4 days of casual gaming, around 4-5 hours at best.
---
Episode 5 of season 4 released on January 8th so your argument is irrelevant.
---
Ouff. Long Time ago. I think buying PoF (normal edition) was the last time, and if you exclude the expansions it was years ago buying that bouquet of red roses for my GF.
---
I agree with your first statement fully. If I'm not mistaken the arc templates allowed you to swap in your territory but it was on a delay and you couldn't swap at all in an enemy territory. The instant sealing while you ate running around can not be allowed. It gives people unfair advantages in a competitive game mode.
---
This isn‚Äôt a service that should be sold though. I regularly bought gems. $20-25/month. Which ever the bracket was. I did it because I cared about the game and wanted it to succeed. 
---
Limiting this service is scummy. Removing pvp builds to to force it is even worse. 
---
Anet has degraded over the years. the shift in focus from making a good story driven game to printing money is makes me sad.  
---
I loved the game but I no longer support it.
---
They said in the 30th August presentation that the strike mission in the prologue will be updated in episode 1 and the boneskinner will be a new one that stalks you in the night.
---
Why don't you just quit instead of coming every few months whining that there is little content. There is plenty of content.
---
Oh I definitely think its a good idea to raise supply, don't know why you think I'm against that.  But rather than chase a pipe dream that seems to me will never happen, I'd rather get a solution implemented before the game goes on full blown life support.  
---
The 10k cap was implemented 7 years ago I believe.  Inflation is a persistent phenomenon.  It makes perfect sense that the cap needs to be raised every once in a while.
---
Or use TacO.
---
The removal of both auto-switching to pvp and wvw is sooooo stupid.
---
That's a very interesting question.  You would still be pressing one key per action, but the single key on your keyboard is dynamically changing to be the correct key for your rotation.  
---
I have no idea. I really doubt Anet will answer it for you.  Good luck =/
---
Yeah that lady is pretty crazy. Like holy hell
---
&gt;WP: *"I'll just use gold I earn to buy Gems"*
---
Has anyone done an estimate on how much gold it'll take to max out slots?
---
what kind of player needs to max out all the slots on all of their characters? if someone does so much content that they have need of all of these things, then they'll most likely have the resources to buy all of these templates.
---
I think it was 19k for 9 chars
---
On the one hand you complain theres nothing to work towards, but then legendaries are too much of a grind for you.
---
On the one hand you want a challenge, but PvP is too challenging for you.
---
On the one hand you want to play an MMORPG, but not with other people.

You, my friend, have a serious problem.

* If you are casual open world player not focused on speedkilling and play with friends I would recommend picking Scrapper first. You could maintain a role of melee brawler with stupid survivability. 
---
* If you want to get ready for endgame team PvE content, maybe pick Holosmith first and try to get more glass cannon-ish build. You will kill things faster but also die faster if not experienced. 
---
While both scrapper and holo can pick ranged weapons too, holosmith still needs to get close to enemy to fully use its class mechanic. Also all it's traits benefits this "holoforge" so maybe don't try to make ranged holo.
---
Remember that core engineer is still very good because of more versatility and ranged options. If you want ranged engi and don't need any of scrapper traits then go for core. Hope it helps.
---
Like I need so many
---
its not off topic drama, 1/3 stuff on the TP is from RMTers , botters and hackers and you're saying that Anet is trying to prevent RMT with the TP when it doesn't work, it literally just spits out new items when you put in so hacked account's items get transfered around without a problem
---
also by your logic someone could buy stuff from the RMT , then send it to thousands of people be it 1 gold bar or some bs and they should all get flagged for RMT and such bs
---
You need about 1.1k gold to max out a character's templates (not buying any account storage).

**THIS!** I've always wanted to have a Charr caster styled like the original Guild Wars' Charr Wardkeepers. Tiger stripes, tall and proud, shamanistic attire and then rain some hell down upon the enemies **in style**!

Too bad it's only a tiny minority that actually enjoy those snorefests.

One thing to remember though is that subscription models actually incentivize the company to get you to pay the subscription but not actually play the game. It‚Äôs the health club model, and a well known business practice. They provide just enough content to string you along, but they lose money the more you play.

Turns out closest Quiznos too me is 104 miles away, didnt even know we had them in the UK lol. Never heard of it
---
Anet, are you watching? I want this. Okay thanks!
---
Don't tag it NSFW if it is not NSFW. This isn't a children's day-care. People can handle seeing a pixilated semi-nude in-game character...
---
I don't have much to say about the trait templates other than it's simply greed on anet's part to charge for them.
---
As for the gold cost...maybe we have different definitions of what ridiculous is, but gold is basically free. I earn ~25g a day just doing my dailies, fractals and crafting, which takes not more than 2 hours. that means I earn roughly 175g a week, so I can basically play casually for a week and buy a template if I want. I don't see how this is ridiculous at all. Only being able to have 6 loadouts is much more limiting than the cost of the loadout itself imo
---
If 10 thousand whales use this to max out their slots and 20 thousand people who don't buy gems anyway stop playing as a result, that's a net gain.  More income, less spent on compute and bandwidth.
---
It's a hit any financial director would be wiling to take.
---
[removed]
---
No I'm not a cynic I know the difference between hopes, predictions and confirmed things. If a raid isn't in episode 1 I'll be fine because I didn't predict it.
---
That was literally my first thought when I made a charr back in 2012. I was devastated that my proud fire elementalist had to run like a cat.
---
Players also wanted build templates, and ANet delivered. Do you want to see how badly they'd fuck up charr's posture?
---
One failing company makes a shitty deal with another failing company.
---
Nothing about this is surprising.
---
was it actually JUST ruby for 24 hours? I would think a company would have multiple employees do the stream taking shifts...
---
ANet's marketing performs on the same level as the rest of departments.
---
No there were other devs but from what she said the other devs kicked her out and sent her to get some sleep but she couldn't get to sleep.
---
It would be cool to have this as an option. In the meantime, we do have /crossarms - there's a reason why so many charr players love that emote.
---
wth is wrong with the shading on that tonic model?  
---
  
---
it looks like when you mod a game and your texture gamma settings are way off, and the material properties get messy.
---
How do u get this tonic?
---
I'd like that, but let us retract the claws too!
---
My problem isn't with the announcement, beyond my general distaste for marketing spiel meant to excuse/cover greed. I brought up how build storage was explained in it to contrast to the reality of it being more of a crutch for, and excuse to double-monetize, the poorly implemented system. The announcement is not the real problem there, neither is the idea behind build storage. The crap build templates and monetization (of both parts) are the problems.
---
The only difference made by my being optimistic about this is the fact that I'm bringing up this exact thing now, instead of last month. Which is why the announcement/etc don't really matter, in the context of whether feedback is valid. Without any of the pre-release info, I would have the same issue with it. I just wouldn't have the example to point at to show how this idea of "build storage is for sharing" is just a thinly veiled attempt to hide that they are just trying to double-dip into players' pockets.
---
I was going to say that build storage is the veil, but the reality here is that build storage is the *real* build saving system. Build templates are just the same old PVE/WVW/PVP build separation slapped into a new UI, with added some greed on top. For anyone that plays all 3 game modes, build templates are nothing more than a ***loss*** of functionality(auto swapping) with an option to buy more pointless tabs. ~~Giving us~~ re-purposing existing build templates is nothing more than an attempt to cover the fact that all we really got is 3(6 if you're playing now) account-wide template saves, with the option to by more overpriced slots...and a limit that still makes the whole damn thing worthless for a lot of us.
---
Ask support, should be doable since it is nothing that affects game economy.
---
changing one skill or having a "jumping puzzle build" doesnt count.
---
You want them to feed their families with pixels? What's wrong with you?
---
Ye, in the video he sounded like he thinks community is in outrage because Arc templates are suddenly gone (among other things). Well, arc templates were gone 2 weeks prior the official release, so certainly didn't happen suddenly.
---
There is a good guide on getting ascended gear on the wiki:  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So\_You\_Want\_To\_Gear\_a\_Character](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character)
---
1 for pve,1 for pvp and 1 for wvw? :D
---
He was quick to label everything negative as "whining," while basically saying, "not my problem!" and that he was glad that he had missed the drama.  He didn't really have anything insightful to say.
---
So that depends, berserker gear is very cheap and easy to get since it is a core stat. The named armor pieces I linked are all ~1-2g per part and even the exotic weapons are cheap, I could help you get set up with suggestions on what to buy and everything. Expansion stats can be a little harder and you would need to farm stat selectable exotic gear (like bladed armor, check the guide), craft it (that need recipes and costs a lot), or get ascended gear (not very useful since that's a lot of gold or the places that already want you geared like fractals and raids). The lunatic gear costs much less and saves you lots of materials vs crafting the harder to get stat sets and can select all stats so it's very valuable. I would especially suggest unlocking the chest recipe since that's the hardest one to get with bladed armor.

Then just leave if you are not happy with what they release instead of spreading negativity over and over again. Its okay to give negative, constructive critisism but dont just complain about literally everything.

---
You have the whole of LS3, Path of Fire and LS4 to work through, although you might have to pay for some of it (depending on what you have). 
---
Fractals are a good way to get back into the harder PvE parts of the game.
---
What daily routine of 20 minutes gives you 33 gold?
---
The q is literally there to place you with just as unskilled players as you. If someone rages they are likely even worse than you.
---
&gt;And since they havent tinkered with the drop rates signifcantly, we can assume that normal market influences are at work.
---
But the market is always a *reaction* to the drop rates *they* set. The market is *inevitable,* unless the devs choose to change things. So the developers said "we *want* this item to be very expensive," and then so it is. The players had no say in the matter, no player can choose whether it be expensive or not, the price is a reaction to the supply/demand ratio that the developers set, so calling it a "market economy" is nonsense. At best it would be the worst sorts of markets, like the Chicago onion market. 
---
&gt;But really, just because they CAN change the drop rate isnt an argument that they SHOULD change the drop rate. Not a single person advocating that position has offered anything close to a compelling reason to do so that would improve the game. I'll keep waiting.
---
It would mean that more of the people who want the item would have it. That is an *objectively* better outcome, no "compelling argument" is needed. If that doesn't interest you, then it indicates that you care more about manipulating markets than you do about players enjoying the game, and that is not a compelling argument to me.
---
Seems to work way better, condi generation is better, and im learning the rotations.
---
Manage to pull a 2v3 + Npcs in front of a t3 tower and kiting as Well.
---
Now it still doesnt feel up to par with said other classes with easier access to other condi like burning (good scaling), but its good for roaming i would say, even thought i feel the class overall even when geared right a bit squishy (but it might just be that i keep forgetting to swap stances often for the energy proc)
---
Probably need some scuba gear!
---
That's why i'm a asking.
---
Oh wow. Yeah, it's sad that anet would team up with such a slimy company.
---
There are plenty of non-casuals who don‚Äôt mess around with mods. Dunno why everybody‚Äôs always lumping the majority together as all casuals. Excuse the common player for not wanting to risk bans.
---
You know Anet spells it out for you in their TOS and mod devs **always** point it out: ‚ÄúUSE AT YOUR OWN RISK‚Äù
---
Like what part of ‚Äúat your own risk‚Äù do you guys not understand? Then you come here and cry when you get banned.
---
Yep indeed.
---
What do you mean? Don‚Äôt tell me they took away the build switching thing upon entering pvp and wvw...? They can‚Äôt do that right come on
---
What? 
---
Unpopular opinion: Unpopular opinion posts are mostly popular opinions including what i just typed.
---
Stop reacting to trolls telling random shit, is not so hard.
---
They did. The "free" build loadouts are just WvW and PvP builds without autoswitching.
---
Remember when people used to complain how mount bundles/skins/licences were too expensive and no one would buy them?
---
How many of those did we have in gem store since PoF?
---
It actually wasn't sarcasm. All I ever did was swap offhands and manually swap 1 to 3 pieces between knights and berserker stats. I didn't really care enough to play condi tank at all and for w5 I'd manually swap stuff to minstrel for boss 1 to 3. I'd never change my runes and swapping sigils isn't really required either. Basically, if you're one of those guys stuck playing chrono for every boss, there was no need for arc dps at all.
---
What I hoped from templates was to allow me to save a wvw build, condi tank and mirage. Currently, with 2 free slots, all I saved besides full berserker chrono is full minstrel chrono minus the weapons cause the way it's implemented constantly unequips upgrades.
---
Why would you need to max out slots? How is that a counter argument?
---
I'd like to know as well, but T4's and CMs net a nice profit for an hour or so tops, T4s alone take 24-40 min depending on party and is an easy 25g, CMs usually add another 5-10g especially if you sell the decorations and can be completed in an hour, less if you have a good party.
---
People bought a 100$ pack giving them broken servers, stash destroying items, and a cool crosshair on them for all to see and hunt down in an unplayable game.   
---
Why do you think people won't buy build templates?
---
Well it is whining. Just look at these comments
---
Omg... 
---
Now I regret having told my 10 year wow friend to try gw2 and said gw2 is the best mmo ever... omg I‚Äôm so embarrassed
---
Well they can't bear to hear an opinion against the hive mind.
---
'Use at your own risk' means they won't help you if you cry to the support you're crashing or your game is lagging.   
---
'It's illegal and you'll get banned' means it's illegal and you'll get banned.
---
Everybody always wants to attach specific meaning to it, but there‚Äôs a reason why they don‚Äôt elaborate. ‚ÄúAt your own risk‚Äù means **at your own risk**. It means no matter what happens as a result of mod usage **nobody else** is responsible for what happens to your account or any of your software or hardware as a result but **you**.
---
I should be more clear. The ‚Äúaverage person‚Äù is anyone who utilizes build templates and wants numerous builds, which could be raids, fractals, WvW or something else, maybe. Most of these people aren‚Äôt rich by any means. The cost is 750g per character for equipment slots by themselves.    And that might not even include all their builds. It‚Äôs a huge paywall for players to just play the game like they used to.
---
The only argument I could see for this price is to burn most of the player base in favor of whales and that might offset them.
---
What exactly did you love about the game? and How long ago was this?
---
The game hasn't changed as far as i know.
---
Thats a really odd comparison given that gw2 doesnt have the exclusivity and rammifications of said 100$ pack. Would people look at you with disgust if you bought a 2000 gem build template pack? No cause they wouldnt know and wouldnt give 2 shits. Unless you want to.
---
2000 gems for a mount skin is ok in my eyes.
---
Having to pay thousands of gems just to make a mandatory new feature actually useable is not.
---
It's ok it's only a few gems and i'm quitting when diablo 4 ) / overwatch 2 anyway.(hope it's soon and not 4 years). 
---
I'm  already playing 1/4 of the time i used to
---
Karmawhoring is all i see here.
---
Yeah, I know this not unpopular, that's me being facetious. With the new season, I'm seeing a lot of my teammates calling each other out. Sometimes sitting out of the game after the first 50 points and berating someone.  
---
Regular posts here show the usual vitriol in screencapped PMs, e.g. the "you're in the wrong place, this is RANKED pvp" post. Maybe if it's not unpopular, those of us in the majority can speak up once in a blue moon. I've never once seen a teammate shut down a troll, and I know it doesnt pay to engage. While it won't mean much to the troll, it is a signal to everyone else there that calling out people for being unskilled or making mistakes is a garbage take.
---
Well the issue they have is that, because the population is so low, low skill players get matched with higher skill players and bring down the quality of the match.
---
Well i find quite hypocritical the whole build templates segment. Yes, he can't argue for the monetization -which is disgustingly high by the vast majority of players and punishing for the players who play a lot- but he made a video a while ago saying how awesome would the templates be, since you could have many build as ressing builds, open world builds, niche builds and how much the system would open new build possibilities etc, which is not the case anymore since the system is very very restrictive. Instead of pointing that out he just said "I don't mind - manually- swaping gear and traits around" which is pretty PATHETIC (you cant even do that effectively because the system is a fcking loadout and not templates)
---
it's not a counter argument, it's an aspect that can help getting a more complete perspective on the topic.
---
I think arenanet's biggest mistake wasn't necessarily making the build template system the way it was, but allowing the players to use third party build templates which are FREE + superior and now are *seemingly* taking that ability away. 
---
It's frustrating, but I also imagine Anet would make an announcement before blanket banning people for using third party templates because that would absolutely destroy  a core part of the guild wars 2 community and cause a huge drop in their revenue
---
It's like WP doesn't understand nuance. The fact that they "had to obviously" monetise templates in some ways does not mean that you have to accept egregious triple monetisation, and per-character monetisation. I think most people expected some kind of monetisation to come with it, but come the fuck on.
---
Also, how out of touch can a person be? "They're fine to me because I have 40 character slots and tonnes of gold!" Yes, *but you're the 1% of the 1%*! It's all fair and well for him to hold that opinion, but maybe you should try to at least see the other side of the argument before you dismiss it as internet whining?
---
Agreed
---
Overwatch 2 is propably a 50$ story dlc. You will get access to all new heros and maps with Overwatch 1 and play against OW2 players.
---
Is the build posted anywhere? I'd like to try Holosmith.
---
The original likely takes the piss with the $999 Apple desktop stand.
---
Several Quiznos in my state are permanently closed too, but the real kicker is that the closest open location has poor reviews for not honoring promotions...
---
You have a very broad definition of mandatory.
---
First: I love the distinction you make between "veterans" and "casuals". There are plenty of casuals that are veterans. Did you mean "hardcore players"?
---
Secondly: Arcdps doesn't work on Mac, so I'm glad there's a native solution for me now. I'm not buying more of them because I'll wait for a sale (&amp; some necessary bugfixes and updates) - but to me, it's not that bad. It's already an upgrade to the previous situation. Also, to all the players who now can't play because they don't have access to their 16 build templates for all the different raid bosses: Try swapping that by hand for a while and then come back and tell me what's better.
---
It's not too much grind. It's that this grind is brainless job. Really they had to make something like 'you can craft one of these per day' so that people can't do it too fast? That's like uber stupid.
---
Challenge is when something is hard, but you can see the progress you make. Not when you can't do anything because you're vs someone who's done this for last 5 years. That's like playing basketball match vs nba team, you didn't even touch the ball and someone asks you "how this is not fun?".
---
I said people make this unfun. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DICKS! You do one thing wrong and they start calling you names.
---
You win? 'fuck you lucker'
---
You lose? 'gg ez like ur mom'
---
And yes, that was in GW2.
---
Oh yes im aware, i keep trying to get better with kiting on renegade, like i said i was a total noob on revenant overall never used the class.
---
I still need to learn the rotations, is kind of Hard tbh, but its a matter of getting used and learning how to fight vs certain classes.
---
I know this on other classes but it feels different on renegade.
---
You could have gone for a better title.
---
Da fuk is even horizontal progression?
---
I wanted to try raids, but it isn't for people who don't play 8h a day.
---
I'd have to disagree on majority..
---
Nah, I prefer my charr to be less humanoid and more beastly.
---
Lol, the only Quiznos within 100 miles of me is inside of security at an airport. I could get to it since I'm in the industry, but anyone else would have to buy a ticket to get to it.
---
Oh, why did I see 9,99 when it's 999? Yeah, that makes sense.
---
Sure. Explain me how you improve in a fight when you get insta tko? Teach me master.
---
Nah. Better is to limit crafting 1 item per day. Why don't we do this to all items?
---
I asked for advice but got same treatment as always. 'If you don't like the game as it is then fuck you'. Gj being part of a problem.
---
?
---
Why you think i'm ignoring it?
---
Or two major problems.
---
I guess you failed to use your brain this time, but keep trying.
---
As very obviously stated, it would be an option
---
You see how people are "different" here? Almost all answers are like "this game is not for you" or "you simply suck, go play something else".
---
Criticism on content and direction = violent attacks apparently.
---
&gt;As far as I understand it, there are technical limitations to that, but Anet said they are working on creating a separate PvP build system. I'll be patient on that one.
---
So you're agreeing there's an objective flaw in it. The reasoning may be "technical limitations" or that "they're working on it"... But the reasoning doesn't change perception of the end product.
---
&gt;On its own, it is better than no build templates
---
No. It really isn't. Not for everyone anyways.
---
As i said regarding the WvW/PvE/PvP switch, i'd literally prefer disabling build templates entirely, if it means getting my automated switch back.
---
That **is** an objective flaw, which has absolutely nothing to do with Arcdps... The game has been made worse for me, despite me not wanting this change in the first place.
---
&gt;It is basically the only comparison that is being made when you criticise the templates (other than bugs).
---
You mean... Aside from the one i'm making here...? I feel like you aren't even reading my points.
---
&gt;For the bugs: I agree, but there's no reason why they should remain unsolved.
---
We're still being charge for the bugs unfortunately, which is scummy... And in regards to Anets history with long running bugs, there's no reason to assume they're going to fix **all** of them by the next patch.
---
\-
---
Essentially, selling an **extremely expensive** product, filled with bugs &amp; half assed functionality... Which some players such as myself would prefer playing WITHOUT even if given the choice... Deserves criticism.
---
The Arcdps comparison **is actually** just salt on the wound, cause it proves a single person made a better product than Anet themselves... Even putting the monetization &amp; free aspect of it aside... The whole functionality was simply superior... But that's by no means the basis for my criticism, it's a bonus point.
---
Nobody got banned for using arcdps though, perhaps other mods like bgdm but definitely not arc.
---
[Mist Stranger Outfit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mist_Stranger_Outfit)?
---
WP is really in the wrong here .. while he is stating his personal view and not really reviewing the whole situation, the fact he is okay with triple character bound monetization is bullocks to me.
---
I've commented on build templates before, and was a supporter of having them monetized. In fact, I came pretty close in terms of predictions to what the final product would be (I suspected they would do equipment and build separately and there would be paid slots for each). However, I defended account wide slots, even if they were more expensive.
---
The fact this system is also very limited and doesn't respond necessarily to players needs is a big downer as well. Surprised to see WP thinks this is no big deal and you can just "quickly change some traits if you know your way around". Well no shit we could do that before too.
---
Yikes! How deep will this partnership go? Will we have dead rats singing, playing guitar, and trying to sell us new gem-store items? Srsly, the Spongmonkeys thing permanently turned me off from ever eating Quiznos again. The mere mention of Quiznos conjures images of dead rat puppets that still haunt my dreams... just no. Time to go back to therapy D;
---
Most of the things that i would like to say has been already said. I just wanna add that you can buy asc trinkets from guild vendor as well, for guild commendations (currency that you get doing guild missions) that is quite easy to obtain.
---
Any link to this build? Is it still viable?
---
its based on the necro power, thats also why in golem testing area the buff is useless because there's no source for scaling
---
Is there a link to this build??
---
Plenty of time for trashtalking my team when i'm the one who's perma dead.
---
The creator of arc specifically worked with devs to ensure he never crossed any bannable lines. Just saying. He even included a kill switch for the build template feature for when anet released their own.
---
Sounds quite bad, but it's not pyramid scheme. (disclaimer : I only read your comment, not the news you're linking, tell me if I have to do it to see the pyramid)
---
And my paddle!
---
Exactly this is the reason why i never use a addon.
---
yep, also raid currency can be used to purchase ascended gear at a fraction of the crafting costs, should rng not be on your side
---
in a way fractal tokens too, but last time i checked that method wasn't as worth..so always practice due dilligence!
---
and don't forget about living story maps season 3 and to a lesser extent 4, for easy trinkets on your alts! bitterfrost frontier is a popular one, especially with[ this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Harvesting_Sickle_of_Bounty)
---
The story = the main reason i keep playing.
---
They don't care.  Don't bother.
---
Necro condi scourge is like that. CDs are not synchronized, so you end up having a bunch of 1-3 skills mini rotations and you dash as many of those as you can with a priority. Look on snowcrows.
---
who is that fat big naked lady?
---
Purchasing/shopping addiction is quite common. Game devs know this. Microtransactions use every trick casinos have learned over centuries, plus more.
---
Didn't you say you don't like playing with people and want to play solo instead? Anyway, if you're not finding the game fun anymore it might be time to move on instead of forcing yourself to play.
---
&gt; Instead of pointing that out he just said "I don't mind - manually- swaping gear and traits around"
---
Which defies the entire purpose of what the system was intended for.
---
It is basically all the builds. Especially in fractals where you have a lot of normal mobs and bosses aren't as long encounters as elsewhere. 
---
However, the thing with memorization is, that you still have to memorize which skills are strong, which skills are for CC, which skills can save your party, and so on. Then just use them based on situation and you will never be in wrong.
---
People who just use their dps rotation and don't care about what is happening, are the biggest cause of wipes. It is maybe good strategy if you want to rng through it and just keep trying until one perfect run, but it is always better to save the partymates and continue fight 5 seconds slower than restart. BUT when the situation allows, you want to rotate your strong dps skills in effective way. In raids, people usually have party compositions that allow this window to be as big as possible (for example healing through mechanics so dps guys can ignore it all and never learn how to dodge xD)
---
And we have to deal with the most disgusting system Anet ever created just to add triple monetization. Of course they wont scrap anything. Dont hope for any change. They will probably give 1 loadout or 1 equipment template for free alongside a HUGE "FUCK YOU, GIMME ME MONEYZ" and they call it a day.
---
Why are you suggesting a meme build which will get kicked in most runs?
---
Isn't ascended gear like nothing better than exotic? Or like 1% better?
---
I was told by number of people that if i don't know how to raid then no one will raid with me (wtf is this mindset?).
---
No. I didn't say that.
---
I don't think they will change a thing. Making it like D3 would mean a full redesign and would be too much work. Anet knew what they where doing. The pushed it out regardless. I saw someone point out a while back "well it's out and people already paid for it so we can't make it free now" as an excuse. Just think about it.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what your point is. Just about every raider with 16 builds has quit game. They won‚Äôt manually swap. It‚Äôs not just a couple pieces of gear either. Part of the fun is min maxing for each encounter.

It's the ask for forgiveness not permission strategy. The system is out there, they've made lots of sales, they can't meaningfully change anything now - it's too late. That's all intentional. They deliberately made design choices with monetisation in mind and they released it this way because you can't put the genie back in the bottle.
---
Now they will address the concerns the same way they addressed mount skin loot boxes (aka the system stays). Part of the reason I was so disappointed once I experienced how bad the system was is because I knew there was no chance it would be changed now that it's live. They had a chance before it came out, but they knowingly chose to ignore the feedback and release it anyway.
---
Go to 6:05. Spoiler: 40 seconds of opinion about not caring templates actually being loadouts, not caring about limitation and monetization because he has 40 characters and big gold.
---
Because I play Necro and don't raid yet ? Ie didn't know that.
---
 You can add information without being a douche about it
---
Then I misunderstood your post, my bad (can't double check cause it seems deleted?)
---
yeah, i learnt my lesson...
---
i REALLY wanted to like these, i even defended them here for a bit you know?
---
I just thought with 2 years of development + the high cost they would actually be good, you know?
---
If you are doing any of those even by themselves and you aren't making gold, then there is something else at play. I understand it's expensive, but it is definitely not outrageous like everyone is screaming to the heavens.
---
It‚Äôs 2% better. Trinkets give the most overall. If you read about your class on Snowcrows, practice your rotations on the golem a bit, most training raid groups would take you. Between Raid Academy on Discord and guilds with training raids, you can find a group. It‚Äôs just in LFG you won‚Äôt find anyone to raid with.
---
I know... It's a shame. 2 years of development and all they did for builds was to take already existing pvp and wvw loadouts and put them into the hero pannel.
---
I went to BL Store and looked at my histories, over 7 years I've bought both HOT and POF + 100 worth of blue gems which I spent on skins, 2 bag slots, and all three unlimited farming/gathering tools.
---
I would like to add that there was NO external pressure pushing this feature when they did. We kinda knew they were working on it, but was no one looking at this and ask if players want it in the current state?
---
After the initial presentation and the feedback there would be very little backlash to push it back in the oven for a few months.
---
Arena Net... Stop doing this sh** and just pay some money to big streamer and bring him to gw2...
---
Game companies can be pretty out of touch. Remember when THQ Nordic did an Ama on 8chan a while back?
---
Also Loadouts fuck with your legendarys. It‚Äôs a total shit show.
---
You forgot that removing a legendary weapon for precasting/ skipping removes all upgrades when it is used in another loadout. So we‚Äôd essentially need a number of identical templates with just different weapons, or alternatively weapon templates.
---
Except for a few bugs, ANet's system works actually pretty good. There are some definite fixes that need to go out, especially in dealing with legendary gear, and upgrade components. But I have used it since the day it came out and I've had like... almost no problems with it at all. Having to manually make sure I swap my build in the hero panel when I go into pvp for dailies took some getting used to, and I am hopeful they are still working on the pvp templates. But now swapping to my pvp build is as simple as remembering to put on the right weapons, as those also change for my class.
---
The monetization is a different talk all together, but I have said it in may threads before that I think it's a smart move to monetize it. I think that account upgrades are what ANet SHOULD sell us, and I wish there were more things like this to buy instead of RNG bullcrap that I don't like at all. Not to mention, if I want to I could buy a template once a week just doing the basic daily stuff I do in about 2.5 hour's a day play time.
---
I have the tree flashing problem constantly. I just kind of assumed that‚Äôs how it was. If anyone has a solution I‚Äôd love to hear it.
---
/r/iamverysmart /r/humblebrag
---
well, I was checking the Gw2 official support area(the forums that use your game login and has posts by dev's) and there's a thread with info on it, but I click on the link and it gives me a "No Permission" error.  I think the Mac Client has never been "Great" and it's always ran better if I bootcamp/download the windows Client, but now this might be a Catalina issue.
---
Every class in fractals has its rotation. Due to the short length in fights/mobs, etc you are requiered to reset your rotation all the time or start your rotation mid way. In other words you can say every class in fractals tends to go into a more priority skill roration than an actual rotation.
---
I'm just saying that it was broken as hell at launch of D3 Armory. Hell it was on their PTR for awhile before it was put into the game and we talked about all of the bugs and the destroying of gear, and how it wouldn't work in certain instances, etc.  They did nothing to fix it between then and launch. It also took D3 almost 7 years to give us templates too. It was not always in the game. We got it in 2017.
---
Does ANets Templates need a save option? Yeah I think that'd be a nice upgrade, but honestly they should just rename the system to Build Loadouts since that's what they are.
---
I knew of at least a few in my area; just went and looked them up and lo and behold they're all dead.
---
I got 10k gems for this crap (spent 3.3).
---
Why? Because the game is fucking unplayable without templates.
---
For me it was only worth it on sale, and only for WvW where participation and rewards keep ticking whether you lose or win.
---
Hopefully they'll eventually introduce WvW seasons and improve rewards when winning, and make it even more useful.
---
It was more like... It's hard to explain, both because I most probably don't know the correct words, and also because it's a bit naive, but personally I think that spending any gold/cash on templates the way they are right now, is basically going against the general good of the community. Ofc, the game has to earn money somehow, and ofc, we had similar situations with bundles or mount packs. 
---
But here, I see buying those as greenlighting anet to push for more untested and broken features, after all people are buying those.
---
Except the wvw department, which doesn't actually exist
---
I mean, it's still better than WoW.  This is something that can be fixed pretty easily.  Just tell your friend to create a character specific for PvP and that'll solve some problems.  Then that character gets more builds and loadouts from the start instead of having one per mode like we had before.
---
"Rotations" are often misunderstood by players. Following a rotation strictly is for a 'best case scenario' and against a passive enemy that won't interrupt you, but in practice it's always priority system as boss mechanics force you to change what you do at any given time.
---
As long as you are using your skills in an order that will laid the ones that give party damage buffs first, followed by the ones that hit the hardest, you should keep a constant decent damage.
---
Anet marketing always pulls out some interesting stuff
---
I had that belief for the last 5 years.
---
Until recently, the comparison between the two games are just so clear...
---
And also nothing political, I‚Äôm from mainland China so that also counts as a reason.
---
Am I the only one that actually liked Quiznos sandwiches? Shame that they are a scam.
---
It's not Arenanet anymore. So stop supporting Ncsoft.
---
It is whining lmao. A bunch of children crying to each other without any understanding of the industry.
---
I got one on my second account. It's useful enough if you need the exp booster for all its ... boosts.
---
No matter how good Arc templates were, no matter how well it worked and no matter how nice it was compared to official build templates, the truth is Arc templates still were an unofficial .dll addon made by some random person (not Anet employee), negating all the good what Arc templates were.
---
It is like someone builds a dream house, lives there year or two and then government comes and says it must be demolished because there was no official build permit and government wants to build an outhouse there. No matter how nice the house is.
---
I‚Äôve found it! The rarest comment on reddit....
---
Life steal is a hybrid effect between support and damage:
---
* Damage done scales with power.
---
* Healing done scales with healing power.
---
* When it's done with an effect like Vampiric Aura, the stats used are the ones of the player giving the aura.
---
* When it's done with combos on dark aura, the stats used are those of the one providing the finisher. This also applies to other combos, the stats used are always from the player doing the finisher. 
---
* It has its own unique type of "lifesteal" damage that is calculated a bit differently than normal damage. Map and creature artists making PvE content often forget this, and because of that many enemies and objects immune to physical, fire, ice, lightning and chocking damage can still be damaged by lifesteal. Like Taitha's Gate.
---
The scaling is so tiny it isn't going to make a huge difference
---
I do mind paying for build templates. A system as fundamental to that should be included with the base game.
---
Keeping the game alive should be the domain of cosmetics. It's not an either or. The defence of every and any monetisation decision can't always be "they need to keep the game alive somewhow" - it's dishonest. There are good and bad ways to monetise the game.
---
I played scepter greatsword dh on the first day by mistake, somehow still won
---
The existing stuff on the wiki already covers one at a time very well.
---
Did you look at Spellbreaker healing and evades with Might Makes Right? Did you look at Weaver barrier per second and evades? Did you take into account Mirage evade and distortion uptimes allowing players to eliminate damage?
---
Sustain doesnt just equal healing buddy. It's your ability to **sustain a fight** through all defensive utility. Fire Weaver has comparable sustain because it has evades, barrier on dodge, evades on its weapon skills.
---
You can't just compare healing values because it doesn't describe the full picture. Healing is not everything. Endurance Regen, Invulns, blocks, barrier *and healing* all are part of sustain. 
---
Your maths is pointless, because it doesn't take into account any of this stuff.
---
How can somebody sleep in this position and why she prefers the floor instead of the chair or smth else.
---
I'm so confused xD
---
Unless you have gems and shared inventory slots to spare, do not waste gems on that.
---
Focus on account-wide account upgrades first instead:
---
* Bank slots
---
* Shared inventory slots
---
* Material storage expansions.
---
* Character slots. 
---
* Everlasting kits and gathering tools if you have shared inventory slots to keep them. 
---
Etc.
---
OOTL, whahappened this time?
---
Eat those upgrades you fat bitch, you know you love it.
---
You were expressing that sentiment.
---
Switching from third person to first person for exaggeration when a quote is clearly made up should not be that difficult to comprehend...
---
Stop making sense! This isn't the place for that.
---
Not to mention Starcraft 2, Heroes of the Storm, the problems with Diablo 3 on release, the lacklustre reception of recent WoW expansions... Blizz ain't what they used to be.
---
Works great in WvW to level up your rank.  Also makes it feel like you're somewhat getting rewards too.
---
If you really need it for XP boosts in PvE though, its pretty solid as well.  Leveling isn't that hard though and you get plenty of boosts along the way.  I only use mine for WvW at this point though.
---
Agreed, it was a feature that people wanted for a very long time, and anet only decided to do it when money got involved. Pretty sad overall.
---
lol, it's like if they had a promo at Blockbuster in 2019 or something.  
---
"Hey guys, go rent a VHS tape and get a free 2 headed dragon mount!  Wheeeeeeeee!"
---
Fair points
---
:)
---
&gt; Like what part of ‚Äúat your own risk‚Äù do you guys not understand? Then you come here and cry when you get banned.
---
There's no risk though. Or well, there's the "risk" that you have time to actually play better-developed games where the developers don't implement features **or at least the API for players to do it themselves** for absolutely no reason because games before theirs showed what an important element it is.
---
So here we are, **years later**, and I'm happily swapping out my templates and classes and **even whole glamour sets** in FF14. And make no mistake I wasn't banned in GW2, the game just forced me out by being so much wasted potential since release, so much that could have been done if done on a proper budget instead of wanting only to be a vessel for mtx.
---
The system already exist, Look at the build storage. It literally saves and loads builds on the fly it just needs to be applied to the actual build loadouts. 
---
 I'm not saying that its an overnight fix but it could be done.
---
Duel class will never happen in gw2. It would break the game and be impossible to balance.
---
Also, I'm not even sure how they could implement it.
---
Is anyone in, or know of, an NA guild where the demographics skew a bit older? My guildies are nice but avg age is probably 18 and we don't have a lot in common (18 was a long time ago). Posted in r/guildrecruitment but no response so I thought I'd check here as it get's more traffic.
---
Yeah, except that the two things they handle are vastly different and works quite differently.
---
He wasn‚Äôt being a piece of shit. Had he kept on going after op explained, then he would‚Äôve been a piece of shit.
---
The way the game is now with all the nerfs on builds that are popular why not break the game and start a next chapter fresh like they did when adding mounts.
---
Also there's FF14. Where one character swaps classes like builds, whole gearsets get swapped with a single button from a separate per-slot-sorted inventory just for items, you can create gearsets however you want go ahead do shit and you can **swap glamours as whole templates**.
---
I didn't know I needed templates, but playing FF14 for a year now I can't imagine playing a game without them. &gt;.&gt;
---
They have technically already played around with it a bit though.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/WvW_Core_Swap
---
As I have stated in the opening post, all guardians have precasted Ashes of the Just, which is a firebrand skill. Due to how this skill works the whole damage is done by the first person that casts it and that was me in our kill. It also takes the stats of the person that casts it first, which is why I was on Condition Firebrand.
---
Oh they do exist, they just got tasked with more important things, like making gemstore skins.
---
You do you, but i don't think highly of people that spam in caps in private chat
---
Makes sense, I was unaware of this. Kudos for the enlightenment.
---
In the same boat, doubt there‚Äôs any chance I‚Äôll get that mini, unless I happen to get one from a giveaway or something.
---
They are on par with most modern cosmetics price wise - only big complain I remember was when they released first batch without the select license. And my personal salt is that they are not available through statuettes like literally any other blc cosmetic. 
---
All in all mount skins are literally best way to make money in f2p model - single non unique skin can be bought for 400-500g and is both visually pleasing, widely recognizable  and non intrusive (excluding full permafrost fuckcers on shining models)
---
If you like a challenge, try soloing champion enemies you find in the world (there are various ones scattered around maps). It's not easy, and you may have to shift your build a few times to pull it off, but it is absolutely doable with practice and it's a great learning tool!
---
i'm out of the loop. what is this?
---
Looks great, definitely waiting for the full version!
---
The statuette offerings aren't very spectacular lately.  A LOT of minis.
---
Sunk cost fallacy, same problem with an old beater car that you put money into to repair.
---
to be fair, you are not missing much isnt this bundle just a few booster and really small bags? Ii think its aimed at the newer players
---
More like you not understanding what the main points of criticism on build templates are.
---
Gw2  "templates"
---
The patch that makes you feel you're f2p....
---
OORAH
---
You alright hun?
---
Like, I am a financially comfortable player who buy gems without caring too much.  I used arcdps templates all the time and I bought the new ones for my fav character since I just wanna play the game.  Sure, I could protest and spend all my time manually switching gear.. I was switching gear during the gap period and it SUCKED.  So no.  I run a raiding guild and we raid all the time.  I just want to play so I gave them $40 and moved on.  I doubt they'll change their policy on this and it is just gw2 now.  My option was pay or quit
---
I‚Äôm in NYC, the closest Quiznos is 49 miles away.  There are over 40 permanently closed in the city. 
---
This is a stupid promo.
---
178k burn tick fml
---
I mean, I had 10k gems bought with gold post release after i logged in 2 years ago - still I rage in silence when i am reminded that bought additional crafting license. CRAFTING LICENSE. I imagine I would feel the same now if i bought the notepad+ (build storage).
---
Ok, kids. Move away from it and back into the house slowly. 
---
Slowly...
---
does it even matter? you guys always come with something new around the corner when someone dares to not agree with you.
---
Well it seems they took action against a non-scammer this time. Their CS is really fucked, tbh.
---
$100 and this feature is yours!
---
You really ask me if valid criticism on a feature and you being unable to understand it matters? "We" don't even need to come around the corner with something "new" if you're still stuck failing to understand the "old" stuff.
---
Second this opinion. I have the booster going 100% of the time in WvW and it‚Äôs totally worth it, even after they removed the combat boosts. The reward tracks only take about 5 1/2 hours with this and the birthday boosters.
---
Ends up reddit is a vocal minority like always.
---
Idk man, I‚Äôve agreed previous but seeing recent wow releases actually gainin features, decent content, reinvigorations of old system, new races, etc. All of which are things *this* community has been asking for for years? My defense of GW2 is getting weaker...
---
Yes. I hate being forced to grind for unreasonable ammounts of time. I'll do it fine on my own time, but this really pushed my buttons the wrong way. I'm not saying anyone else should. I did hope to provide feedback on why it made -me- give up. 6 months later though... Yea, I did just come back to the game after RL took me away for quite a bit.
---
Sorry to hear that. It must feel horrible. I love the game and it is going through some turbulent times that I hope Anet can get through. 
---
I have read of many cases like yours where Anet  deletes a post and there doesn't seem to be a reason other than they didn't like it. That's why I stay away from there.
---
Hope at some point the situation improves to the point you will consider coming back.
---
No? It's just funny to me that you pretend to not have broken any rules, yet it seems you have never read them either.
---
Not trying to excuse the official forum moderation, but I think I have an explanation.
---
They probably don't want anything on the forums that could inspire people to leave the game (or not try it in the first place). Given their pattern of removing posts with even a hint of negativity, no matter how constructive the accompanying feedback is, it seems like they just want to sanitize the hell out of the one platform they can control in an attempt to make the game look better. I dunno. Don't take it personally, it happens to tons of people.
---
That's the thing though. Noone forced me to grind legendaries. And in 7 years, I never did. I didn't feel punished for it. This is quite different though. I'm not the kind of person that could simply skip a mount as I skipped all the legendaries before.
---
Just watch a few of his streams videos (twitch/yt) and you'll know he is big narcissist asshole. He is always right and he dismiss all other opinions lol
---
I spent so much time waiting for WvW poi‚Äôs to open up. Lol
---
Not worth it. The cooldown and transforms just make it hard to use.
---
no thank you
---
I‚Äôve even noticed that I spent more than I should over time on this game. It‚Äôs why I limited myself to only buying when I have the ingame gold to afford it anymore.
---
It the final answer,  since the monday after the first weekend, there were an official statement explaining the ban.
---
I think it might be a good idea for you to look into buying an MMO mouse or something alike instead of going this route.
---
There are SO MANY ways to get the 250 currencies. Reward tracks, hearts, nodes, doing events in season 4 maps, [Traveling Elonian Trader](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Traveling_Elonian_Trader#Curious_Stones_from_Afar). You could have parked one character next to the npc, trade voltaic magic for 5 currencies per day and after 50 days tops you would have gotten a stack of each. But propably you don't have voltaic magic either. Dragonfall makes it very easy to get the 6th currency. Play the game. People were asking for a reason to go back to old maps, the skyscale is that reason. There are propably some guides on how to do it most efficiently. For the Istan currency it is the easiest to do the heart at the Astralarium with all characters.
---
Is this a Skritt on cocaine?
---
Look, try to not be a jerk for one moment and listen to what I'm trying to say.   
---
I didn't post the thing to stir up drama. The whole point of it was to explain how this exact grind was too much for me and that even if I loved the game for 7 years, it drove me away. It was posted there so that perhaps not more of similar events take place.   
---
And when you have a rule about drama and can simply be used to delete the post and hide it from everyone's eyes... How could I have possibly bring my message across without breaking that rule? I was very methodical and as polite as possible with it.
---
I agree with the concept (don't want anything on the forums that could inspire people to leave the game etc.) but there are many ways they could do that without deleting the posts. Trying to make the game look better given some of the situations I've seen is like trying to make a pig look better by putting some lipstick on it.
---
One approach they could take is to respond to the "goodbye" posts which I have seen other games do. Something like: "Sorry to see you leave, it was not our intention to make players feel . . ." They don't have to admit or explain anything other than regret a player has left the game. That's how I would approach it.
---
But what your asking would be a spoon feed game. Even for me skywing is still spoon feed. You can buy an item to skip some JP so that's money brute force. And about the food and some time gated material, you can literally buy all of them in TP, as for the grind on 250 currency. It takes you around 2-3hrs to grind them with around 5-8 characters if you are rushing. If you do daily it would take you a week maybe.
---
Your mindset for me is like. The skywing should just be in the gemstore where I can easily get it. It's already easy and honestly the scavenger hunt was fun. I won't creticize you on how you play the game but it looks like you want everything to be easy and accessible by everyone. That would make the game boring when everything is so easy to get.
---
I dont understand why people have a problem with rotations. What you describe liking about that rev build is the case for all builds. A rotation is just the optimal way order your skills to get the most possible dps when hitting a golem. Once you start fighting anything other than a golem that rotation just serves as a reference point. Skill priority is something everyone benefits from learning about their builds. Knowing what your skills do and how to best use them in various encounters and build options is part of playing any class/build in gw2.
---
I was not aware that this is a common occurance. That seems very scummy indeed. :/
---
Season 4 opened with a raid and fractal with episode 1 so its not like they have never done it before.
---
Doesn't game kick out after 5 min afk?
---
I said that in online gaming people are what makes it not fun. I'm not good player and i get crazy angry when i get impossible challenge and then lose and enemy is just like 'gg ez'. And i'm like "the fuck i'm even supposed to learn from this instadeath?".
---
Ok so templates are now officially a thing. From what I can gather so far, it essentially allows you to swap around different "hero kits" right? Like a certain template you could have certain gear and a certain weapon type whereas another build it could focus on different stats and a different weapon type. If that's the case, given you unlock all templates and have different weapon combinations, could you functionally have access to literally all of your abilities as core Elementalist (granted to access different sets you need to change outside of combat)?
---
*(Holy shit my dream of quickly accessing all 10000+ elementalist abilities is coming to life)*
---
I totally agree that it could be handled better. Unfortunately there's nothing we can do about it, so this subreddit would be the more appropriate place to post such messages...even if they always get downvoted, at least the mods don't delete them.
---
GREETINGS MY FELLOW ROBOT HOW YOUR COMPUTING IS TODAY
---
Well, at least there's plenty of Waffle Houses around.
---
That's the point I was trying to bring across. I never really felt penalized for not going through the legendary grind. There were people that did, and I could sort of silently admire their dedication for it without having to go through it. The mount though feels like such an integral part of the whole account and not the character alone that I simply couldn't treat it the same way. It was such a big issue to me personally that I couldn't get past it. That was the only thing I wanted to convey. That this could in fact actually chase away dedicated players. Of course it's a personal judgement.
---
It was partially my fault, i should have stated that i'm referring to the subreddit rules, not the forum rules. Sorry for that.
---
I see no constructive criticism anywhere in your post. You whine about an optional grind, and a forum post that was rightfully removed, then get hyper defensive. You‚Äôre not handling this appropriately, and appear to be purposefully making a scene.
---
Stop right there you criminal scum! Stop! You violated the law! Why! Won't! You! Die!
---
I think you can setup an auto mouse app that could move a bit which would make the game think the user is not afk
---
Since other already guided you on the how to I'll just add some notes that may help you.
---
Your first ascended armor is the hardest to get, but it's also the most important. Choosing the right weight for the right profession is key here.
---
Since your goal is fractals, I would not suggest going for a diviner set for support chronomancer, it's harder to obtain via crafting and support chrono is not as viable in fractals as it used to be.
---
For a first ascended armor set I would suggest a DPS role to start with (you mentioned thief, could be a valid option, a power Daredevil is a very solid dps). This role will fit into any fractal team, which is return will reward you with gold and other ascended gear. Once you start dropping other sets I would go for the other roles (could be your diviner Chrono, a healer, whatever you feel like playing/gearing).
---
I guess my point is, gearing a Dps first is a safer bet than gearing a support that's not as meta as it used to be, while also being easier.
---
Edit: Forgot to mention that some trinkets can hold multiple infusion slots for AR. Rings for example can be upgraded to 3 slots each, which can be very good to get some base agony resistance early one for t2 or even t3 fractals.
---
Happy cake day
---
Then you could leave it how it is on your charr.
---
Bioware is far from innocent but EA has forced some regulations on its games, even bioware games, that has harmed game development. Like forcing the use if the Frostbite engine and microtransactions. Which has no doubt had an inverse effect on recent Bioware games (as has the failing upper management and "Bioware magic" belief).
---
Not about easy or not. If you want it to feel like an achievement, put it behind something skillful, not an arbitrary ammount of meaningless, mindnumbing tasks. It's not an achievement. It's just time gating and boring. And if it were for cosmetics, fine. For legendaries, fine, I'd not care. But the mounts here seem like such an integral part of the game it'd be like sticking your improved glider duration in HoT behind a massive runabout grind that this mount has. It's not even a question about easy or hard in fact. There's nothing actually hard about the grind for the mount. It's just mindnumbing boring farm that takes so very long.
---
why is he shouting
---
That's not the case anymore, ever since Rytlock became a magic user, the Olmakhan were discovered, and the Flame Legion were reincorporated into Legion life. Magic is something a charr can be proud of now.
---
I saw a similar group in LA in the Priory camp. They chatted while listening to an online radio, for which one of them was a DJ. It was all pretty neat.
---
I usually play on secondary monitor and have no issues, but while travelling with my Mac I get this [https://imgur.com/a/fY9G6sZ](https://imgur.com/a/fY9G6sZ) while playing fullscreen. I thought the problem was solved, but apparently it only works when I disconnect external monitor while running the game and not when I had it disconnected before. Tbh. it doesn't bother me much, because I still can play in windowed mode without problems.
---
Can't relate to this in any way. What were you doing usually ingame?
---
The charr are not that far yet. Just listen to Ephram's daughter.
---
I saw TACH (assuming that's them) defend a camp in orr during some risen event once. Had a nice split with casters/ archers in the back on both sides of the camp, melees in the front and one guy moving around giving orders. Pretty impressive, I've seen them a few more times in the past and their character outfits are always on spot.
---
The branches are merged every night - so why have different branches?  Because each one is configured differently and runs different parts of the game.  In particular, Living World episodes are developed in a pipeline and the most recent LW episode is configured to run without any of the following  (unshipped and partially developed) ones to ensure there isn't some bad dependency on unshipped code or content that would only show up later when it was harder to fix.
---
This is exactly the reason they dont stand up anymore. Plus it's frowned upon to stand up straight because its associated with the oppressive flame legion.
---
While D3 armory is much better than what we got in GW2, it is quite far from being perfect IMHO.
---
You just upgraded your Focus ring, stored in 7 templates across several characters? well, now all these templates are broken, showing nothing in that slot, and you have to update them manually. And even without upgrades, if you share an item between different character, you must not forget to unequip it and put into stash manually before you switch character too - it is still better than GW2 equipment templates (where you also need to equip shared items manually), but I would not call it "works great".
---
That's just rediculous. Low-effort or low value? That's just incorrect. I've put a lot of effort into it. And how much value you personally find in it is just subjective. I think it holds a lot value. Enough value to actually be posted.
---
I'm 99% sure class swapping will never happen.  If every class used the same armor, maybe, but heavy/medium/light just makes it too messy I think.
---
You can get more by doing it again today, yes.  The item you need from the Chak Gerent actually comes from killing the Chak Gerent directly, so it's actually possible to get multiple items from the same meta by helping finish off the Gerent in multiple lanes.
---
Maybe spending a ton of money will make me actually enjoy the game again Pepega
---
I really didn't like the fact I had to dish out the gold, but at least I had the option to make the gold on my terms. When I felt like it, I'd go grind out the chests on that pre-HOT map. When I felt up for it, I'd go farm ores and herbs and such for selling. And so on, anything I really did slowly contributed to that goal.
---
It's absolutely possible to set up keybinds for templates, yes.  Just check the Controls menu in F11 like you would to set up any other keybinds.
---
There is no specific way to always link certain build and gear templates together, though, but you can manufacture your own.  As an example, you can keybind Build Template 1 to NumPad 1, and Gear Template 1 to Ctrl+NumPad 1, then NumPad 2 for Template 2, and so on.  If you want each set to be linked, you'd need to press the NumPad button and then follow up with Ctrl+ the same NumPad button.  That's pretty close to what you're looking for, right?
---
Did you try copying the d3d9.dll to the folder where GW2-64.exe is located?
---
Don't listen to the plebs who insist that condi builds are bad for fractals. 
---
I play a shortbow/shortbow condi soulbeast with the simplest priority rotation imaginable. I used this class to get from T2 to Fractal Master. 
---
In casual PUGs I am basically always among the top two DPS, and often first by a large margin. Especially on boss fights that require a lot of dodging and movement.
---
Yes, that's how criticism works. Understanding the issue.
---
You certainly can, and I'm pretty sure I told you that much in one of the earlier replies in this thread. ;) If you want to be able to swap between Dagger/Dagger and Staff out of combat, use your two gear templates to set up identical sets of equipment, save for one having the daggers equipped and the other having your staff.  Make keybinds for the two templates, and swap them freely at will outside of combat without needing to open your inventory.
---
At higher levels, you can actually pick different stat sets for your gear too, so you can have your healing Tempest set and your condition damage Weaver set and whatnot.  Though, of course, getting more than two sets of gear available in templates requires spending gems, so that's not necessarily ideal...
---
Yes but heavy/medium/light armor is more for just fashion wars essentialy they can all have the same stats.
---
Aye thanks. I supposed it could get it, but never hurts to check it before.
---
Generally I'd see to getting the world completion on the new characters I felt like playing. I'd spend plenty of time in WvW and some in sPvP. I tried to catch up on the story on all the toons. Every so often I'd go run a dungeon or a particular piece of the content for a piece of gear I'd like. Weekly guild runs were also a thing... Don't know, casual playing I guess? Is it just me that's weird? Do people generally enjoy this sorta stuff in gw2 (stuff like this mount's acquisition)? O.o
---
Condition builds are generally frowned upon in fractals because the fights are much shorter. In raids they're 100% fine because there's ample time for condis to ramp up and deal damage, but by the time you hit your damage spike in fractals with conditions the mob is already dead.
---
As a casual pve player, and hardcore roleplayer in GW2 there was a lot about the community I never saw until I came to this subreddit. There is good, and bad in every gaming community, but some of the 'hardcore' players here are the most entitled cunts I've seen. 
---
There really is two completely different views of this game, and community. Some of the comments here are respectful, and some are just indignant, and a prime example of why we can't have nice things.
---
Got the gist of your message despite the typo, that was just an innocent joke at the end.
---
But the fact still remains the goodbye posts are more or less against the ToS of the official forums and historically they all get deleted for said reasons.
---
Regarding the post, I was referencing this one (which has also been subsequently removed). There was no constructive criticism, just whining. For it to become constructive, you would need to supply examples of where it was bad, and how it could be improved. Just saying it‚Äôs too grindy is not constructive until you provide some solutions.  These may have been in your forum post, but we‚Äôre totally absent from Reddit. 
---
So far as making a scene, you were receiving something for it, attention. On being defensive, you‚Äôve called the forum and Reddit moderator‚Äôs actions ‚Äúscummy‚Äù. 
---
Edit: You also called another commenter a jerk, and me mean-spirited.
---
I think OP was saying ANet "management" wants the "game", being gw or gw2, dead, not the fan made video. 
---
Not sure what is meant by management, could refer to a lot of individuals or the may be referencing a specific event.
---
most of it is whining
---
Internet needs to stop with that bulshit, throwing around "its an opinion tho" to justify everything. EA also thinks lootboxes are fun and harmless .. should we just accept that too because its their opinion?
---
Build templates are, factually, bad. Its a fact, not an opinion. Its a fact they went with a very aggressive monetization scheme with a product thats severely limited and its not even better to what we had before. Its a fact, not an opinion.
---
&gt; you can finish HoT to get a choice of ascended weapon for basically **free**
---
not with the prices mystic weapons have
---
he has 40 characters, that stuff doesn't matter to him
---
Wow... that sounds like the problem I have playing games in general... takes something far more fun to pull me away after having spent such time and money into it.
---
Won't happen. It's a separate and incomplete animation set. Just use the Olmakhan Sand Effigy combat tonic and you'd see. If you equip bows, bam you're now using core tengu animations. When you have any other weapon it's close to typical charr animations.
---
The Flame Legion shamans only have a unique animation for weaponless stance and simply do noy use the four legged running at all.
---
Ignoring the fact that making default animation sets is non-existent and possibly a hard coded switch in thr spaghetti code of GW1's engine, they'd have to create a dozen new animation sets as well as the ability yo swap animations.
---
Far easier for them to just give us combat tonics with the incomplete animation set, which they have already given us two of.
---
You guys still raid?
---
He has 40 characters, this doesn't apply to him
---
when you are wrong you are wrong.
---
sounds a lot like reddit
---
You are correct. The shamans alter their natural posture so as to stand above and show off dominance to the other charr.
---
We even see this in GW1 where only shamans stand upright.
---
To his defense, I still think he is independent. He just sometimes happens to have some weird views on things. He also shows to base a lot of his opinions on personal experience. For instance his stance on masteries being character bound because he likes to replay the xp grind or whatever.
---
Ah, I remember those days. I did my first two world completions while WvW was still required for it, and it sucked, but I needed those gifts.
---
you shoud go for rev,easiest to play,no1 rly expect anything from you and if you manage to press 1 button and autoattack you are ok for most T4 groups.
---
Sounds to me like he is very confused haha. Maybe he commented on the wrong thread
---
For me I have a problem sticking with games that don't have some sort of progression. If I don't feel like I've accomplished something I can't play it for long.
---
I hope someone comes along to revive her soon.. she's got a GW2 Toaster to loot!
---
After this video he definitely should be in terms of content creation and opinion blogging
---
Personally I don't think it is. I'm hoping it's just some random creature that's trying to eat us because we're in the Far Shiverpeaks and there must be dangerous creatures in this world that aren't creations of the Elder Dragons.
---
i fly a lot. ive tried playing with d912pxy/radial/arcdps/reshade combo, plays great and stable, but i just cant play with fog so i uninstalled all that and went back to hook/radial/arcdps combo
---
With GW2 specifically it is recommended (required for me) to put reshade in the bin(64) folder (the .dll, the .ini plus the shader and template folder).
---
It didn't work for me with the files in the game folder (next to the .exe).
---
Also, what is d3d9_chainload.dll in your case? The radial mount addon? And shouldn't "ReShade64.dll" be "dxgi.dll" instead if using d912xy? "d3d12.dll" should work too.
---
I only know of the scenarios where d912xy is involved in the chain.
---
Also, gw2hook specifically does not work with d912xy I think, but I don't know if you were trying to do that or not. ReShade is fine.
---
Edit: Also, using 4.4 Reshade (out as of today) earlier didn't work for me (crash), so I reverted back to 4.3 - might be unrelated though.
---
Yes I said and I say it again. He dissed it as internet whining when all reddit did was saying how the system could be better and improved. Not sure what the point of your comment was.
---
I'll be playing mostly fractals and open world so i guess i will create one now thanks
---
Thanks
---
One very big one
---
I have added a few links to the comment that might be useful :)
---
Yeah, game hasn't changed. Only thing that's changed, is how you feel about it. 
---
Raids are a different ball game, and i agree with your point, i found a group i join twice a week and we have a shit ton of fun clearing raids, to the point that i never look at LFG anymore, but i know Raid LFG is dead in NA.
---
I see this argument frequently: no sub fee so one should pay to support the game. 
---
This may be true, but your money spent indicates you support what was sold as worth the value. The feedback this gives to the vendor is: this is good, make more of this.
---
I would counter this argument to say: buy what you want to see more of, and don‚Äôt buy what you want to see less.
---
Thanks a lot m8
---
They may have changed how they handle it, but you used to be able to get people banned by having RMT sellers send gold directly to your victim.
---
And to head off the people who say, "just don't accept stuff from randos ecks dee":
---
You don't/didn't need to be friends with the person.
---
You don't/didn't need to ever talk to the person.
---
You don't/didn't need to accept the mail.
---
You don't/didn't need to open the game.
---
All they had to do is have an RMT send you the gold.
---
All that needed to happen is for RMT gold to land in your inbox, *regardless of whether or not you accept it*.
---
The person getting you banned would get away for it because the gold never touched their hands and there's no trail connecting them to it, meanwhile you get banned for something you didn't do.
---
Quite honestly I'm surprised that afaik there haven't been any assholes who've gone and visited lion's arch or HoT meta events, written down everyone's account info and character name, and then had small amounts of gold sent to everyone.  They may have changed how they handle this kind of thing though.
---
UI functionality and quality of life. Encouraged by filling the new UI with large ‚Äúlocked‚Äù symbols to try and bait people to buy so they don‚Äôt miss out.
---
I mean most EU holos agree with me about damage output being more of an issue than Healing. Also Spellbreakers endurance regen is far far higher than Holo's, almost double.
---
Again you completely ignored the issue of comparing healing when evades, invulns, blocks, etc. all exist too. Sustain isn't just healing.
---
Well yeah, that's true. I still love mechanics of this game, but i still hate that most things in game rewards you with crap to salvage.
---
Not even once in game i got reward and was like "wow that's super awesome".
---
the reason he doesnt recognise the faults is becaus ehe hasnt relaly looked into the system yet.
---
Isn't this is scummy shit that all fast food companies have done since McDonald's?
---
Skeleton
---
Looks nice. It has a vibe of something that could be called "this ain't guild wars". Would watch though :)
---
So perfect for a kind of new player ;) can't be worse than condi thief
---
Not really. Even considering that this subreddit likes to complain it's a pretty stupid move to pick one of the most valid concerns (which of course is gonna turn more "hostile" if a publisher asks for feedback just to completely ignore it) as an example for the subreddit complaining too much in his opinion. Either evaluate your point of view on a questionable complaint with proper arguments or deal with people questioning your mental capabilities if you can't even remember the complaints that were all over the subreddit for a few days.
---
&gt; Everything about build storage was under the header "Build Template Sharing", and focused on dealing with builds of professions other than your current one.
---
Ehh... no.
---
Love this! I'm one of the insane people who decided to unlock all the collections one day, and am randomly getting stuff done as I go through my GW2 daily adventures. 
---
2 suggestions: 
---
1) Add a secondary "Area" Column, so that you can sort my region as well as specific map. That way you can cut down waypointing even more.
---
2) Add a column for if you need to bring specific items to said place, for example Bifrost and Bloodstone Dust. So you don't get there, and then be all sad you can't check that off.
---
Absolutely love this though!
---
They are trying. A lot has been fixed, a lot is still broken.
---
My point exactly...
---
I think this looks cool! 
---
But weren't signets rings? 
---
The 10 slots = 10 fingers thing was something I remember reading about a long long long, long long, time ago.
---
i would assume they fix some bugs and at some time they extend it to 10 loadouts. but thats it imho
---
For any issues with payment you should contact the support.
---
&gt;  participate in subscriptions are the reason big studios mainly put out puke they made after smoking their butthash
---
Wut? You know that the mmorpg genre exploded and became mainstream because of subs games 20 years ago, right? It's nothing new. 
---
&gt; It is really time for the gaming industry to collapse so it can be rebuild
---
Time is passing, everything change. When something is done, it's done. If it ever crash, it will never reborn as you would want anyway if it even does.
---
Mobile gaming is still printing money. Console games is still making money. Every micro transactions games... are still making money. No nothing will collapse soon. It won't collapse just because a bunch of peeps disagree with it.
---
Again, as we mainly witness currently on this sub, if you don't like it,  don't puke over those who like it, it won't change a thing and you will alienate people with different point of view since all of you are not only disrespecting other point of view (which could be tolerable), but you're all trying to forbid it.
---
Ah so your problem with the skyscale was that you couldn't choose which content to play to make progress? That makes sense.
---
Diviner ascended gear is time gated. Exotics can be bought of tp.
---
I‚Äôve had one since they released it. It‚Äôs pretty great for the cheap boosters.   Keep a couple stacks in your inventory, spam click or auto click.   
---
Great for World boss train downtime (like fire elemental or Megadestroyer).  
---
Exp, MF, Karma, Wxp.   Plus the Exp boost has the kill streak booster tied into it. 
---
Only what, 300gems?  If you‚Äôre farming at all, it‚Äôs a great asset to have.
---
&gt; It would mean that more of the people who want the item would have it. That is an objectively better outcome, no "compelling argument" is needed. 
---
LOL you can't declare something to be objectively better by fiat. From my perspective, it would be worse if everyone who wanted one had one. So yeah, not so objective.
---
This is basically inting.   If they hit it out of bounds you can let it hit the ground and then that's your point.  This dude is just wasting energy... Just like real spvp
---
I didn't have a specific spot but my map reward for the last map on I did on second completion was a precursor, so that was nice
---
Like an above poster said, some has been fixed, some is still broken. Personally while it's anecdotal I was playing in NA open-world PvE and halloween stuff all yesterday and didn't see any large crashes or issues, maybe a bit more lag in some areas than average but I can't definitively pin it to templates.
---
As for the system design itself, Thursday or Friday Anet left a brief message on the forums acknowledging the rough launch and community response, and said they're doing some meetings and internal conversation on how to move forward. Then the weekend happened. Not sure how long it'll take before they come up with a response but I'd expect some sort of further acknowledgement and maybe a vague game plan within the next work week.
---
I feel like you're missing my point entirely, while revoicing an opinion time and again that I made no comment against.
---
This game is never going to change because of people like you. Shame! Fanboys... Stop playing it and show Arena Net that we need big changes here... Stop supporting them... Decide with your time and wallet.
---
I don't normally post here, but seriously, after the amount of hate anet gets, DDos  attacking that site during their 24hr stream was on a whole new level.
---
That's what you cute people get when you think F2P/B2P games are cheaper than sub games. They always end up being way more expensive and with shit in-game rewards by design to drive up sales in their cash stores.
---
If you care about cosmetics in a game, you'll play the sub based games because they are way less expensive than F2P garbage.
---
sorry, we couldnt find pocket raptors to prestack our sigils :(
---
Thanks.
---
I don't necessarily plan on soloing champions/dungeons, i just liked the idea when people said Necro can do this because i mostly play alone. And i thought maybe he is a bit tougher/easier while leveling. But having him also at 35-40 now it really seems like you said that it's more about skill than the class.
---
I will switch back to Mesmer and practice more. Funny enough she just started with lvl 41 in Fields of Ruin, so i'm looking forward to that "easy" Champion :D
---
Just because its an opinion don't make them free of criticism or valid... There are people with the opinion the world is flat too...   
---
&gt; Opinion is really the lowest form of human knowledge. It requires no accountability, no understanding
---
This isn't remotely true; the game has been letting us use 3 different builds with the PvP and WvW builds for years prior to this release and the whole elite specialisation system means there are at least 3 different ways to play each class.
---
That you've chosen not to doesn't mean that everyone else who does is wrong; that people want basic functionality *that was in the previous game in the series* without having to pay hundreds if dollars for it isn't wierd. 
---
You can add all the snark and (passive) aggression to your post that you want - it doesn't make you right.
---
You are seriously reaching here. Obviously there was 3, WvW and PvP are both separate and count as 1 build when in them. Being angry and entitled doesn‚Äôt make *you* right. 
---
I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm right or not, bottom line if you want more than 2 builds per game mode than pay up, boo hoo.
---
I whale for games because I want to fund continued development. I like it more when they offer me good deals.
---
GW2 always made it hard for me to whale for it because it made convenience items so damn expensive. Seriously, why does a revive orb cost dollars when it should cost cents. The same goes for a lot of items. I could buy whole games for the cost of things like the salvage tools or the like. And I did buy them because it offered some amount of convenience and furthered development.
---
After two years of playing, starting near the end of Season 3, I actually regret spending everything I have spent. I never once considered it benefiting me from the P2W perspective - any game that does that will **never** see a dime from me, because it's bullshit. It isn't fun. I supported GW2 not to get an edge, but because I wanted to see it grow and improve. It was an investment in the quality of the game in the long term. And that investment didn't pay off.
---
Between the lootboxes, the lack of performance improvement, the way features were only halfway developed, how player feedback was disregarded, total lack of communication, and now the drop in quality in a more absolute sense - I honestly regret whaling for this game. I wish I hadn't.
---
Yes. Shame that nothing i said was factually wrong though. Then you might have a point.
---
People can upvote or downvote whoever they want.
---
But... But think of all the clicks you can save by using templates! /s
---
Traits aren't automatically changed anymore
---
I love sci-fi and fantasy worlds, have nothing against people loving to cosplay and living out their fantasies. But i really found this vid cringey and hard to watch. Just my subjective opinion before you roast me for not agreeing with you.
---
Charr player here. For me, personally, its good how it is. Dont wanna be like norn, or human.
---
Nice kill.
---
Two days later: all build templates-related actions receive 30 second cooldown because removing passive effects between different specs leads to horrible bugs and we know how Anet's code "works" so... cooldowns!
---
What is a Quiznos?
---
&gt; simply because they can.
---
I'd argue that very often it's not even that, but more the factory of addiction and all the psychological tricks developers use to lure people into their shops
---
Is your wow friend a PvP'er?  If not this won't matter to them.
---
happy to see SC is still going strong
---
I'm just here for the chick in the sexy armour.
---
Can you please elaborate why would you use the candy corn gobbler on a key farm run?
---
I really have a hard time to get this mindset. Why would one invest in an uncertain and never clearly formulated promise, instead of saying "hey company, here's the deal: you deliver and then I'll buy"
---
I wouldn't know, I'm less than 2 weeks into GW2, though I'm glad it's a proper in-built thing now, especially now that I have a lot more of an idea of what I'm doing :D
---
Eh how did you come to that conclusion? Everytime something in the gem store appeals to a lot of people the gold-&gt;gem conversion goes noticeable up. When templates released it barely moved and even dropped next day. Ergo templates are a monetary failure. Nobody is buying them.
---
Quiznos was kinda like Subway, but most of them closed around a decade ago. apparently there are a few still around, but they're all like 75-150 miles from where anyone actually lives.
---
I suppose it could be boiled down to that well enough actually!
---
Nice story, now i'm really looking forward to getting better :D
---
I like soloing stuff, like the big and hard enemies in TERA that you meet every now and then. It takes a while but it's so great when you finally learned the mechanics and killed it.
---
But for now i keep exploring, leveling to 80 and not pressure myself too much if i die 10 times to a champion...at least the other players are great and always revive me :D
---
Chrono can do anything but heal.
---
How does a staff get you extra clones?  Every weapon set gives you 1 clone and 1 phantasm ability.
---
I chcecked browser nothing appears
---
There are raiding games like wow and ff14. You can even make real money on raiding and make it your job. While in gw2 you just waste your time and effort.
---
seriously most pvers enter wvw with whatever they have equipped just a small % uses differnt equip wvw/pve. pvp has it's own fake equip so it's not a problem at all.
---
Also whenever new Masteries are introduced, you can stack a bunch of XP boosts including Gobbler's to level them faster.
---
Class swapping as part of Class Retraining Kit on Gemstore or BL chest drop.
---
I really shouldn't give them ideas.
---
I am with you wiqo666 Agreed I DO, and doesnt matter if you are strange, we all are stranger for anet, they only want is money, but for a dead game, no ty
---
&gt; These people want to pay to win, and, more importantly, pay to look good/better than everybody else.
---
TIL paying for cosmetics is more important than pay2win lmao. This is the most gw2reddit thing i've ever read.
---
why is their marketing always so weird and bad?
---
I'm glad to see you still making gw2 content, Sammpo;  You're one of the people that motivated me to make GW2 videos years ago :D
---
So I come back to gw2 every once in a while and I realize that I leave the game because Ive never made it to "end game" and that's because I'm not really sure how. I want to come back with a plan of what I'm going to do. Currently I'm in the middle of HoT playing a warrior. I would love to pvp and do dungeons. 
---
Do I need to finish HoT?
---
Do I need to get the living world episodes?
---
Is there a similar system to the mythic+ dungeons in wow?
---
Are there good resources for pvp builds, rotations, comps?
---
yikes not sure if this guy is serious or not... imagine thinking having fun doing something you like is a waste of time
---
There's two in my city, but I'd rather go to nearly any other sandwich place over quiznos.
---
When you talk about 1-3 sec durations--the game really is that fast. A 3 second stun is a life time when you get used to the pace.
---
Gw2 is at its heart an action game, whereas many MMOs are at their hearts RPGs. With that action game lineage comes a much faster pace and a bigger emphasis on avoiding damage. It takes practice but I think you'll get it. As a Mesmer you have the most evades out of any profession, and that's the main way you'll avoid damage. That and teleports to escape hits.
---
Absolutely, yes. 
---
The recent template drama likely won‚Äôt effect you at all. The game is easy to return to and has tons of content waiting for you.
---
Ahh, i can see where the complaints are comming from then.
---
No offense but you dont know enough about economics or game design to make the sort of statements youre making.
---
Corrigiblity! We don't tolerate that sort of thing around here.
---
What's the reason for core guards over DH or more FBs? Looked like the DH had pretty similar dps as the core guards but I feel like there's a specific reason you chose so many core.
---
your kill was very well thought out too :)
---
As a hardcore player and an ex-casual roleplayer I can say: nobody cares about your opinion :D!
---
POF was the last thing I bought. I don't care about cosmetics, so not a lot to spend money on.
---
I ended up spending a lot more money on ESO than GW2, buying DLC and expansions despite only playing it for a tiny fraction of the time I played GW2. 
---
I have to admit that for me GW2 is great value. I bought the base game at launch, HOT, and POF and a character slot. Thousands of hours and I think less than ¬£100 spent.
---
I laughed today when i reflected one Dual pistol thief watching him killing him self to my reflect. With that i don't mean to say you should not play it like that, i just say a lot of classes have solid blocks and relfects and invuln and you will likely only get newer players with it or someone out of cool downs. But i guess that can be fun too.
---
lol how do you get that many burn stacks in the first place?
---
The circlejerk has hit peak pepega
---
PvP build templates will come later.  They stated this in the announcement.  Because PvP is so different.
---
Achievements in the festival categories will be locked with those categories until next year.
---
The rest will be available all year long.
---
Or Anet are jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire with the replacement being appointed by NCSoft and being there largely to appease them as the owner of Anet.
---
The recent controversy is toward vets with half a dozen builds for at least one class.  The game is still great for casual and returning players.  If you buy PoF, you get HoT for free.  Both expansions have lots of content to keep you busy.
---
Patch Notes stated:  Two new weapons have been released from the Mad King's vaults: earn the Carapace of Chaos shield and Last Rites greatsword by completing new collection achievements. These achievements can be completed year-round.
---
if those are the collections you were asking about...
---
Only training raids will teach someone
---
I always tell them plenty of people still play and I'm having a good time. I haven't found a better MMO for someone who plays like i do. I guarantee you I'd not want to play a lot of the games they play...shrugs.
---
you are right. but u know exactly as much as me, tx god anet had person with more experience and since they decided to set a max and economy is still working it mean he had some point. 
---
but hey i love how u think a single item cosmetic should completely change a whole working economic system. such arrogance
---
The development cost of a Royale is also much cheaper as you just procedurally generate a huge terrain then make some random outposts around the map and add loot spawn points to them, job done. Then you slap rolling seasons on it with some cosmetic skins attached and you have easily recouped all of your development costs.
---
Making an MMO is a much bigger undertaking that requires years of work and brings no income during the development.
---
The general state of the game for casual PvE'ers and people like me who prefer open world content is pretty good. The state of the game for people who want hard core "end game" content is pretty bad. 
---
There's plenty wrong with the templates, but they're not affecting me personally, not much anyway.  But since you've left there's a ton of good stuff in the game as well. Gliding and mounts were done very well for example. The HoT maps are harder open world content some people really like and the PoF maps are more casual explorable content for people who like that sort of thing. 
---
There'll be plenty for you to do and there's plenty of people still playing.

The only Quiznos even remotely near me is listed as Permanently Closed. The last review for that location was 6 years ago.

Yes, every time I am in Black Citadel I see Charr running on 2 paws rather than all 4. I want that too!

If you install boot camp on your Mac you will be able to use arcdps through Windows, the graphics drivers are also better in Windows so your game performance will be higher and you can use d912pxy to get even better performance.
---
Yeah they are malicious browser extensions though

He also gets fed free items and gold left and right, and pretends like he's earned it all himself.
---
The whole "master" series is basically him getting others to feed him stuff to 100% complete his account, under the guise of a "community goal".
---
It's quite despicable, and his fanboys are some of the most blind and willfully ignorant people I've ever seen.
---
yup
---
Its easy to like gw2 as new player.
---
This sounds about right. Seems like some people would rather design a square stone wheel instead of a modern car tire just because it's different.
---
Not if it means hoarding items that other players could benefit from. A Legendary weapon should not exist as a value sink, it should exist as something players can have fun swinging around. If it's just sitting in a bank somewhere then it's not fulfilling that purpose. 
---
The economy in a game should only function as a way to facilitate players getting the items they want, a way for players to access items that they couldn't get from the game directly for some reason, OR to take an item they have, but do not want, and receive some alternate compensation for it. 
---
Any time an ingame economy is not providing one of these services, it is an unhealthy distortion of that economy. The economy should be about servicing the players, not servicing itself.
---
The template fiasco is probably less of a concern to you and really has little to do with whether the game is "on its way out", they just over-monetized a hotly desired feature while under-delivering on it, which is something that happened to this game before and many other games like it even at times of peak success.

What might be more concerning as far as the long-term state of this game were two incidents earlier this year: (1) that the company experienced some mass lay-offs and (2) that the CEO resigned later on to start a small company. For issue 1, we did find that the lay-offs were largely due to mismanagement of other projects, not GW2, and the lay-offs did mean somewhat of a refocus towards GW2, which we'll hopefully see the benefits of. Issue 2 is really hard to determine whether its a good or bad thing in the long run. The original CEO (Mike O'Brien) definitely cared about his company and the game, it was his first company that he dedicated a lot of his own work and ideas too for nearly 2 decades. From my point of view, he was a talented developer and probably quite caring but ineffective in his position. The company flopped way too much on its strategy for development, communication, etc. and that kind of mismanagement starts from the top and trickles all the way down leading to a lot of missed opportunities and poor communication. We can only hope that whoever takes charge of this game puts their foot down on what their company culture is going to be and what that will mean for this community.

Now, it is a 7-year old game, so I can't say we should all expect it to deliver some amazing ground breaking stuff. However, the expacs (2 of them bundled) is like ~$30 and will get you access to a lot more content than buying a new game today at ~$60, and there's still a very active player-base across most areas of the game to do that content with (and if you ever struggle to find groups doing content, you can always start something up - people will join in eventually!). Whether the game goes into maintenance mode in 4 years from now or not is not going to make playing the expacs any less worth it.
---
I'm sure anet's reason for the 10k cap is technical not an economic decision. Also, its not just a single cosmetic item, but you still haven't advanced an argument for why **something** worth more than 10k gold is inherently bad.
---
Have fun :)
---
&gt; LOL you can't declare something to be objectively better by fiat. 
---
Sure you can, when it's accurate. I can declare that fewer people starving is objectively better than more people starving. 
---
&gt;From my perspective, it would be worse if everyone who wanted one had one.
---
Then your perspective is flawed.
---
I have been playing now for about 5 months. I bought GW2 not long after release in Feb 2013 then didn't continue to play. I relate completely to what you are saying for the most part. I adore the game right now. If there is one thing that annoys me a tiny bit, it's the inability (on some maps, certainly not all) to get content completed because they are so little used. Things like the Cin's Business collection for which I need one piece from a particular event.
---
Having said that, in any game when content has been out quite a while the majority of players have already taken what they need from it, so I completely understand how this happens. GW2 is fantastic, I can see myself playing for years.....
---
I love your simple approach to life. Especially how you think your subjective analysis is objective but other peoples' isn't.
---
Shit like this is the only reason I am still subbed to this sub
---
Ok, so what is your counterargument to "fewer people starving is better than more people starving?"
---
And just to elaborate on that, the "Festival Collections" achievement under the Collections tab isn't considered a "festival category" despite the name.
---
Its a convenience that saves you 10 seconds max if you know your shit around changing traits, making fun of people that cry for 10 seconds is fine in my book
---
damn, Mo'.
---
That stuff can still be done, it just has to be organized. It's an MMO, you can't do it alone, but you can organize. The worst time to try to organize is during a festival though.
---
&gt;But it is fair to be unhappy with how he covered it; though, instead of missing key points I think it might have been that he didn't want to go into all the details that informed his opinion since the video wasn't solely about Build Templates.
---
That's a fair point‚Äîand you might well be right‚Äîbut that would make the matter worse, not better, in my opinion; purposefully downplaying concerns that don't fit his narrative is worse than ignorance, to me. As to not wanting to go into details, well, he should have addressed it fully or not at all, I say, because as it is he gave a very one-sided account of the matter and dismissed everything else as "whining".
