I've never seen that name without emoji.  [Cloudfly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/85t2ig/a_gift_for_the_golden_god_emperor_of_jade_quarry/) didn't make it &amp; has swung so many match ups
---
---
---
On my mesmer I have a Heroic Dragonsblood sword mainhand and Chaos Sword offhand. They sit at different heights on the waist and it looks stupid. The DB sword looks like it's dragging along the ground because it sits lower. I don't get how they messed that up.
---
All you have to do while 1v1ing a Berserker is dodge or block Headbutt. 
---

---
If you let them instantly Berserk mode it's kinda your own fault.
---
Other players?
---
Afaik thief has next to no outgoing heals.
---
That's concurrent players.
---
And if the game had 350k active players, they would've never released the info.
---
Oh yeh, it happens all the time, when a lot of gemstone items are being bought it gems are being bought Guild Wars has a bit of a brain fart.
---
Is it cheating to just go with Ad infinitum and heavy legendary armor?
---
I remember hearing about JPs via word of mouth of my friends rather than from the wiki or dailies. Exploration back then was amazing.
---
Nope. Scarlet, Elli, Moto, and Netto used holomancy too. They just did it in different ways.  
---
The first holosmiths are from Elona. They used knowledge learned from zephirites and their sun crystals to create their photon forge, which they use to create their holograms. That's why their weapons and utility skills create holograms that look orange like the sun magic from sun crystals. 
---

---
All Holosmiths are Holomancers,  but not all Holomancers are Holosmiths.
---
PoF masteries, crystal dragon line. It’s the last one I believe, as I’m working on that line currently  but that animation matches the description
---
No. They took over a mostly empty desert. Where they did conquer w big city it’s usually brief. They are shit.
---
As an OG GW player whos currently droolin over GW1 again, I support  this post.
---
That is the heal per pulse at its location. If it was a total of 1620 that would make it one of the crappiest heals.
---
Also, fun to use at the end of DS meta. You can raptor jump then use Bond of Faith to reach the next floating island incredibly fast.
---
Rebound!
---
thanks for the explanation
---
Paragon
---
Gain access to chant utilities.
---
Gain new f skills. Adrenaline allows you to activate the f skills. Use while a chant is active for bonus effect. 
---
Add "javalin" weapon type to game.
---
Run javalin/warhorn.
---
&gt; Well if you look at my comment, I said concurrent players. 
---
Ah my bad.
---
&gt; Concurrent players is a far more relevant statistic than anything else.
---
Dunno man. GW2 is casual game and will automatically have less concurrent players.
---
Bringing up the map, switching layers, and then directly teleporting to a waypoint will cost money. For cost purposes, Mistlock Sanctuary sits on the map just south of Claw Island and northeast of Southsun Cove.
---
That said, you can doubleclick your passkey item to return to whichever map you came from, and there's teleporter in the center that will take you to any of the six main cities at no cost.
---
If you're really trying to save on waypoint costs and don't mind an extra loading screen, you can that teleporter to go to the nearest city to where you want to go, then waypoint from there to save a little bit.
---
Would be extremely useless in pve.
---
With the recent shakeup there, I'm glad to hear that you've already got plans and will land on your feet. Congrats :)
---
Best not to build your identity around the ephemeral.
---
The system is incredibly effective. The number of actual innocent old gwamm accounts that got banned is undoubtedly several orders of magnitude fewer than the number of botters, syncers, and RMTers
---
Damn, if it's just 3 times the same reply per comment  feels so string!!
---
Source?
---
Proffesion/Class with build that can get the highest amount of quickness OUT OF BATTLE? with runes/gear that helps to get maximum amount of quickness? *Looking for a gear+prof for gathering home instance/pve maps/berries/guild nodes*
---
Power (Berserker) Reaper is very viable for fractals, especially since the latest changes (essentially a flat 10% damage boost and can heal yourself you full while in Shroud), and everyone already knows that Necro is the god of open world content.
---
One thing to bear in mind is that with proper traits you're only crit capped while in Shroud, so you want to set up as much of your burst in that window as possible. In fractals this is fine due to short burst windows being favorable. Imo it's not worth it to swap Berserker gear out for Assassin as the extra Precision is only useful on your Sharpening Stone while in Shroud (as you'll be at crit cap already) and you'll be reducing your overall Power at all times just to increase your sustained damage outside of Shroud by a little.
---
Silverwastes because materials.
---
Basically you save up all your bags of Gear and open them on a level 48 to 53 character, and you get gear that's level appropriate. You then salvage it for T4 Materials and sell them. They sell for more than late game materials because there are more people at level 80 and the market is flooded.
---
You get 0 Mastery Points for 100% Map Completion as it's a separate thing and not included in map completion. 
---
You need to do Map Completion to craft a Legendary weapon, so do that. Core Tyria for Gen 1, Heart of Thorns OR path of Fire for Gen 2.
---
Look at how cool this combat system is in this game! And how the progression isn't an infinite treadmill so you can experiment with builds and get to the game quickly! Plus there's heaps of QoL features that you'll wish every other game has.
---
Also there's barely any competitive or difficult content and what little is there is not really being supported, but you can dress up in open world and do a new mission every 3 months. And you still get to use the awesome combat system.
---
We helped kill Aurene in cold blood. Dont forget that one.
---
Dragonhunter w/ scepter/focus
---
gotta agree. The plot has been hashed out in broad strokes largely since day 1. You can hear it from the devs themselves every so often.
---
Some notes I'll make on their response: 
---
Only do the hearts if you want, don't feel like they are quests to do. The hearts are purely optional (though they do open up a vendor and count towards map completion). 
---
If you decide to do the dungeons (feel free to wait on them) make sure you look for a group (or better yet post your own) that says it is watching cut scenes or new. There will be groups out there looking for max level characters that already know what they are doing so just avoid them unless they say they are willing to go slow.
---
Feel free to jump into sPvP at any point since it levels the playing field and makes everyone the same. WvW however only level scales you to 80 and does not put you on par with actual level 80 characters, please try to avoid WvW until you actually hit 80 as you'll far outmatched there. There is a ton of other content to do in the meantime and leveling is very fast.
---
I'd suggest looking into crafting since you get exp from that (like just about everything) and you can take a look at my [WIP guide and resources](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Leveling).
---
so whats this supposed to show? i see 2-3 guilds outnumbering and handholding vs pugs
---
Many QoL things are subjective and each game has their own set of QoL, that's true. I guess many aspects of GW2 QoL makes the game relatively accessible and casual, so you get to enjoy the gameplay experience a lot more (at least from what I've found compared to other MMOs like FF). The problem is there aren't that many ways to enjoy it.
---
I haven't played it but the power burst shouldn't have changed much, you just have slightly weaker defensive options (but the idea was always to burst in and be able to get out when needed). I will say the introduction of mounts makes roaming a lot different and some of the assassinate builds have a harder time picking people off when they have an extra health bar.
---
To expand a bit, each tier has an achievement that you have to play at least 3 games each day for 15 days (so that is 45 days of 3 games at least) on top of that they have achievements to win a certain number in one day (at the last tier it is 6 games in one day I think). The big thing here is that you can do it being lower skilled but if you do not enjoy pvp it is a huge time sink (and a daily one at that) to get
---
Damn, Id fuck the shit out of that dragon-lady, even if shes sort of like my daughter Ill bust nuts all day
---
For anyone that finds this too late, or the good too expensive to make (&gt;1g per soup even with the recipe.) Avocado Smoothies are a much much cheaper decent replacement. I've not had anyone complain to me for using them.
---
IDK if it still is or not, but its definitely not bunker.
---
You are rather glassy when you use it.
---
Its mainly about helping allies as a floater portal jockey and getting insane burst off on them before they realize your there (Via ranged or stealth when they are already engaged)
---
Oh, that's a pretty cool advice, thanks. That makes it even better.
---
On the top from the ker of berserker, you can see power ranger :0
---
I can't imagine how that'd work in a thematic sense - besides we just had Warriors using a wimpy dagger with Spellbreaker, I don't want to see them using a healing staff next
---
The total dame you deal is the final number. You can also look at your combat log in the chat options
---
Nope, it dosent affect participation
---
Per Mike Z, Game Director:
---
&gt; The studio has recently been affected by layoffs, which is going to take some time to process. There’s no easy way for any team to adjust to that. We've had to say goodbye to friends and colleagues that we've worked alongside for years. We’re welcoming back some familiar faces to the Guild Wars 2 team that had been working on unannounced projects. After all is said and done, it's going to take some time for us to adjust to our staffing changes.

https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/69872/update-from-the-guild-wars-2-team#latest
---
&gt;Tell that to the people trying to keep the bloated creepers in Tequalt
---
Bloated Creepers have little health. Plus the zerg will dps it down too quick before it does any damage. Useless.
---
&gt;the hordes of branded in both Shatterers
---
The brand barely does anything to the zerg. Useless.
---
&gt;the corrupted from the sides in the Claw
---
Barely does anything to the zerg. Useless.
---
&gt;or the seekers in Vale Guardian,
---
Dunno about Vale Guardian since I am not a raider. But if raid groups can do the raid without it, then bringing a elite spec that is centered around it would be a waste of space. Useless.
---
&gt;anywhere that spwns all those annoying risen plague carriers
---
Kill them when they spawn. Useless.
---
&gt; those annoying rolling golems at the Mark II golem
---
Barely annoys a zerg. Useless.
---
&gt;basically anywhere where you want to keep any enemy from getting to an ally.
---
And then the enemies with breakbar walks through anyways and gets to the ally. Useless. 
---
Just use a guardian with Staff or hammer, and you will find there is little to no useful application to put wards anywhere. The best you could do is plop it down and hope something trips on it.
---
The content goes on hiatus. I never insinuated that they kick their feet up and chill.
---
How long does it take to farm gold??
---
That makes sense - there's a mesmer on TC called "Utterly Confusing" or something that wears the Ronald McDonald look.
---
I like how by the time it's gotten back to the start again, step 2 has already changed :)
---
Ah! Finally I don't find this too late! Thank you very much!
---
GW2 brings me back because the combat is great, untapped potential, especially in the various PvP modes. But yes, not a great long-term game, as the sparse content burns you out quickly. Luckily the fact that gear matters very little makes the game still playable.
---
Although coming back to the game every few months to romp around in PvP game modes and play with guilds in WvW probably isn't the typical MMO experience. I guess GW2 offers something different.
---
Ok, thanks!
---
is there a site with what theyre selling every day?
---
Most classes have lots of dps since every class is balanced around damage. Each class has a different focus and I'll list them below, but most classes will have atleast one spec that focuses on high dps. This post is rather long, but my recommendations are at the end.
---
Warrior: average damage with high survivability 
---
\*High DPS - Warrior Elite 1: Berserker - higher damage with a more damage oriented ability spread. Uses its berserk stance to gain access to primal bursts and output high amounts of damage
---
Warrior Elite 2: Spellbreaker - Boon gain and boon removal oriented spec with average damage and higher survivability. 
---
Guardian: average damage with high survivability  (warrior focuses on high health and invulnerability whereas guardian focuses on blocks and heals)
---
\*High DPS - Guardian Elite 1 - Dragonhunter- very bursty spec that trades some of guardians survivability for massive damage especially in the beginnings of fights when its traps are off cooldown.
---
Guadian Elite 2 - Firebrand - average condition dps with great group damage buffs, group healing, and group utility
---
Revenant - mediocre dps class (I'm not super experienced with revenant or its specs so I won't go much in depth)
---
Revenant Elite 1 - Herald - Focuses on pulsing boons to yourself and allies 
---
Revenant Elite 2 - Renegade - Focuses on giving allies unique renegage specific boons that grant damage and survivability. 
---
Ranger - good damage and good survivability with its pet
---
Ranger Elite 1 - Druid- Incredible amounts of healing, and boons to allies but lacks in damage compared to its core specialization
---
\*High DPS Ranger Elite 2 - Soulbeast - Focuses on utilizing your pet to gain damage and unique abilites
---
Thief - Good damage but weak survivability, need to use evades to play properly
---
\*High DPS Thief Elite 1 - Daredevil - High damage with high amounts of evades and consistent damage over a fight
---
\*High DPS Thief Elite 2 - Deadeye - High amounts of focused single target damage from range. Lacks in mobility and cleave compared to daredevil, but makes up for it in raw damage
---
Engineer- difficult to play for mediocre dps - stay away unless you know what you're doing or you plan on playing one of the elite specs
---
Engineer Elite 1 - Scrapper - A tanky sustained damage bruiseresque spec, with good utility. A very potent healing spec for WvW and PvP
---
\*High DPS - Engineer Elite 2 - Holosmith - A mobile easy to play dps spec that brings good survivability and high burst
---
Necromancer - Weak damage but very tanky - stay away unless you plan on playing elite specs
---
Necromancer Elite 1 - Reaper -  Good damage and incredibly tanky. It's damage isn't nearly as high as other classes but it brings so much health that it tends to be able to do anything.
---
Necromancer Elite 2 - Scourge - Good damage and able to puke damage from good range. Very potent in PvP and WvW but mediocre in PvE, although it is incredible easy to play similarly to Reaper.
---
Mesmer: fun class but can lack in damage without elite specs
---
\*High DPS Mesmer Elite 1 - Chronomancer - Difficult to play but brings stupidly high burst, sustained dps, survivability, mobility, group utility. Good in pve, pvp, and some WvW. High learning curve to learn to play well but worth it if you put in the time. Spec is overtuned but not very nerfable IMO.
---
\*High DPS Mesmer Elite 2 - Mirage - Would be considered amazing but chronomancer exists. This is more potent for open world content as the playstyle is very easy and fluid, but is condi focused, compared to chronomancer's power focus.
---
Elementalist 1: Core elementalist is ok, but lacking the damage of it's elite specs.
---
\*High DPS Elementalist Elite 1 - Tempest - good area of effect damage, survivability, and group utility. Also incredibly easy to play while pumping out good damage
---
\*High DPs Elementalist Elite 2 - Weaver - incredibly fluid and fun playstyle with multiple builds types. Brings very high damage, burst, and some survivability, although the class is difficult as it requires a very involved playstyle that needs you to learn multiple abilites and how they work with one another.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Classes/Specs to not pick if you want damage: Revenant (this one is kinda debatable as it does have damage but I'm not a fan personally) , Druid(ranger elite) and necromancer
---
Classes to shy away from if you want an easy playstyle, but are worth learning if you want to have fun: Chronomancer(Mesmer), Mirage(Mesmer), Deadeye(Thief), Weaver(Elementalist)
---
Fun classes that bring lots of damage and are easy to get into: Daredevil (Thief), Warrior( All three specs are similar and its up to you which you prefer as they are all good damage), Tempest (Elementalist), Holosmith(Engineer), Soulbeast(Ranger), Dragonhunter(Guardian)
---
My Recommendations: Warriors are good for brute forcing your way through content with good damage (Spellbreaker and Berserker have been my pick for all PoF and LWS4 content). Deadeye is fun for ranged content and high spike damage, but you need to pay attention to your surroundings. Weaver is incredibly fluid, although you will need to focus on playing well in order to not die every fight.
---
Shows WvW PvP you ever been there before?
---
Just because you put in effort in something does not automatically mean everyone has to praise your work and give you compliments.
---
Can't handle someone not liking your art? Get out of art...it's not for you.
---
How come no one has mention the broken scrapper yet
---
Hi! Haven't played in 2 or 3 years.
---
1) Is there a compilation of everything that changed in WvW since then? I know you can glide and mount there but it doesn't look that different. I wish they did heavy changes because it wasn't very fun to deal with the point system, server changes and so.
---
2) I just missed the Alienware giveaway I'm so sad. I gave my account away years ago and now I have no money to buy the expansions. Trying some escapism to deal with my unemployment. Is it worth playing WvW as F2P?
---
Who cares about 1 green
---
It's not impressive.
---
This has been done countless number of times without organizing, in random maps at reset.
---
...but you felt good about doing it and had fun, right? Good! That is all that matters.
---
The thicc potato dragon will save us all

Your statement is, 'under 1% is pretty good'.  Where is your evidence anything mentioned is under 1%?

Why do people who don't know a damn thing always talk with such certainty.

The right to be forgotten is one of the key points of gdpr. Companies must absolutely demonstrate the ability to delete all data pertaining to a person on request.

You could similarly say you don't need to dodge if you have invulnerability passives
---
Add all auras to the wardrobe system, thus making them account wide.  Remove them from items, and instead have those items only unlock the aura.  Have a system similar to dyes to turn auras on and off.  This way, if I want to use a convenient legendary trinkets like aurora, I'm not forced to have the balls floating near my head.  Similarly, if I like it, I can have the balls floating by my head on all my characters.

"Your current ability is fully trained and ready to master". How do I turn this off I haven't unlocked masteries yet and I'm doing the level 80 personal stories and this just pops up every 5 seconds. Kill me plz

"What?"

*Chickens.*

"What about it?"

*Must. Chase. Chickens.*

Before the dark sorcerer could protest, his mind was taken over. He was now the servant of the Ipos, forever cursed to chase chickens.

I think Anet should just make a craftable potion, fractal slaying potion.  There, easy, works in all fractals, no more hassle using a different potion for different maps/bosses.  Maybe give it multiple recipes and make it a sink for fractal junk such as mini professor mew, blade shards, even agony.
---
And you're not posting a link why?

Where should I upload it? It's a little java program packed into an exe.

So the damage per tick is constant unless crit?

I just wanna farm elder woods in peace goddamnit.

You're missing a bunch of spikes.

What am I supposed to see in that clip? Proof that he bought a dhuum CM? because it still doesn't say anything about him

As an ESL teacher, let me tell you this - many people who study the language know a lot more about it then native speakers, don't ever put yourself down!
---
So what you're saying is that Holosmiths are squares?

Not necessarily. I just used the same number to make the example easier to understand.

I like it but I wish it just used your glider not the crystal wings, it looks really awkward if you use it and go into a glide.

I've managed to participate in Single Burn phase once long ago. I agreed, it is glorious!
---
Here's a few, finally got around to it.  
---
First, this one is not mine, but I saw it in Mistlock and happened to grab a picture. [Winnie the Pooh.](https://imgur.com/CmDUfZf)  
---
The next two are my attempts:  
---
[Beast, from Beauty and the Beast](https://imgur.com/OWkEmLZ). This one is a fairly new toon, and I usually use outfits for toons that aren't 80 so I don't have to look like I'm wearing a hodgepodge of random stuff. I noticed that a Charr in the Noble Count outfit looks like this character, so with a few adjustments, I decided to roll with it.  
---
And, my attempt at [Fina, from Skies of Arcadia](https://imgur.com/LbhYCcA). My poor, neglected Memser I've not learned much how to play. Still, I chose this character to be my mesmer since in \*Skies of Arcadia\*, Fina's weapon is Cupil, a shapeshifting, living ball of quicksilver that can take on the form of a weapon. It's something I thought at the time would fit the theme of a mesmer.
---
Let me fix this for you. 
---
&gt; It's ~~not~~ impressive.
---
This has been done ~~countless number of times without organizing, in random maps at reset~~ before, but it's still impressive every time it happens.
---
~~...but you felt good about doing it and had fun, right? Good! That is all that matters.~~  Congratulation!.
---
On holo take H-M-M in Holosmith trait line. It gives you 15% damage reduction while in photon forge and increases your heat capacity by 50%.
---
You can wield a sword and shield. It has 2 CC skills, reflect and block (and block causes daze to enemies). Also 3rd sword skill gives you quickness.
---
Rest of the build can be meta. This also works pretty well in fractals and raids.
---
uhh, the comment you were responding to was just making a joke. don't take it so srs
---
I have a strange appreciation for this post and I don't know why.
---
''I would like to rage!''
---
There are content-focused guild like raid/fractals guilds, WvW guilds, RP guilds. If you don't have experience in raids and you want to get in, then the best way to do it is join a raid guild.
---
When everyone is asking for 150KP (I have only 30 at this moment) in 100CM (fractal), I can run with my two guilmates and noone will ask me for linking KP. This works also in raids.
---
Difficult content is always easier with guildmates, not pugs.
---
Also guild can be a great community.
---
For PvP its sadly the most active one, Metabattle is never really good, but the only source now for pvp builds
---
The LS4 mount masteries just so much better than the LS3 ones. 
---
With the exception of the downed state LS3 one (and, I guess, the bloodstone counter), they were all too situational. Some were literally single-map novelties.
---
I think that's unfortunately not the case since February 2018 when Impossible Odds lost its Quickness generation aspect (keeping only the Superspeed) while gaining the "extra strike" mechanic.
---
for optimal (speedrun) raids http://snowcrows.com/
---
WvW http://builds.vabbi.org/
---
Fractals etc https://discretize.eu/builds
---
though, we just had a balance patch so it might take a while for the builds to get tested and adjusted to those changes.
---
it's alright as a starting point, tho it's always better when you know how to adapt to different situations
---
Thanks. Very helpful. I'll check them out. :)
---
Yeah. I wanted to follow something relevant and learn, maybe take off from there and make something of my own.
---
Well, I suppose [the scroll](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Orrian_History_Scrolls#Arah:_City_of_the_Gods_and_The_Tragedy_of_Malchor) is ambiguous about it. I get that interpretation. A lot of romantic tropes can easily become creepy depending on how you interpret the characters involved. There's so much leeway given that it's easy to imagine one's own version of events.
---
Personally, that sort of unrequited love creeps me out when I think about it, so when there's ambiguity I prefer to take a positive interpretation. Plus, I'm a real sucker for forbidden love as a trope. So that's not helping the issue.
---
welp, i'm dead
---
holy moly
---
so you say there are no counters ever then in the very next reply you say how you almost never lose as scrapper vs mirage
---
so no counters but your build counters another build
---
mental gymnastics champion!
---
also the pvp equivalent of "well dh gets outdpsed by reaper is the dh is bad"
---
which is useless "info" and highly misleading
---
is a skateboard faster than a car if the driver is a bonobo? yea but like..useless pointless "fact"
---
Player base falls off naturally, even WoW has a much smaller player base than it once did and thats one of the most advertised games ever, everyone has heard of WoW.
---
GW2 is actually on the upswing though because its still remains one of the best MMO's it has so much content in it at the moment and there are no new MMO's coming out in the foreseeable future.
---
idk what's "unlucky" about that, he just misplayed.
---
This is way too adorable, I love your art style.
---
The one-handed weapons' tendency to change position based on leggings can cause clipping issues of their own, unfortunately. Sometimes they end up clipping with the legs/leggings if they're too close; sometimes they clip with the arms/sleeves/gloves if they're too far out.
---
Limitting your fps reduces GPU load only when your current fps would be above the limit. I doubt that your fps limit has any effect on your fans when playing the game with a lot of players around, like in towns, big PvE events or WvW zerging. Thats when your fps are likely to be below the limit. Did you only test this in a lone area? Or did you change something else as well?
---
No, you just haven’t realized the negatives
---
Brutal!
---
Awesome work!
---
What are the hands and legs called on number 3?
---
probably. 
---
are you CC'ing her when she's reviving garm?
---
what build are you running?
---
are you utilizing the mushrooms in the arena?
---
Expanding on this, M-M-M (so,  [Prismatic Converter](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prismatic_Converter) rather than  [Light Density Amplifier](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Light_Density_Amplifier)) is great for easy open-world content because it lets you remove up to 3 conditions after you finish fighting a mob, so you don't need to wait for Healing Turret or for the conditions to naturally expire before you can mount up again. (Maybe I'm just overly annoyed by those really long Chill effects in Bitterfrost...)

It involves a lot of grinding games, Ad Infinitum is child’s play in comparison. I own 6 legendaries (Gen1, Gen2 and even Aurora etc) and I’ll say The Ascension required the most work out of them all. I was about 1-2 wins away from Platinum when I crafted my Ascension. 
---
Since you have Warbringer, perhaps you’re ok with grinding matches. Then it’s just a matter of gitting gud and developing a thick skin. Losing matches can be demoralising, esp if you get a toxic player on your team. 
---
It took me three seasons total to get the back piece. I was so burned out by the end of it I haven’t played pvp much until this day.
---
Kill Garm and Eir will Tp to him to res him. You need to CC her to stop her resing Garm. After you break her you can kill her. Repeat this 2-3 times depending on your demage and your team. Mostly the only thing you need to pay attention the most are 2 skills. First one is basicly a Mordrem Sniper shot wich will leave a mark on the ground. That mark on the ground could kill you easily if you will not pay attention. But the most deadlier skill she can use are fire arrows from above. When those will start to rain you need to run and not step into the fire. Those oneshoted even the biggest tanks in the game.
---
&gt;Why don't you think we should drop quickness and alacrity and allow Chronos to be a DPS class?
---
They already are.
---
If you use Candy Cane Gobbler it would give you PvE buffs as well, witch dissapear once you go in actual WvW
---
No. 
---
Power is viable everywhere, condi might be better in a few places though. Start with a power set and build towards vipers gear in the meantime.
---
This is a mastery from the mastery tree that was introduced with the S4.
---
It is obviously tied to PoF as it gives more skills to mounts, that are unavailable if you don't own PoF.
---
It gives -so far- 3 skills : One that replaces your mount life by yours (situationnal), one that makes the Endurance recharge way faster (really good), and this one that makes you "leap" from your mount (really good, low cooldown, allows for some jumps/combinaison that are both fun and efficient
---
You have to put Garm down first to force Eir into healing him, distracting her for a few seconds and making her vulnerable to attacks. Rinse and repeat.
---
In my experience it is a lengthy fight with ample time for you to make mistakes, especially when multiple charged shot tails are active, and Eir punish heavily any missteps.
---
If you find the fight to difficult try picking another ally in Braham stead, because the only way to go over Eir is by trial and error
---
I knew it was you before i even clicked on the post.

That's why I didn't see them. THank you so much!

You dont have friends.. you dont have a guild . You have a family

I'm gonna assume your gear is broken to all hell by now, which is probably one of the major reasons you're having so much trouble.
---
Also, based on the rest of the comments, I see you've been playing 3 days. Do you know how to put a build together? I'm guessing that's one of your issues. For example, if you're rocking Mesmer Greatsword with Condition Damage, you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Have you tried looking at metabattle? The really popular are best builds are on there
---
Thats great! I did meta today and the map completed it with 7 min left. To me its already impressive  :)
---
I didn't measure decibels. But it was distracting and annoying even in headphones
---
Why does necro get shark bites on auto crit but mesmer doesn't? Rerolling.
---
That looks awesome!
---
this, I know about this (unless at least one person get it noone see it)
---
good, so no crazy achiv :)
---
I had similar problem at the beginning of gw2 when I left game for some time after I explored world (thinking that's the point) and did story. Of course there were different times back then with lack of good endgame and a possibility to screw class build (what I did). Also being necro back then was a pain.
---
This because I came straight from games like lineage 2 and wow, and in gw I felt lost with nothing really to do.
---
Things changed since then :)
---
It’s less effort to toss them into storage and talk to the vendor later than trashing them all the time, IMO. 
---
But if people want to throw away their loot, they are entitled to do that.
---
Ey, go fuck yourself
---
Lich form 4 creates minions that explode so you precast lich form 4 then do the normal reaper burst (gs 4, damage well, gs5 then reaper shroud 4)
---
The minions spawn and explode during the burst.
---
If you ever get caught in any situation in GW2 were you simply don't know what to do we have the best Wiki out there. Lie for example today you could have written /wiki Hearts and Minds in to the chat box and you will be taken to a wiki page who will tell you how everything in this fights works and everything else around this chapter. Works with anything in game down to the smallest crafting materiel or trophys to the bigger things.
---
Oh yeah, point taken, its carry potential isn't as high as healing Firebrand, especially in encounters where important mechanics can be Aegis blocked. But it's also miles better than a Druid at converting a team that can't beat an encounter into one that can.
---
Is there even a single meta build where this is the case? The issue is that builds that require that much precision usually benefit more from running an accuracy sigil (147 precision is almost always better than 3% from impact) or a different runeset, thief runes in particular. Not building for SNSBSS also gives you issues when you have to adjust for spotter, no spotter, fractal pot, etc.
---
Yeah Berserker armor/weapon and Diviner trinkets is standard for Quickbrand I think when using Feel my Wrath, maybe with Diviner weapon over Zerker weapon but Diviner armor should be overkill even for Raid. 
---
One can use the same setup with Hammer over Scepter/Focus, but having some sort of ranged weapon is very good in open world IMO.
---
But Druid already covers that, so why not take a better dps class over a mediocre boon sharer that just overlaps with Druid?
---
This was take 20 or something right? :)
---
Could you elaborate on this a bit? What's wrong with setting max FPS at 60? And how Radeon Chill works so that it's better?
---
She doesn’t have high HP, there is an obvious mechanic Braham clearly explains that makes her vulnerable. Pay attention to what is said and pay attention to what your foes do. Eir is the easiest of all the encounters in that instance, especially once you add the bugs the others had. 
---
Of course you could go back and choose someone else if it’s still a problem.
---
Digging the foefire (?) pirate.

You can check the [official retailer list](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/), so far all I've seen sell physical cards they need to send you though so that might be an issue. I'd be careful buying from unofficial sites too.

Yh, my country isn't on the list :/

&gt; when she heals him just dps
---
Sound advice if you want to spend all day on the encounter. If you'd rather no have to down Garm a dozen times, use CC to break blighted Eir's defiance bar when she starts to revive Garm. This causes her to be stunned for 15 seconds.
---
I appreciated the joke for what it's worth lol.

Not sure if you can purchase from US store if you live outside the states.

Historical low on that site was 31,99 so i think it's ok price right now.

Nice try, but not even close. The uncontested "Unluckiest Mesmer" of all time still remains unchallenged.

There is no situation really, just very low interest in gw2 and they stopped selling them here a couple of years ago. I found some amazon sellers with good feedback so I'll try those
---
...and reddit downvotes you because they're too stupid to get the joke.
---
Try using it right after clicking jackals jump, insane momentum.
---
I live in EU and bought it on DLgamer without any issues. I paid 37€ which is a fair price in my opinion.
---
no it's not. hate = / = incompetence. they've already proven in the past that they have made mistakes and refused to listen to anyone else on the matter until they were forced to hand over information under GPDR laws and one of their own customers did their job better than they did, he investigated the false bans and found that they contained false positives. I'm not entirely sure that anet actually investigates anything unless it blows up on reddit, they always say it but the outcome of their investigation is wrong.
---
This kind of issue will be fixed quickly don't worry.
---
pChrono and Sw/D Weaver are two that come to mind instantly, but the big boys of DH/DD who are king on quite a few fights are obviously excluded.
---
I think it comes down to what you think is more problematic personally, spending more gold on food to have an easier time swapping, or spending more gold/drops on armour and using templates to swap. If you're FCing and using the same char, deleting 100pow/70fero for other foods quickly adds up, but if gold isn't an issue to you, this doesn't matter, and makes adjustment easier. If you're swapping between subgroups/specializations etc. frequently though, and have to spend all that gold on food, it quickly adds up.
---
Okay. Maybe you are on non-English megaservers or something.
---
It's a game not rocket science.
---
with a name like that i'm not surprised you think that
---

---
Depends on the soulbeast build.
---
Boonbeast is tanky/sustain I've dropped a few but most of the time they back off after taking off 70% HP so you can decide if you want to pursuit or leave. But  always follow up with Volley (4-5k+ per hit) + skill #2 hits alright.... skill #4 is a distancing evade backwards. Feels clunky + cast time, only recommend using it to re-position or if you desperately need to evade something.
---
Sic Em ranger... yeah. It's dead if they don't dodge Gun Flame. Running into a lot that don't even take passive stone sig either. gg.
---
Well you gotta go SOMEWHERE to make the ascension work

open world fucking around and achievement hunting
---
I love how many ways this community will pretend balance issues arent issues. Powercreep is a real thing and has a lot of downsides. Content becoming too easy is one of them.
---
There are no meaningful rewards for repeatedly handicapping yourself intentionally. People will do it once or twice for fun, get bored and leave.
---
Tell me why then. Every single time you are just dissing my builds not saying why is so bad. Im able to do anything with this build. Stay long alive while teaching new players. Getting hit and yet able to describe all the atacks the enemy has. Ofcorse I didnt sait it will be the best for you or others or that you need to have this one. Im not like others who are forcing everyone here on reddit to play only meta builds and nothing else. Im giving him an option to consider this build, try it if he/she wants and then decide. 
---
Im use to your disses and they dont make me mad. Mostly just makes me dissapointed in you. The only people who would be dissing these posts are simple minded monkeys wich can do only one thing and one thing only. Trying to kill a boss with a stick. You dont even consider that there are other builds used for some other situations. Ofcorse my guaridan might not have the best demage but you know what ? If I would want to have the most demage I would go for zerk armor and everything else insted. If I would want to be tanking I would change into Nomad just for you. Why ? Because it doesnt mater and it never will. It doesnt mater what you and other players think, only maters with what build you feel you can do well.
---
There was many, many posts regarding this topic.
---
But using frame rate control WILL definitely introduce input lag, no matter how you look at it. This is confirmed and beyond debate.
---
Sure you can use it with other options, but in the end, it is up to you.
---
They perform similarly, but people found that using Chill is beneficial as it does not introduce input lag like FRTC does.
---
Despite GW2 being a horizontal only progression model and for the most part avoiding a hard "holy trinity" class system, its starting to descend into the same problem most typical theme park holy trinity based mmorpgs suffer from.
---
Its very much a "bring the class, not the player" that WoW famously has suffered from for years and still suffers from. The main reason being, unique class powers.
---
WoW gets a lot of heat for homogenization (read: dumbing down) and yet at the same time people complain that their chosen class isn't wanted in raids/mythic+ because they don't have &lt;insert unique effect&gt;
---
Then cut to GW2, where alacrity is still a premium, druids are still holding the healing role ransom(though its getting better), warriors have unique banners, hit boxes affect dps potential and vuln stack, fury uptime and might stack still varies massively between classes.
---
So its "bring the class, not the player" to the absolute extreme in GW2.
---
Aw, c'mon Monstrum, you usually do two joke comics before your depressing ones. Don't tell me next week will just be as horrifying as the death squeak?!
---
^(I hope it is.)
---
&gt;this is only my like 3rd day of playing this game
---
Eng since alpha. Braindead overpowered class.
---
Last night i ran Cms with a reaper. I was DD and the 3rd DPS was DH.
---
Both me and DH were 1-2k apart most fights. The reaper was outpdsing whichever was winning by 2-3k every time. I topped only 1 boss, the dh another, and reaper the other 4 :/
---
Now i'm not the best player (i play DD) but i'm around "good" DH in DPS (top CM DH players win, but i can outdps 99% of the T4 guardians i run into). The DH wasnt the absolute best there was but he wasnt bad by any stretch.
---
Afk farming.
---
Nothing will prevent players to become better than the game eventually, ever. Powercreeping the (existing) content is not a solution.
---
Problem with condi builds in fractals is that a lot of bosses have phases, which interrupts your condition application. FB's condition application is at least bursty enough so that it's not that detrimental, but in an ideal composition (IE: groups that are experienced and DPS rather well) condi FB will likely fall behind their power counterpart since Power Quickbrand is so strong in fractals at the moment. 
---
Condi FB will shine more in raids, but it also depends on the boss mechanics. Websites with raid builds will often display the bosses that those builds shine on, and how to effectively play those bosses, so it'd be on you to do some research into that prior. 
---
Dungeons are the same as fractals, but people are less likely to care about the build you're running, so Vipers should be okay. Honestly, it's never a bad idea to make a set of Berserker's for *any* class, because you'll never know when you need to swap elite specs or anything (and since Berserker's is easy to make or buy). I didn't mention WvW, but minstrels should be fine.
---
Is the current system not dumb?  We run all 3 fractal potions plus a different utility for each fractal.  Just takes up a bunch of inventory space to hold all those potions.
---
It still wouldn't solve the problem with these specific potions. Sure, you'd be able to run a generic buff utility - actually you can do that now as well, just use your "normal" utility - but if you want to min/max you'll still need a way to get them.
---
this can have different reasons but one thing is the cause of this, your client not being in sync with the server most of the time.
---
Sometimes it can happen that some Effect you looked for doesn't get rendered for whatever reason and you get damaged because of it. That can happen with anything like animation of an enemy.
---
But if you see the animation and, for example, the AoE on the ground but you already got the damage because of it then the reason for this could be
---
* Package loss (packages from the server are getting lost somewhere)
---
* your computer is running so slow that your client is busy doing other things and not being able to render the new things quick enough
---
or even a combination of both. So my questions would be: Do you have noticeable lag? High ping? rubber banding? Or just general that your game is stuck and "speeds up" occasionally? What is your connection in your LAN, wire or wireless? How is the game behaving in "vanilla mode" (without hook and Arcdps etc)?
---
While the OP is probably taking a tad too aggressive of a stance, actively gimping yourself doesn't feel like a valid solution to content being too easy/classes being too strong.
---
Sure, but then what your proposing isn't really an alternative to what OP is suggesting.  OP is actually suggesting something that would be used in normal groups.
---
World Boss train
---
Not really sure about calling everything sub 150 kp low, and about suggesting people run two healers in such a setup. At that point you're just giving your group way more time to suffer against mechanics, and arkk below 40% becomes hell because of your non-existent dps
---
Dailies in PvE and PvP waiting for the next Le haven't been doing a lot else
---
So let met get this straight, you decided to comment that 'under 1% is pretty good', but you don't actually believe the error rate is under 1%.  Tell you what, why don't you clarify for me, what your position is.
---
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
[You're becoming as psycho as Mario ;_;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9x4o1gAzTc)
---
I think that's the achievement where we chase the giant ley line man and make sure he doesn't absorb any magic
---
You just do missions slowly. As you already mentioned there's one person bounty, treks and races. There are also wvw and PvP dailies that could be doable. Not looked in ages as I'm in a large guild, but I build mine up on the side slowly
---
Low group dps could also be because people are not as comfortable with their rotation yet. I'm all for a single healer in newer groups, but how would a group with both a healing renegade and firebrand go about getting a siax kill?
---
I remember whenever I got a minstrel chrono in a pug it was nearly impossible to kill our illusion during split. If new players aren't familiar with mechanics, do you think they'd be able to carry the dps for two zero dps specs in a (for new players) chaotic split?
---
Isn't there less balls than the limit, in a map ? I remember farming unbound magic in bloodstone fen back in the days, and using several (3?) characters to farm the biggest "lines" of magic before they disappeared.
---
According to wiki
---
&gt;  There is a limit of 500 orbs per account per day.
---
So unless there are more than 500 in a single map, it may be doable.
---
i'm currently trying to get the crossair leggings from the "all or nothing" meta event
---
Ususlly I limit myself to fractal dailies not because that's all I want to do, but because of how much time it burns and the other content I want to knock out.  I genuinely do enjoy Fractals and Dungeons more than other content, and I do sometimes run additional runs just for fun.
---
It's a twitch chat emote. Pog is just the excited looking mouth of PogChamp, an excited looking Asian guy.

Just an attempt at a "furry" pinup that has very little to do with the character and traced to top it all off. (Considering how badly you don't understand way more basic things than faces I'm gonna take the liberty and assume you traced the models ;))  
---
Consider studying so you don't need to trace and thus limiting your ideas, like this one. Would have turned out way better if you didn't have to rely on in-game models to draw.
---
Wtf does this even mean?
---
What a time to be alive, GW2 is such a great game!
---
Ditch the minstrels for wvw, the healing is really lackluster compared to scrappers and tempests. https://youtu.be/yd1o8FAWoQ8

Start at 19:20 to see the alternative =D
---
Welp, if I ever get back into PvP again I know what I'm saying in response to people who get salty with me =P
---
It likely depends on the map. Some maps have way more orbs than others.
---
Trying to get all the orbs in a map like Jahai would be kind of insane.
---
Just above you told me Anet doesn't ban for RMT.  But look at the actual support emails they sent:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9d7orp/how_to_get_someone_banned_for_less_than_3/e5fujwa?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x

No.

Euhhh, I'm all for banter/bm (referring to dropping siege on corpses) but don't think I would promote griefing.
---
Okay I'll be honest... I'd be cool with that ha seems like the return command doesn't always work
---
I've never really played GW2 (though I bought it at release). Currently my main and only game is WoW. I'm playing mostly for the story and to explore solo, I'm not really interested in grouped content (anymore). WoW is pretty good in this regard, but lately they starting to adding dungeons and raids into the main storyline which is cannot be completed without them. It not a huge problem, because of LFD/LFR but yesterday I was wiping for hours on a boss (yes, in LFR) and it's just annoying when you have limited gametime. How about GW2 in this regard? If you interested in story / lore content and not about gear and upgrades how well you can do with solo only?
---
Also what is the current payment model for GW2? I'm totally fine with paying the amount I pay for WoW (monthly sub + expansion every 2 years). With that amount of money can I unlock everything? (again, I'm not really interested in vanity and power upgrades, only if they are necessary for checking new content).
---
I wish i had infinite money so i could give you 5 bucks for a lukewarm coffee.
---
I need to know everything about 10. Right now. 😅
---
I've always dyed/stylized my armor after the backpacks.
---
- PvP
---
- LW Season 2 to unlock Luminescent skins
---
- Crucible Of Eternity for Golemancer runes
---
- Grabbing expansion hero points for my Charrdian
---
Don't have a ton of time though, so progress is fairly slow.

Since i know that the OP will not respond well to criticism to this build, i will instead adress it to anyone who is viewing this and is thinking: hmm, this might work!
---
It doesnt.
---
First, letting your firebrands deal dps, in whatever form, is a terrible idea. Firebrands can pump out amazing amounts of support and need to focus on doing that. Having them deal dps takes away from their support role and that is just not worth it in any scenario. You can see in his gameplay that on critical moments a firebrand needs to choose between support (F2 and 3) or dps (F1) and by not providing support, the rest of the group will suffer.
---
Secondly, the dps component of this build is currently countered completely by support scrapper. This build puts out damage mainly in the form of burn stacks, the power component is negligible. Support scrapper is able to cleanse the majority of this builds damage, and not only that, all the burn stacks are converted to aegis, which means this build helps the enemy to potentially *mitigate* more damage than what it is capable to put out.
---
Don't put your firebrands on dps, it's pointless. dedicated dps classes that can focus all their attention on killing enemies are far superior, and i'm not talking maybe 10% more effectiveness, its easily 10 times more efficient than whatever this is.
---
I'm so glad I'm not the only person who thought of the mario leaping off of yoshi connection.
---
They need to do something with warhorn and move the warhorn boosting trait out of discipline then otherwise you'll get tactics discipline which doesn't have too much going for it in either direction since the core warrior's skills aren't appropriate for support or healing or rezzing without being on long cooldowns (battle standard) and changing those traits don't make a new elite spec suddenly exist.

The primary reason my characters often don't wear backpacks is because of how few of them match the rest of their look.

Story is pretty well separated into solo story, several raid storylines that are self-contained (occasionally influencing the main plot but not crucial to it), and occasional wholly isolated small-group storylines. There are a small number of 5-man story dungeons with the original game release but they're very easy with random PUGs.
---
There is a very limited gear treadmill that's entirely accessible via solo play.
---
Payment model is buy-to-play with microtransactions. You'll have to buy two expansions (price variable depending on sales, around 80USD full price but almost always cheaper) plus about 3 seasons of "living story" content (smaller episodic releases that are free if you play during their release window) which will run you probably 15-20, I'd have to check the bundle prices.
---
Yeah I remember that.  But I think there was also an update that made it possible.  I'm pretty sure I jumped on a map the day after the update and grabbed it (because obviously a few weeks later there would be very few ppl trying).
---
Desert borderland has a warg vet as well, near the supply camp on the southern border.
---
Thx will use this for open world now!
---
Though for the home instance, I am thinking of having a firebrand gatherer
---
Burning variant guards are good at stomping pugs but only that honestly. Those arcdps burning numbers from reflect are typical. 
---
Overall your utility is basically in brawl out and pewpew fights with 50 man in all party pug squads where you are self sufficient in one sense but contribute nothing. Pre-death Mag players used to run this sort of build to kill bad blobs individually.
---
Don't bring this stuff if your role is support. Other guard dps variants are playable in organized fights but require more specialized tuning and a team built around them. For the average player/ group, for optimal gameplay highly recommend running a traditional dps, if you are doing 5 man party setups.

GW2 is still buy to play meaning there is no subscription. Since the start of the game the base game is now free to play (since you own the base game you don't have the free to play restrictions) and there have been 2 expansions released (each $30 or [bundled together for less](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911)). 
---
As for playing the story everything can be done solo just fine. There are some side stories that tie into the main persona story in the dungeons but they aren't needed for the story. Some dungeons can be soloed though it can be very difficult, usually they are easy when done with the recommended 5 players. Fractals (the real end game 5 man content) has it's own side story in scaling difficulty zones and repeats the same levels through 4 tiers. If all you care about there is the story then doing tier 1 is very easy but again usually wants 5 players (easy to get with LFG). Raids (10 man) have story in them as well but again it is more side story stuff not needed for the main plot.
---
The main story is broken down into:
---
**Personal story**: This is the story missions you'll do as you level, you get access to a new chunk of them every 10 levels from 1-80. Your race and starting choices affect the beginning of the story but all lines start to converge.
---
**Season 1**: This was in the form of changes to the maps and can not be replayed. I have a [quick summery here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Story_Recap), there is a [3hr "recap" video here](https://youtu.be/d17gwV4vXOg), and the wiki has [detailed story summaries here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Story_summary).
---
**Season 2**: You can buy [the complete pack](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_2_Complete_Pack) for 1280 gems ($16 or in game gold converted to gems, 303g right now) in game. The pack adds 8 story chapters and a lot of story content but not much else. I enjoyed going through it all myself.
---
**Heart of Thorns**: The first expansion has 4 acts each with multiple long story chapters and gives access to 4 large new maps as well as many other features.
---
**Season 3**: Like season 2 [can be purchased for 960 gems](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_3_Complete_Pack) ($12 or again gold, 227g right now). Also adds 6 new zones to explore.
---
**Path of Fire**: Second expansion, adds 3 acts with many chapters each as well as 5 new large zones to explore.
---
**Season 4**: Current living world season, we are on episode 5/6 right now with 6 coming out soon (I expect it next month on the 21st). If you log in now you get the current episode unlocked for free forever (still requires PoF to play though). Will have 6 new zones and a complete pack once the last episode comes out (you'll get a discount for owning episodes though I expect the base price to be 960 gems again).
---
The upcoming release plan is to go into season 5 next with a new episode released every 2-3 months for free if you log in. If you continue to play you won't need to pay any more for story content until the next expansion (at least 12-18 months out).
---
Don't the sic em build pose a threat if they land the cc and the 2 lb skill? Your build is full berserker, so I assume (I'm ignorant on warrior) it is rather squishy.
---
The point is to call out blatant powercreeping and questionable balance decisions quickly so they are rectified and don't become a norm.
---
Also harrier etc.?
---
Come to mag, we love teaching players how to play wvw competitively on all classes.
---
That's pretty much it.  If you want "any stat" then a combo of banners achievs, LS3, and WvW I guess is the way to go.
---
Just played for the first time yesterday. Really enjoying this game. I plan on buying the expansions. Is it worth buying them early as a new player?
---
my guardian, but i went for purple details on the armor instead of blue because i thought it looked better, and the back piece looks purplish from different angels.

That’s fair.  We’ve seen a fair share of players on this sub in the past who lost months/years of progress because of buying keys from g2a &amp; kinguin for expansions.  It’s the reason the auto moderator responds to threads asking about them when they do show up.
---
If you have proper balancing then the distinction between meta and non meta is reasonably small.
---
By pretending efficiency and difficulty are irrelevant as players can always gimp themselves, the difference between both ends grows larger. 
---
You cant go around pretending difficulty and balance are irrelevant, which is exactly what a large group on this sub often does.
---
And then those players REEEEE when other people do care about performance, and treat them as negligible as a result. Yet their contribution is negligible.
---
It's perfectly fine for you not to care about metas and balance. But dont expect others to neglect it too. And if anets balance team ignores it, those who care about balance least suffer the most. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.
---
Its entertaining to see the community tell everyone how meta should be irrelevant, yet balance issues and powercreep only make the difference between meta and meme builds bigger.
---

---
the problem is that people who tend to like warriors also tend to like the playstyle it (should) offer. when you think warrior, you don't think hybrid support with mediocre dps, you think just damage or tank, maybe a bit of both, but tank is irrelevant in this game so mainly damage. it just goes against the theme of the class, people don't want warrior to be able to do everything, they just want to be able to have a viable (for meta) dps option that will allow them to join pugs without getting kicked for not bringing banners.
---
For harrier I believe you need banners or LS4.
---
Improving is fine. Blatant powercreep is not. 
---
Yet blatant powercreep is the norm for gw2.
---
Since you can't restart it, as a workaround, why not bring another character through the first instance (watching the cutscenes), then continue the story with your main?
---
Bonus: Your alt now has access to these S3 maps as well and can help with per-character farms in future!
---
[y-you mean you don't stupidiously match every backpiece to all your characters outfits already?](https://imgur.com/a/MkXt0OY)
---
Tell you what: Go troll someone else. Blocked.
---
It was "new" on January, its almost May xD
---
While it's no down state event in wvw, i'm blessing every single enemy of mine with a cancer bullet of my precious burst deadeye. I love it as much as i hate myself. :\^)
---
As others have mentioned, the easiest way is definitely LWS3 stuff. Particularly winter berries. With 8 characters, you can easily get enough winter berries in 1 day for a backpack. With 4 characters it'll take 2 days, with 2 characters 4 days, etc. Either way, it's not too bad.
---
However, I would like to suggest an alternative if you're looking to gear a Power class. If you have max crafting, crafting the exotic &lt;&lt;insert craft here&gt;&gt; backpiece is really cheap. It's a level 78 backpiece, you throw a relevant crystal on it, it lets you select Berserker stats, it's got a slot for an infusion (so you can put agony resist on it), and it's account bound. It's a pretty good cheap alternative to tide you over until you can get an ascended one.
---
Tanking is almost nonexistent in GW2. There are some raid bosses that have a tank mechanic where they will follow the player with the highest toughness. When learning how to tank those bosses, many players will go up to 2K+ toughness just to make it easier. However, ultimately, there are enough blocks/evades available that every boss can pretty easily be tanked with like 1200-1300 toughness, so very little "tank" stats. Outside of raids, tanking is nonexistent. 
---
For T4s and raids, healing is pretty crucial, at the start. Again, as you get better and better at the game, it becomes less crucial. The best T4 parties don't use a healer, and the best raid parties only use 1. Maybe there're even raid parties that use none and I'm just ignorant to them. 
---
That only applies to like the top 0.1% of players though. By and large, healers are necessary in T4s and Raids. Druid is good in raids, and it's passable in fractals. Right now heal firebrand/heal rev is a good combo for fractals and can be used for raids. Healing Tempest is also an option, though it falls behind the others in terms of utility. Heal Scourge is...ok, if you're good at it. Most people who play it are not.
---
I recommend checking Snow Crows website (I'd link it but I'm at work and cannot) for raid builds, and Discretize [dT]'s website for fractal builds. They'll both have the stats and such that you need for any build, healing and tanking included. 
---
Snow Crows will also go into great detail for every raid encounter, even for a specific class. There's a lot to be learned there.
---
dT also goes into the same level of detail for fractals.
---
Those two websites honestly can teach you pretty much everything you need to know : )
---
Who are you calling bad?
---
All in all i feel as though the moment you start running two healers all arguments for running fb/ren over chrono druid become void, and this is coming from someone who's had her druid gear scattered around for months.
---
Again, I welcome healing in fb/ren compositions but the reliance on outhealing in "low kp groups" feels wrong to me.
---
Recently in my guild we got two newer players their first 99cm kill, and we did it without a healer.
---
Harrier or minstrel is great on both firebrand and renegade, so a player wanting to play support on either build can't go wrong with one such set.
---
If you plan to play together with the other half of the duo however, and both of you are healing, you're simply shooting yourself in the foot.
---
Thanks! Really glad you liked it!
---
I'm stating mixing zerk and minstrel is bad from an optimizations point of view.
---
Like most of your ideas and builds, anyone with half a brain can see they're terrible even for their purpose. Stats are distributed awfully. Generally terrible choices for gear, and so on. 
---
A mix of minstrel zerk has bad power scaling, due to minstrel pieces. If you want the power scaling anyways you're better off with mixes of stats allowing you to allocate more power and less fero. 
---
I dont expect you to understand this. After all you stated a build cant be bad if it's fun. For you a build is good if you find it fun mashing your buttons.
---
However i don't want new players who want advise thinking any of your builds are half decent.
---
You talk about meta "slaves" but literally every build you make tells anyone who can do basics of optimizations that you cannot. Meta builds exist for players like you who genuinely cannot grasp how to optimize a setup.
---
As irony wants it, desperately hating the meta hasn't actually made you capable of making functional builds.
---
I'm expecting the release on the 21st. We do know that raid wing 7 is in the works but there hasn't been confirmation on when it will release (though it's supposed to be close to done). You can read the [what's to come post here](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/) which mentions: 
---
&gt; We’re currently adding more polish to the final encounter in the next raid, which continues the story of Qadim and will get its own release after Episode 6. We’re utilizing one of the new team’s efforts to build some additional small-scale open world content so all of our players will have something to celebrate with the release of the raid.
---
"Ive mastered and practice a game for 7 years and now its too easy" lol
---
I don't know when the Episode will Drop. But i can say
---
you a new Raid Wing will drop, some weeks after the ep6
---
All the good players from tc went to maguuma, and there are several active guilds here now. Slide into my dms if you wanna know more.
---
Why...
---
Does anyone have a good Fractals only Healing Firebrand build? I am putting one together for CMs. I have already checked:  
---
* **Discretize** - no healbrand build, only quickbrand build
---
* **Snowcrows** - has a [Raid healbrand build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/heal/), not sure if it's applicable for Fractals
---
* **Metabattle** - has a [Raid/Fractals healbrand build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Firebrand_-_Support_Healer), but it doesn't seem specific for Fractals either. 
---
Which of the 2 do I use? Or does anyone have a better alternative to either of these? Gearing isn't really an issue for me.
---
We've had considerable powercreep from hot and pof. 
---
Can you remind me of a single time content itself was made more difficult? Cause I've got a small list of occurrences where content was made easier.
---
Turns out its OK if things get repeatedly easier over time. Then we can all pretend we improved, I guess.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_back_item
---
Scroll down to "Vendors" and collect the appropriate currency.
---
Fastest is Winterberries in Bitterfrost Frontier.
---
Best is Blood Rubies in Bloodstone Fen because you can spend 100 Unbound Magic to reset the backpack and select new stats whenever you want.
---
None of those will get you PoF stats though.
---
Join the maguuma server, play wvw, step 3:????, step 4 profit!
---
&gt; making her vulnerable
---
The word "vulnerable" has a defined meaning in GW2. It doesn't apply to Blighted Eir.
---
50-90 boonrips through interrupts is complete bullshit and you know it. Unless you are steamrolling enemy group, sure, that might be possible.
---
Raiding almost every day
---
Nothing for roaming but expandas runs a good discord for zerg meta discussions.
---
It's well researched on SFR. Rumour has it they only group up while waiting for Henry to respawn, so they can go back to pve after their dailies.
---
Well it's useful, but incredibly mind numbing and subpar imo. 
---
You don't need anything in particular to win against trash and against good groups you don't do all that much apart from like 2 cc skills, cus pugs never melee anyway.
---
I use Harrier's gear + diviner/harrier jewellery swapping from some DPS to full heals depending on the group and instabilities. Weapons Magi staff, which I camp when healing and harrier/zerker dual sword, which I also camp but when dpsing. I swap from Jalis/invocation to Ventari/Salvation. 
---
Maybe not ideal but handy enough to PUG everything smoothly.
---
That being said, I also have a firebrand, and I agree with other comments, harrier/monk FB heals a lot and could carry almost any group through any content. I personally enjoy them both a lot, way better than my chrono or druid.
---
Very friendly join the maguuma server if you like wvw and pvp
---
Just to add onto what /u/dak393 is saying, the highest discounts on the expansions is 50% off, so if you can get anything around 40% off, from either an approved retailer or Arenanet, it's pretty good already.
---
Whats up with those daily questions about sales?
---
If you max out your daily orb cap on 30 characters you get a hidden achievement called 'no life'.
---
And how many false?
---
The only people who want down state are the players dying frequently. Fact of the matter is if you roam entering down state is already death. It serves no purpose. In zergs a downstate is a target and will likely die anyway unless someone is specifically a revive bot, the downstate will likely still die anyway because commanders focus downs. A down state is already certain death unless you are downing in a group that has the advantage....in which case you should not be going down in the first place. Down state favors the stronger side and it makes no sense.
---
I only got 2 alts i made for crafting but otherwise i dont use them at all.
---
Imagine being retarded enough to have a guardian flair and call anything in this game braindead. Tri kit vanilla engi was far from braindead but I gsuesntee you never played it enough to find that out.
---
I will continue to call people out who bullshit numbers.
---
Because it doesn't kill anything. It'll take a while to kill but if you die to scrapper you may be handicapped.
---
For me as an Egyptian 50$ is just too much and i already reached lvl 80 40-50 days ago
---
By that definition, what can even be a deus ex machina in Guild Wars. It's a fantasy world with catpeople and dragons, even if Aurene would magically be alive again in the next episode just like Kenny comes back every time he was killed, without any explanation or mention whatsoever it still would hardly be describable as deus ex machina, besides they could probably still come back to it and explain it at a later date.
---
The commander death was another one of those magical things that didn't really make sense, doesn't it? Oh everyone else is dead and for good but because we are the hero we are allowed to bend the rules somehow by collecting life force of others to go back to the world of the living. Mh. Yes, totally. Sure it makes sense.. somehow but its a weak explanation for basically retcon'ing the commanders death. I would have really wished they would have gone longer with this "you are dead" thing, for multiple episodes not just a single small mission in which you have to smack a few baddies and return back to life and if we can come back like this, why can't a dragon magically come back. 
---
I'm really curious to see how they gonna fix this "beautiful" mess because lets be honest, putting the world in real danger and basically breaking the game like this is a genius move... just not for a game that is supposed to continue running, this would be the perfect end for when GW2 would have closed down, now they just drove themselves into a corner with no exit.
---
I have done 4 hearts with my 8 characters in sandswept isles a month ago still haven't ran out of avocado smoothies and it took me like 3-4 hours.
---
If some people do not know the character, it is Taskmaster. This cosplay is based on his [Avengers World](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiNwcyszvXhAhUEv7wKHUcnAEYQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmarvelheroes.info%2Fitem%2F2019%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw3VK9bXHyUmmDumDHG8aHA_&amp;ust=1556637934650059) costume.

This is LS4, my comment was more about LS3, I forgot to write it :(
---
According to wiki, for LS4 orbs :
---
&gt; a total daily account limit of 250 orbs
---
Is Henry an adorable server wide name for the harpy, or did your phone autocorrect it?
---
I am not sure if i know what "gimping" means since I am not a nativ but if it means what i think, than things like not running meta comps is not rly gimping yourselfe. Stuff like doing it without gear, well yes thats gimping yourselfe. Some of my ideas are kinda hardcore I admit it, but some others are just normal ways to spice things up. I did many low mans and non meta runs myslefe. Ifs fun. 
---
Also you have to admit that there will always be player that think that content is too easy. I know ppl who did Mai Trin solo without armor (years back when it was the hardest frac way before fracs where reworked). The person I am thinking about also said the game was too easy and i agreed with him. After doing stuff like the shit he did you can say its to easy. But OP did Content with the most Meta setup with rly exp players and the best gear possible. If someone like him complains about stuff being too easy its kinda laughable from my perspective. 
---
There are balance problems i admit that. I dont even say the Meta is fun atm. But makeing a game challanging is something we can do without anet i think. At least a bit. (would be nice if we got some nice balancing somewhen, though)
---
And if you think that the Endgame is easy it just shows that you are a good player. You invested a lot of time in practice and are now able to do content smoothly, that many others will never be able to do cause its way to difficult for them.
---
Come to mag several early to late na guilds have made it their new home and love to teach and show our passion for wvw to new and returning players
---
[IF only there would be an already super in depth guide to firebrand in wvw somewhere on a website!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/512402715603632131/553285555841007627/screencapture-127-0-0-1-5500-builds-guardian-html-2019-03-07-16_18_52.png)
---
Lets see.. I went in on my engi to start doing warclaw progress.. stepped outside our main keep, a warrior dropped on me, did his crazy spin and I was dead. 14k hp, 1500 toughness.. dead by 1 ability. :thinking:
---
&gt; Innocent till proven guilty.
---
I agree but OP has been proven guilty by Anet, otherwise they wouldnt have been banned in the first place.
---
&gt; Doesn't cost anyone anything to give correct advice based on what information is given to us.
---
How do you give correct advice when the information given is incorrect on purpose?
---
&gt; We can do and should do nothing more than give correct advice as that is what OP is asking for and going further out of your way to help should be done of your own good will as that is NOT what is being asked here.
---
That argument swings both ways, if they want correct advice, they should give the correct information and not lie or leave out relevant information on purpose to help their case. And if all of us should give advice to OP, where is yours in this thread? I dont see it.
---
&gt; And again, they are asking us to help THEM do something about it not asking us to do something about it OURSELVES. Quit trying to stretch it any other way, everyone else in this post understands this. Of course if people do want to go out of their way to help further then again that's their choice and a completely different matter.
---
Thats not all OP he has done. They also claimed that Anet banned them without researching their account just based on some suspicious people reporting them a billion times.
---
They just came here to cause drama and QQ.
---
Sometimes the green circles in deimos or sabetha’s arrow showing where fire wall will spawn doesn’t show up for me.

[DLGamer](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/search?keywords=guild+wars+2) consistently has the lowest prices out of the official retailers, although other sites will occasionally have better sales.  Use a price tracking site like [isthereanydeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/) to alert you if there is a sale at any of them.
---
Keep an eye out when the next episode launches (probably before the end of May), as ArenaNet sometimes offers discount codes during those windows.  Or they will likely offer a discount during the 7-year anniversary (August).
---
DO NOT BUY FROM KEYSELLERS LIKE G2A, CDKEYS, ETC.  There is a chance your account will be terminated if you buy from them.

World completion and WvW for my first legendary.

And slowly working through LS3.

&gt;	Getting a few key drops from completion too, and I’ve manager to grab some nice skins with them.
---
I must just be cursed. In the past 6 months I've done 3 map completions...and between 3 characters, I've received maybe 12 keys total, and 3 decent skins, and other than that the best drop from a key chest has been a Tyrian exchange voucher.

On my latest alt, I just finished my fifth consecutive zone without a key.

Fractal CM's, T4's and recommendeds. Crazy gold, and fun with a partial static. Get voluntold for some 42 farming from time to time 'cause I usually run healybrand.
---
&gt;	I don’t have the high energy this game demands. 
---
Have you looked into quilting?
---
Ok but this question gets asked every day.
---
I'm trying to understand WvW because I find it very enjoyable. I remember a noob friendly WvW guide post but I can't seem to find it.   This guide was posted few days after the warclaw mount got released. 
---
Anybody has that guide? OR another noob friendly guide to WvW?
---
And here you can see another druid/chrono main mad their class is not on the spotlight anymore.
---
If MI can't save you but IoL can you're in the wrong spot
---
2 confirmed false ones that you know of.  I'm not going around saying its greater than 1% or less than 1%.  I'm not the one making up numbers based on my gut feelings.  In fact, if you read my very first comment, '  It might be accurate, it might not. ', I think you will see that.

Daily Rountine: Dailys, LS4 Map Dailys, WvW Dailys if possible.

3 Days a week I am raiding. Any other day I do what comes to my mind.

Currently working on my first raid legy armor (heavy) while getting stuff for two legys (trinkets) that may hit with LS4 finale and raid wing 7.

If I read all that, I think I burn too much time in this game 🤔
---
Zerk is fun spin to win and instagib nerds in wvw
---
Henry is the wurm
---
Awesome! Thanks for the website :) I appreciate it
---
Been with GW2 since launch. One of the best games out there, with the best player base.
---
Spirits don't pulse boons anymore. They only give boons on active skill use.
---
It's called a Quad burn because there are 4 Chak Gerents for each of the 4 lanes/squads to contend with. When all 4 Chak Gerents are killed within the first burn phase (Under 3 minutes) its' called a Quad 1-burn.

Dungeons or newbie raid pugs
---
It's a secret ploy to sell more crystal wing gliders! /s
---
It's not like this vista was particularly hard to get to begin with
---
It doesn't have Bane Signet and Perfect Inscriptions, is that wise?
---
Iol gives 5 seconds of iframes can be mimic'd and split and pick up multiple players. Mi cant fully negate a good bomb but iol can.
---
*unintended fantastic feature*
---
And if new content gets progressively harder people get upset too. Qadim and dhuum were difficult, lets not pretend the first bosses of W5 or W6 are particularly hard. 
---
New CMs? Not seen in a rather long time. 
---
Content being nerfed to be more "accessible"? Frequent enough.
---
Powercreep? Every single expansion and weapon rework. 
---
I'd say over time things get easier and easier, and yet the playerbase keeps demanding MORE EASY MORE LOOT LESS EFFORT AND WHY DO PEOPLE ASK FOR META ITS EASY ANYWAYS. Yet groups disband faster than ever if the loot isn't effortless. 
---
Fun game gameplay, great interactions.
---
Dwayna: Heeey... you?
---
I do hope you commit to the rp  and turn your monitor off when playing him.

Just like my favourite bear, Baloo. https://youtu.be/TpetAXm0hz4
---
Your above post gave me cancer, log into the game and adapt instead of crying about soi nerf.
---
Right now I'm farming to finish off the Keepsake weapon set while they're cheap. After that, I'm going to probably work towards my wvw legendary armor.
---
For me just grinding daily Hot metas and istan for gold until episode 6 comes out
---
also saw teapot that teapot has released his dhum guide today, but then i woke up
---
I remember when people complained about the TD meta because it was genuinely hard as balls, not because it took too much time for the loot to pop.
---
Banners aren't affected by boon duration, so getting non-berserker gear would just be a waste
---
To talk about a pet peeve of mine so maybe things smooth up a bit for a ton of people. But getting told what to do instead is cool, too.
---
My pleasure:-P
---
Honestly I got nothing now... I am tired of doing the same dailies, WvW, fractals and world train bosses. I also don't have time to invest in raiding due to work and school. So I just log in and just do random stuff after that I log off. I don't see myself active much until the next living world episode but I don't know beyond that If I can wait several months for season 5 episodes. The game has been stale for me for a while but I still log in for the nostalgia.
---
As usual, crucial information (like boonripping) is missing. As usual, I feel obligated to mention you should fix the laundry list of issues with your older guides, starting with the tanking Desmina in the middle meme. As usual, you will ignore any critical feedback, no matter how constructive.
---
I have been in any aspect of this game including old teamarena top100 and Pre-HOT GVG Scene.
---
I go through all the changes, every time since well, i don't remember when was last time i didn't try to come up with a build for mesmer. Anyway, i just can't find the usability you claim mesmers have. 
---
There's CC, illusion of life, null field and veil... Anything i'm missing? Not really.
---
Chrono and dps main, but assuming seems to be a natural behaviour nowadays.
---
Well it might seem (to you) as an order, but i was only giving you options. No one in the sub will know who to give 5 dollars to, imo it's too low anyway.
---
No worries. Torment is no mechanic :)
---
I am saying that this new meta comp with its incredible burst potential made it too easy.
---
You monkeyshinez or something?
---
I would never join such a group. If i want to waste my time, i go sth else.

If you dont understand why iol is the most broken util in large scale pvp the lol m8
---
I am not a troll and im dead serious.
---
Well, it's never about ignoring feedback, but I simply can't edit/replace already uploaded video, like some text guide, I thought it's obvious. I may do updated guides in the future who know:-)
---
Lmbo, you must lack comprehension skills. The original comment said he ISN'T familiar with the game and he doesn't get the comic, and i countered and said i am familiar with the game and don't grasp the comics either i hope you can understand now that i have broken it down for you, man tits..
---
Why? Because randoms don't expect to get rezzed and almost always just down the moment distortion ends...
---
When does the outfit actually show up? If ever?
---
&gt; you know, use a human. If you're going to use a Sylvari form, then...
---
...you mean, *that* sylvari "form" that the Pale Tree [canonically explicitly based off of humans](https://web.archive.org/web/20120201114735/http://www.talktyria.net/2011/08/11/sylvari-lore-interview-with-ree-soesbee-kristen-perry/),
---
&gt; because the race tightly relates to the essence of human due to the Pale Tree’s influences from Ronan, the overall form has a human silhouette.
---
, down to the external reproductive organs?
---
Dm me if you decide to come to mag I'll link you the necessary discords for organized team play.
---
So whats the fix? Overhaul base Warriors abilities to do more damage and be more impactful? And move banners to a new support oriented Warrior specialization?
---
Right, they're a staple for their stab, quickness, retal, and aegis. This provides all of those at the same level as minstrels, but puts out 3x the damage minstrels does healing. It makes no sense from a comp standpoint to have a class that's bad at healing compared to scrappers and tempests run healing gear when you could instead be top 5 damage and lose none of the utility.
---
That moment when you realize you should follow your own advice......lol
---
Relax
---
brought to you by the committee for freshwater pearls?
---
Arent you that guy that leaked legendary armor?
---
why recs? I always find it a waste of time. I love doing t4s tho, I intend to learn CMs next month, Last time I've played there were no cms
---
Similar to how the Metabattle build has variants, the SC build has variant traits and skills in their [guide on a separate page.](https://snowcrows.com/raids/guides/guardian/firebrand/heal/) 
---
Radiance instead of Virtues for Perfect Inscriptions/Bane Signet is one of the variants listed - similarly, utilities are often situational based on what you need at the time.
---
Same healing when missing at least 20 to 50 % of the flat healing increase from runes and food and trait lines... I strongly doubt that. That is basically impossible. That is so very much impossible that I... 
---
Look dude. I have tried everything. Like literally everything. This is a fun build for stomping noobs. This can't be meta and never will be.
---
The metabattle version is quite good, I would roll with virtues though, I just prefer more healing output, since dead people deal no damage, full Minstrel and staff, great burst heal, it allows me to heal pugs through most encounters, a T3 Mai Trin can be facetanked, T4 fractals even with bad mods are usually very doable. Also heal carrying is fun.
---
Aren't you the guy who always ask?:-)
---
Pretty much only raids if I have the time to play. Since I have very limited time, might as well play the best content with that time!
---
Awesome ty. He didn't mention Swampland?
---
Limit is 69 character slots, unless you had 69 before HoT/PoF then you could go up to 72 with the free character slot ArenaNet gave you.
---
I have nine (one of each class).  The game is very alt-friendly and I would really encourage it.  Playing a tanky warrior -vs- a slippery thief -vs- a support/healing elementalist adds a lot of variety to the game and will allow you to enjoy the content longer.
---
Good old times... long forgotten
---
I asked about swampland and he clarified there is some use for boonstrip.
---
no?
---
[Truffle Steak](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Plate_of_Truffle_Steak) is +70 precision while [Butternut Squash soup](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bowl_of_Sweet_and_Spicy_Butternut_Squash_Soup) is +70 ferocity.
---
Neat. Thanks!
---
&gt;I have a lot of random items that seem useful so I haven't used them yet (I think most are from the birthday rewards since my characters are old). As a newer player, what should I be doing with Laurels (15ish), Black Lion Statuettes (\~10), Black Lion Chests (30+), Mystic Coin (70), Mystic Forge Stones (15).
---
* Laurels are often used for quick gold (buying Medium or Heavy Crafting Bags from the Laurel Vendor in major cities; each Laurel is worth approximately 76s), or buying Ascended trinkets (from the same vendor). Since Laurels do not take up inventory space, save them for now.
---
* Black Lion Statuettes can be used to purchase boosters (XP, Magic Find, Karma) or items that were exclusive drops from the Black Lion Chests. For now, I recommend holding on to them unless there's something you'd really like to have now. Note that their selection changes every 2 months or so.
---
* Black Lion Chests offer mostly exclusive cosmetic items, and require Black Lion Keys to be opened. I will never recommend buying Black Lion Keys with real money; Keys can be obtained in-game through specific personal story quests, and map completion (around 1/4 chance).
---
* Mystic Forge Stones are most often used to make Mystic Salvage Kits (by combining 3 Mystic Forge Stones, and one of each Fine, Journeyman, and Master Salvage Kit at the Mystic Forge). Mystic Salvage Kits have 250 uses, and are best used to salvage Rare (yellow) items. 
---
&gt;What crafting options should I be working on? I'm currently a chef and a tailor. I haven't seen too much info on what is useful endgame. 
---
While we wait for word on the future update to cooking, I usually recommend less established players to get one armor crafting (tailor, leatherworking, armorsmith) and one weapon crafting (weaponsmith, huntsman, artificer). This then allows them to craft high level Inscriptions and Insignias that will be useful towards the late game.
---
&gt;I have 70 gold and will have \~3000 Gems or so from the pack. Aside from spending stuff on cosmetics, are there any items worth purchasing from the market or gems that are good for game/character progression?
---
Bank slots, 1-5 Shared Inventory Slots, a Copper-Fed Salvage-o-Matic, and a set of infinite gathering tools are my recommendations. These are simply great conveniences to have.
---
So this is the thing. I been playing gw2 for almost 2 and a half months now, i been doing necro, scourge to be precise, and i lose my head whener i see a "twilight" lengendary, and i want it fairly much, the thing is this game has so many content, i love pvp ammong other stuff, so i wanted to know if there is an updated guide on how can i start to build this sword, i have been saving stuff like laurels, karma, but i do not really know what else i should be saving, what i shall be spending, what content i should be doing to aim for this goal, easiest way to get there, i know it will take gold and well it will eventually come, but what else would you advice on this journey?
---
i'm from germany. my ping is ok ~17 - 50ms
---
What season 1 references?
---
Thanks for the response. Is the "unbreakable gathering tools" set good enough to gather most items?
---
5 actively:
---
Druid for CM fractals and raiding main;
---
Warrior for CM fractals (occasionally) and HoT meta farming;
---
Dragonhunter for pDPS in raids and LW map farming;
---
Mirage for cDPS in raids (and will start to build as chrono for raids);
---
Tempest for WvW.
---
Thanks for all the information! That helps quite a bit
---
How much I need? I'm pretty casual and I'm only level 40.
---
&gt; SSC
---
You can't be more south than south.
---
The only time I've seen that is when arriving late for a fight and the AoEs were already there before I arrived.
---
It goes on sale a couple of times a year from official channels.
---
- PvPing while the season is active, working towards legendary armor 4/6, and backpack (2 more wins as Warrior til achieved).
---
- Doing Colossus II collection. Definitely not just for the Ooze Terrarium gizmo. Definitely.
---
- Suffering through building the Druid Stone thing. just 2 more weeks.  (_._)
---
- Finishing a couple one-off collection achievements; currently a couple specialization focused ones.
---
I think you’re missing the point of the thread then. I understand it’s strong. That’s the point. I feel like other trait lines offer decent things, but the way it’s situated is every line is either meh or incredible. I want every line to be good and there is actually a trade off. Because as it stands, if you want to use an elite spec, you only have one other option for a trait line as Trickery is always taken and it just limits the things you can do with your builds.
---
Dang that's some fast achievement! How many matches you play per day?
---
Running in circles inside the LA Aerodome or running in circles around the Silverwastes. Only one of them is me being productive.
---
Good monkey
---
* Taimi mentions her illness again at the end of episode 4. In season 1 when you talk to her she explains why she can't walk long distances.
---
* Rox tells bottica she's a gladium. In season 1 when Rox is introduced she tries to get into Rytlock's warband to avoid being a gladium.
---
* During the dredge meta event in Thunderhead Peaks Rox mentions she was a miner. In season 1 this is how Rox became a gladium, she lost her entire warband in a mining incident.
---
* Bait-o-Tron in Jahai Bluffs is the Hero-tron golem in LA. This golem was a character in season 1 getting many names throughout the season, in the finale he helps save LA from Scarlet and gets the name Hero-Tron.
---
* In Jahai Bluffs there is a Scarlet Hallucination that starts the adventure "run around for no reason". Scarlet Briar was the main villain in Season 1.
---
* In the thunderhead peak defense meta Canach plants explosives and "had a menacing low-volume chuckle". Bit of a stretch but Canach was a minor bad guy in Season 1 that tried to blow up some Consortium contracts.
---
It's definitely a mechanic to show the progress of heating to the player, enemies and allies alike, but I've seen no specific lore explanation.
---
If I had to guess a lore explanation, my guess would be that the photon forge extends some sort of rig around the holosmith to have more surface that will emit light to produce the holographic constructs, so their whole body becomes kind of like a portable holo-emitter.  
---
If you are acquainted with Holodeck from Star Trek:TNG and the portable holo-emitter from ST:Voyager, it would be like having the portable emitter create a holographic holodeck inside out around a person, then have the walls of the holographic holodeck around that person produce weapons in the hands of that person.  
---
Since it's not meant to damage the enemy, but produce other effects, it doesn't need to use the sunlight energy, so it has a more generic holographic blue color. 
---
Then it gets redder and redder as it accumulates excess heat from using the Holoforge skills, that could be on purpose so the engineer is aware of the danger, or a side-effect of the heat affecting the base blue color.
---
I think it's a little bit more than that, i think they hate banners because its unintuitive, passive gameplay. You toss a couple flags on the ground, and now everybody does more damage. I mean okay, thats great from a gameplay perspective, but what about satisfaction? A good example of this is the recent Berserker changes, using the Greatsword F1 in Berserk mode actually feels good to use.
---
Quite likely. An exact determination would require much more effort than I'm willing to invest in hammer stuff, but when you're just autoattacking, radiance with full reta is just minimally ahead of honor. However, you have to keep in mind than reta uptime comes with a cost unless you are in a party with some GS guards. You'll have to activate your heal skill on CD and sacrifice at least one, possibly even two utility skills to keep up the boon. In a real scenario, I'm pretty certain that honor pulls ahead by a fair margin, apart from having better utility anyway.
---
This isn't S1 references, this is just story continuity
---
So is this who you were originally talking about? In any case i assumed you were talking about this one https://massivelyop.com/2018/10/31/guild-wars-2s-legendary-upgrade-feature-accidentally-joins-weekly-patch-as-new-rmt-griefing-trick-emerges/. The user in that case was not banned or suspended and it aligned with the policy at the time. Perhaps the post you linked and other like it made anet revise their policy of handing out bans on the first infraction (harassment and trolling is a thing). 
---
As a side note, in my experience people often leave out important details when posting online about bans and suspensions and are rarely as innocent as they want the readers to believe.
---
So I have been level 80 for about a week now. I started doing my fractal dailies T1 to get my rings but now I have no clue how I am suppose to get the ascended armor needed to start doing T2+. What am I missing?
---
Asura Warrior, Human Ranger, Norn Mesmer, Charr Thief, Sylvari Elementalist &amp; Asura Engineer, in that order of creation. All of my characters rotate in use to either catch up on story or just to familiarize myself if after a major skill balance.
---
I recently (like yesterday) made a Human Revenant, so I'll be on that more often than my others. At least until the next living story chapter happens.
---
just need more Ka-Braham!
---
Exalted shoulders
---
7 - one of each class except warrior and engi (don't interest me)
---
My main for solo and group PvE is Renegade Revenant - his dps is insane and also very survivable. My absolute record is to down a veteran fire hydra in less than 10 seconds, before it even manages to complete a cycle of attack.
---
I also switch from time to time between a daredevil, fire elementalist and mirage mesmer
---
[Wiki says that she retreated into the mists at the end of season 1.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Captain_Mai_Trin) and........for the love of me can't find the forum post....or maybe I imagined it? Think a dev said that the real mai trin and horrik are in the mists while an echo of them are permanently fighting an echo of ellen kiel (basically the mai trin boss fractal).
---
i like your upfront attitude. most players won't mind taking a newbie or explaining things as long as they are aware from the start what they are getting into. most problems occur when people try to hide that they have no clue whatsoever about what they are doing and when it inevitably shows in their performance then the unaware carriers get salty and either kick immediately or arguments ensue.
---
the lesson here is that if you are new to any type of group content say so from the start, people will either take you and teach you along the way, or they will decline (politely most of the time) from the start and avoid any grief that may come.
---
I have one of each class, but really only ever play my mesmer, engineer, and my thief, and I tend to go through cycles where I'll play one of them almost exclusively for a few months, then switch off to another one. Dunno if this is something a lot of people do, but it's a nice compromise between my ADD side, and the part of me that wants to be able to play my chosen class well. Only the mesmer has all story missions and map complete done, but the thief is getting there.
---
They mostly have their own set of ascended gear- I only have one ascended pistol that floats between them, and I just slowly built those pieces up over time when I got irritated moving a ton of gear around (plus they all needed to have their own look, cause fashion wars).
---
My advice would to be to get to know the game with your guardian, but maybe try out some other classes and do what feels right to you. Most people I know seem to have a few favorites, and then the rest ultimately end up being parked at a farming area somewhere, or used as bank alts/bag openers.
---
Oh I sold it. Post haste! Not really my style but the gold ir fetched definitely is!
---
I am sorry that I am an amateur artist who mainly draws for fun in his off-work time, and that I offended you by posting on a gaming subreddit a picture that is not up to professional industry standards.
---
Hehe that sure is a nice income of money xD
---
Oh yeah most definitly! Getting Armorsmith to 500 is quite mandatory!
---
Was just about to cheap out since OP just wanted his Legendary so looking at the costs of different things might be an objective.
---
Starting at reset:
---
Matriarch. 
---
Timberline anomaly. 
---
Wait one hour for my static: Daily crafts to dump extra mats, WvW dailies (fill with PvE ones if i need/they worth it), Flax farm. May farm also iron/play/elderwood if i need/feel like it.
---
Fractals static (reset +1h 15 min). 
---
Go to bed.
---
I do CMs in the afternoon around reset -3 and if i want/have time i do chieves, dungeons, WvW, maybe a quick AB chest run.
---
Still dont have to tell the artist that. They can draw what they want to draw.
---
That's not how art and critique works.
---
Looks like the hero "iron cat" to me..
---
From what I've heard, it's just a random bug. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it.
---
I have four 80s, two boosted, one naturally leveled, the other i used level up tomes. 
---
That being said, I only ever play my main and literally use the other three to play fashion wars.
---
Power Daredevil (Main). 
---
Minstrel HB (WvW raids, healer for CM if i have to). 
---
BS (made for fractals... Never get to use it). 
---
WvW Soulbeast roamer + condi sb for raids if needed.
---
I can field power slb, dh and quickbrand by swapping gear around if i need. May gear Harrier druid next.  
---
5th slot is for keyruns and i don't plan on buying slots, though lately i'm itchint to try power reaper.
---
Stating you have a big dick doesn't make it true bud. Opening with an appeal to authority doesn't mean the rest of the drivel that follow is any more meaningful than the original comment. 
---
I can play gw2 for 20,000 hours and it wouldn't change the fact that comedy is subjective and you felt the need to make sure everyone around you knew you didn't enjoy this instead of using the downvote button like an adjusted individual. And did you really just use man tits as your insult lol? Everything you type further illustrates how socially inept you are.
---
Condi FB is as good as power, since they have very little ramp up.
---
Also you can heal with minstrel FB in fractals. I had Harriers and switched for WvW, and honestly the low power doesnt matter (but it's not good for most raids because you will pull from tank)
---
Don't be afraid of making alts, gw2 is probably the most altoholic-friendly game since so much stuff is account bound and it's so easy to level up to 80 with tomes and scrolls. If you enjoy guardian keep it thru all the story as a main but don't be afraid to try out other classes if you feel bored
---
Had some sleep and I would like to add that sharing some nasty opinions about a personally created piece is really horrible to do. This has nothing to do about your opinions, the artist wanted to draw it. If you really want to help the artist get better, give constructive critique, but if you're wanting to tear an artist down.. honestly why would you want to tear a person down because of something they created? Just keep your comments to yourself if you dont like it because the image is not for you.
---
Seriously, the thought process behind these comments utterly baffles me why you and some other users in here think is okay to share. Why try to discourage an artist?
---
Just run staff on ele for the open world.
---
mechanically the Engineer is a Ritualist. Thematically the Revenant is closer, channeling spirits and what not.
---
Yeah.  Long term group buffs are almost always terrible design because they are so much stronger than they feel.  It feels good to use big skills to burst a target or land clutch CC or heals.  Passive group buffs just stat check down encounters in ways you don't really feel but make a big impact.
---
&gt;  sacrifice at least one, possibly even two utility skills to keep up the boon.
---
which skills would you consider a sacrifice?
---
ok
---
I have all nine classes fully unlocked and all geared with at least exotics. I have played the entire game on both my Guardian and Mesmer, and selected content on the others.
---
For me, having this kind of alt-character friendly system is wonderful. It's fun to play for a week on a class I don't play mainly, and discover the things I forgot or didn't know about.
---
"human-shaped but not actually a human" has a term. It's "humanoid". In any case, you said yourself that you drew a sylvari version and so you should've titled the post as such.
---
Honor (1- 1/2 - 2 / 3). 
---
Radiance (x-x-2) or virtues (2/3 - 2 - 2/3). Virtues is usually too much heals, but is foolproof. Radiance helps DPS.
---
Firebrand 2-2-3. You can get extra mantra blocks and might by traitiny 2-1-3 since you should be able to perma quickness easy.
---
Axe for fury
---
Staff/scepter for might 
---
Mace for extra, unneeded heals.
---
Thank you for the feedback!
---
\-No MI is intentional, this build lacks the healing modifiers for it to be useful. instead we run tempests and scrappers with geyser and fx gyro for ressing. MI really is the stronger res utility though.
---
\-minstrels fb runs benevolence, rice balls, and bountiful oil. this makes up for the loss of boon duration from full minstrels with red lentils (3%), toxic oil (\~8%), and bounty sigil (15%) to make up for that loss. This also loses the boon duration from runes. minstrels runs 57% boon duration, this has 51%. so in total, only a 6% boon duration loss
---
\-as stated in the video, you can run wanderers armor in place of commanders for more hp at a slight damage loss. If you swap all the commanders gear to wanderers you get a higher EHP than minstrels, though that isn't realistic since minstrels provides their own healing. you also have the option of running damage reduction food that minstrels can't without losing a significant healing modifer
---
\-how much do you think healing power is adding to firebrand? f2's modifers are all under .77 and pure of heart is .5, the only trait/skill for fb with a good healing modifier of 1.0 is the dodge heal. Most of fb's healing output is from the outgoing healing modifiers it has available from monk's runes and the honor traitline. Let the scrappers and tempests heal since they do a better job of it imo
---
\-I was completely in agreement with you a week ago, but after watching some videos on youtube and trying it myself, the burning output is too high to get cleansed. with just me applying burning, scrappers could keep up and drop my damage by half. with a few of us using it, they can't keep up at all. especially since scourges have the same range and provide a large variety of cover conditions. This is no downstate week too, normally there would be downs to proc PW on for better damage as well
---
\-all of the pugs are behind me and you can see on the damage meter how much they're contributing in comparison. Most people just melt as soon as they clump up, scrappers or not. We're up against nsp and sos this week, so it's hard to get a good test in since they refuse to engage until you get to the lords room of whatever they're defending. next week should yield some better fights to showcase =D
---
6 year old girls shouldn't drink?
---
I am not going to comment about number of classes.  I would like to make 2 recommendations that I haven't seen (or missed in skimming)
---
1)  make a character of each race.  In Heart of Thorns, you can get different dialog on one of the races for the story.  It's rare, but it exists.  
---
2) make as many characters now as you think you will play later.  Reason for this is birthday presents.  You'll thank me later.
---
Am I imagining or does Sabetha say something different if the party is all female?  I can't remember.  I recommend that you have at least 1 character that is a gender other than the rest.
---
Meanwhile this is the highest rated comment in your post (for good reason) and all your comments responding to the criticism cement how bad you are at this game.
---
Horrik unleash the cannons!
---
For Core Tyria Stats like Berserker (wich imo should be best to start into fractals) you get the cheapest Rings from Fractals, you allrdy bought them.
---
The best/cheapest way to obtain Trinkets is to do those weekly guildmissions and buy them from vendors in your Guildhall.
---
You get a Necklace from WvW currency and laurels so buy it from the PvP/WvW vendor in the Battlegrounds and not from the PvE Vendor in lionsarch.
---
You get a backpiece if you flush down different mats in the mystic forge, look up a guide on that, there are even different transmogs: quiver or books etc if you're a ranger or mage they might look cool.
---
You can infuse and attune rings, you can also infuse your back so it has more agony slots!
---
Thats your first step into higher Fractals, if you want acended armor or weapons you need the jobs up to 500 and also maybe need different weapon crafting jobs like artificer or weaponsmith. Ascended weapons cost like 80gold per piece and ascended armor costs like 60gold...
---
If you need some HoT stats like Viper you can add another +20gold on top of that.
---
curb your enthusiasm
---
Quaggan version of Eeyore with that expression, just needs a pair of floppy ears!
---
Lmbo and you go to dicks? What a loser you are. If you play 20000 hours of the game you will likely have a better comprehension of "inside jokes" within the game than if you have just started and aren't familiar with the game just yet. I would have thought that would be obvious, but again..you lack comprehension skills. ta ta loser...talk about dicks some more.
---
Cute dogs.
---
A bit of WvW now and then (not this week though with no down state), but mostly farming Palawadan and Silverwastes for my next legendary.
---
Brought to you by the "please stop telling people to do something objectively horrible in a gamemode that is already difficult to get properly organized groups involved in" gang.
---
if you dont mind me asking, whats your friends history with the bans from rmt. Was it like hey you got gold/items from RMT source have a 30 day ban on first time? then 60? then 90? or w/e.
---
&gt; everybody multiclass here, is pretty much mandatory...
---
​I hate that mentality. Or rather, I hate alts. I play ele since the release of the game, I have 30-40 lvl necro and 80 lvl rev that I just pvp'd with for a bit I think. I think what pushes me away from alts is having to unlock/explore whole map, do the story, buy bag slots etc etc. Final Fantasy is very cool in that regard.
---
It depends on the fight structure. On fight with dps phases DH is better. On fight with constant dps, DD is usually better.
---
It's not a design decision, it's actually a player behavior. 
---
Metas start at a certain time, there is no real wait time. The "wait time" we are talking about is actually the time between "you can't join a good map" and start of the event. 
---
It's just how it is, people join the map to do the meta, one map gets full, mostly a second map gets full and then there aren't enough players for another map *or* they don't organize, becaus they try to get on one of the full maps *or* they came just too late so the meta starts before they can organize. So in a perfect situation, you could join TD meta at :30 and VB Meta at :00.
---
You see the there is no designed wait time for any meta. Except that one timer at the end of TD meta.
---
I can't comment on the specific amount of time banned, but yes it was similar to that.  However, he emphasized to me that the first few bans were so short, that he accepted the bans as an acceptable cost to getting the items.  I.e. he wanted legendary weapons, didn't have time to earn them (grad school), and decided to just accept the bans.  The only reason he stopped was that the ban periods had grown long enough that now he is at like, a month+ for each ban.
---
That is not the time I am referring to ... on a decently organized VB you hit t4 with about 10-12 minutes left. There is nothing you can do but wait for the final reward popup.
---
For TD at least the ones I've particpated in the wait is around half that.
---
Compare to AB and DS where you complete the meta then immediately go grab the loot and do whatever.
---
Rifle deadeye has some words for you
---
The replies are interesting. Having to wait the full timer out to get the rewards is bad design and silly. It should detect when it's over and fire the cannons in 30 seconds or something to give people a chance to get there. 
---
Dunno why you're getting pushback, OP but I suspect it's something to do with white armor.
---
it's so good at breaking Blademaster Diarmid's breakbar when she spins to win!
---
Raiders can go play wow or ff14. GW2 isn't a raiding MMO.
---
I only have Snargle (male charr necro) and I'll die with Snargle fite me
---
1-burn all 4 lanes? god damn, good job!
---
I envy ya. The guild I'm in basically died out. Our leader plays less and less despite his channel having originally been almost only about GW 2. Now he's off doing PS4 games instead.
---
His last log in was 5 days ago.
---
LS3 maps for HoT stats
---
Those first three don't feel like S1 references. They're just comments on the characters' pasts, which were first explored when they were introduced.
---
Hero-Tron was also involved in events after S1 so again I don't consider that a reference.
---
The mushrooms also makes you see Wintersday elf Faren, Caudecus, and Mad King Thorn. I don't think there is any real intention of who was picked beyond "funny choices and DE".

Canach has been doing explosives the entire time we've known him. In S2, in S3, in PoF, even earlier in S4. The chuckle comment is just Canach being Canach, like him whistling while planning bombs in Long Live the Lich then whistling louder when asked if he's done.
---
So I don't see these as references. But then again one of ArenaNet's hints that Lazarus was Balthazar was the Balthazar Shield a random White Mantle Knight following Caudecus was wielding in the cinematic that "Lazarus" first revealed himself. So hey, maybe.
---
When I saw the Grove Hydra backpiece, I knew I had to color the rest of my gear according to it, and this was the result.

I do enjoy support. Is minstrel good for raids or what should I do there? If minstrel works for pve then I don't have to do vipers. I just really wanted vipers to shred through trash mobs
---
Haha, nice. I just [posted mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bie2t1/lets_stupidiously_match_our_outfits_to_our_backs/em32tjo/) when I saw yours!
---
Wasn't that canceled?
---
So minstrels is fine for raids and dungeons and fractals too?
---
Zerker.... God I just want to limit the amount of armor and weapons sets I need.. I only have so much gold @_@
---
&gt; will start a **few weeks** after World Boss Week
---
Seems to me that there will be a window for it before the Meta-Event rush.
---
Really great idea! This will definitely shake things up.
---
All i want are those invisible boots. Like, I don't even care about how much money they'll make, I just fucking hate shoes
---
Yeah.  Someone mentioned may 14 in the other thread, and I'm thinking "Why would they have a meta event week if episode 6 is out?  You don't need to entice people to play when the last episode is out.  But maybe it's possible the meta event thing happens after episode 6, and before season 5.  Episode 6 has to release at SOME point.
---
Just take 'em off :^)
---
&gt;The second event, Meta-Event Rush, will start a few weeks after the World Boss Week. During this week, our intention is to remove the daily cap on all world meta event completion rewards and to reward additional loot for some of our Meta-Events to pair with some ***improvements to the Path of Fire map meta events. More info will come closer to the event.***
---
IT'S HAPPENING
---
Then both expansion are pretty far away. I believe it was around 50 gold per episode, it's in gem store, you can check it out.
---
Amazing to see weekly Bonus' events being added/enabled. Thank you ANet &lt;3
---
You’re in luck, that’s exactly their plan. More bonus events.
---
My little asura engi uses PvP Mistforged head to toe with *Radiant gloves/shoulders.. it’s cheesy but cool.
---
(*I think it’s the radiant ones?.. it’s the free white glowing skin ones from AP chests)
---
Really it’s all about wearing something nice but understated enough that it lets those tendrils still be the “shiney” when they pop!
---
World Boss farm incoming.
---
Speaking of character slots, I was wondering if there is a technical reason why character slots can't go above 70. 
---
I would really like to be able to buy at least up to 90 character slots so I can get race + class + gender. 
---
But, it was kept at 70 for some reason. I am hoping you or maybe someone could explain why 70 character slots?
---
&gt;The second event, Meta-Event Rush, will start a few weeks after the World Boss Week. During this week, our intention is to remove the daily cap on all world meta event completion rewards and to reward additional loot for some of our Meta-Events to pair with some improvements to the Path of Fire map meta events.
---
No cap sounds kinda crazy but also neat. Also, PoF Meta improvements are nice to see. Aside from the Casino one, I don't think I've done those metas much outside of some achievements; hopefully, that changes...
---
But the stats D:
---
So much the Mesmers at the jumping puzzles. I'm especially bad at jumping puzzles so the Mesmer players are lifesavers. Such good people.
---
Im pretty certain that im the naked chick with the glowing gloves in the top photo. 
---
Also yeah, you are a great guild leader. You keep the game fun as a game, instead of locking the fun bits behind accomplishments and responsibility.
---
I can't hear you
---
&gt; We welcome your ideas for additional events
---
Core classes only WvW week(end)
---
&gt; “It feels like when you look at me you only see an enormous glob of ectoplasm,” the Shatterer wept. “I don’t know what we mean to each other anymore.”
---
And that's why I always return to GW2's main page to read those charming little blurbs.
---
wow, I have had no idea there was a 70 limit! I have about 40 max level alts, but I spread them out between a few accounts. I only have about 15-20 on one account.
---
No idea why that number would be the cap.
---
I'm not sure I love the idea when it seems like the solution to, "What would get players playing?" is, "Let's just wrap up the rarest drops in the game and throw money at players!"
---
I know that's a bit of slippery slope fallacy on my part, but I really hope they lean towards the base design being fun, interesting, and lucrative in its own right while not diluting the few iconic rewards left in the game.
---
No one seems to be mentioning the lazy fast method for an ascended back is to throw 60g worth of mats in the mystic forge.. takes less than 5 minutes
---
As I said soon after this was posted - yes, should've probably used the term "humanoid", but as not a native speaker and since I didn't like the sound of that in the context, I assumed "human form" would suffice. "Sylvari version" would've still been incorrect wording since it's not plant material even if the silhouette is similar. Regardless, the fact that this gets so much focus makes me think that the real issue is people seeing many unconventional monster features in place of emotionally safe, generic human-limited ones, and not some terms.
---
Are you going to imply that isn't the case in HoT metas? They never really needed good gear, just man power.
---
For me:
---
* Getting bored of Fractals
---
* I already grinded out everything including weapons + achievements in the LS. 
---
* LS4e1,3,4,5 doesn't have selectable ascended trinkets.
---
I thought bump stocks were illegal :)
---
As opposed to what? Are you insinuating world bosses require anything more? lel.
---
Nobody uses Shadow Arts for anything because people are focused on increasing their damage, and Shadow Arts doesn't have things geared to that.  The only damage-increasing trait it has is Leeching Venoms, which actually was briefly meta for condi thieves, but fell out of favour when other options strengthened.
---
Shadow Arts has a lot of defensive traits.  It might be useful here and there for World vs. World thieves who are more focused on being annoying than bursting people down.  But overall, it's the lack of offense in the trait line that keeps it from being used.
---
&gt; honestly why would you want to tear a person down because of something they created?
---
Anything uncommon has unknown in it. When something is unknown, it induces fear. When something induces fear, the predator's instinct instructs to attack and kill before it tries to attack and kill you, compromising your integrity.
---
The fact that this is not physical but psychological doesn't matter: "I should destroy this before it challenges my worldview and I learn something new about myself that would cause different thoughts that would make me uncomfortable."
---
It's less about character slots and more about enabling you to play anything other than your "main".
---
I've definitely played MMOs in the past where playing on an alt was more like playing on a second account, and really felt like a waste of time/resources that you could be putting into your main.
---
In GW2 (once level 80), 90% of the progress helps your entire account, not just that character.  This really frees you up to play whatever character you want.
---
I really do not like the route of removing the daily cap on world/meta bosses. Anet, have you not learned? If a event/boss gives too much loot it will be farmed/abused/exploited as much as possible and that is not healthy for the game. Why remove the cap when you can just increase the rewards? That would promote players to go out and do them but not show up every single time.
---
I doubt that, Scrapper can't heal others as well or they'd be picked into any PvE fractal or raid comp. I have literally never seen scrapper besides PvP and guess their strengh is somewhere else besides throughput healing.
---
You see mate if a class is good it gets played in other modes too not just WvW.
---
\*toxic casuals
---
It is just for a week...
---
What? Are you having a stroke or something?
---
This might be surprising to you, but... BearBow rangers in blue gear can already participate in Vinewrath, and the Battle of Tarir, and Chak Gerent.  You don't have the ability to control who participates in open world content.
---
That's the problem, though. The metas are already typically fun and interesting. The only reason people aren't doing them is because they're not lucrative enough.
---
I started out making one of every profession, now I have duplicates of some profession's for quick build swapping for raids. 
---
But, I haven't raided in a while so now those characters are parked at a flax farm. I mostly play Chrono, DH, and whatever character I am currently map completing with. I think that it's a good idea to pick three characters that you really enjoy playing and that have different play styles, it helps to mix things up.
---
Don't be ridiculous.
---
Those infusions won't be worth 10k gold. :\^)
---
*rimshot*
---
But no seriously if they actually aren't super rare I hope that we get a way to disable them. My frames suffer enough.
---
I really wish they'd add the likes of Fire Shaman/Foulbear Kraal/Dredge Commi/all the temples to the fixed timers. Barely done those world bosses since they introduced megaservers
---
Makes the most sense unfortunately....
---
You get spirit shards from exp and that's a lot of gold !!!!
---
(Except Diviner's)
---
OOOHHHH who lives in a pineapple under the sea?!
---
&gt; the few iconic rewards left
---
credit card heroes uprising
---
Your raid symbol flair definitely is suspicious
---
Nice job.  That first asura looks really good!
---
Depends what you're talking about?
---
People are always logged in for the HoT metas so they must be lucrative enough.  The PoF metas suck, and need to be redesigned (which it sounds like they're doing.)  Same goes for world bosses.  But if the only chance that they're even worth doing is during these events,  then you haven't fixed the underlying problem at all.
---
Here you go:  https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWarsDyeJob/comments/aln3aa/funerary_fab/
---
that's not the point OP is making.  The point is that this game rewards bad play i.e bearbow ranger in blue gear spamming 1 and getting a 10k gold infusion.  There is zero skill or effort involved to do that and you can get a massive reward for it.  They should make meta events much much harder so you actually need to know what your doing and have a good understanding of your class to complete them.   Maybe cap World Boss and large meta event maps to 50 or less 15 minutes before the event spawns and keep them the same so it actually forces people to play well instead of brain AFK spamming 1.  But hey, that's what gamers of this generation want: do little to nothing and get big shinies for it.
---
Glowy stuff is Foefire.  Chest is Krytan.
---
You kinda forgot the most important aspect of support FB; that of resetting fights with MI. Much like how signet of mercy is a must take for support FB in PvP for its ability to instantly turn the tide of a fight, the same applies to MI in WvW. Taking MI without healing power modifiers makes it useless, so FB is best played with minstrel stats. 
---
Also, you will struggle to survive as a frontline with the setup you've posted. Against random pugs in EB, sure, but you won't last long enough to do dps on a build like yours in any serious fight.
---
BRING back the Marionette event!
---
Hands and legs are both spearmarshal
---
I'd love to see a Jumping Puzzle focused event.
---
Today i find myself leveling second guardian (my main is guard also)
---
Love elementalist and thief too, but didn't play much on them
---
Did they ever say that class balance is a priority for them?
---
You can try starting another episode, then going back. I did that to reset progress on Beast of War for Achievements on my Warrior's first playthrough.
---
I may have a dump question but is it possible to play this game without a 2 weapon set? 
---
Since you can swap your weapons very easy it feels like you are forced to play with 2 weapon sets? For example on warrior I feel like I have to swap constantly between sword and / sward + shield (just an example). 
---
Im a very old school mmorpg player and I like to conzentrade on only 1 weapon set with the skills and dont want to think about „oh I need to switch now, i need the swap here and there“. 
---
So is there a class playable without a second weapon gear? If so which one?
---
I hope the changes go deeper than rewards. They could really use some structural and design improvements as well.
---
You can go to the Ice Bitter frontier and collect enough unbound magic and berries and get the icebrood ascended back pack. You can select any stats on it. 
---
Also if you want to change any stats on any type of gear the mystic forge has your back.
---
Maybe not but it should be.
---
&gt;  They should make meta events much much harder so you actually need to know what your doing and have a good understanding of your class to complete them.
---
Fun fact, every new bosses are hard at first, but eventually people will always find a way to circumvent intended designs.
---
I don't think it's possible to design an open world boss well-balanced enough to be equally hard (or at least requiring extensive knowledge) for all professions. It's a technical challenges that get pretty much voided by the openness of it.
---
That's why raids exist. Their sole purpose is to offer tough challenges that require more preparation, strategy and understanding of your profession. But don't expect something remotely similar in PVE open world.
---
All my ascended armor is for dps specs, I'd love to try out a support firebrand build but don't want to grind out a fourth ascended set.
---
if you make something unachievable your priority, you set yourself up for failure
---
Believe me. If we are talking about episodes made by 3 team it is better to wait. These episodes are the poorest and this is probably because they don't have that much manpower like team 1 and 2.
---
Is condi soulbeast still relatively viable for raids and fractals? I have always played ranger as my main and am returning to playing after having him fully decked out in ascended viper gear/runes/150 AR. Im working on creating a druid set for him as well right now, but didn't know if I should also consider changing all this condi gear to power if that is the only viable damage build anymore. Thanks!
---
I take it as an opportunity to explore trait lines and weapons I don't favor in my mains, just to see if I can understand the class a little better. And story-wise: whatever I don't remember.
---
I'll also take my weekly farmers to 40 for the free Order weapon and second key.
---
I remember the rumor being that they were forced to drop an unannounced project. All their focus is on GW2 now, not split between GW2 and whatever their next game might have been.
---
I really want the Highlands meta to actually be worthwhile. That has all the makings of a second silverwastes in it.
---
Feels like the best opportunity to burn out during that and not touch the game afterwards... at least until new episode will be released.
---
It has already happened, sadly.
---
I've never heard of these.  Are they proper world bosses, or just difficult events?
---
It happens literally every time I pug for cm’s. I’ll join an observatory cm tonight without the LNHB title on and I’ll report back. I guarantee you I will end up getting flamed and kicked even if they didn’t specify the title.
---
They essentially are world bosses, but they spawn within a certain window rather than at a specific time.
---
Back before the [megaserver system](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/introducing-the-megaserver-system/) was introduced in 2014, all world bosses were like that, then they [added a schedule](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/the-megaserver-system-world-bosses-and-events/) to most (but not all) WBs. You can find the extraneous ones [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_boss) -  they technically count as world bosses, with the same daily limits, so presumably they're worth looking out for if you want to as much as possible during the bonus event
---
Since coming up with a good idea &amp; then never actually fully completing/tidying it is Anet's approach to everything, I doubt they'll ever add the rest
---
show me a video of a minstrels fb even coming close to a tempest or scrappers healing output =D
---
As long as it's only for a week, it should be mostly fine.
---
Burn guard is actually good when paired with necro.
---
Ironically enough however it tends to work better as DH because they have traits to also apply cripple &amp; vuln on justice proc as well as the reveal.
---
As people pointed out, I think Shadow Arts are just focused in two things: being annoying vs other players with stealth, or help other players skip areas with stealth.
---
I made a second thief just to theme it around SA, as a "help others" flavor. Kinda hoping someday there will be a thief spec that focus on heal and minor support. But SA could as well be that, since it does have a lot of traits that heals. It is just that...they only benefit the thief or they are incredibly underwhelming (Like Shadow Protector with just 3 seconds of regen. So generous.)
---
Hopefully those traits can be revisited at sometime to give it more purpose than just stealth. Make one trait at each tier focused on heal (a more powerful Shadow Protector, a Concealed Defeat that reduces cooldown on Deceptions and makes Shadow Refuge revives players by %, etc), one focused on stealth (for pvp and wvw purposes.  [Shadow's Embrace](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shadow%27s_Embrace) ,  [Hidden Thief](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hidden_Thief)  and  [Shadow's Rejuvenation](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shadow%27s_Rejuvenation) or  [Cloaked in Shadow](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cloaked_in_Shadow)  are basically those already. Those would benefit players for staying longer on stealth. Those are, and would be useless for PVE) and one free for whatever comes into the mind of the devs.
---
Group goal to reach enough kills for rewards.
---
I assume they mean https://twitter.com/GuildWars2/status/1028312141621690368
---
well... they DID release HoT the same week (day?) as halloween stuff started up that year
---
Eh, competetiveness breeds toxicity. All games, all modes.
---
Only if portals will be disabled anywhere close to any jumping puzzle. We know they can do that.
---
If I remember right, the metas are Casino Blitz in Crystal Oasis, Treasure Hunt in Desert Highlands, the Ascension/Doppelganger stuff in Elon Riverlands, Mouth of Torment in The Desolation, and the Branded Forgotten temple thing in Vabbi. The Highlands one does seem pretty neat; it would be awesome if that were like a second Silverwastes.
---
Personally, I'm most interested in the Desolation and Vabbi ones. I don't recall if the Mouth of Torment was a difficult one, but it is an iconic area so it would be nice to see a more worthwhile event. The Vabbi one I recall being decently hard and kinda like the Octovine; it feels like it should be as popular as Tarir so hopefully the improvements address that.
---
The game is trash now. The story sucks, the achievements are boring, and the rewards are lack luster.  The entire game has come down to farming gold to convert to gems to buy mount skins in the shop.
---
Multiple Matriarch daily. Multiloot.
---
So glad I got the World Boss Portal Device  &gt;...&gt;
---
Ele with scepter/dagger.   I used to go warrior with axe/axe. mace/mace, but a buddy I go with got me to swap. 
---
We also go to level 40, and sometimes all the way to 80 depending on how many tomes we have that week.  When we go to 80, we get keys from primary story at 10/40 &amp; 60, then Tangled Paths in LWS2, and we map Bloodstone Fen for a chance at a key (it's *super fast*, plus with get the aerial skill user and magic gatherer dailies)
---
Bonus event weeks are such a good way to stay relevant when gamers are choosing between what games to play, it helps them prioritize.  These are LONG over due as being more regular events.
---
I've literally never done that event, nor the Hounds, nor the one in the Desolation. I've given up loading in before it starts and seeing literally zero people there. It's sad.
---
I’d like to point out to oppose everyone that say SA is useless now that stealth on dodge is nerfed and that it gives no offense. 
---
While it may be true SA is not offense oriented, DE does enough damage as it is if you utilize signet of shadows, assassins signet, and crit strikes. 
---
I use SA with crit strikes and can proc impressive numbers while still maintaining stealth and initiative thanks to SA. 
---
I guess it’s just a pref i guess.
---
Possible yes (with Ele and Engie as already mentionned) but you will lose some depth to what the game can offer you.
---
Sometimes weapons are situational. For example you swap to Mace+Mace on Warrior when you need a huge CC burst, or to Shortbow on Thief for additional mobility.
---
The rest of the time it's mostly because you used most/all you skills on that weapon set so you go use those of the other set while they recharge instead of "just" auto attacking.
---
With that said some classes work very well (sometimes by design) with only 1 weapon set: Power Daredevil will rarely swap out of Staff in PvE, Soulbeast with Double Shortbow technically always uses the same weapon and the weapon swap is just here to trigger a "on swap" sigil. And some build will also probably work in a good enough manner if you just stick to the "main" weapon set.
---
Thread removed: Not relevant to Guild Wars 2.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Before traits change, thief is very weak in the begining, especially for I still do not know how to play the game. 
---
Letting a new player know how blind work(there was no defiance bar in that time), kitting and using skill to evade is a bit harsh.
---
However, on POF maps, forged and canid taught me again, PPF gear is out-dated, many solo mission can not be soloed by zerkers.
---
I hope they were able to do something good for the Treasure Hunt. Desert Highlands is one of my favorite maps, but there's not usually much reason to wander up that way.
---
Absolute minimal effort required as far as dev time goes.  It takes almost nothing to punch in an extra reward for tasks that already exist as part of the game, and to write up a 2 paragraph blog post to announce it.  And it buys time for the devs to work on their next project.  
---
It's basically like an extended daily quest in its function.  It guides players toward specific content that already exists for a specific time period, and gets those players playing together for a short while.  
---
It's these little things that can go a long way toward extending the life of an  MMO, with the caveat that devs must be careful to not over-rely on such filler events.  At some point, they can become redundant.  Then, in the absence of real content releases, they can counter-productively make players even more jaded.
---
Mount sucked me back to wvw even after I long finished it.  Finished the Triumphant tracks and working on Hero's now .... Might take a while.
---
They are pretty good actually..but so is 90% of other elite specs.
---
So if it's anything like black lion chests I shouldn't expect to see anything above uncommon. But unlike the Black lion chest which had actually decent stuff in the uncommon section this one is just more mats.
---
I could wait until the 21st if they at least released the trailer tomorrow D:
---
Autoattack only WvW week(end)
---
thank you!
---
1 week of boss monsters yesssss

Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.
---
EU time zone in NA server, means no time to raid.
---
And fractals, it is fun for new players, but I have been doing these for years.
---
love them &lt;3
---
I just made Binding of Ipos. Don't see it around very often. Totally worth it
---
i hope that’s satire
---
I want a dungeon week! Like the old dungeons AC , COF etc. been a while since anything was focused on those.
---
Yes they can, even on squishiest classes/builds. Outside of raids and fractals, the game is too easy.
---
It's also useful if you don't wanna have to think too much about when/where you stealth and give some error margins if people lose some time while running (and this only requires to kow the usual/easy stealth spots).
---
Even before the trait changes there was never a problem with the first bosses, yes thief was weaker but you could easily counter that with the right gear for the level and believe me I don´t think I am good player and I too die sometimes but you can do every mission solo with zerker gear, in PoF it is even easier than in HoT.
---
Cautiously optimistically hoping that the Path of Fire maps are getting the HoT treatment.
---
Finals are this week for me! Good luck on yours (:
---
If you don't enjoy a game, why keep investing in it and coming back for expansions? It's fine to not like a game and move on :V
---
Because I wish something may changed...
---
the only purpose shadow arts really serves is to improve your stealth giving and give you survival bonuses while in stealth, so basically you just put it on to get an extra couple seconds of stealth while skipping things. since most pve gameplay has greatly drifted away from mobs that can be skipped with stealth its use has been severely gutted.
---
I am not very hate the game, just losing patient for non-changed and always-glitched contents.
---
this game has a ton of content that never gets done because it’s not rewarding. hopefully they target those things too. a dungeon event would be great...
---
* Don't ever give leader permissions to anyone else.  
---
* Care, invite permission is also kick permission.
---
* Make 2-3 persons in which you trust officers to help you out and talk with them when you doubt if doing X is a good idea.
---
* No matter what, you are just another member of the guild, have fun with them, play stuff in group, don't let your rank create a barrier between you and other members.
---
That happened to me too a couple weeks ago. First time I have ever gotten a real good look at the wyverns.
---
Is this a ploy to sell those world event boss teleporters?
---
I admit I was interested in them but when people say that maybe Tequatll is the only core boss worth doing, it puts a bit of a damper....
---
20k crits from stealth in WvW.
---
Mine will be starting at May 20 so i think i will survive.
---
I mean... i hope.
---
Personally I prefer Asura Staff/Hammer Revenant,  [College of Synergetics](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/College_of_Synergetics)(green square during creation), and Varkk's a snake, but Pol's my krewemate. I can't leave him to die. (the choice in A Sparkling Rescue) 
---
In "Taking Credit Back" you need to just focus on the golum with the teleporter, after being teleported ignore the first set of mobs and just fight off the second set and rez the golum. 
---
The password for the cell in "Stand By Your Krewe" is static(311), so you can bypass all enemies except the set at the door in the beginning and the end. 
---
It's roughly the same speed as what you are doing but I find it a bit easier especially using a Revenant with Vengeful Hammers.
---
Ah damn, my bad.
---
Ah yeah, I remember that one. Thx for clarifying it for me. :)
---
I've been trying to clear out my birthday lvl20 boosts and been having fun on ranger with sun spirit and fire trap. 
---
They melt things pretty fast but today I had a blast on turret engi. Thumper + flames turret makes things more face roll than they all ready are.
---
If its purely lvl 10 I tend to just go guardian or necro or sometimes thief.
---
Thanks for the link. Thought they meant something that happened just recently. ^^
---
the cap is actually 69 but if you capped out before ehte expansions, then you also got the free ones with that so it bumped itover. i didn't get max character slots until after hot but before pof so i was able to get to 69 then pof came out and the free slot bumped it to 70. if you did it before both expansions, you should be capped at 71.
---
if we could get the cap removed or bumped to at least 90, i'll get at least another 20 character slots.
---
Nah, almost everyone completes PoF story missions and open world content while solo with glass-canon builds (berserker or viper). If you cannot survive, that's fine, but understand that if you put the effort into self-improvement you could handle it easily. It's not your build that's at fault, and it's not the game, it's just that you need more practice at avoiding damage, killing things quickly, and breaking defiance bars. There's no shame in needing more practice. You can do it, my friend!
---
I'm not saying they can achieve perfect balance but they need to at least try to work towards it with applicable resources.
---
Thanks.  I have tons of medium so maybe ill give that a go.
---
They don't have an achievement under "world bosses" so they technically aren't, I guess?
---
Get legendary armor.  I try out new builds all the time and can't tell you how much it helps.
---
Clearly, you've never played a minstrels scrapper or seen videos of a good one. Might want to do that, it's eye opening
---
hey I play in EU. Can I join you?
---
&gt; Highlands meta
---
What meta? :P

I've got 8 characters now, but I really only have one I play regularly (my weaver). I've got a necro (scourge), mesmer (mirage), another ele (support tempest), thief (currently daredevil but I like deadeye too), engi (holosmith), ranger (who doesn't have any of the elite specs yet), and a rev (who's only level 31). 
---
My weaver is the only one with 100% map and story completion, because she was my first character. Rev is definitely growing on me- it might be the second class I actually go for map and story comp on, but I've done a fair amount with my holosmith too. 
---
You can definitely have a bunch of different alts, especially if you're planning on just doing raids/fractals/pvp/wvw on them. It's very easy to hop on an HP train and get all the HPs you need to complete a character. The only thing alts aren't as friendly for is open-world events (like world bosses, farming, guild missions...), since it's really best to have as many waypoints as possible to do things in the open world, but mounts have made that less important. 
---
And sometimes, it's actually really good to have a bunch of different characters with different professions! There are some achievements that are much easier if you have a high-DPS ele or thief; there are some that you really need the high HP and sustain of a necro or warrior for; and there are some times when having access to your own mesmer portals makes things much, much easier.
---
Unless it's a wvw/pve raid leading or organizing huge community of people, there's not much (or any) leadership involved in gw2. You don't have to lead guild just because you created it, it can simply be a group of like-minded people who have same goals.
---
No, the max is 70. I got the max cap after the expansion.
---
70.
---
Let's see if we can't discern your problem with a bit more clarity from your OP and other posts in the thread. You're finding the game in the open world too hard. And you don't feel like you're progressing.
---
This is a game based on player skill progression more than stat progression. You can't just outstat things and beat them in a lot of cases, particularly in end game. You have to get better. Some would consider that a form of progression.
---
The fact that you have trouble facing two blade pete in a level 10 story tells more of the story, You want the game to get good for you, but you don't want to learn the best ways to play it. 
---
I play every single profession and there's no zone or story in the game I can't complete solo, and it's not because I'm a great player. I'm an average player.  I'm old, I'm sore most of the time, I'm tired all the time, but somehow, I'm able to get through pretty much every story and zone on every character.
---
Many of us came here because there is no gear treadmill and we don't get more and more powerful. The name of the game is to get better.
---
The question you should be asking yourself is how can I progress at the game, rather than how the game can make me more powerful, so I can get through things that other people have less trouble getting through.
---
Not sure on the actual healing part, but Scrappers are most wanted in WvW for their cleansing ability; heals are certainly there as well.
---
In PvE, they're not a thing because they provide almost zero offensive utility. For example, Druids provide fury and might, Renegades can provide Might, Alacricty, and Life Leech, while Firebrands provide Quickness so even when taken as healers will improve overall dps output. Scrappers don't and half their gyro functionality is useless in PvE as well. 
---
In the end, scrappers are a case of a spec suited entirely towards pvp/wvw.
---
Skill progressing, sounds very good.
---
Your endurance is not infinite, and skill progressing is but change build, gears to counter the mob, yes, veteran bristlebrike and vampire beast bloodsucker forced ppl to do it.
---
I changed to dire/trailblazer, this is so-called experience. GW2 is not Dark Souls2, stat still important. I have soloed lupi, but still feel bad on new maps.
---
And not everygame have so boring  gear treadmill, it is 2019 now, even WOW gave up the crual grinding. (and Rift is dying) However, GW2's restrict of people's pential sometimes made me feel very bad.
---
Format's sake.
---
&gt; I just hope they are higher then similar tiers from black lion chests or 99.9% players won't see a single item from the super rare tier.
---
dont. just dont. always assume the worst when it comes to RNG, you'll do a big favor to your morale and sanity.
---
Only two :
---
- My main from day one, an ele, that done everything except any recent group content.
---
- A druid since hots, because it's brainded for most group content so I don' even need to play to get my raids and fractals done. I just put some magi and now some harrier gears, I don't even think I have sigils on his weapons.
---
I asked the support to change my ele for something else but they can't, so i'll just still leeching :/
---
I would love for this game to do something similar to BDO in that every week has a special event going. Some of them are stupid, some of them give shit rewards, but it's always something to look forward to seeing.
---
That one is fishy, that Soul Spiral is doing like 20k more than it's supposed to above 50%, he doesn't show his traits, and has fear on
---
They still won't tell you the chances. Because it's 0.00000001%
---
Have fun with your gamblers fallacy homies, don't forget to buy some gems while you wait for the boss to spawn.
---
This is 'squichest class'/'squichest build'? Like MM-condihealing pahua reaper, defensive traits and damage mitigation?
---
That's what all of your treasure hunting kits are for ;)
---
Connecting an RMT post to your guild wars 2 account name, bold move
---
I didn't find the need to change to dire or trailblazer to get through story or open world. I use, on most of my alts, berzerker or vipers. Killing faster has been more effective for me than trying to stay alive longer. A lot of it is strategy. Placement of mobs. Pulling. Running in and facetanking is often a bad idea.
---
  
---
If you are running in knowing your enemies is really important. Which guys to kill in which order, and what their weaknesses are.  In addition in Heart of Thorns for example, masteries can help a lot.  And it doesn't mean you'll never die. But you shouldn't be dying that often and this game really doesn't have much of a penalty for dying.
---
At any rate, I see myself getting better at the game all the time. Which is my form of progression. There's also story progression and mastery progression for others.  
---
But at the end of the day it may just not be the game for you. For example, I've never liked or enjoyed WoW. I woudn't go back there if you paid me, even though I know it's a good game for some people.
---
My offer is 1 Viatnamese dong.
---
Sounds good, but many ranges and vets spawns in one time said no.
---
I soloed some HOT hero change mobs, but still feel the new maps are too unfriendly too berserker warrior.

[Poor Shatterer. It seems his many historical attempts at using DragonMatch.net didn't lead to healthy relationships with random Tyrian adventurers or the Commander in the long run despite his genuinely heartwarming profile. :(](https://twitter.com/guildwars2/status/691984661329874944)
---
However, I'm glad that Anatoli Ingram (assuming it's him writing the blurb as he's usually the *cough* culprit behind such insightful blurbs as well as the former comments from Evon Gnashblade, the true hero of LA and Tyria, in the old BLTC promotion posts) keeps the Shatterer's riveting love story going as an ongoing saga. 
---
Perhaps one day good ol' Shatterer will finally find his destined soulmate, maybe in the sturdy and ever punctual Wrathbringer [who became his successor as Kralk's lieutenant](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/802982/#Comment_802982): it can be love at first spike of [dragon energy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon_energy)! #DragonMinionLoveMatters :)
---
uhhhh lul
---
its undertuned because stealth is often useless in pve and annoying in pvp/wvw
---
These happened before 3 years for me.
---
For warriors, toughness works better because of healing signet, and do not have a lot of dodging/blind/running/pets to 'not face-tank' a lot of damage. or you can not kill things faster(with shield).
---
Have you looked for current open world builds on sites like meta battle?
---
TT is old hat now.. most players have done all the associated achievements.
---
That and it requires a LOT of co-ordination, something the average World Boss mob lacks.
---
&gt; Soul Grasp: (BUFF)--This skill is pretty great, though it is a competitive pick now, so it wasnt an outright buff to the class (which is a good move by ANet imo). To appreciate the skill you have to realize it competes with Dec Defenses, a free 50% crit trait in PvE that easily brings most people to perm-100% crit.
---
That is Soul Eater. Soul Grasp is Focus #4
---
Disclaimer: This event never took place. It's just a story I came up after hearing guildie's funny quote. 
---
Some phone art again and testing new tricks for drawing.
---
&gt;our intention is to remove the daily cap on **all** world meta event completion rewards
---
this sounds like a really iffy idea *or* they're gonna have to drive PoF rewards through the roof to not just have people farm HoT metas nonstop all week
---
Yes, and I know my profession and skills. I have a dire set stored in bank for 2 years...
---
Dire set will not make condi warrior kill mobs too slow becaue sword/torch/longbow are area condi spammer.
