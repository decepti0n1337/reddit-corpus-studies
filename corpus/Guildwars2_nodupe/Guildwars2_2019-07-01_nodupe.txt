Human male. Just hang out in the PvP lobby for a few minutes and you'll see many examples of death angels of all varieties.

it is pretty much a precursor, they trying to figure out how people react, if they get  matched with different languages, so they can think about, if it  is necessary to keep language differences in the alliance system. Or at least they want people to get slowly used to the multilingual wvw.
---

---
and since the server this patch was only 2 days ago, you may should just wait for 1 or 2 weeks and see what happens. a system that makes predicts player population cant do this with only the data of 2 days, because it would be totally easy to manipulate
---
Maybe “the gods” you mean is just the newest generation we know right now ( Balthazar, Lyssa and others) and is not “The Elder gods” I mentioned, truly the gods are not native, cause the possible “The Elder Gods” created the Tyria, our of their home, the mists.
---
Take the community with it, you can populate a low server and start a new community there and everyone can join all together, or you can just wait forever for anet to change anything, which will probably not happen.
---
Sometimes you just have to make a hard decision if you want something to be better.
---
Haha - Took a moment to work out what was going on.  Funny as hell. :-)

SnowCrows' website might help you.

Just do whatever is fun for you! Do you find dynamic events fun? Do that. World bosses or dungeons, map exploration, etc. So many ways to play the game and gain experience and the same time. If you are in a map and really are at a loss, ask in map chat or just type: /wiki \[insert map name\] to get more information on that specific map.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For example, [Kessex Hills](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kessex_Hills) has all this stuff you can check out. So look around maps for your race and others (you have waypoints for all race starter maps, btw), or the wiki if you are really confused. The GW2 wiki is really comprehensive and accurate, so make sure to take advantage.
---
I actually already have this song in my playlist so I am *Offended*, Good sir! Blessed be the Snoop.
---
Rivianer here... Can't complain. Before the link Riverside was half dead. Now it's fun, good coverage, lot of ppl... Seems some Germans who got a french link transferred to us :p
---
&gt; But as of now it's in a weird middle ground where it is not a dungeon organisation wise, but it's not challenging 
---
That is precisely what a tiered difficulty system would address. It's funny that you're so blind as to not see it. You want harder raids with the current system but anet is not gonna give them to you since they're sticking to their middle ground that doesn't please the casuals.nor the hardcore. Btw, they've said there wouldn't be a harder boss than Dhuum, so again, you're not gonna get harder stuff with the current system.
---
I don't mind you reporting the bug, I just don't care for your attitude. But nice try with the "if you dont like my post you most not play PvP", classy xD
---
&gt; a case of multi instancing
---
I would put money on it. Every time you do Urban you can pick one up if you haven't already. It should've been disabled once you finished the collection but like so many things it fell through the cracks. The real problem is players in this game will do anything to abuse/exploit mechanics if possible. First it was Aquatic now its Urban. Something else will pop up because that is what this community does.
---
You broke, foo &lt;3
---
Unless it's been changed it's capped per character. Just farm the coral with multiple characters and you'll have it in no time.
---
F
---
Would really love this
---
I feel like alot of that had to do with lack of consistant content over the last 1.5 years with no expansions.
---
The time to clear is so disingenuous. Please spend like 10 seconds imagining what w2 launch would have been like with the support scourge most of the progression groups for w7 were running. I'd guess cleared in 1 hour or less. 
---
The insane support builds we have access to now enable shoddy clears without having to master any of the mechanics. Air CM specifically kills your ressing speed to force mastery of the mechanics (that would down and leave you vulnerable to the red tornado) but nope just completely circumvented by support scourge.
---
The difficulty isn't easier than older wings, we just have crazy broken support builds now.
---
Thanks merf and the rest of our team for letting me tinker with this side project. It was always a goal of mine to work on a data viz heavy design like this was.
---
Hope someone is able to pick this up and keep it going for the community.
---
Race, weapons,fishing, boats, specs, woodland cascades!
---
I mean she's currently around and active so we don't need it anymore
---
That Zelda is impressive but the it looks more like Lunk then Link
---
I raid with one of the top 3 people by account value.
---
Yep my name is Bllue Hunter, if you ya know... want to change that
---
More repeatable instanced content, more maps, general stuff etc
---
Maybe a race with like a different personal story that starts in the expansion timeline and somehow leads to the character also becoming commander so they don't have to retrofit it into the entire base game and later stuff
---
But I trust arenanet, both expansions brought some stellar new stufd (especially mounts) so the main idea should be something new they will think of
---
Either Ethernet cable or move your router / modem into your room. The further you are from a WiFi spot the weaker / less reliable it is. Also make sure no one in your family / residence is using it at the same time as you.
---
Usually, it’s certain mobs are immune to certain conditions. For example, fire elementals are immune to burning, but they are not weak to water.
---
However, the destroyer mobs from LWS3 Episode 2 take more damage when chilled. But that’s the only thing I can think of close to that.
---
What are you talking about? First and last one are Zelda, the second done is Zelda's girlfriend.
---
You realize you're talking to a different person than the original comment right ? Tbh your attitude is even worse than theirs. Let people complain about things they're right to complain about.
---
There’s a large list of items that should no longer drop but continue to do so after completing their relevant collections and/or unlocking them.
---
Nice.
---
Its just humour bud.
---
A new character class (the first of three new ones). I suggest a mixture of ritualist and monk with light armor.
---
The second expansion could bring a paragon with heavy armor.
---
The third expansion offers a medium armor class then, to go full circle, maybe something like a bard-dervish mix.
---
more build diversity with more than 1 new elite spec for each class? :x
---
Very well done. It really goes to show that, as problematic a composer as Jeremy Soule can be, he really did a great job with the soundtracks for both Guild Wars games. I can't help but feel at times that something was lost when ANet started relying on in-house composers, particularly when I compare the music to that of FFXIV (winner of the "Best Music in an MMO" award in my book; Masayoshi Soken is an absolute wizard).
---
What’s funny is that I heard with wing 6, the CM’s were supposed to be the normal mode, but they thought that would be too hard for the average raider...  So they took out the Insta-Down mechanic from all three fights and called it normal mode.  Zzzzz...  Make you wonder what the original CM for w6 was going to be.
---
Definitely Norn. Their lore is dead since release.
---
Why a new class. Your just giving the devs more unnecessary work for a new class thats nine new elite specs plus multiple core specs for a the new class not to mention 3 full elite specs to make them balanced with the other classes. If elite specs weren't a thing it would be a good idea but its just too much work for the devs and something will likely suffer.
---
&gt;People are truly spoiled these days when it comes to story telling 
---
Well excuuuuse me for being "spoiled" by standards set in Guild Wars 1 for a game called Guild Wars 2.
---
It's blue zelda, girl zelda, green zelda. They are different.
---
This part made me cry. I did some research and on the wiki it claims that the drop rate is MUCH better in core tyria. So try mt maelstrom and orr and not the living worlds
---
A reputation system thats in the core game as well as HoT and PoF. A new race I think GW2 needs this
---
PSA: This happened to me a few times already. When it happens, I *form a party with my wife and then queue*. It works every time. You can leave the party after the match and queue solo and it will be back to normal (at least, until the bug happens again next). The downside of this is that the other person has to play that 1 match to help your issue. 
---
I heard the devs finally admitting this bug in the official forum. Apparently it was a rare bug that for some reason suddenly occurs much more frequently since about 2 weeks ago. The game thought you were still with your previous (computer-matched) PvP party, so it does nothing when you click the button, as if you're still in a match.  That would explain why forming a new party fixes it.
---
100 is normal on west coast but 140 is a bit high. You could try ethernet but don't expect major improvements because for some reason Anet moved servers from central US to VA...
---
If you need just HPs open up a guide, mount up and head off to the Crystal Desert, it will take a while but you'll be having an elite spec in no time
---
Can't wait to see the smoke machine and lazer projected hologram of the hand when you take it out.
---
Great, more anecdotal evidence. I got mine too: I have over a thousand LI's and I haven't spent any money in the gem store since HoT cause I don't like way the game is heading. I've also raided and know players with close to 2K Li's that don't feel like supporting anet due to the extremely slow cadence at which they release raids.
---
Hopefully you're able to figure out where this is heading and why you shouldn't present anecdotal evidence as facts.
---
I dont see names when I'm in raid with my squad, double check u have player name+npc name unchecked
---
Were you playing during meta rush week?    A lot of the times I tried to load in I ended up on a new map with the event not active.. and LFG was nothing but full maps.
---
Not sure "Competitive" is what Arenanets target market is tbh
---
Yes and I was able to join then.  It's not meta rush week anymore and maps are not as full as they were then.
---
I wonder if the engine can handle more gimmicks, it's already quite challenging to get the game running decently. If anything I'd love to see Anet make a new modern engine, and with a fresh new start and hopefully nice and clean coding we'll have a better looking and running game with a lot more possibilities!
---
Can I....have all the data? I'm genuinely serious. I'm a data hoarder and I'd love to preserve all of this. Comb through it, etc.
---
Thank you for creating and maintaining the website, for however long it lasted. It provided an invaluable tool of displaying averaged data, which is a much better way of measuring ones performance than comparing it to whatever numbers benchmarkers pulled out of their ass by abusing unintended mechanics and unrealistic scenarios, as long as the userbase stayed big enough to provide plenty of samples. The ability to view logs uploaded by someone else if you were a participant was also very helpful, and the historical archive of statistical data across every major game update was welcome too, albeit, I imagine, not seeing much use. Unfortunately I ended up not using GW2Raider for as long as I'd wish, primarily because dps.report was updating its parser much more frequently and that, in the end, overshadowed the convenience and features GW2Raidar provided.
---
Good luck with your future endeavors!
---
P.S. Are you really going to delete all the data? I can understand the logs, but the statistical data must compress really well.
---
It's because almost none of us actually play raids.
---
[removed]
---
Thank you to all the developers at GW2 Raidar. These projects are huge helps to the GW2 community and I hate to see more and more of them go with the players that built them. These are built out of pure passion and as long as that passion has the capacity to exist again (either in other games or the workplace) projects like this can crop up again but with even more experience backing it. 
---
Good luck in the future and we all hope to see your name(s) again!
---
Yay~~
---
Just stick with exotic Carrion and you're fine.
---
For ascended, I'd still recommend aiming for viper gear.
---
I will respect that you worked hard on the UI/UX. However the UI and UX designs of the current version that were made was one of, if not the primary, reason I stopped using Raidar. It made things way too laggy and broke too frequently when it was first introduced. Less is more and raidar failed me in this regard. I am not happy to see it go even if it was unusable to me.
---
&gt; The whole thing is just the result of people screaming for informations and a company who gave anything just to make those people stop crying.
---
Lmao, They don't tell us anything.
---
Maybe they should wonder why people are "Screaming for informations" in the first place?
---
We literally know the bare minimum, You don't see other MMOs having this as such a big issue.
---
Exactly. There's tons to do
---
A minion focused build really isn’t viable in group content. For fractals, the only kind of meta necro build is full berserker power reaper with wells and greatsword/axe+focus. For raids, condi scourge is great on certain rights, but it generally only runs 2 or 1 minions and only because no other skills are better. You definitely can’t run death magic in group content, the dps loss is too significant. Condi scourge runs scepter/torch and no other weapons. This build is effectively the only condi necro option, and it usually only runs 1 or 2 minions, depending on the fight.
---
While I agree with most of the others saying his story was dropped due to HoT's conclusion--I don't think his story HAS to end there.
---
He was said to only feel "A great sense of distance, and loss" so it is also possible that we may find out more in a future expansion if we cross the Unending Ocean.
---
Imagine Anet introducing a new continent (besides Tyria and Cantha) which has more Sylvari trees including Malyck's. T
---
Every game has this issue.  Because why work hard when you can work smart.
---
no dont take this away from me its all i have in life
---
W7 cms should have been the normal mode. They basicly only punish you for failing a mechanic. If you don't fail the mechanic in the first place you don't even notice the cm.
---
Fashion wars mainly :D
---
Thank you for all the work you put in.
---
Just don't let the first chest fake you out, there's much more to the puzzle ;-)
---
Bubbles confirmed.
---
Seriously, what a bewildering comment. "We want raids to be like the rest of the content in gw2 where you don't have to actually learn/try". Well fucking why? Why not do **literally anything else in this entire game**?
---
*I know your face from my violets.*
---
&gt; And you're gonna fix that by excluding them from raids altogether, am I right?
---
&gt; 
---
Yes, excluding players who are unwilling to put in even minimal effort would improve raids drastically lol. That would make it clear that the people interested in raids are interested in a challenge, not just another feel good piece of content where you don't have to do anything but sit there and get a bunch of rewards.
---
I've seen creatures of
---
Metal and Steam
---
This is what happens in Hoelbrak too. It lands on one of the great lodges. I’m guessing it’s from that
---
No they changed it.
---
I’ve been thinking about this for a while now.  Personally I’d like to see customisable weapon skills in the next expansion as the big feature for the next expansion.  I’d also like to see more underwater utility skills and improved racial skills.  
---
Last but not least, I’d like to land spears and scythes incorporated as a new polearm weapon type.  Apparently animations already exist for land spears, they’re not being used.
---
The thing you forgot to add for roller beetle: drifting.
---
Path of Memes?
---
Haha that's actually amusing xD Makes me wonder if they transfer away a again in 2 months if we end up getting an French link then xD
---
Now think that with these new classes devs will have 2 optiones: either don't give them any new elite specs, which will piss the community and the core classes will feel just how revenant felt for a few years due to herald. Besides it will feel blunt.
---
The other way is to do 3 classes and give them 2 elites, cause otherwise will be unfair that other classes have the elites. This basically makes the devs do at least 9 different specs (1 core+ 2 elites for each of them, 3)
---
I think what you really wanted to say is give to 3 of already existing classes an elite spec of what you said.
---
That's correct. It uses the same animation and pathing as in Hoelbrak. This means Kralkatorrik will land on air for a couple seconds before taking off, unless you position it correctly.
---
Wow, this made me realize how many tools of this game, or any game...I just take for granted.
---
Infinite thanks to you and your team, you helped me improve so much on my dps characters. 
---
Farewell and best of luck in future endeavors
---
Yes please! 🐉
---
I'm from Riverside and really enjoying our link with AG, it gave new life and blood to WvW. Besides some ignorant people who just keep communicating in German, all is working out fine.
---
-under water mount
---
-multi person mount/mounts
---
-some sort of mounted combat, which ideally would give us at least one raid boss utilizing mounted combat, and hopefully some metas
---
-a mastery that lets us mount up while in combat
---
-build templates
---
-spellslinger (pistol pistol ele)
---
I want to go for Rolling Ace myself.
---
That's not the picture it made for us... It was more... Horny.
---
Lol
---
alternatively you could make the defense events like a wave after wave system of increasing difficulty.  Most defenses probably get to like wave 2 or 3 then fail.  It could be a pretty cool community event to compete for the high score.
---
I was also kind of hoping the Pinatas would be around all maps, not just in Hoelbrak..  Maybe next year.
---
I didnt know Mark Zuckerberg played GW2
---
As long as it the Pinata gave a set amount per day.  Like 25 taffy, considering the candy corn node costs half that and gives around 10-15.
---
Because they literally say in their post they dislike having alts. Not that weird of a concept.
---
Support scourge isn't remotely meta or used by the world first teams that the person you're responding to is referencing.
---
I don't agree with the analysis that the raid was a flop because of the clear time, but even if you did think that this was a problem, it's... not because of support scourge. Support scourge does not fit in the 'world first team' composition.
---
W7 is definitely easier than W5, too, for what that's worse.
---
Alliances can't come soon enough.. tired of this fucking bandwagon server bs..
---
if you can allow for some twisting of the theme to make sense culturally, you could go for a valkyrie inspired look on your norn
---
Cantha, new Meta events with HoT Quality, new Elite Specs, Housing, new/reworked Dungeons that are actually lucrative, new Raids.
---
This would actually be sick, Archeage had some amazing content.
---
Yeah, I agree completely with your first point. After playing Oblivion / Skyrim for hundreds of hours and then GW2 in 2012, I almost instantly recognized his style and knew he was the composer for GW. But because I love his OSTs, I was really happy with that.
---
And that VR thing is really strange, I don't understand. Nothing wrong with VR, but why limit yourself to a single genre, especially one that is somewhat limited right now?
---
as others say, gw2timer.com, but they also have an overlay app called gw2navi. you can overlay it 2d as a map on your current game, or place it on a 2nd monitor (mines a 52 inch tv connected to the onboard video card) so you can display the map and its sidebar including all events in orange circles and crosses and boss icons, or follow the boss timer, or click on dailies that show you where to go on the map to get your dailies fast.
---
only problem with timer/navi is that it was abandoned after vabi map was released. season 4 is missing entirely. but for everything else before season 4, the app is perfect.
---
You can get them from the chests in dragonfall as well.
---
I can't think of a single game mode where a tenth of a second of delay is going to make or break anything.
---
It will not
---
While thief has fallen out of favor recently, and the better thief build is currently core thief with s/d, you can still run the typical d/p daredevil build and get good results. The build is:
---
Dagger/Pistol + Shortbow
---
Energy and cleansing sigils on shortbow
---
Trickery 3-1-2
---
Deadly Arts 2-2-2 (can also run 2-2-3 if enemy team has no mesmers)
---
Daredevil 1-3-3
---
Marauders amulet, scholar rune
---
Build is pretty much the same for wvw honestly. It’s not a 1v1 build, it’s actually not very good at fighting at all. The reason you take it is for the insane mobility and +1 potential. In pvp, your job would be to rotate around the map, decapping enemy points (not capping, mostly just decapping) and turning 1v1 fights into 2v1s, or 3v3s into 4v3s, winning the fight, and then leaving to another point.
---
Dagger/pistol daredevil was a good sPvP build since HoT release. Sometimes it was top tier, sometimes tier 1-2, but always playable anyway. You just run around the map, quickly helping your allies with unexpected assassination and capping points. Usually it's Dagger/pistol + shortbow, marauder amulet, scholar rune, dardevil, trickery and deadly arts traitlines and for skills it's signet of agility, shadowstep and some optional thing. Elite is daredevil one. In general, avoid direct combat and concentrate on points utilizing daredevil's high mobility and stealth.
---
Rich vs broke...I’m broke btw

It's all I could think of that was good for farming gold and repeatable.

How much lifesteal do foods steal? I can't find a specific percent in the wiki for foods, for example a food that lifesteal on critical hit chance, how much life will it steal?

For[Scoop of Mintberry Swirl Ice Cream
---
](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scoop_of_Mintberry_Swirl_Ice_Cream), wiki says (at the very bottom):
---
&gt;Steals 325 health from a level 80 opponent. The heal is not affected by Healing Power or any other stat.
---
I would go on a wild guess and say that it is roughly the same for every other life steal food but considering we are talking about GW2 I would be a bit cautious :p
---
Yea but guardian at least gets good heals, while thief has shit ones. Idk, maybe im building it wrong, but if my heal is down, ill probably just die
---
Hm?  It does seem quite clear that Mordremoth did communicate with Scarlet. Especially considering that other Sylvari can hear him in their mind as well when venturing into the Jungle.
---
You're very much incorrect. Via Omadd's Machine, Scarlet touched Mordremoth's mind and after that, Mordremoth spent a couple years digging into Scarlet's mind and implanting thoughts (the same thing he does to all other sylvari at the beginning of HoT).
---
It's covered in these links:

---
He implanted thoughts into her mind, making her think they were her own thoughts. At first, Scarlet had the intention of confronting Mordremoth and "learn more" / "putting an end to this madness". It's unclear whether she had intended to fight Mordremoth, or just learn more about it. But as the plans nearly came to fruition, Mordremoth began to drop the pretenses of subtlety in her mind, and it became clear that all her actions inevitably led to empowering Mordremoth rather than allowing Scarlet to learn from/confront him.
---
Oh dear. The idea of easier difficulties is to give a more accessible stepping stone that familiarises players with the encounters and the mechanics so that they can progress to a more challenging difficulty. They also have the nice knock on effect of letting game designers make the hard content truly hard.
---
Your supposition that W4 and W7 are the easy modes totally fails because they can't act as a stepping stone for the "normal" difficulties which, by implication, are other raid wings with very different mechanics.
---
in fact it is the issue of the game-mode, there are weird other issues too....  
---
often when fighting more than 2 or 3 players a quick succession of skills that damages you does knock out your skillbar, its about a 2sec window, or 1,1/4 window where no skills are even available to press.... so? not even a chance of a response, usually players take advantage of these burst windows of opportuinty too much in pvp....i think some map design needs to be tighter,  specifically maybe smaller maps, with more terrain/spacing/height difference instead of the flatter maps which don't work as well....also i strongly feel the 12 second cooldown on death needs to be changed to about an 9 second cooldown...

I'd always try to sell at sell price and you can check places like [GW2BLTC](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/8887-Powerful-Potion-of-Inquest-Slaying), [GW2Spidy](https://www.gw2spidy.com/item/8887) and [GW2TP](https://www.gw2tp.com/item/8887-powerful-potion-of-inquest-slaying) for more details. They do sell daily for the popular potions but you're gonna have issues selling them if you try to flood the supply.
---
Your traits, utilities and runes also make a significant part of your build, and while we can't see that, I'll comment on what we can see.
---
* You mention that all your gear is berserkers, but it looks like a lot of pieces are the standard basic skin. If these are exotics and you've just transmuted over them for the particular look of your character, then that's fine. If those pieces are just the basic white gear, then you should definitely upgrade them to exotics.
---
* If you are looking to mainly deal power damage, longbow is okay for long range, and I know a lot of rangers like to use it because they like the aesthetic, but be aware that its damage is lacklustre (for pve purposes). If you are fighting more than one enemy at once, it will not be of much use. In your other set, offhand dagger doesn't really do anything for you. An axe would be much better. For high level content, power soulbeasts typically bring a greatsword and dagger/axe. For open world, you can keep the longbow if you like, but I'd suggest swapping out the d/d for one of those other two sets.
---
* You have a bunch of extra toughness and vitality from stats. Ultimately, these don't benefit you that much, when you consider how much you lose in terms of offense. You might be able to survive 2 or 3 more hits, but that doesn't count for much when the mobs stay alive long enough to hit you 5-10 more times than they would have if you killed them faster. I would suggest replacing any gear you have with toughness or vitality on it with exotic berserkers, and if you have trouble living, use some defensive traits or utilities until you reach the point where you're more comfortable in glass gear. Signet of stone, and the trait (idk the name) that auto procs signet of stone, are good examples of this. I believe there's also a pet that gives a similar ability when merged, but i'm not sure which one that is.
---
Ultimately, it's not a case of you not having ENOUGH stats, assuming all your gear is exotic. It's a case of having ineffective/non-synergistic stats and equipment. It's a learning process to play glassy everwhere, but it will generally work out better in the long run.
---
&gt; Especially considering that other Sylvari can hear him in their mind as well when venturing into the Jungle.

That's sleeping dragon vs 2 years awake dragon
---
Get lost, Kormir.
---
Oh she actually did it the absolute mad lass.
---
I don't think that any Elder dragon was genuinely evil.
---
Elder Dragons are so damn powerful and massive that they just don't see us, the lowlifes, as a threat. I mean, we also feel superior to Insects, right?! They are alive for such a long time and repeated the almost never ending cycle over and over with always the same outcome, them waking up, consuming magic and going back to sleep again without them having any problems on doing so.
---
Another thing is, why should you do all the work if your lieutenants and minions could do the work instead?!
---
I see the Elder Dragons more as arrogant, they know they are that powerful and probably think that the other Elder Dragons are also powerful but not as powerful as they are (typical "bad guy" behaviour).
---
Which means, the elder dragons don't concern themselves with when they should wake up but only when is the best time for them to wake up so that they can have breakfast.
---
The Difference between Zhaitan and Mordremoth was their state they were in. Zhaitan wakes up in 1219AE and Orr Rises and Mordremoth, on the other hand, only wakes up because he uses Scarlet to disrupt the Ley-line which then sends a shockwave to Mordremoth.
---
The Pale tree is the barrier to the Dream and Mordremoth but this barrier seems to be bypassed when Ceara used Omadd's Machine and saw the eternal alchemy.
---
The thing is, The elder Dragons are different, Primordus, Jormag, Zhaitan and Kralkatorrik all have their own body but it is said that Mordremoths Body is the entire Maguuma Jungle and those Vines are just appendages that he can use to get more magic for himself.
---
In case of the ley-lines. This is probably a combination of two things, the natural flow of magic through the world and the location of elder Dragons. The elder Dragons emit the magic over time and the sheer amount of magic that is seeping out of their bodies will have an effect on the ley-lines which would shift to connect other ley-line hubs.
---
What we know so far is that a lot of magic makes you go mad, this rule also seems to apply to Elder Dragons. We don't know how old the Elder Dragons are and if this effect reverses itself over time (with low amount of magic) or if it is a lasting effect. I mean, we almost went mad but were purged and don't seem to have any problems anymore.
---
Another thing is that Mordremoth was fundamentally different than the other elder dragons, he was the elder dragon and master of the mind so keeping his "cool" would make sense and he didn't had his own body as the other elder dragons which means he could have discarded the things affected by the madness and prolonging or purging himself each time of the madness.
---
In the fight against Mordremoth you only really see how arrogant he is, You killed an elder dragon already and killed his mouth and invaded his mind and he is still baiting you with the utter destruction of Tyria when he is killed. He is so arrogant that, until his last moment, he doesn't see himself being defeated by mere insects.
---
&gt; What if he has power, despite being dead, and uses it to screw with dragons who embraced his "mind powers" for their own gains.
---
I don't think so, what is shared are the aspects of magical spectrum (so Primordus minions gaining death magic because of Zhaitan death) but not the "mind" or anything itself. This is also pretty clear since we killed Trahearne so that Mordremoth can't escape and is gone for good.
---
I think the amount of magic is the reason for this as it affected us in the current events.
---
In none of this links there is evidence Mordremoth ever talked to Scarlet, let alone make her do anything
---
i was playing on best appearence gfx setting all 100% of the time playing, with 1080p and effect lod unchecked...., just made the switch to this dx12 and indeed its beautiful and there no way i can return.... you should try  this dx12  its been worth it for me. oh yeea @:)

Drooburt converts it directly into gold during New Year, see https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Essence_of_Luck#Usage

The conversion takes a lot of dialogue clicking though.
---
I can assure you that everyone from the german spekaing part of europe knows about knut since he was born in berlin.
---
The media hyped everything about him up to a giant scale. after a while it got very annoying lol.
---
I really would like to see Anet address these types of issues before hoards of players just leave the  game mode or game entirely.  I don't think it's easy to bring back players that left. From what I know these servers are ancient compared to the ones on the new living worlds. Even worse these servers run on directx 9(and the rest of the game)  instead of directx 12. Making zergs lag severely in fights even with a $2000+ PC.
---
Who the hell is Avex Inc and why did they copyright strike your video?
---
all EDs use a champion to awaken them and a disaster that happens upon their awakening, mordremoth is not special in any way when it comes to that. (and the drill dident upset the balance of magic it redirected leylines towards mordremoth, and yes, those are 2 diffrent things) see the great destroyer, Drakkar
---
given that he was the dragon of mind mordremoth was probably more aware of the threath the pact formed to the EDs then others and aware of internal politics and moved in a more tactical way compared to other EDs.
---
and the other EDs were expanding primordus has expanded at least from the tengu city to the shiverpeaks to mount mealstrome while he himself was further up north, mordremoth was just more agressive towards us in it's expansion (kralk was had his fight with glint so it makes sense he didn't move for a while and we don't know if his movement was caused by him "going mad") 
---
all in all i'd say mordremoth was about as evil as the other dragons
---
Well if there wasn't a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1145285852756619271) from u/that_shaman yesterday, where he found a new character portrait overlay with a similiar [symbol](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D-TIfvnWkAA3e_7.png), I would say it's nothing.
---
That I remember that tweet, I understand what you mean...
---
I see you're playing on your main. Gratz. What is it tho, a DH?
---
The higher your magic find is the more like you will get of a higher tier loot. Which means that, the higher your magic find is the more likely it is for you to get higher tier loot and this applies to your whole account. That, unfortunately, means that the increased supply of higher tier loot will decrease the price in the TP. Lower tier loot will get rarer and more expensive which will make it harder for players to get those items for crafting.
---
What we need are more sinks to spend the Magic find when we reach the cap. An item like mawdrey would be a good start or additional crafting recipes or just a vendor that sells something all year round.
---
But it does give a very big hint to the complexity of the content. Players in this game don't want gear progression, they want more mental stimulation. Problem solving.
---
Or even add LI/LD to them that are separate from the regular version

if a would have stopped playing this game half a year ago, this would have been the final nail in the coffin for me.
---
thanks a lot for your hard work! you made data comparison unbelievable enjoyable.
---
Didn't use Raidar too much, but that is just an indicator to how close this raiding community is to be fully dead.  
---
Imagine the guy who does ArcDps feels the same and stops working on it. Of course some will argue that ArcDps did nothin but harm to the game, in fact i think most of the more experienced raiders would have stopped without a long long time ago.
---
Aren't they? They're of the same kind as the ones seen in fort trinity and the ones in fort trinity were powered up by the orb, since the orb acts as a repellent for elder dragon minions. In fact, some of them have the same exact textures as the ones in fort trinity.

Kite with longbow.
---
&gt; I had to run a lot to survive lol
---
I mean that is a normal tactic for killing stuff. Most open world mobs you can just facetank but when you get to tougher enemies you need to run/dodge/kite/juggle aggro with pet. You do anything and everything to survive if you need to.
---
I fear you are right. GW2 revenue is reaching Aion levels and has higher operating costs. It seems like they are going for a lot of content that can be automated, and turned off and on every year like festivals, no downstate week in pvp e.t.c. Sort of like a semi maintenance mode.
---
You willl get downvoted though as there is a sort of blindness to it from people. The group thought on it is that ANET will now have more resources for GW2 and things are looking good. If there is an expansion announced soon I will eat my words.
---
Fair enough, the numbers confuse me tbh. I just go by how many of which type of gear I have or use metabuild or snowcrows lol!
---
Project is already [open source](https://github.com/GW2Raidar/gw2raidar) (the link is in the footer at the very bottom of Raidar page).

Well done! It's awesome you did make a tutorial for it to share it! I am more into griffon than beetle but this vid is awesome.  :D I will link it to a friend who loves to do beetle races. Thx a lot!
---
Do you have any references to share, please?
---
Build templates
---
I wasn't bashing at the guy, I made an allusion to how people use 'eugh you must be underage' out context to feel superior. Do you need people to spell it out?
---
Ajrdesign aint dead as far as I know, so my point still stands. Unless you are implying that the project itself has feelings :P
---
Would be nice if I had more than one healing skill though lmao
---
&gt; In either case, it makes it interesting to speculate what that means for Season 5
---
That it'll be 5-7 months until we see anything of it. Sorry, had to :P
---
It's not just about stats, it equally (if not more) has to do with your build and skill. If you're insisting on running Longbow, you can run something like [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vNAQJATRnE8CN8id8CuCCctgl8AL/9Wf7vP1hlQGYJAUAWblY+3A-jhCBAB5prpvDEAEHQhAOCAVq+zZKBB4SAwwDIoo9HwS5XAAEgbezs5NDczbezbezbWbezbezbezbezbezSBonyI-e) \- keep in mind that this is an OPEN WORLD PVE BUILD, it's not for raids/fractals/wvw/pvp; you will need appropriate builds for that. Anyways, you can run Axe/Axe, Sword/Axe, Axe/Warhorn, Sword/Warhorn instead of either Longbow or Greatsword; personally I would keep the Greatsword (and Axe/Axe is great instead of Longbow because you still get some ranged damage and you get more Might). You can run full Marauder's accessories if you feel like you need more  survivability but I don't think there's any need for that. Get Jacaranda.
---
well it is, for the economy as I have pointed out after that. If course it will take a long time but it is just a progressing things and anyone will get there eventually. You won't be able to get back though.
---
IMO it isn't such a good idea because all of those higher tier drops will lose their value because more and more players will get them over time while lower tier drops well get rarer and increase in value.
---
IMO 300% is enough and already takes a long time to get there, I mean I play this game since it released and have almost 35k AP and only have like 276% and I am probably far above the average player.
---
That is why I am more for sinks instead of increasing the cap. Players get something out of it and, in the long run, the economy will not wreck itself just because players have an even higher magic find than now.
---
No. Being disappointed makes you whiny entitled elitists because this game is for casual play and wvw was always an afterthought!!!!
---
Curiously enough back when I was into raiding big time (a bit in EQ1, then a lot in DAoC and 8 years an active raid leader in WoW, weekly), none of the "big raid building" was done with **any** difficulty levels.
---
That's not to say they're not beneficial. Don't get me wrong. But I fail to see them as a "required" feature. In fact, having tougher stopgaps in your raids is usually what serves as a good basis for community building as a guild has a common enemy to work towards bringing down.
---
I’m saying that posting critism when the dev thanks his fellow collegues is ”in the wrong time”. It’s valuable critism but not really the right place for it there

Every comment on this thread is just gold. Also to for the nightmares.

Stop paying because anet is milking us for money without delivering much in the last 5+ years. Just squandering away their IP and their resources due to bad management and negligence.
---
I know that Anet stayed otherwise but they've just needed to establish that one of the Blighted Trees (for example in Verdant Brink) is Malycks. 
---
Add a boss plus hints (maybe some dialog when character is Sylvari) that's corrupted Malyck and that's all.
---
It's better to have a simple closure than no closure at all.
---
Their actions accelerated the decay of the gamemode. Which is sad considering how rare any actions are.
---
Then they should ask for a better and more complex combat system and party/group interaction on a class level, so there's **room** for more complex raid fights.
---
Sure, but where is the suggestion that Scarlet was just imagining the voice in her head? Especially since said voice quite clearly did lead to redirecting the Leyline to Mordremoth.
---
Drakkar was also very much asleep and yet it still managed to have quite some effect on Svanir.
---
Actually found that [Omnomberry Ghost](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Omnomberry_Ghost) lists both the hit and the heal! I went and temporarily added them to the [life steal page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Life_stealing) though I may end up moving the values into the non-skill section since I don't really like the look of it.
---
See? Exactly, this already more than pleases even the semi-casual players. The way it is now, there is *already enough* relevant raids for new players to see some potential endgame, and 7+ months for ANet is also fine because raids still come out every now and then so people can't really say they "got rid of raids".
---
Hardcore players? Hell no. "Too few", "too easy" and all the other complaints. GW2 is not WoW where the majority of people were supposed to raid, and it *doesn't have to be* because that's not the target audience. So that's not a "mistake" that we only get few, easy raids released - it's a design decision.
---
Then again why play **the** ultra-casual MMORPG if you don't want ultra-casual content? ;)
---
Actually nm, found the citation myself from their news feed. Then again the same article calls GW2 out on its "groundbreaking combat system", so I'm not exactly certain whether the person who wrote that for the web page knew anything about what they were writing about.
---
This so much. I loved farming sunspear / lightbringer etc in the original game
---
This is correct.
---
more precisely the animation seems to be direction locked, regardless of how you turn the actual decoration. he will briefly land in the west, and hover for a moment in the east.
---
Piken is a server that struggles if they dont significantly outnumber their opposition. It's no surprise they consider themselves "not full" and disadvantaged.
---
How does magic find work? Do you just get loot more often from mobs or better loot? Also which containers are affected? does it also affect salvaging and drops like ascended chests from fractals?
---
Doing some little bits of indie game dev here. I'm also a fellow data fetishist. You guys need storage space for the data I've got no problem making that happen. Data storge is cheap and i don't use much space.
---
&gt; Can I....have all the data? I'm genuinely serious. I'm a data hoarder and I'd love to preserve all of this. Comb through it, etc.
---
This comment is one of the reasons I never liked Raidar. Happy it's gone.
---
First thing you need to accept - you are running a non-meta build and are not as skilled at the game, so you won't reach the big numbers that you see people in fractal builds do. It's ok - I also have some toons in sub-optimal builds for fun. (When in open world my raid-ready daredevil switches to shortbow and I have a reaper that runs a stupid ice build just for the fashion...)  
---
Start with going full zerker for your armor and weapons. Any non-damage stats won't help you when you have 10 enemies on you.   
---
Also consider is your runes and sigils.  
---
For runes, I'd say to stay away from scholar for now.  
---
From a quick look at common builds I can see superior rune of vampirism or rune of thief as options. Start with vampirism for sustain (its also dirt cheap). Once you feel more comfortable switch to thief runes(or whatever other damage rune you want then)   
---
For sigils - bloodlust, accuracy or blood are nice. Remember my SB daredevil? I run sigil of luck(gain boon on kill) and sigil of generosity(transfer condition on crit), which feels really nice especially when facing a lot of enemies.  
---
You mentioned struggling against white mantle in S3...the only toon I try to mindlessly solo them with is my chaos mirage...Condi is easier against them than power. so don't feel bad lol. 😹  
---
Tl;dr - Have fun, and may the odds be ever in your favour 😛
---
it's a shame... the mmo with one of the best combat systems is not catering raiders.
---
even tho i think it is not just their release schedule of raids what bothers most ppl. it is more about the lack of a meaningful reward structure.
---
the community in this game apparently just feels entitled to have everything by just login in
---
This, I rather choose to turn off other player's effects rather than nerfing the visual effect of my character, especially after the introduction of scourge so many area of effects ring thanks to his sand shade, how I miss the old gw2 before the visual noise update.
---
can confirm, squad name can only be hidden on raid instance.
---
Those players name also eating up your fps, when I leave the 50 squad members I regain like 10 fps.
---
Which server I jumped to and played on went to the bottom? Please do tell. Or you mean servers seem to crash and burn the moment a core of players leaves? 
---
Ros started t5, went up, dropped straight back to t5 when a small group left. Vabbi was the same and went up from t5 several times.

A bit of dragon bash trivia for you.
---
They sold coffers during the first bash in the gem store. They were advertised to drop recipes on occasion. I bought a bunch and never found any. Nor did any friends. Long story short, they weren't in the drop table. I notified support and they admitted to not having it in there. instead of fixing it, they just gave everyone the recipe who bought coffers from the gem store. This recipe is known as the dragon revelry starcake recipe. That was the only way to get it. You're welcome everyone 😉😁
---
why is it resource intensive? you just need the dragon minion contained on the altar
---
Wel,l you can play druid.
---
very accurate screaming
---
Isn't that mostly focused on healing?
---
On Thief you have a Heal Skill that grants passive Health regen on every Hit. In your Trickery ...? (I'm not sure pliz check yourself) or other Traitlines you have a Passive Trait that heals for 10% of damage done and 20% damage done while Fury boon is active.
---
Guardian has something similar too, you heal for each attack with your Greatsword - also your passive Virtue heals every few seconds.
---
Oddly enough a Guardians self sustain is not about self healing but blocking incoming hits with their Aegis involunerability and several different Blocks from their Weapon sets.
---
Thiefes, if played right have way more selfhealing incombat compared to Guardians - they're on pair with Necromancers for selfsustain but apply double the damage at the same time. Recently Raidwing7 got released and at the Endboss Encounter bringing Rifle Deadeyes is way more effective than bringing Necros to tank those Pylons.
---
If you choose to heal as a Firebrand(Guardian Elite) you have not really and self healing like you know from other classes, everyone can heal themselfes for about 6-8k HP but Guardians can't. You need to stand in your own outward healing skills and get hit by them because you lack any meaningfull selfhealing to begin with. Its important to know that - if you only focus on healing others you won't really heal yourself and also can't do so if needed, so in Fractal (CMs or regular T4s) you need to check your own HP pool as well as others.
---
Anet could pull a Digital Extrem tennogen and compensate people for their work.
---
You can still play a very offensive druid if you equip them with berserker's gear. You will do less damage that with the soulbeast but you will have what you are asking for, more healing skills.
---
And this affects every "full" server in the same way. They have guildies on linked server who can't transfer to the main server, and the way Anet set up current system, on every relink there will be 3 main servers without a link, and everyone will get screwed in the same manner regardless how good or bad they are at ppt or kill.s
---
Just one thing.
---
An actual 3rd expansion. 
---
ArenaNet's design choices are more often hits than misses. So I can trust them to deliver a quality product.
---
Nice-to-have:
---
\- Learning from past lessons but not overly course-correct.
---
\- Longer story campaign.
---
\- Less Commander-centric storytelling, more fly-on-the-wall experience so we can have more compelling character development from obviously talented writers at ArenaNet. I think the backlash against Trahearne was due to poor set up of expectations. The narrative was building up to the Commander being the one who brings the Pact together, the dragon slayer and the savior of the world but ended up playing 2nd fiddle to Trahearne. If this time round, the main focus is clear right from the start, I think GW2 can have a story campaign that more clearly up with the talent the studio has.
---
\- Greatly scale up the difficulty of story instance fights and Dragon's Watch members' impact on the battle. This will ensure instances still can be completed in single-player while allowing the previous point to be feasible.
---
Yeah Scholar is too expensive so I use that, really good alternative tbh
---
?
---
Yeah it's a shame. But honestly I think the bigger shame is the raid bosses in general. For some reason they just were never that interesting. They sort of feel more like puzzles than bosses. Now Lupicus, that was a boss
---
Maybe elites in lw5 no expandion though
---
We don't know, only that "LWS5 will have stuff we'd normally expect in an expansion"
---
"The older your account is the more you will likely have". It looks like an almost obvious afirmation and it partly is but the reason is not because you have played more time but because of birthday presents. One birthday on one characters means one free level up scroll, from level 20 to level 60 depending on age (and lets see what will happen on August this year). Those scrolls complemented with a few level tomes means easy auto-max level. The only real limitation is the number of character slots you have.
---
Those level-up scrolls keep piling up the more characters you have and since you cannot transform them into those shard thinguies the only use for them besides the "intended use" is to use them for the weekly key farming thing.
---
By the way, is skill lag a thing on NA servers? It was horrendous on EU servers in 2014 and I must say nothing changed much.

If you gave someone constructive relationship criticism on their divorce announcement, how do you think people would respond?

If you gave constructive criticism on how to avoid getting into a car accident on someone's Facebook post in hospital after their car accident, how do you think people would respond?
---
There's a time and a place for things, and this is not it.
---
well, the real reason was not really that. There are/were 2 main reasons:
---
1- Achievements, completing collection parts etc. Shouldn't be an issue now but in the past only the last event of the capture meta would count and not the defense, but most if not all of them have been addressed by now so defense events give credit too.
---
2- It's more lucrative to run a capture meta than a defense event. Probably not a big issue these days since there are better meta events in the game to get gold, but it used to be a big point in the past before silverwates was introduced.
---
WHAT? the guy from Critical Role actually voices Arkk?
---
...How did I miss this?
---
Personally, I'm not a fan of classifying Firebrands and Scourges as strong raw output healers. They aren't comparable to either Staff Tempest or Scrapper for raw healing (even if that doesn't really matter since overhealing is the norm).
---
Gw2 always respected your play time so you can do whatever you want, whenever you want it (when it comes to solo content). There was never need to rush certain content.
---
We dont know what you enjoy doing so it doesnt hurt to try the game again and see how it goes.
---
To my (admittedly limited) understanding:
---
Support Chrono will be *the* hardest build in the game to get into as a pure DPS player. You'll be expected to tank some fights (and have to carry different sets to allow for swapping into enough toughness to be recognized as the tank for those fights), keep your buffs up while avoiding damage, and often have to do a lot of fight-specific mechanics that other roles just don't do. That being said, it's insanely good and always in demand, so the learning curve and difficulty is arguably well worth going through, since if you get good at Chrono, you'll basically never have to worry about your spot in a group.
---
Druid is fairly easy, but different to any other role since you're a pure buffer/healer, so there will still be some adjusting from being attack-focused to heal-focused. Honestly, it seems a bit boring to me, but to each their own. Every group needs at least a Druid or two, and you can always swap out to your Soulbeast if the group doesn't need support, so it's a solid pick.
---
Firebrand and Renegade are both pretty simple. Firebrand is more of a Condi DPS with Quickness as a solid side bonus, even in a support build, so it will be a very easy transition from pure DPS. Renegade is more focused on putting out their buffs, and each legend swap is a question of "am I buffing this round, or can I unload my damage?"
---
Heal Scourge has its place, and being able to pull and res people can be helpful, but it's less of a support and more of a barrier and regen bot, which has limited usefulness. It can help, especially in inexperienced groups, but it's not really a desired role in most fights, since a Druid will be carrying most of the healing anyway.
---
So, in summary: Scourge isn't a great pick for general support since it has one very specific niche that has limited usefulness in most raids and fractals, but if you like the playstyle, it has its place. Druid is fairly easy to get into if you don't mind being more of a healer than a support, and always needed. Firebrand is probably going to be the easiest transition since it plays similarly to a Condi DPS build, but provides really valuable buffs. Renegade is a bit of an oddball, you'll be splitting your time between a "buff rotation" and a "damage rotation" depending on what the cooldown on your buff skill looks like when you swap legends. And Chrono is by far the hardest Support to learn, but arguably by far the most worthwhile and rewarding, since good Chronos are invaluable to a team.
---
Also, Chrono is really the only one that will use a shield. Firebrand can, but they don't get much use out of it, so it's not meta by any means. So ultimately, if you don't mind the challenge, I'd recommend Chrono.

&gt;Druid is generally a more versatile and accepted support for both standard T4s \[...\]
---
A firebrigade is both more versatile and accepted in fractals since the nerf of GoE (and was already the preferred comp for the more optimized groups).
---
But since druid has been meta for so long, it is true that casual pug fractals still occasionally look for druids.
---
Don't worry about that for now. Once new season lands, we will know way more. Give it a time until august, I bet there will be a lot of stuff then.

To be fair a lot of this data could be anonymized and I think that could reduce a lot of the issues (given that you can already only appear in Raidar if you chose to). For this kind of data I don't think anyone will really care to see if the person that was the DH in this log was also the Druid in this other one, bigger tendencies and overall statistics are the interesting parts.
---
Tengu playable race and cantha
---
I really, REALLY like that idea of Kralkatorrik's torment being Mordremoths influence. It makes the dragons feel all the more connected and it makes sense if Mordremoth really was just a pure evil character. 
---
Alternatively, maybe Mordremoth WASN'T pure evil. Maybe he's sort of like Thanos in that he's doing something drastically bad for a greater good. Maybe he was corrupting the world to preserve it in some way. After he died he found himself within Kralkatorrik (somewhat) and influenced him to do the same for the same goal.
---
But this is my 'I-havnt-played-for-a-while-and-have-not-revised-the-lore' mind so maybe I'm missing something big which blows this theory out.

Yeah sure they heal not as mugh but are compareable enough, also their toolkit makes them way more appealing since proactive healer gameplay is top, nothing could make healing better - sitting around afk waiting for a team to get damage sucks... especially if you have a good group who actually know how to dodge.
---
Scourge healing is way lower but its Barrier and rezz potential is insane, you can increase groups ehp by 50% to just facetank mechanics.
---
Healbrand can prevent so much by Aegis, Stab and Reflect your DDs dps gets increased a lot since they don't need to play mechanics at all and can't get CC'd.
---
Sadly a "firebrigade" is not one player and therefore this advice is irrelevant. If the poster was stating that they had a friendly renegade to bring with them, it might be valid.
---
My point was also addressing both raids and fractals (which the OP asks about) and, considering both, the druid will be more versatile and accepted.
---
That's the point. They're EVERYWHERE.
---
They aren't good starter classes though since they only carry if the FB and Scourge are themselves very aware of the mechanics they are up against and their role.
---
The best "starter" healer for raids is probably a magi tempest using a straight staff healing build or a modified one for some boon share with extra harrier gear.
---
For fractals, it is debatable if it is FB, ren or druid. For the former two, the issue for a starter is that they might be paired with a firebrigade partner with the "wrong" gear (e.g. Two healers when the group wants one). They are also both reliant on knowing encounters for proactive stability and aegis (FB) and correct timing for legends and Soulcleave's Summit for Ren. For Druid, you can still slot in with a dps Ren, dps FB or a chrono so a wider chance of getting a party that works.
---
Best starter healer for both modes? Druid. Plenty of groups still want a druid in fractals and raids always want a druid. You can also still run double druids in raids successfully so you aren't just fighting for the one spot. 
---
I agree that learning on DPS is probably best but the OP was asking for advice on picking between an FB and a druid and I'd definitely recommend the latter (despite my own preferred healer being Renegade).
---
Stirring, not sleeping.
---
"Stirring" is a state in which dragons are not fully awake, but their minions will go out and prepare things for their awakening.
---
When the Great Destroyer flooded the asura gate system with destroyers, after defeating the Great Destroyer, the ending cinematic shows his eyes opening, showing that he was not asleep, but his body didn't move, showing he was not fully awake either. He was in his stirring stage, and the destruction of the great destroyer kept him from moving further than that stage for a long time.
---
Zhaitan and Jormag also showed sings of stirring before awakening, but Kralkatorrik just took off and flew south all of a sudden, seemingly skipping the stirring stage.  
---
My guess is that he has learned to find leylines, and when he goes to sleep he puts his head straight into a leyline confluence. And when he was interred in the charr homelands, all he had to do was opening his mouth and suck some magic in to get the initial energy to take off, so he didn't need his minions to take any action before awakening.  
---
He may be so good at it that he may had time to control his fall with his remaining wing and aim his head into a leyline confluence when he fell off the mists. 3 ley lines right in front of his head right where he fell is a plausible coincidence, but some control over where he dug his head is more likely.
---
But if you are druid in fractals you also need a chrono. By firebrigade I mean either of them as both see usage as healer or dpsing support, which gives them a lot of flexibility as they can be used with more varied team comps, whereas if you are a druid druid, there are no other alternatives than bringing a chono.
---
Moreover, I'm not responding to OP, i'm just commenting your statement about fractals.
---
But even if we extend it to raids, since GoE nerf, druids are still relevant for only on 3-4 encounters nowadays (but still quite common in pugs indeed).
---
well, the issue was that many people have mindset of "gib all asap or it sucks" and "new release -&gt; play for week -&gt; scream on forums that there is no content for next 3 months -&gt; scream on forums that they are missing map currencies because they did not played the content more than a week at release"
---
But ye, you have a freedom. Oddly, this game is freedom even without quitting, just need to switch from "need it all asap" to "let's enjoy it"....but that's probably me being too idealist.
---
if you don't live close to one of the server hosts, then yes. i've gotten used to it but i can still notice input delay because i have to play on NA servers when i'm in oceania. it rules out any type of competitive play if i was interested in that type of thing.
---
Yeah. I know that gw2 players got some kind of the stockholm syndrome :/ And like to lie themselves. But every mmo player which looks at it from a distance knows very well what's real state of this game. And avoids it. ArenaNet is scam company
---
Spot on! The programs that runs on the GPU are called "Shaders" and what ReShade does is replace (and/or add to) the ones shipped with the game with community made ones.  
---
If anyone is curious about what shaders can do: [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/results?query=&amp;sort=popular)
---
Hate to break it to you, but even \*with\* extra healers, a lot of teams fail. Why? Mechanical failures. Throwing more healers at a fight doesn't always make it easier. A lot of times it makes it harder by drawing out the fight due to lack of dps.
---
sorry but GW2 doesn't even come close to the best combat system. it lacks far too much depth. if they kept and made the combo system of  fields + finishers, maybe it'd come close, and ultimately boils down to targeting and casting skills much of the time. 
---
looking at any other MMO dicussion - such as on the /r/MMORPG subreddit - GW2 *doesn't even come close* to the likes of ESO, BDO, BnS and Vindictus in many people's opinions. so to combine subjectivity of other people's opinions with my oen, and then further comparing it to single player games - sorry. **GW2 doesn't even come close.** and this is, to most people, even those that have played GW2, true. or else you would see way more saying GW2 had the best combat outside the echo chamber of this subreddit. 
---
in PvE it's literally just having 3-4 roles that spam boons and other buffs for your party, the rest of whom do dps. compositions are incredibly stagnant, roles are stagnant, bosses are stagnant, the meta is stagnant, there's no room for anything new, and the vast majority of raids aren't even designed that well compared to most other MMO raids to say nothing of GW2 being literally one of the only MMOs to have no difficulty modes for its raids.
---
The dragons appear to have been corrupted by their own magic.
---
Is a drug-addict evil if they are so addled by their addiction that they will steal to pay for more drugs? They are not doing anything good, but they can't help themselves because addiction takes over their actions. 
---
They are in pain and always hungering for magic, so they will do whatever it takes to get more.
---
Their actions may be evil, but they are not necessarily evil themselves.
---
Hopefully not.
---
Elite specs for all profession are way more than a single episode would be able to deliver and releasing one elite spec with a single episode would take multiple years to release. Especially for Competitive game modes like PvP this would be really, really bad.
---
You're kinda missing the point of the game, of any game really. It's fun, not complexity for the sake of it. So you should not expect extremely complex fights, that was never the goal and it is never going to be, not in this game. W7 is fine in this respect, especially the Qadim fight.
---
As someone running dungeons every once in a while for fun I totally agree that some good account-bound reward would be very nice to bring more people to dungeons and would create some welcomed hype for a time.
---
oh boi it does... i played bns and bdo myself and their combat system is good but not nearly as in depth as gw2s is.
---
and sure ppl will probably say it is not in depth since anet is not even supporting their own combat system... most of the content requires you to press just 1 button but if you utilize the combat system fully ... and you kinda want to do that if you tryhard in dungeons or raids... then it is absolutely hilarious how good it is
---
Im new too i just got this last week and boosted engi to max and im hunting hero points in the desert, i fond myself do more pvp then hinting tho o really like how everything is unlocked in pvp lets you learn about everything, i hated when they locked things behind a timed wall in games i always stoped playing before it was up
---
Flame Legion is a joke because 5 people were enough to enter the citadel and kill their "god", tribune, super-weapon and destroy that funny burning-thing.
---
Newsflash, there are easy and hard modes in raids. The latter is called CM. More than this really isn't necessary in a game without a gear treadmill.
---
But... But... my RoI ?
---
Vabbian here, this link is trash, Now it’s full of creepers which only watch in the mounts to kill the enemy with the cat for the achievement. The worst.
---
I'm not sure if this is going to end well. I'm aware that using voice chat is the way to go for large teams and I don't do wvw a lot but i'm on the spanish server and it's very frequent to find in chat things like "Need help here [XXX] 10 player about to reach lord" or similar things. Of course it's typed in spanish. If we are ever merged with another language server i can tell you it's not going to change and that means we are going to have a babel tower thing on map/team chats.
---
Seems you're correct, my mistake. Wonder what chunk of AP I'm missing.
---
&gt;I would put money on it. Every time you do Urban you can pick one up if you haven't already. It should've been disabled once you finished the collection but like so many things it fell through the cracks.
---
So? You're going to farm the fractal for 2 silvers? Even on t1 I can't see that being worth my time, and especially not worth the hassle of running it solo, joining other instances and all this crap.
---
Is guild wars 2 dying?
---
What about those players who miss that particular episode?
---
When vertical progression doesn't exist, raiding isn't going to hold much attention.
---
Even in games with extreme vertical progression(gear resets every few months) the content gets stale and boring very quickly. GW2 can only survive so long on cosmetics and crafting materials as a carrot on a stick before people just cba anymore.
---
The Meta has been stale af for years.
---
They could just release all of the elites as the first episode without a map with maybe some story content? I mean that should be enough i think?
---
With some balance changes ofc
---
You can afk in keep all day. I hear there is no queue anyways! Always outnumbered
---
Have it be on sale a few times just like expansions are.
---
I just got down to 1:03.xx actually. just keep practicing. it's the little things things that will kill the time like hitting the smallest rocks.
---
"Any events up?"
---
also pretty rough to compare a pvp oriented game like bdo is to gw2
---
What
---
oh because of work i can't play that much anymore :p so a casual game is really good for me, i just don't like to see content trivialised to acomodate a part of the playing community at the expense of the other, especially when  the part of the community it's trivialised for will not play it that much at the end of thing anyway
---
Burn me. Where's a good searing cauldron when you need one?
---
You should be thanked more often. So thank you!!
---
Expansions are on sale now since they are older. Also this would basically make it pay to win, wouldn't it?
---
I think binding them to any living world episode release would be a bad idea. It could be a "double" release as they have done already with other living world episodes which also released Raids and Fractals.
---
That way any player will be able to get it when they are available and not having them being bound to a certain episode and not being able to get it when you missed it.
---
They could also sell them but then we come dangerously close to pay to win again.
---
That's a speculation with not a lot of weight. It was stated that LWS5 will have expansion-like features. Elite specs are definitely on the table.
---
&gt;Oddly, this game is freedom even without quitting, just need to switch from "need it all asap" to "let's enjoy it"....but that's probably me being too idealist.
---
I'm kind of a mix of this. I'm definitely in the impatient camp for new *features* (helicopter mount vs the Cessna mount we've had), but then am painfully casual after that.
---
I think you responded to the wrong person.
---
I love it, it's very cute! Any way to follow your work?
---
Can we have a pistol semi-rework? It's a shame that thief pistol looks cool but ultimately becomes broken, either op with unload or up with everything else.
---
I would make unload a new autoattack and nerf it a little, then give skill 3 an entirely new skill, either a 1200 range attack or a piercing attack that travels in straight line, or both.
---
the vast majory of gw2 ppl dont care about raids. and I hate that raiders bring up this shit topic all the time as if it is the only worthwile content in gw2. everything else doesnt count.
---
same with yesterdays teatime *again*. they are so deaf in their little echo chamber and act as if all other mmos have a shit ton of content to do that is so so much better than gw2s.
---
I am happy when teapot leaves for classic wow and takes his whole shit community with him...
---
Then you are good to go. Playing with your favorite class for most of the time is not wrong by any means. But if you want for some reason do some kind of high end content (fractals/raids) you will find yourself very restricted if you are only willing to play with one class (specially if your chosen class is a dps class). Sure, you can always create your own groups though.
---
I'm now just curious because everyone else is.
---
FU ANET FUCKING CUNTS
---
Reminds me of Big Mom in One Piece and her dessert obsession.
---
I have a (wishful thinking) theory that Gorrik finds a cure. I mean, he put his brother's consciousness into a golem so finding a cure for Taimi can't be THAT far-fetched.
---
Tequatl is a general akin to the Shatterer.
---
I'm talking about book lore, specifically "Sea of Sorrows".
---
Every single raider I know still finds w5 the best wing. Just because people who only do the easy bosses can't do dhuum doesn't mean it's a failure. My entire static came back for w7 and already quit the game again because w7 was a dissapointment and everything is already done and even your best raiding guilds are raiding less and less. How is getting rid of the people who made raids popular and are good at the game the right thing? The raiding scene is dying because anet is supporting raids for the people who doesn't play em.
---
It's literally the right thing to do to make raids the next super easy, braindead open world content 99% of the game already is.
---
Tuesday
---
That was amazing!  I hadn't even figured out you could activate those skills mid air.  I have a route I like that just barely gets me 19 and this makes me feel like a total chump.
---
Well done to him.
---
OP is showing appreciation for the Mastery system, because doing new and different things is better than doing the same things with x% higher numbers.
---
There is no singular champion. Tequatl The Sunless, Blightghast the Plaguebringer and the other dragons of the same magnitude are equal in that position up until Zhaitan's defeat. Which is when Tequatl got a power up, elevating him over that status - even though you can't call him a champion of Zhaitan anymore since Zhaitan is dead.
---
Haha you have met this community right if they don't release all elite specs for the new class people will bitch and the class will suffer.
---
That’s good for you.  I’m only providing information that has been given by support in the past.
---
Nice and clean.. coding?
---
It could be a nice filler before we get S5, a single episode, call it a special or something. A Priory expedition contacts Pact HQ, they found a second Tree (I don't think it's well known there are others even among Sylvari) and you go to see what's it all about. As a bonus you get to know what happened to Malyck, maybe he's their leader? Since they don't have a dream, they maybe don't have a connection to Mother Tree the same way 'our' Sulvari have?
---
I made my peace with the lack of Malyck content by convincing myself that we met him in HoT, he screamed "SUBMIT TO MORDREMOTH" and then we bombed his tree with a bunch of Quaggans, a Tengu and a Norn...
---
F o&gt;
---
Thanks! =) I'll still be around to do the odd raid now and again. That's pretty much the only interesting thing for me nowadays and it's only because of my team that makes it fun =x
---
Ok maybe not delete forever. I'll keep a snapshot of the data but from a public perspective, it won't be available anymore unless someone does stuff...with it.
---
And I instantly changed my mind lol Used the free two week pass to see what mistlock was like. Muuuuch better than Lily of Elon. So bought the pass
---
The big difference is in bigger combat. Your shade(s) don't die like mesmer clones. They also don't move on their own and won't despawn after the targetted monster died, ect.
---
Maybe I'm vad at explaining, but I just never really had fun playing mesmer, but I rly like the necro gameplay.
---
that's just how it be for us west coasters
---
Boy you’re brave posting that here 🥴
---
It has nothing to do with vertical progression wtf are you smoking?
---
It has everything to do with years of neglect from ArenaNet; low amount of content released, shitty/boring balancing a lot of the time, removing cool interactions such as distort share, picking up banners, shortening leap distances with camera tricks etc. Wipe-causing bugs existing for years, awful reward structure... the list can go on forever, you get the point.
---
The fact that the GW2 raiding community has survived so long with all of this neglect only proves we don't give a shit about vertical progression - Wing 1 is still relevant today because there are always ways to improve. Heck, that's even the entire point of Raidar - a tool to help you compare and improve yourself as a player.
---
Find me a single raider in gw2 that enjoys vertical progression over improving your own gameplay.
---
Kralk kinda feels like the oldest and most savvy dragon tbh, so I'd buy into your theory.
---
Why would I be obligated to "give it a good rep" when I don't think it deserves one in its current state? I, aswell as people that have similar thoughts, can complain as long as we feel like it and still have hope left. 
---
&gt;gw2 never was marketed has a hardcore raid game
---
I'm aware of that, but they added raids, I came back to the game after not playing for years and suddenly enjoyed the game, spent money on it for no other reason than raids being the reason I have fun in this game. And for the first year or so it WAS how I wanted it to be. Anet dropped the ball on raids and I can still hope they will pick it up at some point.
---
Something that's important to note is that just because certain players don't clear certain content doesn't mean that content isn't important to those players. For me, raids are a goal. I'm not there yet, but with practice (and networking) I expect to succeed. Having something much harder like Dhuum CM on the (very) distant horizon is a motivator for me to play the game more and get better at playing it. 
---
As said by the Path of Exile Devs in [this awesome talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM_5S55jUzk), endgame content that \~90% of the playerbase is never going to see is actually ***very*** important to implement because:
---
1. It caters to the 'hardcore' part of the playerbase who tend to be fairly devoted to the game AND tend to include streamers/content creators who basically give the game free advertising.
---
2. Players see those content creators/endgamers and think "I wish I was that good." This motivates them to get good/play the game/become more 'devoted' followers of the game. 
---
Good endgame content is just as much a part of creating a healthy playerbase as having easy, tutorial-ish content.
---
Probably the OP
---
I don't like the idea of forcing people to be part of statics / raiding guilds. Your system would make pugging / getting into raids difficult for those without a raid guild
---
Anet doesn't discount gems directly. They discount items in the gem store. The ultimate edition of each expansion does come with half price gems however.
---
Just because it is a casual game doesn't really mean there is no room for Raids in GW2 and IMO it is pretty good content.
---
The only thing the raid community wants are more Raids and them including harder challenges.
---
The thing the casuals want is to play raids in easy mode.
---
Isn't the usual buy-in on MMO raids something like 2-5%? I recall GW2's metrics were higher than average, at least.
---
Here's one idiot: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c49m1q/raids_hot_vs_pof/erw8q29/)
---
The progress needs to be personal, aka similar how AR works in fractals. If you bind it to some guild you just destroy whole concept.
---
&gt; Each tier would reward the base wing reward, with an additional 20 shards/crystals and 1 gold per boss per tier. You could only gain the addtional base reward once per week
---
Important part is additional here. Nothing changes for the base raids.
---
If want to get into tiers you can try to find a group.
---
I was with you until you started adding more and more barriers to raiding.
---
This is way too complicated, just give them a story mode. I don't even care about rewards, let them farm LI in story mode if they want to - just make it so you need at least one normal mode kill to count in the collections.
---
Oh and monthly repeatable cm's. You know why repeatable cm's won't split up the playerbase? Nobody fucking does cm's for the fun of it, when's the last time you saw a top guild do a speedrun of a CM? Only time this happens is when teapot forces them to for the ERP. Even the hardcore people in this game are wimps.
---
Nobody expects the Casual Inquisition!
---
multiple screams ;-;
---
Even though millions of people would hate it I've always wished that some eccentric billionaire would buy up a bunch of video game properties and fuse their canon together with some crazy game. (More like Final Fantasy and less like Super Smash Bros.) Like, using ESO's CHIM as the backbone, imagine combining WoW, GW2, ESO and whatever else into some stupid big new MMO. So many people would hate it, but I think it would be crazy cool. I love crossover episodes.
---
Potato.
---
Obviously potato.
---
&gt; Sure, we see Great Destroyer in GW1, but he only appears because Primordus was about to awaken right there and then.
---
Technically the great destroyer was there specifically help Primordus awaken much like Scarlett did with Mordemoth. The whole reason he didn't awaken in EoTN is because unlike with scarlet the great destroyer was stopped in time.
---
It's likely Svanir was expected to perform a similar role for Jormag before he was killed.
---
&gt; Each tier would reward the base wing reward, with an additional 20 shards/crystals and 1 gold per boss per tier. You could only gain the addtional base reward once per week 
---
Important part is additional here.
---
Nothing changes for the base raids.
---
raiding needs less barriers to entry, not more
---
Important part is additional.
---
damn pve boys
---
My list:
---
-Build Templates
---
-Rework story mode dungeons so you can do them single player (it is really hard to get into a story mode group that lets you watch cutscenes)
---
-Allies actually do something in story fights instead of basically being Mesmer clones (just Doing weak basic attacks)
---
-Canta (I’m Asian irl, I’ve gotta represent) 
---
-rework Charr and Asura armor sets and the shoulders on Sylvari 
---
-customizable weapon abilities for classes (maybe not Gw1 amount, but still would like them)
---
It’s kinda funny how you called out a strawman when there was none and then you went on and made a strawman of your own. The original comment never mentioned anything about raids.
---
&gt; Tiers give a buff to the players, which decreases all damage dealt 
---
This would only result in us approaching VG, Gorse, KC and Xera the way they were ment to be, by not not cheesing the mechanics.
---
&gt; Nice ~~strawman~~, dude.
---
False dilemma.
---
&gt; removing cool interactions such as distort share
---
You mispelled broken.
---
I think most casuals dont want to play raids in easy mode. they dont want to play raids at all actually. they just want the raid-exclusive shinies without the effort of raiding.
---
Are you talking about GW2 especially ? I see nothing in core content that hardcore (besides Orr, which is known to have been nerfed).
---
W7 cms were a joke. Took my group a total of like 4.5hrs to get the new chair. We weren't even the fastest (2nd group overall). SC beat us to full achievements unlock by like 45m iirc.
---
Never , sell them.
---
This whole post is literally about raids, and this whole comment thread - about a person making an assumption that the game is dying because an app targeted exclusively at raiders is being shut down.
---
As such, when a person in the same comment thread makes a counter-argument, the only logical conclusion is that it counters the initial topic - *raids*. Unless, of course, they do not operate on logic and instead post random observations in random places (:
---
They messed up with dungeons, their original aim was to make them "extremely challenging that only 10% of players could complete"
---
Yes, if using it as a chrono replacement. I mentioned power quickbrand specifically because the comment I replied to was talking about sharing gear with DH.
---
Whoever wins, we zerg
---
gee you look really mature dogpiling on someone with a different view of the game to yourself.
---
i hope you feel bad about it, but considering you are likely a very text book Toxic Gamer, the kind that deservedly gets mocked on subs like /r/gamersriseup you won't.
---
7 years of having the same basic menu for the toilet. The UI for both the TP and Crafting have gotten updates, and we've even gotten the ability to purchase multiples from vendors. We are way passed due for a toilet update.
---
That all sounds fair yes, and I would be in support of an easy mode as well. I am just not sure how easy mode should reward players to ensure they are actually played but they do not give comparable rewards with normal mode.
---
Don't be an asshole.
---
Clearly that's a fascist way to develop a video game, amirite ?
---
If you want achievs
---
Open them
---
Atleast thats what i do.
---
It wouldn't have hurt to have 1 filler episode squeezed in between Aurene Death and Resurrection.
---
It might be "real" advice from your (experienced) perspective but it isn't all that helpful for a surface level introduction to supports where the biggest concern is just going to get a foot into the door.
---
That diviner renegade with pack runes can come later when they are doing more than fractal level 15.
---
Quite a lot, actually, to my memory; the old forum thread is likely expunged, but I do have the text on my PC. Might do a post one day about it, just for the hell of it! :D
---
Tempest comes close, but it can't match the speed in which a druid can cap might on 10 people. It also requires you to drop invigorating torrents for the 10man shout trait.
---
Right now is currently the best situation we've had for optimal **double heal comp** classes, but druid is still the best option in a solo healer/support capacity.
---
What if reddit posts actually made some sense.
---
There's a handful of problems with your premise because they would play out differently in reality.
---
Tying increased rewards to increased tiers just further incentivizes skilled players to continue playing with skilled players.  Why would I ever want to play with less skilled players for less gold when I have the option not to?
---
I'm not involved with raid selling guilds but I highly doubt people buy raids for the weekly rewards, but are really after the achievements.
---
Finding new members for a guild static throws a wrench in a lot of things.  Suppose a team member has to quit the game.  9 other players have to either reset their progression to accommodate the new blood or we have to search for an extremely skilled player that isn't in a guild already.
---
Tying progression to guilds means a couple super guilds will form that have maxed their progression.  This guild will either sell spots at a premium or will just become the de facto lfg guild for people who want to skip ahead.
---
I get what you're going for,  but this isn't the way.
---
thanks for that! I am more into blobby fighting and gvg truth is - is Whiteside Ridge more toxic than FSP then? Is FSP just as active? Im not on pc right now to check
---
I agree with you, I would enjoy this system very much and it would actually help me getting more interest in my training runs where I help noobs break into raids each week. 
---
Overall I don't think that it would help the general population get into raids because they just don't care about playing the game, although I don't think it would have a negative impact it wouldn't have a positive one either (not enough to be worth it, the goal is to get the majority of the game playing raids, even if that hurts us, the veterans).
---
Regardless I still think it's way too complicated/too many resources for ArenaNet to ever implement, sadly.
---
Almost like Firebrigade is a more specific composition that requires further organisation if you want to run it and probably isn't the best thing to consider if you are just getting into raids and fractals as a support...
---
Ahh thanks! I forgot to say Im interested in anything BUT roaming. I dont mind using comms and playing meta builds but yeah I do prefer english. I wasnt going to join the other language speaking servers. 
---
Are Desolation and Blacktide ok and friendly in terms of community? Or even Whiteside Ridge? I guess for me thats the most important part - I dont want to have to deal with flaming or spammy map/team chats and being friendly/communicative is key.
---
nobody dreams about temporary content
---
On gorse it's quite common to wipe at 0%
---
NA or EU?
---
Idd, I miss 550 ap from GW1 and i need giant slayer (852/1000) kills thats all AP i need in general category
---
My ping playing on NA all those years has been 150 sometimes 200ish. Im just used to it by now and never notice it. The delay is a couple milliseconds but after playing there for so long its not noticeable. I do expect lower ping if i am to transfer :P
---
That would be TagvsTagvsTag. 
---
New game mode pls. :I…
---
you can get 10k zhaitaffy (for droobert and eating achieves) by doing dailies.

I like how you say:
---
&gt;	If you don’t like her that’s fine
---
Then spend the rest of your long rant telling them why they're wrong and need to never express that opinion because you disagree with them.
---
Makes sense that you'd connect with the Taimi character.
---
Would anybody also be able to pin-point some EU gvg and semi-casual guilds that dont transfer around a lot? I prefer to stay loyal to the server/guilds I join and usually stick with them for a long time but sometimes its hard to find a good guild since so many bandwagon links around now for the sake of fights.
---
They are evil  *right now* though.  They have built some means of justifying their harmful actions to others in the persuit of trying to make themselves feel better.  There is no shame or guilt in a justified action which means they are unwilling or unable to acknowledge the harm they're causing to others.  
---
No matter the underlying cause, this is acting so selfishly that you don't care that you're doing harm to someone else.  This is evil.  
---
But redemption is a thing and being evil is not permanent.  Getting out of that hole before you die in it is a real SOB... But worth it IMO.
---
&gt; Years before the Searing, when I was just a child, I saw the Charr murder my father... and I hid in the woods. Later, I did terrible things to avenge his death, to assuage my guilt...until I finally realized the difference between vengeance and obsession. Once he's walked both sides of the path, a man never again blurs the line between darkness and light. I've seen evil. I offered it my hand. Never again. - [Aidan, Guild Wars: Nightfall](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Aidan#Dialogue)

1) race won't change anything except they would have to hire two new VA and redo all existing armors. And of they dare to use just armors from other race players will go bananas. No no no no! never! don't waste any dev time for this.
---
2) while branching is cool, linear is faster and quicker to do. One branch cost enough time to make another chapter. Then I choose another chapter than replaying on another hero to see another branch of shorter story. And you want longer and branching story. Make it: good, fast, cheap. Choose two, never three.
---
3) I hope that pvp content will never be gated behind expansion. Keep it open for everyone. Thanks.
---
Y, after a mass exodus of players which were unable to play together with their friends/family in a MMO. Pretty bold move to sell a MMO without any teamcontent. Especially after lying to the GW1 playerbase that GW2 would offer content for them.
---
Still expecting Snargle's reaction to that moment. Not sure if it will be heartwrenching or have him laughing his ass off like some of the others were. : P

If you mean Seirian, I'm fairly certain she's been there since release. She certainly wasn't added just with Dragonbash. She's one of a few Sylvari placed as travelers to show off their curiosity, etc.
---
NA
---
He's right, I never mentioned anything about raids and I don't really raid.
---
In general I'm just talking about how the current direction is, in my opinion, going to cause the downfall of a game that could've been so much more.
---
meh you can just sell and wait till the end . its reaching 1 silver rn and soon it will be cheaper
---
It’s still a strawman. 
---
You are assuming the person made the argument out of  concern for GW2 raidar shutting down, but it may have been out of concern for the general population leaving the game.
---
It’s a strawman because are creating and then destroying an argument that the person never brought up. You assuming what he meant puts words on his mouth that he never said.
---
huh... guess I was high then...?
---
Also, elder dragons did awaken before, periodically, that was discovered by Jotunn and other old races back then.
---
The main point is you don't need zhaitaffy from coffers. Don't open coffers if your goal is to get zhaitaffy, It's cheaper to buy zhaitaffy directly from the TP anyways. I'd only recommend opening coffers if you want to gamble for the infusion or ascended skins.
---
Fantastic.
---
10% of the players is pretty huge though.
---
We tried using alternatives healers (either renegade or firebrand) but except on special encounters like Adina with boon thief + renegade, we didn't think it was that great in the end (and we do run tempest+druid where tempest is quite refreshing when playing mirage for endurance regen on op of vigor)
---
Casual crowd is also declining in the same cycle as every MMO, after each expansion is released the player activity slowly dies out until the next expansion is released which spikes it back up again. The only difference is that Anet announced they're not doing the expansion that would have otherwise been this year, which means that upwards spike won't happen.
---
but if they do it then spirit shard into gold conversion gets faster and more automatic = economy goes rip. thats why nobody does that atm, because of the clicking. if you made it automatic, ppl with 10k+ spirit shards would flush it all at once

&gt; In general I'm just talking about how the current direction is, in my opinion, going to cause the downfall of a game that could've been so much more.
---
I agree that Living Story is a lot of wasted resources, and repeatable content should be the way to go... just not the raid way (since raids are after all the context of the thread). Fractals, dungeons, new metas on old maps; heck, just turning the LS instances into actual repeatable group dungeons would be a start. With their promises of changes in LS5 and the current story-focused plot finished, I'm hopeful.
---
Oh please, I got my Grandmaster badge for making misty thicket picnic baskets.. You have _nothing_ to complain about.
---
Which laptop / CPU is it?
---
Or wanting to play a tank (a true tank but not face tanking; and other than chrono) in open world and fractals. 
---
P.S. I understand that with the current game/combat mechanics that won’t happen due to various factors. But being chastised to help improve the mechanics and tweak them to make tanking useful and worthwhile in those settings feels like what OP states above.
---
Few suggestions from [my famous official forums thread](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/18677/do-raids-need-easy-normal-hard-difficulty-mode-merged):
---
* **Easy mode:** Generic ascended loot, clearing the whole wing drops x1 LI.
---
* **Normal mode:** Unique loot (minis, skins, infusions, etc), each boss drops x1 LI (3-4 total for the whole wing).
---
* **Hard mode:** Higher chance of unique loot, raiding seasons with leaderboards and special rewards for the best raiders (kinda like PvP leagues).
---
That would do it. Every completed level would unlock the rewards of the previous level, so doing normal mode would give you the easy mode rewards too (just like fractal tiers).
---
They want to raid, but "400 LI + KP" is not inviting.  
---
Easy mode without giving access to the shinies but allowing to get a first experience with boss mechanics \*may\* help.
---
I'm a noob and just Googled about gw2raidar. 
---
This game has an amazing community of players.
---
yeah looking back I wash I had sword 4+f1
---
&gt; awful reward structure
---
Thats the part that applies to vertical progression. Obviously its not the only aspect, but every mmorpg complains about its raid game and yet it continues to thrive because you have a reason to do the content - get geared for the next content.
---
You could be doing the most recent raid content in GW2 wearing the same gear you wore in the first raid. Crafting materials and currency are the only reward scheme in GW2, outside of personal bests(time trials) and the latter is interesting to about 1% of the 1% that even do raids.
---
I'm sorry we weren't able to improve this as much as we'd have liked. 
---
It was heavily discussed and knew it was an issue we just didn't have the resources to solve it. I did what I knew on the front end to improve performance but that wasn't a large bottleneck and that's where my technical skills end pretty abruptly. I understand performance is a large detractor from overall UX and would have loved to have done more work there. One of the primary reasons we went open source was to see if anyone else could figure out ways to improve the performance.
---
True because its a DPS race, Dhuum we don't really see the enrage timer very often but we carried on as a low man with guys dying early ;-;
---
&gt; It's hard content you have to struggle for that gives a feeling of accomplishment when you beat it.
---
But raids are mostly a joke. Do you realize I want both easy and hard modes?
---
Exactly, some of the filler events like escort or river could have been real bosses instead, but they had to put something there for the newbies who want to farm their weekly LIs.
---
It's more like their magic has gotten a mind of its own and it's driving their actions.  
---
Remember Bloodstone Fen and all the [Bloodstone-Crazed](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bloodstone_Crazed) people there, and bloodstone-crazed creatures scattered across the world.  
---
They turned extremely aggressive and magic-hungry.   
---
Regardless of whether they were originally evil or not, they all ended magic-hungry like the elder dragons.  
---
My personal theory is that there's one or more of some sort of entity, mind or spirit scattered in the magic flowing in the world, that can't remember much about themselves and isn't really fully conscious, but stills keeps the unconscious impulse to be whole again.   
---
Whoever gets magic in their body also gets fragments of this entity, but they are usually too scattered to affect anyone negatively.  At most it be a discomfort.   
---
When someone gets more magic that they can handle within them, they start seeing visions, probably remnants of the memories of the entity scattered in the magic and the mists.   
---
And if someone gets way too much magic beyond what they can handle, they get overpowered and end up under control of a fragment of an entity, getting the irresistible impulse  to seek more and more magic.  
---
And if the magic gathers on its own it can form magic elementals, and enough magic can form anomalies who behave in the same way, seeking more magic to complete themselves.  
---
Any concentration of these fragments and anyone affected by enough of them would then only care about being whole again, so they would go on a rampage to gather more magic. But the more magic they gather, the more fragments they gather, the stronger the fragments get, and the stronger the impulse to gather more magic, so they only get worse.   
---
Maybe magic itself is the 'fragments' of the entity, and magic originally came to be when something happened to this entity to split itself or release part of itself in the form of what came to be known as magic.
---
Do I pretend piken got screwed with my post? The answer to that is no. It even mentions Kodash in it and that they are worse off. 
---
Piken is not full, in fact far from it but it's not just about Piken, it's about the split that has happened and the fact guilds and friendship groups are fractured. It's also about Anets outdated systems and how they are effecting people's gameplay. 
---
And you are right we do have enough pop to sustain without a link bit it the fact the server says it's full and has done for months on end. When this is totally untrue.
---
If you think Anet is going through the work of adjusting every armor and outfit of the game towards a new race you got some really weird few on that company.
---
That's far to much work.
---
How long does it take to bang out the whole POF story? Tempted to get my wife her griffon :P
---
Well, most of the hardcore/dedicated players I know are rich, and never spend real money on gems because they don't need to, they always convert from gold.
---
I'm pretty certain most whales are casual players who barely play at all compared to us.
---
They were on a timer because we had world servers where you could follow the event progress. But with the megaservers now nobody knows how old the map is or when the last event on the map was. I would love to have them on a specific timer.
---
The MF UI is one of the most unintuitive (least intuitive?) designs I've ever had the misfortune of tolerating in a game. There really is no reason to not just give it the same layout and design as any other crafting window and save the recipes.
---
 So much clicking! 
---
Well played, my dear. I suspected you had a sense of the dramatic in you.
---
I can taste the sarcasm.
---
GW2 raids abuse of insta-kill mechanics a lot too. I mean, how many bosses require really intense healing?
---
thats not a buisness idea it's what i say to you,
---
what's the difference between watching the story on youtube and watching it ingame if you only want to do raid for the story?
---
You also want to confront the mechanics? spoiler : anet can't bring the mechanics difficulty down otherwise you can just don't bother with them at all (and that is already the case for a number of them)
---
Scarlet found a splinter group of the flame legion. Splinter because most of them scattered after their leader and most of them were killed. Like I said, yes, some loners still exist but they’re not high in numbers nor do they form warbands. YOU should learn how to read, buddy. I’m not even sorry for saying this, but you’re an idiot.
---
They'd have to write and create the racial personal story too
---
I interpreted that as a similar approach they did with LS2  that led into HoT, and LS4 that led into PoF.
---
LS4 was the continuation of and eventually conclusion of PoF. LS5 will be the introduction to the next xpac.
---
And I think it will only be story wise, with a few new masteries spread across the episodes. Introducing new elite specs won't happen, those will most probably be left for xpacs.
---
But I guess that's the same for a world boss map that has a pre right? And they are on a timer, but..
---
I guess they don't have so ma y pre events leading up to the main event though.
---
It would be a sellable point for an expac. But, if theyre only doing living world from
---
here on out, then what other time do we have? Tengu also already have some assets as they were developed as a playable race but then scrapped before GW2 launch.
---
I'm really getting tired of this "LI/KP requirements are just too high" bullshit.
---
If youre too lazy to look for a training group and deal with the failures that come with your first raid experience, raids are not for you. Period.
---
We all had to whipe hundreds of times and collect experience over the time of several months to get to the point where we can join a "400LI + KP" and actually contribute to the squads success.
---
Congratulations, you're a quick learner.
---
Too bad 90% of the rest of the game isn't.
---
I want the weekly mag shard cap to equal the amount of mag shards rewarded from clearing w1-4. Besides that, cantha would be neat!
---
I think it will be completely uneventful because the model is working, and the wales are continuing to buy the lootboxes.
---
Those bosses were always on a timer but the temple events have a cd from 2 hours. And they could start whenever a new overflow was created.
---
it was a joke. relax.
---
They appear like crying babies because there is raid cummunities that require only bare bone effort to start out.
---
But if you tell them about that they either ignore you or shame you for promoting elitists that force them to change gear and click buttons that are not "1".
---
If you do 25% in 2 phases you have plenty room dps-wise, yes
---
Yeah, they hadn‘t a specific timer but you would know when the next was. Because the page could follow the map ips.
---
Mistlock &amp; Lily of the Elon ftw
---
And yet they still used other materials too...
---
I'd do them frequently if they were on a fixed timer.
---
Outlander?
---
Is not worth it if you plan on using it to craft gear while you level up. There is an over supply of gear on the trading post so you'll find any weapon or armor cheaper there.
---
If you want to make gold or craft ascended gear, then suddenly crafting becomes worthy. There are a lot of items crafted once per day that you can sell in the trading post and you need max level crafting in order to create an ascended item.
---
So yes, crafting is worth it but mostly at level 80.
---
I wasn't talking about CM kills, obviously support scourge is good on Sabir CM for example because of CPC, the same reason that in the same video they bring DPS scourge. 
---
I'm not saying that support scourge is bad or unplayable, just that to claim it's the reason that people cleared the wing in a few hours is disingenuous. The majority of world first groups did not in fact bring one.
---
Give us a link OP!
---
I hate them now for posting this but few have the bravery to do so
---
I think it's mostly going to be business as usual,  with the main difference being potentially a bit of additional media coverage, due to various outlets posting interviews conducted with Anet during E3.  But beyond that, I don't see us getting more than a trailer.
---
Kodash weren't linked because Anet had decided to link international servers with international servers and national servers with national servers. For the same reason Baruch wasn't linked and other german servers weren't either.
---
Can you give any empirical evidence that Piken has one of the largest population or is that just your subjective interpretations?
---
I open them all.
---
Sounds like a great idea :)
---
Mounted combat is interesting.
---
I find myself thinking about mounted E-Specs - ranger on buffed pet as mount using F1-3 for the pet appropriate skills or perhaps with Engineer, gaining a customised mech depending on the situation needed.
---
Though, the mounts themselves would need to be limited on what they can do movement wise to differentiate them from travel mounts - lore wise; extra armour or weapons or bred in a manner for conflict
---
Just some thoughts
---
Also a 'Repeat' button please for Mystic Clovers.
---
can always come boycott our squad sometime ^_^
---
Doesn't look like it does or it has a much lower drop rate.
---
Super cool! Almost no wasted movement at all. Very impressive routing.
---
I turned in all of my luck last Wintersday....it is only July and I have nearly 12 stacks of exotic luck now just from normal play. 
---
I'd love a MF cap increase or some other way to use luck other than guild halls.
---
To be fair, there's really only two things shared between GW1 and GW2. The Lore, and their awful dx9 based engine. So I wouldn't really rope all those years playing GW1 in with GW2.
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Seirian](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Seirian)
---
Firebrand is very much a tank option that’s viable and “other than chrono”
---
But wouldn't clearing the bosses once be enough for the collections for the most part? If people were allowed to get LIs from easy mode, they could slowly but surely get the legendary armor etc. in given time.
---
&gt;  what the dude did is extremely toxic 
---
Really? Extremely toxic? You don't think you're being a bit dramatic?
---
The bosses aren't just dangerous enough. There's no condition heavy boss, cc heavy boss, etc.
---
I would love to see bosses who specialize on specific boons and conditions, who force you to go out of the dps meta to be really efficient.
---
Misty Thicket picnic baskets.
---
. . . hey, brother, the flashbacks are back! All that "chance to fail" for quest combines in the crafting stations coming back!
---
This thread is for players to ask each other questions, no devs read this.
---
Back when raids were being actively developped and not a once-a-year release, a very vocal group of people here and on the forum basically asked for raids developpement to be shut down because it was *stealing ressources* from open world content. That created a pretty ugly split in the community and raids related threads were being downvoted to oblivion for the better part of HoT.
---
It's underrepresented because it's not the focus. Dungeons have been dead and left to rot for the better part of 5 years now. And fractals... We get what, 1 per year? That's not enough content to keep things fresh.
---
Yes, which is why I'd still suggest ascended skins requiring a kill on normal.
---
People can still get legendary armor currently just by doing Escort, Trio, River and W4 B1-3 weekly followed by just the achievements. With my suggestion you at least have a progression path that makes sense!
---
There are limited options for an easy mode reward structure but that is because there are limited options for raid rewards outright due to no gear progression or even alternatives like raid exclusive sigils and runes.
---
Oh thank you. 
---
I was confused too. XD
---
Honestly this is how I feel about the community right now.
---
In other games, it's hardcore who bully the casuals.
---
In GW2, it's the casuals who bully the hardcore community.
---
We suggest challenge motes in the Living Story, we get treated like we just said heresy. 
---
Hardcore players matter too...
---
&gt; The thing the casuals want is to play raids in easy mode.
---
Casuals do not want to play easy mode raids. They do not want to raid, period.
---
No matter how easy you make raids, it will not change things. We already have an easy raid, and it's called Wing 4.
---
1. because maybe its full and the game pioritized in another way.  
---
2. because you made a different instance if you are already in the fractals...the different fractals are all in one instance.  
---
3. because you left the party which doesn't want to get kicked out instead.  
---
4. because multiple maps are closing.  
---
5. because its a raid instance.
---
Also GW2 doesn't have anything arbitrarily increasing clear time like in other MMOs.
---
Though, I do think they could reduce the enrage timers though to add a bit of pressure to progression raiding.
---
Except aggro/threat mechanics are “random” in open world and fractals. So while you can build tanky and provide defensive support to allies if the mob ignores you and goes straight for someone other than you, ten you aren’t “tanking”.  
---
Random aggro to mean sometimes it’s based off of toughness other times dig output, or healing output or furthest/closest player.
---
They use support tempest a lot too.
---
Alright that one is your own fault. There's plenty of global TP issues though and I recall them saying in 2012 that the current TP was some kind of temporary placeholder thing. I came back this year and to my surprise the TP was still not changed.
---
They should make challenge mode raids consistently rewarding so players want to complete them each week. Normal and CM could give separate rewards so players have incentive to do up to double the amount of raiding per week, and have the CM rewards include a box with a small chance at getting unique or difficult to obtain skins / infusions. The first kill on each boss regardless of regular or CM would give an LI / LD, so that progression remains the same, but it's important that both modes provide their own rewards so that elitism doesn't become a problem.
---
Not saying this would fix everything, but it'd be a simple-to-implement means of extending the content. The new raid areas are gorgeous and I'm sure the bosses take ages to program, so it seems ashame not to incentivise repeating it with greater challenges, especially when people are specifically asking for more challenge.
---
I don't know if this could be in a xpac, but it would be nice for LS maybe. I want some kind of elite specs obtainable by collections (NOT TIMEGATED) but some kind of "learning" the new elite. It would be bound a bit more.
---
In my personal opinion, i don't want to see more GW blinks, we had enought already and i thank that. Let's have new air here.
---
I despise meteor farm with a passion. Still have 1k kralk to go (and you can bet i'm buying any missing powdered rose from tp).
---
I usually run healbrand for this so i can give quickness for better gathering, but this post makes me want to DH and DPS the meteor as hard as i can just out of spite...
---
Also as someone already says, failing the meteor bugs the next one (maybe?). That plus multimap being kind of dead right now (maybe all the "pro" farmers are doing the event) means it's just better to kill it, preferably as late as possible.
---
Anyway, it's amusing how people get this mad for a few currency... It's not like you get nothing if you complete the event...
---
Nah they will release a one minute trailer on a random thursday and season 5 will start on the following tuesday. Full blown up hype leads to inevitable disappointment after all. Nobody wants that. The newsletter e-mail will go out on the weekend after release to make sure inactive players don't stress the servers too much on release day.
---
Some of them look highly arroused.
---
And here you can find the customary  "ANET IS DEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAD!" post which contributes nothing to the discussion.
---
 Thank you for continuing the tradition.
---
what r u talking about, GW2 was designed to be an e-sport
---
 Chrono. The off build for chrono still runs about half zerker gear. The other half is Diviner stats. You have all the boons in the game and can keep full uptime at 50% boon duration (easy with food, runes, and a few diviner stat items). You also get a lot of healing for stationary fights with Alls Well and heal well.   
---
Chrono is also in constant demand for raids and fractals. Besides that, firebrand/dragonhunter is an easy swap though you need a complete new set if you are intending to heal.
---
WvW used to have pve content, and even a world boss (the giant grub)
---
Desert BL was criticized for having too much pve in it.
---
\&gt;tfw you forget half of your commit
---
drop out of merge and use your pet, you don't have to/aren't meant to stay permanently merged.

When doing world bosses or meta anet could place me in a map with bots instead of players and I wouldn't notice a difference. MMO btw.
---
&gt;They might be a joke for you and me, but they're pretty challenging to other people, specially because the mechanics are kinda hard to learn without a guide.
---
i blind ran w7 air cardinal and we cleared cm in 1 hour.
---
Such events tend to fuck over the WvW community. 
---
If they can't play their game mode for like a week or two, they'll just find something else to play and stich with that. The result? WvW dies a little bit more, despite the handful of pve players who got drawn into it.
---
Oh look another toxic casual who wants to step on the fun of people who have been with this game since 2012 and franchise since 2006.
---
1. The game will try to place you on the same map, but there are soft and hard limits to the map capacity. If the map is over the soft limit then it will try to place people in different maps. If the map has not reached the hard limit then you can still right-click on a player in the squad and join their map.
---
2. Fractals are instanced content and you cannot jump between instances, therefore you would need to return to an "open world" map to see the message.
---
3. You cannot be in an instance without being in the party that "owns" the instance.
---
4. Sometimes there are several low-population maps so when leaving one you may be placed into another.
---
5. Because the instance is considered a raid, and you can only enter a raid in a raid squad.
---
use shortbow then, it has better survivability
---
Foo! 404

"If you’re very good friends, you can give them nicknames. But that’s between you and your weapons." nameable weapons? I wonder how many people are gonna call them things like Excalibur, Elucidator and my penis (my p3n15).
---
I am the type of person who enjoys gameplay, not "getting" or "having" stuff. This is the problem. Not the "get it asap", but "how it is achieved". Running to spots on a map and pressing F, waiting for a day or 2 hours or spending gold is not good gameplay in my book, and the skyscale is not fun. This is why I quit.
---
I find it ridiculous that a lot of people throw instant gratification around as an insult, and they just assume this is the problem.
---
Didn't the complete map lagged if the middle event started?
---
If you're be OK with said data being publicly accessible, I could host a compressed dump of the database on my website, so that in case someone would ever want to do something with it - it'd be immediately available to them. Not the logs, however, I dread to even imagine how much your log archive weighs.
---
When you are so excited about a contest that the page doesn't exist
---
So they would deliver us content and features for both expansions in a price of one? Ridiculous.
---
Thanks, Lots of ideas for funny PvP characters!
---
Who is this guy and what does he say?
---
Desert BL was a mess at release.
---
It's much better now, in my personal opinion. But WvWers are still salty about it.
---
Honestly, WvW gets the short end of the stick. Hardcore players matter too...
---
They actually did do substantial back-end TP updates in the interim. The TP is much more stable and fast than it once was, and it has better sorting and filtering than it did back in 2012.

Why won't they post the Forum post, then the announcement?

I'm just pointing out a fact it may slip through the cracks its just nice for people to understand.

A videogame critic and journalist who's against the questionable actions that large establishments make, brings light to topics through humour, parody and sarcasm.
---
Has his own gimmicks and schtick, and comes across a bit too flamboyantly at times, but in most cases remaining relevant and poignant.
---
&gt; the community in this game apparently just feels entitled to have everything by just login in
---
It's by design. Anet doesn't want people who want to work for things ingame.
---
They need people who want to buy things instead, through the gemstore - preferably with $$
---
No way to make suggestions? :(
---
Hmm... but that's just a normal boon chrono with 0 or 5 extra toughness. I wouldn't call that hybrid.
---
Maybe so, but it works in so many other places not only in GW2, I also have a faint memory of it working in previous TP
---
The wiki page for any gem store item generally shows what price it was listed at when it was last available.
---
I used to do multiple full clears a week through LFG raids, some training and some requiring 332041720413240 LI. There was far more toxicity from upset casual players being asked to change something they were doing (generally traits) than from "toxic elitists."

Most well known for criticizing Steam's inability to pre-screen trash games, and his vocal criticism of publishers doing greedy self-destructive things like pushing lootboxes and subscriptions into everything now, including single-player AAA games.

This video is basically "lootboxes and other randomized slot machine mechanics are predatory and prey specifically on people weak to gambling, and that hurts video games in more ways than just being a scummy business practice."
---
That law is terribly stupid, but we can also use John Oliver's method: Gilver Gottfried.

If you are from the UK, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkLqAlIETkA) instead that video.

Oh they already have some names and want us to choose from those. I'm disappointed  \\&gt;:C

" kodash which has been hard stuck in t4/t5 for months straight"
---
"kodash has been (and still is) in their situation for more than a year and regularly ends in t4 / t5"
---
These are your quotes. So, during "months straight" and "more than a year" Anet had decided to link national servers only with national servers, and at the same time keeping 5th tier with 3 servers. For this reason only, german servers couldn't get a link because the number of german main servers and linked servers was never the same. Not having a link during that that implies for Baruch as well.

And right now it's a lucky draw.

That's such a beautiful arrangement of a classic GW1 theme! I'd love to see you tackle a lot more pieces from GW1 or GW2! The classic main theme from Prophecies, the Vabbi track, etc.
---
Agressive video game monetization in GW2? Where?
---
In all your scenarious the effect would be the same as with W5 - players dropping out of the raid community, only much worse. It won't happen.
---
Yeah I manged to get a bank of 200 fliping coffers when it came out.now I dont know if I sgould just gamble or keep flipping.
---
Raids are meant for hardcoreplayers. Content made for 1% of the playerbase isn't keeping the game alive. An exansion which only offers raids, esl pvp and a new map for WvW players ranked 5000+ would not be seen as content by most players.
---
Open world teamplay is debatable. Events usually don't fail because I failed to heal my teammates. It requires very little interaction between players (mostly only rezz). You don't need to run a metabuild or tequatl will fail. It's mostly an anonymus blob, nothing were players will interact much with each other. There are bots for silverwaste farming etc. and it's impossible to tell that these are bots. Whole zerg could be bots or npcs and it would be the same gaming experience. Since release I haven't put a single open world player onto my friends list. Sure, there are coordinated groups for tripple t, there were guilds for tequatl, tarir and so on. I'm aware. But it's still a very different, less personal, way to play. Small scale instanced content is very different. As example I yesterday did a GW1 dungeon with only one other human player and we added each other to our friendslists afterwards. Or in other words: I added more players in GW1 this year to my friendlist than in GW2 open world content since release, despite spending A LOT more time in GW2 open world. GW2 open world feels like battling dragons in skyrim with the help of townguards. It's casual friendly, solofriendly, justified. But there is still a need for casual small scale team content. Guilds/teams complain a lot about lacking content in GW2.
---
can't tell if you're actually asking for an answer, or doing one of those "ask questions you feel are blindingly obvious as a way to publicly complain while maintaining the pretense of looking for advice/answers"
---
100 jorbreakers though my tiny guild that's a pipe dream
---
The reason the raid lfg is so toxic is because a lot of people dont understand how the lfg works.
---
Explaining every detail now would take to long. But what you can take away from this is:
---
A group that says "400 LI" doesnt just look for a player who has 400LI. They look for a player with a certain skill level that is confident in his role.
---
Of course you can farm 400 LI by just doing Escort on dps. But if you dare to join a dhuum group on an open world chrono build and make the group whipe over and over again, the group has every right to be toxic, because youre wasting 9 peoples limited free time.
---
If you want to experience raids in a friendly atmosphere, join a group thats explicitly for training newbies.
---
Guys. It was just a joke :D
---
&gt; Choose from the following options:
---
&gt; Mist Champion’s Weapon Set (Example: Mist Champion’s Dagger)
---
&gt; Mist Lord’s Weapon Set (Example: Mist Lord’s Dagger)
---
&gt; Gilded Weapon Set (Example: Gilded Dagger)
---
&gt; Elegant Weapon Set (Example: Elegant Dagger)
---
Honestly the names don't inspire much imo
---
That would be awesome!
---
OTOH the usually most-loved raid is Ulduar, which had no LFR, not even the game-integrated LFG system that got released 1 tier afterwards.
---
How is "hey what do you want these weapons to be called" even remotely a red flag?
---
I'm torn, I loved the world changing nature of events, I was there when that thing happened, the changed world reminds me of those things happening, the world feels alive and moving forward.
---
But I do regret missing some parts of season 1, like the marionette, I never got to see that, so I understand the frustration of missing content and never being able to do it.
---
It's everyone dude...
---
When people suggests stuff like Story Mode raids, the hardcore population jumps to tear them appart. Raid elitism is for real.
---
Stuff like this always happened, it's normal in MMOs, I mean, dungeons back then were the "meta or burst, no necros and rangers allowed" thing. The thing is that GW2's community has an unprecedent ammount of White Knights who act as agressively as the Spanish Inquisition.
---
The main problem is with recipes taking variable components like amalgamated gemstones. I think that could be solved for recipes with only 1-2 variations but would be a pain for recipes with dozens of variations.
---
Still that should be fixed somehow, as it is a pain in the ass to do multiple ones
---
I dont really understand what youre trying to tell me tbh...
---
what does ANet putting few ressources into raid development have to do with players complaining about high entry barriers and toxicity?
---
Why everyone wants Tengu? They are these ... balding disgusting birds. Have you ever seen a pidgeon up close?
---
Stop scrolling down, it's not good down there.
---
But we have expansions every 3-4 weeks and they are completely free to active players. 
---
If you want to actually get less players in game, then ask for expansion. You won't believe how many players are from super poor countries that cannot afford WoW sub or even one Gw2 expansion. 
---
Giving us LS only, with promised "expac lvl features" (guessing elite classes and multiple fresh masteries) that is free or can be bought with game gold is far more superior than any big expac.
---
Dungeons were pretty hardcore tbh. Giganticus Lupicus in its original iteration, before powercreep, was a 15 minute long boss fight with multiple phases. He was harder than most raid bosses are today.
---
All is Vain Weapon Set, with the Shit-Balance Blade.
---
if you ever pug, you'll still see a ton of minstrel chronos out there, unfortunately. and they still don't want to tank :)
---
The portable isnt that great anyway.. Since for most of the stuff you need items from Miyani.
---
The portable one was good back in the day when ppl ugpraded greens to rares.
---
And if you know that you are going to mass-craft, then the port is well worth it.
---
Maybe even a new sound, ey?
---
gilded and elegant just seem like options for the sake of options. mist lord doesn't do it for me (wouldn't be surprised if someone complains about the gender exclusivity tbh). which only leaves one real and unimpressive choice, imo.
---
The wiki has a list of special, and recurring sales, including the historical sales prices. [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem\_Store#Special\_sales](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem_Store#Special_sales) 
---
While not in a comprehensive list, some amazing people on the forums have been keeping track of gemstore updates here: [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/458/news-gemstore-items-new-returned-sales/p1](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/458/news-gemstore-items-new-returned-sales/p1)
---
This has always been a nonsense statement. "more than expected" can mean that anet expected 5 players to do raids, but it was 6. That's "more than expected". There is a reason why Anet is not developing raid content fast. 
---
It also depends why Anet expected such numbers. Other MMOs might have lower numbers of players doing raids initially. But with level cap increasing, powercreep etc. numbers might grow a lot. While in GW2 numbers of active raid players probably dropped. Maybe Anet has expected much more players to get into raids after a few months/years and was disappointed.
---
You can get a very rough impression by looking at GW2 efficiency stats. 10-20% of GW2 efficiency users got ~10-140 LI. Is this an active raid player? If we say 10 LI indicates active raid players you got 20% of efficincy users as active raiders. A third party site. Mostly used by hardcore players. Your average open world player who is running his fullsoldier, fullsignet rifle build is not registered there. Most hardcoreplayers are. So maybe it's not 1% who is doing raids, maybe it's 2%.
---
I don't know why but the guy smiling at the end makes me very happy.
---
Charr maps/a Charr expansion, I wanna see the Blood and Ash Citadels.
---
In terms of features I'm not too fussed, I'd rather they focus on more content.
---
\*Casual do not want to play (easy mode) raids. They just want the loot.
---
Maybe in 2003 we'll have that tech.
---
Yes, the skyscale collections require a lot of work and are annoying to do. But nobody's making anybody do any of it. You don't need a skyscale (unless you want Vision). Honestly, the worst part about the skyscale collections are the complaints about it, which I think this video perfectly demonstrates.
---
Like fuck it was, it's always been a casual game. PvP was basically in a beta at launch.
---
&gt;I've been playing guild wars games **longer than some of those casuals are alive**
---
In my experience, most of the casuals are 30 + year olds who don't have the time or the will to dedicate themselves to games like a teenager could and would.
---
easy: mist=shit in german, so mist lord aka shit lord.
---
(but it seems to be a good looking weapon set ; )
---
If you need money, go participate in the Dragon Bash in and around Hoelbrak.  If you can complete the Adventures and get gold medals in them, you'll earn 7 Dragon Coffers daily from each (note: You'll need to rent a Roller Beetle mount from an NPC to be able to get gold on the race adventure, but that rental lasts an hour, more than enough time to learn how to ride and finish the race).  Dragon Coffers sell on the Trading Post for 30+ silver each, so 14 of them is 4.2 gold before Trading Post fees.  Doing the other dailies will get you large amounts of Zhaitaffy, 400 a day.  250 Zhaitaffy sells for between 2.5-3 gold on the Trading Post.  It's easy money that you can get regardless of your level, and you'll get extra Dragon Coffers and even expensive Jorbreakers for completing other festival-related achievements.
---
So go and do that, and you'll get a fair amount of gold for the investment of time.  That will allow you to keep stashing your crafting materials for the future.
---
wHAT iN oBLIVION iS tHAT???????!
---
&gt;You know why all of this failed? Because ArenaNet fucked it up - neglect and mismanagement.
---
Agreed 100%.
---
Gw2 has all the right systems in place, but it went to waste because of nerfs and power creep.
---
HoT was even marketed as being the "hardcore PvE" expansion.  Before people cried, Verdant Brink was tough as nails. I have fond memories of grouping up with other players to traverse the zone. And then the meta events were difficult too. Chak Gerent had an entire community based around it because it was such a hardcore boss to fight.
---
To compliment all othis, they designed a guild hall system. But it wouldn't simply be that you paid gold to get a guild hall. You had to actually do a really tough event with multiple people in order to free it fro Mordremoth. Ultimately you had to face off against one of Mordremoth's Lieutenants, like Axeemaster.  (For some reason this wasn't repeatable though...)
---
Last I recall, raids were only properly introduced to the game weeks after HoT.
---
&gt;Raids are meant for hardcoreplayers.
---
mate i dont know what the fuck youre talking about!
---
you get utter trash players into raids, people with boosted characters in soldier set - guys in green and blue items with healingpower fill for dps roles.
---
i fucking wish only *hardcoreplayers* could join in, but as far as that goes T4 fractals do a better job of filtering those out because you at least know that people in fractal lfg have at least ascended equipment to begin with!
---
since kp faking is easy asf and there so many tools to do so you really need to request titles, chairs and infusions (celestiel red, can drop too tho but its ultra rare - its more likely to be bought for 90kp; also it dropps only on arkk cm kill) to check if those randos actually know what theyre doing. 
---
&gt; Content made for 1% of the playerbase isn't keeping the game alive. 
---
would be cool if raid CMs were repeatable and raids overall would actually pay at least something, you get \~70g in raids on a weekly lockout and \~50g in daily fractals, raids really dont pay well.
---
you get bunch of noobs into raids since there is no entry requirement and some bosses are so brainded i dont get how groups wipe to them.
---
I've made a few Viper pieces over the weekend, and the results were quite good. I think I'll complete the exotic Viper set since it'll take a long time to get those time-gated materials.
---
My working theory is that when Kormir ascended to godhood, she didn't get all of Abaddon's magic (Abaddon was supposedly much more powerful than any of the other gods individually, but we have no indication that Kormir is).
---
Abaddon's death is why the dragons woke up when they did, as opposed to any other millennium, and they all got some of his magic.
---
Normally the dragons are what we were told they are, forces of nature, part of the cycle of Tyria, etc.
---
But *this* time around they're all hopped up on Abaddon magic and maybe just general magic leakage from the Realm of Torment during Nightfall, so they're all varying degrees of mad, in pain, aggressive, etc.
---
This also explains why Kralk was enough of a jackass to kill Glint even though he supposedly loved her *before* we started messing with the dragons and magic. The Hero of Nightfall messed up the dragons and the world's magic long before the Commander did.
---
Mordremoth just happens to have been pushed really off the deep end by these events, while Kralk was at least maintaining *some* sense of self, possibly due in part to the Forgotten ritual that was performed on him. They perhaps weakened the "torment".
---
If we had gone into Kralk and seen only the big "torment" monster, not hearing Kralk's conversation with himself, that would have all felt *very* similar to the Mordremoth fight.
---
I think as generic the name elegant is, it’s the best choice. It stands out to me and it’s clear in my mind right away what set it is. Often the name mist feels like it’s used a lot and I get blurry trying to recall which is which hehe
---
They're outnumbered a hundred to one, bullying isn't cool but why should Anet devote any resources to them?
---
Perfection
---
Where's *Weapon McWeaponface*?
---
Because hardcore players are ArenaNet's most passionate and dedicated fans.
---
Its funny, if you go on the ESO, WoW, or FF reddit, they say the same thing.  "Our game is dying!! Everyone is going to play the other games.  Gw2 does it right".  
---
Grass is always greener.
---
as long as its not anything to do with changing out gear or a new gear tier, there is plenty to work with here
---
I think heal fb has the least transition if you already played condi fb as a dps. If you got dragonhunter, you'll just have to get used to new tomes and new mantras. That's it. 
---
I think heal fb is awesome for fractals particularly and raids. People gonna be pissed off when it comes to raid talk cuz all they ever care to run is what the meta tells them too. But to me, all classes are viable in raids except meme builds. Lol. I mean meme builds work too but you'd have to be very exp in order to know when it'll be used and how to use those builds to their full potential, like healing boon thief in a few bosses (sound weird alright but works pretty good), or heal scourge on some bosses when the group keeps getting down too quick or die due to condis.  
---
As for heal scourge, I really don't recommend you run at all, speaking from someone who mains necro here. It's more for like the last resort where you feel the need to carry others. Unless you just really like how the spec and the class play out, then go ahead. Lol. It's just it's better to bring another support with boons to share and real healing than barrier. It looks easy but really need balls and knowledge to run, otherwise you're more likely to eat a kick on site when you bring to any group. 
---
If anything bringing a dps scourge is better. It'll help any group tremendously to bring in epidemic for clearing adds, tons of cc from your weapons, elite and f4 skill, passively support the group by cleaning condi with f2, and barrier.
---
Only support can do this and only following some very strict rules. In general, don't count on it.
---
Some of the toxic casuals I know are pretty old and jaded with video games. All they do is complain about everything being too hard.

It's a fair statement. I would like to think it that way too. I'm not crying wolf. Don't get me wrong. All I'm saying is things financially speaking have not been great for Anet these lasts months. And the population density has dropped critically as well (check the page that measure it. Can't remember it at this moment. I'm not at home). Let's hope they surprise us with an awesome expansion! Fingers crossed 🤞!
---
There's one right above your comment right now.
---
It's just kinda disheartening to have to seek out a dedicated group and schedule my video game time like a doctor's appointment just to play a particular game mode. I get that that's how organized group content works, but it's just completely antithetical to the "play whenever and however you want" thing Anet pushed for the game, and actually managed for pretty much every other game mode.
---
Those names are so generic, how about:
---
Dead Gamemode Weapon Set
---
Thanks For Nothing Karl Weapon Set
---
Just End It Already Weapon Set
---
GW1 Was Better Weapon Set
---
Do they buy more gems than the casuals? Total, not per person. If not then that's an entirely irrelevant point
---
Thank you very much for the reply!
---
The chicken itself is irrelevant. It's the ritual and altar that's relevant. And as I stated, it was brought up that the ritual is geographically locked to the altar (likely to do with ley lines or something), and is resource extensive.
---
We've not returned to Arah, so for all we know it was turned into that Priory lab and being researched, presuming that Arah is even safe enough to do that (keep in mind that when we did the Caladbolg Regrown quest, we were told that the Pact are still fighting a heavy battle in Orr).
---
This is why weavers have their downstate-lavafont. Actually saved us from doing Arkk cm again once.
---
Whiting wasn't a herald. He was corrupted after Zhaitan's rise.
---
The role of herald is solely to advance the wakening of the Elder Dragon. The one and only risen known to exist before Zhaitan's awakening this cycle is the Giganticus Lupicus.
---
You're thinking of a dragon champion that's leading armies - that's not what Drakkar's or Glint's role was. That's not the role of a herald, even if the Great Destroyer did lead an army as well.
---
We weren't told why, just that such is why it's not used again and again. The ritual itself is the resource intensive aspect.
---
It's more than just needing a dragon minion.
---
oh god, that was painful to read. but unfortunately stupidity breeds confidence, which he very much proved. had a similar thing on KC, the offchrono didn't want to tank but insisted I go above 1800 toughness. after some debate I just did, and lo and behold, he still had more. I just left and blocked him instantly. I use the block list to give people nicknames so I know when they join how bad it'll be and if I leave immediately.
---
No but we failed at .04% if I recall correctly, it's been a while, was one of our training runs that went particularly well. sadly we'd already gone a bit long and people were frustrated so I don't think we managed a kill that night.
---
In an ideal world, you're right. And fwiw I think raids are really cool, and I enjoy PvP. But Anet has limited resources, and those need to be allocated to what generates the most revenue. 
---
Also the body analogy doesn't really hold water because frankly, casuals probably don't care whether there are hardcore players. My bet is a lot of the people who log in for LW, come out for world boss events, or even farm metas don't even know raids exist. But damn do they still buy that Skyscale skin
---
If you have no one in your group providing quickness then your DPS is going to be very low in comparison. If you can, swapping to [quickness firebrand](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/power%20quickness/) would be a lot more group DPS. The [fractal build](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand) doesn't even need to change any gear from DH.
---
&gt; gilded 
---
Gilded means gold plated, or something like that.
---
Another inconsequential choice for the players. Choose from boring or irrelevant/generic names. OK, "Elegant" is maybe worse than "Mist Champion" in that it can just as easily apply to 10 other weapon sets, but yeah I can't be bothered to log in just to vote on something where every result would elicit a "meh".
---
I just laughed one of those laughs where you don't make any noise you just wheeze
---
Gilded refers to gold
---
I just recently started playing so I'm very much a noob, but I bought the complete collector's edition, and I very foolishly used an 80 boost on my mesmer in my excitement.
---
Where do I go from here? This game is so overwhelming in things to do and I'm scared that I've ruined my experience by not getting used to skills etc as I get them and am now flooded with skills...
---
The boost gave me an armour set as you all probably know, and I don't quite know what to do now, usually I'd think that I should be trying to get better gear, but I don't know where to start, lol.
---
Should I just stick to my personal story for now? I'd like to get started on acquiring legendaries as I heard that they take months to craft, but I assume I'm a long way away from that. I'd also like ton start HoT and PoF for a glider and mounts, but I don't know if I should stick to the base story first?
---
Thank you for any advice you can give! :)
---
Ignoratio elenchi.
---
&gt;It's likely Svanir was expected to perform a similar role for Jormag before he was killed.
---
Svanir's role was closer to the Disc of Chaos than the Great Destroyer. A sub-champion, basically. Drakkar fulfilled the role that the Great Destroyer did.
---
Do you happen to have any non-cosplay outfits? I would be interested in your armour combinations.
---
Any player that uses this method right now: 
---
pls don't nerf this
---
Since we have a neat 9 professions, three of each armour type.
---
How likely are we to see another proffession added in?
---
I hear ya, I was in that same spot at the beginning. You have to find a balance between hoarding and selling. Preferably, salvage any gear you get and won't use and deposit the materials to your bank, then try not to think too much about it and keep playing the game, do stuff you enjoy. Then, only when you **need** money, raid your bank and sell until you get just the amount of coins you need. It's a more conservative approach to "loot, salvage, and sell".
---
And read the other comment too, festivals are great ways to make money.
---
You mean those [VM trophies charted here](https://gw2lunchbox.com/IstanShipments.html) for value? No way! Couldn't be!
---
How about you come [here](https://discord.gg/86aeGms) and prove it to people?
---
(I'm only trolling a little, promise.)
---
Ulduar and Icecrown are the only "good" raids of WotLK. The rest was considered pretty bland, specially on the boss numbers.
---
Kind of. It no doubt caused some exertion, but compared to what e.g. Jormag did, it's pretty minor, and unlike the rest Zhaitan didn't actually leave the place it woke up at (granted neither did Mordremoth but Mordy spread out in a different manner).
---
I know, I'm merely echoing your sentiments lol.
---
Actually before release it was, they just rushed the release. There is quote from the gw2 manual (I think) that said something like 1/3 of the original Anet devs described themselves as "hardcore PvPers"
---
I disagree. Drakkar was encased in the ice and unable to act. There was no indication it was capable of or even attempted to move.
---
I'd say Svanir was exactly like Scarlett, She was "just" a Sylvari basic minion type but her ability to act on behalf of her elder dragon to aid in his awakening was effective. Svanir just got put down before he had a chance to do so.
---
So does LA although the better point might be people build with what they have. A great reason for why LA used broken bits of ships after the flood. A supposedly thriving city that cannot seem to manage to get any better building materials in 100 years is a bit more farfetched.
---
Those numbers are averages from multiple data sets running 2 metas, 1.5hr each. So three hours total. 
---
I ran a farm with the Community discord and had people send me their drop data, along with ~4 of my own entries, averaged that all together, and threw it in the google sheet you see there!
---
I didn't add a per-hour column for orbs, but it comes out to ~21-22 orbs per hour.
---
The open world PvP I am referring to generally has other features and definitely much less avoidable.
---
No need, once people stop doing Dragon bash and get to regular program the prices will plummet a lot. It's this high mostly due divided playerbase
---
Thanks a lot for the detailed response, and it was likely chronophantasma indeed that gave me that impression (and I did not realized that different phantasm may have different lifespan).
---
I truly believe keeping it as simple as the original variation was would have been best. As I mentioned, less is more; people using raidar aren't using it for the colours and there's a great deal of skew for percentile data. 
---
Archiving or flat out deleting some of the logs should have reduced some strain. What I noticed was data stemming back all the way to 2017 for instance. That data is no longer relevant. At most, I would say the last 2 balance patches are relevant to keep. It feels like the UI/UX was designed for mobile in mind where as more often than not for stats like this you're going to be accessing from desktops.
---
It's not just promo videos that are cringe
---
You'd probably want a pretty beefy episode (if not more than 1) to flesh that story out, and again, that wouldn't really fit with where the story is taking us now.
---
How would you even apply that kind of law. Doesn't make any sense and I highly doubt it really exist as you imply it.
---
Yah, we were low on people sowe did have that prestacked first 2 runs just nothing for the last burn :C
---
Don't have a commander's tag, nor do I know the raids well enough to command them. I know what my class is responsible for in the raids I have done with my guild, but that's mostly it. I realize it's unfair for me to demand someone else step in and command when I'm not able to, but what's the alternative? Watching Dulfy vids isn't sufficient, so presumably the answer is to join a training guild, and again I don't want to make an appointment to play my video game.
---
I don't blame raiders in particular, I wouldn't want to waste my time with people who don't know what they're doing if I were in their shoes either. But I feel this game mode is just not consistent with the design of the rest of the game, hence so few people actually playing it.
---
&gt;training runs don't fix anything for casual players. Several months of training is hardcore.
---
Most training raids I've helped get the kill within an hour.
---
&gt;GW1 "raids" could be done successfully on first try, with a Pug, without reading any guides or do training.
---
Ummm.... what? I think you're wildly misremembering how difficult those were for inexperienced groups. 
---
&gt;"Join training guild" is exactly what I said is nonsense.
---
You have 5 guild slots. You literally don't even have to join the guilds. You can just join the discord servers. 
---
&gt;No, I'm not against difficult content.
---
And yet you consider "GW1 "raids" could be done successfully on first try, with a Pug, without reading any guides or do training." to be good design. If it were true (*and it's not*), that wouldn't be difficult content. You quite clearly *are* against difficult content if that's your bar.
---
John Oliver literally has to do 2 versions of a UK story because he can not make fun of parliament. Like I said youtube videos may fall through the cracks but its better people know that its a thing.
---
Most of GW2 is casual but with its gameplay mechanics you can potentially create some amazing hardcore content, and not capitalizing on that, if Anet can, is silly.
---
Your first point doesn't make any sense.
---
Yes the build templates have been confirmed in the last video.
---
I sincerely hope you're not a dev on some throwaway account. Because this mentality is exactly what's wrong with the direction of the game right now.
---
The Giganticus Lupicus are a race from the age of giants. It's not a singular thing and the one in Arah is just the same as Withing, risen when Zhaitan rose.
---
Here I thought they'd tie in the Djinn-themed raids into a Mystic Forge revamp, but at least for the time being that doesn't seem to be the case.
---
Just the hammer
---
thx for the answer.

[Kralkachocolate](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kralkachocolate_Bar) ?
---
well, there are friendly atmosphere where new raiders can experience raids and they are called training groups, noone is going to yell at you in training groups unless you are failing on purpose which some new raiders do indeed do, some people want to raid but refuse to listen to the experienced
---
Nope, just a semi-casual player. My wife is similar, a bit more casual but she's still made a couple legendaries and keeps up with the releases. She didn't know what raids were until I gave them a shot with our guild, and neither of us really "aspire" to be like hardcore players. GW2 is something I occasionally do to relax with a couple drinks after work, and it seems like that's a common sentiment
---

if anything we need Mordremarshmellows
---
IMO start another character and level that one the normal way. I have a [general guide here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Start_Here) (with links to many other resources as well). Just focus on exploring and doing story to start then you can look at proper builds for game modes you're interested in and starting gearing for that. Don't worry at all about legendary weapons/armor as that is a very long term goal for a new player costing thousands of gold. The best thing you can do is get set up to do content and work on unlocking elite specs and mastery when max level.
---
There's a difference between advertising it as good for PvP, and the focus of the game being PvP. The fact is that there was just never a very large PvP team. To be quite honest, ArenaNet's advertising around PvP was outright deceptive pre-launch. They *did* make it seem like it would be a priority (not over PvE, mind you, but well supported at the very least), but it never was.

On a more serious note:
---
\- Definitely a bigger story/campaign than HoT/PoF
---
\- Boss Specific loot maybe? - unsure on this one
---
\- An easier way to manage builds
---
\- Something interesting to happen with the domain of winds/tengu. Whether it's to make it their home city if they become a playable race or to have some sort of campaign/LS associated with it. 
---
\- Return of a GW1 style Fissure of Woe and Underworld. Especially since Balthazar is no more and Grenth left Tyria with the others so it will be interesting to see how these events affected these places.
---
\- Return of the [Hall of Heroes](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Hall_of_Heroes) in some interest way
---
\- New Class? My vote is for a Battle-Mage or a Rune Mage / Rune Knight or another unique class like the Mesmer is to Guild Wars
---
\- News Elite specs are always welcome - but I would think that these make it hard to come up with unique and different future classes?
---
\- Mesmer Elite Spec that turns it into a real Spellcaster / Chaos Mage like it was meant to be that I fell in love with in GW1 and not this stupid "duelist" thing it is now (biggest heart-break when GW2 released).
---
\- Continued Improvements to WvW. I don't see them doing much with sPvP as it has too many issues currently and would require a lot of time to strip and re-balance.
---
Its on the wiki mate, https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blue_Orb. And while they never stated it works with other minions, the fact that they use it in more recent camps such as the ones I mentioned, kinda proves it does does it not? Otherwise what would be the fking point in building it .. to look pretty?

oh, darn.  I had come up with modremallows, too.  darnit.  oh well.

They are just trying to drag players into the forums. Well they tried I guess.

that in itself is comedic

I'm personally tired of all this Mist this, Mist that; I want the gilded set.

I hope you realize that the wiki is written by players. That line was [added by an IP](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Blue_Orb&amp;diff=1180892&amp;oldid=1080508) who's sole contribution was [that one edit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special:Contributions/71.183.128.154). Without a source. I've never seen such a source, as the lore we have on those fences pretty much comes solely from Arcanist Slizz.
---
Yes there are several pics on the forums now.

Yeah, raiding is miles from the impossible wall some people make it out to be. You have to be at the top of your game, obviously, but you  don't need to be a top 1%-er just to get through.

Half-Life 8 confirmed?
---
Hm I get your point but coming from a very old game (World of Warcraft) ive seen the abyss that opens with "Looking for Dungeons" and "Looking for Raid" also several difficulties really does not help either way!
---
I guess you look into the matter yourself since LFR escalated extremely in WoW!
---
Make more per hour just working a decent job, getting paid, buying gems and converting lol
---
Forgotten Weaponset.
---
real world gambling exploits people even though it's regulated, problem with games is gaming companies exploit children due to lack of regulation
---
where is the Sodium-Encrusted Weapon Set option?
---
it is true that in other games i have shamelessly spent many thousands of dollars. one was perfect world international, $7000 on pay to win gearing over 3 years.
---
another was SWTOR. 4k in lootboxes for cosmetics. i only left that game because endgame gearing went into rng crates (that you only earn playing)
---
when i came to this game i swore i wouldnt lootbox, but i had to buy utilities and expanders. "useful" microtransactions... that hooked me into spending money in this "free" game. because lets face it, the inventory and bank is too small, shared inventory slots are so useful 
---
once i finished each story i'd look at my character and think i could make it more shiny, my skins were bland, the dyes were bland, skrit run around saying shiny all the time so i must get more shiny. the mounts are so ugly. the environment is so pretty but my character was ugly. 
---
at first i didnt buy lootboxes, just gemstore skins, but there arent enough weapon skins in the gemstore, theyre all in lootboxes and those tokens that take a slot in the lootboxes are useful to save up and buy weapons with. i'd have to buy hundreds of lootboxes to get enough tokens. i'd hope something i didnt want or need would also drop so i can sell it on the tp because gold is useful too. 
---
i have now spend maybe 3k in the last 3 years of playing.
---
TLDR: the game makes you bland and ugly on purpose, gives you no useful utilities or space to hold stuff, the npcs yell "shiny" all the time, we all yell fashionwars 2. the devs get fired so we must support the devs. downtime between chapters makes you look around and see other characters fashion and you get ideas to fix your own.
---
if you play this free to play game you are being constantly bombarded subliminally to spend money to fix it.
---
&gt;Drakkar didn't need to move. It had telepathic powers. It's explained in Edge of Destiny that Drakkar spent years preparing for Jormag's rise by basically repeatedly doing what it did to Svanir.
---
sure, But those abilities don't offer much in the way of feeding magic to a dragon.
---
&gt; Svanir was never given orders to gather magic, unlike Drakkar. He merely set out to kill things. 
---
He barely had a chance to do much because he was killed much sooner than scarlet was.
---
Ah, you're more educated than I am. Oh well. Thanks.
---
&gt;     Content made for 1% of the playerbase isn't keeping the game alive. 
---
Yes it is. Have you not seen the twitch streams? Things like raid competitions generate buzz in the mmo community.
---
When people come from other games, the first thing they ask is: "How's endgame?" and "Are the raids good?"
---
That 1% of the playerbase is helping the game's outreach and bringing in new players. They are teaching people how to raid, how to optimize build craft, and how to make the mechanics more interesting that these players stay. This 1% is helping to grow the game.
---
That isn't to say casual players don't help too. But rather that there is a relationship between the 1% hardcore players and the 99% casuals that is extremely important to the health and growth of this game.
---
&gt;No fixing required
---
Whatever your intentions, you could be read as trivialising the issue. Even in summing up the video the extra words I inserted are important.
---
I think I’d rather see the wizards tower as a raid or story content. I feel like we wouldn’t get much lore if it’s just turned into a guild hall
---
As someone who just started doing some of the LW4 stuff, how is VM such a high percentage of the total income? What are you using it for that turns around into so much money?
---
too bad anet dont care about the most important aspects of mmos, that are guilds and social features
---
Probably August for the anniversary sale

rumour has it some people share the same first name on this world :o

woah those are awesome.
---
At least they developed content that was 
---
&gt;[intended to be the super hard, very coordinated group style content](http://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/gw2-interview-with-colin-johanson-on-dungeons-and-underwater-content)
---
before the game launched.
---
But apparently that never happened and the developers intention was always a purely ultra-casual game.
---
Yo, Mai Trin was hard back in the day. Especially before the power creep.
---
Don't diss the Captain. She's baddass and can woop some ass.
---
I need to commission r34 of Mai Trin someday.
---
While that’s true in fractals/raids, for open world I actually prefer mainhand dagger because you get wayyy more quickness uptime out of the 3
---
Original Lion's Arch.
---
Wish I could just buy the keys
---
I hadn't actually seen that you were a different person, so fair point there. 
---
If you find it terribly worthwhile that people post low effort posts that end in all-caps "fix your game", while considering people who voice annoyance about such posts/attitude terribly toxic , I can't do anything about that I guess.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I agree, I think something is wrong internally. I think it's the combination of workplace and corporate politics clashing with one another. I feel like the corporate blend of NCSoft and ANet has them all frazzled. NCSoft trying to instill efficient protocol but being too robotic about it. Anet not knowing how to properly maintain balance of productivity, healthy work environment for employees and keeping players happy. I think both NCSoft and Anet heads need to get their shit together. Work out a custom blend of policies and management. While aiming to provide a healthy work environment for their developers and producing a quality product over maximizing SHORT TERM profit . But meh...
---
well, it is a 2 handed sword
---
Should try Healbrand sometime. I can go an entire CM100 without dodging 'cause all the aegis. It's by far the most effective lazy healer I've touched.
---
And you are still too dumb to understand that mist also is used as a word for scheisse in german. maybe your college was also "mist". kack armleuchter...
---
If you feel the content is saved for expacs, that's most likely the content they were hinting at.
---
Mai Trin 50 was a joke. Mai Trin 100 after all the fixes they did became a lot harder. But there’s so many different ways to mitigate damage and keep yourself up after POF that I would assume it’s easier to do now
---
&gt;When people suggests stuff like Story Mode raids, the hardcore population jumps to tear them appart. 
---
If tear them apart means saying it should give less to no raid specific rewards then sure.
---
That is the main thing raiders said so far, easy mode is okay as long as you need to do raids normally to gain the prestige rewards. You probably like to see what you want to see.
---
Why would a raider care if there is an easier mode so ppl can learn better or see the story by playing that? They dont
---
On other hand casual ppl dislike the idea of hard content that rewards something because they feel left out and rant against it non stop. The logic doesnt fit both ways.
---
I just started playing again after a number of years away.  I was playing as a Power Reaper and was working my way through HoT.  I just switched to trying a more Power MM Reaper.  I kill things plenty quick but I feel REALLY squishy.  I have full Valkyrie armor with Zerker accessories and Weapon.  I'm not sure if I am doing something wrong.  Any help would be great.
---
As a second question I was thinking about picking up the second expansion this weekend, how's Reaper vs Scourge for general use?
---
I think the biggest downside of how GW2 is monetized is that nothing has prestige value. People just don't give a shit about anything.
---
Mounts are the best example of this, it was a huge mistake not to balance mount skins evenly between the game and the gem store. Hell, purposely restricting dye channels on default mounts is already scummy as hell. You're willing to sacrifice the aesthetics of the game by making it look worse quality than it is, just to get more gem store money.
---
I think the way to go is bundles, where you get ton of stuff for like 10€ a month. Then reduce gem store prices in general, because they're far from "micro"transactions. I'm talking 0.5/1/2€ stuff, not 10/15/25€ like we have now. Steam and Humble Bundle make shit ton of money like this, and you get to free yourself from the whims of a reduced number of whales.
---
Most of the gem store is overpriced ugly stuff which negatively affects the overall game. It's not healthy.
---
Find yourself a guild. Ask 4ppl do do Fracs and dungeons with you. Tell them you want to see the cinematics. Done. 
---
It all depends on the people you play with. I have the same workload every week with shifting times and didn’t miss a single thing. My main Raid time is 10 pm, I just founded a guild around my playtimes and never have any issues.
---
Replying because I too would also like a copy of the data :D
---
God Damn you hitting me with the feels, that reminds me I should go back and visit Reeva
---
So a Guild Hall of monuments XD, also I agree, I want more interactive decorations, I was thinking the other day about the things in beetle races that replenish the yellow bar, the could add that as a decoration and buy it with the tokens, instead we have to rely on skill 7 to go fast in guild hall races
---
I know this is a light hearted comment, but a Kryta like guild hall would be great. Still holding out for a cantha one (please)
---
&gt;Generally the type of person who would gamble their paycheck away, won't really care how long it takes.
---
That's not necessarily the case. Compulsive people are most likely to fall into trouble if the event in question happens quickly. Although they may gamble continuously, if the maximum bet is £2 every minute, that's a maximum of £120 an hour - without stopping. Although it's a fair bit of money, it's not enough to bankrupt someone. There are also increased opportunities for them to stop themselves or a friend/family member to find them and say *"hey, let's stop this - you don't want to relapse"*. Intervention isn't possible if they can gamble £100 a minute, or £6,000 an hour.
---
&gt;There's not really regulation that is going to prevent gambling from taking someones whole paycheck, outside of flat out making it illegal. 
---
See above. The UK has already made it impossible to gamble large amounts of money via fixed-odd betting machines in short periods of time. I see nothing wrong with this.
---
It's because the Mystic Forge was never originally intended to be a pseudo crafting mechanic with mass production. It was always intended to be used for high end rare crafting or gambling.
---
The big pop-up is designed with legendaries or high end exotic skins (like Foefire weapons) in mind, not crafting superior arrow carts or upgrading crafting materials.
---
The Mystic Forge was designed for gambling and high end crafting which makes sense to have the big pop-up, but it ended up having a lot of mass production uses which make less sense. It would make more sense to me to move a lot of the mass production stuff over to crafting professions.
---
Your first point isn't based on any solid grounding. Easier difficulty fractals do not have their own distinct reward structure yet people still play them and are encouraged to continue playing until they reach the "proper" difficulty, and greater rewards, in many cases. You could easily have reduced rewards for easier raids - maybe 1-2 LIs per wing, no ascended skins, no titles, less gold, no achievement completion. This not only allows players some sense of reward but actively encourages difficulty progression - something raids lack entirely - through necessitating completion of normal mode should players want to make use of LIs they gain. As
---
Secondly, I also agree that raids are relatively easy. However, I'm able to understand that my viewpoint is biased and coloured by the fact that I'm probably one of the 1%, sitting comfortably with my CMs and leading training initiatives. I'm also aware that the production of easier difficulties inherently costs less than challenge modes - it is a numbers tweak to simply tone down damage output or boss health. More resources are needed by CMs - new animations, new programming routines, new mechanics, new models - yet that only appeals to be a very small section of the playerbase. You give no good reason why catering to this portion of the playerbase is in the better interest of the game. It doesn't make better use of existing resources (those players already do normal mode) whereas as an easier difficulty does and, with more players in a mode, it is easier to justify continuing support for that mode.
---
We do not need something that is "new" at this stage. We do not need some highly contrived game mode that is intermediate between raids and fractals and would necessitate entirely new resources. As a community, raiders would be better served by both an easier mode to encourage new people into the game mode and also repeatable CMs to retain players. With an easier game mode, the difficulty can also be ramped up - as highlighted through the implementation of fixed 20 player mythic raids in WoW following the introduction of the easier "flex" difficulty.
---
should just make them purchase-able imo.
---
I understand your point, I just wonder about the how?
---
9 elite specs. How? In one episode? Spread across 6? Which profession gets it first? 
---
New zones, traditionally 4 per expac. 6 LW zones. Roughly 10 zones to implement.  2 zones per episode, seems a bit odd. These are merely speculation and rough guesses mind you. 
---
Not even considering new mechanics / features and numerous other tweaks to existing game formats.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against the idea. For some reason I'm being down voted into oblivion for merely wondering "How?"
---
If they do implement it, what's the point of expansions I wonder?
---
They keep the game alive mostly though. It is always a big deal when a big raid guild or before raids dungeon speedrunning guild closes or quits. Why do you think that is?
---
If you remove all the content coming from people that play this game in that way, you'll end up with bunch of the majority that is bored and dont know what to do and they'll quit as well. It is a chain effect.
---
This is my opinion of course but i simply don't think it is as simple as who buys gems :)
---
I play for the lore.
---
Been picking up and dropping the game since launch as well.
---
So much better than the abomination that was the Obsidian weapons.
---
New community name confirmed
---
Muy eleganzaaaaaa
---
This Taming was just a little naming joke.
---
Actually we don't know much about Malyck because those story part was cut out. Maybe he was corrupted, maybe he was "sleeping agent" ready to lure pact to certain death. I still believe that Ventari was just a lucky coincidence. Tree was adapting, growing, trying to "fit" into the world so taking human form for Sylvari. But there was a good centaur, who had it's words of wisdom. All that Tree knew about the world came from those. As a side effect, following Ventari words, Tree developed strong will and autonomy, good enough to fight Mordy. 
---
About other Tree. Maybe it was somehow behind Mordy reach, maybe it was Melandru area that is proven to be resistant to Dragons. Who knows.
---
Man sure, watch this: https://youtu.be/1T_8cikp_tE?t=1677
---
I do think the easier fractals have a different reward structure than the harder fractals. You % rng is significantly less to get certain items, of which some are reduced to not being able to get at all. I strictly oppose giving LI for easy mode mainly for the reason that you get legendary armor through LI (but I do concede that it’s not entirely through LI). 
---
My viewpoint is not from completing CMs or doing training initiatives. It’s from playing other MMOs and comparing relative difficulty. The reason I think we need a higher difficulty is not for catering to more elite players, it’s to present the current tier of difficulty as normal difficulty that can be completed by everyone. But again, I emphasize that the reason the average player cannot complete the raids is due to how the gameplay outside raids are. Looking at dungeons, if you can find a party, they’re easy to complete but they aren’t necessary. The average player learns the game through open world content, of which can be completed by standing at any location, auto attacking and, if you die, you can wp and/or be rezzed without any penalty. All of these make players play inefficiently and, to be frankly honest, bad. Even fractals don’t require players to play well as it can be cheesed through support characters (barrier/heal spam). Nothing prepares the PC to play correctly and, the worst part, is that the community and company has this overwhelming support to play however you want and there’s no wrong way of playing, which is distinctly the wrong mindset for new people joining raids.
---
This might be obvious, but have you tried turning computer off and on?
---
Ok, so you have all content of the game downloaded even before expansions, so that can't or rather shouldn't be the part of it.
---
Have you only tried logging into the same character on the same map? Might be a faulty instance.
---
Are you by some chance using 32bit launcher? Is that even supported still? HoT maps take more ram than core ones, you might be running out of memory as in physical or 4GB address limit of 32bit applications.
---
This for me is the hardest pill to swallow tbh.  The gameplay mechanics, the combat system, so so much potential for absolutely amazing hardcore content....wasted on "press f to gather skyscale egg"
---
these orbs will be worth like 15s in some weeks...
---
Not how (most) people work. Most of the CMs are already more fun, yet how often to you see Dhuum CM weekly groups? People don't want to put in more effort for the same reward.
---
[Hmmmm...](https://i.imgur.com/h6VSWNW.jpg)
---
A full restart of my computer is the one of the things I haven't tried. 
---
I only have the one character created so I haven't tried with a different character. 
---
When I attempted to download the 32 bit launcher I checked my files and still had the 64 bit. I'll try restarting the pc. Thank you for the help
---
Well you do want 64bit, just checking, because right around HoT release it got obvious we needed it, because of crashing.
---
Hmmm did they mention these will be upgradable, or am I misremembering?
---
i'm saying they did
---
maybe some fools are jumping on it and someone (OP?) doubles his \~15g
---
Only if you do it more than once.

Abaddon was the god of secrets. its not a far stretch that his acolytes before his fall from grace with the other gods, collected secret scrolls of magic of all kinds. It wouldn't even be a stretch to speculate that Khilbron him self was a follower of Abaddon. In secret of course, but for a god of secrets. that is just common sense. If he was high enough in the secret Abaddon club in Arah. And being a Vizier, he prob was. He had access to the clubs secret library in the supposedly abandoned but not really temple. You know the one, personal story has you swimming through it.
---
If you would compare them then yes they are more toxic, but not MOBA games levels of toxic, but it's mostly just banter. 
---
WSR have more commanders than FSP (because of all the guild stacking) but in players on borders when there's a tag up i'd say they are pretty equal
---
&gt;do people here like being exploited?
---
No, they just think that the so-called whales are all rich people with money to burn. I.e. they're ignorant and don't realise there's a good chance these people are being exploited.
---
The hardcore community, and it's attendant attitudes filters down to the rest of the community.  For instance, the finer points of class balance rarely matter to a person running meta event chains or doing personal story, but I guarantee that they have a vehement opinion on them because they hear through the grape vine that "XYZ is totally broken and matters more than oxygen right now!"
---
The people who put long hours into the game, and are this most likely to be raiders, high end PvP'ers, or WvW commanders are also the ones who run websites, twitch streams, and YouTube channels.  Without those people a game truly feels dead - whether or not its player numbers substantiate that.  Find a game that has mostly negative or non-existent coverage from fans and you'll find a game whose average player is in the process of leaving, regardless of if they tend to find the day to day gameplay enjoyable or not.

&gt; As many of us remember Guild Wars 2 was always about competitive game modes
---
Eh.. no it never was.
---
&gt; What happened to you, ArenaNet?
---
What happened to your memories? :P
---
GW2 always was a casual based game, from the begin on.
---
It's gonna explode in their faces if they don't wake up quickly. Lootboxes will be getting the banhammer internationally pretty soon.

They can't just do an account rollback?

People don't go through the same raid 200 times for fun. They do it for the carrot. It's not nearly as fun after dozens, hundreds of times. MMOs are based on repetition and rewards, so give us the latter *in the game* .
---
Any fiery GH would do fine for our guild, as we got the "[Burning Isle](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Burning_Isle)" one on GW1.
---
So a new GH in the Ring of Fire would be great ! And there's still unused room over there ! :D
---
If not, a GH in the Depths of Tyria, with the [Fire Keep](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blistering_Undercroft)'s assets from the Red Desert Borderlands could be awesome !
---
Or even, if we go north ~~to Vabbi !~~, in the Blood Legion Homelands, a GH in what's left of the [Catacombs of Kathandrax](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Catacombs_of_Kathandrax), since [dwarven](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Derelict_Delve) [assets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dwarven_Catacombs) are already in game too, it'd be really cool !

Anyway, in the meantime, we [torched](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infernal_Facade) the Lost Precipice GH, and [it looks quite good](https://i.imgur.com/TbxuECx.png) :D

They replaced an infusion for me in the past that. Ask to escalate the support ticket to a higher GM. Keep escalating and provide as much evidence as possible, such as your completed achievements etc.
---
Essentially what could have happened here is that someone has some kind of information about an upcoming patch that would greatly influence the demand for a particular resource which is why someone would invest gold now, wait for the price to go up massively when the changes occur and then sell for a massive profit. Another thing that could happen is someone is just taking a long term position on a particular resource and buying it now with gold they have but do not want to invest into another long term asset (such as gen 1 precursers due to them rapidly going down in price from being crafted at much cheaper than current selling price) and then just waiting to see whether the price goes up in the long term. An alternative could be that someone is attempting to artificially create a demand by spiking its price in the short term. Other people looking at the price increase could think they are missing out on a potential goldmine would invest their gold but the initial person would then sell as soon as it becomes profitable and the others are screwed cause the demand increase was artificial and now they cant unload the items at a good price. This is normally referred to as a pump and dump scam. although as pointed out in other comments this equates only to about a 15gold investment which is peanuts for someone who would want to really manipulate the market in a meaningful way
---
It's interesting how this discussion is rolling here. A lot of the dedicated community and long-standing content creators in WoW absolutely despise the amount of dungeon and raid difficulties and would prefer a single difficulty, even if it meant that a lot of people would never clear certain things.
---
All i got from them was:  
---
" Thank you for contacting Guild Wars 2 Support regarding your Infusions. I truly apologize, but due to the rarity and cost of infusions, we are unable to provide another one for you. In order to prevent duplication of items, we're unable to replace overwritten or otherwise lost Infusions due to Stat-Swapping. It is important to pay attention to all of the in-game warning prompts and stock-up on Infusion Extraction Devices.  
---
I know that this isn't the answer you were hoping for, but I do hope that you will let us know if you need assistance in the future. We're always here to help our valued players, such as yourself, with whatever issues you may face. "  
---
Which, imo, seemed like an automatic answer. Then i send another message and got:  
---
"Unfortunately, even though we were able to provide replacements in the past for some specific cases, in this case we would not be able to. I know this isn't the outcome you were looking for, and for that I apologize for the inconvenience. "
---
&gt;On other hand casual ppl dislike the idea of hard content that rewards something because they feel left out and rant against it non stop
---
I feel this part is particularly true.
---
I've done the exact same thing recently (overwrote a red polysaturating infusion with power stats) and I was told the same. Basically the ticket got moved to a different departement as I was told because the case was too complicated for the person who was in charge of the ticket first, and after a few days I got told they were not able to verify the mistake and due to the price of the infusion, would not be able to return it back to me. 
---
Now mine wasn't unique so I just left the ticket feeling a little dissappointed and 700 gold less richer than before, but your case seems quite a bit worse.
---
Yeah, thats what i thought. It's easy to just check i earned it but don't have it anymore. And you get so many delete confirmation messages from items like.. weapon skins, black lion salvage kit, kinda odd how theres only a 'yes' and 'cancel' button on the infusion/enrichment swap.
---
But this is talking about Anet providing another infusion. They may not be able to give that one but they certainly are able to do full account rollbacks to a certain time period.
---
nobody wants to hear that theyre being exploited
---
I once bought 3k shallots. Where is my post?
---
Is there a TLDR or a written form? Not sure I have the time for a 40 minute rant by Jim.
---
Well.. true, but that was liek 2 days ago, it would roll back a lot i think
---
Eh, SWTOR has 8 different class stories with different branches and different endings for each one; it doesn’t really combine into a singular story until after the core game with the expansions. GW2 is certainly not the most advanced or unique when it comes to branching story that has “effects” on later content.
---
Speaking of the  mini mordremoth in Kralk, that was annoying how phase 2 for some reason has a condition damage immunity. Why Anet, why.
---
I would want buildings with rooms, council room, Library, tavern, outdoor gardens, stables, some open space to fly around, and day and night sky, no random rocks, to get in decorators way.

So I'd say that you need to be looking for tells for when foes are about to attack: there are a lot of things you can prevent with [blind](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nightfall) (attack misses) or [block/deflect of projectiles](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Death%27s_Charge). Look for aoes, avoid them. Things in GW2 combat can be very chaotic, and HoT adds to this by having a lot of ambush-y enemies (though, Show All Enemies can help with making those more visible.)
---
Scourge is a very different playstyle. For one, DPS scourge is more glassy/interactive in that it has barrier to actively spike damage resistance when you need to avoid damage instead of a shroud second HP bar and the summonable pillars for doing damage. For the second, there's a support variant which can be effective in groups. The tradeoff here is that the gear for all these things to be effective is very different. If your gear is good for reaper and you want to swap I'd probably stick with the reaper/its gear while you earn different gear. (And if you were planning on gearing support, keeping the power gear for open world since power is very effective at doing dps vs healing stats, and generally good for open world as well.)
---
Am I the only one that collects one of these every time I do the fractal and just stores them in my bank? Sort of a tribute to good old Pre-Searing Ascalon.
---
Except speed running doesn't really give an advantage except time.  This gives, as stated, "up to 100g an hour".  And they have banned people for encouraging mass exploitation of unintended mechanics in the past, particularly when that exploitation leads to very high rates of gold gains.
---
So players who already clear the content regularly and don’t find it too difficult can now make it even easier for themselves? Meh.
---
Show me a screenshot.
---
You definitely **don't** know that.
---
Yeah, it's scary.
---
still got no idea how to get lots of karma or volatile magic. i need those just as much as gold.
---
Non-bugs can also be exploits, and ANet has banned people for exploiting even non-bugged mechanics to gain significant advantage in the past.  You may not agree with it, but the RoC does allow for it.
---
Yeah, just wanted to be a living example of a healthier relationship with GW2 lootboxes. Last time I bought keys was 2018 august sale, that was 100 keys and I still sit on 50-60. Just to give you a scale idea. Maybe I would've bought more during the year but chest contents/rotations barely interest me lately.
---
What are you on about I'm saying Claw Island should be a guild hall because theres nothing to do there outside of core story.
---
as a power reaper you'll probably want to think about changing out the staff for a more power oriented setup like axe + warhorn/focus.
---
as for the squishy factor, try to trait into some sustain like Soul Eater or the blood magic tree.
---
&gt; Non-bugs can also be exploits
---
Yes, I stated that in the first two sentences of the comment to which you replied.
---
5Head
---
Fully agree, GW2 is one of my personal games to point towards as an example of a game that is *worse* because of micro-transactions.  
---
Mounts are worse because of the cash shop, in-game goals are worse because of micro-transacations, etc etc.  
---
Hell, Anet abuses these artificial scarcity and "anchor" deals as much as any other company, it's disgusting.
---
Speaking of monuments, Anet owes us a Kralkatorrik statue.
---
Except speed running DOES give you an advantage in gold gain because that time saved allows you to make more gold. Time=money, and they can’t be considered separately.
---
staff is a pure utility weapon, utility that is almost entirely useless in pve. take axe/wh for some actual range/single target burst, and life force generation if necessary. as general advise you should move away from minions ASAP. they are clunky and do more harm than good, and relying on them forms bad habits (i'm aware that certain raid builds use some, but those are optimized for sustained DPS, which in most cases is irrelevant due to how quickly even veterans melt).
---
scourge is a strong support, and decent condi spec with a lot of tagging potential, which can be rather useful in OW content. outside of end game content imo reaper is the far stronger and more useful spec due to its low skill requirement even on full offensive gear, and the very strong AoE burst potential that can easily eliminate a full group of veterans within ~5 seconds.
---
just try it again, maybe you approached a gm in a "bad mood" or something, in general they do give you those things back, even if it can take a little time and some messaging back and forth
---
Yes. I don't know how many speed run maps I've gotten stuck on, resulting in not having enough keys for the boss run. Leaving loot behind sucks.
---
I pronounced the last one like a [welsh ll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ll) making it something like "Khhghink". (though its hard to write that sound phonetically)
---
**Ll**
---
Ll/ll is a digraph which occurs in several natural languages.

Whenever I see them I think some texture is missing. The black-white tile texture just looks so much like a placeholder.
---
Probably. There's still a lot of grinding for me to get to that level, since I have to build up agony resistance, but at least I know there's something to grind for now :p
---
Yeah. I hear Stockholm syndrome is good this time of year!

---
&gt;kvortabrak
---
But then where's the runningbrak?
---
What would be a decent build to try?  Just the cookie cutter build online or something different?
---
I main power Reaper in PvE.
---
For one, the minion build you see recommended everywhere is a meme. People on this subreddit love it but it's just bad. The Death and Blood Magic traitlines are useless unless you're going for a full heal Scourge build. It's fine to have a couple minions on your bar, but basing your build around them is suboptimal.
---
Traits should be Spite/Soul Reaping/Reaper. Choose the traits that increase your damage. If you are unclear which ones exactly, just reply and I can help you further.
---
Gear should be full Berserker's with Rune of the Scholar or Eagle. Axe/warhorn + greatsword with Force and Impact Sigils (you can sub in Energy Sigils in place of Impact if you feel you need more dodges).
---
The point of all of this damage is that you will kill most enemies before they have a chance to damage you.
---
Remember that you have an extra health bar. Pop into Reapershroud if you think you're about to eat a bunch of damage and let your lifeforce tank it.
---
And most important of all, you have to know when to dodge., especially in HoT content.
---
Eh the point of the current design is to make it so people play the full map instead of just piling onto it at the boss fight, I think that's fine and like OPs suggestion better.
---
Please go and suggest this in the forum, so devs can see it. The participation system in hot is so good. I don't know why it wasn't used afterwards.
---
As I've said I'm thinking of newer players , I've been here 6yrs with 9.2k hours lol.  The game does a poor job at offering tutorials for newer players . As I said they need to incorporate it into the story along with fractals, dungeons ,WvW, PvP ect.
---
Do you have a link to a build by chance?
---
You're looking at collections the way they are in other games.  In this game, collections are the questing.  The exact same exclamation point over the NPC questing that is in every other game, just instead of turning ten bear asses in to an NPC you're doing it through a UI.
---
Well, what can I say. You can even design simple infinetely scaling ideas and get downvoted into oblivion, so op has a point.
---
And just making cms repeatable won`t change too much at the top end, since people will adjust to those in time and that will be that.
---
I for one still do not have the skyscale, and neither am I upset about that fact.  I'll take my time getting it cause I can't be arsed to spend the hour I have every day obsessively farming map currencies.  One set of hearts a day per map is fine, despite having 21 level 80 characters that I could knock it out in one day.
---
&gt; Guild Wars 2 had PvP as an afterthought, with a very small dev team and missing crucial features at launch.
---
Do you forget how hard they pushed sPvP as an eSport until they finally accepted that it was never going to happen?
---
I love shields and I cannot lie! But I cannot leave my little shooshadoo baby alone... :/ struggle struggle struggle
---
Not at all a cryptid thing. The *vast* majority of players are like you, either paying nothing or only only spending reasonable, affordable amounts on occasion. That's also the narrative the games industry would *really* like to push right now (particularly and explicitly EA, with that whole 'surprise mechanic' farce). Some, or even most, people find the mechanics fun, so that means it's a good system, right? Unfortunately, that fun comes at a *huge* cost for people with gambling addictions, *especially* when companies ramp up the psychological manipulation in an effort to hook less-vulnerable people into the system.
---
GW2 is certainly less predatory than a lot of other games, but it's important to consider not just how *this* game affects *you*, but also the ways it could negatively impact others, and the ways it can affect everyone if taken to an extreme down the road (either in this game or in others).
---
A build would be really nice if you could link me one. :)
---
As a reaper you have plenty of defensive options:
---
Greatsword 4 pulses blinds, a super powerful defensive condition, Reaper shroud gives you a second health bar, you can trait to siphon health from your foes, minions can sevre as a meat-shield and last but not least you always have 2 dodges(necromancers limited access to vigor gives you fewer dodges than other classes thought). 
---
Employing these defensive mechanisms while killing your foes as fast as possible (so they can deal less dmg overall) is your key to success. That said HoT simply is quite a bit more challenging  than vanilla gw2, especially in the open world. Some encounters, including some hero points can be challenging to the point where people who are not very comfortable with their class often have trouble completing it on their own.
---
I've spent about 250$ in the 4 years playing the game. I bought the initial ultimate pack that was 100$ because I knew I'd enjoy the game when I started playing. Needless to say it is possible at least in gw2 to not spend a lot of money. However there are cases  where collecting everything is a hobby people enjoy, especially when they think an item looks cool. I considered collecting everything in the game I can, but decided to stop that collector's mind set my first year when you need black lion keys to do so. What helped me not spend too much money on this game over time was realizing there are only a few prestigious items in the game cosmetically to get. Such as getting legendary raid armor, raid wing 6/7 chairs, PvP legendary armor, wvw legendary armor, red celestial infusion, and a few other things. I love the outfits in the gemstore and some black lion weapon skins, but just knowing to get them is swiping your credit card or gold farm in a map for so many hours makes me think the value of that cosmetic is garbage tier. I do agree that the game makes you initially ugly to get you to spend and annoying with limited inventory space. I also had to buy space, but not expensive. So, I hope by telling you all this you reconsider buying gemstore items next time when they aren't prestigious to show off. 
---
Especially mount skins in this game. None of them show you did something in the game to show off. Skins like the starfall set looked amazing at release, now they look like garbage because everyone purchased it. Hope things get better.
---
Literally bought 2 inventory full of rocks.
---
I deserve a post too.
---
&gt; Generally the type of person who would gamble their paycheck away, won't really care how long it takes. Minutes, hours, days, doesn't matter. They will gamble the whole thing away.
---
That seems like something that would need a study to back it up.
---
it's one of the easiest healers too, staff 4 is really good for topping people up, and pop F2 and barf five 1 in a row on the group. Save for the occasional F2 skill 5 for condi clear, it's all you really need to know.
---
Maybe a bit off-topic -- if every dragon has a herald, what do we think Bubble's is at this time? Have we seen anything that fits the bill for it?
---
Qadim the Peerless will stay alive at zero point zero percent indefinitely if there's an add tethered to him, that was fun to find out the first time I led training on him on launch week Sunday night 😂

A failed journalist that has since shifted to making big patreon bucks by pandering to the gAmErS RiSE UP demographic with endless outrage-bait videos. Similar to other channels like YongYea.
---
Hmmmm. Now that is good info.
---
Let's see if I can convince someone to let me try it....
---
&gt; Some game, some businesses, some product will always try to find a loophole. 
---
How is that a justification for not trying? There's no reason you can't both have regulation *and* try to have support for gambling addiction. Both would have positive impacts. Providing that support can even be *part of the regulation*.
---
Welp I’ll be making my way over to Dragonfall now lol
---
[This](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vRAQNBhOD7kjGodTslGwxGgeTskLYQBgGwKIeKmFHjUlh3QzC-jxRBABUq+DAPEA80NY8FAQjjAgZKBva/R5X7gDAf91Xf91XNgXf91Xf91Xf91XBA-e) is the exact build I run.
---
Scholar Runes are expensive so go with Eagle until you have the extra gold.
---
You can use any heal you want, really. I use the Blood Fiend in most raids and swap between Your Soul is Mine and Comsume Conditions in open world depending on what I'm dealing with.
---
You can also get rid of You Are All Weaklings if you don't think you need a stunbreak and sub in Shadow Fiend for more dps/lifeforce.
---
You can also sub out Bone Fiend instead of Chilled to the Bone if you want more frequent CC and a little extra dps.
---
But if you do decide to get rid of the shouts, swap the Augury of Death trait out for Chilling Nova.
---
And since you're having troubel with survivability, pay attention to the Soul Eater trait in the Reaper line. It heals you for 5% of the damage you do while in melee range. You can heal for quiet a lot if you Reapershroud #4 on a large group of mobs.
---
Presumably whatever filled the role for thr DSD is near the DSD and thus unseen by Tyrians like the rest of anything directly related to the DSD.
