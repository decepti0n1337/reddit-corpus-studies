&gt;  You still have to get Amalgamated Gemstones (which don't drop in PoF content) 
---

---
No one was non-crafting them anyway. At least when you want to do it in less than a year.
---
---
---
just collections or is there crafting?
---
I just googled it and it was available April 2018. So it’s been over a year. Definitely gonna watch the game release notes from now on, want it so bad!! https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/35746/game-update-notes-april-10-2018
---
But it looks like just tracking on map, no materials needed, right?
---
Is that how all 21 are?
---
Is it all jumping puzzle related?
---
fetch quest
---
Some people were speculating the reward for Troublesome Skyscale is actual access to the mount. Is that he case, or is it after the final achievement?
---
So no materials?
---
Any more Timegated Collections in this one? (I don't unlock it until tomorrow)
---
Please tell me there is not the Ember Bay one.
---
more jumping puzzles :(
---
What is the reward?
---
is there any material to craft? or just collection?
---
Its jumping puzzles, mini dungeons, and 2 world bosses (Shadow Behemoth, Inquest Golem) plus the branded Ley Line Anomaly in Vabbi
---
You can destroy the volunteer popup by *volunteering* for command tag and lfg people in.
---
I mean... he talked to/around us for maybe 30-ish minutes compared to him, as far as we know, *never talking in 10+ years*. it's not like we have a good read on his personality in its entirety over his lifetime. **p.s. tl;dr at the bottom**
---
hell, I don't think anyone really understands *why* his physical representation went around gobbling up magic and Branding things, whereas his mental representation hated everything that was happening.
---
this is why Kralkatorrik and Aurene are unique. until very recently in the lore of GW/GW2 history, Elder Dragons were only thought of as destructive but inherent forces of nature and its balance. likewise, nothing/no one ever presented us with the idea that Elder Dragons *could* be benevolent, or even neutral. Jormag actively attacked Kodan settlements, Zhaitan set traps and attacked non-magical areas to expand its influence, Mordremoth attempted to cripple modern day infrastructure and expand its influence in a show of fear. Primordus attacked the Domain of Winds because GW society really doesn't like the tengu, I guess.
---
but ol' Kralkyboo and Aurene were *different* - they proved that, at least sometimes, Elder Dragons can be *forced* to do things they'd morally be against. we don't actually know why, either. we went into Mordremoth's mind and he didn't seem very conflicted. Zhaitan just seemed like a beast backed into a corner.
---
tl;dr the point is that we don't actually *know* what the Elder Dragons are, their origins, their mannerisms, personality, goals, moral compass - any of these things. all we know is that the last time they showed up, they om-nom-nomed all the magic they could and that life on Tyria is nigh-impossible *without* magic.
---
The map is just the best and I hope ANET can create a better map than this one. Good job team!
---
Some are JP some arent. This just unlocks 1 psrt of the actual Achievement like how the previous AP are, complete the thingie to unlock the next part of the achievement.
---
All i’m seeing is that Game of Thrones mobile app add where you’re growing the dragon baby in steaks lol.
---
Ember Bay is LW Season 3, so there is a 0% chance its needed for it.
---
Bitterfrost was only in a Collection because it was an alternative to Claw of Jormag.
---
Uh, why would they leave before meta, when end of meta is guaranteed bridges destroyed with new map?
---
epic loot
---
Keep us updated please
---
Ah, true.
---
Of course the first thing the baby decides to do is scale some jumping puzzles.
---
As a note, you can use the "Spearmarshal's Plea" item to go to the Sun's Refuge from anywhere at any time, so you don't have to go through the WP. Minor thing, but some people might appreciate the bit of convenience during feeding :)
---
[Oh, shit, here we go again](https://www.twitch.tv/mightyteapot/clip/BloodyInterestingWaffleKappaWealth?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time)
---
Also this is the first out of 5 mini collections for the 4th collection...the other ones are hidden (with the last one prolly being return to gorrick)
---
Hover over a piece of armor, and below the rune information, should say "transmuted xxx" if the skin is different, or it should have the name of the original piece of armor, which is a different name from the regular ascended armor sets - Like the PvP set is Ardent Glorious.
---
technically yes if you craft your own charged quartz (20 required in the first step of 5)
---
It's actually kind of impressive that they designed this and thought it was a good idea.
---
is there anything that can be bought on the TP? Want to get in before prices skyrocket :(
---
F
---
Despite being an old engine, I still think this game looks decently nice.
---
#Rage.
---
Most people don't give a damn about the gold it's the Charged Quartz nonsense (to me anyway). It's pants-on-head.
---
Tomorrow is my day 6 , finale day of feeding lol
---
but ... but ... but ... This is C O N T E N T
---
Right?
---
\+
---
Yes, and now there's another 20 needed bringing the total to 42.
---
the bonking on the head is the lore reason for why you cant ascend forever, it needs to rest cuz it developed light headed syndrome while growing up lmao
---
Funny you should say that...
---
It's not the gold sinks for me, it's having to wait another fucking month of logging in to charge up quartz crystals unless you can buy this shit off the tp. Imagine not stockpiling an outdated material that hasn't been relevant since the mawdrey collection in season 2 and now getting punished for it. They could at least allow you to acquire the crystals from the new map so people actually play the content.
---
Personally, I don't have a problem with gold sinks. What annoys me is simply the Charged Crystal requirement.
---
If they had chosen materials we can actually *farm*, then I wouldn't really be bothered. Even if it was 50 ecto per and therefore required 1k ecto total, it wouldn't bother me as much as the charged crystals, because I could at least make progress toward that requirement.
---
Now, I'm fully controlled by either daily-only acquisition (making the charged crystals myself) or people who happened to have a bunch of charged crystals sitting around that I'm buying from on the TP. That's the part that's super annoying to me; not the overall gold cost or the fact that there's a gold sink.
---
If you think people on the TP are going to be selling them for 5g each, think again. Either you buy them for the ~10g they're likely to be (which would total 200g for this step), you wait 20 days making crystals yourself, or you simply don't get the skyscale yet. That's the part that feels crappy.
---
Do you guys not have charged quartz?
---
you happen to have a translated one?
---
What do you mean exactly? Like, if we get the food items, we don't have to do the jumping puzzles and dungeons and bosses because the hatchling is attracted to the treat or something?
---
You use the item in a map and it unlock that map's objective in the collection.
---
So the mount is now under a 42 day timegate from Charged Quartz alone.
---
Fantastic decision, Anet.
---
i crafted a full set of celestial literally a week before the patch dropped. so no. i do not have charge quartz
---
Got a translate for this?
---
Make no mistake! I like how they combined every mastery we had from S3 to S4 and utilized them in this map, we, old players definitely enjoy it ( I love it too! ), but to be fair, it is probably very NEWBIE unfriendly as they probably don't have every mastery unlocked and if possible, they will find it very difficult to reach some critical spot that old players can reach with ease...
---
I'm done trying to be reasonable with the fuckheads still defending this, just go to hell
---
Why cant you buy useful stuff with the new maps currency like idk... charged quartz... sell em for 100 each. Make it so theres a reason to not consume this shitty currency they gave us.
---
I have English one too.
---
You'll have to feed 200 charged quartz to your adult mount because it got a stomach injury from all the shit you've been feeding it
---
each Extra-pungent Skyscale Treat ist selling for 50g atm
---
You can also use the LS4 tome if you got the page
---
From the sounds of it, it is not a required item for the collection? You can use it to 'skip' a part if, let's say, you really can't do the jp needed for the collection?
---
5 ap
---
Has anyone finished the feeding collection yet ?
---
plz anet, why? this is really getting out of hand. especially since the reward at the end seems to really not that great... ridiculous :(
---
Part 5 will require us to feed a Chak Egg Sack to the Skyscale
---
Yes but expensive. It is called Extra-Pungent Skyscale Treat. 50g+ at the moment and a very limited supply as it looks like only people who have unlocked this collection can buy the smell-enhancing culture item from the vendor.
---
Is it tradeable?
---
Im gonna be honest. I sell raids and do speedclears, but if I meet two of those fucking smokescales alone I already know im probably going to die...
---
i had a lot of fun editing this :D i intend to take more screenshots of the realms at some point.
---
as for who built the statues i didn't think too hard about it myself, but malchior does make the most sense! it's really cool when you get up close and look at all the little details on them, there's a lot there.
---
Pretty positive you don't need the food if you read the description this just lets you skip a step of the collection on the map.
---
Lol yeah MMOs really arnt your thing. Personally gw2 is the only MMO for me that's really good.
---
Maybe story based ones are more your thing? Like Mass effect or dragon age RPGs things like that.
---
Gotta love the expression and the style, but the fontwork is a couple decades behind (:
---
Can you post screenshots to clear this up? A TON of people are outraging about having to spend 80g-800g+ and the crystal costs etc but if the food IS optional and you just have to do the quests? That would be SO much better.
---
Please post as much info as you have for those of us who are still behind - ther'es too much conflicting info going around and it's confusing D:
---
But you make it sound like MMOs are supposed to be about repetition.  That was never the intent.  Maybe that's what the genre has ENDED UP on, but there was a time when games like World of Warcraft and Runescape were about world exploration, and social interaction.  THAT's the kind of experience that Guild Wars 2 tried (and still tries) to bring (back) to this genre.
---
It's not required.
---
It is down to 34g now but that is per treat. The treat is optional though. If you do the collection by going to the locations then you don't need the treats.
---
Since I already got 6 charged crystalls I will just wait 14 days. 
---
Anyone who defends this collection is propably someone who already has a stack of them in the bank is making big profit.
---
Doesn't really count as trolling if it's Obsidian Sanctum
---
No this item is a skip for impatient people.
---
Don't you guys have home nodes?
---
Nice art.
---
Too bad it wasn't of a character of importance ^/jk^But honestly I do not like Joko, I'm glad he's gone and I hope it remains that way
---
Did anyone datamine the final collection rewards by any chance?
---
i sure as heck do now
---
Also, the Roller Beetle collection wasnt repetitively time-gated like this one is.  Face it: Arenanet is just doing this because they need to artificially inflate their daily login numbers since NCSoft is now glaring down their back.
---
Oh thank god, I don't have anywhere near that amount of gold aha.
---
It's not required, it's a way to skip doing the content.
---
ITT:  a lot of people who are comically impatient.  I mean come on guys, I don't like time gating either, but a lot of you are complaining about doing a collection, not actually time gating.  This unlocks a powerful mount, it should be challenging so that the reward actually feels rewarding.
---
People need to change their perspective. Don't think of this as a timegate. Think of this as new content added to do each day.
---
Good point, the final reward for roller beetle was an item called "Roller Beetle Mount Unlock", so there might be a "Skyscale Mount Unlock" item if it's not unlocked like the other mounts.
---
&gt;You can either do the Jumping Puzzle OR Make the Food. It's an item to skip the JP if you hate them. It is not required.
---
That would be nice. Can anyone confirm it?
---
This isn't "another day" added, this is just a sub-collction in the next collection.
---
You will need Elegies, which require Bounties.
---
You are also time gated by daily limit of obtaining the Crystalline Ingot equivalent 13 / day. You need 250.
---
wait if that is actually how it is , its actually reaaly smart and well done by arena net!
---
Ability to do the next and final collection at the next daily reset
---
Oh that is actually really great that the food is optional. I’ll do everything manually then and save on gold. 
---
I just have to take the leyline anomaly into high priority since it’s pretty much the most pain in the ass one. 
---
Mesmers are going to be the true MVPs of this collection.
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
&gt; you either do the collection manually **or** you can craft those items and skip it
---
200? Why hold back, 356 will keep players coming back whole year!
---
UGH. No. And I don't have much time to get this due to other bullshit.
---
Charged quartz stuff is optional seems like
---
You dont need it. It's an item that lets you skip doing the JP
---
Oh, the other thread didn't say that. People sure were complaining about that as if it was mandatory.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bqo422/troublesome_skyscales_collection_thread/eo65blc/
---
Collection unlocks it at any master chef vendor.
---
Chill friend, it's optional.
---
Again, as people keep missing it somehow, this is optional.
---
You are required to spend only 0g. That is not a typo.
---
The food let's you skip doing the Jumping puzzles. If you do the Jumping puzzles, you don't need to spend a copper.
---
&gt; Lol yeah MMOs really arnt your thing.
---
I honestly want to let you know that PvE in GW2 is barely MMO. Aside from fractals and dungeons (and you can even solo some of those), PvE in GW2 mostly doesn't require group play. Bosses? You don't get a choice in solo play for that. People just show up. That's hardly "group play". That's just random pugs. 
---
Now try roaming solo in WvW, which even I don't do anymore. That needs group play.
---
It never occurred to me they would behave that way. I expected those to be just thematized unlinkable waypoints.
---
It sounds like you might have another program running that uses W as a functioning key, and when you press it, it’s handing control over to that program.
---
thanks so much for posting the whole thing! seems like this collection isn't gonna be so bad. fortunately I have a lot of gold on me so I think I won't be fighting low frame rates during those bosses you have to defeat
---
I dunno, I enjoy these, and if you can buy, the time gating is really small.
---
Nope, nothing special. All the new items are listed in shaman's thread.
---
troublesome steps:
---
\- 21 part collectathon going through JPs and Metas, can be skipped with a recipe with charged quartz
---
\- Play fetch with skyscale on easy, medium, hard (exactly like the fractal ball bounce)
---
\- Hide and seek (i havent tried this one yet)
---
  
---
So looks like no timegates
---
why if you did youd be able to just afford em still o.O
---
PSA: the Skyscale treats in the Troublesome Skyscales achievement are OPTIONAL. If you want to skip objectives, then you will have to craft the treats.
---
thanks
---
This story wraps up so well, it almost makes you forget just how many unanswered questions and huge problems still exist in the world. But still, looking at that sight, I can't help but asking...
---
What are these beings who claim to be gods?
---
What do we do about the 2 dragons we killed without a replacement, or the 3 that are still alive?
---
Is all this loose magic going to attract something even more dangerous from the mysts? Such as those beings we see in the shattered observatory?
---
What the hell do we do now? Where do we start? Has our actions already doomed the world and this just delays the inevitable?
---
When can I see Aurene again?...
---
Feel free to pay the gold but the food is optional.
---
Well, I didnt. But if so, its more like gorging on a full bar of chocolate, no?
---
It drops lots of rare unid gear
---
Im loving the design of this.
---
How to craft it btw?
---
After hating arenanet for the timegating i am actually really proud of them, THIS is actually extremly well done.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You are rich and bored of doing the JPs? Just buy the food.
---
Your are as poor as me but dont min doing the Jps? Just do them.
---
Well played ArenaNet,you deserve big praise for this one 
---
i just hope the other steps are also this well done and i kinda get the feeling Achievment 5 will actually have us fly the Skyscale :)
---
Aww... I was hoping for both.
---
Just so there is more QQ on reddit
---
Marilyn Monjoko
---
The food is optional. Do the jp or lure it out with food.
---
Finding Gorrick is the third step after the JPs and world bosses
---
Didn't Aurene do stuff like this, too?
---
I mean, we feed her, play with her, get her toys, then she runs away, get her new toys she doesn't play with, runs away some more, comes back.
---
Then she dies, lives, kills her grandpa, and initiates Third Impact.
---
And apparently *Kralk* killed a parent, too, so at this point I'm just going to assume dragons just… do this.
---
Might want to keep a res orb handy, though.
---
Now that is a good info, thx a lot... it gets a bit of my rage off... can you share info about the entire collection ? or its just this one for the "troublesome skyscale" ?
---
I mean it's still possibe, it's only step 1 :D
---
I said something similar to this on the Skyscale megathread but thanks for posting it on a separate thread. We need to get this PSA through for the people all the way in the back.
---
The resulting chaos is what happens when you don't give context for what the recipe is for...
---
Nice to know now an hour later that the treats are OPTIONAL and only used if you want to skip out on the mini events. RIP people who spend 90g on one treat.
---
And invisible shoes.
---
The food is optional.
---
I was fine with the first bit of stuff, but the 13 collection egg thing overwhelmed me. I was annoyed with the previous one, but it was mitigated because I had charged quartz crystals stockpiled from something else. But now...
---
Don't forget you can use modifier buttons as well, so my mounts are bound to ctrl+1-8 in the order received.
---
By the time I will have time again, it'll likely be on LS24E5
---
I want this to end, now.
---
We'll only have to worry if the trees start developing pods!
---
Not to spoil anything but achievement 5 maaaaay involve some flying.
---
It's optional thank god. Treats are used to skip the mini-events/minigame if you do that. Otherwise, do the work and don't have to pay for the extra food (from what we can see)
---
is it just me or does the cost of these collections seem like an elaborately planned sink to combat inflation
---
especially considering the pungent treats are optional - those with extra gp will just buy their way through, those who are limited on funds don't need to be concerned
---
Food is optional.
---
Also just shows, we expect them to do that at this point.
---
Food is optional
---
Well yet the closing server gui can go off without switching servers, so *somehow* the people actually are getting into that instance...
---
Rob a zephyrite bank?
---
[](#s "1x smell-enhancing culture (4g from vendor), 1x charged quartz, 2x red meat, 10x bloodstone dust")
---
Its this one, then thered part of you playing hide n seek  minigame with  your skyscale, probs similiar to what we already have in refuge on easy, medium and hard difficulty, and then the same with catch minigame
---
Guild wars 1 never took itself that seriously.  All the henchmen and especially heroes were quip city.  Anyways, the tone they landed on in HoT and have continued to refine til now is much better than the really flat storytelling of the base game and s1-2.  I disagree that they haven't expanded the morr serious lore that isnt related to the main plot, also.  Stuff like Siren's Bay fully embraced it.  But here, a lot of the fun was that Elona has been cut off so long, everything is much different than we left it.  It makes sense that new things would be more important.
---
[removed]
---
One would be pretty sad that there is no race for beetles. Well, yea, it would take away from seriousness of the map, but would be fun to do.
---
PS: the sharp turn before olmakhan camp from south is hell.
---
I feel bad for anyone who already payed the insane sell offers instead of taking 5 seconds to read the item description.
---
I found a raven egg, hatched it, fed it, taught it everything it knew, caught 23 spirit ravens, fused it with my raven chick, then fused it with my staff in 1 day. Lore my ass.
---
What if some of the gods are some elder dragons’ champions, like, Lyssa is Kralkatorrik’s champion? Could this be possible?
---
no problems here on3 different computers, fully updated
---
What's the recipe for the treat? Mystic forge or crafting?
---
Someday I will establish my prominence.
---
I somehow feel like they changed it just before any1 got to see this collection, I feel like it wasn't just optional just few days ago.
---
My main question ofc is, are there any timegates like the last one? If not hallelujah! I'm knocking this baby out in one go!
---
The description is very vague, i thought you needed to go near them and feed each 21 sausages so they stay in the place as rental.
---
I only read bits and pieces, beside the optional food to skip collections, what do we need to do ? (completing events, killing world bosses, etc ?).
---
And a bonus beard for character development
---
They added an achievement for killing it long after I'd already done it... kinda glad there is a reason to go back at it now.
---
I'm imagining a Norn just bludgeoning people with dual wielded backpacks.
---
Woah... Source? A triceratops sounds so cool!
---
I could hug you
---
Gw2 is definitely one of those games that won't age with time thanks to its strong art direction.
---
https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/915203176978112513
---
same day
---
&gt; day 1
---
I'm on Day 2 myself, it's more so a general "everyone when they talk about this, should post all the details because of people panicing"...the amount of crap in map chat for the last hour before the full details about it being optional was released was crazy.  Misinformation and lack of information spreads so fast...
---
Good shit, I like doing the JPs and stuff so I'll opt for the free route, good they added a choice on how to do it here (and best of all no timegate!).  This part is a big step up from the last part
---
You don't need the food?  The Skyscale Food for Collection Day #3?  It is absolutely required.
---
PLEASE. the two little baby goatees we have right now are okay but what if MORE.
---
And also what a handsome heckin sylvari ♥
---
Spent some time doing a few events on the map on release day, got through one and a half meta cycles
---
Salvage all
---
125 ectoplasm
---
Except, in this case sylvaris won't be shaped as humans but as jelly fishs
---
They're already down to under 20g. I suspect they'll keep dropping to somewhere between 4g and 10g as people realize they're optional and others will surely be porting through the necessary jp's and dungeons. The champion Branded Ley-Line Anomaly may be worth skipping purely because you can't quite solo it easily.
---
what?
---
Can you skip the JPs with the food?
---
mount skins next week xD
---
I actually really like this one. The challenges seem very easy and solo-able, while giving players the option to just chuck gold at it through the food to complete. The other steps in troublesome skyscales have yet to be seen though (by me at least).
---
It really won't matter much until you're pushing "end game" content, and even at 80 a lot of groups (T3 fractals, dungeons of all levels, meta events) don't mind.  T4 fractals, raids, and farming runs will care a bit more, but those are things you'll tackle a few months into being level 80, not immediately.
---
NO ONE WANTS TO DO THAT THOUGH. Especially if it's ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED
---
Some folks just want to be angry at something, anything,  hopefully they can find some perspective and get over it someday...
---
Going to take that 80g I wish I had and toss what I can at the mesmers.
---
The Springer jump charges faster. I think the buff went live with the War Eternal patch and was just undocumented. The devs talked about it on the Skyscale preview stream.
---
Can we use it to skip the boss ? I really dont want to do that Anomaly in vabbi again.
---
&gt; Third Impact
---
Man, that cutscene would have been something else completely if everyone just burst into orange fluid.
---
yes
---
Perfect option for my PUGs then since I dont get quickness or alacrity there either XD
---
No problems here. Could you put one of your crash logs on pastebin? We might be able to tell what's wrong from looking at it.
---
Thx god xD
---
I love this!
---
non of the steps are timegated except for the world bossed they are on a timer
---
are you okay man
---
To be fair I had no issue assuming it would've required 20 charged quartz looking at their history, but yeah you're right.
---
Elder dragons are not really independent entities. They are mantles of power. Slots in the Tyrian ley line scheme if you want.   
---
It makes sense that these particular dragons are not the first to be holding those positions, just like the current generation of the human gods are not the first to have their powers.
---
I think it's the same person that says that in map chat in Lion's Arch EVERY DAY. I've seen that statement said at least 3 times this past week. -\_-
---
The time scale is off by tens of thousands of years though.
---
ANET: What does the community want?
---
COMMUNITY: We want content.
---
ANET: HERES YOUR CONTENT
---
Wish the afterimage was on Whirling Wrath too.
---
yep.. sold all my ecto already in anticipation.
---
good art. 
---
never want to see this shit in game tho
---
Yay! Much appreciated &lt;3 I'll be making more as I continue through my collection for each day.
---
It's the better option even if you don't like JPs... there are going to be a lot of people porting.
---
Try doing fractals.
---
What's funny is that this particular screenshot tells you literally nothing at all.
---
For the 2% of the players that might have finished it?
---
Returning player here! I've been going through my account and such and have noticed that some items are not showing up for me despite it showing I should have them. Example: I completed the achievement to obtain Mini Toxic Nimross, but it's not in my mini collection, birthday items, etc.
---
Any ideas on how I can obtain these 'legacy' items?
---
Thank you!
---
There will always be another sale. So take your time with core game.
---
They always used to. Haven't been there in a while though.
---
Joko could also be lying, like he always does.
---
Next step of the Skyscale quest line seems to be this:
---
Go around and interact with your skyscale in various tyria/pof/lws4 maps. You must complete JPs and kill 3 different bosses, shadow behemoth, mark II golem, branded ley-line anomaly in vabbi.
---
The JPs:
---
    Cursed Shore - Buried Archives
---
    Caledon Forest - Spelunker's Delve
---
    Metrica Provice - Goemm's Lab
---
    Harathi Hinterlands - Fawcett's Bounty
---
    Frostgorge Sound - Shattered Ice Ruins
---
    Fireheart Rise - Rebel's Seclusion
---
    Lornar's Pass - Griffonrook Run
---
    Timberline Falls - Coddler's Cove
---
The PoF/LWS4 locations:
---
    Crystal Oasis x3
---
    Desert Highlands x2
---
    Elon Riverlands x2
---
    Domain of Vabbi
---
    Jahai Bluffs
---
    Domain of Kourna
---
    Sandswept Isles
---
Or optionally use extra-pungent skyscale treats to autocomplete by using them in each map available:
---
Extra-Pungent Skyscale Treat Recipe:
---
    1 smell-enhancing culture
---
    1 charged quartz
---
    2 red meat
---
    10 bloodstone dust
---
You can get Smell-Enhancing Culture for 4g each from the chef vendor, meaning you need at least 80g for this step if you want to skip it.
---
Second step:
---
Talk to Gorrik
---
Third step:
---
Play a hide-and-seek minigame with your skyscale on easy/medium/hard (I assume similar to the hide-and-seek minigame with the children in Sun's Refuge)
---
Fourth step:
---
Play catch with your skyscale minigame on easy/medium/hard.
---
(No info on this yet)
---
Fifth step:
---
Oh my god. That means Kralk's "mother" line was talking about *Joko* who is inside Aurene, because Joko raised him *like a mother*.
---
^^^^kidding, ^^^^ofc
---
It's a cooking 300 recipe.
---
Why are they farming bridges?
---
?
---
Better than literally just saying "wait an arbitrary amount of time and then talk to this character to complete the task..." Oh wait...
---
&gt; You can bypass the 80 gold minimum requirement to buy the items to craft the food by **playing the game**
---
AN OUTRAGE.
---
(actually laughing, nice).
---
Given that the Skyscale collections occur after Kralkatorrik's defeat, and one of them requires speaking to Soulkeeper, I feel like having her be canonically dead at that point in time would be a bit of a glaring plot hole.
---
If I had to guess, s/he is raging at the concept of having to do a jumping puzzle more than once every 2 years.
---
a great compromise would've been to let it as it is right now..but add another reset when the daily changes
---
some of us would like to use it on parked alts but can't because of the way the timer currently works
---
Sorry, I didn't realize more food was involved with another collection.
---
People have already mentioned WvW so I'll mention Fractals, Raids, and choosing a legendary weapon to craft. Choosing one with a good crafting questline is really rewarding, and some of them reward you with bonus items! (Mounts, parts of map you can only enter by completing questline, etc.) There's a lot more to this game and sPvP barely scratches at the surface of it all.
---
Once you've done that, just open the achnevement panel and start looking at some of the collections: again, there are parts of the map and puzzles you haven't seen before and you'll be amazed at just how much there is to do beyond the main storyline assuming you've just done that and pvp mostly.
---
Regarding WvW and PvX, check out r/GuildRecruitment and consider making a post there to find a guild that will help you get into more content. There are a plethora of different types of guilds; Farming ($$$ making), raiding, GvG fighters to name a few. You'll likely move through a few guilds until you find a group you like to run with and that has a good schedule.
---
Best of luck!
---
They have had that since the original launch of the game ...
---
Maybe a student of Master Yoda?
---
Jk,jk.
---
Have a cry

People cannot be auto-assigned to a closing instance, but they can absolutely join through a party or squad, and if the population increases enough, the instance will stop closing.
---
Are you in a  group or a Zerg?
---
In a Zerg, spellbreakers have a critical role - stay on pin and break out winds so that the bomb is as destructive as possible.
---
Then do your best to stay alive and contribute damage until your winds is up again.
---
Depending upon what you like to do, you can use warhammer for the earth shaker - really strong aoe CC. Greatsword is a great way to finish off downs as well as do a lot of damage.
---
The thing to remember about a Zerg is that everyone has their purpose. Honestly even if you stay on pin and blow your bubble and then get ganked shortly after, you’ve done your part. 
---
Me, personally, I focus on sustain with my warrior build. I’m not going to be able to out damage the necros, but I can take a beating and survive.
---
Another underrated thing you can do if you build for high sustain is operate siege. It’s way easier to keep heavies up on rams and such.
---
I’d also suggest finding a good guild on your server and talking to the folks in there. They’ll help you along the way.
---
And you know that if Mordremoth could attack the Mother Tree in the Grove, it could attack anywhere.
---
Arebtbthose more like the o9ze flowers in Rata Sum/Metrica?
---
&gt;orange juice.
---
FTFY.
---
Here come people trying to justify this garbage
---
Oops sorry, I'll edit
---
Fetch quests that are time gated is not content.
---
Is it possible to cheese most, if not all, of the JP with mounts?
---
Maybe they could add it in as a 'celebration' thing following a successful meta, while the ley-bosses are going on?  
---
It could reward 5 or so keys, maybe, as a nice little 'catch up' for people who have too few to open all the chests from the bosses.
---
why are you bothered with them?  
---
this farm doesnt give that much gold or affects the economy that significantly
---
It doesn’t. 90% of recent Thanos memes don’t tie into endgame/Infinity War
---
They still do. Tried it today
---
although I wouldn't want to grow my own mount, i must admit the collections are a great way to play other content. if masteries were a reward for upgrading your mount i would have had a stronger connection to them such as I do for the Griffin and probably the skyscale but these time gates are such a bad way for me to get hyped. if only the final collection was a timegate I would be fine and hyped to get it but every single day having one feels more of a drag and grind that I've lost the motivation.
---
You can't send gold/items from free accounts, and if you spend the money to buy even one expansion for each account, that's a lot of real money sunk.   
---
Plus how many people actually have the temperament to spend significant amounts of time afk farming this way?  
---
And as others have said, the impact on the economy is negligable and the impact on you as a player is likely nonexistant.
---
Boon chrono has probably best shield skills. If you play that build with very offensive stats (berserker armor + pack runes, diviner trinkets) it does pretty okay dmg while offering nice utility on top.
---
All other builds with shield in PvE are very much more supporter. Heal firebrand for example.
---
I don't regularly run events as a commander, but I tag up on occasion when there isn't one.  I've never received a tip.
---
I do, however, regularly get tips when I portal people to JPs/Mastery Points/etc. on my Thief.  Which I always find silly because my Thief Portal has a 30 minute cooldown, but it often seems to land a gold or two in my mail.  Makes me wonder how well all those Mesmers are doing. ;)
---
It would be best used offensively on engineer with the Holosmith elite spec. Check [this build,](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Holosmith_-_Power_DPS) and reference the note where it says,
---
&gt; You can run Sword/Pistol and replace Bomb Kit with Rifle Turret.
---
Except use Shield instead of offhand Pistol, and whenever the guide references using Bomb Kit skills for filler, use Sword instead.
---
Reality Tears... LMAO.
---
I wish they could just open the gate to the nearby map. I miss the feeling of interconnectivity in LW S3 and 4.
---
Nice gear!
---
The egg collection nearly killed me - running around for the third time on the same map searching the same spots ... masochistic. But the rest is pretty decent for what gw2 engine is capable.
---
And Id argue that it doesnt quite make sense to force feed your skyscale to instant juvie years -&gt; see my heavily downvoted reddit comment on that ;p
---
Because having to put forth effort to do something is exactly the same as not being allowed to have it, right?
---
I understand the frustration, and I think it's totally fair to be of the opinion that the effort required isn't worth the  final reward (or isn't fun), but can we stop exaggerating to ridiculous proportions? 
---
This step is jumping puzzles and mini dungeons and bosses. There's no timegate for this part of the collection at all, and you don't have to spend a single gold on this step if you don't want to, either. What more do people want, other than to just be handed a skyscale with no strings attached? (And that's fine if that's what you want -- I just wish people would be honest about what they want instead of claiming that's not the case.)
---
Since the phantasm rework, you really can't sacrifice offhand sword or focus as a DPS chrono, or your burst and sustained DPS drop hard. Best would be Holosmith, it sacrifices the least DPS to bring sword/shield instead of rifle.
---
I didn't even realize there was a food available to craft. I went through everything manually like a peasant.
---
This is the worst collection/content they've ever put out. This is so boring and obnoxious.
---

The Elite skill is slapping them on the forehead. 2s knockdown and full heal. "Be Healed!"
---
Yes yes yes yes yes
---
Thought this was Fjord at first
---
Oh no... that's probably not good...
---
Honestly, if you WANT to play a boon revenant, then play it. This game is all about setting your own goals, why do it with a class you don’t want. Every class is be viable, some will excel at certain modes more. Plus I’ve never played a game that is more alt friendly, so you can have multiple classes for different things.
---
This whole skyscale collection is the worst thing theyve ever done. Even hardcore korean mmos would be ashamed at the grind
---
I'm sure some people are having fun with it, but to me, it's so much that I have no plans to do it.  I can't even think of a time where I'd need it either.  Would consider it if they axed the timegates alltogether though.
---
I barely use my teleport to friends item, so even if the rechargeable teleport to friend item didn't have a recharge, I don't think I'd use it. 
---
I think the 1 hour recharge is a bit over the top though. If I wanted something that has unlimited uses, I don't want to have to wait to use it again.
---
Yeah. Not Really.
---
They merely hid the tracks when you haven't unlocked it yet but this doesn't change that you still won't get exp with the next locked track or when you don't have enough mastery points to finish one.
---
So more like a workaround that is bound to repeat itself but still a good thing that they addressed it.
---
I'm not sure making the game use DX12 will improve the performance at all, but I will look into it. I don't think the GTX 1070 is particularly well known to run DX12 well. More of an AMD thing as far as I know.
---
If you have an empty character slot and a friend parked somewhere.. you can just make a character, use it, do whatever such as gathering, grab a chest or what not.. delete and repeat.
---
A return of the ecto market
---
I know, right? I think we've all been so conditioned as players to wait till we're out of combat before clicking on any waypoint or shrine, that to do it whilst still in combat, feels so unnatural, and forbidden, almost. I wonder if this is a bug, or intentional, though. Seems too good to be true, if it's intentional.
---
&gt; * Jump from high with griffon.  
---
* Flap Once, then once endurance is full..
---
* Press Dive immediately.
---
* While diving, press Space for a speed Boost.  
---
Changed it up a bit, but the rest remains the same.  Doing a pre-flap before diving gives you more room to use your Dive if you have   a smaller space to work with.
---
Agreed, I forgot that part.
---
There is one purple litelary called **Branded** try that one out
---
Exactly, beetle was fine but this is like beetle collection on stereoids
---
the exchange rate changes from time to time and it depends on how many players are converting gold to gems   
---
400 gems right now is 135g   
---
s3 is 900 gems which is like 300g   
---
if you log in now you will get e6 of s4   
---
and the season 4 pack is 25% off so i assume it will be cheaper than s3
---
You mean like slaying 3 elder dragons and a exiled god?
---
I learned about this when doing some Griffon adventures.  And that boost took forever to go off and by the time it did I was already heading nose first into the ground.
---
Those builds are very cool and will see more love in fractals. It's a weird niche that can work in raids but you may have a hard time if you're pugging. Revenant is a super amazing class though! They can do everything!
---
The one peice of advice I'd give you is to not worry too much about various builds. Find something you enjoy and get good at it. The meta is ever changing so you should make decisions based on what you like to play.
---
URGE TO KILL RISING
---
Wait, we could buy them????
---
I know that I haven't fully done the meta because I want to unlock the quartermasters first. I would kind of have preferred it if there'd be more of an additional (and visible) incentive to keep on doing events.. well and if ArenaNet had done a bit more to introduce the map meta (for example via a mini storyline taking the player through the meta once).
---
Not that that is at all necessary, but personally I have a tendency to focus on unlockable objectives such as the vendors and the mount collections first and foremost and it'd help me to pay a bit more attention (because I do like a good map meta even if I do not prioritise it). So maybe it's just me?
---
The commander ate to much bloodstone dust and now pees in glorious auroras
---
Agreed.  But then it would be easy to abuse each hour by just cycling all characters after it resets on them.  (Assuming preventing abuse was the intent of the debuff)
---
Same here.
---
Thanks
---
TBH idk what specifically could be abused since I've not given it any thought before now.  More speaking generally to concept of using 2 accounts, one with like 20+ characters and the other at the teleport destinations (let's say up to 5).  You can then (over 5 hours) cycle 20 characters to 5 spots bypassing normal requirements reliably with little effort in an infinite way.
---
Just sounds like a can of worms to me that they didn't want to open and thus what we have now.
---
My preference would be account wide CD over what we have now - but we'll see if they take any of the feedback and change it at all or not.
---
its not widely used but i have been apart of several runs with support and dps type scourges and they did not suffer greatly for it. Its not the fastest but with a decent player at the helm it does as good as any other pug. This if for reg T4s and cms btw. Same goes for reaper.
---
It makes literally no difference for condi slb. One Wolf Pack is power damage, condi soulbeast is condi damage. The minor difference between One Wolf Pack and Entangle isn't going to save a group struggling with seekers, actually use your brain and think a little. Entangle will help them much more.
---
And go yell at whoever wrote the guide for Condi Soulbeast - who btw almost certainly knows more than you - on VG.
---
Agreed. I'm thankful he lived, but he definitely has lingering or perhaps even permanent lunge damage, sadly :(
---
Your personal skill shows big time with any kind of necro for group content. If you are a so-so player you will be better off playing more meta classes. If you are a good or better player you will do just fine on necro for most pugs.
---
Ty, so dev confirmed.
---
You should try an invisible bag. For things you don't want to deposit/sell/compact
---
You can only carry one of the two so if you pick up dragonsblood spears, you drop the embers.
---
Everyone has a portal, if they have the White Mantle Portal Device.  Just with a thirty second cooldown.
---
I like to advertise an incoming ThiefPort when I use it to benefit strangers, just to confuse people and prompt responses like yours here. ;)
---
You have too much ferocity
---
What is impressive here is that the map + story = perfect conclusion of the game. Even the last chapter is named "epilogue" in french. Everything we earned and learned from previous living world charters, since the very beginning in 2012 got an end here.
---
If there were not Bubble hidden somewhere and our wish (for some of us at least) to explore far, far north and Cantha or a very new land... Well we could almost say goodbye and farewell to Tyria. 
---
It's a weird feeling to think that this could perfectly end the journey now. It's almost like if devs have no clue about how to keep going with the story. And I don't know where the clues are hidden for the next things to come.
---
ppl  nowadays want every thing by just pointing at it
---
So I'm thinking about (slowly) working towards my first legendary. I'm debating between Nevermore and Xiuquatl, as my 2 most played toons are tempest and daredevil. From what I see, it seems like Xiuquatl takes more gold, but Nevermore has the Raven staff which is a lengthy collection set. If any of you have crafted these, which one is generally easier or less time-consuming?
---
Ah, I thought it was a device, but wasn't sure if maybe thief got a specific thiefy one that I didn't know about.
---
[deleted]
---
Sadly if there is events during meta and they give decent rewards either
---
1) people do events and ignore meta because BeSt GoLd GaInS
---
2) the incentive isn't good enough so people complain and flat-out refuse to do events during meta, leaving people solo elites and veterans.
---
3) it spreads People too much and metas fail more often. Or take double the time it takes now.
---
Current system is "best" one. All focused on meta and reset happens afterwards.
---
Pirate Ship meta - now with actual ships?
---
s a m e.. did it hard way!
---
You'll need to rely on passives to sustsain through the damage and support from your group. You won't be able to run up into 40 people and not pop instantly otherwise. Gear is not as important as playing properly (and no, not just you, your entire group has to play properly, including having firebrands and healers heal you up and keep your stability strong); that's why most Warriors in strong groups play in Marauder or even squishier gear. You can definitely start off tankier to get used to your role as Spellbreaker but understand that the best players can play in DPS spec and survive simply off group support and immunities.
---
If you're playing berserker without going full DPS then you should probably go spellbreaker. Berserker only serves the role of doing dumb amounts of DPS, but you need the right set-up to do so otherwise you're going to be another blip on the DPS meter and offer little support to your group 
---
otherwise.
---
&gt;if Mordremoth could attack the Moth~~er~~ Tree
---
You made a typo.
---
SS/55 DUO RUN
---
Which part of the story is locked behind meta in your opinion?
---
Guildwars2 is slowly going to be other ANNOYING MMORPG
---
Use spoiler tag.
---
Old news.
---
I just want my stupid mount already T\^T I feel like they're gonna endlessly add more at this point
---
Just shamelessly whore out and do HP runs and mastery completions, those people endlessly beg for (and apparently receive) tips :)
---
Tang, really.
---
farm all day non stop?  
---
i mean you get gold by just moving in the open wolrd and some ppl make even more  
---
you can do istan meta once then farm riba, hot metas   
---
you can even farm the new map, i got around 20-25g each meta there
---
The collection is fine but it should have been designed this way for griffon. Griffon was a game changer back then. Skyscale on the other hand brings nothing special really. At least not atm. Perhaps Anet will design new maps with Skyscale on mind - locked things in the air like mastery point in Dragonfall. 
---
Beside time gating I enjoyed collection so far. There's are lot of things to do. I would wish it was for something I was more excited about.
---
&gt; tl/dr: all things being equal-ish (starting with a bank full of materials and currency) it took me most of a week to complete Astralaria, but i just did Exordium in a little over an hour....
---
That is only when you drown in gold ...
---
That...is a very good point.
---
I forgot where the spears are located, so I almost always never pick up embers :&lt;
---
The fall*
---
rifle and flame thrower is a great place to start.
---
Do we have confirmation about that ?
---
New Friend Ships content
---
Guessing this doesnt work with controllers does it?
---
Oh neat I didn’t know that. Hey what are your thoughts on deadeye? The damage is insane but it seems like every time I try to kneel i get bombarded with AOEs :/
---
Oh thank you, I was looking at the ascended armor prices
---
Not really, all I know is that I saw a user making a PSA post about at at it seemed right at least on the maps I've been in with ppl being unable to join once the message popped
---
Just imagine - if the outrage is this big over something that is not a "game changer" - how big would it have been if it was one?
---
Hope this is intentional, its actually really useful.
---
He's still here.
---
In our hearts.
---
And Aurene's stomach.
---
What is content? Doing a seemingly endless scavenger hunt where you spend half the time on your second monitor looking at a map to find where a certain item is until the game tells you that you have played too much today?
---
Did someone else not post that you could actually do things instead of craft the pungent meat? 
---
Jumping puzzles, kill world bosses...I thought I saw another post about this.
---
i found dragon's stand to be very effective
---
Thank you! I thought I was alone with this haha. I know the timegate is kinda annoying - I'm like an impatient toddler myself sometimes when playing GW2 - but to me it makes perfect sense lore-wise. If we could make our dragon baby hatch &amp; grow up within roughly 2-3hours, that would feel kinda off. Instead, we're actually able to observe its growth over the span of a few days and I really enjoy that :D (Although I'm kinda annoyed by the fact that the follow-up collection after having fed it 12/12 times doesn't unlock immediately...) 
---
Still - I really enjoy the collections so far and I already feel a stronger bond with my Skyscale than with any of my other mounts :)
---
It literally says so when you try to enter the training area and hover over the locked button outside of a squad. I dunno how they can make stuff more obvious if people don't read.
---
Oh that's interesting, gotta check it myself. I expected the answer about hitting Kralk's claw. Common misconception in map chat that you need to put brandstorm down to access it.
---
So you think you are the leader of all germans in this subreddit? I really hope your german SC is fake..
---
Not to mention this was year(s) when whole Dark Souls hype was at it's peak and some people realised dying is fine and difficulty feels rewarding.
---
Ofc hot was on works years before the hype but difficulty can be tuned quickly.
---
Agreed.
---
Hey anet nobody has one yet, it’s not too late to switch them!
---
... Um... so TIL that the beetle has a drift button.
---
On the second question: yyyyyyyyyyyup
---
The items are not required. You can simply do the objective instead.
---
honestly i feel like the whole 'the end' sequence wouldve been better out of player control, it had nice pieces but felt super hampered by trying to integrate control into it
---
Jumping puzzles? Dear Joko.... I suck so much at those that I'd almost rather have Kralk back.
---
Open world pve everything works unless you really are doing everything possible to use unhelpful gear and skill.
---
Exactly.
---
Actually, i have full minstrel healbrand and he is very good. In high tier fractals i play with alacrigade, so no chrono or druids.  
---
Trust me, druid is not better, at least for fractals.
---
I still never use jackal, raptor is much more enjoyable
---
Direct copy/paste from Release Notes:
---
"The skyscale Mastery line will now be hidden for players who have not acquired the skyscale so that they will continue to gain Mastery experience toward acquiring Spirit Shards."
---
It now functions exactly as every other Mastery Track in the game.
---
That’s what I was hoping to hear. I’m not to familiar with all the names so I’ll look that up. I’m wondering if condi support is a thing or is that too risky
---
go sleep early and prepare JP Day 7 lol
---
Except in this case it's an instance of actually playing the game and not pressing a fucking button three times before the curtains close again
---
I assume that is the part after "Skyscale Lost". Had to go to bed (reset happens 2 am for me), so I still need some puzzles to finish it. What is after it?  Any timegate?
---
It doesn't show up for my chef :(
---
I'm not saying I want tips, particularly, it's just that I see them talked about but I've only really got them once or twice and wondered if it's a *me* thing or just people overstating it.
---
The other answer is weird.
---
&gt; Is PvP Balanced
---
It's not perfect, but it's not awful either. Sometimes classes will be more powerful than they should, but it's rare and unlikely that a class becomes an instant win button.
---
&gt; Is PvE fun
---
Despite a weird belief going around, GW2 is *primarily* a PvE MMO. The PvP modes are more robust than most MMOs, but the vast, *vast* majority of players spend 99% of their time in PvE. Take from that what you will.
---
&gt; How much time to 500g?
---
This is a kind of bizarre question. Why 500g? What's special about that amount? 500g is a pretty large chunk of money in this game. Not rich, but far from poor.
---
The best gold grinds will get you about 20g an hour. There are things that will get more, but they're generally limited to once per day.
---
So if you set up everything perfectly and did nothing but grins, maybe 20 hours? 
---
&gt; Class
---
Thief or Mesmer both fit this. Both can have a playstyle similar to Rogue. Thief probably moreso, but Mesmer has the melee and the stealth and the evades too.
---
&gt; Trading Post
---
Like all Player run trading in any game ever, people can and will undercut you. It's unlikely that you will be undercut by 10g, but yes. It's a player driven market. People can list for (almost) anything they feel like.
---
&gt; Buying other stuff.
---
"Have to" is a strong word, but yes, there are other things.
---
Between/Before expansions, we get episodic story DLC. Most is quite good. Season 2, 3, and 4 together cost about $30--the price of one expansion, with about the same amount of content, or slightly more, than one expansion.
---
You can buy them with in game gold, but I personally wouldn't rely on that. It would make you focus on gold grinding too much. I suppose you could buy 2 or 3, and if you are frugal, by the time you get to 4, you'll have enough gold for most of it.
---
The business model is a bit weird, though honestly fairly generous. Logging in will get you the latest episode for free, forever. Logging in right now gives Season 4 Episode 6. If you miss it, they're about $2.50 an episode or less in a bundle.
---
Yet I'm still thrilled by the music, every time.
---
Honestly? No.
---
I mean, don't get me wrong, it was certainly enjoyable. But the story and the visuals in particular suffered a lot this season, IMO. There's two distinct problems to it:
---
* GW2's combat is nowadays just too busy. Often times combat moments are supposed to include either story as characters talk to one another, or important visual set pieces. Either way, it comes down to stroboscopes flashing on your screen while your sound goes crazy because well, combat. I like GW2's combat (well, most of it in any case) but it's not suitable for anything important happening concurrent to it.
---
* The story in itself felt... more than a bit aimless? The story doesn't seem to want to acknowledge how much time passes between each step, which is a giant missed opportunity I feel. Everyone at the beginning of this episode was fresh from the end of ep5, while for me that was long done and dealt with. Plus, the entire ep5 was just padding, considering how easily we win at the beginning of this episode.
---
It's weird. They have all the right set pieces in there. They just don't seem to be able to pull them together into something truly great. I find myself being way more swooned by the - at the surface far inferior - story of FF14, simply because they give their story enough time to actually become something instead of running from setpiece to setpiece, all individual, all disconnected.
---
Now if only their icons were actually visible.
---
Hmm.. flying mounted combat using gryffin (interceptor) and skyscale (bomber) that launch off of moving air ships (carriers)! All the ground mounts can be used for raiding other airships, by jumping onto them, cause screw ropes with hooks. Still need more aerial combat stuff tho, and I'm also off genre lol.
---
Yep it seems so, basically when the champs are up and the 20m you have to do them passes all the WP's on the map get removed. You start at ground zero and escort everybody to establish the bases again, then get them to lvl4, do meta.. rinse and repeat
---
True. I'm not really impressed with it when I used them for the mission.
---
Yh should have clarified, I mean "no ADDITIONAL timegate" like for the feeding. The daily reset is here to stay for the entire collection.

I'd def say 3 is the worst so far since you have to wait around for nothing.
---
&gt;!What are these beings who claim to be gods? It's up for speculation, but it seems likely that, similar to dragon's alignment, they are the people who've ascended to particular magical realms as a stabilizing presence for that power. The presence of the elder dragons presumably was redundant and conflicting within Tyria, and may even have led to their madness.!&lt;
---
&gt;!The power of the slain dragons was absorbed and redistributed through Tyria's leylines to their new hosts, the rest of the dragons, including a prismatic elder dragon, and any other recipients. The remaining dragons are not a problem as long as they remain dormant.!&lt;
---
&gt;!The mists have been destroyed and has suffered a surge of magic that has essentially shoved parts of the mists onto Tyria already. It remains to be seen what cleanup will have to be performed in Tyria and in the Mists. If the dragons acted as a force to balance and gatekeep the barriers between magic and the Mists, it's clear that Tyria has been left much more vulnerable to threats.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Your actions led to the birth of a prismatic elder dragon, a particular form of an elder dragon that can presumably better tolerate the unbalanced magical leylines within Tyria. It also seems likely she is like Kralkatorrik's mother was, and can eventually mother her own offspring to eventually restore the magical balance. That's quite some exposé away.!&lt;
---
To be fair tho they are magical elementals, it's not even an animal so dunno what kind of bond I'd have with a bunch of sand xD
---
Spoiler stuff aside, the best moment of Episode 6, hands down

Yes. You need to max out the legendary crafting mastery.
---
Joko was immortal but not unkillable. You could have killed him but he would ressurect again (can someone confirm that?) like Voldemort. His magic has been eaten by Aurene, so Joko can't revive again (surely he don't know how to use WPs xD).
---
There is nothing between Rox and Braham. Rox just want to live with Olmakhan and this means no more adventures with Braham. I would say there is something between Rox and Boticca, *but shh...*
---
Talking Aurene was a... weird experience. She has voice of a little girl. I know she's young, but still — it doesn't fit her.
---
And about Taimi — I liked her in previous two episodes. Sad, angry and taking everything as an adult. And suddenly she has turned into happy girl like nothing happened in "All Or Nothing" (First she's sad about her condition and Blish, and then everything is gone).
---
Yeah it looks like there is a lightsource behind the tree.

You mean where people buy RMT gold for someone else in the hopes they'll be suspended? It was a whole hooha a while back where people were getting actioned without even accepting the gold, but ANet changed the policy to be more along the lines of "as long as you either return to sender, or realise your mistake accepting it and contact support asap you'll be fine" The support knowledge base article has the full details. https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011560933-Policy-Purchasing-Gold-from-Real-Money-Traders-RMT-
---
What about making the events and subsequent rewards more visible? Like in WvW?
---
After feeding you dont get skyscale unlocked ?
---
That was never up for debate. The original question was if Necro can be used in endgame PvE content and I gave an honest answer. Druid is a great support class. I don't believe anyone was questioning that. I just tried to shine some light on support Scourge.
---
Imagine this; he almost lost that bet had Aurene not resurrected.
---
&gt; And Id argue that it doesnt quite make sense to force feed your skyscale to instant juvie years -&gt; see my heavily downvoted reddit comment on that
---
But you can't just add RP elements to an RP game. That's just wrong! /s
---
&gt; No I mean where was it confirmed that Glint was born uncorrupted or even before Kralk became an Elder Dragon?
---
I never said the latter, and in Arah Warden Illyra says that the Forgotten **returned** Glint's free will, meaning she had it once and lost it (in corruption).
---
&gt; I mean we haven't seen a second Pale Tree to pollinate ours, even though that cave was originally mentioned to contain several seeds.
---
Did you miss the seven Blighting Trees in HoT? Or forgot about Malyck's tree?
---
Or how about the fact that the Great Tree in TD is slowly becoming corrupted into a Blighting Tree (as per the meta descriptions)?
---
Pale Trees are just purified Blighting Trees, which in turn are just corrupted giant trees (which I believe are Stonewood Trees, the largest trees in the Maguuma).
---
&gt; In principle I agree, but I believe "scion" to be a subcategory of minion (with the aforementioned exception of offspring born before the parent became an ED) simply because the corruption seems to seep into everything whether the dragon wants it to or not.
---
Per Arah's dialogue and Glint originally having free will at one point before losing it and becomign Glaust, that's untrue.
---
&gt; I'm struggling to understand your definition of "biological reproduction". Read the article on asexual reproduction, bacteria cannot do anything but clone themselves.
---
The typical ways a bird, reptile, amphibian, mammal, fish, or arthropod may reproduce.
---
Creating something out of **external, foreign materials** - such as twisted earth or random, unrelated plants, or from various corpses - is not any this.
---
And that's what ultimately separates dragon scion from dragon champion. Glint is stated to be Kralkatorrik's biological daughter, while The Shatterer is just a hand-crafted minion. One is a scion, the other a mere champion.
---
&gt; Aurene also matured by absorbing magic to grow in size and power.
---
Key word being matured. Destroyers who grew in size did not mature. They have one state of age, Aurene had four (egg, infant, adolescent, adult).
---
&gt; Compare the Destroyer Queen to a RL insect hive: the queen produces princesses and drones which are themselves capable of mating but also workers, soldiers and even freak specialists as seen in honeypot ants. Those are not always completely sterile but almost never reproduce and can have large differences in physiology.
---
The Destroyer Queen does none of that. She just creates destroyers of all shapes and sizes. You could compare them all to soldier drones, but there'd be no workers, no princesses, no mating drones. Just soldiers.
---
And the Destroyer Queen itself doesn't mate, it twists rock and lava into these drones.
---
&gt; No, you need self-replication (intermediate steps optional) for a species. 
---
Which is why dragon minions are not such. They could self-replicate, but they have no limitation of such. That's merely a choice instilled by the Elder Dragon.
---
&gt; Asura golemancers don't count but an autonomous factory staffed only by golem models it can produce itself would, that's basically a mechanical bee/ant/termite hive.
---
I'm pretty sure almost everyone would disagree with you that self-replicating robots are not a species. They lack biological systems and are doing this self-replication by utilizing foreign materials unlike biological species.
---
There is a secret shortcut for extremly unpatient people whining about the time-gated stuff.

---
I haven't even started the first collection yet. It's gonna take me a while to unlock this mount...
---
I'm as well part of that silent sector who's loving this collection. I feel really bad for those who don't craft their daily charged quartz crystal, but besides that, breeding your mount is really cool, and considering we don't *need* the skyscale, I don't even mind a few days of wait. We feed it, we grow it and then we mount it.
---
PD: If you don't have it, get [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Krait_Obelisk_Shard_(item)) this summer. It let's you craft this charged quartz crystal within your home instance, which is super convenient, and in your daily routine, you just pay a visit to your home (with quartz in your inventory), gather whatever you have there and make the crystal.
---
That's very good of you :). If I was a mesmer I would have done the same. Actually someone did come by while I was watching, and put in a portal (maybe it was you!). It did mean less bunny-hopping-chaos for a short time though...
---
Aren't mounts disabled for JPs, no?
---
Well its waiting. Id rather wait than go for another run in the spirits of the egg hunts :D
---
Female Bandit: LEAVE ME BE!!!
---
Me: Bitch, you attacked me first!
---
I guess my problem is its like getting a new toy at christmas. You don't have much because your parents have 3 kids so gifts come infrequently, and thats fine you love your parents and cherish them. But this time they told you before christmas "you're getting a new toy, this is what you're getting as we know you love this line of toys." and then on christmas you open your present expecting to play with this new toy you're so excited for and then your dad stops you. He tells you "we have a rule for this present. You have to wait a week before you can let your imagination run wild."
---
(yeah i know its a terrible analogy)
---
Maybe I'm on my own here, I consider MMOs my hobby and true passion and by extent I've spent a tonne of time on them. So I probably just have a very different perspective on the game as a whole from most.
---
To compare to a similar but not situation. Beetle was obtainable in a day or two, and it alone reignited my passion for gw2 and got me playing for a month or so again, as opposed to the 2 or so days i've spent on the other episode releases. Its just like having a new bucket in the sandbox I guess.
---
against the wind, judging from the picture
---
Everything about that comic is fucking perfect.
---
... Yeah, 80 gold across 5 days or so. So like 4-5 hours of T4s, right?
---
Some people would rather pay up, some people would rather run the JPs (or get ported) and do a few world bosses.
---
It looks like that each stage of he collection is on a different map.  You can use the new food while on the map to skip its collection requirement.
---
I never visit Hoelbrak exactly because of this
---
Trahearne died in mordremoth's lair and he was a student of Orr. There are many possibilities to separate it from necro/reaper theme.
---
Anyone who joined recently due to the actually-existent advertising has never played Season 3, so they have zero experience with shrines.
---
In hindsight, it's kind of a shame that they didn't have at least 1-2 shrines in Crystal Oasis or introduce a couple in Central Tyria maps as Current Events content.
---
^This nothing fun about silly time gates tied to "cute" animations to try to convince you its somehow worth it. The Salt Scale better be godly with all masteries
---
The vocal minority, as always, exaggerated about the time gate, calling it unnecessary, bad, greedy.  
---
It is no different than getting a skin from a dungeon, grinding what ever currency to buy something prestigious, no matter what you try to do you are time gated. What's next?! do we start complaining about the currency cap from raids? or about food costing gold? it really is ridiculous.The Skyscale collection is already  player friendly by the fact that they gave you the option to buy the time gated materials. 
---
All I see is mostly veterans, complaining that they can't have the shiny (I am one of them without the complaining) because they are the kind of player who will not sleep first day until they got the mount that, surprise, are not required to have to enjoy the game, specially since there are plenty of Skyscales on the map for you to hop on.  
---
I think as GW2 players we tend to forget how good we have it.
---
No, I fell off the tree five days ago. Yesterday, I fell off the turnip cart.
---
there are so many high grounds u need to reach for both story and achievement, which can be really hard to reach with skyscale or springer
---
Hm for me tagging her like you said (ctrl left click) doesnt work, she disappears
---
Or you know if you have gold you can just spam open Trick or treat bags or wintersday boxes. Youll get em eventually
---
Not a programmer but I feel like a change like this would require a patch to implement properly, not a hotfix.
---
The raptor is so shit.
---
Not all of them, and some others can easily be done using mounts just outside the blocked zone and then gliding (if possible) or simply moving in an appropriate direction in the air.
---
luxons only.
---
Nope, you get the next collection after the following reset
---
For about 5 years I always thought I heard “more violence, less violence” which I always thought was a confusing and thought provoking question of deep intent, little did I know I’m just a fucking idiot

---
Could we get some screanshots of those achievements for those who doesnt ave it unlocked yet ? For Lost , Rexflexes and Stelth please ?
---
i want to know where my unlock for beetle/warclaw/skyscale awakened skins is.
---
Poor squidward

Which do you think has better survivability between the weaver build and tempest build?

Ive had it. Its great
---
Where's this scout at? Base or one of the camps?
---
Oh absolutely. Just something other than running the same route for the 4th time :D but youre right the waiting is annoying
---
Now I know why I kept dying when using melee on the menders. XD. I was always confused because they never showed the buff, but I guess since they're always near the weak spot since people ignore them, my attacks were cleaving it along with the mender.
---
telescope icon in every camp
---
I can't help with the dye colors, but just to mention there's also a backpack reward for doing the Shatterer world-boss a bunch of times (some of the specific achievements needed are, unfortunately, tricky and require a focused group). The backpack also has purple colored crystal spikes -- could work with your look. Although, these crystals have a 2-tone black/purple, I don't know if it's possible to exactly match with \*any\* dye on the outfit.

This is a rule of the forums, there's a 30 day window where we should be careful for those who haven't played through yet... On my web-browser it's quite literally visible as I'm type this.
---
given the rarity of getting charged quartz out of those you might just be better off to buy the Growth Lamp/Skyscale food of the TP directly, gold wise.
---
Unfortunately it seems like devs have been messing with the API and something was broken in the process, for the past week all websites that utilize the API for trait/skill/items/class icons have been failing. What build were you looking for? Maybe we can give you a hand :D.
---
"Amazing view" yellow sky with balloonships.
---
I'm in na and I never tip meta commanders but always tip portal mesmers and hp trains.
---
Feels like portal mesmers and hp trains are going out of their way for me while meta commanders get their loot anyway.
---
&gt;telescope icon in every camp
---
lol it doesn't activate the events it just tells you what events are active on this region
---
Greedy and hate JPs? No skyscale for you mister!
---
For bridge, it actually activates. It starts the moment you click if not already going on.
---
Recently came back after 4+ years. I bought both expansions, I’ve already decided to skip the majority of heart of thorns. 
---
Im still working through the PoF story, but when I’m done with that should I go through all the living world episodes or skip to the current season?
---
I’m still trying to figure out gw2 endgame and I’m wondering if I’m “wasting” time by not going to the most current content for gear/crafting/raids etc.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Thanks for your detailed explanation! But i checked some guides too which recommend either full berserkers or a mix of berserkers and diviners gear :x The gear i should aim for is kinda confusing or is it a personal decision? :)
---
\*gets mail, from Canach\*

Commander, there is something important I need to discuss with you and everyone else. Come to these coordinates.

IF not Asuran

"I can't believe..."

Story starts: Go to... Caudecus's Manor?
---
Now thats an unexpected Katya reference
---
Oh, so that really was a reference!
---
If I had finished the first collection 20 minutes before reset and not after I would have been way less annoyed.
---
I'm not gonna take Joko's word on anything. The Elder Dragons last awoke before humanity showed up, and Joko is clearly a human.
---
arah first pull . 20 simple spider. aoe them all then portal just outside the dungeon and enter again. no need to search for mobs, no need to hit mobs before others. you are in a dungeon .
---
A player was porting elements of the collection in the Desert Highlands tonight; they were very patient with me and gave me some extra attention so I tipped them handsomely.
---
Most of the stuff has been fairly easy so far, though if players are porting JPs when I get to that part I'm going to tip like crazy.  It'll be cheaper than the treats!
---
If memory serves there was a hot second after PoF dropped where a lot of the content that's since been made no-mount-zones was still open to them.
---
It's true.  I bought my way through Mawdrey and do *not* regret it.
---
&gt; Maybe they could add it in as a 'celebration' thing following a successful meta, while the ley-bosses are going on? 
---
That would be absolute hell for those of us who want to go for top-times, having to wait for the meta to succeed. This already was very annoying with the event race blocking the time trial one on the halloween map, it would be even more painful if you had to complete a whole meta before you'd be able to continue doing runs
---
Other than what others say, try to always do daily HoT metas, those will give you ton of materials useful for crafting Astralaria. Here’s one way to do it: park 1 character on Matriarch platform in VB, she spawns every two hours at XX:10 min, so you log in 3-4 minutes earlier, there should be few more people waiting for her, kill her, then quickly hop onto different character because at XX:30 starts TD meta event with chak gerent. Then after it ends at around XX:45, go to AB and wait for Tarir to start, if your map is good, event will be done in like 5 minutes, thus taking you only 1 hour to do 3 big HoT metas, which generate 3 amalgamated gemstones (you need 250 for Astralaria I believe), ton of materials/currencies needed to purchase legendary gifts and a lot of experience you need to max out HoT masteries. Good luck!

I wasn’t going to answer that question unless you asked it :).  Ideally you want as much damage as you can get, which means full Berserker gear.  But you also want the Alacrity you apply to your group to have 100% uptime.  If you and your group are experienced and well-coordinated you may be able to achieve that 100% uptime with full Berserker gear.  But if Alacrity falls off periodically during combat then you may need to mix some Diviner’s gear in to get enough Concentration to keep Alacrity up 100%.  So it’s just a function of whether you can keep Alacrity up 100% or not and if not then how much Diviner gear do you need to mix in.  And you have to figure that part out on your own, will take some experimentation.
---
Ideally you collect a full set of Ascended Berserker armor, trinkets and weapons, and a second full set of Asc Diviner’s gear.  Mix and match them as needed, then send the remainder over to your Guardian.  Quickbrand is similar in that can theoretically keep Quickness up on its group 100% with just Berserker gear, if the group is well-coordinated.  But mixing in some Diviner’s makes it easier, especially for uncoordinated PUG groups.  But you can share the same gear set between these two toons very effectively.
---

If you get POF (which you should, you get mounts) and go holosmith it is basically meta in fractals and raids using rifle

They have plans, but they haven't thought it out. Certainly no "mother of Elder Dragons" since they said they don't know the origins of the Elder Dragons.
---
They also said they often write things they think is cool, and build on them later on. From all they said, it seems this "mother" bit is one of those.
---
so is there another time gated collection after?
---
Have you tried not being retarded for once?

If people find a certain way of playing most optimal that ruins the whole thing, it's definitely a design problem. You can't expect people to play in a certain way just because you want them to.

ppl rush through the content, the achiev wasnt meant to be done in 2hrs

you can tag 4-5 bridges each meta. but no ppl want their shinnies now
---
I dont have it unlocked wich means that I cant see it myself. For me to add it on wiki I need to know wich icons are where on what places. For that  I need to see it in game. API code shows items and not icons so its a bit more complicated then you think. So I can leave it for tomorrow when I will be able to see it myself or ask politely here on reddit. Maybe someone here will have time to make me those screanshots. So please tell me what about this is retarded ? Enlighten me please... I cant wait to hear another one of your insults.
---
Then it's a flawed design, at least for the achievement....

The game never tell you what to do, and if you do not want to complete maps or do hearts or even story you do not have to do that. There is no order when leveling you do not miss anything by choosing the way you want to do it. There are so many ways to get xp in this game that you can level up just by gathering nodes if that is what you like. How ever that would take a very long time but still it is possible.
---
So if you want to jump to zones lower level then you do so you will be scaled downed and you get your xp and loot of your real level. 
---
How ever events and story will be the bigger xp gain. Dungeons also give you a good chunk of xp and doing the story mode of the dungeons also give you chunks of extra story. Worldbosses and world event or special events give you a good amount of xp. The invasion event that turns up every hour on some of the maps give you more then a level for 10 min works. 
---
Story also give you gear enough to get to lvl 80 and buffs and other stuff good to have. But again it is not a must but good to do.
---
Something you need to be aware of is that if you only level up in the very low level areas you will never really learn how to deal with mobs. Mobs in the core game are very easy to kill regardless even in the higher levels so if you decide to get the expansion and move in to that after only playing in low level areas will give you a total shock so try and move in higher areas as well just to learn how to play agains mobs.
---
can i give you one for free?
---
I guess if you get stressed out like that. I have no issues doing these, so for me it's just a drawback with no positives.
---
Ok. That would burn me out
---
more than 2 gold per hour, dont underestimate the power of bot and scripts
---
Dunno, i  I got tingles when i heard the pact base music at the first vista in dragonfall. When we  heard that music when entering the silverwastes for the very first time it was awesome.
---
I mean theoretically it can take the shape of a giant d\*ck and we ride it, it's magical sand that the Djinns shaped into jackals and tamed with the runes. Left alone it's just wild magic and sand soup still trying to kill everything.
---
You see those yellow mobs like goats and rams? yeah those are calling you nasty names and therefore must die! You go kill them real good!  
---
Mobs that haven't been killed in a while gives bonus exp, so usually yellow mobs in low populated areas gives lots of exp, sometimes x3-4 the exp as normal.
---
Uff no offense but pls don't edit the wiki with that english
---
This is an epic shot.
---
As short as this episode was, I really liked it artistically.
---
The opening sequence with Aurene, this shot right here, and the closing scene which had a number of memorable shots (I had my finger on the printscreen button the whole time).
---
I have no clue to be honest . One person says one thing and the other something diferent. Im able to see the achievements even when its not unlocked on my account, but not the items in the achievement. But even then it shouldnt mater. I only need a screanshot where I could see all the icons in order they are suppose to be.
---
&gt; nothing fun about silly time gates tied to "cute" animations to try to convince you its somehow worth it.
---
You should go stream some Tetris or Pong.
---
if you are done feeding, you can do all that shit https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bqo422/troublesome_skyscales_collection_thread/
---
and after that next reset is a other collection
---
Eh, wouldn't really say I was stressed out. Though it seems several folks were. But there is an underlying pressure to get "everything for the day" done.
---
My point being that if they're to do timegates, then every day should be a small amount, and step 1 isn't. This makes step 3 a well-designed timegate compared to step 1.
---
Now I feel like and idiot for doing a 24hr le mans around the map
---
Power Quickbrand is really wonderful for a hybrid DPS/Support build. I play that build very often in fractals on my main and enjoy it incredibly. But Healbrand is also a really nice option if you use the build on Snowcrows. Their healing is actually more consistent than Druid if I understand correctly? Since Druid needs to be in Astral Phase (if that's what the ability is called? Never played druid so definitely speaking from my armchair) to do it's best work.
---
I have been playing for a long time, but I still don't have any really good gear. What would be the best approach for me if I wanted to get ascended gear?

It's not an issue anymore, but the hassle of an invisible bag isn't worth it either if it's just to haul 25 crafting mats around for like 5-10 minutes per day.

yeah normally I play with friends. When I'm alone I dont wear my support gear of course unless i'm fighting a boss or something. I've never done a condi build before, and it seems like it would be nice with the FB's aoe's and constant burning. I can burst down guys super fast with my deadeye but everytime there is 3 or more things coming at me I'm kinda up a creek. So I just want to try something different. I was thinking with condi though it's good damage, but over time, so that might be an issue. I just buy a cheap exotic set and give it a shot.
---
I think we got a couple of hints. They were just not the "In your face" kind of hints. I mean... We can be 100% sure that we interact with Aurene again. Otherwise the transformation of Caithe would make no sense at all. We also have Kralkatorriks final word "mother", that screams for some additional information.
---
There is a new landmass that originated from the mists. Including everything associated with it. (Spirits for example) We killed an elder Dragon more or less in the middle of the sea. The final cutscene also shows Aurene flying off over the Ocean. I think we can be save to say that she went either east or south. Keeping in mind that we already have playable content in the east (Elona), my guess would be she went south. Either to Cantha or somewhere else beyond the unending ocean. Why do I think that? The final cutscene shows the characters standing on an green plateau. And the Melandru part of that map is in the south/east.
---
And last but not least, the elephant in the room. Bubbles... We know that he is active because of the Quaggan, Lagos and Krait. What we don't know is, did he already awaken? If not, could Kralkatorriks death pretty much in the middle of the unending sea do exactly that? Or do we just assume that Aurene absorbed 100% of all magic around that area? This would be a first in GW2 history. Balthazar was not able to absorb all magic from the Bloodstone and previous elder dragon deaths also split the magic between all of the other dragons. And there are Ley-Lines all over the place where Kalk died. I think it would be stupid to say "Aurene got all of it!" but then again... She is our new Deus-Ex machina since Taimi is not feeling like pulling new inventions out of her sleeves all the time.
---
So no, I don't agree that we have nothing to work with based on what Arena Net showed us. I think they want to keep the marketing rolling like for this episode and we will get a lot information within the next couple of months.
---
Why? I know what you'll do. You don't want your math to be scrutinised.
---
80 Gold versus human interaction? 
---
Guess I'd better open the bank.
---
The quality of some of the clues in leaves a lot to be desired. The skyscale scales were very good and challenged map knowledge, while the egg hunt was more than tedious: "there are 2 eggs in Mosswood".
---
Without the guide I would have found the eggs very frustrating rather than tedious.
---
I never said anything that was not true, despite your accusations. It is true that you accused me of being a liar, not that I am one. You did indeed fail to provide any evidence of the claims you made.
---
Carrion and Rabid are good, you get a bit of survivability with your condi. And Guardian has lots of AoE so you just have to practice positioning yourself such that your AoE can hit everything
---
I feel like I'm raising a skyscale. I don't care what anyone says doing everything in a day is not raising something "cough" rollerbeetle "cough"
---
Ahhh grow lamps and sigils of nullification
---
Yeah that's how I found it too. I actually really enjoyed that achievement because I got to run around and explore lol. You should return to it sometime and just plop your character down, it's really peaceful there
---
Thank you. At least 2 more icons we can delete from the unused list :3
---
Nice I'll go with that. I have quite a bit of money, but I just want to decide on something before I put all the time and effort into ascended gear. Hey while you're here, I remember the other thing I wanted to ask. Does power or crit effect conditional damage or is it just it's own thing?
---
Ah, yes. The ~~gating~~ *passing* of time.
---
It's kind of on the world map.
---
ah, that's a point i hadn't considered.
---
Well, the list has been not up-to-date for at least a year and a half now and it has been reported on reddit with a response from Gaile Gray back in the day as well as by a customer service ticket... Still no update since then.
---
To be aggressive, be a target, create pressure and pushing power, making space for your high damage ranged to come forward. Stand off of 10v10 ranged looks very different with one agro war that can stay alive in it.
---
I like the elementalist but I'm afraid Iim bad at it
---
I don't like the guardian but many people recommend it.
---
The ranger is the safest but I get bored at it
---
I was excited when I first starting doing the meta and saw all the rare gear. Then I went to sell the extra extos I got...
---
Yes the only thing that made it look so annoying where a combination of a couple of things.
---
First, and probably the biggest of the following things, we do not know if the masteries will remove the downglide or give the clinging to cliffs a point. Therefore the big time investments feels unjustified, because the skyscale starts off underwhelming.
---
Secondly, today marks the day where some players reached the Troublesome Skyscale collection. Meaning, a lot of players on this subreddit are rushing it to no end. Not to mention that we had several "Troublesome Skyscale" threads popping up meaning those were the people complaining in the first place.  Justified or not justified. I feel like we had some anchor effect going on with the mass of rushers complaining.
---
And last but not least, we had todo the same Scavenger Hunt three times right after we experienced the overbalance and underwelming no-masteries Skyscale from my first point. That made it hurt even more. Everything that came afterward couldn't be seen anything but negative because at this point we were already butthurt. Even the cute little Skyscale hatchling didn't get anything more than some ridicule threads about the feeding process until now from non-rushers.
---
Well we are quite biased here. In all honesty though, just try the F2P base game and that should be enough to get a feel of the game and know whether you want to keep at it and get the expansions or not.
---
Yeah, so if you have any ascended or legendary equipment, check to see if they have infusion slots. When you complete a level in fractals you’ll get agony infusions (looks like a green blob) in your inventory. You can add these to agony infusion slots. Be careful, because one you add agony infusion, you’ll replace whatever agony was there. So if you have something that’s +9 agony and try to add a +1, you’ll remove the  +9 and that would sucks. 
---
But if you don’t have ascended or legendary armor, best to start with heavy or middle class so that you don’t get totally shredded. 
---
More [info here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Agony_Resistance) about agony resistance.
---
I wonder if they would do a main set. But also once you've earnt the trinkets you'll have a collection item you can craft. Similar to caladbolg.  
---
Maybe they can make Mist Trinkets upgradable similar to how armor can be in pvp and wvw.  
---
Be an interesting idea if they did a fractal one, pvp one, wvw one.
---
This is how fake news are created. already 15 upvotes and nobody checked if it's real thing
---
Yes please. The more options, the better.
---
This whole thing reminds me about how they sometimes go overboard when trying to craft a story about acquiring something via collections. Take the last Legendary with collections (Chuka and Champawat). I think I counted up 14 collections there, and after that they decided doing those collections were unsustainable...which they certainly are if you're going overboard like that.
---
The Rollerbeetle had 3 collections. I've lost count of how many the skyscale has now.
---
Same shit as with literally every precursor collection - Do all the jumping puzzles in the game.. 
---
:/
---
What doesn’t make sense with that answer is the Magic he consumed that drove him crazy didn’t happen until well after he takes out Glint judging by the facets we face. I thought he killed glint because it was something he felt compelled to do to bring about Aurenes ascension.
---
Use the home instance hero challenge to charge the quartz.  The Krait one you can unlock from the laurel merchant. No mobs to distract you.
---
Crit chance only affects power damage, not condi damage. So if you're going condi don't bother with prec and fer.
---
The stats that affect condis are condition damage and expertise, which affects duration. But expertise is a relatively rare stat. Wiki has all the details.
---
Thank you!!
---
I've probably done this meta one hundred time *after* having the achievement unlocked
---
I enjoy these.
---
We've known since the update dropped that there are 5 main achievements to unlock the Skyscale. (This is the fourth one) We won't know exactly what the last one requuires until tomorrow.
---
Here is stuff i noticed in my time with the map(finished the full Blossoming set on Saturday)
---
The first three escort events take very slightly different amounts of time with the one to the south(Melandru) usually being the fastest. You can then try speeding to the other events with beetle. These first escorts always grants 3 keys and spawn 3 chests.
---
When doing the Shadow Elemental Boss as part of the boss rush, make absolutely sure to clear the trash in his arena. They can heal him and make you waste significant amounts of time.
---
During the final part, make sure to restock on Dragonblood spears regularly. This allows you to spend some not only for the Boss immunity but to also use them for Menders to burn them quickly. Using Griffon from the Shrines is usually just as fast a way to get to the weakpoints as the leyline from a destroyed one and you can look out for Pylons on the way.
---
Speaking of the leyline, it's not a real leyline. It can carry you up into the air even when you are not gliding, so it's easier to just jump into it and wait for it to start carrying you and to then start gliding to get to the peak.
---
The Slayer and Daily Achievements don't count all enemies, but instead only the enemies unique to the zone. Killing Branded does not advance them.
---
Not unique to Dragonfall, but a small note for Hydra and Branded Hydra bosses. They have an ability that makes either a Fireball or a Branded Crystal fall from the sky, potentially oneshotting you. This ability has both a circle spawning underneath you and a distinct soundfile to telegraph them. Both of these are completely useless because they happen way too late for you to dodge once you see/hear them. The real telegrap to look out for is the Hydra raising its head and looking towards the sky.
---
The PoI at the top of the Severed Wing is fake. It does not count towards map completion.
---
Scaling is wonky in a few places. The 12 escort/protect before meta are precisely hard enough to not be comfortably solo'ed while becoming trvial with 2 people. The destroy turrets with embers event is fastest done solo.
---
Do the "Cull Enemies" events on sight. Never do escort the pilot events.
---
you're already playing the game and you're not sure if you like it..
---
so *no*, the game is obviously not worth buying for you.
---
Just like Istan.
---
After half a year.
---
After the economy is ruined.
---
What's the issue with the spiders? I did it when it was new and it was fun.
---
When that announcement sounds across the auric basin, and war horns Bellow... ~chills~
---
The meta definitely wasn't done when I managed to find that cave, so that has been fixed.
---
Biased answer: Absolutely worth it!
---
But, if not to be biased and to look at stats: 
---
1. ANet started a US-nation-wide campaign to market the game and to attract new faces, as their previous policy wasn't the most polished one.
---
2. The community is very friendly and supportive, thus enableing ANet to keep the game alive.
---
3. With the recent cut-offs (Firstly must say that beautiful minds both in story and developing, left the game, and we WILL MISS THEM... But many more talented ones stated behind to raise GW2 to it's potential), seems like the devs are focused on GW2 even more and it was seen and felt in the last release, as the latest LW episode War Eternal was just awesome, both in content and tieing old narative lines with a satisfying touch.
---
4. LWS5 is just around the corner, maybe will be released in late August or early September, with an expected minimum 6 episodes (based on past experience), with 4 Ep/year, you are looking at 1.5-2 years just for this LW season alone. 
---
5. Combat experience: It is better than any popular MMO currently on the market. Better than even in the videos you can look about GW2. It feels good!
---
6. Premium market is cosmetic and some QoL upgrades. As of 20th May 2019, there is no BtW in this game. 
---
And many more strong subjective points for this game, that I am sure others will add.
---
Well. You saying it like if you don't get something from first time. Then you never understand. For example my fav mmo of all time is FFXIV and I only understand how cool it is from third attempt of playing. Cause you just need right mindset for everything and understand why and how you do stuff. And dat mean I just need more time. But if someone help me understand how game and "fun" in this game work dat will much faster.
---
Btw I don't believe someone can fall in love to everything from first try.
---
&gt; I never said the latter, and in Arah Warden Illyra says that the Forgotten returned Glint's free will, meaning she had it once and lost it (in corruption).
---
That's pretty huge if true, and they *do* repeat it in an objective marker as well. However I will note the dialogue itself is from a sylvari and at least one other statement was later retconned: in her opening dialogue she believes the spell **must** be cast in Arah which definitely is not true for the concept in general based on the failed attempt at converting Kralk.
---
&gt; Did you miss the seven Blighting Trees in HoT? Or forgot about Malyck's tree?
---
Emphasis on the "pollination" part. Maybe she was just hiding the truth but we haven't seen any of those other trees interact in any way to suggest *our* Pale Tree is sexually reproducing with any of them. This of course is consistent with other dragon minion production but the same can be said for Glint's "scions".
---
&gt; Creating something out of external, foreign materials - such as twisted earth or random, unrelated plants, or from various corpses - is not any this.
---
So, uh, what physical matter is the offspring made of? For a start water is an inorganic chemical which all higher lifeforms consume copious amounts of in some form or another.
---
&gt; The Destroyer Queen does none of that. She just creates destroyers of all shapes and sizes. You could compare them all to soldier drones, but there'd be no workers, no princesses, no mating drones. Just soldiers.
---
I completely agree the Destroyer Queen as shown does not meet all requirements. My point was that non-reproductive offspring (harpies and trolls) do not invalidate the concept so **if** the spawned crabs could self-upgrade into new queens they would form a (non-biological) species.
---
&gt; And the Destroyer Queen itself doesn't mate, it twists rock and lava into these drones.
---
We "twist" water, burnt air and dirt into redditors via slave labour of plants. The first single-parent babies aren't too far off either.
---
&gt; I'm pretty sure almost everyone would disagree with you that self-replicating robots are not a species. They lack biological systems and are doing this self-replication by utilizing foreign materials unlike biological species.
---
The robots fail on the "biological" part not the "species". Since Tyria has no published laws of chemistry we cannot draw that distinction. Pretty much all life there consumes and excretes magic by happenstance and several which we would otherwise call "biological life/species" subsist primarily if not entirely on magic. Would you call the Chak a "species", biological or otherwise?
---
I landed on the airship by accident the first time i used the tubes.  
---
Flying meteorically through the sky, all of a sudden, airship.  
---
It took me quite by surprise.
---
The Heart icons are essentially the quests for GW2. When you are behind in levels for the main quest chain you want to be bouncing between those and the world events(all the orange circles and markers on the map.) that pop up around the zone you are in. 
---
A big part of the game revolves around doing these world events at end game, on the achievement/PvE side of things at least. They are big ass chains and some can take upwards of 30 minutes to an hour and require hundreds of people so you'll want to get the hang of them. 
---
Leveling is a bit different than other MMOs but once you get to max level it'll have the same ole dungeons, raids, PvP, and grindable content like other MMOs if you are into that.
---
That actually is more of an argument for beards rather than against them :P
---
100% agree, the beards look pretty bad but I would love to have some more customization options in general, and it's not like that wouldn't make them any money. I'm sure they earn a shitton through appearance changes if they do.
---
Maybe arachnophobia? I used to play with someone and we thought hmm base story, what won't have spiders in it? I know lets take on Zhaitan's Navy! Couple hours and many many profanities later I joined and soloed the mission for her as she simply could not cope with a few dozen spider models.
---
Ahh, I didn't realise destroy turrets scaled too. I'm gonna try to solo it myself in that case, it usually can take a while to complete.
---
It can be frustrating the first time you go into the spider room, if you're not prepared for the immobilizes and poison. It's mostly why people rage xD
---
A bit (kinda very) expensive, but what about Dawn for the wep?
---
Hahahahaha, yes! This moment was doubly good when you remember that just a couple story chapters ago, Taimi revealed her disease is getting worse and the pain is sometimes unbearable.
---
But right now? Right now, Taimi don't give a damn. Right now Taimi has firepower overwhelming. Right now she is going to blow as many Branded to bits as possible, *and she is going to have the time of her life doing it.*
---
ITT: a whole lot of ANet apologetics and [masochists](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/masochist).
---
But you still need to pay a bit if you want to unlock the recipe for cook.
---
Oh, look at the 1%ers of the game saying this is fine...
---
The story payoff is worth it in the end, IMO, and finishing it does unlock a path to a fairly easy to obtain ascended weapon.
---
On the flip side, I agree with you on a lot of your complaints, especially the navigation issues.
---
Tell this person to stay away from season 4 episode 4.
---
I was looking at that actually, but I also don’t have the gold for that. I figured the blade of this weapon isn’t yellow, but the shape was right and the fact that the fire on it being blue was a bonus detail
---
I do so usually during the  4th weakpoint and at the beginning. At this point I feel like I can need to spam it  a little more.
---
There aren’t any major rewards for doing story that will matter in raids. If you complete the HoT story you can get a cheap ascended weapon and you’ll need some mastery unlocks for some raids (like key gliding in wing 3). Season 3 (and 4 to a lesser extent) have options for ascended trinkets and are the recommended way of getting them but again you would just need to get to the zone not do the story. If you’re trying to rush into raids read that hearing guide, look up a build and rotation on snowcrows and practice it. Once you’re geared and ready look into a training discord or the guides linked above for raids like tevatron’s.
---
i’ll take it with a grain if salt unless your a grandmother too
---
Haha yea I would but after a few spider related incidents she quit :(
---
I was in the exact same situation as you. It's not possible to just turn off the notification without playing either the first instance of HoT or PoF to unlock masteries, which is incredibly annoying. What I did was I played through the first HoT instance in a party with my friends, and tried to pay as little attention as possible to what was happening while my friends did as much as possible for me. To make the notification go away you could do something like this with either HoT or PoF, but you'll get some spoilers either way. I chose HoT because it would only have spoilers for LS2 (as opposed to PoF having spoilers for HoT and LS3 as well), and because I already knew a bit more about the general plot of HoT, but you could choose either depending on what works for you (plus if you do PoF you'll get a raptor so that's nice). If you need people to play through it with you and you're on EU, let me know and I'll gladly help out.
---
Yes, you have to get to the last (4th) room (water) for skyscale.  Spiders are in 3rd room.   (You also need 1st room - ice - for skyscale, but that's "relatively" easy.)  You need the number of runestones from the previous room to open the room # of the next room.  Thus, last room needs 4 runestones from 3rd spider room and you can only carry one at a time, requiring 4 trips to spiders.  It can be a pain for squishy classes.
---
Exactly this, I have bad eyes and even with my glasses I just can't see them a lot of the time.
---
Sounds good!
---
Thanks for all the help! Appreciate it everyone.
---
Taimi as jimmy neutron, Thackeray as Son Goku. What's next? The norn male Pc being Mcree?
---
The story doesn't grip me at all sadly. The bits with the dragons are good, but the actual characters are just uninteresting. But it is worth it for the ascended stuff? Can't I get that through PoF?
---
Since last patch, it dawned on me how much I genuinely love Taimi. She's been there the whole time since I started playing this game at the end of LW S1, she's kind of the Commander's best friend by now
---
&gt;this game for 6 years on market 
---
MMO don't even remotely become worth playing until about five or six years in.
---
She needs help.
---
There is a Jackal Portal behind the Wall that takes you straight to the Hydra.
---
Spiders are squishy and have little variety in their skills.  I've been there with vary glassy glassy cannons and they do not do that much damage.
---
Maybe that person has very unprepared. Like wearing level 60 fine/masterwork gear or something. That doesn't matter much in core maps, but it'll get you killed easily in level 80 maps.
---
It's actually a 30 second cooldown, and you can use it in midair and underwater.
---
Or you can use the sand portal after destroying the wall with beetle.
---
Indeed combat is a debateable topic and there are quite a few types that different companies implement it in their own way. What I meant was that, it feels alive and it suits this game particularily well. :)
---
As XPacs introduce Elite Specs for each proffesion/class (core/ HoT &amp; PoF elites), you have kind of 27 play-styles and even more if you adjust some tweeks. Some are more unique than others.
---
Nobody really will be answer this for you because we all have our own preferences and what we like or what we don't. You can try the game with a free account but if you want the full experience then you have to buy it.
---
We know that the game will get another Living world Season, season 5, which can run 12 to 18 months if it will also have 6 episodes as season 4 had. And even then, I don't think that GW2 is at its "end of live" just yet. GW2 earns ArenaNet money and there is probably enough stuff they can work on for a few additional years.
---
I played the game for 5k hours and had a lot of fun. GW2 is not about what you should do but rather what you want to do. You want to explore the maps, then do that. Want to craft, then craft. The game only gives you the options, what you do is your own choice.
---
How tf does this meta work all I get is people getting pissed that the noobs dont already know what to do and lanes are burning at different rates but sometimes it just kinda works out
---
im using it with the crystals dyed valor on my scion dagger/frostfang soulbeast
---
gotta improvise
---
Thats only parts of it. We had to switch maps because the ring wouldnt turn blue anymore, even after that crystal was destroyed.
---
&gt; Is Heart of Thorns even worth doing?
---
Hell, yes. Absolutely worth it.
---
Oh! The old skyscale teaching the younger one could be part of the collection! That would be so awesome!
---
GET ON THE DAMN SKYSCALE, SHINJI
---
I love the mist shard armor on medium armor classes. I think medium armor won fashion wars for this set. Not a huge fan of the blossoming one though.
---
Nice! I like it. If you didn't came out with this post and this was the actual game, it would be absolutely devastating if they didn't hint that the older skyscale would die and it does die in the end. Damn son.
---
oh dont get me wrong the base mist shard coat is fucking superb and im surprised anet seemed to favour medium armour for once
---
Yeah, just that the weapon in question (assuming it's for a relevant type to you - the options are sword, dagger, GS, scepter, or shield) is much quicker to obtain than normally making an ascended weapon.
---
The story impact is, obviously, subjective. If the characters aren't really doing it for you, then that's fair.
---
Beat map design in MMO. Worth.
---
If only sylvari could be half as masculine, not only in beards but in body builds and facial options.
---
I’d kill for a human male musculature and jawlines as sylvari.
---
Since it's a drop from story, not from achievements, you can always try to complete the chapter with another character.
---
Don't be discouraged by that, level 30 is attainable in the blink of an eye.
---

---
Is this the first appearance of Zafirah?
---
This issue should disappear during the week, as most people will get their gloves. I think the main design issue with this is having the gloves tied to one specific type of events, rather than "do 100 events in dragonfall" (every champ is an event so you'd probably get this in 4 metas max anyway)
---
Yeah. I know that is pretty small age. But Guild Wars 1 stayed for 7 years before release of Guild wars 2. This is source of my concerns. But I get what you mean.
---
literal worst system for a mount ever for a completely mediocre mount too. Hard Pass
---
Good point I must say.
---
Dungeons are not fully dead. They arent just as popular as other instanced content.
---
You can always glance at the lfg when the time comes, or make your own squad. I'm sure a few people from Reddit would be willing to tag along with you too if need be :)
---
OH OK I SEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT
---
Profitable map wide meta events on all 4 maps, gen 2 legendary weapons, raid legendary armor
---
:'( i feel sorry for you young blood
---
Yes to sylvari beards. No to this artwork of a human with green body paint and leaves glued to his face.
---
Jumping off clifss can be done right there and doesn't require waiting for any world boss. Since it can be done in less than 10 mins, it's actually faster than waiting for the next boss that may have a high chance to get players downed.
---
And not everyone can spam downed healing as much as blood magic necromancers.
---
PICNIC
---
Im assuming after troublesome you unlock skyscale cause the next collection says flying skyscale or what ever. In Core maps.
---
There's more where that came from!
---
probably not discussed before because it's the biggest nonissue posted here in a long while
---
Why don't you go MSPaint a shitty low-effort meme about it.
---
Staff doesnt bring any conditions. If you enjoy staff, play power renevant/herald. You can bring swords on weapon swap and just enjoy the powerful smacks you are pulling off.
---
your world map is a spoiler then.
---
Number 1 best build IMO is Condi boonshare tempest. It's arguably the perfect Ele build for me because you don't have attunement swapping or complex rotations. You basically hit your utilities off cooldown for the most part and remember to use blast skills in fire fields. Easily gives yourself and anyone around you 25 might and fury meanwhile I've seen enemies with 25+ burning without really paying attention to what I'm doing. It's still Ele, so you can still dip out of fire to heal in water or get tanky in earth, do power damage in air. But honestly for a lot of trash stuff I just pop the fire signet and walk away. I use Balthazar runes since they have nice synergies with the build and also give you a flat 10% extra health to help you stay alive.
---
As for race, I only have an asura and I think that looks good. Your fire overload makes you bounce and spin which is A+.
---
Condi Boon tempest for the versatility and the tagging ability maybe, but I reaally enjoy all 3.
---
Also where I can find builds for dungeons? Cause on Metabattle I only found for fractals.
---
I am playing on Warrior.
---
Are you done yet with your asslicking, pathetic reddit freakshow?
---
It's most likely a leftover of the original plans they had for all generation 2 legendaries where you had to salvage the 2 earlier precursors for spirits to craft the better versions, and decided to not bother with any mechanic to destroy the previous versions after they decided full collections are too much work. If anything, they're pretty handy for stat selectable exotics if you don't feel like ascended gearing an alt.
---
I've done Tarir a few times, seems decent.
---
Personal preference in the end, I suppose. But I've been enjoying the second and third step of Skyscale far more than I enjoyed the beetle. Especially the part of getting to see them grow - both grew as you completed achievements, but it didn't really matter or affect me with the beetle. Just a "oh that's cool" moment, but with the Skyscale I'm actually looking forward to how much bigger it gets the next day.
---
For elementalist open world, tempest is the best spec to play by far. It has great self buffing, great cleave, great burst, can go both melee and range and by using earth instead of fire or arcane (i always play FA in open world) u will have great protection uptime. With earth u can also take the sigil trait so your healing will keep its passive even after activation which translates into perfect sustain. I even managed to solo most of the HoT hero points with this kind of build in full zerker gear.
---
I would recomment scepter/warhorn or scepter/dagger. Dagger/warhorn or dagger/dagger are also good but you cant kite when facing difficult enemies.
---
As one of the players banned in the April banwave, I don't really think you can blame the mods for removing threads. If you had proof you were innocent, they let the thread remain. One of the main issues with the April banwave was that we couldn't even get enough information out of support to provide that proof. It sucks, but letting people just post about every ban individually would get out of hand very, very quickly.
---
The issue you bring up with map population is a long running one.  Look at all LWS3 and LSW4 maps and population varies based on newness and farming.  It's really sad for anyone needing/wanting achievements in the older maps.  Even with Istan when people were farming it, it was hard to get 5 ppl to show up to meteor strikes even if the farm was on break.  Getting achievements also became hard since  no one would help, again even if farm was on break.  That last captain in istan pirate area took a long while to get with only 3-4 ppl showing up.
---
Anet, at some point, needs think about scaling.  Not to nerf ut, but not need 10 ppl min to think about being able to do it.  Make it "possible" with 5 tryhards
---
After this one there should be last one called Ridding Skyscale I belive. Making sadle and learning how to fly.
---
Do I have to wait another day, when I finished this one?
---
You craft a weapon and realise that i actually turned out really badly so you try again until you're happy.
---
&gt;Should I get Leatherworking high enough to craft exotics when I hit 80? (I plan for ascended in the long run).
---
i'd say yes if you plan on getting ascended eventually
---
&gt;How do I start the legendary crafting lines?
---
get a character to 80 and the necessary Crafting disciplines to level 500 (weaponsmith for dagger and  Huntsman for warhorn) and complete the legendary crafting masteries (which requires 19 core mastery points)
---
I found this build that looks ok-ish.
---
Has the weapons I’d want to use (maybe alternate WarHorn and Torch)

---
Do I need to be 80 to start the legy crafting quest? And does the mastery-levels follow account or character?
---
You should be able to see all of that on Gw2efficiency
---
&gt; Name one thing I have said that was not true.
---
Like everyone you said before. ;)
---
Yeah sure, bomb the group half your size then run from green. Pussies.
---
You can also use the ley lines that form once a weak point is killed.
---
Just stand in one, float up a bit, then activate your glider. Works better if you have the mastery
---
Agreed. And now that I think of it, there aren't any branded enemies in Istan unless the meteor drops which is also on a 15-min CD. So farming Rose Quartz reliably is next to impossible.
---
Huntsman is for Warhorn and Shortbow, right?
---
Might do that then. Cheers!
---
Can I get ascended/legendaries if I kbly do open world and dungeons? Or do I need raids and high lv fractals for that?
---
Don't get stuck with just one way since there are tons of ways to make gold in gw2.
---
* Daily crafting of ascended materials. List on TP for profit.
---
* Daily crafting of mawdrey related items. Grow lamp, clay pot, etc, list of TP for profit.
---
* Daily Scout Mapping Materials. Save and use on a profitable week.
---
* Dailies for 2g.
---
* Daily rewards for meta events in all HoT maps. Besides all the loot, you get a gemstone worth 1.5g in the TP.
---
* Keeping tabs on the economy. This patch saw a price decrease on ectos, increase on mithril and grow lamps, and a new skyscale food item you can craft and sell on TP.
---
Pretty sure I'm missing something, but once you get all done with timegated stuff farming comes next. Volatile and Unbound Magic can be farmed all day and used to buy crates you open and sell the contents on TP. HoT metas can be farmed all day (without de 1.5g gemstone) and we all know how much loot those give you. The new map is not shabby at all with rewards, the price drop on ectos is thanks to the increased supply of them from that map.
---
And poor ppl with arthritis can just call a Mesmer!
---
C’mooooooon, you know you love him!
---
To add to what was said, i find holosmith very fun. It's my go-to power DPSer in raids, I also use it for open world lately in the new map.
---
I'll have to say that leveling an engi was hella annoying for me tho. Since the core weapons are ass, you pretty much rely on bomb + grenade kit all throughout the leveling process. Definitely use tomes of knowledge if you got some laying around.
---
kew kewl
---
Better!
---
Not sure if you're looking for a sword or greatsword, but I think this is closer and just costs karma:
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ebon\_Vanguard\_Sword\_(skin)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ebon_Vanguard_Sword_(skin))
---
Okay sass aside, yes they are at least looking at it. It was announced on the forums that the designers meet and reevaluate the collection. Rejoyce.
---
I would prefer a greatsword given the size of Ike’s sword, but that does look good.
---
Technically, the artist is whitewashing all of the cast. So I'm in the clear.
---
/s
---
&gt; So they created mankind on Tyria, 
---
not so much created as brought them from another world/universe (along with the forgotten).
---
Yes, check the link I post credit to at the top, it'll tell you what happens each day. I'm just simplifying it as I have time to go through it.
---
Sure may as well in-between the massive pointless time gate \o/
---
They can't design maps around the skyscale, because they can't guarantee anyone will have it in another map.  Have you noticed that the beetle is almost unused since episode 3?
---
Waiting 4 fucking days that does not add anything except for a time gate IS maufactured playtime. Hell its not really playtime if you can call throwing food down your skyscales throat 3 times a day.
---
Oops. Will leave it in for spelling nazi bait.
---
It's the best content in the game.
---
Oof
---
The maps are made to be frustrating until you get some of the masteries. Once you get them though, they are super easy to traverse. I still come back to the HoT maps daily to do their metas
---
:P
---
Weekends exist. It's up to 3 WORKdays usually, in most cases they're faster.
---
i bought the expansions yesterday and whenever i my ip changes for whatever reason i cannot log in because of authentication, which is really annoying.
---
Probably this won't help but Twitch (which is a bigger service than a game) support is the worst. It took 6 weeks to reply to my ticket. So a few days I find it pretty ok. Good luck with your ticket though
---
It's entirely possible that they have a ton of tickets to deal with with both the sale being on and a lot of people coming back for the new release. Stuff like you're going through is particularly hairy because stuff has to be checked carefully. They don't want to give the account to the wrong person. Depending on how many people are in your situation (probably it's more than you think), and because there is a queue, it takes longer than you think it should.
---
A couple of days wait isn't unreasonable under the circumstances. Some things are easier and faster to get to, some require more time and care, and probably go to a smaller subset of the support staff. Not all support staff handle the same types of requests.
---
Hmmm well I think I'd wanna go for Harrier gear so I can play that spec - but as a fresh 80 I'll probably have a hard time getting through content whilst farming it right? 
---
Like if you were playing on a fresh 80 rev - what is the first thing you would work towards? [thanks a lot for reply btw]
---
Problem is that the meta changes, and it's not really possible to tell when.
---
Decent, stable options are power Herald (zerk), condi Renegade (viper), alacrity Renegade (diviner). Heal Renegade uses Harrier although you can Magi temporarily if you're still gearing up. If you wanna play fracs you can go with any of these really.
---
For raids it depends more on your team comp and whether you wanna play DPS or support. Learning both makes it easier to put you on a team and therefore makes it easier to pick up a spot for training. But I think it would be slightly easier to get a spot as DPS because alacrity Ren needs a FB and heal Ren a Druid already in the team.
---
For starters get Berserker Equipment (Power, Precision and Ferocity), allmost every class works great with fullzerk. You can get it from WvW, dungeon vendors or simply buy it from the Tradingpost.
---
Berserker set help you completing the story on easy mode since you will oneshot bosses and keep the fightduration to a minimum. Look up guides for your class from [snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/raids) or [discretize](https://discretize.eu/builds). 
---
If you care about Mounts go into PoF first, you won't really get a good sense of the story since you lack living story seasons wich fill holes between your personal story, HoT and PoF. Without having access to those you can't make sense of many plots for they got introduced during different episodes, for example I started PoF and Balthazar came from nowhere ...
---
I recall people wanting reasons to replay old content, "it's just sitting there not being used". This is literally what people have requested. Re-purposing old content.
---
We get a piece of food for free? Definitely saving for the Ley Line then!
---
Thanks so much for the reply -
---
So I'd be hoping to play healer rev - so the first thing I should do is get some magi gear and then slowly get harrier? Is it going to make my low level fractals/world content super hard?
---
Join the legendary dick riders of Elona
---
4 years is a lot but 1.6k is very little time into this game especially after 4 years.  That's about 1 hour of playing the game on average per day.  A lot of people that have been playing for 4 years have 5 times the playtime.  OP here is just a casual that logs in, presses 1 on easy content for an hour then logs out.
---
HoT and PoF are very different in style.
---
If you like huge meta events and replayable maps HoT is your go-to.
---
critics will tell you they are too hard and complex.
---
if you like Exploring and be a bit more chill (closer to core tyria) PoF is your go-to expansion. 
---
critics will tell you they lack replayability.
---
Decide for yourself what you want from the game.
---
Nothing but hte best for our supreme overlord
---
I feel the same about Requiem armor. There's just so much difference between Elegy and Requiem and I'd love upgraded Elegy without the huge, glowy fx.
---
Oh my god
---
The order is:
---
* Personal story
---
* Season 1
---
* Season 2
---
* HoT
---
* Season 3
---
* PoF
---
* Season 4
---
For better gear you want ascended but that takes a lot of money to craft. Try farming some gold and buying first a full set of exotic armor, weapons and trinkets from the TP. Exotics are somewhat cheap, the stats are nearly the same as ascended and in case you don't like the build you can just buy another one.
---
yeah its just strange -.- and when you do pvp/wvw or mesmer content  it gets even worse most of the time
---
...If that's the case I'll be receiving it next year...
---
Yeah, though it relies a lot on kiting and terrain usage. Usually any 1vsX with an enemy that applies high range pressure goes south fast ;)
---
Warclaw also tempts people to go melee to initiate the fight (e.g. necro at 5:25), which can be a very bad idea.
---
They should have removed the time gate between collections and everything would have been fine.
---
I'll have to check it out! I hope more people take screenshots and make little edits of their own, it's a fun creative exercise and appeals to the photographer in me
---
You cant tag up in Suns Refuge or join a squad while inside...guess I never thought about trying it before hand but I imagine it's like a home instance and you can't.  Targeting mobs or objects can be done anywhere in the world
---
I downloaded the map but probably unpacked it wrong. You also said 'update to latest' taco (.exe), and that's where trouble started as it i didnt have dropbox account, so i made a mess out of it. 
---
Lessons learned: all in one pack or any: paste (without unpacking) in the right folder (poi folder).
---
Don't focus on taco.exe latest, it probably just works. 
---
Dragonfall is not after thunderhead peaks (somehow i expected it, but it's alphabetical haha).
---
Remove and activate one of the collection items to make sure you know wich icon stands for wich collection, that's how i got scales to work.
---
Don't download the folder twice, the   (1 ) renaming probably makes it fail to work.
---
Anyway, now i understand a bit how it works xd I also looked to much on other places (like collectibles) to see where it is.
---
You do because it requires masteries. They are account wide.
---
number 9 links to the 2nd day achievement and not to raising. good work though and thank you
---
Lol ESO, only mmo with worse combat flow is wow... and all those non namers.
---
Okay, so Condi Renegade (full Viper's gear) has the highest dps of revenant builds, but that's mostly for raids as fractals favour power dps. You can still pull some pretty good dps in fractals on condi renegade, but you'll do worse the better your teammates are due to them killing/phasing the target before your condis have ramped up. Despite that, it's honestly still good enough for 99cm, though I'm not sure if I'd want to brave 100cm on it, and good luck finding a group that lets you anyway. Also, fractals tend to have more going on at once than raids that can stop you from just doing your rotation, and it can get kind of tedious having to constantly manage getting your energy below 10 before swapping legends because you couldn't just do your rotation so couldn't spend all the energy you needed to. I was still using Baelfire runes last time I brought condi renegade to fractals though, so it's probably a bit worse with Nightmare ones.  
---
Power Renegade (full Berserker's) doesn't do enough dps or burst to be meta, but again it's honestly fine for most fractals (though you're reliant on Quickness to do dps, so make sure you're in a group with someone who's doing that before trying to bring power Renegade anywhere. Once again it's good enough for 99cm so long as the group isn't looking for the most meta stuff for the quickest run, and 99cm groups seem to be fairly laid back nowadays. I've only done 100cm with guildmates so far so I don't know how strict pug groups are for that, but I certainly wouldn't count on being able to bring power Renegade there.  
---
DPS Alacrity Renegade (Diviner's/Berserker's mix) - if a fractal group is asking for any sort of revenant, 99% of the time it'll be this (though usually you'll see groups with a renegade looking for a firebrand - where'd all these renegades come from? I'd have figured everyone having a dragonhunter would mean people would switch to doing the firebrand side of things and renegade would be in high demand. Oh well.) If you're gearing up exactly one renegade build and don't mind playing a support role with lacklustre dps, this is probably the one you'll have the easiest time getting into meta groups with (though groups looking for 3x dps instead of 1x alacrity source may make that wrong if people are more welcoming to power renegade than I think). An important thing is that you don't need full Diviner's gear - apparently something like 78.3% boon duration is technically enough for 100% alacrity uptime if you use Orders from Above perfectly off cooldown, so you want to shoot for a bit more than that. Also with 150AR fractal potions give 15% boon duration, so probably either shoot for ~85% without potions to cap it with for the safer option, or if you're confident maybe something like 70-75% without potions. Either way, don't waste your time getting full Diviner's. This gives this a fair amount of gear overlap with power renegade as well, making it a little cheaper to gear them both if you're on a tight budget (they do use different runes and some sigils so you can't cheap it completely, though you don't strictly need the 6th Superior rune of the Pack bonus so you can get away with a little).
---
Healer Alacrity Renegade (Harrier's/mix with Magi maybe?) - People generally want the Firebrand in Firebrand/Renegade to do the healing, but once in a blue moon you'll see a group looking for Harrier's Renegade to do the healing instead (while still providing alacrity). Like with Diviner's, you don't need full Harrier's to get sufficient boon duration. Concentration is a minor on Harrier's vs major on Diviner's so you'll be getting less from your gear, but there's a trait you take in I think Salvation that gives you some concentration. Also, Ventari's heal utility also gives alacrity when traited so you don't even have the same target number as your absolute minimum. I'm honestly not sure what the minimum target number is as I forgot about Ventari heal giving alacrity when gearing it up myself so went for the same ballpark as Diviner's. Anyway, unless you have some friends who want you on Harrier's renegade, you'll probably never actually end up using this one. It is still a build you could plausibly end up using in fractals though, so I'm mentioning it for completion's sake.  
---
Magi's healer - This hasn't been a thing you can bring to fractals in years. There's just no point giving a vital party slot to just healing when Harrier's Renegade/healing quickness Firebrand can bring healing plus an important boon.
---
The best way to learn:-P
---
Minis are constructs. Made by zommorroz I believe
---
Awesome- great guide. And the music, wow &lt;3
---
I believe that every 20th reward gives you 10x the material so it's a lot better to use them in larger amounts.
---
Here I have been thinking the opposite.  The map completely relies on springers so much that no though was put in to the height of terrain.  I don't know how many times I have been walking and had to get my springer out to get over a small ledge.  I feel like the designers just worked under the assumption of "they'll just use their mount to get over that"
---
Even better if you don't mind extra loading screens!
---
I'm not taking a side here, I personaly feel rather indifferent towards the time gating, but the 'reasoning' is probably like this: As culmination of the story line, that begun with heart of thorns the player should get some sort of fulfillment by riding on Aurene. This happened in the story, albeit in a limited fashion. Now the player could not get Aurene as a permanent mount for obvious reasons. So the skyscale enters the picture. Of course a mount out of nothing has no emotional connection to the player at all. So they try some sort of built up. If you look closely some of the tasks mirror the things you did with Aurene (hide-and-seek, nest building etc.). Even the teaching of morals is touched, though this would seem rather odd towards a simple animal (we never taught our Springer not to steal carrots either). It's quite obvious that there is a try to recreate parts of the journey the player too alongside Aurene. The point from protecting her egg to finally riding on her took quite a while too. So the whole process seems like a miniature recreation of Aurenes arc to build up some emotional connection. If this is really necessary and how much it falls apart as soon as the skyscale in replaced by the inevitable theme-changing skins that will arrive sooner or later is a completely different matter of course. I'm just saying I think I can see where they are coming from and what they are aiming at.
---
Depends on where you stand in the rest of the game. Is this your first level 80? Do you already do fractals on a different character? Do you have any ascended boxes lying around that you could stat change to a different combination? etc...
---
If you don't have any of those extra things to fall back on, I'd suggest by starting with an exotic set of berserker gear from dungeons or the tp, and slowly work to get ascended armor pieces as you go. You can use living story map currencies to buy ascended trinkets with choosable stats really quickly, and the new LS map has access to the choice of harrier stats, and then slowly work up through fracs to get your ascended armor.
---
I'd recommend sticking with a damage focused build for T1/T2 fracs though. They're easy enough to not need a healer at all. If it were me, I'd probably play a different class until i had the gear ready, but that's just me. For example, I made an alt account about a year ago, starting fresh, not sending mats from my main account across to speed it up. I made an engineer, boosted to 80, did some dungeons to get exotic berserker gear, while farming LS maps to get asc trinkets, then did fractals and some collections that give ascended armor boxes as rewards, and the deadeye rifle collection for an ascended weapon. Then slowly stocked up boxes from fracs, until i could stat change them all to vipers for a different character.
---
I think the key thing is just that power dps gear is really easy to get exotics for. You CAN get an exotic set of vipers or harriers or whatever, but it's generally more expensive or painful than it's worth for armor you'll throw away, and cheaper versions don't really do the job well enough.
---
I tried playing healer firebrand through LS3 story (second playthrough, wanted a challenge). Don't play healer for open world. Your fights will just be draggy for no reason.  Against specific story bosses it's useful but 99% of the time your best bet is to kill things before they kill you. Unless you're actually supporting a friend, then that's a different story.
---
You can definitely play low to mid fracs with Magi though, then work on Harrier slowly. In fracs mechanics are usually the most important, like knowing where to stand so you won't die. Gear won't help much if you die to mechanics.
---
Its one reason why I do not agree with a new map every LW ep. It's too much and the population is not there to sustain all these maps. They should add parts to existing maps for LW and just save new maps for like mid LW season.
---
&gt; The fact that they did the ritual again doesn't mean Illyra lied, it means the Forgotten found another geographically suitable location.
---
Not lies, unreliable narrator. Incomplete knowledge, retcons, exact words or whatever.
---
&gt; I'm not sure how that goes into our discussion or is a point against anything I've said?
---
The Pale Tree does not appear to be reproducing sexually. We also have no evidence of Glint doing so. Mating does not seem to be a factor distinguishing scions from minions.
---
&gt; I don't see how the water bit is relevant, and I think it's pretty clear what the difference is between a human's mean of reproduction, and turning clay into flesh. 
---
Who said anything about turning clay into flesh? Actually, plants *do* turn clay, air, water and sunlight into "flesh" in real life but we have very complex laws of chemistry and physics describing these processes and some reasonably rigid boundaries on what we consider "biological" or "life". We cannot apply any of these to Tyria because its natural laws are quite obviously different from ours. Answer me on the Chak, do they qualify as "life", "biological" or a "species" despite feeding on ley energy which very clearly is **not** present in real life organic chemistry?
---
&gt; But that isn't biological reproduction. It's corruption.
---
No, corruption is the process of infusing anything, alive, dead, inbetween or otherwise, with some combination of domain-pure magic and an additional spell or message representing the dragon's hivemind. Kralk and Jormag clearly display that corruption can exist without animation and the same is implied for Zhaitan's grip on Orr. All of this has no direct bearing on the act of reproduction as far as I can tell but dragon minions are by definition corrupted so if *they specifically* intend to reproduce then corruption must necessarily occur prior or during the process.
---
I'm not sure on the terminology to distinguish fertile offspring from intentionally sterile individuals i.e. workers vs. drones+princesses. Especially when it comes to fantasy-only variants such as conjuration, animation, non-cyclic golem assembly and Risen Spider chestbursters.
---
"Biological" is the part I'm completely lost on. What does and does not constitute "biology" or "life" in Tyria? Animals at the very least seem to have souls but then there's spirits, Titans and Gorseval. Chak function just like a RL insect hive would but feed off of leyline energy rather than any chemical metabolism. That same energy also feeds dragon minions however. Djinn are sapient with their own culture and everything, possibly experience love (Zohaqan and Ziya+Vemyen) unless we are merely projecting and based on Zommoros' horror at the end of W6 *they* certainly consider *themselves* to be "alive" yet by all accounts I know they "physically" are upstart elementals, complex and intelligent yet still composed of elemental magic rather than flesh, blood or wood.
---
&gt; a group of living organisms consisting of similar individuals capable of exchanging genes or interbreeding. The species is the principal natural taxonomic unit, ranking below a genus and denoted by a Latin binomial, e.g. Homo sapiens.
---
Okay, what are our Tyrian definitions of "living", "organism" and "genes"? Or, if someone built self-replicating robots entirely out of organic materials would those qualify?
---
Sylvari are "alive" in the sense of being sapient and possessing souls. They are "organisms" in the sense of falling under the Tyrian definition of "plants". They are sterile but have limited shape-shifting abilities (aka growing vines and possibly "clothing" or cultural armour from their bodies) and can exchange *information* via the Dream or simply by talking. In fact the Dream functions much like RL interbreeding but only for the *minds* of the new sylvari, or at least I am not aware of their physical characteristics also being affected. Is that enough to qualify as a "species" even though they depend on the Pale Tree for reproduction (closer to a virus than an uncontested living being) and being spawn of dragon minions might not contain any DNA or RNA?
---
Okay, Thank you for notifying me.
---
2 exiled gods?
---
So one thing that isnt being mentioned is a warrior needs a good squad to sustain them, even with fb/scrapper support you can get iced pretty easy. If your having a hard time staying up run defense trait lines. If your still having a hard time transfer to mag we love teaching new and returning players meta builds and how to best utilize them with a cohesive meta comped squad ;D
---
Actually, it is Raising Skyscale. The title may not say so, but the collection is for Raising Skyscale.
---
Thank you so much for this guide, the effort you put in for everyone to use is incredible, well done!
---
Not sure what you mean by rotating bosses.  I was talking about wrathbringer, matriarch (mat), and hydra, which have to be killed within 30 sec of each other.  You cant zerg kill them, have to have ppl at each, too short of a timer to kill one and move to next.  If people would listen you "could" zerg one down to 5% or so (I would start) at wrath, zerg to matriarch, get it to 5 leave a few ppl, and then zerg to hydra, and kill.  You can shrine and get back to wrath/mat with 10 sec left if you hustle with griffon if the ppl there need help.  If ppl really want to do it and are dedicated it totally should be doable with 15 ppl total, but generally you need more since some ppl are lazy and lie dead or just spam 1.
---
Wvw is banging right now mate come to mag if your server is dead.
---
I was sorta thinking maybe stop at 20 at one boss- move on and so. As in not doing all the bosses at once
---
I was thinking of adding to my post that maybe it would be nice if Living World Season 5 did what LWS2 did and use current maps to lead to an expansion like LWS2 did with HoT.
---
if its just about height, thats exactly what i use the tube for.
---
the 2nd one shoots you higher than you could ever get with just the springer. cancel that one at the highest point, get on your griffon and enjoy your flight to anywhere on the map - yes, even underworld and melandru areas, including the wing.
---
Wait a month and you won't see a difference. Everyone that wants it now will have it. All the casuals will complete it as they go.
---
LOL! Just Hilarious!
---
This is where Anet's new focus on weekly bonus events can really help the game.  Have one week where all the events tied to a collection/season/map get bonus rewards and players will surge there, giving everyone a chance to complete various goals.  Rotate it in once or twice a year and new players won't get stuck on old group content.
---
it links to the saving collection
---
On Guild Chat the Narrative team said that when he says that he hopes Aurene never has to kill what she loves that he was referring to Glint. That's straight from the source. The mother comment was not explained but it's apparent that was not in reference to Glint.
---
Remember too, her followers, the original Druids were often once people who showed her devotion.
---
I'm really sad that people discover this mini dungeon because they are "forced" to do it for the Skyscale collection. I stumbled on the Dwarven Ruins when exploring the map with a friend, and it was so much fun, maybe the best piece of content I've had in the PoF maps. And now this is becoming hated by most of the playerbase because they just want to rush it to get the Skyscale as fast as possible.
---
I've counted 6-8.  Can't tell if it is due to random damage and/or which character I'm on and/or group scaling, but sometimes they require more than 6.
---
I more expect either the S4 Raid legendary trinket, or something they add in LS5 EP1, to cost a massive number of ectos to craft, a la Koda's Warmth.
---
I quite like that theory.
---
and don't i know that? i have a dynamic ip with different ranges, it saved one of them not the other, so i keep restarting my router until im in the trusted ip range.
---
It's a shame we couldn't have the GW1 shrines. They were so much nice than these stone... replicas...
---
The main issue I found with that spider room was getting swarmed when multiple people triggered spiders and they all go for one person, not bad otherwise. It was a fun little mini dungeon I had otherwise missed.
---
I mean, you're complaining about it so maybe you forgot - also, little reminder that you set it up.
---
For **Skyscale of Life** go to [Town of Nageling](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Town_of_Nageling)  in Diessa Plateau when the giant boss is up… takes about a minute
---
is there a normal way to get on it?
---
I 100% agree and for some reason I thought I read somewhere that anet wants to go back to existing maps and expand. Cant really find atm as I dont know if it was on reddit or their site, plus I am at work &gt;&lt;
---
So glad more ppl get to see the puzzle  :)
---
Who dat be?
---
Yeah, our map was completely full and we all got the popup. I'm pretty sure it's a bug.
---
Trying to install this and the only install files I see are
---
- installer.cpp
---

How do I run that? I checked to see if Windows Defender did something with the .exe file, which the readme says to do, but I am not seeing anything there, or any warnings regarding that.
---
For the gods there is a lot of explicit lore - some concerning abaddon in gw1, some concerning Grenth in gw1 and 2.
---
This is normal, keep making it remember and it will eventually stop and grab all your IP range, i had to do it like 3~4 times

"Can you hear my song echo through the dakneeess?"
---
Yeah, walked in with a Mirage that I haven't geared yet. No ranged weapons either. It was hell. But at this point I didn't want to swap to Holo/Reaper and redo the entire puzzle. I think the most fustrating part is realising you have to turn your brain on for this one.
---
Glad I never have to see spiders again!

"spider leg treat"

---
Did you select the soulbeast trait line in the hero tab? It must be the bottom row of the three, by the way.
---
Boon chrono IS an offensive build nowadays. He didnt ask specifically for a DPS build. But whatever. I really cant be bothered to discuss with downvote heroes.
---
I'm still hoping that they add a recipe that allows us to mystic forge a normal asc weapon to a Stellar one.
---
And yeah, it should have been clear before launch that the nodes being somewhat gated behind an active map is an issue...
---
Mesmer?
---
Conjuring is based on magic , warrior is not a magic / sorcerer  to conjure weapons. 
---
I believe you are talking about  a battle mage ?
---
Rifle Engineer for rocket jumps!
---
Yeah mesmer’s your best bet, I think.
---
Go to Wayfarer Foothills. There's Minotaurs around Osenfold Waypoint and Alpine Skelk around Doldenvan passage ( in the water )
---
Don't play a human FEMALE
---
In before a rooster skin for the raptor...
---
Yeah, mesmer can dual-wield swords and is a robe class. You could also enhance the jedi theme with him, cause, like, he is an illusionist, so he can manipualte minds like jedi. Also telikenesis (gs auto, for example).
---
Your fault for that one. You chose that skin.
---
Yes. I'll certainly be tipping if I end up catching a port.
---
Awesome thanks for the great reply!
---
Ok thank you for the detailed reply!
---
No, not a battle mage. 
---
For example, wells are magical on necromancers, but they aren't magical on scrappers. Utility skill types are descriptive of a mechanic and not necessarily of a theme.
---
The animations of my desired weapon-master warrior elite specialization will not be magically-enhanced. The theme will focus in on being a weapon hoarder/crafter/gatherer who can supply allies with various environmental weapons during combat to increase their team's overall versatility.
---
You can even find some [pups](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sand_Pup) in Sun's Refuge courtesy of Ziya.
---
Warrior, revenant, and mesmer can dual wield swords and you can use the Arcane outfit for the robe part.
---
Mesmer. Robe-like armor is only available for light armor class. Necro cannot use swords, and Elementalist can only use a sword in main hand with Weaver elite spec.
---
I also see you have the holosmith sword. Good, good.
---
Underrated comment. Yes, outfits can bypass armor restrictions.
---
I really, REALLY hope if they come out with yet ANOTHER material/currency for Season 5, that it's ONLY ONE and **not one per map.**
---
I originally thought that the first three scavenger hunts (scales, sick bois, and eggs) were each timegated separately, so I took my time with the scales because I both didn't want to get burnt out and thought that I'd only have to wait after I finished it. Now that I finished all three, I don't know which would be worse, having to wait a day between each scavenger hunt, or knowing that we were expected to do all three in one day (especially since, lorewise, the only part that mattered was getting a single egg). 
---
They really should remove the first day's collections or, better yet, remove the timegates for the main collections, especially since we're already timegated with charged quartz and feeding. I don't want to be rushed to do a bunch of stuff in a single day, just to be rewarded by waiting. I want to go at my own pace, at least for more involved things (that is, the collections. I'm fine with the daily feeding, since it's just a little work each day). 
---
Besides the first day and timegates on timegates on timegates, the collections seem pretty cool, but saying the pacing leaves something to be desired is a massive understatement.
---
I died when I heard the clip, and now I'm dying again. Beautiful.
---
D-Did you just… oh nvm
---
Or my house.
---
And you do understand that's the job of game developers right? 
---
Create, adapt  .... Right? 
---
What is the point of creating a game and keeping it out of date ? 
---
Adding new content and components is the essence to make something keep running right? 
---
But you probably right... Is to much work to ... " Work " in something good and new, that would give more reasons to play this game .
---
They probably should never add new haircuts aswell.... who da hell wants that... And the render and graphical updates who cares about it? 
---
This game should actually be as good as when it was at it's first day.
---
:P 
---
Things need to change and adapt! Or they turn themselves into " another one" .
---
 I gave and creat this post because I like the game, as you do, and not adding new content or components to the game or not even updating it is not what you want for sure ;) .
---
You're the one making the assertion that I told a lie.
---
&gt; Nah, I ~~made my request first.~~ insulted you over and over again, lied several times and demanded things you already wrote.
---
I corrected you a little bit, you*re welcome. ;)
---
But hey, you "mAdE YoUr rEqUeSt fIrSt, sO I hAvE tO fOlLow yOuR dEmAnDs". You're hilarious. xD
---
Really ? Why ? Are they reworking the metas ?
---
this is very informative thank you very much i just hope it won't take long
---
Not at all, gurdian, quite ironically, is a dps class. It excels at burst both power based and condi based. 
---
It has very low hp so its not a passive tank, no class but reaper are and even reaper isnt a passive tank like the ones in wow or swtor or other stabdard mmo. 
---
Tanking in gw2 is active. Its using skills and dodging to keep aggro(which is hard because theres no aggro system like other mmos) because in gw2, enemies usually hit hard enough to 4-5 shot you so the best way to live is not get hit at all.
---
Wow, that’s so stupid. „I Paid for a game so i want my 80lvl with full legendary and fully unlocked masteries without playing”
---
And you never proved me wrong. Seems I'm right.
---
To trigger the collection, you have to beat Episode 6. However, you will need access to an instanced area that you get through playing through Episode 4 (I believe) to continue with the collection, and will need to at least start each episode to gain access to their respective maps, or teleport to a friend, in order to do most collections.
---
Harrier was that power/prec/healing gear, right? I cant check it right now because Im at work but if yes then I suppose it could work if you really want to be a healer everywhere.
---
Wasn't he part of the Inquest when the Asura used Sylvari as subjects for their experiments? It's been a while but I remember seeing him in that instance with Caithe with the seeds of memory.
---
Yeah, it sucks when they stand practically on the weak spot.
---
Given hints they've dropped, I expect next week's patch to contain various rebalances for Path of Fire meta events.  Not sure exactly what they'll entail, if it'll be better rewards or putting some of the unscheduled ones on schedules, but we'll see in eight days.
---
Thank you so much!
---
So, because this one thing is too hard to do for the very little playoff it would bring anet in revenue, you assume I just mean they shouldnt work at all and stop creating content? 
---
Thats a huge slippery slope fallacy. 
---
Theres plenty of things they can do that are worth their ressources, new race or weapons are probably not it because of how intensive their ressource-cost would be in man-hour and tech updates. 
---
You dont have to be an extremist.
---
For 5 man content you can go with an even more aggressive build than in raids and drop inspiration in favor of another dps traitline (illusion+dueling+chrono for example), since you dont need the 10man signet.
---
You do about half the dps of a solely dps focused build, but you bring necessary boons (quickness+alacrity) as well as boon extension, higher cc and boon rip.
---
However, the speedclear meta in fractals doesnt include boon chrono anymore. So boon chrono is a bit in a weird spot atm. Most pugs are okay with - or even specifically want - a boon chrono + druid or healfirebrand, speedclearers dont want one, because they run without a dedicated healer.
---
For dungeons the added utility from mass invisibility and veil, as well as portal is quite nice to have, especially in pugs without a thief. Also dps isnt quite such an issue in dungeons, because they never got updated, so you have more dmg than needed anyway.
---
Im sorry for this convoluted post, but ever since anet pushed firebrand + renegade meta, we have had this split in team comp metas, with chrono being best in slot in raids on nearly every boss... but firebrand+renegade doing overall better in 5 man content - if you dont need an extra healer.
---
This kinda let to a split, with speedclearers dropping boon chrono, but pugs still using one per group.
---
So to answer your question: if there isnt already someone supplying quickness + alacrity in the dungeon group, no pug will kick you.
---
Another option to mitigate them, rather than deal with them, is to use projectile blocks/reflects.  Revenants, Guardians and Mesmers should be able to cover players by the weak points in domes, which will stop the turret projectiles and greatly improve survivability.
---
That's not how the world works. Saying something doesn't make it true.
---
You insulted me first, you're the only one here who lied.

---
That readme also says that you need to download release from https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases
---
You can buy stat-selectable trinkets of various types with them, a la Bitterfrost.  Save some Winterberries!
---
Honestly thought the lava room gave me cancer.
---
Mb, misread that part, those windows can only be opened once. What are you trying to achieve with multiple windows?
---
IMO, it's the other way around. Quickbrand can use full berserker to provide 100% quickness, and it deals around the same dps was banner war. On diviner renegade you'll get around 10k max in the real encounters, and honestly using diviner rev is more like a min/maxing strat for experienced group who get enough healing from kalla elite. In most sub 200kp groups you'll probably want to go as healer.
---
Honestly it's the easiest room too. If you use the raptor and jump over pillar arches then basically no enemies spawn. The fire room was much more annoying trying to get out of combat constantly to mount back up.
---
And because a lot of games do it means it's fun? They always claimed they wanted to do something different because it's boring and repetetive, now they are doing the exact same stuff everyone did in the last 15 years and thats the exact reason more and more people get tired of it. Not only in this game but in MMORPG in general.
---
Hey they did get Tara Strong to do some voice work, so that counts for something. Even if it's in the part of the game nobody wants to talk about.
---
The more I think about it, the more I think that this item was an all around bad idea. They should've just let people buy teleports, 5 for 300 gems.
---
It's too easily exploited so they have to nerf it into the ground to the point that its usefulness is minimal.
---
I think I just finished this in the level (60 I think?) story. Can someone explain to me or point me in the direction to understand this meme? I thought that line was funny but whats the meta?
---
People who complain propably didn't bring condition cleanse.
---
You just dont understand the nature of why its hard to do and not worth it. 
---
Of course they could do it, it would take a year, during which they wouldnt make as much progress on the rest of the game. Fractals would stall, raids too. And when its done, it would bring a bit of activity for a while and then slowly dwindle until the numbers are back to normal. They wouldnt sell expac on it, if they do the time they have to out into the elite spec would be lowered so their quality would also be lesser. 
---
Its just not a profitable idea. Anet has thousands of better ways to both make content for players and make money off of that new content. 
---
You seem to think they can just conjure ressources, time and employees out of thin air like magic... They cant. They have to work with what they have and theh need to maximise the amount of money they make.
---
Are are you serious? You really think mount animations are the same as weapons? Do you even play gw2? For mounts, its the same animation for all races and classes, thats not the case for weapons. You need new animations for all races, and then for all classes who can use those weapons. Its exponentially longer.
---
Did they ever fix the bugs with maw of torment where the npcs would wander off?
---
Gets porting mesmer dusted off. Time to make that port gold again boys.
---
Yeah, cause why would they want to reward us for having played regular? That would be crazy.
---
That music... Spot on.
---
Nah. Ecto gambling helps its value.
---
&gt;  Anet wanted the skyscale to be a specific narrative experience where we help the dragons on the new island, find an egg, bring it all over the world to infuse it with love and courage, then raise the hatchling. They wanted it to be a journey, a progressive one that is.
---
The various steps could've been cut to a quarter of their length and still had the same narrative impact. Did we need *21* scale samples, with one hidden beneath the brand meta? Not at all. It could've been 5 scales.  
---
But the hide-and-seek components are dirt simple to add as "content", so they leaned on that and the "collection of collections" recursion to maintain all that busywork.
---
Holosmith sword
---
True, but we all know that playing Fashion Wars 2 as charr is just playing it on hard mode.
---
Maybe they should add a stacking debuff that reduces rewards the more you farm without finishing the meta; don't make it linear, but logarithmic so most players don't actually see any drop in rewards from doing the events up to the meta, but if you skip out on the final part of the meta you end up with a stack that rapidly depletes your rewards after a certain value, and it can only be removed from the character via a timegate (ha) or doing the last event.
---
*laughs* “Good, Anakin, good...”
---
Gonna have to disagree with you here. While you make good arguments, I can make good arguments in the opposite direction (note these are not your quotes, but generic anti-new weapon argument quotes):   
---
* "It wouldn't be profitable." Well it would be since you could monetize black lion skins, or "new weapon packs" through BLTC.
---
* "Too much work for not enough payout." Yeah but you don't know this. Only Anet does. Stop arguing on their behalf. If you legit WANT new weapons, don't let this monetary excuse hold you back! If you legit don't care for new weapons (which I would guess is the case with you), fine, but don't put down other people who want them. If you legit don't want new weapons, I don't believe you. Everyone either wants new weapons or doesn't care if they're included.
---
* "It would be too difficult to do overall." Actually, I'm pretty damn sure the hardest thing to do would be to integrate new weapons into the various games' systems - crafting, trading post, achievements, trait interactions, drop tables, etc. The animations and rigging for the new weapons would not be that difficult. I can elaborate on this if you like.
---
* "Implementing this new weapon with all of the different styles/skins in the game would be way too much work." Yes of course. So then they just don't do it? They could just design a set of base skins (one for each of the basic metals, lvl 1-80, ending with palette swapped ascended versions of the new weapons) and also only design new skins for the weapons going forward.
---
* "The money is better spent elsewhere." I highly disagree. New elite specs/skills/weapons are the #1 thing I care about in the game since I primarily enjoy WvW, LW and expac content, and pvp and I know there are plenty of people like me who play the game.  
---
The consensus on new weapons is not unanimous, you have to understand that. It's fine to bring up financial incentive as a concern, but you shouldn't use it to argue against some1 who proposes new content since you aren't involved with the intricacies of Anet's financial situation. They may very well make new weapons (or hell, something even more amazing that would blow us out of the water) if they see fit.
---
People are freaking out about charged quartz
---
You’d think they’d they were struggling to equip exotics the way they’re behaving. The stuffs dirt cheap to anyone doing even the most basic of activities
---
Go run t4 dailies and you’ll have earned several gold already. Even if you’re a total noob a simple gathering run can earn you a few gold in minutes each day
---
One of them sometimes stall. The rest do not seem to do well unless you've broken the all walls leading to the realm portal.
---
When those walls are broken and enemies are cleared, they kind of zoom straight to the portal.
---
For the record, I agree with you. Adding new weapon types requires so much stuff at this point that it's kind of mind boggling.
---
* 2-5 Skills for at least two core classes, probably more. This means animations for all 5 races too.
---
* One skin per collection for each new weapon. There are a lot of collections in the game that have a skin for every weapon and at some point the new weapons would need these same skins added in.
---
* two legendary weapon variants
---
* modifying every loot table in the game to drop these new weapons.
---
And that's just what I was able to immediately think of.
---
The game is not out of date for not having new weapons (as much as I would loooove a battleaxe) and it would be a lot of manhours to try to add them in at this stage. That is dev time best spent on anything else.
---
So, I'm wondering.. are people still helping others get their Guild hall claims in PUGS? I want to claim the one in Auric Basin with my two man guild, but dunno if other people might be around for me to ask for help, and what's the best way to ask for help anyway? Was considering map chat and LFG or asking on the GW2 discord. :D

Well, I wouldn’t call that influence personally. 
---
Did she gain abilities? Yes. But that would be similar to gaining the ability to read/write.
---
Sorry but I won't bend the knee on this to you m8 we have different ways of knowing what is profit.
---
I know it's longer. I gave an example of a fruit of hours of work, you are reading what I'm typing but you clearly not understanding. 
---
And I do not accept your answer, is just not valid to say : 
---
"Is not worthy because it takes time and people".
---
It would not be worthy if not done right! 
---
Everything done well is profitable in the end !
---
And keeping the game with the limits you have right now is not ! And yes, and play GW2 since it's  1° day.  And that's why I made all this comments as suggestions. 
---
Wherever you like the idea or not it's ok.
---
What not ok is telling : 
---
" Nothing that takes hours and time spent is a risk of money"  , as everything that exists in the market can be good or bad! It depends how you exploit the need and you surpass the limits you impose. 
---
People who stand still because everything takes time tend to be " another one" . While Those who keep walking are followed. 
---
You should start running :P
---
Yeah. That's what I was expecting. It'll probably just work like ArcDPS templates or Diablo armory.
---
That won't change I'd rather have actual templates and unlockable stats and upgrades.
---
Anet will probably "fix" this in 3..2..
---
I mean, you can say whatever you want, it doesnt change the facts that has made the descision based on their numbers and they decided it wasnt worth their effort and that other aspect would make them more money. Maybe theyre wrong but they certainly know more about it than we do. 
---
If they change their minds eventually then im all for it but for now, as far as we know, theyre focusing on the new living world season.
---
&gt; new weapon has the same issue as if they wanted to implement a new race...they "have to" design this weapon for every weaponset already available...especially for those black lion skins. 
---
This is a very valid concern, but I don't think it's entirely accurate. They could just design skins for this new weapon only for all the basic metals level 1-80 (iron, steel, dark metal, mithril, ascended...) and then only add in the BLTC skins for this new weapon going forward.  
---
Additionally, if the new weapon they put into the game was spears or tridents, they could recycle many if not all of the underwater skins (many of which are beautiful but go entirely unappreciated).
---

---
You sound absolutely insane. Like a child who wants to seem smart by using weird quotes about people they know nothing about. 
---
The fact that this is about “bending the knee” to you is further proof of your lack of maturity. Its a discussion, an argumentation, its not a fucking war over who rules a kingdom... 
---
Anyway, you clearly dont care about actually listening to what other people say, so its useless to continue this farce. 
---
Have a good day.
---
I did those rooms for the first time the other day because of the eggs. They were awesome.  Plus 5 free weapon skins, woo!
---
Leveling Mesmer is a pain, but at level 80 it's very rewarding. Honestly level 8 isn't a good indicator of how a class is going to play at end-game. However, both of Mesmer's elite specs are fun to play, yes.

---
Are you looting the big chest at the end? And are you absolutely sure you're killing the right ?
---
Ecto is salvageable into dust. Dust is always profitable as it's used to promote materials.
---
The cheaper ecto gets, the cheaper dust gets, and the more profitable it becomes to get spirit shards and promote materials.
---
&lt;3
---
The new map is so fun and rewarding people are playing the hell out of it, and actually getting stuff for their troubles.
---
No enemy farm gimmicks, no multiloot shenanigans, no chest farms avoiding events since the keys come from events, and the chest also spawn from events. 
---
People are focusing on event success. And so the meta progresses pretty fast, and people are getting a rewarding experience at a good pace.
---
And the events are not too dull even when repeating them because there's 4 different armies in the map with varied skill sets that result in needing different strategies when dealing with different groups of them (e.g: Shadow group with and without monk, with and without elemental).  And since there's so many events and the real rewards come after the meta, it's better to spread about and do all the events rather than sticking with a zerg, so it's easier to tag enemies in events, and fights are more engaging.
---
I'm not sure event ANet has consciously designed this map to be as good as it is. And I'm not sure they'll be able to replicate it in the future, but they would be smart if they tweaked less popular maps to work more like this.
---
My boyfriend and I did this mini dungeon puzzle when PoF first came out. I *hated* that room. My poor bf got downed 50+ times from all the rooting skills the webs cause and poison from the spiders that come down from touching a web. I had to keep rushing back to revive him, only for him to get up and immediately run into *another web* and start the process over again.
---
Have people stopped cheesing the meta? Last I played a while back the zerg would circle the map doing each quarter rather than groups holding them all at once. 
---
I never found that tactic as exciting so I hope people have gone back to playing it as it was designed to be played.
---
There's nothing inside.
---
It was shown in the guild chat about the skyscale. They release a series of volatile energy orbs that the skyscale can gather to gain a higher altitude.
---
If you gather all of the orbs from a rift in one go, you get a bonus, and likely progress to a related Explorer achievement.
---
I've done this thought experiment many times and also asked other players on their thoughts. I think the cheapest, most economical and still most profitable way to include new weapons into the game would be as follows:  
---
1. Tie them to new elite specs. Whether they want to include 1 (for ease) , or 3 (for fairness, so every spec eventually gets one of the) new weapons, I think it would be in Anet's fiduciary interests if the weapons were expac-exclusives.
---
2. The logic: if you think about it, every new elite spec is going to get a new weapon rig made available to their class with the elite spec, and new animations anyways. What does it matter if it's an entirely new weapon, vs. a weapon they can't yet wield (which is effectively an entirely new weapon) ? This would minimize the amount of work that needs to be done to include new weapons (note: NOT make it minimal work, just make it as little work as possible to include new weapons in the game).
---
3. New weapons, new powers, new (next neat thing after mounts... whatever it is) would make for strong marketing points for an mmorpg. That alone would push some sales.
---
4. New weapons, even if they're tied to elite specs would make some money through BLTC. Would it turn a profit? I'm not sure, but it certainly wouldn't just be a giant money sink. 
---
At the end of the day the most important factor here is indeed money like you said. The fact that they haven't already introduced new weapons likely implies monetary issues, and I doubt their financial situation is getting much if any better over time, so yeah, it's unlikely we'll see new weapons. I can tell you for sure though that the various dev teams probably would like to (evidence: LOOK AT ALL THE DAMN LOADING SCREEN ART WITH SPEARS) and certainly is capable of implementing new weapons into the game. It's a matter of whether the money people see it as a good move. They *might* if there was enough support from the playerbase for such an idea! Unfortunately that support never comes because you always get people shooting down ideas like this using these financial arguments... It's a pity :(

Eh, with “feel my wrath” and watchwork portal device, most of mesmer utility is gone. War being quick might gen and banners is still pretty big value. There’s some argument for blinking for mesmers but it’s still pretty small imo.

If you (or your other guildmate) are part of any other guilds, maybe try asking them? That's how my 3-person guild got our guild hall, asking friends from a slightly larger guild one of us was also in.
---
I highly recommend level groups that include a veteran in PoF maps.
---
All except karka can be found in PoF. And I got every treat on the first kill by aiming for groups with a veteran. Often before killing the veteran.
---
I killed them all with a power reaper, since they are pretty good at bunching up enemies and mowing them down in seconds.

For skelk and minotaur in particular, I think the best spot in in Desert Highlands. 
---
* From the waypoint at the dwarven ruins, go west  (with springer or up the slope to the north, then west) and there will be TONS of minotaurs all through the northwest area.
---
* From the same waypoint go east, and you'll see even more skelk fighting the Firebrand elite NPC and back in the cliffs more to the east.
---
Scythe would be aswell as good! :) Derwish like :P
---
Oh! Goodness me, I forgot I can be part of multiple guilds in the game, still a bit of a rookie myself. I will try that, thanks for the advice!
---
the only thing i could find would be glint (he refered to her as "your mother" and there's nothing else it could be)
---
And to add to that, wasn't kralk the 'oposite' dragon for Steve? Like Mordremoth-Zhaitan, Jormag-Primordus, Kralk-Steve?
---
Yes. Did you possibly kill it 4 times in one day, with the first kill being before you unlocked the collection? If so, you can only get loot once per day, so wait until daily reset and kill it again.
---
If not, it might be bugged for you. Try sending in a support ticket.
---
Probably me and a dozen of people didn't bother, yes, and that's exactly why so many complained. It feels underwhelming without the masteries.
---
People arent happy unless everythings served to them on a silver platter, the second they have to do something even mildly inconvenient, its the worst thing in the world =P
---
and that's relevant why?
---
You didn't complete this. Let me fix that for you.
---
&gt; "All our reports go straight into the garbage" is what match manipulators want you to think, so you stop report them and they can keep at it without ever being punished.
---
There. Much better.
---
Because people largely don't want them tied to just an elite spec. If you did that means only a certain percentage of players would ever use the weapons, drops of that weapon type are tied only to a specific map or region, and you still need to make all of the skins for them. Making them be elite spec only makes them even rarer and even less worth making.
---
That might be so ! 
---
I mean, I gave the old content skins idea because someone said it would take time to add them to the black lion / pve content skins aswell.
---
Besides, adding new weapons to new specialisation would be good enought I believe ! :) Would give time for turn them to another classes in the future aswell if needed or intended ! :) 
---
I think it would win :) but opinions are opinions ! And minds don't think alike! 
---
But 1 thing is for sure would be good :)
---
I second soul beast. I just unlocked mine and the two power builds are insanely fun on metabattle for open world. I really enjoy the boon berserker build and I swap greats word with axe/axe. I slaughter everything in wide aoe arcs.
---
DSD's name is actually Skaren (the 'S' is silent) and she's here to speak to our manager.
---
The amount of laurels needed for the Dragonsblood weapons is "only" 80, not 100+. You can get 35-55 every 28 days, depending on what you choose in the last day. Compared to what some other items cost in laurels, it isn't really that much for 16 weapons.

---
They fight for eachothers dragon juice I guess? Theres got to be a reason behind the Rivalries of the dragons outside of.. you know, ''YOU WHAT!?''
---
Don't you love when your wild theories no one believes end up becoming what the devs had planned all along?
---
Same here, tried on different chars as well but it's just not giving me credit for this champ..
---
I agree with heading south will be next
---
I guess I wasn't inclusive enough with my ending, I'll edit it. :) Thanks for the comment!
---
Just feed your damn skyscale and go mow the lawn, life continues.
---
CANTHA YEAAA
---
I know youre getting a lot of negativity but a lot of us played both expansions and most of the playerbase have seen first hand the transition of content styles over the years. 
---
To cut it short the “reward” is the content itself. Youll soon realize that a lot of what us gw2 players want is tied to the content itself. You can give us gold or skins but we throw the words “replayability” around a lot. It means rewards mean less to us than how satisfying the content feel. 
---
HoT is challenging, its very challenging. And honestly it feels dam amazing to achieve through such a complex expansion. Many people hate tangled depths but holy crap is that map a masterpiece. The details are amazing and ive learned to appreciate its complexity. 
---
I hope you dont feel too discouraged about HoT. Itll grow on you just like it did to so many of us.
---
i expected you to mention cantha
---
but i think you put more thought into this then anet did
---
Third auto attack chain on sword human male is performed with the hilt, not the blade.
---
&gt; Aurene potentially flew south in cutscene.
---
Or in the outer space.
---
Yeah, I remember seeing a ton of this early on in LS1, with a few people speculating that Sylvari were secretly minions of the (yet unnamed) Jungle Dragon, and tons of people refuting it.  IIRC, there was also a forum thread around the time of the Tower of Nightmares, that pretty much exactly nailed how the season was gonna end, and most of the initial responses were very dismissive.
---
They removed the ability to place the first spot in midair. Using the second ability to go back to the first spot stayed available midair.
---
I noticed that you already changed the color of the legs in your second try, but a tip nonetheless.
---
The best way do deal with the "Toy-armor-looks" issue is that you shouldn't use pure colors when dealing with armor or leather.
---
If you check your dyes screen you can select armors by material and selecting the right materials helps a lot with that impression.
---
I have nothing to add to the leather part, but for the metal parts I would advise you to search for a metalic -extremely-light blue tint color.  
---
This way it will look blue in dark places and have that metal shine on the light. Adds a lot to realism.  
---
But never, ever, use the Pure Color dyes on armor. Specially in the RGB colors: it will make you look like a child toy.
---
&gt; A large enough part of the community
---
Large enough for what? With decades of data, the restaurant industry knows that each customer who bothers to leave a positive review represents 10x more people than a customer who leaves a negative review. I don't see any reason to believe that the anonymous whiners on reddit represent a different ratio of reality. Since so many people have taken complaining online as their only definition of their self, it's probably much higher.
---
So there's no confusion:
---
* the time gating on the skyscale is fine
---
* the hero point requirement for HoT elite specs never should have been reduced
---
* the nerf to &lt;insert favorite bullshit build here&gt; was deserved and appropriate
---
Go on Wiki and look at how much BS you still have after the eggs.
---
Yeah, and how do we know how long one year is in Tyria
---
Everyone holds their daggers backwards except maybe one or two dagger skins
---
Get an outfit and make warrior or rev. Mesmer is light armor and can wear robes anyway too
---
&gt;I hope s5 is gonna be the expac3 introduction season. Continuing gw2 on lws alone sounds too ristky and honestly quite boring as well.
---
I feel the same. PoF expansion brought me back. Expansions brought my friends back, not the Living World Seasons. Now my friends are slowly leaving, but asking when the next expansion will be.
---
In last guild chat anet spilled they dont even have the origins of elder dragons yet
---
Since you have no concrete numbers to confirm anything you're saying, I honestly don't see the reason you're being this pedantic about what OP said. Talk about literally everything else that was mentioned in the post instead of the small closing statement detail about how many people were/weren't actually upset about it...
---
Ecto has been below 20 silver for months now.
---
That was my understanding as well, but I suppose "under water" is another part of Tyria.
---
Wouldn't it have been fun if everyone who farmed istan was able to instantly buy everything from the next 5 maps, due to all the currency they'd accumulated while farming, leaving those zones a barren wasteland even at release.
---
huh what shrines?
---
Except it's almost impossible to acquire that outfit at the moment.
---
Exactly! They are only thinking of our safety while we run off to fight with sharp and exploding things!
---
And the Bladed armour without the bloody blades all over it.
---
If the only reason people are in the map is to farm the currency, buy the shit and leave, the map is not really good content.
---
There's more than one outfit that looks like it would fit into the light armor category.
---
It'd also make sense because it's no longer DSD-Kralk it's now DSD-Aurine and it would be incredibly easy for us to take a side in that battle.
---
No, it is the part after Skyscale Lost.
---
The reward tracks for each map and week get saved though, so it doesn't really matter whether you use 6 every day or 40 at once.
---
The difference between this and Mordremoth-Zhaitan is that we aren't just killing the dragon and leaving the other to freely feed on the magic. The whole plan was to replace the dragon with Aurene. So now the supposed link is Aurene-Steve.
---
Your position in the reward track gets saved so it doesn't really matter, as long as you use them in the most profitable weeks.
---
Like?
---
The solution is not to time gate one of the marquee features of a release.  You don't advertise something and then prevent players from obtaining it for a week to a month.  That's just stupid.  But that's our anet.
---
Mirage is the other elite spec (you might be thinking of Reaper which is an elite spec for the Necromancer) but yes, they're both a lot of fun to play.
---
Mesmer is the only light armor class that can use swords in both hands.  Warrior and Revenant can use 2 swords, but they're heavy armor and the outfits are good, but you lose a lot of the customization you get with skins.  
---
If you do want to use Warrior or Rev, the Honor of the Waves dungeon armor for heavy class is rather robe-like.  There are a few others out there you could work with, but light armor is definitely the robe centered armor class
---
I actually thought his last word after Mother was censored.
---
Well I feel like if tyria is destroyed without the dragons then they were birthed into existence when tyria came to be in the mists. Maybe the dragons are the infinity stones to our tyria gauntlet.
---
This gives me so much hope for Cantha even while knowing how unlikely it is because of the Chinese publishers (forgot name).
---
&gt; What are you, an art critic?
---
Close!
---
Also, fun fact: OP just [found out](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bqmsti/the_new_map_has_some_truly_beautiful_spots/eo8rj11/) s/he was editing under a screen-tinting app and achieved unintended results.
---
Sure, that would make many things easier. Maybe Anet pulls a surprise on us but I wouldnt count on it.
---
Or weaver, the pof ele elite spec
---
Do it.
---
I could see either making sense. Aurine now has all of Balthazar's magic and the Battle Isles was the headquarters of the Zaishen back in the day so there's a clear connection there. Cantha also makes sense because we're going to need more friendly dragons if we want to unseat the remaining Elder Dragons and Cantha had a few 250 years ago, like Kuunavang.  
---
The other thing to remember is that Aurine is prophetic so she may have a vision of where she needs to go/what she needs to do without having a reason that the commander (and thus the players) would initially understand.
---
This is the first time it has ever dropped.
---
Quick, panic-speculate-buy underwater precursors and swim speed infusions!
---
My information says those were also “shelved” with gw3.
---
Didn't they lose all the API data not long ago?
---
If it's just re-appeared in the API it's because someone dropped it, not necessarily because it's never been seen before in the API - someone could have dropped it before the API splat.
---
That was a while back. Back then, each lane counts as a separate event, so tagging all lanes meant more rewards. It's a very risky and short sighted strategy though; Multi-mapping, alt farming was far more profitable but those strategies did not become mainstream till months later. But this is all history, anet had since adjusted the system.
---
Alacrity is a good point.  For some reason I tend to forget about it.
---
You're focusing very much on a small portion, and ignoring other portions:
---
1. Just before discussing the mother line, Tom Abernathy talks about how they put little tidbits that won't be fulfilled for *years* from now. And the mother line seemed to be called out as one of these tidbits.
---
2. They said that it's important not to do world ending threat after world ending threat. This **heavily** implies that Season 5 will be a more "down to earth" threat level plot, and not an Elder Dragon.
---
&gt;If you go back and watch or play the instance, you can very obviously hear ocean waves after he dies: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frls5cHRkPU&amp;t=26m10s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frls5cHRkPU&amp;t=26m10s)
---
You do realize the next scene takes place on an ocean cliff, right? Also, when the water sounds get cut out is when Aurene changes the backdrop to Tarir, then the sounds (including seagulls!) re-appear when the Tarir backdrop fades away.
---
&gt; This is handy for casual players, because they feel that they can progress at the same rate as hardcore players without having the feeling that they're missing out. If they miss a day, then can just catch up on another day, and the amount of time required to unlock the rewards will move with the same amount of time. This solution is handy for casual players to still feel as rewarded as hardcore players.
---
That is not true unless you also have very consistent and specific amount of play time.
---
Time gating will also screw over the people who have varying amount of time per day. Lets says you have little time today but a lot of time tomorrow so you decide that you will try to get it done tomorrow but instead you just crash into a roadblock instead.
---
&gt; inside an area occupied by our unkown dragon.
---
He's not that close to Tyria and doesn't reign over the entire ocean.
---
There are manny things like that Anet over look on thief (maybe other classes too). Are they going to look at them? Maybe. Do they care? No. Unless everybody jumps on them for it and not pay them then they will take it seriously. My asura thief is a bit weird too especially with the dagger being too small to see and some of the medium armor gets glitched through each other.
---
Easy answer is to just make it all Chinese-inspired. This game isn’t released in Korea or Japan.
---
Woooooow
---
Been waiting for some kind of connection between Kralk and the DSD, since the dragons seem to come in pairs:
---
Zhaitan/Mordremoth: Death and Growth
---
Primordus/Jormag: Fire and Ice
---
Which leaves Kralkatorrik/Selbbub as a pair. Crystal and Water isn't quite as obvious a duality as the others, but it works. Solid/Liquid, crystals grow in water, etc.
---
What do you mean? He is clearly addressing all of us.
---
Hole heartily agreed, that mini dungeon was one of the best things on launch weekend
---
Aurene flew off into the sunset. Or maybe sunrise.
---
That means she flew east or west. Not south.
---
Here we will agree to disagree. Everybody remembers the griffon collection fondly for example and if you had the gold there was no timegate. 
---
I find the collections very fun. cheers
---
A lot of endgame content is split between the expansions and the living world content.
---
You can buy seasons 2-4 in the gem store for in-game gold (it's doable but will take a while) or cash. 
---
Season 1 is locked out for everyone who started after that point. Some of it is hinted at in game and a tiny amount was remade as dungeons, but it's basically gone. 
---
Season 2 has a good story, but not much more other than some gear and a few bits and bobs. There's a little cutscene that really, really quickly summarises Season 1, but it leaves you fairly clueless and Season 2's story takes over after the first chapter anyway.
---
Seasons 3 and 4 each give you a new map per episode and are very worthwhile. You definitely get more bang for your buck with 3 and 4.
---
pvp
---
VERY NICE WORK, I also like the blink shirt,music is spot on &lt;3
---
Plasma sword skin works too, not as thick as holosmith sword but it retracts like a lightsabre xD
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Plasma\_Sword\_Skin](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Plasma_Sword_Skin)
---
I'm calling it now, Kralk landed right on top of Bubbles and that's the ley energy node we've seen on that map in Tarir.
---
interesting, just checked, didn't realize holosmith one retracts aswell.
---
There were a lot of hints during season 1. There is basically no information about season 5 unless the community is super blind to it.
---
Didn't Joko in episode 3 says something about being there the Krak was born?
---
That...that makes a lot of sense, and is also just really cool.
---
I reccomend getting volcanus skin for your greatsword. Other then that sword id say your guy looks very much like ike! If you can get a red head band or back peice i think that would drive the colorscheme home :D
---
Well yeah, they have no free will once they're a minion, it doesn't mean a growing seed can't be freed from the corruption through love? There's no link between the two.
---
I mean, that's literally what happened. I don't know why we should try to retcon the official lore for some arbitrary reason you found in an interpretation of a theory about the ED.
---
We don't know anything about the ED and their corruption, it's all still extremely blurry. Let's just take the lore at face value.
---
Haha, we never got the Malyck's backstory, we obviously can't deduce anything from it. And even if we could, it doesn't change anything to what I just said. There's maybe tons of other way to purify a dragon minion, maybe Malyck's tree was nurtured too, maybe the forgotten brought it to the altar of Glaust, maybe something else, we don't know.
---
All we know is that the forgotten were never, ever mentioned in the Pale Tree origin, unlike the Tablet of Ventari which is very, very heavily tied to the Dream, and its shielding effect from Mordremoth.
---
Posts like this one is why I come here every day.
---
cultural appropriation.
---
&gt; I was exploring the map and ended up collecting the last egg the minute after reset, now I'm a day behind everyone else!
---
Nope. You're days ahead of me because I'm simply not going to do that bullshit, and there are plenty of people who only have a few hours per week that they can play at all.
---
A buddy of mine comes online most nights and we exclusively play WvW for about 2 hours. He has the raptor, the drunken rabbit and the warclaw. He has no plans to do any more PvE than that.
---
Yes and no to everything ...
---
This has got to be the most warped and bizarre story I've seen in any video game, and I've played some NES/SNES games back in the day with weird premises and rising action.
---
I personally think that’s why they were working on it. To get a better engine!
---
Did he?
---
I had no idea it existed, and was kinda perplexed back at PoF launch when everyone said it was their favorite environment in the expansion. Admittedly being "forced" into it was less than ideal, but at least the collection made me learn about its existence
---
I keep wanting to think this too, but the way they've been avoiding having any underwater content in recent maps gives me second thoughts. Dragonfall could have been a lot less awkward looking on the world map if they were willing to put us under the waves. The fixes to underwater skills may have just been some dev's personal project.
---
Thank you very much :)
---
I'm not quite sure if your title matches the point you try to make in your message. Additionally I personally believe you are not asking the right question by asking -how- someone has been affected by match manipulation. Instead I'd ask -if- someone has been affected by it and then follow it up by -how-. Otherwise you're going to create an echochamber of a post filled with people whom will agree with you. Which in all fairness, doesn't teach either of us anything. 
---
All this aside. I personally have not come across many match manipulators (60-100 games a season, so not much. Mostly around plat 1/2). The only examples I have come across are the 'Ah you were the (insert insult) guy from last game, you know what, glhf I hope you lose'. But even that does not happen often. This would be match manipulation. The other few examples I have come across are those that die repeatedly at the start, get frustrated and then choose to either afk, flame or both at the same time. I personally don't consider this to be match manipulation, but to be frustration. Which in my opinion deserves to be penalized to some extend. Although not the same as match manipulation, as match manipulation often tends to have a 'hidden agenda' (read: boost someone, lower someone or win tournament prizes).
---
I wholeheartedly believe that future story will delve more into the nature of magic and why it drives someone mad.
---
Magic is something that the devs have been focusing on awhile, and it's always been in the background. The anomalies, balance of magic, leylines, etc..
---
[The All](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_All) is something quite explicitly said to be something even the Elder Dragons have trouble understanding. It makes sense that when the story is done dealing with dragons, we may deal more with The All.
---
What I've found suspicious in literally every scene featuring Ogden Stonehealer post-2012 story was just how certain he was about various prophecies, and his level-headed about the whole elder dragon thing. Like he literally predicts that Aurene eats Joko, revives, and becomes an elder dragon. And he explicitly appears to know more about Tyria, the Mists, and The All, than even the Elder Dragons.
---
Take the Kralkatorrk situation. Everyone was panicking that it was the end of the world. Meanwhile Ogden was rushing us out of his office and all like "You're going to thunderhead keep!" without much of a reason why he is telling us that.  
---
The Dwarf knows something, and I think he may be involved with future story.

It’s a boring build.

Just walk. It will slowly reveal the map.

[ARENA NET] [Stephane Lo Presti.7258 posted on 2019-05-20 20:55:21](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/77191/an-update-about-the-skyscale-acquisition/p1#Item_0):
---
&gt; Hey everyone!
---
&gt;
---
&gt;First off, a huge thanks to the community for continuing to be one of the most supportive and positive game communities out there. The outpouring of goodwill we’ve seen you show toward each other in the new map has been outstanding. For the past few days we’ve been listening to what you have to say, and it’s been great to see all the positive feedback as well as the constructive criticism.
---
&gt;One of the most common concerns has been the amount of time gating in the journey to unlock the personal version of the skyscale mount. Since we began designing the skyscale, our goal was to deliver a story and experience that rivaled our other prestige mount, the griffon. Instead of putting a hard gold price on obtaining the mount, though, we instead looked at how we could preserve the feeling of investing time and effort in such a powerful mount, while lowering the barrier so more people could obtain the skyscale without breaking the bank. It would have been helpful to communicate our design goals for the mount’s acquisition clearly before the release of the episode.
---
&gt;The mastery track is not intended to block spirit shard acquisition, and we’ve hotfixed this. The goal moving forward is that locked masteries will not prevent EXP gain in the future, but a solution will take some time to implement.
---
&gt;For the skyscale in particular, the daily gates were designed for a couple of reasons, including the story—it doesn’t make sense for your skyscale to go from an egg to fully grown in a day. However, we recognize that there are stronger ways to create a sense of progression toward a reward. We’ll continue to learn from this as we develop future releases.
---
&gt;For now, we’ve made a couple of changes in areas where players were engaging in content with competing goals. In the May 28 update, we’ll reduce the time between collection tiers from 24 hours to 2 hours, to reflect the passage of a full day in Tyrian time rather than in real world time. You’ll also be able to feed your skyscale four times a day instead of three, reducing the total number of days you need to feed your skyscale by one (assuming you feed them the maximum amount each day).
---
&gt;We’re continuing to read, analyze, and discuss your feedback—please continue to post your thoughts in [this thread](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/76448/merged-about-the-skyscale-timegate#latest).
---
&gt;Thank you again for all the feedback and we’ll see you in game!
---
^(Beep boop bleep. I'm a bot. Message me or /u/Xyooz if you have any questions, suggestions or concerns.) [^Source ^Code](https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/docker-polarbytebot-gw2-submission-transcriber)
---
I do agree, but I think mounts ruin that idea going forward. It would probably just be invisible walls everywhere with someone eventually managing to break through.
---
Yes, it's worth getting into. We're expecting more free content/mini expansions but not a big one any time soon. 
---
Both Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire are very popular. If you can, get both. Due to the way levelling works and the well-designed zones, none of the expansion content is considered out of date. 
---
There is also Living World content, which are a series of mini-expansions that are free during release then can be bought (with cash or a modest about of ingame gold) after the next one comes out. *Most* Living World content is still pretty popular. Seasons 3 and 4 give you most bang for your buck, content-wise.
---
Well, support builds are never strong in solo instances/open world, and rule of thumb is power&gt;condi due to most things not having enough health for condis to ramp up, but my preference is still condi renegade for that. Not only is a lot of power renegade's dps locked behind a boon (quickness) you can't provide through your class (and sigils that give it don't give much), but I also feel a lot less survivable on power than I do condi.
---
I'm upset they are changing the time gates but glad they aren't removing them completely.
---
Too little too late, by the time this change gets put in we will all be done anyways
---
feeding will now take u 3 days instead of 4, not in game days - irl days
---
- And wold map blending into ocean, please.
---
- And armor collection, please.
---
- And Branded Spear backpack skin, please.
---
But there were also a bunch of wrong speculation threads, we just forgot those.
---
I personally am more annoyed by the quartz crystal timegate than the regular one. Putting players at such a massive disadvantage just for not hording a specific account bound AND timegated mat...
---
Regular materials would be fine, they can be farmed or bought, but I had 0 crystals, forcing me to basically wait an entire month if I were to build everything myself.
---
Will probably drop down in price in the long run, especially when halloween &amp; wintersday flood the market with charged quartz.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
Will probably still cost upwards of 30g though.
---
given my ex's name is Susan, this is awkward
---
does it make a difference? by the time the update rolls around, people who started the collections early will likely already have the mount. Unless the last collection is so time gated that it'll take more than 8 days... guess we'll find out in 3 hours.
---
I mean, the alternative is to not change it at all. Ideally they wouldn't make such mistakes in the first place, but shit happens.
---
They get it tommorow, not today.
---
There is also the fact that it is an insect. Some insects' entire life cycle could probably be covered in a single real time day(12 Tyrian days)
---
Something picked up on if you looks through this subs history, someone posted a picture of the some anet devs at a recent convention sporting guild wars shirts but with s blue logo. Continuing the trend of green for HoT, orange for PoF, and blue for whatever’s coming next.
---
&gt; yeah I highly agree with their philosophy that it would make no sense to hatch a egg within a day.
---
It also wouldn't make sense for your character to jump back into fight after getting killed.
---
Would you enjoy that for every character that gets downed, they get a 3 month recovery period in a tyrian hospital before you can use them again?
---
This is my prediction for season 5
---
[You're not the first one to guess](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3nl8nc/thanks_susan/cvp2b57/)
---
365 days with leap years that match ours.  The devs changed it from being slightly different to be matching ours back when they released the living story at every 2 weeks to a month.  They wanted every real world day to match the timing you would expect for the story
---
Maybe there is something interpreting "nobody joined this instance in a long time" as "it must be inactive"
---
&gt; If not for any other reason, because without a griffon, completing the first set of skyscale collections is like swallowing red hot thumbtacks while stepping on legos barefoot.
---
I am at the point where I am feeding the dragon. I actually kinda like finding ways around things in GW. But yeah since I am so close to the dragon and the griffon eats 200 gold, the griffon has to wait I think.
---
same. it's pretty boring waiting for the reset but it also does feel like a journey; I'm thankful that I got to spend 4 days with my skyscale hatchling and take care of it, for example. If I'd been able to do that all in one day, it'd feel like the hatchling was never even there.
---
There's so many things in the collection like this that actually made me like the skyscale process. These collections are shockingly well done and you unlock a few little things on the way (like a ball you can throw to your skyscale etc.) that add a bit more flavor to the whole thing. If they shorten the timegates just a bit so that the wait is only every few hours instead of every day, this collection would be perfect.
---
Some collection steps that would be tedious, difficult, slow, or expensive (or any combination of that) actually have alternate ways of doing them, like the skyscale of ice asking you to be frozen by Claw of Jormag. If you have season 3 unlocked, you can instead just go to bitterfrost and get frozen from the ice storms there.
---
And at no point do you have to fail an event to make progress \o/
---
Immersion is something personal. Nothing stops you from roleplaying those timegates for yourself. And there are immersive ways of explaining fast grow :)
---
Maybe it will learn people that those daily craftings are actually worth it to spend 10 seconds a day on.
---
If you could reset everything without using the security features you activated, it would be pretty shitty security. 
---
Just send in an anonymous ticket, with as much info as you have about your account, characters, if you have the product key etc to prove it's yours. The response is usually pretty fast. 
---
When you do get access and want to level up fresh, DONT DELETE YOUR OLD CHARACTERS. They have birthday gifts that get better with age and you will only regret deleting them (been there, done that).
---
I just got paid and I want to buy the dlc, but it's not on sale anymore, but other people say it still is. Is it actually half off still, or am I literally minutes late?
---
Call it elitism but I'm actually happy that as a player who sucked it up and was doing the collection since day1 I'll be able to ride it week earlier then somebody who didn't.
---
*puts on tinfoil hat* unless this was their plan all along
---
They can get it at the next reset, which is "today" for at least the players in America
---
I think that's totally acceptable.
---
I mean I won't, I just started today.
---
Any self obligation you create is on you. Dont punish others for your flawed mentality. The collections for skyscale are already long enough to make arbitrary timegates unnecessary.
---
Just make it impossible to use mounts until you've reach a point in the story or just lock them out.
---
If the level design is good, players will easily overlook this restriction.
---
The thing about the dragon is that while its a nice novelty, at best, you're getting springer 1.5.
---
Its not gonna let you accomplish much that you couldn't accomplish before. 
---
Its nice for flexing on people in lion's arch, but outside memes, don't expect to get a lot of functionallity out of it without a griffon to back it up.
---
Match manipulation is nowhere near as prevalent as posts like these try to make it out to be. Most people who bitch about it just straight up don't understand why games are won or lost. That also makes it harder to sift through all of the bullshit reports to find the actual manipulators. With that said, I don't think ArenaNet puts much effort into banning PvPers, typically. I mean, people are planning to sell #1 on the LB again, so that should tell you plenty about how likely people think it is that they'll be punished harshly.
---
Path of Fire is a small-group oriented expansion.  It offers some enormous maps, but size vs. population they can feel quiet at times.  
---
It feels a little weird going into Path of Fire without an existing elite specialization.  I wouldn't suggest using the level 80 booster.  Try and play through some of the core game which has a much more forgiving and exploration based than either HoT or PoF.  
---
Being familiar with your class is important when dealing with the expansion areas.  I'd say PoF is maybe a 2.5x jump in difficulty from core whereas HoT is something like a 4.0x jump in difficulty with regard to more dangerous enemies, and the need to understand how to offensively and defensively approach skirmishes with mobs.  Going into PoF/HoT with a weaker build and not knowing how to play your class won't be particularly fun.  The enemies use more CC, self-buff themselves or their allies and while PoF is generally light on champion class monsters compared to HoT (hero points, especially) it's still a jump in difficulty from the core game.
---
Well, at this moment it is too late for hotfixes, so they go with next regularly scheduled update next week. As always.
---
&gt; What we find at the end is the Eye of Janthir torturing Saul D'Alessio by immortalizing him... But for what purpose? To make him a puppet? For what? When did the White Mantle or Mursaat ever use Saul as a puppet?
---
You can find the answer back in GW1. Mursaat gave Saul some abilities, so he could defend Kryta against the Charr and form the White Mantle. After they won, Mursaat killed every White Mantle member, who had doubts. Saul was one of these people, but since he was the founder, the the leader of the White Mantle, they wanted to break him and make Saul a puppet.
---
So yes, they had reasons to use him as a puppet. 
---
Also the whole bastion was a prision, for other prisoners, but mainly for Saul. The Eye of Janthir were supposed to torture Saul until he obeys. From this and the fact that from Sauls point of view he made everything wrong in his life, it can be assumed that Deimes were created artifically/on purpose. 
---
Kralk's torment on the other hand wasn't caused by magic itself. Kralk's own magic was fine, it was nothing wrong and no torment there. His torment was caused by Zhaitan's, Mordremoth's and Balthazar's magic that he wasn't able to handle, even though he could use it. The world's magic balance were disturbed immensely and Kralk literaly couldn't carry that much "weight". 
---
Aurene on the other hand is a new, unique being and able to consume Kralk's magic as well as the magic of Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Balthazar without getting corrupted like Kralk. 
---
&gt; Some food for thought, but the player character being ascended (since LS2) may be a reason why we can consume so much unbound magic without being driven mad by it.
---
We got the ability to consume unbound magic from an antique artefact. You get it either by playing the first LS3 story or you have to buy it from a vendor. Without this artefact, you are not able to consume unbound magic. 
---
The ability to consume volatile magic was given us by aurene. It's the first mastery from LS4. "Aurene has gifted you the ability to harvest Volatile Magic, which would otherwise be hazardouz to touch. 
---
That's why we can consume unbound and volatile magic, while other creatures getting crazed. 
---
&gt; More food for thought: Is this mirror world what it means for the Mursaat to be "out of phase" with Tyria? And being ascended is why we can see and fight them?
---
The Ascension is the reason why we can fight them, since we get the Gift of True Sight, but there is no mirror world where Mursaat go, when the go out of phase. They just phasing between Tyria an the Mists, which means they just stay "in the door" between both. 
---
In the Canthan culture, becoming Weh no Su (-&gt; ascend) gives you the ability to see the spirits of the dead, even if they are hiding. That's why we are only able to see the Envoy after we became Weh no Su (after we ascended). In the story they helped us before, but our char wasn't able to notice. 
---
As fas as i can see, there is no hint of any Mirror World.
---
37% off on dlgamer
---
&gt; (Especially on quiet days when all you had to do was throw meat at it...)
---
That part isn't changing except going from 4 to 3 days
---
Haha, yeah. I'm passed these parts, but I agree with the "fixes" ANet is releasing, and think they've done well with the community. 
---
The egg hatching really isn't bad anyways. You just feed the thing and then play like you were before the skyscale was released.
---
Almost like it was on purpose.
---
I haven't even done the last living world stuff...
---
Is dlgamer a good site? I looked up some reviews, and it looked pretty split to me.
---
\&gt; Dont punish others for your flawed mentality. 
---
Do you think I'm an Anet developer? I'm not punishing anyone for anything. You asked why we like the time gate, and I answered.
---
Now you are just taking what I am saying way to literal. My response to what Anet stated in the meaning for the timegate.
---
I got my really first char to 80 by running dungeons over and over again. Returning to the game and I found that dungeons are pretty much ghost towns lol
---
Eh, still an improvement. ^^ b
---
The first scavenger hunt was close to alright. There were some hints that told you almost exactly where they were, and you just needed to look at the map or use your knowledge of the map to find them. Then the other two just gave up.
---
Call me old fashion but I don't care for daily chores in a game.
---
I've turned off all player chatter by this point. Which means I never heard the combat chatter from the newest specializations, and forgot they even would have them until I watched someone's video, but my sanity is worth it.
---
Skyscale devalued
---
That's my hope.
---
Those sound like some good changes, I'm glad to hear the time-gates have been reduced. The time-gates at the 'feed thrice daily' stage felt pretty stifling because once you've done the treat collection there's nothing more for the following days. Another option they could have pursued is splitting up the treats collection over several days to match the feeding requirements, and maybe add in some other chef foods to pad it out between each step.
---
In any case, I've really enjoyed the collection so far and will likely finish it before the update comes into effect, but it's nice to know others will have more control over their play time while doing this collection.
---
man why? The gate, while annoying, was not as bad as some other MMOs (WoW netherdrake for example). And there are ways to drop it down to 4-5 days....its.not.that.bad.
---
Im desperately looking for an answer though nobody seems capable of providing it. Thank you for your time :)
---
Asura male, if I remember right.
---
West of Kryta, across the Unending Ocean would be the [Sunken Islands and Sunrise Crest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=1b8HBUvsvV8), which we've never visited in the franchise, but GW: Utopia was speculated to be set there.
---
Not saying we'll go there NOW just because Aurene maybe flew in that direction. Just that those exist canonically.
---
I got a good laugh out of that. Just one of those great little details
---
You asked why someone would like timegates, so I gave you some reasons. You are not required to agree with those reasons, just like other people are not required to agree with your thought on those reasons. :)
---
Dont forget about the "deep dive" guild chat happening on the 24th.
---
these are great changes imo. Good job.
---
&gt; Rushing so many collections in one sitting would be rough.
---
Focusing on the griffin for a full weekend was exhausting, when I finally unlocked it on Sunday night, my feeling of satisfaction was immense. &gt;!(but I was broken inside)!&lt;
---
Yeah, but the dang thing could at least burp in our faces or something. Some interaction to mark the end of yet another day.
---
Every od these reasons can be achieves without punishing those not sharing your pov. Why you should be happy and I should not?
---
Realism should only be in games if it enchances the experience, not if it dimmishes it.
---
Scaling it back to just two hours is a good change imo. I'm glad Anet spoke out and chose to make the changes. Not a lot of game companies that I know of would do that, especially companies of MMORPGS.
---
Ah, right.
---
Thanks!
---
Really the only bad part of the skyscale release is the lack of communication beforehand. I think the collection and time gating behind it is fine, but they probably should have set expectations appropriately.
---
Hold up, are you saying Steve is a.... girl? Back to Bubbles then.
---
Not gonna lie I tried to press play on your flair.
---
&gt; if you listen to what's going on aurally
---
Aurally...? I was confused about what they meant here, so I looked it up and apparently it means "Relating to the sense of hearing."
---
I mean... how else are you gonna LISTEN to something?
---
Then buy the food straight up. There *are* options, its just people whine when they can't do the first one because they don't want to do daily crafting.
---
And so ArenaNet listens to the QQ'ers once again when they don't really need to nor should. Disappointment.
---
Nah, gotta ticket for the SMS stuff &gt;_&lt;
---
Yeah, we know the other elder dragons have/had it because of the undead destroyers that primordius has before we put him back to sleep.
---
\&gt; we instead looked at how we could preserve the feeling of investing time  and effort in such a powerful mount, while lowering the barrier so more  people could obtain the skyscale without breaking the bank 
---
I generally support this, but searching for 50 items on a map is so boring I'd rather pay the gold.
---
Good bot
---
the only novelity I use from time to time is endless miniature tonic, as for QoL i have all bags slots on my main, few shared inv slots, both salavage-o-matics and perma mistlock pass
---
Or, you know, because today's Monday.
---
But what if the reason he was so moody is that the people he bet with considered the first time a defeat? And now he's so deep in debt the Pale Tree couldn't dig him out and he's going to have to run from creditors for as long as he lives?
---
what about compensation to ppl who unlock it before 28th may? if it was my game and i fucked up, i would reward ppl for going through with frustrating game design
---
By removing demand
---
Considering how little gaming time I've got anymore, this is fantastic. I can't always do a full step to wait for the next day, so when it slows me down even more than I already feel, it sucks. Heck, finishing the story alone took me 5 ish days this patch. These are great fixes, thanks Anet.
---
I see no reason for group punishment for someone's flawed mentality
---
&gt; Well yeah, they have no free will once they're a minion, it doesn't mean a growing seed can't be freed from the corruption through love? There's no link between the two.
---
That seed will also have no will of its own, because it's a corrupted minion. There is a connection.
---
&gt; I mean, that's literally what happened.
---
Really? Says who?
---
Yes, Ventari and Ronan raised it, and taught it, but nothing says that gave it free will. You cannot give something free will just by talking to it, otherwise things like the Forgotten's ritual that gave Glint her free will back wouldn't have needed to exist.
---
&gt; We don't know anything about the ED and their corruption, it's all still extremely blurry. Let's just take the lore at face value.
---
You haven't been playing this game lately, I take it. We know a lot about the Elder Dragons' corruption and minions, and have since the personal story.
---
&gt; Haha, we never got the Malyck's backstory, we obviously can't deduce anything from it. 
---
We got enough. He's a sylvari born of another tree that was also a seed from the same cave as the Pale Tree, and he has free will and has no connection to the Dream.
---
&gt; All we know is that the forgotten were never, ever mentioned in the Pale Tree origin, unlike the Tablet of Ventari which is very, very heavily tied to the Dream, and its shielding effect from Mordremoth.
---
Nothing is mentioned of the Pale Tree's origins. We know nothing of that cave of seeds. And Ventari's tablet has no connection to the Dream at all. It's just a piece of stone with words carved into it. Nothing magical or metaphysical about it.
---
Why? Can you update me?
---
I'm fine with getting punished for lack of materials, as long as it's proportional. Losing an extra 2-3 days? I can live with that. ONE MONTH THOUGH?
---
same. i had no idea what i was doing and came out of it with some cool skins.
---
Indeed. Waiting for a reset makes people wait for reset to do things, even though it doesn't really make a difference. 
---
With 2 hours wait instead, you do what you can in the time you have to play, and while you are free do something else while waiting.
---
My friends and I actually play with the skyscale a lil longer than most players probably do…
---
To be honest, if you get it done in the next 8 days I would consider you part of the first wave. A lot of people have been working on this from the start, but didn't have the resources or the time to meet every reset deadline. Everyone who does it after this will have a much easier time of it.
---
"In the May 28 update, we’ll reduce the time between collection tiers from 24 hours to 2 hours, to reflect the passage of a full day in Tyrian time rather than in real world time." 
---
 Pretty sure somebody said this already but that's exactly the kind of reaction I was waiting. It's perfect. It fits with lore and it fits with confort. The kind of thing you want when you play a game. Some kind of limitation you don't really feel. I like them so much when they act like this. (-:
---
It's just we don't know what Blathazar absorbed.
---
This is great. Now I might actually pay and try to obtain it. Yay for whiners
---
There is more of those, for full list you can head to the wiki: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Server_reset
---
However the most important ones are Charged Quartz and then "Ectoplasm refinement" crafts like Lump of mithrillium  and such. You can just search for "ecto.." in crafting stations and it will show them in separate category.
---
Then, there are those growth lamps, heat stones, some food...in general those were mostly used in Mawdrey collection, and are probably still pretty profitable (due to the "once per day" characteristics).
---
The ecto refinements are especially important if you want to craft ascended equipment, or later on legendary one. It is pretty handy to have good stock of them, or turn them into carbonized ingots for good profit.
---
Keep in mind i said I think. I'm at work atm but I don't mind checking when I get home. Hell all I'm really logging in for is grinding out the danm skyscale timegate crap
---
If only gw2 had capes
---
&gt;It would have been helpful to communicate our design goals for the mount’s acquisition clearly before the release of the episode.
---
Since when was the skyscale a prestige mount? This is the first mention of that, right? I definitely think they missed the mark on communication with that, it may have tempered some expectations of having it on day one. The changes to the time gate sound a lot better though.
---
Fun fact that's how they thrive, and you're the person who should uninstall by the sounds of it. They do this constantly, they're all-inclusive to a fault, and that's not a bad thing, that is, until they include people like you.
---
Why the fuck would a company choose to limit their profits by any margin? If they include casual players they make more, it's simple logic and I'm baffled than you think it's "lowering the quality" of the game, when the game is mostly the same quality.
---
no, we're not getting an xpac between season 4 and 5
---
Lazy? It adds no amount of effort. It just adds waiting.
---
yeah I always make usre to atleast pet it after I finish feeding.
---
I'd say the opposite of lazy if they're ready to work on the collections more hours in a row than the game lets you. I don't see how waiting for a timer to reset makes you less lazy.
---
Except a day is only 2 hours long.
---
Yeah but at least Anet aren't charging you real-world money for that sense of pride.
---
Mellagan's MERCY, you are unpleasant!
---
Dragon story is not over. There are still 3 alive plus Aurene
---
Even if you dont buy the grow lamp thats still its value (changes over time) same with the food. Then there are the toys that you purchase, WP costs, time, and anything else in later collections that end up costing gold or have gold value. Plus even at a conservative 81g (not counting any other costs) that is "a good bit of gold".
---
I think the charged quartz crystals are still a bit too much, only be able to get one a day still makes it so u need 22 days if you don't want to spend gold to buy the food and the grow lamp.
---
What's the dofference, explain?
---
I like the idea of keeping Dailies real-world dailies and all the time gated stuff on Tyrian time.
---
2 hours is plenty of time to take a break and come back to it later in the day if you're up for an extra session later in the day.  This is a great compromise.
---
If you just consider it to be a branded look, it works fine for any class.   
---
Also goes well with the new Branded weapons (which btw have a thick trail that gives your spells a branded tinge)   
---
[Look at my take on it](https://i.gyazo.com/465897deb96ebe8df2c500f287b14bd4.mp4)
---
The adult life of a Mayfly is between 1 day and mere minutes depending on the specific species. That is Adult life though, but they spend about a year of time in their younger forms before they reach that point. Then they all mature at the same time and create some of the largest swarms of insects ever to exist which sometimes register as storms on the Doppler radar.
---
80 gold if you want to skip jumping puzzles and events. But the option to also pay 0 at that part is also there.
---
So because someone is capable of enjoying something you dislike, their mentality is flawed? All I've been trying to tell you is why someone might enjoy the desicions the devs have made.
---
&gt; For the skyscale in particular, the daily gates were designed for a couple of reasons, including the story—it doesn’t make sense for your skyscale to go from an egg to fully grown in a day. 
---
This seems like a weak argument to me, how does it make much more sense for it to go from an egg to fully grown in 8 days?
---
:O That was my exact suggestion! What a coincidence.
---
If you would actually pay attention to what I've been saying the entire time, you would know that I've not been trying to justify why the timegates were added. All I've been trying to tell you is why people who aren't you might be enjoying them.
---
Did they try to protect the meta like in DS by closing the map?
---
I mean can you join at the crystal stage of the meta.
---
&gt;  Of course demand will have waned down by then anyway as all the hardcore rushers bought what they needed already.
---
Even people who play once a week would have enough charged quartz by the time Halloween rolls around
---
Daily crafts you should probably care about because it's likely you'll need them at some point:
---
* [Lump of Mithrillium](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lump_of_Mithrillium)
---
* [Glob of Elder Spirit Residue](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glob_of_Elder_Spirit_Residue)
---
* [Spool of Silk Weaving Thread](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spool_of_Silk_Weaving_Thread)
---
* [Spool of Thick Elonian Cord](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spool_of_Thick_Elonian_Cord)
---
* [Charged Quartz Crystal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charged_Quartz_Crystal)
---
why not complete the meta and progress to the 25 meta achiev and get 1-4 bridges always after it. 
---
Worked for me :D
---
There is a Battle Royale game mode believe it or not...
---
okay, so at least checked gw2 for anything else that might have been bound to "W" and really nothing is, other then a PvP bind which i unbound, but i just moved all keys over and it is only on "W" that this issue occurs, and i bought a new keyboard and mouse and it still occurs, not sure if it win 10 oriented, which i would think is kinda wierd
---
&gt; To be honest, for me and many others, the charged quartz crystals aren't worth the daily craft.
---
even before this they were worth a little shy of 1g each in manufacturing leyline tools.
---
&gt;Same for all the other daily time-gated refinement though. Not a matter of time, a matter of giving up the raw material. E.g. I use mithril ingots for a lot more than I use deldrimor steel ingots.
---
this is a terrible way of looking at it. if you need more mithril, sell a deldrimor steel ingot and buy some. except for glob of elder spirit residue all the basic daily crafting stuff are a significant profit. make it,  sell it, buy more of the ingredients than you had in the first place.
---
&gt;No, that's the wait time between collection unlocks (the "wait for gorrik to tell you you can progress" ones)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Feeding will still take 3 real days
---
I think what they're saying it'll reflect Tyrian day-night cycle now instead of IRL reset :) It'll be "Tyrian day" that we have to wait now.
---
Don't expect them to pay attention to anything that's said to them that they don't/won't comprehend. Quoting another person;
---
&gt; It's like talking to a brick wall. You're not looking for an answer. Your'e looking to berate people who don't agree with you.
---
Tease me and deny mounts in a map of LWS4? 
---
Never ever gonna overlook this
---
Discovered it today, actually kind of liked it myself! The imps and oozes of the ice room are downright rude and  prevent you mounting for roughly about two eons but exploring was otherwise pretty fun. Might go back later and finish up those dwarf weapon collections too.
---
Well then, I cant deny you your personal opinions.  I can judge them however after you present them directly. Your point of view is selfish and skyscale collection in its current form is against gw2 philosophy.
---
Getting it first is enough compensation, lmao.
---
&gt; Maybe it will learn people 
---
Teach\*
---
I'm using Win 10 and I don't have that problem. It has to be a program (not GW2) that is stealing focus. Discord overlay, or any other chat programs/overlays running? Try shutting down every other program currently running. Open task manager and kill any process that is not a required System function, or GW2 itself. See if the problem persists.
---
A lot of people have dynamic ips. You just have to save each one as you come across it for verification. I have about 6 and it took a year to hit them all, but now I don't ever have to verify at home. Trying to reset your ip sounds like a lot of work that you really don't need to do.
---
The return of the fall* of the exit market
---
The Charged Quartz is still a problem, tho...
---
I think it was simple to do this in GW1 with the limited movement and zeitgeist of the time. But by todays Gw2 it will be hard and troublesome
---
I dont really think most people care about if its making sense or not. The trees we chop down are back a few hours later again, arguing with "it makes no sense" is a pretty poor excuse. The only reason timegated content exists is to make less content look like more content.
---
Our compensation is having the mount up to a week before this patch hits. There's no need for any other bonuses.
---
Can you remind me when I said they should keep the timegate?
---
I feel they needed to hold to there guns on this one.
---
Instent gratification is fine just as realism and working for an accomplishment is fine. The reason you don't have toons needing to be in hospital for 6 months after taking an arrow is the same reason you don't spawn in a broken down tank in a WWII game for a core machanic it would be unreasonable.
---
For something that is a one off, getting a legendary or mount there is no need to have Instent gratification and can be extended out over a period of time providing some realism and sence of long term progression and accomplishment.
---
This is not a place for contacting support,go read sub rules. Good luck in your future adventures.
---
I don't see any mithril in the shopping list for Nevermore but even if it did require that it would still make more sense than the above since a lot of the legendary precursor crafting process is essentially paying for crafting lessons
---
Pardon me for sounding like a dick, but having the DSD be Kralk's mother has to be one of the dumbest fan theories i've ever heard lmao
---
There are 6 known elder dragon each controlling a different spectrum of magic natively (i.e. regardless of the magic collected from other dead dragons).  And if EDs can't corrupt other EDs' minion, then it stands to reason that they're also probably not directly related to eachother either lol
---
Negative feelings are known to produce demons in the mists.  That much is true as far as we know. 
---
And magic does contain memories and feelings and records of past events that had a strong emotional impact. The VOED and related devices worked thanks to this principle.  
---
But for this case, I wouldn't say this was caused by demons specifically, just by a similar process to the one that creates demons.  
---
When it comes to Bloodstone frenzied creatures, I suspect it isn't something compelling them to act evil like a demon, but that the magic they were exposed to contained 'fragments' of  memories and feelings, and the hunger for magic they develop is caused by that magic wanting to be whole again. Magic would usually flow whole, like water in a river.  But within these blood crazer creatures it's more as if the water of that river was frozen and someone came with an ice saw and carried chucks of the river away.  
---
The more magic these people, the more they can reconstruct fractured memories and feelings and that dulls the pain a bit. But any new magic they get will also come with more fragments, and so their hunger only grows.   
---
Why won't ambient magic cause people to act like that?  
---
Because the concentration of ambient magic was way too thin to start having this effect.  
---
It wasn't until the Commander got to Bloodstone Fen that he begun noticing this effect, seeing shadowy hallucinations until he used the Shadowstone to fix the problem. The concentration of ambient magic in Bloodstone fen is so huge it aggregates in the form or orbs of Unbound magic all over the map, and across the world the concentration increased because all of the released magics.  
---
Why wasn't more people affected?  
---
Because they were not going around gathering these orbs like the Commander was. The more he gathered the more memories of past events started to get pieced together within the 'internal realm' of the Commander, and that caused pieces of the past to flash as shadowy figures.
---
With elder dragons, they also seem to be able to use any structure magic they consume, like spells and curses, or the ability to make mists portals. So any memories and feelings within them would not be just 'fragments' compelling to get more, they'd also be forced to relive the memories and feelings in the magic. The effect would be much stronger in them not just because of the amounts of magic they gather, but because their bodies are much more attuned to the magic.     
---
The more magic they take that was once within a living creature, and the more they corrupt the living to make minions, the more suffering they get in the magic they consume, and the more they are affected by it until all this torment drives them mad, and the more they are compelled to kill everyone to stop it so they stop getting all these memories and feelings with the magic they absorb. 
---
Why wasn't Aurene as affected even after getting most of the magic from 3 elder dragons, and quite a bit of magic from other 2 converted into god magic?  
---
Because her connection to Caithe and the Commander.  
---
Dragons may not be equipped to cope with all these memories and feelings, but mortals are.  By being connected to a mortal, cared by another, and growing up with them and their friends, she developed the mental capacity to cope with all those memories and suffering, and through her training and upbringing sharing magic with the commander, and the commander sharing bonds with his mounts, Aurene gained the ability to share the magic with all living things in a similar way, keeping it flowing without becoming stagnant and fragmented. All these fragments of memories would be able to come together more easily if they keep flowing, between the life in Tyria, the magical leyline system and friendly magical entities like Aurene, so eventually the system would stabilize without hurting any part of it.
---
You can feed your dragon 4 times per day instead of the current 3 times. They are talking actual days here.
---
Crossover with Metroid's Mother Brain confirmed!
---
salvage ectoplasm
---
Yeah... I kind of wish I could do more. Gotta greet it with a pet. Then help it build up an appetite with some ball. Feed it. Then it's bath time. And lastly don't forget to playit some lullabies on the flute. Gonna have the happiest, strongest skyscale! Lol
---
I question the accuracy of that number.
---
Great solution while keeping the RPG elements of the collection. Good job Anet :)
---
I think their reasoning was in the right place tbh. Instead of a gold gate, a time gate. They probably saw that not a lot of ppl owned the griffon the following months after the release. They also implemented the time gates to create a sense of evolution.
---
I think catering too much for casuals was one of the reasons for this. 250G in these days is really easy .. really easy to obtain. But is a gold gate any better than a time gate? A time gate at least is backed up by lore. Spending gold in random items to somehow allowing you to ride a griffon ?? 
---
Ultimately, I don't mind too much, I'm oldschool, a bit of grind, a bit of time gates, I'm cool with that. I have the griffon, is better anyways. Nice they recuded the time, but I fear they will keep responding to these demands and find themselves stuck at designing hard and engaging content. 
---
XP grind at HoT, cut. Meta timers and meta oriented maps, cut. Too difficult story steps? Cut. Now you insta respawn and/or enemies deal no damage. 
---
What has this lead to? Unrewarding maps, that are finished in couple of hours (not the case of Dragonfall, the meta is awesome), mastery tracks that are a joke (30 mins play yey), content that gets beaten in 2 hours, etc. 
---
Ultimately, as I've said in another post in the past, there is a thing called **too much convenience** and we're starting to feel it affecting way too hard progression and meaningfullness behind this game. I agree time gates are not the best option, but it is unreasonable they release a full story quest or whatever your suggestion is to replace this.
---
It still looks weird. I think they need to blend the blue colors of the map with the surrounding ocean.
---
Honestly, I hate this woman's canned corporate responses and miss Gaile. 
---
Also, her not subtle "you will not dissent or be banned" can go fuck itself.
---
As someone who hasn’t gotten a single spirit shard since they added them because I’ve been level locked because I’ve been too lazy to do the ridiculous grinding needed for the last few mastery points in each of the three areas... I’m happy that now I can’t finally get some freaking spirit shards yet I’m kind of disappointed on all the ones missed for these past few years....
---
No.
---
And once again... cry loud enough and anet hears you :/
---
I'm broke :D
---
These kind of super simple questions are more easily answered by using the wiki: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page
---
You can even access any specific wiki article from in-game, by using the /wiki command. To do so, in your chat window, type: "/wiki keyword", replacing "keyword" with whatever you are interested in. For example, to find out the answer to your question here, you could have instantly gotten the information by typing: /wiki crystalline dust
---
I almost waited for the DSD to pop up and freak out about the insane amount of magic we just dumped into the ocean. I wouldnt be mad about a break from killing dragons though. Lets have some regular evil dudes for a bit.
---
Too little, too late for some. Today is last day for feeding if you did collection from start. Should just have been this way from the beginning. Be thankful, ye players who did/will not have to suffer through the bullshit collections, go fetch quests, etc. If something is seen as a chore to do within what is supposed to be a game played for fun, something was done wrong. I earned my Skyscale the hard way, so I have bragging rights I suppose, but that's it. No compensation for those who have already jumped after Anet said to.
---
You sound guilty my dude.. just reroll and stop being sketchy.
---
This happens when animations are shared between skill effects of different weapons.
---
When that animation is used with a sword or axe skill, it'll look right.
---
Are you on maxed out settings for everything, or do you have some things tuned down?  Running everything capped out on a 1080 TI (same resolution) I'm seeing 35-70 FPS in towns, depending on which direction I'm facing.
---
But, my GPU usage caps out around 60-65% during those times.
---
Raids boss :p
---
The Guild Chat teased and hinted a bunch of stuff. Some others that I recall is mentioning Aurene's voice actress and how much they plan to work with her; also that originally she wasn't going to speak until she became an Elder Dragon. From what was actually said, it strongly implied Aurene wasn't gone from the story and that we'd communicate with her again.
---
There was also the line of "no dragon is meant to have that much power" or something like that they brought up and they hinted that while the magics may not conflict within Aurene, it still may be too much magic. There was also mention that she may be the first dragon born from an egg to ascend to an Elder Dragon and that while she does have a lot of power, she may not be the strongest, in which case the strongest would likely go after her.
---
There was some other stuff aside from that, but the observation of ocean waves is interesting. I did find a bit strange that every Elder Dragon we've known of is male. So if Bubbles is female and perhaps the mother of some of the other Elder Dragons, in whatever sense that means since they may not have been "born", that would make sense. And if Bubbles is that senior among the Elder Dragons, she could be the strongest of them, and stronger of Aurene. Though that would also mean that Bubbles is Aurene's great-grandmother...
---
Another point that is a bit off topic is Dragon Madness. It was definitely worsened due to our actions with the slain dragons, but it was suggested to have occurred before then; which is why it blinded Kralk to kill Glint (e.g. that which he loved, also covered in Guild Chat). But one thing mentioned in PoF is that Kormir failed to absorb Abbadon's power in time and that event is what awakened the Elder Dragons to start the current cycle. So if Abbadon's magic leaked into the dragons similar to how Mordremoth and the other magics did, that could explain a bit of the madness pre-GW2. But E6 also implied that Dragon and God magic is the same thing (e.g. why the Underworld was a familiar place since it is Death Magic just like Zhaitan). And Abbadon is the God of Water and Secerts, so if his domain is Water and Bubble's domain is Water, she wouldn't be maddened by that event like the others. Perhaps instead of trying to kill Aurene, Bubbles would be aware enough to try to corrupt her great-granddaughter into her way of thinking instead.
---
The map closes at some point, pretty sure it's at the weak spot stage.
---
Thread removed: Do not use this subreddit to try and contact the customer support.
---
Air and water, I think. Kralk’s secondary “thing” was air, right?
---
Like -
---
Zhaitan: Death and Shadow
---
Mordremoth: Life and Mind
---
Kralkatorrik: Crystal and Air
---
Primordus: Fire and ? (Maybe earth?)
---
Jormag: Ice and ? (Possibly lies/manipulation
---
DSD: Water and ? (Popular theory is fear or illusions due to lack of info)
---
I found myself just travelling to the map for the vendors and seeing the meta at the three bosses phase more than once.
---
OH WORD?
---
And you clearly think a bunch of people with no clout at Anet can sort this for you. I don't get these "I was banned for no reason" or "I can't recover my account posts" as if we can do anything if you have a problem go to Anet. Sorry to sound harsh but its a fact your wasting your time posting here.
---
we still get to play the same character, but in a different role. just as we do in open world, raids ,fractals.
---
The commander doesnt simply disappears ,nor does the pact, or the elder dragons. They all exist, just as jory and kass exist even tho we dont actually see them in the last few episode that much.
---
I dont get it, why do you think if anet decides to make a new protagonist to play with in s5, that all our other characters get locked up?
---
Steve (Stephanie?) was very comfortable with the magic in the ocean till Dragonfall happened.
---
Haven't played since a few months after HoT released and im considering getting back into this, am I going to need the latest expansion to do any relevant content? I'm not really bothered about story at all either, if thats all the expansion really brings.
---
Yeah there are some things that don't really add up for me in the story. The "Oh, but he was actually good!" just came entirely out of nowhere, especially with the lead up of Glint, who was there for the last rising of the Elder Dragons, putting him as this bad guy who gave zero shits about anyone else in the world.  We're supposed to just accept that "He was actually a good guy that only went crazy after he absorbed Zhaitan/Mordie/Balthazar magic"?
---
The biggest impediment for me is the fact that I've played about 4 hours of the map and have only seen 2 skyscale scales, even while actively exploring. I am turned off by the idea of having to hit up the wiki to visit 20 places to hit F. They are simply too well hidden to discover in natural play.
---
I think many people went in with a mindset of getting it within a day. I too wanted to get it before my guild raid night thursday and boy I was wrong about the length.
---
Wait, I'm confused. Isn't that a good thing? It'd be worse if they didn't listen and did nothing, right?
---
Personally, I am more annoying by the collection itself, mainly the first 3, than I was the timegate but I do appreciate Anet's changes and communication here.
---
Just rewatched it and it looks like she starts to level out a bit when the bright flash of light shows, but given the angle it still looks to me like she was heading for the water off in the distance.
---
Entirely possible that the flash of light preventing to see if she finished leveling out or not is intentional for speculation, but I’m probably wrong.
---
Wait, what? Was the map going to be bigger or is that just new map art? Although I hope we get more ocean maps, and if we get some that connect to dragonfall (at least in art if not a portal), it would be cool to see more random bits of land. Possibly the DSD’s minions feeding on chunks of god magic and ley lines made to flow more wildly and easily accessible
---
As soon as I saw the Oakheart combined with the waypoint prompt, my stomach dropped
---
Ahaha, get over yourself.
---
Makes me think that during previous Dragon cycle Zaithan somewhat fell asleep while flying mid-air and ended up creating Orr peninsula when he crashed in the sea...
---
I am looking for people who experienced similar situations and how they dealt with it. I‘m looking for advice on what I should do because I feel mistreated.
---
yes, and the commander can do them in the background while the players get to play other new things.
---
We played as mercenaries in raids, and the hot raid "story" catched up with s3 white mantle story where the commander was all along. 
---
Im not saying suddenly, elder dragons dont exist, or the commander disappeared together with the pact and the army that followed him/her, and we only focus on something new (like cantha which i guess is the first thing to come to mind to most of us here). 
---
gw1 and gw2 did these kind of things before tho on a smaller scale, while still focusing on the commander as the primary story line (expansion and LW story). 
---
So its not really that hard to imagine they can go this route. 
---
Will they? Who knows, probably not, still an interesting thing to think about at least
---
Adult Silkworms (the moths) don't even have mouths. They try to breed, then starve. Ins3cts are weird.
---
When they were first revealed, how were they actually blocking you from accessing the unrevealed parts?
---
Vines or sandstorms or what?
---
A little less rectangular and more blending in the blue would be enough.
---
Good post. Since mirror world is referred numerous times, it made me think of.. Lyssa's mirror. Dual faced goddess. Just spiralling deeper into crazy theories. :P
---
Hey at least they seem to be listening.
---
Ah, French language base. Corrected. 
---
Does not change sentiment though.
---
That's nice.
---
It's actually a bigger nerf than I would've expected.
---
Well in lore their response is "Commander Schmander, you are still a shitty weaponsmith so start practicing if you want to make your fancy sparkly weapon...scrub"
---
I know what they are, I just wanted to know if they were any fun to play.
---
&gt;Just spiralling deeper into ~~crazy theories. ~~ chaos
---
Fixed it for Lyssa.
---
There are quite a lot in a small area north in crystal oasis. West of the desert highlands entrance. East of the quicksand with skimmers.
---
A bit of everything aside from WvW really, I think I was mostly just doing fractals and open world content before I stopped playing.
---
You lack game experience because you boosted your character and went straight into HoT which isnt very beginner friendly. 
---
You're probably using gear from booster which is focused too much on defense, making you deal no damage, but still dying because gw2 combat is more based on active defense than face tanking.
---
My guess is that you're probably using random build (again, from boosting) which doesnt have any synergy with itself.
---
If last 2 were true, check some guides and builds, [metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:How_to_Gear_a_Character) has both. If not, just practice a bit in core Tyria lv80 maps.
---
For some reason, Omadd's machine had the Pale Tree at the center of the six elder dragons. Could she be Mother, somehow? We know she's a 'purified' blighting tree, but what if the purification actually attracted some deity-level being into the tree and it's this deity that we know as the Pale Tree? After all, no other blighting trees show any sentience.
---
Welcome :) enjoy tyria while you can, huehuehue
---
For Healer Rev, you could do Magi, or you could also do Marshal (Power/Healing main, Prec/Condi minor) since there actually some relatively cheap exotic marshal's armor on the TP you could use.  But if you're talking about crafting full Ascended gear for fractals, you should make full Harrier instead.  In fractals, you're taking the spot of a Druid who supplies Might to the party (as well as Fury), so you're gonna need to be using Heroic Command (F2) off-cooldown to give the party Might (and probably some fire-blasting too).  Chrono's are always in competent T4 groups, so ideally you really shouldn't need to be using your F4 anyways except as backup.  
---
For Condi Renegade, just check snowcrows.com
---
The hard way?  How was it hard?  How is it going to be easier to people after the changes?  Have you read what they are changing--I imagine not.  This sounds like a knee-jerk reaction without even looking into what you're upset about.
---
The amount of time you have to wait between Collections to unlock (after you finish them,) is shrinking from 24 hours to 2 hours.
---
The amount of food you can feed your Skyscale hatchling per day is going up from 3 to 4.  You still have to wait 24 hours to feed it 4 the next day.  This concludes in saving 24 hour period of waiting.
---
TLDR; they only reduced the amount of time you had to wait.  They did not remove any of the collections or what you had to do.  It is exactly the same.
---
PoF added a lot of useful elite specs (renegade, weaver, firebrand, soulbeast, holosmith, or deadeye for [fractals](https://discretize.eu/builds)) so you'll probably want it for that alone at higher tiers. There are 2 (3rd soon) raids for PoF as well on top of the 4 already in HoT. I'd suggest looking at [meta raid builds](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) to see what you're interested in playing (note that mirage doesn't have a benchmark due to it stacking confusion) or check the link for fractals above. The other major thing with PoF is of course mounts which are incredibly useful in open world for getting around. You can see some of the changes in the time since you left [here](http://www.nojamtoday.com/upload/guild_wars_2_content_and_feature_update_chart_290.png) (chart is over a year old now and doesn't have changes after PoF including the 2 new mounts and season 4).
---
Silverwastes had vines, some gates and the skritt tunels were closed.
---
Dry Top had a cave-in to access further parts and then a vine bridge grew later.
---
&gt;mordrem snipers are high dps but squishy af,
---
This is completely incorrect.  Normal Mordrem enemies do not have any more or less health than eachother.  They all have the same amount of health and take the same amount of damage to kill.
---
So glad i finished this Mini Dungeon when PoF first came out, and get all the Dwarven Weapons. The other achievements in there though...
---
Why voicing an opinion or concern must always be assimilated to "crying". Is it so much to ask that you consider it as what it is, people giving their thoughts on the topic?
---
Personally I think Steve (the deep sea dragon) is not going to appear anytime soon.  
---
I think if the writers wanted to use Steve, they would have introduced the character a lot sooner.  For example, Zaitan, Primordus and Kralk have been on the player character’s radar since day 1.  Since Steve hasn’t really been mentioned in the story, I think the writers are saving the character for a future storyline or a future plot twist.  
---
In theory, the Elder Dragons storyline is wrapped up for the time being since Kralk is dead and the other two are out of commission.  With Steve being largely untouched, they could return to the Elder Dragons story at any point in time.  They could easily do a “return of the Elder Dragons” storyline by having Steve eat a major city.  
---
That being said, I think Season 5 needs to focus on something not affiliated with the Elder Dragons.  I think if Season 5 immediately focused on Steve eating a major city, it would be repeating the storylines from Season 4.  I think Season 5 needs to serve as an epilogue to Season 4 as well as introduce a new major villain that has nothing to do with the Elder Dragons.  In a previous thread, I proposed the idea of having a 5 year time skip where the Commander has to come out of retirement to battle a new enemy.
---
This is probably the best way right now. Ectos are tanking in price because the new living world map poops them out like crazy. Crystalline dust is probably also falling in price because it can be salvaged from Ectos. Just buy ectos or scrounge up a bunch of rare gear and salvage away.
---
Just use black lion salvage kits on them.  I also like to use the skin until ive crafted the next tier, to add to the sense of my journey.  As others have said, salvaging your old precursors used to be a requirement for all legendaries, but they changed the system a bit for the second wave of them.  Stuff like Meteorlogicus still works like that
---
Definitely having trouble with completing the Path Of Fire storyline so will surely have a look into my gear (Which was obtained from the boost), Thanks for the response and information,
---
Great work. So cool ^_^
---
because people will always belittle those of a different opinion simply because they hold a different opinion. not much use trying to waste time arguing against ignorance, it's usually accompanied by stubbornness too.
---
&gt;don't try to run past mobs, they'll CC you to death.
---
What are you even talking about?  You should be running past the majority of mobs because they only get in your way lmao
---
I've used a heal scrapper with lots of barrier application. Alchemy/Inventions/Scrapper. Minstrel gear and antitoxin runes.
---
I was under the impression that Kralk consumed all of it because he was the only dragon in the vicinity upon his death and was able to soak up most if not all of it but that's just an assumption and definitely not something we know for sure.
---
Nice theory but what i don't buy about the whole "Kralk is a misunderstood grandfather buddy that is fighting his inner demons after absorbing magic from Zaithan, Mordremoth and Balthazar"-Story is the fact that he woke up from it's slumber and went on a killing spree before all that happened. Maybe it's just me but back in the day when Anet stated that Elder Dragons are a force of nature without a personal motive other than wiping out everything and going back to sleep i liked the story better than whatever they are trying to tell us now.
---
Good news is the next step will unlock 2 hours after the final feeding it seems and then the final collection two hours after completing that tier.
---
Not really crafting.  You shove quartz in a channel hp and then throw it in the forge.  You don't need actual crafting skills
---
\&gt;and they have a massive 3 second knockdown.   
---
I have literally never been KD'd by a smokescale.  What...???
---
Yeah I did read it, and I could have done every collection from start to finish in 3 hours, tops. Instead, because of said time gates, like you said, I had to wait at certain spots longer from collection to collection. I would have preferred to get it all done at once but couldnt and because of that, instead of doing my normal fracs for the night, or what I actually would prefer to be having fun doing, I had to do the collections with my time for the evening.
---
i watched that movie at an age where i didn't hate things if they differed from the source material at a noticeably lower quality (looking at you GoT season 5 to 8) but that movie did not compare at all to the books.
---
It's all about CPU.

Chronomancer is arguably the best offensive shield-user.

&gt; Why does it have to involve forced hours of downtime,

---
&gt; For the skyscale in particular, the daily gates were designed for a couple of reasons, including the story—it doesn’t make sense for your skyscale to go from an egg to fully grown in a day
