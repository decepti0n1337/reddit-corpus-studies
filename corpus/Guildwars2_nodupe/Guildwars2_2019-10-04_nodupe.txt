Chilling and just engaging in conversation has led me to some of the best moments I have ever had.

---
Literally had a "devil Charr" hovering over my shoulder whispering things when at some point an "angel Charr" started whispering in my other ear. All while holding conversations with random people and how I treat the conversations and people depending on who whispering what I'm my ears.
---
Damn good time and many others!
---
Alright, just reply with anger and abandon rational discussion, if that's what you want to do then?
---
I disagree, it is a basic feature that should have been in the base game from the get.  You can do it in other MMOs like WoW and GW1.  Somebody made an addon that filled the gap and rather than implementing a proper version (when they finally got around to it) that would make the addon obsolete they added a neutered pay per slot version.    
---
It's embarrassing and I do find all the people defending this move kind of amusing.

I see you don't understand the value of analogies, that's okay. I forgive you.

Oh yes, seems like the community is so much better now...

What I did not want though, "bro", is them selling those skins for about as much as the expansion itself. Or lootboxes

You're correct in pointing out that Trump's behaviour tends to make people lose focus of the work his administrative body is doing, which is more consequential in the long run than most of what he does on his own. And naturally that's true not just for him but for many heads of state, who ultimately are just that, the spokesperson for the executive.
---
Having said that: no, I don't think Trump is alot better than Bush or Obama, nor would I say his administration is. I also don't think this is the place to have that discussion
---
My preference would be that "Build loadouts", to use the same terminology, would be free, but tied to character progression. I think it could potentially be an awesome example of horizontal progression that is supposed to be fundamental to the core game philosophies.
---
Gear loadouts absolutely make sense to be monetized and I don't disagree on that point. However, I do see why some folks are upset when they had the arcdps method.
---
Parallel to this, there is also the concern over the maximum limit, which I think is valid. I'm not sure why there *is* a maximum limit in the first place, and I suspect it is rooted in some difficulty within the code. Another possibility is that having a "limit" promotes the psychology of "maxing it out" and completing it.

&gt;Changing builds takes like 30 seconds tops.

(X) doubt.

Maybe if you have the entirety of the builds for that class memorized by heart and your inventory is completely organized to a T. Getting all the skills, gear, and traits set up is a lot of work if you multiclass and don't keep a log of every potential build.

---
With DPS meter you will need to pay for slots you can see, free will be 5 for party content, and you need to buy the others from there xD Up to 50
---
&gt; Which is where Arenanets templates come into play, because the changes that you make while playing change the template you are currently using too, which is complete shit, there SHOULD be something like a button to update the template you are you want with the setup that you are currently using, this is super flawed.
---
Wait what? Really. Thats bizarre, why would they implement it like this? Its clearly not how these templates should work. And like a poster below said this effectively means there is 1 less template than is apparent.
---
As for it being unspoken thats because this is the sort of thing that only really becomes obvious once you actually start using it.
---

2 years ago when they were starting development, I could have really answered this question, but now a couple weeks from release?  oof.  
---
At the end of the day, the limit is a big problem.  If that limit is truly insurmountable I only see one option.  Anet needs to let delta continue to develop arcdps build templates.  And then we all have to hope delta decides to do that. And possibly, Anet could have some information exchange to help delta.  
---
I could say all sorts of pie in the sky bullshit to make the first party solution work, but in a two week time frame?  I just don't think your going to be able to do a gigantic overhaul in that time.
---
I don't know, he had some pretty nice things to say about NCSoft. I'd wager if his studio takes off, he wouldn't turn down their partnership again.
---
No subscription fee is used as an excuse to both not deliver content and nickel and dime people for everything. If you're going to find ways to constantly charge me for stuff, then the "we don't have the resources to develop more content" argument becomes a lot harder to rationalize.
---
It would be a lot easier to swallow all this if I was excited for upcoming PvE content or elite specs or *something*.
---
Yeah, ultimately i know its probably not gonna be more than some wishful thinking given that changing the system beyond number adjustments probably isnt feasible anymore. Just makes me sad that we couldnt give any input before the system was already in such a late stage.
---
Fun fact: the way Arc did it actually did lead to items being destroyed and since it went through the back end it doesn't ask for confirmation and since ANet didn't actually support Arc, if you lost items they wouldn't restore them.
---
But that isn't a scandalous take that serves my own twisted narratives about the studio! Why can't you let me sink countless hours into a game I so clearly hate?! /s

Given the comments I've seen regarding how messy and unreadable the map code is in the game, a UI/UX issue might actually be *harder* to solve.

---
I wonder if it's a coincidence that many male "allies" turn out to be terrible sexual predators...
---
&gt;I think some of the dissonance here is that people are evaluating the  templates based on what they were expecting, and finding differences,  instead of evaluating what is actually being delivered. 
---
It's not exactly about what we expected and what we got. It's more about what we already have **for free** and what we will **have to pay for** in the future.
---
Aside from that, having 2 Equipment Template slots is useless for a Legendary user unless you're willing to pay for the extra slots. You'll have your Leggy gear and will be able to swap it between 2 attributes/builds. After that, it's far easier to hold Ascended gear in your inventory and double-click 10 inventory slots than to manually select attributes for 6+ pieces of Legendary gear.
---
I'm mostly just impressed that you managed to mistype it twice.
---
Oh yeah, I didn't think about that, ty mate

It’s one of the faster dungeons.  When I played, my group would run it 2-3x a day. Missing out

---
Like, you got sacked. There's no conspiracy with Anet involving dipshits like GGers. You were also a toxic person over a year ago and you've yet to better yourself. Fuck off and move on.
---
I think they meant, they'd pay gems for the entire idea of build templates in the sense that they wanted them so bad they'd actually pay.  The thought of actually paying for said extra templates is what's making some people angry when it was kinda obvious Anet would do that given bank slots, bag slots, character slots, etc.
---
And only use them once in a blue moon.
---
[deleted]
---
I think most people realize that the Trait Templates aren't too much of a problem for the exact reasons you listed. Personally I'd say it's still pretty weird having to store Chatlinks externally to utilize a System meant to minimize the Time you need to change between Builds, but I can still deal with that.
---
ANets Templates are faster, that's true, but mostly because Delta (Dev of Arc) added a delay to how fast his Templates work in certain Areas (most notibly WvW, for the same Reason ANet will probably only allow Templates inside your own Keep; but also inside Raids and most Open World Maps (no clue why tbh)) but in the Aerodrome for example your whole Build gets changed in like 3-5 seconds, which is completely fine imo.
---
The Loading Times in Areas with a Delay can be annyoing, as I often start to load the Template and then get in Combat, which pauses the Change.
---
Since you said that you aren't too familiar with Arc, a very short Rundown:
---
You could save Templates in 4 different Categories, which are Traits, Skills, Gear and Legendary. You could give your Template a Name in each Category, and if you chose to have 4 Builds with the same Name (e.g. "Harrier" for the Standard HealDruid Build) and clicked on one of the Templates while holding Shift, all 4 were selected and, after clicking on a "Load" Button", loaded.
---
The whole process takes about 20 seconds max, even with the delayed swap in some parts of the game. And you can save as many Templates as you want.
---
Now, with ANets system, you can't load Gear and Trait Template at the same Time, which isn't too bad, but still worse than Arc.
---
The biggest problem for me though is, that ANets Templates are in a Full Time Auto Save State, where each change to your current Build will be immediately saved. 
---
So if I would create the aforementioned "Harrier" Build for my Druid and change my Weapons to Axe/Axe Axe/WH instead of Axe/WH Staff and my Gear to more Berserker Pieces because I don't need as much healing on a given Boss, the next Time I load that Template I will have to change everything back to Full Harrier and reequip the Staff.
---
I also can't just make another Template for that specific Build, because my 6 Slots are already taken by other Stats I regularly use on that Character (atm on my Ranger: Harrier, Minstrel, Seraph, Viper, Berserker, Assassin's, Marauder (whoops, that's already 7 anyway, gotta scrap one of them))
---
&gt; I fully expect SnowCrows/Metabattle/etc to start considering that a "build" for some content would be having 2-3 different builds buffered up, and quickswapping per combat inside. This is something new
---
Not exactly sure what you mean here. SC already lists the best Builds for every Class on every Encounter, and, as we're talking about Raids here, you can't change your Build during an Encounter, so nothing will change here.
---
For Metabattle, they may add smth like this for Fractals (also discretize, as they are a Fractal Guide Site), but most people just change their Traits while running up to the next enemy, as it's not worth waiting to change everything if it just makes your Build slightly better (One thing more hardcore Players hoped for - being able to quickly change Weapons for Fractals for perfect Sigils on them without having to equip them over the Inventory yourself, won't be possible, as there are way too many options (8 different Sigils depending on which Fractal you're in))
---
&gt; Swapping out the 15-17 bits of gear to go from power to condi to whatever, is now easy. Easy enough that I'll likely actually do it now, where it was just too much bother before. And free storage! That alone is something no one thought we'd get.
---
Without Arc and with Asc. Armor instead of Legendary, you would have to perform 30-32 Clicks to change your whole Gear from Power to Condi (and however much you need for Traits), which, if used to, won't take more than 1 1/2 minutes, so, while annoying, not completely out of the questions (for Legendary Armor it would be more than twice the amount)
---
The Gear being stored inside the Template is something a lot of people asked for, and the Storage isn't free, it's the Main Feature we are paying for when buying Gear Template Slots.
---
Oh, and expect Gear Slots as well as The Character Bound Trait Templates to be sold Character wide, not Account wide
---
We'll see if it was only professionalism or what he really thinks about them eventually (or not if ncsoft never offer).
---
Either way, he couldn't trash talked them in his announcement.
---
So? How does that make them shutting down a profitable game not stupid?
---
Yes but if I'm aware Massively was a GW website years ago I believe Rubi Bayer who now works at Anet and Bogotter worked for them but I could be wrong.
---
Looking kinda mossy, there.
---
Nah - of course that helps - but it doesnt solve what real Templates offer to me - for example for power slb i have made builds with the right amount precision by swapping some Things to Assassin's Stats and taking x precise infusions. A template is just perfect Here because I can make the build once and then save it instead of trying to fiddle with it every time or writing it down in some editor and then look it up every time... In fact I believe this is what most people thought of when they had "build templates" in mind. Instead we get limited loadouts now..
---
&gt; No builds benefit from not choosing a grandmaster trait.
---
Because grandmaster traits are intended to always be *strict upgrades.* That means big shade should be a *strict upgrade* over baseline, since it takes up a grandmaster slot.
---
Somewhere, someone is making the exact same complaint about whatever build you're currently playing.
---
You're really asking why a korean-focused company shut down a game that isn't profitable in korea?
---
Id toss them a $20 if the templates were actually templates, and if it was intuitive and easy to use.
---
Its none of those things.  They cant even go the length of a bumbled PR video without contradicting themselves and the things they show on the screen while theyre talking.
---
I read the attached article.  
---
It’s well known that a couple of years ago, Mike O stepped away from GW2 to form a “separate project team” focused on game projects unaffiliated with GW2.  The Kotaku article suggests (via an unnamed source) that the stuff they were working on would have turned into GW3. 
---
If this is true, it makes me wonder if the GW3 project was actually approved by NCSoft.  I suspect Mike O was trying to build something first and then get it approved NCSoft.  It’s a bit of a coincidence that Mike O’s “separate project team” was the ones that were axed during the mass staff layoffs.  
---
As a side note, I think GW3 would have been a big mistake.  The MMO market is extremely oversaturated at the moment and there is very little guarantee that GW3 would have been successful.  I don’t think Arena Net has learnt from the project management mistakes of GW2 and there is a very high chance that GW3 would have launched with the exact same problems as GW2.  Additionally GW2 had the success of GW1 rely on whereas a GW3 project would have to rely on the comparatively mediocre success of GW2.  Last but not least, GW3 would have been reinventing the wheel (same wheel with slightly better graphics and less content).
---
“Games as a Service” is where the game market is currently heading.  Arena Net has an established and profitable games service already.  What Arena net needs to go is grow and improve their GW2 service and the only way to do this is to overhaul and relaunch the game under a direction.  There needs to be a new story (100% unrelated to the Elder Dragons) and new gameplay mechanics (100% unrelated to Masteries).  Lastly, Arena Net need to look at what competition are doing with their MMO products as they are rapidly falling behind.
---
Realistically, you'd never notice these boxes getting offloaded from the ground.  Considering this map came out quite a long time before mounts, or before any way to get up here outside of exploits, the fact that someone bothered to add this detail amazes me.
---
not when they refuse to simply acknowledge the small mistake caused by a disconnect in communication
---
&gt; Your only choices are top, mid or bottom. That's the definition of horizontal upgrades, and all classes have a similar difficult choice to make.
---
Right. Big shade is horizontally different from the other two grandmaster choices. *So it already has trade-offs.* You said it needed to have trade-offs, well here they are:
---
&gt; Demonic Lore: Torment you inflict deals more damage and causes your foes to burn.
---
&gt; Feed From Corruption: When you remove or corrupt a boon from an enemy, gain that boon.
---
You don't get to choose these if you choose Sand Savant. Bam, trade-offs.
---
Actually it does the mordremoth fight in HoT has your mentor from the story in it. The Caudecus instance from Head of the Snake episode has you remarking on the actual dungeons. There are other instances that have your mentors in them and if you didn't have a mentor you'd have Trahearne.
---

Demand -&gt; Supply

That is to say the original developers of the Guild Wars Franchise: :ArenaNet, made a game that captured people’s hearts as their core values of creating that fantastic game (honestly if you haven’t played it go do so now), was at the time to compete with Blizzard’s World of Warcraft, which had a ridiculous monetisation standard whereby charging it’s users a monthly fee..
---
I’m not saying charging people a subscription is bad, it’s very smart if you can capture the right audience (which it did). 
---
However when you use this original Guild Wars and take the name to imply a sequel, ergo Guild Wars 2, then these same core values should have been at the heart of the game to capture the same audience who loved the game and spent money on its expansions, additional storage and character slots, outfits etc. 
---
GW2 is heavily monetised compared to Guild Wars 1, and although it’s not a monthly subscription I’ve definitely paid for GW2 many times over. 
---
But I was happy to do this. 
---
Now, I fear I won’t be supporting this game any further. 
---
They have not stuck to their core values and I would argue that not a single GW 1 developer will remain in the studio going forward.
---
Something definitely changed after Eye of the North, and unfortunately Guild Wars 2 lacks the polish that I enjoyed in Guild Wars 1. 
---
This comment went for too long. I’m just disappointed on many decisions they’ve made over the years and I don’t see any hope now for this game.
---
I honestly don't notice stuff like this because I turn off postprocessing.  The reason being I can't stand those glowing outlines that show up on ANYTHING when you highlight it with your mouse.
---
Yup. Still waiting on a good answer to my question.
---
It was making money in the West, so why'd they shut it down?
---
Let's say the game was making a million dollars a month, but it was in the West, and NCSoft is a Korean company so they shut the game down. Now it's making them 0 dollars a month.
---
How is that not a stupid decision? Did the Western profit they were making have cooties on it?
---
STALKER?
---
Ah, and that day, nothing of value was lost.
---
The suits at NCSoft gave him plenty of rope (the freedom to start some side projects) which obviously never panned out, thus hanging himself and his side project people.  NCSoft gave him his chance and obviously he came up with nothing viable.  Doe anyone know what any of the side projects were that flopped?
---
I find it amusing that people want to freeload even more when they don't pay a sub fee to begin with. You're not entitled to free stuff. 
---
"should have been in the base game from the get" is just your opinion, the game did just fine for years before templates were added. GW1 is not an MMO and WoW is a sub based game, they are getting paid every month to develop that stuff, here you want it for free.
---
This is some good reporting. I see a lot of points being supported by examples and evidences.
---
All of those revealing articles as well as reliably accurate leaks were by one writer: Jason Schreier, it's been his articles alone that have been anything worth reading on Kotaku (exempting maybe his more opinionated articles, just his informational articles are what I'm referring to here). This dude is not Jason Schreier, so I'm very sceptical about anything from him, until we get solid evidence that he's right.
---
Because most dedicated to gw2 are gw1 veterans who still have rose tinted glasses and believe that gw1 is better because muh nostalgia when in reality both games are very different gameplay wise. Only thing that connects them is lore.
---
Man that would be a sweet card in white and very on-flavour. Probably too good for standard though. Wonder if it inspired TNN?
---
"Evon has chastised the idiot who used the Asura-standard measurements and has already sent out replacements to those clients affected"
---
Forgive me, but I read about the templates the other day and I’m super excited! They sound so awesome! Being able to swap out my entire equipment and build to an alternate sounds really fun! But all I can find in the community is complaints and negative opinions on it. Am I missing something?
---
please keep posting in twitter people are calling you names, drama and stirring shit is the best content.
---
Thats a common thing in every MMO's "everything in the game is fine and if you disagree you're stupid" community.
---
Leave the game if you dont like how theyre doing things, its perfect and you're retarded, yaaaaaaaay.
---
6+ months of no new content is standard for most games. It's not like they can develop and publish a whole new map and achievements every month
---
Are you going to pay the 60 dollars or 1000+ gold its going to take for me to get access to what i already have for FREE with arc dps...? No...? 
---
Then fuck off and let me vent my frustration.
---
A lot of it is about perception and how people manage their entertainment money.
---
Some people would pay a one time fee for the "complete" feature.
---
Some would be OK getting partial features for a partial (but proportionally higher?) cost.
---
And others would be OK just paying a $15 monthly fee like some MMOs charge so that they get a decent content and update schedule.
---
...You'd probably please the greatest number if you went for Option 1. ANet went with Option 2.
---
I mean, you did just answer your own problem.
---
If ANet suddenly said that they were implementing custimizable markers (which they already have in personal waypoints and the like), you wouldn't find me complaining that it's worse than TacO. Arc is good for a reason
---
Thats far and beyond the point.
---
Is the CoH stuff still just not known? Because I thought it was fairly understood now that CoH was shut down because the studio asked NCSoft for funding to create a new project, then went behind their backs to put it into CoH. That's why they closed it- the studio stole money from them.

Oh well. Sorry, this is the first time I have ever heard of it. Thanks for putting in the time and effort though!
---
I own the 100$ version of this game. Completely forgot it existed tbh. What a shitter
---
For once i'm kinda ok with how the update was. It felt very "here is things players want".  Full of fluff "hey target practice and bumper cars sorta  like we've teased since divinity's reach". Same with the chef and the bar drink delivers. Some lil hide n seek, decent jumping puzzle, handful of niche spots to explore. Felt a very much a condensed"all stars" with overall improvements to a lot of recent additions even having a beetle race. Even thou for me strike missions like many others "lol what is this 4man content joke", I still have to constantly pull dying pugs back to us with shade 4.  It kind of was there to set a basic foundation  and I feel they hit the mark. It does suck highly I have to rely on minigames while I wait for real meat again.
---
But they should, I paid $30 two years ago.
---
/s
---
As far as I know, that was a single "insider" report and unsubstantiated.  Given the fact that we already have a legally proven instance of NCSoft literally trying to steal from a developer, I'm not inclined to give that report the benefit of the doubt.
---
My guardian has:
---
Power DH
---
Quickbrand
---
Healbrand
---

---

---
PvP Damage
---
WvW 
---
If I raided, I would also have to have a variation of Healbrand with a different gear set for times where I wasnt tanking,  If I did serious WvW or PvP, I would need additional sets.
---
The way the new templates work, if I USE them with the equipment sets I use, it will take more time than manually changing gear from my bags, because I will have to remove certain pieces from certain sets in order to use them on sets that are above the limit to save.
---
The alternative to this is make another character that does the exact same thing this character does, but what sense would that make over having the things they call templates just work like templates should work.
---
My husband basically begged me to play GW2 almost four years ago. I was an avid console gamer for my entire life, but my computer game experience included The Sims and Goat Simulator. Four years later. He stopped playing long ago. I have a guild that I've been actively involved in every single day since then 😂 every time he tries to get back into it he gets mad because I know so much more than him lol
---
She's an awful human being.
---
First things first, join an active guild. This will give you something to do inbetween getting completion for whatever you go for, plus the social aspect is great.
---
I would recommend starting crafting, but get all the mats yourself instead of buying which gives you something extra to do instead of just buying everything you need. 
---
Probably make a list of everything you want to do, alphabetize them and Strat from the start? 😂
---
What he announced was that he stepped down from the leadership role to focus on the side projects, he didn't say anything about leaving, that's a more recent thing.
---
What do you want to do? Without a focus it's hard to give advice. So I'd say choose one or more between fractals, WvW, raids, sPvP and look them up.
---
If you want an specific objective like a certain skin or legendary item, those will also be your options to achieve it. Unless you just farm gold to buy them but IMO that's pretty boring.
---
Since I'm a WvW'r too I picked it up through the WvW track instead, which if you play that game mode is fairly straightforward.
---
Choose your poison!
---
Then they complain about it LOL
---
Bingo. Finally someone here is actually rubbing two brain cells together:
---
Btw.. I had spoken to you about the text thing on markers.  Like being able to copy text to clipboard from a marker.. for example a waypoint code.  As some tekkit routes have multiple parts and direct you to a waypoint.  Being able to press a hotkey standing over a marker that would copy the code to clipboard would be a small, but huge benefit.
---
Not sure if you looked into that?
---
We relied on it because we had to for years.

Aha, I see. How could I have been so ignorant when the answer was right there the whole time?? ;)
---
as someone else pointed out, runecrafters is the best to use on identified green gear. thats because they have a rune slot where the salvage kit has a higher chance to grant charms etc. and at least for me, you definitely notice it. Is it necessary? Not as much as the copper one, but if you have enough mystic stone to craft mystic salvage kits you should get runecrafters second. maybe even if you don't have enough mystic stones. I have a lot and use them, but I don't regret buying the silver one.
---
Hopefully it's not a mobile game or an ARPG dungeon crawler.
---
The "How fun/annoying is this to play *against?*" question is something I wish more developers considered. Honestly the main reason I quit Overwatch is because a huge portion of the roster consisted characters that just ruined the fun for me whenever they were on the enemy team. Same goes for Mesmer in Guild Wars whether it's been OP or not, it's always been annoying.

I forget. Why did she get fired again? I remember she really pissed off the community, I just don't remember the specifics.
---
Explanation : Most of Humans are inferior to bots. When you accompany bots well and keep it alive, it often destroy all unskilled humans. Synthetic Age has begun!
---
&gt;If anet provided a GOOD system, it would easily out compete a third party addon.  
---
  
---
Thing is, they *did*. Having build templates on hotkeys is what I wanted ever since I started using arcdps templates. Having bonus storage for gear is also a huge boon.  
---
If templates came at a time when I was confident there was content for me on the horizon, maybe I would be ok with the cost. But nothing about the game has changed except that I need to give anet money to keep playing the same content the same way I have been.
---
Its going to take more than micro transactions and gem monetization to bring the game out of its "slump". They need to use all of the pieces at their disposal (many of the systems currently in the game) to do this in a way that is **sustainable**. Adding gem store stuff with a story every 3-5 months is not sustainable.
---
Not everyone acts in good faith, neither in voting nor in commenting in the first place.  Some attenuation of the whiney bitchfest is a legitimately superior community.
---
Okay. Thank you very much for your great work!
---
This is a good take. I'm always surprised when people say "I hope they announce GW3" considering it would likely by DoA.
---
Those same people most likely quit the game by now. And most didn't expected it to be super limited(unlike Arcdps) and double monetized.
---
I think since the nerf to Sigil of Geomancy you can even just camp shortbow.
---
"we would pay for it" I see as more of a joke; the joke being that it has been so long with no word on these basic ass features that throwing cash at them must get their attention. That is the vibe I got from streams, videos, and forum posts. No one seemed to actually want to have to pay for this.
---
Yep. In total I raid 4 times a week. I run a guild static, and guild training runs, and I'm also a primary support in another static group. That one would be ok without me, but the ones I organize and lead?
---
I'm not planning on giving them up any time soon. But nor will I suffer the cost of build templates. Maybe if they give raiders some new content I can justify spending money on templates. But I'm not absorbing that steep a cost to keep playing the same old content.
---
rly wish they'd update/overhaul the preview UI so you could do things like view your character in different lighting and different poses as you change armor and such, and also change the camera angle and zoom in/out.  maybe add a pose mode in general so you can get better screenshots as well, with options for different lighting, effects and backgrounds.
---
probably won't ever happen but i can dream ;\_;
---
Well the US courts disagree as Garriott sued and won $28M from NCSoft.  https://www.law360.com/articles/280298/5th-circ-affirms-gaming-pioneer-s-28m-stock-option-win
---
The game was deeply flawed and was likely destined to fail...oh, and I must have been that third guy you saw because I bought a Collector's Edition!  But the reason they killed it prematurely was to try and screw Garriott out of his money.
---
I _do_ agree that they propped up WildStar (which I _loved_) much longer than I expected, however I expect that during that extended period that it was revenue neutral or close to it.  I wish they had found a way to keep it going, but I do not begrudge them the shutdown of WildStar.
---
Who knows, maybe, if NCSoft comes to an agreement with the folks running the Homecoming "private" City of Heroes servers, they'll see value in also allowing a fan-supported WildStar implementation...a guy can hope!
---
Let's discuss the competition, then.
---
As it stands, before templates become available in-game, the majority of the raiding community is relying on the continued good graces of a volunteer. This means that anet is, by extension, also relying on this third party person as well. This is an uncomfortable position to find yourself in, where some other guy can just be like, "yeah, I'm done" and suddenly a gamemode *dies overnight*.
---
So, then they go develop the best solution they can within budget and technical limitations. Unfortunately, that solution has some down-sides, but (as stated on stream), they had some serious issues with fulfilling all of the wishes.
---
So what do they do? Do they go "oh no, I have to trust this guy not to quit!"? Do they release what they can and plan to improve in the future? Do they take on the massive commitment of maintaining a third party software?
---
None of these are perfect options for any given party, so they chose the one that is safest. It will cause disruption, but at least they are in full control of a critical feature, and it provides QoL for the rest of the community, outside of raids.
---
Wowow thank you for the detailed reply. I’ll def take a lot of this into consideration! Yeah and I figured thief wasn’t used that much, I rarely see them (also I forgot to mention in original post but I’m using deadeye for elite so idk if that changes anything)
---
This, I don't think the big issue is paying to unlock more build/equipment template slots.  It's the fact that both of those are limited to only 6 slots per char (with zero indication that these will increase in the future).  Account build storage is a lesser issue in comparison, since you can just store the chat codes for the builds on a text file on your computer.  But in that case I don't see why they couldn't just do it like GW1 and have the account build storage section pull from a local file/folder.
---
There's 5 votes on that poll. Calling that support, or a trend, is ridiculous.
---
Bold of you to assume she isn't already.
---
I think this is the third one. Not sure where the other two went.
---
Not everyone who wanted build templates was willing to pay gems for it though. Regardless, Anet is the one who put a price on it, and they would've done so regardless of people vocalizing that they would pay gems for that.
---
This is very "I got mine"
---
Silver-fed is basically the same thing but for rares and exotics instead of commons and uncommons. Gives extra chance to drop ectos and the like.
---
That's the creepy thing about her twitter feed, you know. Other people's normal twitter feed will consist of both things that piss them off and things that make them happy. Hers is just.....all the rage, all the time.
---
And she tends to stick to particular topics for weeks, too. Even at my most ragey at the world, I've never.....imagined it possible to rage about JUST THE ONE THING for a week?
---
They only balance around PvP.

Log in, press Y for friend list, grey. Press G for guild list, grey. Press Y again for lfg raid, raid seller recruit.

---
idk man, if these bots are so good, then I want Anet to steal the codes and apply them to the idiot "training bots" in the mists. Maybe they could also make smarter NPC enemies in PvE with these codes.
---
Would be kinda fun to have some sort of challanging "mirror fight" in PvE, where the same rules apply to both and you basically gotta overcome the smartness of the bot.
---
Ps: At what elo do you see bots? I'm g3 / plat1 and I think I never had any in my games, but maybe I'm wrong and I have no idea how these bots play in sPvP?
---
Can we just not bring her up at all?
---
Doesn't seem like it would make a difference if you're healing in a bug. If they are the kind people who don't stack to save their lives, you have your shades. If they stack properly you don't need shades. 
---
Its a QoL nerf that only makes sense on their end. One that I don't think it justifies the nerf, but it doesn't break the class.
---
Explanation: bots plays mirage, scrapper or scourge, the first two can live in a perpetual rotation with a lot of evades and sustain and the last is just shiting all the Fs on point ontop of players centered on fighting others
---
What what. Did they release build template already?
---
There is both good and bad aspects in that approach. The way wow makes old raid gear outdated when new tier releases creates a good incentive to keep playing.
---
That's the thing, they won't be separate when build templates come out. Everyone gets three slots "preloaded with their existing equipped builds from PvE, PvP, and WvW". If you play all three game modes with separate builds, that fills up your slots. Never mind if you have several raid builds on too of that. And sure, maybe you don't play some of the game modes often enough to have a dedicated build template for it, but that still only frees up one slot.
---
Those original airships are still so damn cool looking to me. RIP the glory of Tyria
---
ANet has some really, *really* weird ideas about communication with their players. I wonder how much of it's driven by NCsoft - oriental companies are notorious about 'saving face'. 
---
But honestly, I just can't think of any sensible reason for their reaction to this. All they've got to do is talk to us... and they won't.
---
Gear templates, character bound skill templates and account bound skill templates
---
Best in game event for me personally is Halloween. So much stuff to do and those infusions get me everytime. have fun :)
---
But will Zadorojny be able to manage all of this if he is in the armory?
---
You don't know that. You don't know what other projects were, you don't know why NCSOFT canceled them, maybe they were the best game that would ever be made, maybe they were garbage and NCsoft was right, but you don't know that and you can't say that layoffs were entirely Anet fault. You don't even know what was the financial situation before layouts, did Anet made profit for NCsoft.
---
Lol @ freeload.  I'd have been better off with a sub fee in this tbh, and I have paid quite a few in other games over the years.  It would have been my preference actually because games that do have them tend to be developed more meaningfully from my personal experience. 
---
 Get over yourself with this everyone who criticizes just wants free stuff nonsense, you sound like fox news.        
---
&gt;"should have been in the base game from the get" is just your opinion, the game did just fine for years before templates were added. GW1 is not an MMO and WoW is a sub based game, they are getting paid every month to develop that stuff, here you want it for free.    
---
Your point?  People aren't allowed to criticize because they don't have to pay a sub fee after buying b2p game?  Are you old enough to remember gaming before the mobile era?
---
The problem is that GW2 isn't optimized very nicely on Multi Core Processors and CPUs with better Single Thread output generally perform better. It just so happens, though the Ryzen 5 2nd gen are decent CPUs, the 2nd Gen Ryzen's compared to their Intel counterpart have not so great Single Thread performance. My i5 3570k at base clock has a better Single Core performance than that CPU, which came out in 2012. 
---
Now the Ryzen 3rd gen CPUs that is not the case. Which is why they're being talked up so much currently.
---
There is quite a difference between wanting to pay for the entire system and having to pay for every slot on every character and still end up with not enough of them.
---
As far as i know, they aren't interested in removing access to fun places, as long as it doesn't result in an unfair advantage of some kind. People have been reaching this point and posting screenshots for a long time, before PoF even (using voidjumping, a bug which no longer exists) so i wouldn't worry about this being blocked off.
---
Instead, i would be worried about methods of mapbreaking being removed. Voidjumping was removed because it was a general purpose way of reaching many areas illegitimately, like the end of difficult jumping puzzles like Not So Secret. That qualifies as an advantage over other players.
---
If you reached this point legitimately by using Skyscale, you're fine, that's more or less intended functionality of the mount. If you used one of the several ways to gain altitude illegitimately, keep it to yourself. The less people know about those ways, the better.
---
I'm sure hell be sucesful with his team. His fellow founders of anet, is the Lead for Tera for nsoft and the other started a studio which with various other employees from anet is making State of decay. Both of which are quite known. Titles. It's quite cool when you heard what all 3 did back at blizzard.
---
Here in Germany, it would indeed be false advertising because the product does not meet the advertised specifications (in this case the size).
---
From § 434 paragraph 1 Civil Code (ger.: Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch - BGB) [translated]:
---
&gt;(1) The item is free of material defects if it has the agreed quality at the time of the transfer of risk.
---
&gt;As far as the condition is not agreed, the thing is free of material defects,
---
&gt;
---
&gt;1. if it is suitable for use under the contract, otherwise
---
&gt;2. if it is suitable for ordinary use and has a quality common to the same kind of goods and which the
---
&gt;buyer can expect according to the nature of the item.
---
&gt;The quality according to sentence 2 no. 2 also includes properties which the buyer after the public
---
&gt;statements of the seller, the manufacturer (§ 4 para. 1 and 2 of the Product Liability Act) or his
---
&gt;assistants in particular in advertising or in the labeling of certain properties can expect the case,
---
&gt;unless the seller did not know the statement and also did not know that it was rectified at the time
---
&gt;of the conclusion of the contract in an equal way or that they could not influence the purchase decision. [...]
---
The "public statement" does not need to be written so that a visual advertisement is also valid.
---
P.S.: I'm not an expert so if this is not 100% correct or something needs to be added then pls let me know so that I can fix it or remove my post.
---
GW1 was localized in Russian
---
I mean, she also thinks Avengers Infinity War and End Game are sexist, racist movies that support genocide, and every one that enjoyed that movie is guilty of said attributes.
---
&gt; If they stack properly you don't need shades. 
---
So basically I don't need a core element of my spec. Nice. Great design.
---
Do you think the time to discuss it is after its release? It is not.  Focus group testing is a common practice before a product is released for a reason.  
---
I would say, the time to bring in the community to discuss is as early as possible.  Imagine if they had decided to discuss their ideas with us 2 years ago when they began development.  Things would be in a much better state.
---
lol
---
You've created the most immersive world I've ever experienced, and I'm happy that you are now able to be the creator you've always been once again. I can't wait to see, what you are creating this time. I wish you all the best.
---
You can just dumb it on github and have a copy semi operational there without expenses
---
Hey, another rather new (9 months I think) thief main here! (Funnily enough, I also have a L80 warrior and necro - just that I used the second boost on a mirage instead of the necro :D)
---
I think the most important question is this:
---
Where do you WANT to go? :) 
---
If you think about high end PvE, this is my advice:
---
Start with fractals and ascended armor.
---
In addition to what other said about getting the trinkets via winterberries/bloodstones, start leveling your leatherworker. And whatever profession creates the weapons you are using. [You can level more profession on your other boosted characters; armorsmith on warrior, tailor on necro and just assign the ‚weapon craft‘ professions randomly :')]
---
I think with your saved up gold you should even be able to make the asc gear right off the bat, no down time.
---
For equipment builds, you can check out metabattle and snowcrows.
---
I think core thief, daredevil and dead-eye all basically rely on berserker gear; so you would craft 'Zojja's‘ armour. [or buy cheap berserker exotics from the TP, they don't cost that much]
---
While you are working on getting all your ascended stuff, start trying out fractals 1-20 - they don't need any agony resistance, and the mobs are scaled down a lot in comparison T4.  
---
You should be easily able to pug these, just be upfront with not knowing the mechanics. You might meet the odd bad apple, but in general people are understanding and happy to explain mechanics to someone who wants to learn.
---
So bitter and petty..
---
What if Anet then made forced Tekkit to stop developing map packs for Taco (or they would ban them)?  Would you complain then?
---
Uh.....    
---
Alright, you win, I concede, I want everything for free and actually that is everyone's only complaint.  Just a bunch of whining about having to pay for stuff.  Good work, your crusade is acknowledged.
---
Right? Why is that a problem to players, it is beyond me. /s
---
There are 2 sets of people.. The ones complaining about paying, and the others complaining about the limitation of how many builds they can store.
---
Are they banning Arc? If they are then that will change my answer but as far as I know it will still be legal.
---
For me personally it's been hard to be optimistic about gw2 ever since Colin left and now Mike? Nice
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b8ur72/we_won_the_war/ek2b7zy/
---
Thanks for the clarification
---
Indeed I refuse to play such builds. Your answer is sad but true...
---
Go buy some chairs, anet makes awesome content and not at all trying to milk money. Pls go buy chairs, dont be like us loosers complaining.
---
Now that you know the situation you should edit this post to help stop the spreading of this misinformation.
---
the lelvel of salt is off the charts! Seriously the fuck is wrong with her?
---
It looks weird. Peaceful gathering tools are at the middle of combat gears and combat trinkets.
---
thanks, but i do not need luck, i am pretty fine without it :)
---
Yeah ok I guess you don't PvP that much eh. But tyvm for your input mate
---
and the problem with this is what exactly?  
---
diablo, starcraft, warcraft 2, warcraft 3 engine, lead dev for battle.net.  
---
just to name a few pretty big things he worked on.
---
Thanks for all the effort and it was useful to some so it didnt fail at all.
---
and lets not forget you can only get 6 builds max with this, that's not even half of the builds many use right now (and build templets are kinda made for them right?)
---
aww man I'm sorry that happened to you.
---
I heard such fairy tales before but I can't believe them! I cannot be true!
---
The thing is most of the community has been using (approved by anet) 3rd party program that is vastly superior to the future system. And it is (by the command of anet) going away when the official templates launch.
---
Disclaimer: referencing to most players above casual level with Hardcore players, especially those who play very optimizer support builds.
---
The Problem is as follows:
---
Hardcore players are the ones that screamed the most for build templates. They way they are integrated now makes them spend a shitload of money, while other players will go with it just fine. And these others most likely won't need them.
---
Also, the way they are implemented, renders legendary armor mostly useless, except for maybe aesthetics. And you guessed it... You have to do a lot of work for legendary armor, so mostly only Hardcore players have it.
---
I enjoy pvp in small doses and then take a few months break before coming back. Once you start to get serious about the mode it becomes very frustrating imo.
---
This only lets me tweak manually my build a bit easier. And not really on the sigils side, since I'd still need to configure both individually.
---
Sure, the feature will probably see future development. But it doesn't change the fact it feels very disappointing so far.
---
I noticed there's less ad links too, the ad links were the final straw that made me switch from Chrome+Google to Firefox+DuckDuckGo. 
---
One useful tip: Add "!g" without quotation marks at DDG search bar to use Google search. I only do that as a final resort after exhausting DDG search results.
---
The pitfall is that we loose the addon we were used to, and the QOL it brought.
---
No one (well, ok, most people) is astounded or actually outraged that they want to monetize the feature.
---
More about how exactly they want to do it.
---
It's just that the coming implementation is not very useable as presented by those who wanted the templates the most.
---
Honestly, I'd be happy if they added only one thing more, and they could even monetize that.
---
Gear blueprints as well as gear loadouts.
---
(If you're curious how exactly that could work, I made a thread on it here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dcn35w/gear_blueprints/
---
Funnily enough, I got no feedback at all from the downvoters.)
---
Also a shared armory would be awesome as well (https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dcte2r/build_template_storage_should_be_free_loadouts)
---
Thank you for editing your post.  The misinformation makes the people who want a lot of builds look like total assholes, while in reality, we are being pushed into a terrible situation that will hurt our enjoyment of the game.
---
Often LI is enough as killproof for w1-4
---
Personally I hardly die against them since I play core S/D. But first the gameplay is so stupid and unskilled that it can carry monkeys. Second, the second you're a bit low on CD's you're dead,but that part is pretty normal. Third, it melts some other classes unfairly imo. And y, people telling me it's hardly a threat, y, ty for the input again...
---
&gt;I don't know if they have changed it, but you had to level up gliding per character
---
This was never, ever the case.
---
Depending on how many characters you have that isn't really that much.
---
It's just to keep your project up without paying in case you want to revisit what you had done in the future, doesn't have to be functional
---
You'd be right except the vast majority of people on the Anet forums are ultra casuals.
---
It’s fine. I’d still buy the game. It’s 60 bucks (pre discount) for a lot of fun. All the problem people are experiencing you wouldn’t until much much later.
---
I remember the time of Colin - I bought the game shortly before release and have been playing constantly since that day. And I have to say that the game was bad compared to it state after Mike O took over. Sure there was the release hype but when it faded there wasn't much to do.
---
'There were more dev teams' you say? Maybe but we waited ages for content, now we get something every few weeks. Colin had charisma and he could feed his promises to the crowd, but it was long after he was gone that they came into the game.
---
I'm a long time vet of gw2 and overall pretty satisfied with the game, especially when I compare it to the first year's till the time shortly after HoT release.
---
Your "pvx and your fucked syatement" is also invalid tho, just pointing out that that isnt really a problem. Its not like with this change they are eliminating the ability to open your inventory clip a few pieces of gear on and maybe update a trait line. Its less than a minute and if your are swapping builds so often that the periodic stop to swap after your free slots are used, theres probably a more systemic problem with the way you are playing the game.
---
People are crying like the game will be un playable, its not, nothing will change internally, the game survived this long with the VAST majority of players casual all the way to hardcore not using the build templates thru arcDPS at all.
---
Being upset with something you love is criminal! Burn them all!
---
mike o brien got sick of ncsoft putting the foot in the door and not letting him make new games so he left with a couple of new devs / ex devs (some from gw1 time) to create a new studio mana.works. it's entirely possible they took with them the projects they've been working on that ncsoft made them drop and continue them there under a new title. meanwhile ncsoft removed a link from arenanet (mo) so they can exert more control (Z director reports directly to some upper guy in NCSoft instead of Z reporting to Mike reporting to that guy).
---
Ignore the build templates drama, the chair fake advertising.
---
Game is great, ofc - every fanboy.
---
I'm not even a hard-core player, but I do raid with my friends from time to time. My 2 mains are ranger and mesmer.
---
So without exaggeration I switch between 6 builds for just 2 professions. 
---
I'm just saying it would be a lot cooler if there was no limit, cause now I have other characters without templates.
---
But why doesn't the lighting affect the hair the same way? It should appear green too.
---
I think every designer should know that too.
---

She can still run for president in the US. Everything is possible these days.
---
Who?
---
i highly doubt that. all work done/planned at anet is property of anet/ncsoft. he could if he would "buy it out". but i think it does not make a lot of sense to make a gw related product. licencing cost are a heavy weight, especially for new studios.
---
Yep, compare these "autos" against a few condi thieves dodges mate. It's weird to me that you find core S/D obnoxious but ok. It is a bit brain dead like every fuckin class right now, that's for sure. But wouldn't say obnoxious
---
You don't think people bitch about core S/D? There's a sizeable group of people who think it still needs more nerfs.
---
Everyone bitches about every build that gets kills.
---
it’s crazy to me that you’ve never heard “don’t feed the trolls” lol
---
2fast2furry
---
its amazing value for a new player.
---
recently concerns are for the more veteran players.
---
it will at least run the next 1,5 years until the living story...i mean saga is finished.
---
To be fair, NCsoft is everything but soft when it comes to the monetization of their games.
---

---
*shudders in Lineage2*
---
Lewaon no 1 - you need to have community manager in the first place
---
Not even a little surprised.
---
At this point I'd love GW3 too... 
---
GW2 is a solid game but I feel like they added everything that was possible to be added. What could still be a nice addition? Well, 3rd specialization for every class, finishing the story etc. But I don't really see new stuff besides that.
---
I wish they would take what's good in gw2 and moved it to gw3 and learned from their mistakes.
---
*its
---
If you could back this up with statistics I would be more inclined to believe your claim. 
---
I could just claim that pretty much all casual players don’t ever touch their forums.
---
And there are WAY more casual players than hardcore players.
---
&gt; and there is still some sort of unannounced "thing" being worked on by the fourth team, though I doubt it's an expansion.
---
As someone out of the loop, can you elaborate on this for me? What source is this based on..?
---
I dream about playing gw2 with my wife. I wish i could make her addicted somehow :(
---
Was it that guy who tried to make a big deal about not being a mod anymore? And nobody cared or even knew who he was?
---
What followed was Season 2 two months later?? Are you sure you're not mixing it up with the HoT content drought?
---
Or you cant be atsed to read it and want a TLDR summary?
---
It could also just be as basic as data storage, each template is data to store and they might not have enough space, something similar happened with Rivens in Warframe where each player is limited to maximum of 100 due to storage.
---
The game is already heavely designed around the gemstore. (make things really unconfortable to "suggest" gemstore spendings)
---
and if i look at the amount of especialy mountskins that they realease and the prizes they charge for it, this should be enough to at least "keep the game running".
---
Remember they had pretty stable incomes the last quarters.
---
i have no problem with a company that tries to make a profit, but if the profit becomes more important than customer satisfaction i have to draw a line.
---
especially when in my opinion, this companys monetisation model WAS pretty fair in the past, but over the time its getting more and more aggressive.
---
which leads to me thinking of 2 possible reasons:
---
the game is indeed in financial troubles (income says otherwise)
---
or that they want to get every buck possible out of it no matter how.
---
&gt; Gear loadouts also do not exist in GW1 (except for PvP only characters) and are MASSIVELY convenient in that they also store your armor/weapons/trinkets in template slots, thus freeing up valuable inventory space. I also feel that it is perfectly reasonable to charge for these simply because they include item storage. Ther is of course the issue with legendary gear, but I do feel like anet might be able to include a feature to this in the future that allows for something like that. Unfortunately at this time I am unsure what the solution would be for legendary gear, but I feel like that is something that could be addressed later on in development. 
---
I beg to differ.
---
Legendary gear has existed in the game for a very, very, VERY long time. Not only that. It has always been considered the "ultimate" goal in the game in some respects. I feel any template release that doesn't address it is a gigantic failure.
---
Are you serious?
---
You don't need statistics for this, pretty much everyone who played GW2 over a longer period of time can tell you their forums sucks.
---
Wasnt the prologue been working on for the past 10months or so?
---
Think i heard someone talking about parts of it during a live stream chat
---
Just a tip: Go into Control Settings look under camera and bind the Toggle Action cam .  Now you have an overlay of weapons distance , when it targets and you no longer need to hold down right click.  Been playing seven years this Christmas and ever since they added that feature i haven't used normal settings since.  Also makes it easier for anyone not used to PC gaming or been playing for 18ys and don't wanna hold down right click lol.
---
They said they were thinking of bag - bank slot prices (400-600 gems) but no price confirmation or package details yet.
---
&gt; The ones who complain who have to pay are minimal, pretty much everyone would be willing to pay for this.
---
Do you have different /r/Guildwars2 or what? In almost every thread regarding templates I see people complaining that they have to pay for this while arcdps templates were free. After work I can give you at least 10 links as proof if you want.
---
If you took the time to read, you'd know price is only the second issue, far from the first one : the future system won't cover the needs.
---
 he wasn't involved in gw2 for a long time, it's just a formality, nothing changes
---
I can read and I see what they wrote.
---
You could play the slow game. Bring about societal change that takes a generation or two to go into effect. This would prevent the nasty civil war and doesn't breed a two century long brainwashing that to this day still causes the South to long for the days of the Confederacy.
---
At which point does one cross the line and become a hardcore player?
---
Seems like there are people out there with 1 buid/character/race out there,having total of 20+ characters.
---
There are players using multiple characters with 3-6+ builds
---
There are players with 9 professions and all raid builds on all of them.
---
So really... how far in this game do i have to go crazy with character slots and perfect ascendant meta gear for all occasions across all characters in order to become a hardcore player that has an issue of absolutely needing to buy hundreds of dollars worth of gems for template slots?
---
actually we also sometimes get feed about what new employees the studio is looking for in order to try guess what / how the future of the game could be.
---
WoW has a subscription model. GW2 is f2p with QoL and cosmetic items in shop. But apparently this subreddit wants every feature for free, as well as supporting the game for years.
---
&gt; The quality of content has decreased significantly since early HoT.
---
I would argue the newest patch is some of the best content the game has. It lacks a raid or fractal but the new map/metas/strike is really great.
---
Apparently you didn‘t get the point of the discussion. The problem is **not** that there’s the option to buy more slots in the gem shop. **The problem is that these slots are disproportionately overpriced and extremeley limited**.
---
Sorry but this meme is just out of context. Sad to see that according to the upvotes many people don‘t get it.
---
Yes because Kotaku (the well known click bait fake news site) is known for fair game yournalism.
---
Yes. I’m very serious. Been with the guild wars franchise for 14 years now. Participated in the GW2 beta, waited in line for 2 hours at gamescon Köln to play a 30 minute demo and I’m a day 1 player. Maybe I don’t meet your criteria, but I like to think of myself as a veteran by now. I still dable on the official forums. I still enjoy the game tremendously and I’m glad we are getting another feature for the game to which they could’ve said “fuck it, we’re not doing build templates for GW2”. 
---
You might believe in fairytales, but I’d rather believe in statistics. So you can whine and cry all you want about “tHe HaRdCOrE pLAyErS dOn’T RePrESeNT tHe PoLls oN tHe ForUm” I choose not to believe that.
---
GW Mobile. What else would it be? Ain’t nobody original enough to come up with anything else. TES Blades exists. Diablo Immortal. Whatever that Command and Conquer Mobile game is. CCP is making a mobile eve game because why not.
---
Each episode has a timespan like that. Three teams alternating releases
---
There is Rubi and Stephane that keep the forums updated and actively engage with the community.
---
What are you talking about? HoT wasn't very good, quality of content only rose. Quanity peaking during PoF...
---
Copy and paste news is not actively engage with the community
---
Casual has nothing to do with whether you like to discuss the game outside of the game itself and everything to do with your mindset and playstyle within the game.
---
But sure let's go with your definition anyway, the fact that they use the Arenanet forums over reddit only amplifies how wrong you are - the non-casuals seek external sources to discuss their game, the casuals simply use the discussion platform that they can access by clicking a link in the launcher and thus, they need to put no effort or thought into finding a better platform over the one provided for them by Arenanet. If a casual has something they want to discuss or connect with people it's way more likely that they would end up on the official forums over Reddit.
---
The source is:
---
* They have four teams
---
* Three of them are working on Icebrood Saga stuff
---
By inference, we know that team four is working on some "thing" that hasn't been announced.
---
Agreed, though it's no longer of our concern as it will not affect Guild Wars directly.
---
I have this feeling that one of the canceled projects as something to do with this (not necessarily a mobile game), though using Anet and GW profits to fund it was not in NCsoft interests.
---
It seems that his had nothing to do with NC, I get the feeling that they are in good terms.
---
Probably the new studio he will create will also be under NCsoft investment. difference is that it will not "milk" our game any longer.
---
When people said pay, they probably didn't mean pay the equivalent of an expansion for a fundamental basic gameplay feature.
---
My only guess on this is, that NCSoft reeled Arena Net in. Many people tend to forget that Arena Net had all the freedom and money they wanted because of GW1. You can say about NCSoft what you want, but they didn't do the same stuff with Arena Net as they did with other companies. So they might have had a special treatment over the years.
---
I guess what happened now was, that NCSoft didn't want to rely on "We will deliver something big, just wait a bit longer!" anymore. And that's why they took over now to make sure that the franchise they paid for all these years, will not go under because of some side projects that went nowhere.
---
OMG ITS SC ?! POGGERS
---
&gt;I'm curious to hear from people who have had more positive experiences from community management in other titles - particularly the original Guild Wars. What lessons could be learned from those other games
---
Easy. Don't fire Gaile Gray.
---
"I'd pay for that" seems like a really common saying for a lot of things, and usually people say it over stuff they aren't actually prepared to pay, but would really like. e.g. "I'd pay someone to make a mindless clone of myself who can go to work for me", but wouldn't/couldn't actually pay for.
---
Unfortunately ArenaNet don't seem to be aware of this.
---
&gt; You don't need armor that delivers four different stats
---
This isn't so cut and dry. Armor that has more than 3 stats will have less total of any one stat, but will have more total stats. This means that merely mixing and matching different pieces of 3 stat gear would result in less total stats than using a relevant 4 or more stat set. I for one really like that there are stat sets that contain more than 3 stats but with more total stats because it allows for more hybrid builds. I like to mix in a bit of marauder gear to my builds because for the low HP classes like thief/elementalist, 11k hp just feels too dang squishy and too liable to get 1 shot. But if I had to use some Valkarie gear instead of marauder, my DPS would take a greater hit for gaining a given amount of HP gain as compared to using Marauder.
---
Is it hard to be that dense or does it come naturally?
---
Or Tabula Rasa. They also turned EU\US Lineage 2 in it's prime into shitty botfest by completely ignoring illegal programs, RMT and hordes of afk leveling bots.
---
Just fyi. There is a difference between getting fired and getting let go....
---
I see! Thank you for explaining. So it’s not about people just wanting more than they’re given, but in fact people having what they already possess taken away and replaced with an inferior substitute. 
---
I don’t really notice the cash-grab nature in Guild Wars to be fair. I’ve played a lot of games where I’ve paid full price and am still stuck behind a paywall if I want to actually enjoy the game. But with Guild Wars I’ve only ever spent money on the initial purchase, and then the two expansions, and am still really enjoying it to this day. There’s always new content to enjoy for free and I’ve always got something new to do and try and explore without having to worry about cost.
---
What they do charge for usually seems cool but unnecessary and as the game is now free to play, I totally understand the need for those items being on the market. Things like extra bag slots, premium items, replaying missed Living World episodes, etc. It seems like a fair thing to charge for.
---
However as someone has already explained to me, I’m not a good representative of a lot of the player base as there are far more people that take it more seriously and grind and stuff, and for them a lot of the content I see as superfluous and an unnecessary purchase, they actually *need* to best play how they play and it can seem like a huge disappointment when features and items that they need for gameplay keeps getting locked behind paywalls.
---
Thank you for helping me see the other side to the argument! \^.^
---
To be fair he at least had the decency to leave
---
You mean be dynamic?
---
He hadn't been moderating for ages before that so didn't really matter. Which is why there were so many "who" comments.
---
I am not a white knight, I get people are pissed about missing functionality. What I do not get is people getting all pissed about paying in a game that has monetized fucking inventory slots, what did they expect?
---
Well, we know the layoffs were in response to NCSoft shares dropping and them wanting to renew investor confidence by cutting costs.
---
Real "smart"... ask people how many builds they use when the game doesnt support swapping builds.
---
Like a self fulfilling prophecy.
---
A list of Heads, Leads, Managers, and Specialists, but an obvious lack of personnel who would actually go out to people and do the work, integrate (with) the community, reframe the official forums, and just talk to people as their daily job.
---
But my Ultimate Dominator title! Been working on that more or less (mostly less) last 7 years, this week reached 80,000 kills. Slowly but steadily.
---
Staff ele, scourge and FT engi are the best taggers. Now especially scourge with 10 target shades. FT engi is the funniest though with permanent stability, 25 might (too) and rocket boots for escape or chase. If guardian would still have old autoattack (waves), I probably would play that too.
---
I love the nukes what staff ele provides. 25 might + fury, meteor shower, arcane blast, lava fonts, every other aoe from staff, fgs aoe = absolutely massive damage if placed in tight spots. Enemy players simply start getting downed here and there. Even staff fire autoattack hits hard. Staff ele does so much damage, it gets WXP from gates. Whaaat?
---
Thank you! 
---
Don’t know why you’ve been downvoted!!
---
Some responses have made me see why people are having an issue with what the update is providing so I see now why people are a little upset. But as it’s more to do with their play-style, it seems I won’t be as affected. 
---
As long as the feature is still free and is everything it seems it will be, I’m still excited and can’t wait to start swapping out equipment for more variety in my play style! \^.^
---
Perhaps, I never had problems with condi thief. Their skills are fairly easy to dodge and when they are out of resources you can just strike them down. 
---
Besides you shouldn’t rely on Anet, instead rely on yourself try to counterplay. If you notice your team can’t deal with it try to deal with the condi thief yourself so your yeam doesn’t need to deal with it.
---
And sometimes you just have a team that’s not that good or with a lot of newcomers. Finish that match and move on.
---
You're afk 70% of the time with what you explained. What's the point of tagging if enemy doesn't die? You job as ele is constant pressure and zone control, not tagging and running away.
---

---
Now you’re just dreaming! 😂
---
&gt; I meant how many hours of story content will I get out of HoT and PoF, on average.
---
Sorry, I can't really give a single number, as I did it spread over 5 months.
---
But if you want to do the maths yourself, starting from [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prologue:_Rally_to_Maguuma) for HoT and [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sparking_the_Flame_(Prologue\)) for PoF, you can just go through the story chapters looking at the right infobox (to avoid spoilers), and search for each chapter's name on youtube - as they all have walkthroughs up there - so you can see from the length of those videos in the results list, how long each story chapter takes.
---
Btw if you're interested in the story, there are also Living World episodes set between each expansion pack, that you can either unlock for free when they are current, or buy from the gemstore after they have passed.
---
In order it goes:
---
* Personal Story
---
* Living World Season 1 (unavailable any more, but you might have played it in 2013-14)
---
* Living World Season 2
---
* Heart of Thorns
---
* Living World Season 3
---
* Path of Fire
---
* Living World Season 4
---
* Living World Season 5 aka. Icebrood Saga (the current one, just started last month)
---
Apparently...

---
They were working on Guild Wars 3.
---
It depends. It's definitely easy to have a skeleton and from what I heard that was something that MO and a couple of selected devs personally built. We'll probably see more when they update the website on 9th.
---
Anet doesn’t get enough money from PvP that’s it. Deal with it, it won’t change unless they suddenly decide to.
---
You need to dodge their dmg or stand out of its range from dd dodge. Sw2 isn’t necessairy to dodge imo. Depends on what class you play though.
---
GW2 do not have montly sub, so the money must come from somewhere...
---
No community manager. I asked about it on the forum:
---
[https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/87617/does-guild-wars-2-have-a-community-manager](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/87617/does-guild-wars-2-have-a-community-manager)
---
But looks like ArenaNet hates their community so much that they don't have a community manager anymore, just PR people and social media people.
---
It's hard to distinguish sarcasm from genuine niceness online, we just assume the worse.
---
I want to pay for a complete unlock of build templates at a fair price. 30-40€ . As a once off unlock on all characters is fair.
---
Its going to be alot more than that and that's predatory
---
So does Arenanet lose its Guild Wars2 account for cheating taking advantage of a game glitch? If you are a New Zealander you can demand a refund under the Fair Trading Act. The act covers items PRE-sale that fall short of what is promoted or promised.
---
Their world vs all other world more like.
---
Feels like there is always one build that is annoying to play against.
---
Normal players are perfectly happy, but ultra-hardcore players are those who yell at everything and can't enjoy the game as-is.
---
Everything is ok, game is definitely not dying. There are massive amount of happy players in-game.
---
well maybe his leave wont matter much, but he is bringing with him a bunch of other current devs from gw 2. so that will make a difference, i am suspecting.
---
Could have fooled me...
---
Along with getting the d912pxy mod (if you want just follow the instructions on Github) turn character limit to lowest, shadows off and scenery distance to lowest. Probably turn off post processing to save your eyes as well.
---
Sigh ...I guess I give up here, when everyone thinks it's perfectly fine when their system is as aggressively monetized as it will likely be and the more dedicated players are expected to pay up 2-3 the price of a full game.
---
Pretty much everyone who actively uses multiple builds would happily pay a decent amount for templates, but nothing ridiculous like this, while they also will heavily limit those templates to the point its close to unusable for them.
---
Goes to show how toxic it is when everyone just assumes you're being sarcastic lol
---
Yeah I do, that was the first thing I tried
---
No, it is always harder to come out with working ideas and whole concept of the game. Then coding it is easier, as you already know what you want, then it is just mechanical issue to make it work. Especially when you are at total start and you can build stuff just as you want (this is issue with older stuff as you have to play by already set rules, or rewrite completely everything, then it takes more time indeed).
---
pretty much.
---
oh the hilarity. one can only wish he actually stuck around to watch his little scheme completely blow up in his face.
---
To be honest... I don't really care. I have a fuckton of gold I can finally spend on these build templates. And I never used ARCDps because I didn't trust it in the beginning, and even when de devs gave the "all clear" I was already over it. so for me "a casual pleb" this is a new and exciting thing.
---
Careful, we wouldn't want to be too level-headed now
---
You check a game aub everyday even though you don't own the game?
---
If they did, then they wouldn't have to release bare bones prologue, they had nothing done.
---
Projects get canceled all the time in this industry.
---
I guess then you are just as disconnected to the player base who actually needs build templates, when you think that a forum where 70%+ of the nonpositive criticism get removed, has any merit on a survey...
---
Even if it would be, completely ignoring and neglecting 25 % of those players is just wrong.
---
she's mentally ill.
---
its as simple as that.
---
Thanks. It's quality armor.
---
IDK what he has done and what he hasn't, what ideas were his own and what mistakes he was forced to commit.   
---
However and I gotta say it, this guy permitted the recent chain of USA/EU-only promotions/partnership deals and streamer benefits that has plagued gw2 for a while. Making not only me, but many players outside such regions or interests feel like 3rd-rate customers, sPvP season experiments, warclaw, Uninspired balance patches, layoffs and more. That said **GOOD RIDDANCE.**   
---
Still, to be honest chances are most of such decisions were pushed by the likes of NC Soft, sadly the world ain't made by ideals, yet here I am bitching the blame onto a guy I'm ignorant of how much he might've sacrificed for thankless punks like myself.  
---
Good luck old man, may your new adventures bring ya peace.
---
&gt; The situation worsens furthers when considering runes and infusions. We've had no indication that runes and sigils can be stored separately from armor in the Armory (AFAIK).  
---
they can, you should have watched the stream.
---
To add on to this, when I work on projects and develop a new feature I add it to my own personal library for reuse later. Stuff like networking/sockets, touch input, camera movement, parsers, physics etc would all have their own namespace and be full of components that I can drop in to new projects and use.
---
As long as its generic enough it's almost impossible to prove that you 'stole' a function or class. Especially since its your own damn work so you can explain piece by piece how it works if you ever had to.
---
Really the assets/ip would be a bigger issue.
---
I address that in my post. You can gain that functionality, but at the cost of gaining ascended sets, turning that legendary set into an expensive ascended item in build template functionality. It is effectively a 2000 gold tax for buying into a previous solution.
---
The issue with the current situation of fashion swapping requiring multiple sets is negated entirely by inclusion of template storage.
---
Ever since rando asshat clusterfuck she only allows whitelisted people into her echo chamber.
---
There is no real increase in speed relative to using Arc DPS from what I can see.
---
I also addressed the fashion issue - this is a feature being gained by people using ascended sets that people using legendary armor do not get; unless they buy ascended sets anyway!
---
You can also tank as a trailblazer quickbrand, it works very well. The only part where you need to think differently at all is the blurred frenzy. Either don't attack while you have confusing or just deal with it by using F2 or F3.
---
I think a lot of the issues when it comes to community relations comes from the devs wanting to avoid community conflict.
---
I know that many dev teams in games that I play are not allowed to talk about new features in the works as some players will get upset at delays or changes to the plans. I've seen several examples where a dev gets in trouble after players dug up an old comment they made on the forums and start a big controversy. This causes the dev teams to basically go into a communications lockdown and you get left with nothing but canned responses from 1 or 2 community managers.
---
You also have to consider that very few changes will be liked by 100% of a player base. Generally speaking the unhappy players will gripe loudly while the happy ones remain largely silent. This can make it seem like players are just always mad regardless of what changes are made.
---
Personally I think the solution is that the gaming companies just need to grow a bit of a backbone and stand up for their people. Instead of punishing a dev for honest open communication when some internet idiot drags up an old quote, they need to say the dev did nothing wrong and tell the trolls to stuff it. Communication of ideas in the development stage that might or might not be implemented should be encouraged, not banned. So long as the PR department keeps punishing devs that try to have conversations with the community I don't see the situation changing.
---
there was not a single project, there were multiple other projects.  
---
some of them got scrapped, some remained.
---
Amusingly, this why many people started using emoticons in the first place. Because "wonderful job on that game dude :D" is harder (but not impossible) to read as negative
---
and 18 hours of mapgrind to  get the new emote through the meta achievement.  Probably another 30 hours to hit all 25 targets too.
---
no, i didn't miss it. but when looking at the general scope of the "problem" i also do not think that this is a problem. you chose to have legendary armor in the first place as a single armor. it wasn't a problem before, why should it be now one?
---
Y'all be joking but [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Basic_Chef's_Backpack](the Basic Chef's Backpack) is basically just a cutting board too. Less meaty tho. No current way to get this meaty of a backpack.
---
I do.
---
One for all
---
are you posting this to demand an apology?
---
Because I am paying the same price for my additional equipment templates, but gaining less functionality, because I bought into a previous solution proposed by Arenanet to overcome the issue of needing to swap builds!
---
As I explained in my post, the more equipment templates you purchase and the less legendaries you have invested in the *less you get from equipment templates*. 
---
This is the exact opposite of those situations where you go to a coffee shop and get a little stamp on your card to get your tenth coffee for free. In this scenario, your previous commitment is resulting in the increased price of that coffee.
---
It leaves a pretty bitter taste in the mouth of anyone that bought into the previous solutions presented by Anet.
---
GW2 has someone responsible for the community let alone a manager?
---
or they could have, you know... forced a mod to post "hey pals we're aware of the issue, please give us some time to fix it. Thank you for your trust and patience.
---
This is why ANet doesn't care for PvP, because the community there is cringy AF.
---
In the South where people were actually owning slaves and their livelihoods were tied to owning those people? Not much.
---
So build templates joins the growing list of GW2's failings:
---
* WvW
---
* sPvP
---
* Dungones
---
* Build Templates
---
To be fair ArenaNet has *never* really had competent community management, except perhaps in the super early days when it was managed by GhostRaptor from the NCSoft team. 
---
After that the burden of actually managing the community largely fell to the fansites - and they did a great job until ArenaNet threw them under the bus.
---
Seems like a perfect strategy to me. You can insult someone without getting insulted.
---
I save up mine when the guaranteed item is interesting to me. Usually those minis for the collection.
---
No I mean among the North and rest of the world. Slavery was pretty much accepted for a long time.
---
But the video shows copy/paste options for equipment templates.
---
Where does it say you can't copy/paster equipment templates?
---
except :) is almost exclusively used to denote sarcasm
---
Since when is kotaku a credible source of information?
---
Honestly a part of me wants that just so they can move to a not god awful engine, but the other part of me will miss all the stuff I own ingame that i worked for if we just move on from it ;_;
---
Did you listen to it. They said you can with build bit not equipment as it will break things.
---
I've been super curious and a bit confused reading this thread / the other one from yesterday.  Maybe I'm wrong, but from my point of view / skimming the patch notes I actually got buffed with this change.      
---
For clarification I don't play wvw often, mainly sPvP and some open world/fractals with it.      
---
For fractals it seems a non-issue with my playstyle, open world is faceroll with necro regardless, but in particular bumping up the number of players I can trigger my shade on in sPvP seems a huge unneeded boon rather than some sort of nerf.      
---
I've only played like 3 games since the patch but I've done basically on-par with what I was doing before damage wise and it even felt better in some mid fights (though that could be placebo).      
---
I'm genuinely kind of baffled that people didn't play around mobs/enemy players walking through their circles to begin with and aim/trigger accordingly.  Maybe I'm completely misunderstanding something?  Otherwise it's only good news for me.

Knock yourself out reading the comments discussing the same.
---
&gt; I wish Mo the best. GW2 may not live up to what I had hoped as a veteran of the series, but he's one piece of a triangle that created ArenaNet and now the original three founders are all left to history. I'll be watching the new studio with interest.
---
Agreed. While GW2 is a disappointment to me personally, and not a worthy successor to GW1, I still wish him the best and acknowledge their efforts.
---
One phrase that I think is being misspoken is "legendary gear is losing functionality". Unless I'm missing something, legendary gear isn't losing *any* functionality when templates come out. What it *is* losing is many of of its advantages that it had over *ascended* gear , namely storage storage space.
---
The reason various people acquired legendary gear was that they didn't enjoy having to carry 40 slots worth of gear with them on classes that they have many builds of. Now, both ascended and legendary gear will use essentially the same number of slots. Ascended armour/weapons also have an advantage over legendary armour/weapons in the fashion department, but that has been the case since forever. If you want your skins to change with every build you equip, then legendary armour has never been for you.
---
I think the MAIN issue with legendary armour compared to ascended armour stems when you transfer gear across characters. I personally do not do this since I like each character of mine having unique gear, but it *seems* like those that share their legendary armour, weapons, or trinkets across characters will now have one hell of a bad time.
---
Let's say my Chrono and my Elementalist both use the same set of legendary armour and I just transfer it via the bank whenever I need it. My Elementalist uses it for three different gear templates: power, condi, and heal. My Chrono uses it for six different gear templates: power, condi, power boon, condi boon,  tank, and WvW. Each gear template has a different assortment of runes and infusions.
---
Now, if I remove the legendary armour from the armoury of my Chrono to move it to my Elementalist, what happens? Six entire templates get screwed up. I'll move it to my Elementalist, and I'll have to manually slot it in to my power, condi, and heal templates by changing the stats and upgrades for each template. Then, when I move the legendary armour back, my six templates on the Chrono all have their legendary armour missing. I'll need to add it back in to all six gear template slots, changing the stats/upgrades to what they were before for each one.
---
It's just not feasible and a huge turn-off for players that transfer legendary gear around.
---
Somewhat related: When I was doing some napkin math on it, legendary armor sets are still worth it when factoring in stat infusions slots for 6 slots compared to making 6 ascended sets. Otherwise, yeah, the limit of 6 means it's cheaper to just make 6 ascended sets (including 1 or 2 with stat infusions).
---
Legendary weapons and trinkets are generally way more expensive than their ascended counterparts to the point you could make like 20 weapons instead (around 9 if doing stat infusions? would have to do the math). With templates, you're basically having their potential greatly limited and can use all the armor slots saved for more weapon variants I guess?
---
Doesn't mean that 6 is anywhere near enough for a pvxer or class with multiples roles per game mode, but something that could be interesting to really math out once I know the gem costs of this template stuff.
---
ok so why did they put the copy/paste right-click options to the equipment template tabs, if they didn't want you to use them?
---
I remember them showing that for the build section, but not equipment. I think I need to re watch it
---
&gt;I think Anet as a whole needs new blood to be put in control of the company/game
---
The "new blood in control" has been in control for years, it's the other Mike whose surname i keep forgetting \[sorry if you happen to be reading this Other Mike\].

---
No it's not, not at all.

But the Prologue is not an episode, so if they took that long for such a short prologue, something was done wrong.
---
They ALL got scrapped.
---
&gt; The thing about Season 4 (or 5) previously being "the end" of GW2 is that it was never communicated at all if that was the intention.

fuck this is a good comment. As a fellow magic player, your analysis of this is.... If a comment would have a taste, this one would be delicious.
---
They literally wrote it on the block post. And how would copy-paste of the template work? You make equipment with same skins as the one who gave you the template. No, equipment templates won't have a copy-paste functionality like skill templates.
---
......really dude? Have you not notice what has been happening?
---
GW3 (has a 3 in it) Half-Life 3 confirmed.
---
Yeah you could be right, i cant find any info about if equipment template copy/pasting is only for in game.
---
do you know where in the video they say you cant paste the data outside of the game?
---
&gt; Mo was in the preliminary stages of developing GW3.
---
the key part of that information and the one that answers your question is: the people that are leaving weren't working on gw2, therefor.. their departure has no impact whatsoever on gw2 or its future.
---
Hi Jessica, how's unemployment going for you?
---
There's also the fact that a member of the community came up with a way for us to conveniently save and load build/equipment templates and people have been using that for a while, now they are taking it away and replacing it with a lesser, more expensive version. So after years of begging for this feature, people finally gave up, the community made their own solution, and now they finally get around to it and it will cost an unreasonable amount of money and you will never reach the level of efficiency that the community build system did. That's shameful.
---
They barely it before and did it horribly more often than not, so it's a bit of a situation.
---
its not confirmed what he was working on was gw3, just that whatever it was could have turned into a gw3.
---
Yeah... damn, I blocked out Tabula Rasa from my memory.
---
imagine being called number 1 drama commander but still being terribad at the game. But tbh, fsp is dead so dont lie :)
---
&gt;actively engage with the community.
---
PR, cherry-picked answers and Quaggans is "actively engage with the community? If you want someone who actively engages the community, look at FFXIV's director who writes on the forums himself, writes an article on a gaming magazine and constantly logs into the game so have fun with the players.
---
Even if some sympathized with GamerGate, are we sure their arguments were nothing more than based upon which faction they belong to? MO said "hear everyone out", which is a reasonable approach. JP and others appearently left the meeting because some of those voices were somehow associated with GamerGate? Like, wat?
---
Tribalism is a fucking plague on discussion culture.
---
Schreier's reportage on Anthem earlier this year was the first instance of actual journalism on Kotaku's part in a while. For the most part they pull stuff out of their asses so often they might as well be Taimi's krew.
---
3rd possible reason: Anet was diverting time away from a dying game to try and develop something new, NCSoft stepped in and reminded them that GW2 is a cash cow filled with dedicated whales who will pour money into this game without a second thought regardless of how slimy their tactics are. They fired a bunch of people and made it clear to those remaining that the directive is to focus on the GW2 gemstore.
---
It's a possibility at least...
---
You dont need to play on lowest.
---
You can definitely turn up a lot of the settings to high and have almost no performance loss.
---
Character model settings have the highest impact, followed by reflections, shadows and render sampling. The rest barely affect the framerate for me.
---
Update: [This is how I fix the problem](https://i.imgur.com/LdaLksX.png)
---
&gt; reframe the official forums, and just talk to people as their daily job.
---
Don't gotta do that when they have extremely trigger-happy mods on the forums that remove anything too negative about the game.
---
They could've tried that WITHOUT diverting most of their devs off of GW2 tho.
---
Yeah it says you can copy/paste from one tab to another, so your probable right that its in-game only.
---
i wasn't talking about sharing links with others, i was more interested if you could create your own equipment templates and then store them externally for your own personal use.
---
The fact that the majority of their releases are outfits and mount skins and other gemstore crap isn't enough?
---
when devs have the perfect solution right in front of them but decide to rather come up with their own unproven shit just to not be copycats or whatever. 
---
It's so sad that in our current society these social barriers are blocking off actual proven reliable quality solutions.
---
Problem A: Style [Harder to implement]
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dbru90/please_give_us_transmutation_templates_as_well/
---
Problem B: Gear blueprints [way easier to implement]
---
It was longer than some of the previous LS releases. Have you even played it? It was a fully fledged episode sans new season currency.
---
I agree with this. Also I feel this argument of people who “invest more in the game” can be a little backwards. Those of us (myself included) who play a ton are certainly the ones who are benefiting the most from its continued development. It does stand to reason that we should financially support it more than those who only play a little. 
---
In the other hand, I think monetizing build templates completely sucks. Gear load pits, fine, but not builds.
---
thanks for the service.
---
i hope tournament happens wvw now
---
So, they are spoiled children instead. Always demanding for more and more, still not happy.
---
_Potentially_ working on GW3.
---
game is fine for now.
---
This may be a blessing in disguise. A GW2 would have been as successful as Ultima Online 2 or Everquest Next, unless they allowed you to carry your progress and all gemstore purchaes to the next title.  
---
While GW1 had very few unlocks, GW2 has a much more massive progression. Few players would give it up for a new game just for story or a different mechanics in an engine that may not even have better performance than GW2's. 
---
ANet needs to focus on improving the game both old outdated content and engine performance, and maybe add 'side-by-side' projects that work with the game, like a standalone mobile, desktop and console game to play activities old and new like keg brawl and polymock, that has crossplay with the full PC game.
---
This is why blocking someone else should also ALWAYS prevent you from continuing to message them.
---
Don't like the content just play something else. LMAO ^/s
---
Yep, Delta said if an official build template is released, Arc's template feature will be removed from future updates. Arc itself as DPS meter probably continue as normal.
---
To be completely blunt, nothing of value has been lost. 
---
I'm familiar enough with the internal workings of ArenaNet to know that the real creative genius from the founding team died when Jeff Strain left back in 2008. Mike O'Brien took Guild Wars 2 down the path of a conventional MMO with a poorly conceived business model and little trace of the traits which made Guild Wars such an excellent and original title. 
---
Mike O'Brien's friendship with Gaile Gray is the reason that Guild Wars persisted with such weak community management. Yes, she turned up in Lion's Arch and did the silly events where she pretended to be a frog, but placating the community with niceties is just a tiny part of the job. It was *always* up to the game designers themselves to reach directly into the community for the valuable feedback they needed, bypassing the community team.
---
The thing that stands out most is how he made brutal and sweeping decisions relating to how the community would be managed post GW2 which were clearly completely ignorant of how his game's community worked.
---
I'll keep banging this drum forever: Guild Wars 2, pre-launch, had the most *outstanding* community of passionate creators, capable moderators and administrators, and friendly members. This *evaporated* when Guild Wars 2 launched the official forums, which sucked all of the oxygen away from the fansites and then slowly turned into a cess-pit of negativity. It was the most moronic move I've ever seen a developer make.
---
"Fuck off" isn't an insult though.
---
Feels like they refused to fire or hire anyone. They're a bunch of friends, many not particularly skilled or top of their fields, and everything takes a long time because they're learning as they go instead of bringing in people who know what they're doing.
---
Everybody, please do not research that word!
---
Thanks!
---
Presumably that was GW3, at least per Kotaku report
---
Sure know a place that sells a new setup for 150 gold ?
---
400 gems is $5.
---
Nice to see a change from templates though 🤣
---
This too! People should wait for release and then express their concerns.
---
I just found [this one here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Veteran_Jaguar_Queen) yesterday.
---
Over 30 map completions and it was the first time I saw her.
---
Did i say that? Or did i say you live in a bubble if you think everything is fine and the game isn't dying?
---
Reading comprehension not working today?
---
&gt; according to Kotaku
---
That's when you you have stopped.
---
ANet, with all their ressources, are not even capable to produce an equivalent to something that has been done by someone totally alone. Plus, they're making players pay for it, while preventing the usage of the free alternative.
---
I fail to see by what mental gymnastics you're defending ANet and calling rightly outraged people "spoiled children".
---
You don't need to theory craft, just grab whatever is recent and it should run the game perfectly fine. GW2 is 7 years old.
---
I love how the guild wars 2 community has clamored for templates since the game's release, and now that we're finally getting it we have people complaining about it. It's not even out yet, let's just see how well it works for us first before we nitpick it.
---
Given how its CPU constrained (and not really multithreaded) any system with a high speed Intel chip and a midrange GPU will do. I'd say an i5 to avoid system interfering, but that's about it really. 
---
But as with all games, it depends in what resolution you're after.
---
That’s the front.
---
&gt;ERP - no ArenaNet support
---
&gt;Some beetle sheningans...
---
The game doesn’t support swapping builds? This is one of the few games that allows you to constantly swap your spec without having to pay a certain fee. Build templates is just a QoL feature. It doesn’t just magically enable swapping builds all of a sudden.
---
You need a high frequency cpu. Gw2 use only one core and don't use a lot youre gpu
---
You can spend 10k on a pc, and this game will still run like crap.
---
I don't agree, if you buy a pc with a cpu with a lot pf core and a low frequency (am cpu), you're likely to have low performance.
---
Why continue the argument about something hypothetical? We are arguing about build templates in the current state of GW2.
---
Bojler eladó
---
ahh mammon.. the arch nemesis of all gamers
---
Archage comes out in two weeks ;)
---
You have to look at the bigger picture.
---
The revenue earnings has been dropping rapidly and is already below WildStar levels when they were hit.
---
We also know that MO was working on "new projects", which were most likely mobile like with other big titles, and those have been canned now.
---
NCSoft is preparing to wind down. It is only a matter of time, unfortunately.
---
There isn't much utility in getting pedantic on this, since we generally agree, but that's one if the things I mean by "server architecture". It's not like each player could have a set amount of disk space; you would just increase your disk space provisions. A "not enough space" limit like rivens (which I didn't follow since I only have one or two rivens) is probably something like someone made a table with 100 columns and stored an id for each riven in a column. They could then completely rewrite the data access code and write a conversion script to move it to a table with one riven per row and then just ask the database for all of the rows for a particular user id.
---
Again, this is me being pedantic and excessively technical. We generally agree, I'm just being more technically precise with what is likely to be the issue.
---
To counter my own point, there is a possibility that they have to limit data storage per character to help ensure nothing goes wrong when you connect to a shard.
---
I think if he had not used the word dude it would probably been read in another way.
---
Thats not content. Its just measures to stretch out content. Oldest trick in the book.
---
Did it work for you?
---
&gt; People with legendary armor arent changing their fashion with every stat swap anyways.
---
Mainly because we can't.
---
I forget what path it is, but that laser jumping section is a nightmare.
---
are you posting to demand upvotes? do you ever think before you press enter, just curious
---
Agreed, there are lots of ways that could have been modified in text to make it clearer that wasn't sarcasm.
---
OK guys thanks, d912pxy did the thing and Im currently maxed with 70 fps :)
---
The biggest problem for me is that I use my heavy legendary armor across multiple characters (condi ren/alac ren/heal ren, condi, power quickbrand, support firebrand, condi BS, power BS, etc.). With Arcdps templates this is quick and easy. With the ANet templates it seems that to get my legendary armor back into my inventory to share across characters I'd need to empty my equipment templates. 
---
So...to get the most out of my legendary items' flexibility I have to give up the most convenient part of the template system and manually swap stats/runes all the time?
---
Fuck me.
---
Would it be better if legendary armor, runes, and weapons would be an account wide unlock? So they could be used on multiple characters for their builds. Would that justify the cost?
---
What’s the difference?
---
oooOOOOOoooH Cursing and spelling mistakes. How much where you shaking with anger while you typed this to a random person on the internet?
---
🙃
---
Lol, citing kotaku
---
You can do it at any fractal tier, and people can get downed or defeated and still get it.
---
If you are not getting it while all reactors are up and linked to Arkk, there may be a bug.
---
Templates...
---
=). Happens.  But your right with the lasers being annoying. I’ve seen people drop groups when they can’t pass it.
---
I am actually really excited to see what he comes up with next.
---
Guild wars is in good hands, so no worry there. Just more quality games for us
---
Its not worth the hassle for me to swap off my raid DPS build for most content. If i could do it with the press of one button instead of manually changing gear, traits, and utilities, i would be more likely to use a different build for other content, like open world or fractals.
---
Likely got hired back when people valued merit over your political views.
---
Ironically the cancel culture that people like JP are so happy to pursue and promote, ended up catching up to her. 
---
Who would've seen it coming?
---
With that meal, he won't be needing that tp
---
But, if it makes you feel better. I did some reading up on things and I get why you more hardcore players are angry, sadly I think Anet is not gonna budge from their stance and it only saddens me to see people get so angry and pissed off at something they should've seen coming from a mile away.  
---
Did people really think Anet was not gonna come with the bare minimum AND monetize it while they were at it?
---
I'll have her try it out, she has some trouble with direction so maybe that will help. I like to hold right click so I can shoot and run circles around bigger enemies personally.
---
By "slump" I don't mean the game is bad or doing bad, it is still one of the Big 5 mmo's. But what I do mean is the stagnation basically everyone who has been playing since HoT has been noticing. The best way to see that is to look up the financial earnings of GW2 via NCcrap's record releases. While stagnation in income is typically a normal thing, unlike most games like WoW or LoL (pre s8), GW2 stagnation started literally less than a year after its prime after HoT and has stayed that way since, ever so slowly getting smaller each year since PoF. On top of that you start to see dedicated veterans leaving the game and the community splitting over issues like this one.   
---
The current schedule for living story is officially around 3 months, more in between 2-4 depending on the size of the content drop. The gem store items in the game have been numerous recently, discounts being small and short lived. If you have ever seen games that rely on sales of their premium store for most of their monetization, then the track record leads to the unsustainable need to grow the cash shop until the player base can no longer support it. It can act as a short term crutch if a studio needs it, but not really anything beyond that.  
---
Look at War Thunder, Pay Day 2 (rip), Planetside 2, about 50% of all early access games and about 99% of mobile games. Once they fully lean on that cash shop they don't tend to do so well in the long run. ALL entertainment competes with each other to an extent. Every dollar spent on Untitled Goose Game or Spotify premium is a dollar they aren't putting into your product. Most of them just disappear or lose all of their players and move to China to lengthen that crutch period. People only have so much time and so many dollars.
---
Reminds me of American health care.
---
I've never managed to get an infusion, I don't have that kind of luck.
---
It will take a while and you are going to get board.
---
I would like to argue that build templates are not just a QoL feature, but at this point quite mandatory. Aside from Anet having always marketed their build diversity as a unique GW2 feature, the existence of legendary weapons, armour, trinkets and now runes means that a *lot* of people have at least 10 legendary stat swap windows to go through every time they want to change build. This also includes swapping runes and infusions.
---
It doesn't matter if the majority of the gamebase is casual and doesn't require build templates, or extra ones. Build templates were clearly not requested anywhere near as much by them, nor were they geared for them. They're not exactly the target audience here. 
---
What's the point in having almost full legendaries if their main pro (stat/rune/infusion swapping) because a massive, death-by-ui ballache? Also, why am I being punished for having gone through the effort of making a bunch of legendaries and learning a wide variety of builds by having to now spend what is going to be a lot of money, when build templates was a feature geared for players like me?
---
Ah, I didn't pay attention. I assumed they were account wide for each character
---
The average player isn't the target audience for build templates. It was predominantly the more hardcore player base asking for build templates, because they needed them.
---
Yeah amd fix that recently, but some year ago, most of amd cpu had lower frequency compare to intel cpu
---
Their monetization is going to be the same as GW. One time purchase + cosmetic item shop.
---
It sounds like the biggest mistake ANet has made was allowing Arc to release a templete function.
---
We had the financial reports, we know.
---
Is this the GW2 version of THAT dress?
---
Legendary armor costs 10-20x the amount of gold as Ascended armor.  A lot of players got it for the convenience or not having to carry around 6+ sets of ascended armor.  If this system were in place from the start, it would have been cheaper and easier to get 6 sets of ascended armor and have the extra 800g than craft legendary.
---
Honestly - both of you are right. 
---
For example if you play Sylvari personal story you will learn that there is another Sylvari community and another Tree west of the known maps, and you will send an NPC back there. But when you finally go to that mysterious west in HoT, no such things will be found. So - racial personal story was never used again, never referenced, depending on which part of the story is more important one may even conclude that racial personal story is not part of official storyline. 
---
Then again - your mentor from Orders of Tyria part of storyline was referenced in HoT. No other quest from that part, not even your choice of "lesser race to befriend" was ever referenced again.
---
Dude, I'm not being funny, but a community member did this for free out of his fucking basement, stop acting like its some massive undertaking instead of a pretty basic feature in 2019. The current cap for free templates (or there being a cap at all) is an abhorrent cash grab designed to milk the remains of the hardcore community until it collapses due to Anet's mismanagement of its game modes.
---
Yes, in my opinion. I currently get to do this with Arcdps build templates and that's the biggest thing I'm losing with the new system :(
---
That's not even remotely true, that was an unsubstantiated claim from a WildStar dev that was speaking on hearsay. Most of the developers still hang around, and the slides from the pitch they gave to NCSoft are public.
---
What happened was that they pitched City of Heroes 2, which would've been a rebuild of the engine with the existing content, bringing players over from the first game, and adding new progression systems without the cruft of the Cryptic Engine 1.0. The slides don't mention if they would re-license the newer version from Cryptic or what.
---
When they didn't secure that funding, because rebuilding a game that is making money is basically burning money, they took their concepts and launched City of Heroes: Freedom.
---
took me a while to figure out the tail
---
No u 
---
(This sub is high quality debate)
---
She got in an argument with a player over a complaint about the writing, rather than doing what everyone else was doing on July 4th and ignoring it to spend time with family and friends.
---
The next day, once everyone returned to the office, she was fired. Now she claims it was because Reddit bitched about it when it's already been publicly aired that the decision wasn't made till the day after the 4th of July *because everyone else was with family and friends*. She didn't learn a valuable lesson that you can't publicly talk about being part of a business and then misrepresent them. But, gaming "news" sites gave her a platform, because insufferable assholes gets clicks. (See: On-going Randy Pitchford and Gearbox press)
---
Pretty sure now they would pay anet to not release "templates".
---
Have another look at the WS earnings when they were hit with major layoffs and then compare that to GW2's recent earnings (keep inflation over several years in mind with this).
---
B&amp;S and Aion still earn a lot more than GW2.
---
You have to consider expenses relative to earnings and we know that Anet has been excessively bloated - still more than 200 staff (doing what?).
---
You are not at all wrong in your assessment though and yes, the Western market is highly important, but how important, when GW2 earnings is already less than 5% of mobile earnings?
---
Ok let's see if this work: I'd pay lot of money for a new xpac and elite specializations!
---
DOOOM!
---
You are right, I got carried away by the titles a bit. Cision tho goes into a bit better detail and kinda makes it sound like the CDO will be an "overlord" of ANET rather than president, because he now manages multiple titles and looks broader on NCSOFT.
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/List\_of\_PvE\_and\_PvP\_versions\_of\_skills](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/List_of_PvE_and_PvP_versions_of_skills) 
---
Significant portions of skills were removed to the point where the skill functioned differently, same basic effect but it's nothing outside the realm of potential here. As removing portions of skills like gw1 did would significantly unbreak a skill for pvp but be fine if left as it was for pve. Shades are an example of this as they don't need to do 50 things in pvp to be good but for pve they do.
---
In terms of scrapper, they could simply add back chem field as part of the skill and make detection pulse a piece of it in pve. It's all do-able and they did drastic things like this in gw1, if i had the time there is a mesmer skill that was entirely different in function for a time between pvp and pve (can't remember what though, but it should be in the skill change log for that ability).
---
&gt; I'm looking at the LFG tool and theres no one doing any dungeons
---
They fill up *super* quickly. Put a group up yourself.
---
No it's not. I am giving you the perspective of someone who is not hardcore (like 80% of the playerbase) and saying that a large part of the playerbase does not care. So my input is anything but irrelevant, you only think it's irrelevant because you are convinced that there are only hardcore players like yourself.
---
This is why I just shake my head every time I read these types of threads.
---
So much concentrated, upvoted stupidity. Doom, gloom, conspiracy, apocalyptic bullshit from people who have no idea how businesses work, and are just looking for the juiciest drama-filled explanation for their current "woes". 
---
God damn, how I wish this sub was more interested in playing the game than bitching about it.
---
Steal one from NASA.
---
Posts like this miss the point entirely. I made a more complete post about this here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dcijao/why_im_so_worried_about_the_build_template/
---
But suffice it to say, I'm happy to pay for some aspect of this system, but currently we're getting triple monetized -- account storage, character build template slots, and character equipment template slots. On top of this, the system we're being offered is in many respects a downgrade to what many of us have been using for a while. 
---
Will I pay for some equipment storage system? Sure. Will I pay for it if it also has account bound storage features? Fuck yes!
---
Will I pay through the nose to get a small number of build storage slots that I could just as easily keep on a text file on my computer? Hell no. Am I content with only 6 build/equipment template slots? Also no, there's a lot to this game, and if you participate in multiple areas of it, you need more slots, hard stop.
---
If you want to do dungeons, just list and say that you are a new player. They aren't many listings because they fill up fast and then go away. Naturally prime time will be better since there will be more people looking.
---
Did she get fired?
---
&gt; Dude, I'm not being funny,
---
No, you're just being stupid if you honestly believe that hacking a game's memory from outside can actually be shipped as an official stable, reliable, supportable solution.
---
Woah, the highest voted comment is the one mocking you. That's reddit or gw2 community for ya.
---
How long have you followed this subreddit? I guess to understand current notions and mood of the community one would have to summarize last year or even last two years.
---
My (still limited, as I was not a member from the start of GW2) understanding and answers to your questions:
---
- whole fiasco is about quality of life features being heavily monetized, with each year GW2 undergoes heavy influx of paid "content", not everyone is happy about this
---
- game is not dying, at least in the meaning that you will probably be able to still play it for several more years. However development of the game may be scarce and not as polished as many people claim it was "back in the day" (again, "back in the day" I was not playing GW2 yet, so your mileage may vary)
---
- game is still popular enough and brings enough revenue in market with withering competition, that you can expect it to run for several more years, as I already said. If you mean "developer support" as in new big updates and features - I don't think so, those will probably die out within a year or so. If dev support for you means that someone will flip the switches to enable seasonal events (like halloween, christmas etc.) then such thing can still be expected for many years to come
---
It is said she left on her own during lay offs
---
I'd pay many gems to ... know everything about the 2 dropped projects of the layoffs, about the project that was started by MO and the 7 other people who leave the company together, the ongoing projects aside from LS5 (related or not to gw2) and their actual plans for the future of the game beyond LS5.
---
People expected more. Build templates was no.1 requested feature since forever, to the point that even an addon was created with that functionality. Now it finally comes to the game and not only is it heavily monetized but it only gives 6 slots per character which is absurdly low for people who will use it the most.
---
On a side note, it was supposedly being "worked on" since 2017. One can only guess why did it take so long, and how tangled is GW2's code.
---
Certainly between 2004-2012 the vast majority of the community management workload was carried by fansites.
---
Dear God, if only there were more hardcore players, maybe the game wouldn't be stagnating quite so much. Not entirely sure where you got that assumption from, but keep assuming I guess lol
---
I know what your perspective is, I've seen it a lot over reddit lately. I'm happy for you that this doesn't affect you and you can look forward to build templates, but once again, the people who build templates were primarily geared towards are very *unhappy*, and that's what we're here to discuss. Your input of "but it's fine for casuals like me!" isn't very relevant because you're not the main audience for build templates. You're still free to have your opinion.
---
What an odd thing to say.
---
So... you're saying your sentence canceled itself out?
---
I quit gw2 right after path of fire released because the game felt different.
---
vanilla gw2 and even HoT will always be in my heart as probably my favorite gaming experience of all time, right there with ultima online.
---
but I just feel like this game is done.  I hate to say that but I feel it
---
Thanks.
---
&gt; Supposedly it weighs 5.1 ounces. 
---
It may sound crazy, but 5.2 ounces is a huge weight compared to my current mouse. My current mouse is 3 ounces. Going back to a mouse of that weight is really difficult :/
---
&gt; As far as classes I go I think necro or ranger are the easiest to play with. Either reaper or soulbeast specifically. Since your pets can take Aggro and do some damage. 
---
Thanks, I'll definitely be looking into these 2! People have linked some great builds that I'm just about to try out :D
---
Of course there are people complaining. From the looks of it, the system has severe limitations and is generally a downgrade from the existing 3rd party solution. But it is paid. Erm... Should I be happy about that?
---
Builds and gear templates are different.
---
Do you have more than 6 unique sets of gear on both of those characters? No? Then you're covered. 
---
The people who are going to be negatively affected by this are people who are so hardcore that, for instance, they min-max precision depending on their party composition, and they want all of those different compositions saved in their build templates. **That** is the kind of tiny gear swaps that these people do, and currently with arcdps they don't have to remember which pieces they swap in which situations. 
---
If you just have, like, a power set, a condi set, and a healing set...you'll be fine.
---
Yes that'd be my best guess too. The 6 only is a technical limitation of some sort, and they developed the account storage knowing full well 6 wouldn't cut it for some. Can't see any reason why anyone would come out his way with such a system if there was nothing keeping him from just stacking slots on character.
---
Your flair sure checks out.
---
Look it's a great idea in theory. I just hope you don't get your hopes up on all the in-depth stuff you post.
---
Wow
---
So you have some sort of programming-related job, much like Anet devs? I'm sorry that sometimes your job is hard, like anybody else's, but that's not really an valid excuse now, is it? You can decorate the process of making build templates as much as you want, but it's not exactly the new pinnacle of gaming technology. Stop white knighting Anet devs out of doing their jobs. We weren't asking for some 2050 tech here, we were asking for a feature that was included in this games fucking predecessor, that a dude built in his basement, for free.
---
I agree. As i have all legendary equipment that you can get (armor/all guard weapons/runes/sigils/backpack/ring and earrings) I feel cheated to pay just for a gear slot. Maybe they should charge the slots within gear templates. I really dont know...The think I know is that Anet should either let us use more than 6 gear templates or let us still use arc templates. The current system as presented is lacking severely and I kind of hate it. :/

---
Why can't we have a system like a bank tab where to throw in all items, sigils, runes and the equipment templates can access it from there? Then all is in one place...
---
Cheeki Breeki
---
Tbh its What People always said to add and be willing to pay for. At least they giving some for free, or else just stick to old same old inventory.
---
I dont think they Will force the templates as much as we think. At the end of the day, what messed up is the Whole "roles" thing or go away that have players running the same thing for x class across all players.
---
Now if all builds type were viable this wouldnt be an issue at all besides some tweaks.
---
Oof.
---
I personally prefer the account storage over the loadouts cause they are actual templates :) That being said, a reason to use them could be to quickly transfer a build from one character to another for example. I could for example store a build for my weekly keyfarm character in there (that tome to lvl 80 cause of the other keys later in the story). Or i simply have multiple chars of a certain class.
---
Good bot, have an [apple cider]!
---
Ahh, that hit the spot.
---
Meanwhile, GW 1 with unlimited build templates...
---
It's the only real storage because the character slots are auto updated everytime you change anything.
---
There was something like this between GW1 and GW2. 
---
Collecting titles in GW1unlocked certain titles and cosmetic gear in GW2.
---
I'm not the suggest-a-tron, I'm the one that pulls the lever and spreads what comes out.
---
Once out there, it's out of my hands. It may happen or not, and if it happens at all, it may take years, like the recent GW1 updates done before the dev who made them left.  All things people requested for years.
---
It hurts even more to see that a lot of the community is now made up of braindead fanboys.
---
I didn't get the difference at first either.
---
I think (and of course my understanding might be wrong) the actual difference is this:
---
- Character bound: You directly change the template when switching stuff around
---
- Account bound: Skill/Trait Blueprint that doesn't get changed when loading it onto a character.
---
By their own admission (a Colin Johansen interview) they worked their butts off to make that happen, unsustainably hard. They didn't make gw2 because gw1 was working great _for them_.
---
Did someone say capes?
---
So... quality of life, right?
---
Well enjoy paying for a basic feature, then, I guess.
---
But can you find the content?
---
This is what happens when the PvP community has zero representation, zero structure, zero attention paid to it. 
---
Of course that's the same for the PvE community too... 
---
The PvP community in GW1 was awesome. Of course there were bad elements, but there was a widely recognised need amongst the more socially active players that courting new entrants to that format was necessary to stop competitive play stagnating.
---
&gt;running GW2
---
&gt;stable 60fps on most scenarios
---
Sorry to disappoint, but it aint gonna happen.
---
I have 6 raid builds and 4 wvw ones on my necro so yeah?
---
That's amazing. 
---
That kind of attitude is why Gaile never had the stones to go near the GW1 PvP community.
---
No im pretty sure most of us would have been fine if we could have kept using arc like we were already doing for the past 5 years.
---
What are the specs of the pc's the devs at ANet use?
---
If you play a character in all 3 modes you already had 3 builds. So you don't even gain anything at that point. You just have to press some extra buttons to switch now instead of auto switching when you enter the mode.
---
I am super excited too!
---
I rarely change my build after creating a character, but now I can create an alt template to many characters and change them on-the-fly with a simple hotkey. So many possibilities! Maybe my raid weaver gets a full magi set? Maybe my condi scourge gets a full magi set too? Maybe my power herald goes full healer too? No need to create new characters anymore!
---
Did you forget that most players dont use the forum?
---
Censoring it only makes it worse.
---
Let me tell you exactly how much of an icon Gaile Gray was in GW1:
---
She'd turn up in Lions Arch and do these ridiculous impromptu events where she pretended to be a frog, and basked in the attention she got from having purple text in the chat and being 'a dev'. 
---
Other than that, she briefly tried to interfere with how fansites were managed, briefly inserted her son into position as PvP community manager - with hilariously poor consequences, and let the game designers go out and seek their own player feedback through her own incompetence.
---
Yes, that was my point. Apologies if it came across any other way. 
---
Dungeon rewards are solid, but running them consistently for armor is not doable for most no players.
---
There still is. You can still play GW1 and unlock the titles and skins in GW2.
---
final GW2 patch literally "and then you wake up and it was all a dream" the end.
---
Jeff Strain leaving.
---
I was just thinking that.
---
Think more.
---
Thanks so muuuuch :D I mean I have the game. I bought it when it came out but never played it obsessivly. I was just asking cause I am going to buy it for a cousin and idk if its still worth it.
---
That is why we need twitch emotes in every social platform and online game.
---
Writing is on the wall but it's kind of blurry and far off. If you can squint you can see it getting slowly closer.
---
very, very true
---
He helped gaming more than he harmed it in the long run and will forever be memorialised for it.
---
No, not at all, and like I said in another comment, there are WAY more casual players not using the forums compared to hard-core players not using the forums. So the playerbase that use less than 6 templates is probably even bigger.
---
these memes of "the community" making fun of itself in favor of Anet's pockets seem more like the work of very dedicated salesmen at Anet than regular people playing the game
---
Generally speaking, the pve game is all about exploration, achievements, unlocking skins, trying out different stat sets for a different play style.
---
There are champions, bosses, legendary huge creatures but in most cases, if you got enough people fighting it, it wont need you to pull off some crazy rotation or combos.
---
Dungeons can be fun to explore, and farming their tokens can unlock some nice skins.
---
Fractal is the only place that requires a form of gear progression, but offers a larger challenge than dungeons
---
Raids offer much more punishing boss mechanics, and you need gear and practice to beat them. However with enough practice, people have been beating raids with less than 10 players, and less than optimal gear and builds.
---
I would say these are the stuff you can do from 1 to 80, and things you can do as a lvl 80 in core tyria, HoT and PoF zones.
---
Lvl 1-80
---
* map exploration, world bosses, events, learning about your skills and traits, discovering jumping puzzles and mini dungeons.
---
* playing trough personal story
---
* playing trough dungeon story line (which tells a story about a guild while your character is doing his story)
---
* beating dungeon story and finishing their explorable modes (tells a story about the state of the dungeon after the events of the story mode)
---
* daily activities
---
* weekly/annual events (haloween soon to come)
---
Note: dungeons are old 5man instanced content, and among other group content (fractals ,raids....the new strike missions?) is at the bottom of popularity.
---
Lvl 80 (core tyria)
---
* farming mats and gold, (various ways, there are even whole maps that are profitable by doing events) or even specific dungeons for specific exotic quality gear
---
* 100% map completion for a star on your name, a title, and 2x gifts of exploration used to craft legendary weapons
---
* trying out t1 fractals (most popular group content)
---
* Farming t1 daily fractals for various rewards and currencies and investing in ascendant quality gear
---
* further investing into ascendant gear and agony resistance infusions so you can play trough t2,3,4 of fractals.
---
* playing trough season 2 living world, doing its achievements for various rewards, including some gem shop items
---
* doing various achievements, they really do send you to all kinds of places and different things to do.
---
* maxing out core tyria masteries for extra fractal rewards, legendary precursor crafting as well as aoe auto loot
---
Lv80, heart of thorns
---
* fully unlocking your new elite spec, as well as its weapon collection for a free ascendant weapon
---
* various adventures
---
* full on meta event driven zones, non stop action,events, currencies, loot and rewards
---
* a new way of exploration with a glider
---
* max out all masteries, and be able to go into areas you previously couldnt survive in
---
* 10 man raids (they arent brand new anymore, people will expect you to be prepared for encounters)
---
* a brand new personal story line, with multiple choices, and differences between players race
---
* season 3 living world, features new whole zones per episode, with its own rewards and currencies , as well as masteries. Can also get a set of ascendant trinkets with swappable stats
---
* loads of new achievements
---
Lvl80, path of fire
---
* largest maps so far with a new personal story line with multiple choices
---
* new masteries, mostly mounts, absolutely needed for the new terrain
---
* less zone wide events than in HoT, but offers bounties, randomised boss monsters spawned by taking a bounty from the bulletin board.
---
* tons more of achievements ,some even lore heavy.
---
* season 4 offers a similar episode pattern, new zones, new rewards, new currencies, new masteries, but also new mounts even
---
They already said PvP builds aren’t coming yet, so that doesn’t count. And then it depends on if you play WvW enough to bother with a different build.
---
Treating it as a weird form of ng+ could work, but for MMOs... well. There's also a reason why MMOs are dying out and being replaced by games that take their good and addicting mechanics, but add something else from other genres (shooters, RPG) too.
---
This sounds great for all parties involved.
---
Thank you so much. Take a look.
---
Please tell me how did you install all these addons step by step
---
If you're interested, WoodenPotatoes just released a video 6 days ago on a thief build intended for story/open world: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws-PikNBi-o
---
The answer is literally in this thread.
---
I am not enough into ws to cover the whole thing but about the layoffs:
---
They didn’t necessarily happen because of gw2 earnings .. since at that point they were somewhat stable on a decent lvl .
---
What actually happened and it was even mentioned in the ncsoft earning report is , that the revenue across the board dropped and they had to make cuts on different points . 
---
You might be right that anet was one of these since they were bloated and working on 2 projects which were either risky or not promising .
---
One of these was probably a gw2 mobile game which theoretically could be successful, but ncsoft also knew about the Desaster that happened to blizzard with Diablo. So since gw2 is mostly just known in western markets where the denand for mobile mmos is rather low , they didn’t see a promising future fort the cost it took.
---
From my standpoint there is no actual indication for ncsoft to cut anything for gw2 since it should still have some actual earnings .
---
For now we are at the same revenue as 2016 where they actually allowed them to make new Xpac even when keeping inflation in mind
---
I will try to be there! Thanks for sharing, I usually hop in and out of HP trains and other trains over the weekend in HoT, but is nice to know when one is actively happening ahead of time so that I can plan!
---
It's a damn shame that community projects like this have never really been supported by ArenaNet. Thank you for your contribution.
---
What is that awful DE build? I'm guessing someone like WP shared that. The instant you come across an enemy that reflects, ccs a lot, or applies a lot of condis, your day is ruined.
---
If you really want to play a DE in OW and Story, I'd suggest [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PaxAQhjlNw8YdMJ2IW2XqPVA-e). You will also gain the benefit of perma-quickness from this (especially easy if you use diviner pieces), along with more than enough evades, condi clears, and stun-breaks. For boss fights, simply adjust the following: DE 112 &amp; Shadow Meld. For tons of AoE, either spam D/D 4 or swap the D/D to SB. Do not spam rifle 3...2 is better in most situations besides boss fights, where you should be kneeling and using 3(2) and stealth chaining for DJs.
---
For the DD, you want DA 2-3-2. Improv is a lot more useful...and with recent change, you shouldn't be opening with steal.
---
Omegalul, thanks for linking it
---
Settle based tech company, sounds about right.
---
Daredevil all the way, you still get to spam one button when you're lazy (22222222) but also have a bunch of versatility if you decide to actually start trying plus an extra dodge.
---
some anet dev leaked to kotaku that it was some early works that could end up as gw3.  
---
   
---
https://kotaku.com/source-departing-arenanet-president-was-working-on-pot-1838755217   
---
meaning that we wont get gw3, as people that was working on it left and took the toys
---
I'd say of entire mankind ;-)
---
This will just kill the topic and discussion tbh. It's good that it's getting attention, because it's a huge fuckup.
---
This sub is full of art and other stuff anyways that doesn't primarily have to do with playing the game.
---
I agree with you on this. Mike O'brien seems like the layoffs and the failure of the other new properties to launch. Maybe made his time much less enjoyable at Arenanet. I hope he finds that fun and passion again at his new studio.
---
Viper scourge, magi scourge, harrier scourge, zerk reaper, kiter scourge, zerk/cavalier scourge, gvg scourge scholar, gvg scourge eagle etc. They are all different.
---
Just because others don't have as many why do we have to get the reverse of a qol? Because this is just gonna make it all worse since I won't be able to use arc to change.
---
I was curious what [poll](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/88867/poll-build-templates) you were talking about and lmao that sample size is far too tiny to hold any significance
---
Also maybe it's just me but I feel like the players who might be more critical at less likely to be in the official forums which have time and time again been censored into a safe space. It's a population bias which influences the responses.
---
The "majority" of players are not active on any social media platforms for the game either most likely. They're just casual players who log in when they feel like it to play for a bit. This feature is more for the experienced players who would be utilizing it in multiple game modes or multiple gear builds.
---
China --&gt; Hong Kong is to Anet --&gt; Community
---
Quite literally would pay an expansion price for unlim.
---
I don't know if you're confused or what, but you end up passively endorsing paid gem tabs by casually implying that they're really not that big of a deal and that "players" are being unreasonable in their demands. "I won't buy them but I think it's ridiculous how everyone has such a big problem with them" is warming your audience up to the idea of paying for gem tabs. it's a salesman tactic. it's also something many people often do without thinking. what I'm saying is I hope that you'll think about what a change will bring before you minimize and generalize others' reactions it.
---
So, for OP, few comments/statements/upvotes here on reddit and even less on the official forum (often the same guys behind the screen) = the whole GW2 community ?
---
well ... they did share a pack with authorized assets, guidelines and so on. I used it back then, it contains the images that Scarlet used as a base to create the top banner and the main background. Anet's stuff is also the reason for their copyright text, the "community site" mention in the title, and the gw2 logo placement : all comply to their mandatory rules. To this say, I still wonder if anyone else complied to those rules ...
---
So how is your gw2radial dll named?
---
GWM: DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE PHONES!?
---
Could always try [PP Condi](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pulsating_Pestilence) [Herald](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/True_Nature_\(demon\)). 
---
Ok, sure it's a meme, and that grandmaster trait that applies torment when you gain resistance is better. Honestly though there's nothing more fun then letting a condi thief try desperately to do literately ANYTHING to you while you just stand around and spam resistance building up conditions just to send it all back.
---
We don't know.
---
The headline says 'potential Guild Wars sequel', which is accurate according to the source. How is that clickbait?
---
Probably the same it have now, since Mike is still the game director.
---
We have yet to see the full consequences of the restructuring and new focus on the game since the icebrood saga just started, but for now it felt kinda promising.
---
Still... I wouldn't be surprise if we see a bit more aggressive gestore, like the build templates for example, in favor of ditching xpacs totally.
---
They can't just 'take the toys' with them, it's almost certainly NCSoft's property and they'd get sued into oblivion.
---
Ignore the posts.
---
... read the other comments lol
---
As a programmer myself I can understand how complex a few builds can go if the number is too high. Not just storage-wise but also UI design. The design currently is overwhelmed with stuff, add 20 more buttons and it becomes a mess that new players won’t even understand (“should i use all this, why is there otherwise? Am I playing wrong?, etc”). Anet probably had to make quite some analysis to both of those 3 things. If it changes it will probably be delayed X months and I don’t want that either.  
---
On top of those 3 reasons (storage, UI design and new players perception) I honestly feel this game is more casual than hardcore, and the breach between casuals and hardcore gamers should be lowered, not increased. This is quite a debatable topic but each day the breach is larger and I feel having more templates would add another layer of complexity. (Full run, 300lis, 8templates) etc. If Anet keep the number low, chances are everyone is on the same standard (with rare exceptions).
---
Valid discussion ended 24h after, now it's a circlejirk
---
Haha yeah it’s gonna be fun! I have a necromancer and started off back in the day with an axe main which I thought was super cool. Then eventually I found an awesome staff so switched to that, and then Reaper gave me a greatsword so I haven’t been back to the axe or daggers or anything else in so long and I’d really like to! I’m looking forward to having the option to be able to switch based on what I feel like rather than clogging up my inv with equipment that I like but probably won’t ever use lol.
---
I know you are, but what am I!
---
infused items shared for all alts, ulimited, free up inventory slots: this is what I would be glad to spend for
---
Scientifically speaking it's not 100% noise because it does contain information and additional view points. Trying to bog this movement down and getting it tangled up in meta discussions hurts the playerbase.
---
Anet can't be moved to change their fucked up system by organized statements that contain zero pressure to fix problems. Pressure is good.
---
Exactly, imagine a writer writing a trilogy, and getting bored at the second book.
---
Commitment to the project is the minimum requisite you need to be leading, and I feel like many at ArenaNet don't have what it takes for that.
---
Nothing wrong with that, they just chose the wrong genre to work at. MMOs are like children, you can't spend just three years and abandon them whenever you get bored.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they discontinued GW1 just because of the same reasons, and I wouldn't be surprised if NCSOFT was not willing to let them throw their game away once again.
---
Because it has to be considered in the database design. You simply can't implement a feature without considering how it will impact both the current and future state. Huge mistake not to.
---
Don't worry you already have your RES tags as a shill. :)
---
Could you show me the research publication of the science you mention?
---
Carbine had other problems, mostly pointing at their launch window of Wildstar.  The game had a relatively weak launch and player retention due to the design philosophy of the game, leading to them having problems keeping subscriptions going.  This lead to content getting pushed aside for a bit while they tried to fix the progression issues that was causing them to hemorrhage players... which in turn meant little new content was coming out to keep players interested in the game.  By the time Wildstar went F2P the damage was done to a pretty large degree, people have already been laid off, ect.  And while they were able to survive for a while the game simply wasn't populated and profitable enough
---
Thier main issue was they took a "Harcore raiding or bust, and hardcore skill-based PvP" approach to an MMO.  Now, bringing back Burning Crusade style raiding wasn't a problem (in fact it's a huge benifit), the issue was the "or bust" approach, basically the game had nothing to offer casual players.  Even the content that was meant to be run more casually (which was repetitive and dull) still couldn't be enjoyed casualy because it requried you to perform content perfectly in order to get gear upgrades, so people left as soon as a single mistake was made.  Dungeons too, you didn't get useful gear unless you finished said dungeons under certain times meaning you had to speedrun their dungeons, which took a lot of fun out of what were legitimately the most fun dungeons I've ever seen in an MMO.  The raiding was great, but focusing all their attention on something only about 1-5% of players got to touch... didn't work out well.  They basically had the opposite problem that GW2 has, and unfortunately pissing off the casual playerbase means far more players leaving.  Oh, and their PvP just turned out to be spammy, chaotic, and kinda dumb.
---
There is very little actual discussion happening. A discussion would involve thinking about the issue and trying to understand the motivations of all parties involved. Most people are just screaming into the crowd about how terrible this outcome is without accepting any counter arguments because "BUT THIS WAS FREE".
---
Well, you can't change that by yelling a lot, let's discuss what you think should happen moving forward!
---
It's kind of like how with mobas there just isn't a whole lot of room. You can probably name three successful MOBAs, those being league, Dota and......maybe Smite?
---
Basically, just because there aren't a lot doesn't mean they aren't saturated. Most people these days don't have the time for more than one MMO, and MMOs have become less and less appealing as even single player games start to have online communities and environments. In addition, MMOs by nature require a lot of investment from the player, it's much harder to convince for example a FFXIV player whose played since launch to suddenly jump on WoW.
---
Finally, MMO development is just a lot of risk. They aren't cheap, they aren't easy, they require constant maintenance, and they're becoming less and less relevant than the golden days of Everquest and early WoW.
---
This would be great. As a fairly fresh 80, trying to take in as much info as I can about the game, seeing these constant complaints is a bit disheartening. The community in game is awesome in my experience, but coming here is just... such a negative experience.
---
And I'm honestly happy for you for that :)
---
See: if they just leave the old add-on available for veterans we could all be happy :)
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_noise
---
We can stay superficial for now with wiki? Because I'm not doing this professionally. 
---
Noise would be my "bullshit", which annoyed you (rightly so).
---
Been plenty of times in WvW where I've thought "hey that fight was pretty damn hard because he was so good!"...
---
... only to get a barrage of... colorful... whispers.
---
They will ban it, that's the problem.
---
If they leave arc template available for "advanced users" this would not be a problem
---
Fun fact: Wikipedia was determined by *some study* to be about as reliably verified as traditional encyclopedias, if not a little more. People have been making shit up since the beginning of speech, it's not new that false stuff gets published.
---
It's funny because "Psychological noise" is argument exactly against teh circle jerk that is happening here, regarding build templates.
---
That wasn't what I meant, but I know I wasn't very clear with what I meant. It wasn't the most ambitious or serious post from my end.
---
That it is just speaking about Living World rather than GW2 as whole (after he alluded to the original vision of GW2), can be seen as MO taking a dig at what he was afforded to do by parent/situation, or as what he expects from the future (either as positive or negative in his eyes) or it could be me overanalyzing that mere snippet of a long press release :).
---
Haha thanks for the build
---
&gt; Yeah, they should probably actually come out and talk to us about why these decisions were made.
---
Man, that would be nice. As I said before, understanding them doesn't change that it's bad. But understanding them means we have more sympathy on a personal level. And maybe can direct our disappointment (there sure are better words for that, but...) at upper / middle management and the industry with their fucking mtx.
---
Again, if they wanna make money, they have to make a good product first. Ball is in their court, not ours.
---
I want a good product. This ain't it.
---
Username doesn't fit.
---
And fucks me with multiple ascended sets, as I need 10 gear templates to switch between 10 items with the same skin
---
&gt; Being a fairly decent size dev studio and only working on one game is really bad for business/their portfolio. You want to slowly work on other projects and see if anything pans out to expand your studio. I don't blame Anet for trying but you don't move like 50-60% of your dev team off your main product to do it. You can move some devs to spearhead the project but you really should hire new people(which they also did) and place them on new stuff.
---
This is the bingo answer tbh.  As a company you want to expand into other projects.  BUT as a company running an MMO, a genre of game that lives and dies on content and content releases, pulling hands off of that project to work on other stuff is basically suffocating yourself.  All of those teams should have been 100% in on GW2, crafting content, reshaping existing content, etc.  Hire new people and have them develop entirely new projects.  
---
But hey, who am I to judge lol just an armchair dev here XD
---
The one thing you haven't been told yet is that you are not getting anything for free.
---
You already have 3 "templates" it's just right now they are linked to three different modes (pve spvp wvw). So technically you're losing those and getting the new ones. Funny thing is, right now it automatically swaps when you change game modes, in the future you better remember to do it manually.
---
So... Yeah you're actually getting nothing that you haven't got and most casual players are getting a new hassle that they never had before.
---
And of course the vets are getting shafted. 
---
But you know how this is, if the company insists on shafting paying customers, they stop paying.
---
I'm only half joking. I know wiki is good, I know it has its problems that only tangentially touch the quality of its content.
---
Problem with the site I linked and why I am half joking now is that there's so little information, not more than an overview.
---
Your post reads to me like, "I get that we can try to understand what happened, but I really just would prefer to be angry because my precise demands weren't met."
---
You are still blaming management and ignoring any possibility that it could actually be a technical limitation/impracticality to provide what you are asking for.
---
It's a bit late for a "no u" kid.
---
Coz they can't guarantee the safety of the items, too many combinations of variables that could lead to loose / delete an item and that would affect _all your build / alts_ instead of just one. A volcano of bugs.
---
"i only find bad players therefore your sound and logical argument is not valid, necro is good!!!!!!!!!!!"
---
To be fair, it's probably similar to how you can speak to an animal with the most horrific words/insults/etc, but if you're saying it in a sweet cutesy tone, the animal won't care.  Like you said, the emoticon is basically helping convey the tone regardless of the words being used.
---
I mean, you resorted to a) just attacking me and b) using derogatory terms, so I thought I would go ahead and try to communicate with you on your level.
---
Honestly, I would get an AMD 3600/3600x, 16gb of 3200+ RAM (higher the speed the better), and a GTX 1660ti/2060 (Im out of touch on midrange GPUs so there may be better options now). There is wiggle room to upgrade higher or make other changes, but this will get you really far. The most important thing is also use the DX12 mod to get the most out of this build. 
---
During superpopulated metas and WvW trains you will not maintain 60 fps, but nothing will. This will maintain &gt;60 in most situations and perform admirably during the high-stress portions.
---
Yea, a statement like that without a smile emoji sounds more like sarcasm TBH. not saying the guard reacted appropriately, but a simple ":)" goes a long way in PVP.
---
Everyone who mains one class in several game modes has more than 3 builds. Not everyone is like you.

#KAPPA
---
You want me to pay for equipment "slots" templates? Then they should be _sharable between alts_. 
---
So I get the QoL improvement of easy transfer and less inventory clutter.
---
If putting gear into a template prevents me to share it _I don't buy it_
---
Well certainly. The only problem is the assumption that the casuals actually pay anything aside from maybe the xpacs
---
That weed must have been good.
---
That's exactly what I've been doing. I still use sand savant and haven't cast a shade in 2 days. Still feels awful. 
---
I've also basically switched completely to reaper in the vast majority of content. I only swap to scourge in group content that needs a support. Metas and such I've given up, just play dps now.
---
The irony of all this is that I would actually have a reason to make a full legendary set if they made it work with templates...
---
I think you are talking about some stuff that is right to an extent but maybe play into popular oppinion or how things were construed at the time a bit too much. I talked on similar points earlier in this thread but I was musing quite alot and didn't express it very effectively.
---
You have to keep a couple of things in mind when it comes the industry and what transpired. That core systems designers leave is pretty common. They are a high commodity in the market, move rather freely, are often headhunted and the industry at large is not very loyal (in either direction of employer or employees). It's still seen as creative work (art) with alot of freelancing and the development cycles of the products also creates alot of project hiring and that kind of workforce management.
---
If you look at alot of the early PR when Anet was talking about the game and its gameplay, the people who often popped up was Colin, Isaiah, Eric and Jon. They are not listed as corporate founders and they may even be regarded differently in terms of upper- and middle management in terms of corporate structure. However, people with insight and responsibility often hold sway regardless of title. Them talking about the subjects was not coincidental.
---
When Colin left, Eric and Jon had already left for Amazon. It's more likely that Colin was headhunted and stayed to see through the release of HoT and hand over the rudder. Mike stepping in to hold the rudder was less likely over making Colin a scapegoat for the reception of HoT than it was to fill and difficult-to-fill vacancy that probably came with some surprise but not some surprise treason of any kind. MO likely filled the vacancy in lieu of appropriate candidates. The rest is most likely a media dog and pony show.
---
The same goes for the whole new IP debacle. Working on new IP's and that core systems designers that remain at a company are moved to work on new IP's post release is also completely normal in the industry. That is how most games are made. Core designers move on to work on new core design. Since Isaiah is posting here I'm sure he could confirm or deny, but it would have been perfectly logical for him to have been moved to new IP's as much as it is normal to see other designers move to other companies' new IP's.
---
What is interesting is not that it was being done. What is interesting for us GW2 players and general speculators on Reddit is how much resources were moved between the different IP's, what the balance was. Was GW2 given enough resources to sustain itself and the other projects. That's where it starts getting interesting for everyone, for management, employees and consumers. That is where we experience whether the game is productive or not. That is from where we have felt that the product, the game, has become surprisingly unproductive. What are the chief ghosts in the machinery there? Legacy code/docs? Management/structure? Workforce management? Management decisions/competence? Workforce decisions/competence? Expectations, feasibility and parent company frames or interference? Changes in vision or direction? Communication policies? There is quite a large gray area here that we know very little about but that is very interesting to speculate about.
---
Nothing innocent about knowing that the casual trash aka the majority is not usually the focus of development.
---
They don't stick around long enough to pay. At most they might buy the xpacs (singular now) and a skin or two. They certainly aren't the ones who will be paying for the new build templates either.
---
Most of them actually think that the 3 that we are getting "for free" are new (and not repurposed pve wvw and spvp* templates)
---
*They couldn't even get spvp template to work properly
---
&gt;This will just kill the topic and discussion tbh.
---
That's exactly what they want. Gotta keep pushing the narrative that ANet can do no wrong after all.
---
Listen youre not getting it. Ive drank deep from the font of eternity and witnessed the cosmic essence of what it is to truly be. You think everything this past year has been a series of coincidences and bad turns? Everything can be traced back to shattered aegis. The trait is nerfed in december and suddenly a little over a month later arenanet is hit with huge layoffs. We then move into the warclaw, easily the worst year gw2 has ever had in terms of balance, the paltry august 30 announcement, pushes for more monetization, and now big O leaving the company. The base will of the universe is against arenanet ever since they nerfed shattered aegis, and onky the reenstatement of its former power can catapult us past these tumultous times.
---
yeah lmao it was like a massive essay saying how disappointed he was with the community and it got 0 upvotes and died in new and all the comments were like "lol cya"
---
"Whats your happiest memory involving Guild Wars"
---
WildStar was a fucking mess, I'm surprised it even released.
---
I'm even more surprised NCSOFT didn't take control and fired all the incompetent managers in the first place.
---
Because they know people have a ton of characters and would end up buying slots for them as well.
---
"Don't have enough slots? Well maybe you should make a new character and buy the slots for them too! Oh, no char slot? We sell those too!!"
---
Should extremely obvious why they're limiting it when arcdps, for years, did not.
---
There is nice chair on tp right now , support them.
---
They were letting GW2 die, that's the problem. There won't be resources for future projects if you throw away your only source of income.
---
For long I thought this was some kind of misspelling of "Kiss" and I always wondered myself why people would say that, untill I actually googled it lol. Now I still associate it with "Kiss" and everytime I see it it cracks me up.
---
I believe that they should allow arcdps' templates feature to continue. Maybe they should give it six months or a year if they really can't handle the lost revenue, but I believe that would be a fine compromise for them, and if I was tossed in as the person to handle this situation today, that's what I would do.
---
No, but I have paid for other stuff to make the things I like more enjoyable.
---
Feels like I spent it in vain.
---
just go look in the mirror for that
---
Everything seemed to limited. If the armory was like THIS  [https://imgur.com/a/lH94tUR](https://imgur.com/a/lH94tUR) . Then yea maybe I would care to pay for it. But no...
---
Build templates are not removing those things from you.
---
&gt; I love this game to death
---
Problem is these people think we hate the game and that's why we complain. Bit hard to use reason here.
---
&gt; I think/hope/fear that I'm equally as annoying to the ones shilling for anet as they are for me 
---
I know i am taking into account some of the things I've been told. Must be nice using anonymity to mass report someone when you disagree with them. If only doing that got them punished.
---
Well if the guardian think they did fine - it's niceness, but if they think hey did not - they'll assume sarcasm.
---
Path of Exile is one of the best examples of "doesn't need a sequel" because of the league system.
---
Every few months they have a completely isolated environment in which they can completely turn all of the systems and economy upside-down. The major numbered patches have essentially been sequels, and the freedom for them to wholesale replace parts of the game and still maintain a large playerbase to test it is why.
---
True but they lost its value for me
---
there were 6 and 3 have been replaced more or less
---
My bad I was unclear: I agree with you, I mean that \_ you trash runes / sigils and have to buy insignias and stuff \_ is a lot of money. 
---
I'd rather use "free" ascended from fractals / marks
---
It happens because of mounts. You can fix it by relogging.
---
You shouldn't have been downvoted. This happens all the time. You get into an argument with a baddie from a fractal or something so they block you and just continue spamming you with hate while you can't message back.
---
Thats a "you" issue, not anet's.
---
I don't think many of them play the game anymore, and that's a big problem. They just don't understand the product, and the few who did are no longer around to push on the right direction.
---
The subreddit in general tends to lean towards negativity. It's one of the more toxic subreddits I've ever been on, which is shocking considering how opposite it is ingame.
---
Let's take a look at that by numbers.
---
Character slot: 800 gems
---
Lets use some... low numbers for the cost of these template slots.
---
* Equipment template: 300 gems X 2 = 600 gems
---
* Build template: 3 for 100 gems = 100 gems
---
That means you end up spending a net increase of only 100 gems. Sure, there are a few other benefits to other characters, like economic stimulation when you make new gear, the cost of transmutation stones, etc. And that's using lower template costs than I've actually seen people speculate.
---
Unless I'm missing a value in new characters somewhere. I don't raid and I don't do alts really, so I'm definitely open about being ignorant on that.
---
&gt; emoticons 
---
2005 called, msn messenger wants their emoticons back.
---
What about this exactly made you cringe? In real life when your coworkers say good job you cringe?
---
the best part about the JP fiasco is we not only got to see that psycho fired, as a bonus we got to see you leave as mod! double whammy!
---
It’s not a troll build. It’s overpowered.
---
I most certainly do not need legendary equipment to use build templates
---
Well it is, because people who are supporting them "lose" even more than people who didn't support them at all. And they don't care
---
Are we finally at the point you say "life isn't fair"?
---
They are sensationalist and politically biased, but that doesn't means they haven't done good journalism before.
---
Why don’t you offer advice as to how you think this is counterable? They just spam evades the entire time and bomb you with condis.
---
yes, no, no
---
I recall the same feeling the first time it came out.  Stayed up until 4am until I finally nailed it.  Now I find it fun, and try to get most of the  chests on the way up for extra challenge.  It's also funny how competitive it becomes racing other players to the top.    Part of the trick is to realize where you can stand is greater than what you see, and approach/jump to narrow pieces at an angle.
---
I mean using :) can sometimes be worse in a sarcastic situation. If you just died or something and someone goes nice job :) it's still not gonna help lol.
---
Also, their new subreddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ManaWorks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManaWorks/)
---
Wow, did you get this girl part from Facebook or 9gag?
---
The thing is I didn't demand anything big. 
---
And I would pay for templates, but what they're doing is ridiculous. And it's fucking up my game play totally. So yes, I don't have the right to wish for everything, but this doesn't mean you should and have to accept everything. 
---
Would you recommend all of us to just leave guild wars 2 and find another project?
---
3? Unless you count Aurene replacing Kralk.
---
What went wrong then? I doubt Glint and the Forgotten would replace one evil dragon with another. Unless they didn't choose the replacements (which ones do you think are the replacements btw?)
---
And aren't we repeating the same mistakes? Is Aurene bound to be driven crazy by the amount of magic she's consuming just like Kralkatorrik warned us? It's like we're building a ticking bomb... next one.
---
One more thing I don't understand about Elder Dragons - if they're just "drug" (magic) addicts then why do they care to create minions like Risen, Mordrem etc? It's not just for defense so they can eat more undistrubed... Mordremoth clearly attacked us first.
---
I mean, what do you expect? Companies have been riding the "diversity" train these last years, hiring pretty much anyone they could find just to fill in quotas, without a proper vetting process.
---
Then we find out half of them are crazy, and the other half just hates videogames and videogame consumers. This has to be one of the worst bubbles of the last decades.
---
How do you even have space left in your inventory with that many different builds? Legendary items aside, that's still a truckload of trinkets, and whatever parts you dont have legendary is going to take up a huge amount of slots as well
---
I would use more builds if I could easily switch them.
---
I really hope the new studio makes a spiritual successor to guild wars 1. The whole concept of gaining new skills to overcome new areas was really fun.
---
Found the Jessica Price fanboy/girl.
---
Its okay to type suggestion but dont act like anet is in any way obliged to even read it.
---
About possibility of you leaving, I dont care either way. Do what you want. Just to note, I find those "Im leaving and taking my money with me" threats laughable. In 7 years people posted it so many times it lost any power.
---
Go out and say hello to the sun once in a while, you milk-skinned hermit!
---
-Your mom probably
---
The lack of self-awareness with these folks is astounding.
---
If they simply allow arc to continue, I have no issues with anet's version. After all it's at worst neutral if nothing is lost. As long as they allow me to continue to use ARC templates then either neutral (don't use) or positive (use it, and pay as much as you feel comfortable with). I think alot of people are in the same position. 
---
I'm glad we were able to have a meaningful discussion. Please in future, either start with this or simply shout your opinion. Don't pretend people with criticism refuse to argue or move forwards; they simply want improvements.
---
Is there any source or statistic you have to back this up?
---
I say an i9 9900ks is your best bet alongside an RTX Titan with 64 GB of DDR4 @4200Hz or more should do the trick.
---
While Guild Wars itself won’t benefit from the hexacore multithreaded support the i9 9900ks  the rest of your system will. Your game shouldn’t slow down your Netflix stream on your side monitor running edge browser or chrome
---
Same goes for the people loudly complaining about every little thing, though.
---
She should be thankful she was hired in the first place, having a pretty shitty track record at her shoulders.
---
M O N K A W
---
When your commander in DS doesn't know how to do blighting tower and refuses to communicate, everyone has a right to be angry.
---
Those stats are YIKES. But not as YIKES as the gameplay.
---
*"Kotaku*’s understanding, via our source, is that while O’Brien will be working with other departing ArenaNet developers who had recently been working on technology for the potential future *Guild Wars* project, **the developers are not taking what they made with them**."
---
so what you're saying is that these build templates are going to crash my game even worse on every game update?
---
That's not what I wanted to say I'm not leaving gw2 at all. If I would I wouldnt care at all what's going on with those templates.
---
You kinda had some good points and I also understand the other group and how it is annoying. But I got my point of view.
---
That's it for now.
---
By the way it was nice chatting with you. Wasn't that stupid "lol you're an idiot" talking
---
Yea, as the 300 brave Spartan soldiers stood, had their own shields shattered, and died together at the cliffs of Thermopylae nearly two and a half millenia hence (almost to the day!), so must we brave citizens of Tyria stand united against the growing threats which assault us endlessly, from within and without, and rebuke those not brave enough to stand and sacrifice with us, their brothers in arms, bound forever by blood!
---
ANet should take a leaf from other games in a similar position to them. I think Warframe is the best reference point here: similarly-sized studio, similar relationship with their parent company, similar business models.
---
The difference is that Digital Extremes (Warframe's dev) has invested far more into new mechanics and engine upgrades than ANet. ANet has instead invested far more into art and general content. While there are positives to both, the end result is that GW2 is getting dated and performance is actually regressing, while Warframe feels like it came out this year. ANet has also quite unfortunately deprecated a lot of its own content (all of the base game open world barring a few key things, dungeons, etc.), whether knowingly or not, which drastically hampers the value of their investment.
---
whatever . deal with it. they decided a number which will be probably ok for everyone but the 1% of the richest who got enough equip to spend gold to gem conversion. you won't go failed. you know
---
Good talk, have a nice weekend
---
It’s not that AMD CPUs aren’t competitive or that they’re not capable of out performing intel CPUs  with today’s modern games. It’s that older games programs were coded to better take advantage of intel chips. This comes straight from AMD.  Guild Wars 2 is one of those games.
---
&gt; Paying isn't the outrage, it's that the system is WORSE than what Arc offers for FREE. If it was the same system or better, much fewer people would have an issue.
---
Not neccesarily worse, just different. ArcDPS sure as hell isn't giving you free inventory space in place of the additional equipment you got to carry.
---
Was really hoping for a way to make carapace work with Reaper, but the stack requirement is too high to maintain on a power build.  
---
How's it for solo roaming?
---
No, ArenaNet did not make these available as additional purchases just because players said they'd be willing to pay for it.  Get fuckin' real and pay attention.  This game is largely funded with microtransactions - that's been the model since day 1 and ArenaNet has always been transparent in this.  Anyone who expects big, new features for free outside of Living World content releases is simply naive as fuuuuuuuuuuck.
---
**There is no reason to expect features like this for free**, and every reason to expect them to appear in the gemstore or otherwise monetized.  This is the model - people need to learn it, accept it, and stop bitching about it.  Let's not forget that everyone's getting some template slots for free.  Learn how business works and show some gratitude numbskulls.
---
Kiss yourself &lt;3
---
Thanks, now I'll never see it the same again.
---
so basically what your saying is that the CURRENT system of loadout that we have (oct 2019) is that when you change stuff thats what stays, and when we move over the the NEW templates system it's just going to be the loadout system we already have but with gear storage (ala the swapping gear changes the template issue) and the same amount of "templates" that we already have.
---
tldr: So we're getting sharing and some item storage with the ability to purchase more.
---
&gt;the rest of your post is quite fun.
---
See you're getting the gist of how this reddit4entertainment thing works. Proud of u!
---
Half of the posts are whiteknights posting "WHY DOES THE COMMUNITY NOT LIKE THIS" memes and then getting bashed into the ground to be honest.
---
They kinda had it coming.
---
Something about the word wonderful isn't it... I see it used sarcastically/ironically far more than genuinely, it feels like.
---
LETS INSTEAD CIRCLEJERK OVER BEING THE FRIENDLIEST COMMUNITY WITH ANOTHER FLUFFY LEGENDARY SOME CASUAL MADE AFTER 7 YEARS :))))
---
monkeys.
---
Well I've always wanted to visit Denmark.
---
strong condi burst. *condis not even ticking over 1k*
---
Oh thank god someone else mentioned this. I get that raiders et al are upset, but this sub goes full salt over everything. 
---
I have no stake in the result one way or the other, but I do hope ANet and the ArcDPS devotees can resolve this somehow.
---
...In that context, it is.
---
Just because something isn't outright a pejorative, doesn't mean it can't be construed as an insult. The hostile intention is clearly there.
---
&gt; People are just ruminating the same old arguments for an entire fucking week and nobody changes his mind on anything.
---
The last time I read a *new* argument/complaint was on the day of the stream.
---
I don't think they will allow it at all. What does that say about their motives and outlooks? 
---
I agree its not necessarily malicious. It's possible they mismanaged the game so badly in the past that they are desperate for cash. But that still doesn't look good for the future then; does it.
---
Radical denial.
---
I always thought that this community was super nice...is this just a pvp thing?
---
Well she dodged a bullet.
---
GW2 makes is very easy to be nice in-game. It's when you get down to any 'elite' or competitive subset that it gets ugly, in GW2 or anywhere.
---
She radiates, ala Chernobyl radiation.
---
Yeah, but what if they did pretty good but felt like they wiffed a bunch of important skill timings.
---
Will these lames ever be happy? I think the answer is no. They are just going to make Anet start ignoring the whole reddit community we'll get lumped in with them. I wish they would go figure out and solve what makes them all so angry all the time. Rather than dumping on unrated things for the distressing all the god damn time.
---
Gaile was always more fluff than brains to be honest.
---
And pretty important, it's done right, without shameless pandering.
---
Gaile is the reason all WvW discussion was banned on the forums. To this day you can get threads and posts removed by just mentioning some servers in them.
---
A new drake mount, so you can raid the patriarchy into the sunset.
---
Greatsword with F1 (even bettwter range with Berserker :p) and the general range/mobility of the weapon.
---
Axe 5 is nice because you can spin and move at the same time to cover more ground/tag more mobs (also you move faster during this skill).
---
Then you can take a few mobility skills like Bull's Charge and Stomp.
---
If tagging is really all you're interested with in a specific event (and not what kind of damage you may do) then I would suggest Lobgbow because of the range (you can spam the AA and swap target) and it has 1 attack that pierces, 1 AoE attack and the F1 can cover a big area with any spec.
---
It wasn't like this before. It recently happened because the complaints have reached a boiling point. Because there is a hell of a lot to complain about.
---
Reddit hug of death. RIP
---
Agreed. "Please stop criticizing the game because I'm new and don't care about the nuances for the game yet" isn't a legitimate reason to squelch criticism on a discussion board.
---
I used to think “ffs” was just someone trying to make the psh noise but in text and found it very odd.  Took me awhile to realize it was an acronym...
---
I'm not rich, I got free ascended from fractals, I don't have gold to buy 6 templates for all my 8 alts.
---
Thanks you, have fun
---
Man nothing convinces me of a point than being told I said things I never did.
---
They could use GW2 assets to build GW3, or even make GW3 some sort of standalone expansion. Just cross a portal and you're in the new setting.
---
Still, I think people overvalue the things we achieved here in GW2. When you start a new game, you want a fresh start. Some bonus stuff here and there is fine, but carrying over something like the whole wardrobe? That could potentially ruin the game experience in the first place.
---
It has different names for each weight, but it looks the same on each.  You should find it under the name “visage of the khan-ur” on the wiki.
---
Tbf it's the code of an old engine. Would a new game come out, I hope it'd be on a new engine, so the knowledge in the coding of that specific engine of GW2 wouldn't be of much use.
---
Better than subscription and even better than P2W. But to each their own i guess
---
A little confused here, what is "pay up" beyond giving a refund and letting them keep the skin anyway?
---
...Wow.
---
Huh, thanks.
---
Speeeectacular!
---
Thank you for your response. I realized I asked the question horribly. 
---
Do your responses mean, no I can't?
---
yep, scourge has to be baby sat in comp modes even more than before.  Aoe's do less than other aoes and condi's tick less than other classes condi's but there still has to be a shade nerf to satisfy the WvW people.
---
Necro scales too much with groups, needs to be rebalanced so there can maybe be some survival abbilites
---
Its an acronym for 'keep yourself safe'. That goes for you too, as the game can get toxic sometimes love
---
got 'em
---
arcDPS has some issues. 1-) If something goes wrong and an item gets deleted you are just fucked because Anet is not responsible for you using 3rd party tools.2-) The interface sucks. 3-) It's made by 1 guy so if he decides to not give a fuck anymore then you can't use arc anymore. 4-) You can't link builds in chat.
---
So what people meant when they said "i would pay gems for a build template",  is atleast in my case, i want something like arc with a more functional interface, that's supported by arenanet and that has the useful build sharing system from gw1. 
---
That would be an upgrade over arc and it would have value that is worth paying gems for.  They wouldn't even have to end arcDPS because it would be strictly superior to it, almost like a premium version. What Anet delivered however is simply a major downgrade that costs money with the very high chance of arcDPS not supporting templates anymore.
---
somehow burn guard, condi mirage( holy shit bleeding stacks), burn elle and condi thief have harder and more condi burst than necro but no nerf on range effectiveness or defensive mechanics.
---
Same with getting to the hidden garden too.
---
I'm so sorry, but all I could think of when I read that studio name was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ytei6bu7kQ).
---
Maybe he was annoyed because he felt like he did all the work.
---
It's still a pretty unprofessional thing to do, since you're potentially jeopardizing the whole company "just because you're bored".
---
This kind of attitude would explain why GW2 has been a constant experiment of new things one after another, with nothing solid to look forward too.
---
People have been here before... you're just late or didnt see the previous post. Just check youtube you'll find everything there.
---
Expected result.. I block anyone that whispers me during/after pop match
---
Why can nobody get it? it's on the TP for 7k
---
You should've put "/r/guildwars2" on all three of them
---
It is a demanding question though
---
For a casual, it's the perfect game. 
---
For hardcore veterans caught up with the game, it's the worst game.
---
It takes about 2 years for a casual to turn hardcore like at least 5 hours/day so around 3k game hours
---
That might be a solution. Unfortunately they can't offer them for cheap (the price they are worth) because gold to gems would mean they make no money, which is an issue for a lot of the gemstore as it's all over priced.
---
Do people actually complain about people with a ton of templates that prefer ArcDPS, or is that just a meme?
---
This is the biggest issue for me. If moving my legendaries to a different character breaks all my build templates, then it seems pointless for me to use my build templates
---
Its our aegis, brother
---
What others have said. A high clock(frequency) Intel chip is likely your best bet. GW2 is not really multi-threaded and any midrange GPU will run the game at full. Probably the only variable to that is if you are running multi-display, or 4k or something.
---
One of the reasons I'm surprised that a team oriented game mode forces players to queue either solo or with only 1 other player.
---
oh yes, the attitude of ["WHY on God's green earth do you need so many goddamn builds?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dc0byt/another_content_creator_about_to_be_gone/f25gsnn/) is very prevalent right now
---
you see lots of strawmen as well like "nobody needs 9000 build templates, this is a made-up problem!"
---
Technically correct. The best kind of correct.
---
Let me discredit anyone against my ideas with some random bs. I think you are a Russian bot how is that XD. LMFAO for sure.
---
This comment sums up the internet in the nutshell and my outlook overall. Just imagine how many posts and comments one could take seriously if it was easy to make the distinction.
---
At this point one should ask how does this affect the game economy, Do we want people making less legendary gear?
---
Staff D/D all the way - just a pure DPS machine that never stops.  The build you linked it is better suited for Fractals or against champs, but to fight OW trash / map completion, I'd drop Fists for Assassin's Signet and I prefer Haste over Shadowstep.
---
Impact Strike is great overall, but if you're in Core Tyria, pre-Orr, you're unlikely to run into many mobs with defiance bars, so you can slot in Dagger Storm for the lulz.
---
I'm also more partial to running Trickery 3-1-2, or if you need more condi cleanse, 3-2-2 assuming you're running Haste.  Even though they nerfed the range on Swipe, it's still great to keep your momentum up as you zip around the map.
---
I remember when I first started to play GW2. My first MMO and I instantly fell in love. I miss those days of innocent exploring maps and solving hearts.
---
Also, warrior was and still is my main :D
---
After someone brought it up this week, I took a look into Glassdoor's reviews of Anet, and it's clear the management is the problem. There are super talented people terribly managed, a lot of mention of managers stepping in at the last second wanting to change something set in stone months before. In that context, I feel NCSoft's interference was not enough - the problem are the middlemen and not the talent.
---
I know there were two projects they were working on alongside GW2.  My guess is the bigger project was a new game from Anet.  Not only did a dev drop the ball during a livestream but also the potential leak from the watch giveaway.
---
My guess is that once MO gave Z the reigns, MO went to work on a new game with some of the older and more skilled employees.  They started working on it while GW2 was basically on rails creating the same mundane content called Living Story.  NCSoft saw something they didn't like (most likely growth and player retention) and told Anet to fix up while also forcing layoffs to cut their losses short.  Now that Anet was basically forced to make GW2 content, MO and the others now at ManaWorks are making a new game.  If the art style says anything from their profiles on their website, it looks like its going to be some kind of cartoon-like adventure game.
---
The other project definitely could have been a mobile version of GW2 or maybe a whole different game.  There's no telling without someone from the inside confirming.  I wouldn't even be surprised if it was an Anet app that let you do things between their games along with minigames that would let you earn things between the two games.
---
GW is my first MMO too! I'm loving it so far
---
Guys... I'M FLYING?
---
Pvp in any community is super toxic lol.
---
Don't worry that's not the first to try and it will result of a official and an unofficial one
---
You mean falling with style?
---
If you ever need help about an item or something, type:  
---
/wiki (and then press shift + click on the item).
---
Have a great time! And also, as someone already said, don't be afraid to ask for help. GW community is the best.
---
For the most part, always, actually.  Kotaku is trash, but they do their research when it comes to these sorts of things and are usually one of the first to break news on articles.  Actual articles, mind you, and not their drivel opinion articles and clickbait speculation.  In this case the claim that Mike would have been likely spearheading the work to develop Guild Wars 3 isn't that crazy of a claim (the article even said said GW3 wasn't greenlit, just some preliminary stuff that *could* have been worked into the game down the line).  Beyond that the stuff like many well known names leaving is confirmed.
---
Of course this doesn't necessarily mean Season 5 is the end.  Arenanet/NCsoft will simply replace the people who leave the company, and so long the game remains profitable it's going to have a future.  Either in updates, possible expansions, or even a GW3 all of it is on the table so long GW2 still generates income.  *Quality* might change, but money is all that matters for if the game has a future.
---
Be prepared to be referred to as a Salad. 
---
Welcome to gw2
---
You can look around the starting area for a weapon vendor (will have a Sword icon on the map) from which you can purchase weapons at LV 5, and every 5 level increment afterwards.  
---
Of course you will also get rewards from completing story missions.
---
Oh sure it’ll happen one day. But it’ll be 1,200 gems per character.
---
You should test every weapon!
---
Its adivised to update your gear every 10 levels or  so. Try testing then all while doing it.
---
asking on the gw2 sub won't get you an accurate portrait of what's going on, you are asking some of the steadily shrinking but still going group that still believes gw2 has a future.
---
I will concede that the beta was amazing when I played it
---
Ooooh, pretty hair.
---
Welcome!
---
One of us.
---
I'm preparing
---
Thanks
---
Minionmancer is a fucking Juggernaut, though.
---
* Power Tank hi-toughness boon support - (mistrel gear, maximum support build like Illusions and All's Well That Ends Well)
---
* Power off-tank boon support - (berserker/diviner's gear, maximum DPS trait set up like Dueling)
---
* Condi hi-toughness tank - (trailblazer's setup)
---
* Condi lo-toughness tank - (viper's setup)
---
* Mirage condi DPS
---
* Chrono Power DPS
---
Just listed 6 builds for you that are all completely different and used often, all for one profession in one gamemode (raids), and still isn't anywhere near enough, let alone mentioning things like Fractals and WvW and hell, even just an open-world solo build for doing story in.
---
Also I can vouch for seeing the attitude he's describing in pretty much all threads about build templates atm. This reads like you already know what you want to think and you need to smack down any dissension.
---
Two years of mismanagement. I guess not much will change.
---
This is what I care about the most. Why is GW2 so poorly optimized? My rig can run other games on max 4k 60FPS and yet struggles with GW2.
---
I checked and it seems the issue is CPU bottlenecking but holy crap based on my estimates, I would need an insane CPU to run GW2 at 4K and expect solid 60 FPS
---
Been trying to make a meme poison build but nothing has worked so far compared to power scourge.  Shaman stats is a definite yikes though.
---
I will say, your way of going over the build and just showing everything is a hell of a lot better than people talking about it for 10 minutes.
---
you seem to be reading rather selectively then tbh.
---
and the main criticism regarding monetization is not about monetization in general, but rather the fast that anet intents to monetize all 3 elements of this system, with 2 elements just being glorified clipboards.
---
that then leaves us with gear templates, for which we - as it seems for now - are supposed to shell out a similar amount as we have shelled out for inventory slots... which we bought over the past 7 years to hold that exact same gear, effectively charging people, especially veterans, a second time.
---
sure, sell gear template slots for 50-100 gems a pop. sure, be backwards and make them irreversible soul bound unlocks. but don't charge us for glorified clipboard slots, and don't make it seem like the freed up inventory from gear templates is insane value.
---
and all of this is on top of the issues and limitations of this system, and the much more attractive monetization solutions people could come up with (e.g. account armory, skin templates).
---
This! 
---
It maybe not be as optimal crazy dps/break bar/optimal rotation blah blah blah 
---
But by the six is it fun. You run around summoning 3 other thiefs by your side while you shoot everyrhing in your path AND have great sustain. It may not be optimal but its FUN and i highly suggest using this build.
---
MO, company director and lead programmer presumable at blizzard...featured 1999 as one of the most influencal people in the industry in a well known magazine and you say small fry? how does small fry get 15 million from a studio which doesn't even have a title yet. at the time it got bought, 2 years after founding, the original guild wars was not even out yet. that was 2005.  
---
come on. 3 people got a lot of money and one of them worked later even as ceo at ncsoft. do you think some random dev from a just founded studio which doesn't even have a game out yet can pull that off just like this? :D
---
&gt; delete anything they don't like.
---
That's why.
---
Everyone here (you+replies) seems to be missing that it's not a game subreddit. It's a company subreddit. A company that did not release anything yet, and will probably not do for quite a while (maybe years).
---
"I much rather pay for content than for convenience"  
---
"Arenanet announces next Living World *Saga* will have paid episodes in order to close the gap between free episodic content and paid expansion content"
---
Maybe the people who said they will pay for it are not complaining :thinking:
---
It could be a really good thing. The mobile market is filled with garbage shovel ware. Quality games are rare.
---
Thing is I'm not even THAT hardcore in gw2, especially compared to my wow raiding days. I want templates so that I can more easily experiment with wacky builds that today are a pain in the ass to manage between gear and skill respects. Especially remembering setups days after. But right now the proposed limitations and artificial scarcity imposed at the start merely to be monetized away actively hampers that experimental drive.
---
no, we're talking measurements - reaper having low dps compared to other classes being the reason for prejudice in pugs. i agree that weaver is harder to play than reaper, and all you said about pug weaver vs pug reaper but the fact is reaper is low so ppl hate it, and pugs care way more about this sort of stuff. i play reaper almost exclusively and around the high-end tryhard community (fractals tho, fuck raids) and those ppl care way less whether you're reaper or not. pugs are just poison
---
Maybe I've just been really lucky with my matchmaking ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Like I'm not saying everyone else is wrong I'm just saying I have personally had as good an experience with the pvp community as I have with the pve community. And tbh that's not even to say I haven't met any toxic players at all, just a majority of nice ones.
---
Yeah generally the prices are much higher when a wing releases for obvious reasons. I stopped playing the game relatively soon after W7 release cause of the disappointment.
---
Or a Traitor.
---
Traitor Salad.
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
I mained DD since hot till pof my 2c! Run daredevil!
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PawAoqZlNwwYbsLGJW2XrtUA-zxQYhojDcH0XZERFkRKY7sk+qF-e
---
Thats my open world pistola/pistol daredevil.
---
You can totally use berserker trinkets instead of assassins (i'm spoiled with arc templates) and whatever runes/sigils you like, it will work just fine.
---
You just spam pistol 3 and dodge away if something comes close. If mobs are clustered or they have reflect, just spam staff 5 and daggerstorm (drop your endurance and activate assassin signet if doing this).
---
Spam pistol 4 for cc.
---
You can swap assassin signet for signet of shadows (movement speed one) and run bounding dodge (the DPS dodge). Bounding dodge allows you to stealth into your pistol 5, or into a smokescreen if you really need. 
---
Unhindered combatant works better for mindlessly killing mobs though.
---
You can also run a physical skill variant: pick 1 on the middle trinkery line (instead of 2). Replace your heal for channeled vigor, your stunbreak for bandit's defense and your elite for impact strike. Run 3 on the 1st daredevil trait to lower all those cds!!!
---
This build can pretty much solo any soloeable open world stuff, including most champion and some legendary mobs!
---
Glhf!
---
While that's mostly true, the main issue I quoted above is that there are fun bosses and there are bosses that nobody wants to optimize. Dhuum, Cairn, Matthias, and a few others are universally hated bosses that are just not fun to speed run. With most Meta compositions anyways, they're always super high-risk, high-reward, so HC guilds tend to /gg over and over again until you get the perfect run, obviously. One hour is just not enough to accomplish what guilds would aim for, and would be another time sink that interferes in another optimization (for a chance at an absolutely miniscule prize pool, I should add).
---
Are you still confused that rydralain was responding to me?
---
Play more, the story explains a lot of this.
---
So better not invest more time in this because it will end in 2 years and all. The legendaries I have are lost?
---
new checkbox makes templates obsolete.
---
if only it wasn't limited by equipment type.
---
But you called yourself MrBacon. Bacon Salad hmmm.
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
If you are just killing mobs pistol pistol will be as fast or FASTER! A single unload will kill a non vet mob, and with UC you can kill-dash-repeat to your hearts content!
---
Exactly this. 
---
Account wide- with one click. 
---
Really need to think this out. 
---
Like seriously think about what your proposing.
---
You'll be wanting a rifle later on, for kiting story bosses which hit inexplicably hard, or reaching the guy over terrain.
---
It's your best chance for soloing anything that seems too difficult.
---
All you need to know 
---
Content = Gem Store 💎
---
I think I’ve had to mentor tag up in that scenario... it was horrifying...
---
&gt;But apparently this subreddit wants every feature for free
---
No, we want shit to EARN rather than throw every single outfit, glider and mount skin into the gem store or the loot boxes. We want templates to be free because other games do it free, arcdps was free as well and it was SUPERIOR to this garbage that ANet wants us to pay for.
---
I am so sick and tired of you white knights trying to push the narrative that people just want every feature for free, NONE of you even bother reading what we're saying, you just make up whatever bullshit you want to keep pushing your PoV.
---
That was me. Got it after seeing how colorful and energetic the game was and I was so happy with it. Played Warrior and Ranger at launch and I've never abandoned those classes.
---
ah so you're concern trolling, got it
---
I hope that, in case they create a new fantasy MMORPG, we can trade skins from both games and vice versa. I always wanted skins from AION (also published by NCSoft) but unfortunately both studies didn't find a way to trade Guild Wars 2 and Aion skins.
---
Hey someone finally recommended warrior rifle unironically
---
Perhaps small fry was the wrong terminology to use. However my original point still stands. As a newly formed studio with no product yet, I think they needed a publisher. Influencial, absolutely. Enough money to self publish for a brand new studio? Highly doubt it! And that's most any game. Eventually some devs get big enough to self publish, but look at most any game out there and the devs usually fall under some publisher.
---
I agree with you woth the sense that it is a hassle regardless, and that it will make it a bit more annoying.
---
But I can‘t really agree on the 'So not much different from now' part, since the majority of people having so much builds and/or sharing gear currently do use ArcDPS Build templates.
---
You unequip, share &amp; on a different toon load template - and you're good to go.
---
They haven't had weapon vendors in the starting areas outside the tutorials for years. You either go into the city or the crafting village in the map
---
Whatever helps you ignore criticism I guess.
---
You've competely missed the point.  Not wasting my time trying to explain it to a fanboy.
---
He's just worried that you'll out-dps him while being 3x harder to kill once you unlock your elites. (Which you will be) Both the reaper and scourge output scary dps and are survivable to boot.
---
I'll bear that in mind when I see actual criticism
---
The original Guild wars was my first mmo, and that got me into 5 years of World of Warcraft. Tried loads of MMOs after that to crave my itch that didn't get get scratched until Guild Wars 2 in 2011.
---
Exactly, like arc templates work now.
---
You learned debate on 4chan, didn't you?
---
😭🤣
---
BUY OR GO.
---
I've been put of the loop for awhile and not played since templates were introduced. Just been hearing about them and it sounds counterintuitive how they've been implemented.
---
No, no, he's not on the griffon.
---
&gt; moderate reddit like the official forums
---
Won't matter after gear templates I guess, since you have to change them from the hero panel anyways? (Dunno if I got that right though.)
---
It's okay! You can still enjoy what you can of the game and if that's not good there's so many games you can get into :)
---
So you're saying that after Build Templates are released, no one will EVER manually change gear via inventory again, ever?
---
People get especially annoyed if you are friendly while they are in rage mode. It's fun.
---
But what the hell happened to the chat color?
---
This reminds me so much of my first character. Also a salad! 
---
Are you playing on EU?
---
&gt;Someone will inevitably generate software/site to make this storage/editing/management of external build library more natural. 
---
Yes that will probably be the solution if it arrives as advertised and that's bad.  
---
We have arcdps-buildtemplates which is an external tool that works just fine
---
Problem is /u/deltaconnected wont be allowed to provide it to the public anymore.  
---
This means we replaced an amazing tool by another one which just forces someone in the community to put effort into developing something that we allready have.
---
Oh and btw all functions the new templates provide are allready implemented in the arcdps version. So for all of us using that it's a major downgrade cause we go from infinite slots to 3-6.
---
&gt; As long as unlocks are all account bound, I'll likely max out fairly quickly. If character bound, likely not at all. 
---
This is probably the only thing that can make this less tragic. If we get even gear templates account wide fine with me. If we don't for PvE engame players the game will get almost unplayable without spending a shitton of money and that shouldn't be accepted.
---
As you said yourself if they are char bound you probably wont get them. Question is what would you do if you would actually need them.  
---
Cause wasting 10min after a 5min Boss fight to swap an entire legi gear set + weapons + trinkets just isn't an option.
---
For a long time I thought it meant know your shit, and sometimes in pvp in gw2 or lol people would say kys and I used to say "I kys, I don't need anyone to tell me that" lmao.
---
Now I wonder what they actually thought after that.
---
Yep EU - Desolation
---
Magical phone.
---
Okay. Note that servers only matters for WvW, otherwise you can play with whoever is on EU. If you could send me your account name (ex, name.1234), I'd like to send over a welcome to Tyria goodie bag.
---
In my experience in wvw, more of the roamers are nice in whispers than not.  
---
There are a few bad eggs, but generally if I whisper someone "good fight" or they whisper first, it stays pretty wholesome.
---
If someone ever calls you any type of vegetable..ignore them, youll get used to it eventually.
---
Honestly, I would like to be called a potato
---
Alright
---
funny, there are so many bots that say the same basic stuff that you did. if you can think enough to play the game, you can think while you're posting here. Anet have a long and consistent pattern of deleting entire forum threads of player requests to fix the game while pushing out more gem store stuff that no one asked for. what do you get for telling people to be quiet while they try to make your game better?
---
What you see is the result of differences in color calibration between OP's screen, the mobile phone camera, and the screen you are using.
---
"You either die a noob or live long enough to be accused of hax."
---
Lovely idea, wish you the best!
---
what the fuck
---
&gt;**Mike Z:** Dedicated players also now have more flexibility in customizing their builds with the introduction of legendary runes and sigils, allowing you to create the perfect gear stats for any situation, and this leads to perhaps our biggest quality of life improvement for these dedicated fans. Character build and gear templates are coming to Guild Wars 2 in the near future. 
---
WHOOPS
---
I guess by "dedicated fans" they literally meant "dedicated fans," so people who are 100% happy with anything done in GW2. As opposed to heavily invested players — that's a different thing.
---
Gaile once closed a thread I had because I didn't agree with everyone responding to it.
---
She was the reason I left the forums and fled to Reddit.
---
There's something wrong with this. This visage of Khan'Ur is supposed to be a rare drop, not a super rare one, so there should be more of them on TP. I'll just patiently wait until time places everything in it's place.
---
And when I ask for multiclass/multirole all I get are people who have 2-3 classes with one build each, sometimes with one equipment to be moved between.
---
Im I... Im I the only one whose sylvary is a skinny b*tch?
---
I keep seeing 50-100 gems quoted as a fair price. But that is only $0.75-$1.25 which seems low.  I feel like $5 per slot is fair which is about 400 gems. I am wondering if this is because I am thinking about from a dollar to gem view. When you are coming at it  do you come from a gold to gems view or a dollars to gems view.
---
&gt; If you buy something from the gem shop, what exactly are you showing your support for? ... How is a company supposed to interpret all that?
---
That's not about indicating something to the company, that's about justifying the expense to myself. Like, if I want to buy something, I weight how much did I play this month, how much am I planning to play, did I pay for something in game already, will this item really impact how I play, is there a promotion etc. I don't buy a lot of items, so usually it goes "hey brain I want to buy it. I've played for the last half a year without spending a penny so it's ok to spend $10 on a game now". So it's more like spending on a game in place of subscription, than paying for a specific item. Sincerely, from a guy that patreons his favorite content creators and donates to wikipedia because they deserve it.
---
I kinda hope they felt bad after that.
---
Same necromancers my main tho
---
I’m legit curious to see laid out someone with a lot of builds and their differences between builds.
---
Only because I want to see if they significantly vary or have a common base with 2-4 tweaks.
---
None of my guildies/discordians who have complained have been willing to share the info with me :(
---
One thing that OP hasn't taking into account is that, while ascended gets the benefit of being cheaper for swapping between 3-6 gear sets, the legendary gear is far more convenient for making changes to a particular gear templates stats. If you want to drop your precision a bit because you have a ranger in your subgroup, it's much easier to do that with full legendary gear while sticking to the same template than it is to fiddle with pieces of ascended gear to get the right stats. 
---
And afterwards, you can just click the new checkbox they implemented to reset all of your legendary gear in a template to a single stat set. So legendary gear still has advantages over ascended.
---
Glad to hear it, welcome back!
---
So what gear sets do you carry around? Full minstrel, full berserker/diviner, full trailblazer, full vipers, and then two other DPS sets? 6 full armor sets, plus trinkets? Is that right?
---
Cite it
---
Oh! I didn't get this because I don't have sound on, ty.
---
Yet you wasted your time replying lmfao for sure flower boi.
---
Now kyth
---
I have a greatsword already, yeah
---
I don't think anyone should answer this for you since it spoils the story missions ahead. You will get answers to all this later.
---
So what you're saying is I'm right.
---
So maybe google it.
---
Ya know I might have to pop in for a run ;) Don't tell the hubby though, he's feeling guilty about taking a golfing trip to NM this weekend and that means I get my way for a few days next week. He would feel less so if he knew I was gaming all weekend. 
---
Funny, couple months ago when I tagged along on this I couldn't figure out what you were chatting about sometimes. Didn't think much of it until it was over then realized Twitch. (yes I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but they also say nothing cuts like a dull knife ;p)
---
I still have a $**+ ton of group food and utility buffs to get rid of so save your gold.
---
Maybe people who craft a legendary greatsword rather have a legendary sword.
---
"Praise-worthy" is really subjective, though. Like, Minecraft runs on phones. That game is praiseworthy as hell, and it works on a phone or tablet just fine. 
---
The claim was that "mobile phone is just a poor medium for a game". If you can put good games on a phone, and they work, then that's a false statement. Comparing them to a PC is ridiculous; I am not lugging my PC on the train with me. It's like saying that any game made for a GameBoy is inferior because consoles are more powerful.
---
No. One set, legendary armor. And arcdps to switch stats in 1 sec.
---
Personally I use full legendary, and carry around a bunch of extra trinkets and offhands for use where necessary. But before I made that I did have to carry around a stupid number of ascended pieces.
---
Nice info. Yup. The best workaround they had available looks to be 'fine, okay, everybody just glows, now you don't look weird, just don't leave the well lit areas'
---
Do you often make up scenarios like this in order to feel smug in comment sections?
---
Well I know quickswapping gear is going to be huge in PvE. Going from a full support to a full DPS build and back again in a second of downtime is going to change how we all interact with stuff like meta events. And stuff like maximizing crit chance is only something you can do in the context of raids or fractals, because you'll be able to precisely control your group buffs (banners, spotter, etc) so you know what you need. Can't do that in open world situations, so go ahead and swap and don't worry about min-maxing afterwards. If you need to min-max, you're probably in a raid or something, and unless you're in a full clear speedrun you definitely are going to have the minute or so of downtime you'll need to change a piece or two here or there.
---
Again, I definitely understand, it's not the same as being able to load up "Power DPS / Banner / No Spotter / Fractal Potion" and just know that all of your stats are 100% perfect. I get it. I'm just saying, in the grand scheme of problems, that's a solvable one, and the majority of people are going to see a huge QoL boost from this system. 
---
My bad about inspecting gear. They should really add that if they can; they let us ping gear so there should be a way of letting us ping templates.
---
&lt;3
---
They said that it'd be on a hotkey, and they said you could switch any time you're not in combat. They didn't mention raid or fractal instances, but IIRC you're in combat during boss fights at all times no matter what, so it shouldn't be a problem for them to allow it.
---
/u/Raknel I'm going to go ahead and consolidate responses because it seems you two are very gungho about your opinions- which is great. However, where have I said I've dismissed classic? Where have I said that GW1 wasn't a successful game? Where have I said that old games are obsolete?
---
All I said, and specifically so, was that WoW Classic is hard to judge the success of as it's within the "honeymoon phase", so to speak. I also included the reasons why and how people were tired of WoW Classic (back when it was actually WoW).
---
In reference to DerEndgegner specifically: You've listed a huge amount of assumptions which aren't referenced at all in my post- unless you're misattributing `there is an inevitable peak that will be reached... as players reach max level of their characters` to `1000s on every server are 60 and still not leaving`. Because (out of context) contextually, that is a correct assumption. However, you're leaving out the `they will reach the same conclusion... "endgame" of classic WoW consists of [3 modes of play which aren't hugely rewarding]`.
---
But yeah, keep rocking on.
---
Take Guardian as an example. DH is full zerk, on the other hand PI DH is mix of zerk/assassins and thief runes or scholar depending on how well you can flank, same for power firebrand. Now condi firebrand is a mix of Grieving/sinister/Viper with Balthazar runes earth/bursting sigils, on the other hand Condi quickbrand is full viper with firebrand runes smoldering/bursting sigils. Thats 5 builds and I'm not couting heal firebrand nor Virtues DH for Earth Djinn with boon thief. And some infusions also change from build to build. I'm also not counting fractal builds. If you want I can take a screenshot of the amount of guardians builds that I have saved on arcdps with gw2skills links to show you the difference more clearly.
---
Part of the reason I imagine people assume that others are complaining about not being able to fit a bunch of slightly different builds is because usually people just post the names of the builds, many of which do look like basically the same thing. To someone who hasn't gotten that much into buildcrafting, power tank hi-toughness boon support and power off-tank boon support look almost identical, so even a few who've dipped their toes in the water might think you're just complaining about switching a piece of gear or two or switching a trait, not completely switching out your gear set and a fair amount of traits. So thanks for posting some of the specifics of the builds.
---
I think players like yourself are the only reason Anet would never implement this (even if it makes them money in a fair way), because of the backlash. The one solution to those players I can think of is that the purple gear (original legendary) should have some skin advantage over the red gear (soulbound replica). Maybe purple gear should be able to be transmuted without transmutation charges. Or maybe purple gear can be the only gear that can have the legendary skin. Players would hate the second option, but Anet would probably hate the first option.
---
Edit: To clarify on the second option: It could be that replicas have the skin but not any of the special visual effects, or it could be that replicas just have the precursor skin and cannot be transmuted to the legendary skin (along with any other non-purple gear not being able to be transmuted to the legendary skin). I'm not sure if we can make legendary trinkets multiple times, so i'm not sure how necessary it is right now to make a perk for purple vs. red trinkets besides their binding (like removing their special visual effects on red trinkets).
---
The difference is that China actually cares about the potential good that Hong Kong could do for China's economy.
---
Honestly, it comes down to ranks in most games.

You get Wood tier players thinking they're hotshit and blaming everyone else for being in Wood. Then you get Plats pushing Diamond and mad as fuck when they're stuck at their skill level. In top leagues, everyone either knows each other or knows why they're there unless it was a fluke.
---
you need to praise RNGsus
---
Its a dps meter addon that also had an extension that allows for build saving and loading (ie, build templates)

"I'm a bitch, you know"
---
Good call. I’ll try the same as well.
---
That explains everything, thank you.
---
Where on the internet do you think that's going to happen?
---
and she wonders why people hate her.  seriously she gives women a bad name -.-
---
and btw, i was part of gamergate and am a girl.  we exist Jessica.  stop claiming we "slaves".
---
That's the second listing in about 3 weeks. It has an insanely low drop chance ( even after doubling it ) and most people won't be able to get it, especially since each weight unlocks individually, meaning you need to get it 3 times if you want them all.
---
And then a random soldier wakes up in the barracks, picks up a weapon and heads towards a badass looking monster, fading to black and a guild wars 3 logo.
---
the other project is guild wars 3
---
They are already account-wide. All characters can already use it them. 
---
But constantly moving them between characters is too awkward and annoying.  
---
Allowing each character to have access to a legendary without constantly switching them between characters in the bank or shared inventory slots is a matter of convenience and QoL since they already have access to it.  
---
But if every character could get them at the same time, there would be less need to re-gear, and the economy would hurt for it.
---
And so it should have a QoL cost. Not too large, not too small, and considering the cost already spent in the legendary.  
---
The middle ground would be having "Legendary replicas". A new convenience feature for accounts that unlock legendary gear.
---
After binding a legendary to the account, what would become unlocked would not be the legendary, but a new item in a new tab the "Recover items" shop from the Legendary vendor.   
---
This item would be usable in the mystic forge along other items to make a replica out of a piece of ascended gear of the same type. 
---
So, for example, it could be like this (and keep in mind the numbers of the costs are just an example, they could be adjusted to be lower or higher):
---
1. Obtain and bind Bolt to your account. 
---
 * Now, on top of having the skin unlocked, a new item is unlocked at Grandmaster Craftsman Hobbs: "Soul of Bolt", a material to use in the mystic foge.  
---
 * Buy the Soul of Bolt mystic forge material for a reasonable price (e.g.: 5 laurels and 5 gold)
---
2. Obtain any ascended sword that can be used in the mystic forge with the Anthology of Heroes recipe (i.e: Caladbolg Rosa would not work since it can't be mystic-forged)
---
3. Obtain the other 2 items for the recipe. For example, items like these: 
---
 * 100 Obsidian Shards * 
---
 * 1 Bloodstone Shard * 
---
 * 10 Mystic Runestones.
---
 * 5 Ectoplasmic Stones.
---
 * Gift of Bolt.
---
 * Gift of Metal
---
 * Gift of Lighning
---
 * Superior Sigil of Air  
---
 I'd recommend going with the more reasonable 100 Obsidian shards and 1 Bloodstone Shard for the price , to make it a sink for karma and spirit shards. 
---
4. Put the Soul, the Ascended Sword and the 2 other items in the Mystic Forge.
---
And you'd get a [Bolt (Replica)] item that looks and works exactly like Bolt, but with a few differenceS: 
---
* In the description, the item rarity line over the item type line says "Replica" instead "Legendary" over the "Sword" line. 
---
* Replicas would also not be usable to obtain any legendary-related achievements like Twice-Told legend. 
---
* Unlike the actual Bolt, it is flagged "Unique Equipped" and can't be equipped along another Bolt or another Bolt replica by the same character, unless you go to Historian Dozza and show two of the real Bolt to her. 
---
 * So after showing two of a legendary to Historia Dozza, replicas of that legendary lose the "Unique Equipped" flag and can be equipped with other Bolts and other replicas. 
---
This way, once you have a full set of legendary gear, you can make replicas for your alts for some extra cost, but first you have to get a full set of ascended gear for them, and so players will still need to re-gear.
---
Hey, I didn't say anything about the details about *what* these people are shouting!
---
There is... elitism...? in claiming that super hardcore raiders have "invested the most into the game," by the way.
---
If someone puts 10,000 hours into open world PvE as a bearbow carebear, and someone else puts 10,000 hours into hardcore raids, which one "invested the most into the game"?
---
To be fair, you have nothing to deny one of cancelled projects was GW3. It's a shroedinger's cat situation we're in about this subject.
---
&gt;Ah, well. Fuck losing ArcDPS. That shit needs to STAY.
---
That shit is a hack that could easily break the game client at some point if a simple mistake is made. Just because it works doesn't mean it should be used. ArcDPS works by hacking through the game and storing things outside it, ANet's templates are integrated into the game which require a lot more technical hurdles as things Arc doesn't have to worry about the integrated Templates DO.
---
There's a reason that it breaks after every update and a reason that it randomly loses track of gear in builds....... it's a hack.
---
No it is not.
---
If u have really dropped enough ascended from fractal only you run enought to be considered rich. It's 20 gold a day T4 recs and cm. Plz stap.
---
Unlimited build slots, unlimited gear slots, unlimited legendaries... One has to wonder, just how overbloated should the game become to satisfy this insatiable urge for cheapskate overoptimization?
---
That’s my main concern and the reason why I would not use the new system. I don’t want to lose the posibility to move my legendarys around.
---
I know, I was poking fun at the fact that it's a supposedly 'poor' medium when the medium works just fine for some of the greatest games of all time. For a lot of people though unless their iphone is putting out PS4 graphics with a full keyboard or controller then they're dismissive of the idea that mobile games can be worth their time.
---
It's not anyone's fault that some players run one build into everything and wonder why they get different results.
---
Except their own...
---
Players who dont run more than one build are fully entitled to do so, but even within one game mode and one profession, say necromancer PvE, you have so much available to you.
---
Then you start talking about PvE AND WvW?? Yeah, gonna need a lot of build templates. At least I will...
---
(Just a reminder PvP build templates are separate)
---
Monster Hunter x TLOZ, etc.
---
&gt; "nobody needs **9000 build templates**, this is a made-up problem!"
---
Remember Guild Wars? Pepperidge Farms remembers.
---
A discussion forum? Something like reddit maybe?
---
Excellent troll. Why are you sending messages online? Stick to snail mail.
---
&gt;  DH is full zerk, on the other hand PI DH is mix of zerk/assassins and thief runes or scholar depending on how well you can flank, same for power firebrand.
---
See, for this example i'm sure if you just did all zerk for both of them you'd be just fine.
---
&gt;Now condi firebrand is a mix of Grieving/sinister/Viper with Balthazar runes earth/bursting sigils, on the other hand Condi quickbrand is full viper with firebrand runes smoldering/bursting sigils.
---
Same thing, I'd bet if you just did full viper or a combo for both of these builds it'd still be fine. 
---
I'm not saying you should have to settle for that or that you're wrong, you're not. I'm just pointing out how you're saying these builds are all vastly different when really they honestly don't seem to be. Is one more optimal than another? Sure. Is one going to save you time raiding because it's more optimal? Probably, though I'd bet that time is negligable. Point is, a lot of these people saying they have 20+ builds really do have that many. A lot of them could also play the game just fine with half that many or less and it really wouldn't change much in the grand scheme of things. 
---
Please also note that I was the one that made the post about template storage being free and I genuinely do think that template storage should have been handled more like it was in GW1 with locally saved txt docs or something that would just hold the build template codes, thus allowing for more than the cap of a measly 24 templates. 24 TOTAL templates is neither alt friendly, nor is it single character friendly. It's an objectively bad implementation and I feel that anet really dropped the ball on that.
---
Theres always that one clod on the forums saying "we'd totally pay for X!" to perhaps get Anet's attention... Even if it's something other games in the industry either already have or do in-game without much fanfare. I'd rather not rely on those types of calls to action as the norm.
---
&gt; ArcDPS works by hacking through the game and storing things outside it, ANet's templates are integrated into the game which require a lot more technical hurdles as things Arc doesn't have to worry about the integrated Templates DO.
---
The opposite is true.  Because of the TOS around the game, ArcDPS has to actually do more work to stay as much in compliance as it can, and the two programs see less of each other by design.  That's a greater technical hurdle than Anet would have, because all that player and gear information is already in the game and all their new systems have to do is connect the two together.
---
Anet may be facing their own technical issues based on how differently they approach the design of the system, and interactivity.  Ok, sure.  They have access to all the data they want and they can build better features with that, and that takes work and introduces challenges.  That's still not a good excuse to try and mischaracterize something that people have worked very hard on as a workaround to stay in relative compliance with the TOS.
---
No gw3 is based on assumptions as much as yes gw3, thats my point.
---
&gt; Unlimited build slots, unlimited gear slots, unlimited legendaries... One has to wonder, just how overbloated should the game become to satisfy this insatiable urge for cheapskate overoptimization?
---
man from 9gag culture i see
---
Sarcasm or not about a forum poll, you're right and I'm also going to assume most with more than 6 builds also have legendary armor, or at least some legendary peices. Carrying 6 builds worth of asc gear in your inventory seems just as inconvenient as having less builds that can be stored. That's gotta be more than a 20 slot bag worth of stuff minimum. The point is, it's a minority within a minority.
---
&gt;I agree with you there. They seem pretty set in stone in what they are doing right now.
---
I actually disagree with this. I think they seem incredibly unsure of what they are currently doing right now. Yes, they know that more living world has to be created on a consistent basis, but MANY of the devs have spoken about how absolutely shit the engine is to work with, like they're constantly playing Jenga and the bottom of the tower is just a single piece. This is why they take so much longer to create content, including skins. 
---
Right now, it seems like there's internal tension, they don't have utmost freedom from NCSoft to do whatever they want, they need to produce profit, but at the same time they would rather be working on literally anything else so they can more easily pump out more skins/content/etc. 
---
It's just not a great look that NCS's only western studio remaining has a single property bringing in any money.
---
&gt; I feel like it's more like some guys using 6+ builds screaming and shouting about how terrible the new system is, and a bunch of other people shouting back that everything is okay and would you please stop yelling.
---
This reads to me like the first group must be wrong since the second group doesn't have an issue (so there must not be an issue and group A needs to get over it). Is that what you meant? If yes, then... NO U I guess. If no, then I read it wrong.
---
But yeah, is it common for people who never use gear swaps to completely fill out bag slots on their characters? I don't know anyone who doesn't play a variety of endgame modes that has bought more than one or two bag slots.
---
Yes
---
&gt; All characters can already use it them. But constantly moving them between characters is too awkward and annoying.
---
Shared inventory slots help, but they are super expensive and not enough of them depending on how much legendary equip you use (I only have a couple weps).
---
Lmaooo good
---
People keep parading around this idea of GW3, but I have seen no evidence that they were working on a GW3. If anything, it was a completely new project unrelated to the GW franchise, or it was a mobile or console GW2.
---
I have no idea when it will open, but I can tell you that the server status is recalculated every Tuesday. When it opens, it will be open for a week.
---
I intended that to be phrased in a way to offend both groups. I may have missed the mark, but that was the intention. Both sides (me too) are wrong for different reasons.
---
My main has all paid bag slots at 20 (one at 32), and only one extra set of gear. I have this to make sure I have enough room for all the loot, though that has lessened in need with recent QoL changes where everything is dropping bags now.
---
Edit: some stuff added/changed, sorry
---
i consider it a thief or mesmer portal
---
Nice, getting your second account to loot with you.
---
jkjk
---
Tbh, The real target audience are people that just want to swap between elite specs on the fly doing casual content. Pretty sure everyone mad about templates is missing that. The target is the largest amount of people, not the players it's most useful too.
---
please eventually do the math and make a post. 
---
Id like to know when does ledgie weapons become worth it. 
---
But you actually have me sold on finally going to work on ledgie armor, becuase of stat infusions.
---
Haha strategy games. Have your ever played starcraft 1,2, rome total war, age of myth and aoe 1-3 on pc to name only a few of the classics of the golden age of strategy games. They are games of years ago and vastly superiour to the downtoned, little screen, touch control smartphone games. Tiny cash shop machines is a better way to describe them. Even oldschool early/mid90's strategy games where 10 times more sophisticated, like civilisation 1/2, dune, c&amp;c etc
---
Ah I see! That’s why I find that my abilities are different in pvp. I bought the game when it first came out, so I’m not new to it, but thing is, I really don’t enjoy pvp and haven’t really tried wvw so from my perspective I’m still going from having one template to two. Just like from the perspective of players playing with the add-on, they’re going from many to only two. 
---
I dare say there are others like me who just enjoy pve and just see this as a fun new feature. But I do totally understand that for some that have more experience in all the variety of gameplay and features of the game and rely on certain aspects and stuff to do what they enjoy the most, replacing what they are used to with a seemingly inferior paid substitute, is going to be rather frustrating. 
---
I was just concerned that I had missed a huge problem or disadvantage and was going to be disappointed. But it seems that the problem will be for “vets” as you put it, that play the game in a different way to me. 
---
I am happy to know that it’s still going to be what I had hoped and am super excited to get the update!! 
---
But I really do hope it is improved for you all soon and that they understand that they are letting down their existing and long-supporting customers.
---
A bit like when they made the game free to play. That did make me a little miffed, knowing I’d essentially paid for something that was now free. 
---
But I still enjoy the game and am glad I’ve had it this long. 
---
Best wishes! And thanks for explaining! :)
---
Baldur's gate 1 and 2 did that.
---
At the beginning of the second opus, you could keep all the gear you saved from the first game.
---
Yeah.
---
3 sets of armor, 3 breathers, 5*2 main hand, 4 offhand, 9 2h and underwater...
---
That makes 44 items. Shared inventory slots are definitely not the place for it, since the limit will probably be 40 eventually, and we still have to put there gathering tools, teleport scrolls, salvage kits, etc...
---
You're saying the people that have a different opinion than you are "screaming and shouting" and you're the one talking about how others don't invite discussion? You don't see the irony do you? 
---
Fact is, there is a very vocal minority (arcdps users with lots of templates) that are very unhappy with how their current game experience will be negatively impacted by an upcoming update. Especially people that move around legendaries between multiple characters will end up in a worse position to now. 
---
I myself mostly play open world casually, so I'll probably not even use these templates, but would it kill you to admit there might be at least one person that isn't just here to brag about being a 1337-raider who is better than everyone else?
---
no.. you can linj it yo other slots and it eill show a symbol to tell you its linked in more than one equipment template.
---
Well hurry up coz it's going to dishappear soon it seems:

---
hm.. depends on the purpose. if you buy bagslots to hold more gear - yes absolute.
---
but a second char wont help you, when you want to have more inventory space for a long dungeon tour or openworld session without going to clear your inventory
---
The childish name calling, that's so adorable.  Like I said, keep trying.  Resorting to personal insults just proves you lack the intellect to form a logical argument.  Your paragraph above is a shining example of it.
---
Or it could not be that at all? Why jump to the worst possible conclusion before they've even announced anything other than the name of the company and the people working there? You're not even giving them a chance.
---
You can see the answer to your question if you read. But starting to doubt your abilities to do so. Your comment was moronic and addressed things I never talked about. Learn to read and not make shit up. Learn how to research. Stop being a pleb. You can literally look at anyone's profile to see their old posts. You've discredited yourself. No one even had to do it.
---
A couple of nights would probably net me 4 to 6 gbs. If the power doesn't go out, which it does nightly at 8pm.
---
Point taken. Yeah.
---
&gt;The fact of the matter is that Anet has undoubtedly been mismanaged. The  amount of content released relative to the number of individuals on  their payroll is disastrous. At this point I guess it's fair to  speculate that for whatever reason their other project has either been  cancelled or shipped off to another studio. If we were to see gw3 it  would have been by now.
---
We don't know that. What we do know is that the layoffs were performed because non-mobile games, while profitable, aren't performing as well as mobile and NCSoft wanted to cut costs. *Could* that mean ANet was mismanaged? YES, but there is no evidence that any such thing was the case. NCSoft clearly wanted ANet to focus 100% on GW2 since it is one of the few consistently profitable PC MMOs they have. That probably didn't sit well with MO and some of the staff working on other projects (which is absolutely normal for a company, especially one involved with technology and in a cutthroat market, to do).
---
MO is a programmer at heart, he probably just wants to go back to doing what he loves.
---
if u have 150 items in ur bag how do you manage it without templates?
---
Created and moderated by Manaworks Developers, no thanks.
---
they don't. Leg weapons were never essentially worth and with build templates they kinda become obsolete, since the only attribute they have is changing stats and swaping sigils. Other than that they provide zero stat boost.
---
The bit you miss in regards to value in new characters is more time played levelling/hero points or whatever, which also means more fashion wars and more skins bought.
---
Look at this guy not wasting his time lmfao. Argument for what? You said you didn't want to even have one. Lol how dumb can you be... I mean really XD. Pick what you want lil flower and we can go from there.
---
Hahaha!
---
The fact that many mobile games are terrible is a reflection of the marketplace and culture, not the medium. There is nothing intrinsic about the phone itself that necessitates bad gameplay or bad business models. As I said: if you can play Minecraft on a phone just fine, then the problem isn't the medium. Are you able to separate anecdotal examples and not generalize to the entire medium? It appears not.
---
As gar as my gamer cred: my first console was a NES, ok? I wasn't there for Atari and Commodore 64, but I know plenty of game history, thanks. And for someone so pissed off I called another uset "Gramps", you sure have a lot of fucking nerve.
---
at lvl 50, you are only a liability in wvw anyways
---
If Mike Z is now CEO he will almost certainly have to step down as Game Director.
---
Man that's so weird, this was the same exact conclusion I came to while I was fuming over her tweet at work.
---
So what's bad about a pve set with agility and a party set with vitality?
---
I should get screwed coz you are lazy? I should buy chairs and skins instead of optimizing my game play?
---
so those that **care** bout 100% crit chance/condi durration should just dont care right :D those that care bout getting the right BD should just suck it up and use the same gear and just deal with the extra BD/crit/cond durration :&gt; just be like a casual, how is it possible for someone to have fun via min maxing!!!!   
---
someone also pointed out, it seems if you change any small trait, you're already editing the template you slotted in. so you have to remember to change it back after that spcific encounter where u changed that 1 thing. or else the next time you load it, it's the already changed template.
---
Look here you little idiot, if you just have one or two posts about mass upset, you don't actually get any point across to ArenaNet at all. It created the impression that there isn't actually a problem, when there damn well is a huge problem with what ArenaNet have been doing for the last several years resulting in a constant divide between the playerbase. This is what has happened for the last fucking 7 years and now look where we are. The community is extremely divided because of white knights suppressing any form of valid feedback from people who love the game in different ways to them.
---
Putting all of the community's upset into one place is hiding the problem from ArenaNet, it's fucking retarded. We need to have upset for an extended period of time or they don't actually get the point. This is exactly how we've ended up with the casual shitfest of non-content that is today's GW2 and this is exactly how the vast majority of the game is severely neglected. Because you fucks try to hide anything you perceive as "negative" when in reality, every person here throwing shit around is simply upset because they're invested in the game, they love it just as much as anyone else here.
---
Don't try to invalidate people's concerns and upset just because it makes you sad to read through it all. Got a suggestion for you, don't fucking read it if you can't handle it. 
---
Jesus fucking Christ this community is so damn broken and unfixable at this point. We need a reset.
---
Hopefuly the Skirmish reward improvements will fix that.
---
First of: me sorry mate.
---
It seems like you are way below the bar of internet connections, maybe a game like Witcher 3 / Tomb rider would be better suited for your situation.
---
Can't you go to a public library, public internet cafe, ask some one with a good office connection...
---
Well If you care to send a letter to Italy  with a USB drive I'll be glad to share my dwl :)
---
Get a UPS for the power downs
---
The age old truth rings true, if you love what you do don't be too ambitious or too good at it (or at least avoid showing it too much lest they say you are either overqualified or better suited for a leadership role).
---
Sadly lesdership role can also mean your practical skills will rust since you don't get the opportunity to use them and keep working on those skills (very relevant in development be it games or software).
---
&gt; I also don’t understand how offering to pay cash for something that saves me a couple minutes of transfering via shared slots is being a cheapskate.
---
Objects need to have constraints that keep their form together, or they fall apart into a gray mass indistinguishable from the next one. Games have to have some rules to preserve their integrity and relative immersion.
---
Some rules *can* be circumvented through inconvenient actions, but them being there is exactly what holds the game together. By asking to remove more and more limitations (character-bound wallet, character-bound gear, character bound inventory, DPS meter and gear inspection...) players are methodically breaking the game into a calculator-shaped meta-experience instead of a fantasy world with individual characters. At some point the developers just have to stop if they don't want the game to turn into a mess of mechanical UIs and systems that have no soul left in them... and that's what the current "hardcore" faction is literally asking from devs for GW2, because they're not enjoying it the way it is presented and wish for it to bend to *their* will.
---
&gt; Well If you care to send a letter to Italy with a USB drive I'll be glad to share my dwl :)
---
LOL, that would be awesome and funny.
---
&gt; Can't you go to a public library, public internet cafe, ask some one with a good office connection...
---
None of that exists here. Everything you can think of, I already did. None of that is possible. Either take a month + to download it or don't play.
---
&gt; It seems like you are way below the bar of internet connections, maybe a game like Witcher 3 
---
I would LOVE to play The Witcher 3. Already beat 2 and gave up on 1, the quest journal really turned me off from the game. But, I can't buy it so there's that. I'll see if I can find a torrent later.
---
We manage the community!
---
Skins or mounts have absolutely nothing to do with inventory congestion. Legendary gear provides the most flexibility when it comes to builds vs inventory space. 1 peice of gear can be any stat you need as opposed to 3-6 different pieces of gear with set stats. The unique skin is just a bonus, which is subjective in itself.
---
I don't get it. ELI5
---
Runescape classic to RS2. 
---
It was the same game for the most part but had a major overhauled engine and graphics as well as a different combat etc and you had a chance to fully copy your stats and items or stay on the classic version.
---
Grrr, I've spent a lot of money to maximize my main, inv slots, world completion, and they keep sayn: hey just BUY 3 other character slot, level up, do HP, buy all gear, get map point ...
---
ArenaNet are a 300 person company that makes millions and millions. 7 years of GW2. GW1 had build templates.
---
Come on man, who gives a shit if they have to pull info together from a handful of databases - like that's a big job. We both know it's not.
---
The fact is that the vast majority of people who wrote GW1 and 2 are gone. The people remaining aren't extremely familiar with the engine and architectures and they get no resources to do anything. Did you watch the Guild Chat about the templates? The person who developed them is just that. One person who developed them. In their free time. That's why it's a shoddy implementation and it has nothing to do with managing a few fucking tables lol.
---
&gt; People who spend more time on the game are likely to play more builds.
---
Nope. People who spend *more* time on the game can be just fine with a single build. 
---
Perhaps what you mean, and would be more accurate, is "people who *make a lot of builds* are likely to play more builds"? 
---
&gt;Similar with your multiple characters argument. I have three warriors, two eles, two guards, two thieves, two rangers, two necros, and one of the other classes. If I desired to buy templates for those classes that use multiple specs, I would have to buy multiple for each character since its by character.
---
And I have one warrior, one ele, two guards, two thieves, one ranger, one necro, one engie, two mesmers, and one revenant, and I don't need to buy any templates because they are already giving me three trait ones and two gear ones, which is well more than I have right now. 
---
&gt;Just because you don't fit into the type doesn't mean it isn't true, because this isn't an issue of hardcore vs rest. It's way more general than that. 
---
That was sort of my point. The people bothered over this are the people bothered over this. They do not lay claim to any special place in the GW2 community. They are not in any way more special or more desirable or more worthy than the majority of the GW2 community for which this change is purely a positive thing. 
---
&gt;Also dismissing by game modes isn't really fair point of discussion. They exist, they are being minimally maintained, and people play them.
---
Yeah, but they also drag resources from other parts of the game *and* complain incessantly that they aren't dragging *enough* resources from other parts of the game, and the game as a whole would likely be better off if ANet just removed those modes entirely so that they would no longer be draining resources and complaining about it.
---
Wut?

[This is the one i enjoy the most](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PawAgiVlZwiYdsMGJW2XbPVA-zRRYBB5Lq0xQBFSdVQmhQFJgaDA-e) ,  mark -&gt; CnD -&gt; Back Stab then fill with Double Strike chain

Dagger Storm when theres plenty of mobs or when you need that healing, thanks to [Payback](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Payback) its CD wont be a problem.

It reminds me a lot of the classic dual daggers rogue that i love!
---
Simply put, outside of shared inventory slots, the back end database doesn't allow this. Only shared inventory slots are account wide while regular inventory slots are not.

See my post here for full breakdown into the technical side of it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dd5m88/equipment\_templates\_offer\_less\_for\_those\_that/f2gdgh1?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dd5m88/equipment_templates_offer_less_for_those_that/f2gdgh1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

And before someone screams about Shared inventory slots and regular inventory showing in the same window - as anyone who has every worked on the front end portion of any PC, Mobile, or Web Application. Code is written to take disparate (though related) data in several locations in a database (or other sources) and display it in a unified way to the player/user. Just because they look like the same system doesn't mean they actually are.
---
Everyone is freaking out of this, but I (someone who just quickly changes my builds manually) am just looking forward to the free slots to put my gear in and don't intend whatsoever to purchase any more slots.
---
8 sets, not full trinkets coz mostly is rune, some is a mix of stats, also infusions are dam expensive,
---
&gt; It's text. There is no fucking sound. 
---
Do you actually not know what he meant, or are you taking it literally? He meant it came across as sarcastic.
---
&gt; what they really should be asking for is at least an extension on arcdps/templates.
---
I can't remember Anet ever backing down on anything like this before, so that'd be a first.
---
I think they made the right *financial* decision - players who can't live without that functionality are going to pay, no matter the cost, or quit. Either more players will pay than quit (profit!) or less likely, the population in the raid scene or less popular game modes like WvW, raids, CM's, whatever goes down and requires less attention (development savings!).
---
I don't think they made the right *service* decision, merely the most profitable one. If they were going to do that, we'd have gotten ArcDPS' template functionality instead of a text string parser and hidden bag slots for cash.
---
Again given the track record, seems like many new systems like this get kicked out the door and let slide, so I don't really know what to hope for after they already spent 2 years over-engineering a downgrade already.

Skritt (on disengage): "That's right, you BITCH!"

I just remember me back when I first tanked her "am I tanking her under her skirt?"
---
Okay, up until 3 three seconds ago I legit thought that smh stood for "so much hate".
---
Mike Tyson is that you?
---
Right now in Fractals you hit arc templates when you clean a group and you start to move to a boss / event / part where you know you'd better change specs.
---
Simple node farm is the best way to get them.
---
All of your points are valid except when you realize that all of your points are ignoring the fact that it's Anet's employees' fucking *jobs* so if they have to deal with backend instability, they should deal with it, and if they have to work with multiple databases, they can just do it. ArcDPS is made by a volunteer, and paid employees cant figure the shit out?
---
Maybe you're wrong and they just want the money or to see how people react before increasing the limit.
---
So what's the point?
---
If someone likes to play smart, even in open world with the best crit chance possible?
---
I only do open world PvE and WvW, I have 15 of my 23 characters maxed on bag slots.  Now you know one.
---
The things you people complain about
---
You basically just slingshot past my point there and went into the technical implications of their *chosen design* and how functionally it's more difficult because they chose a server side solution and they're trying to plug it into everything.
---
If Anet wanted to make ArcDPS, it would be easier for Anet.  Client side, local copy, access to any api they ever wanted to set up (a lot which already exist for outside use, mind you), and maybe if they really wanted to save it, something compressed and sent/associated with an account after the fact.  ArcDPS breaks with each update because of a predictable set of changes and the fact that they're not telepathic.  To conclude that the whole thing is just a hack that barely works on that basis is inane.  They're not exactly allowed to coordinate release with Anet's patches, so they're always going to lag behind just a little.  Anet could update at the same time as any client updates roll out, because Anet owns the schedule- and for that matter they wouldn't need to implement those updates since it's not like they have to hook into *themselves.*
---
Anet chose to make their templates this hooked into their system, so they chose a structure this monstrous to contend with. We're only pretending this is the "proper" solution because they chose to say it's the proper solution.  Sure, I'll applaud the decision to go further, and I get it's a harder task based on what they chose to do. I do think it warrants the question whether it was the right choice though, because that choice does restrict templates to characters as you pointed out- a big part of the appeal of a template system to players was the idea of sharing templates, and they chose a way that's harder and can't easily do that, and that probably costs them more in terms of space and effort.
---
I don't think 'but it's so big and elaborate because we made it that way' is an acceptable excuse here, just like whenever d3d9 and cpu performance are brought up, or when my guildies crack a joke about how Anet is trying to introduce dungeons *again* with another name because they just can't be bothered to figure out how the originals work.
---
By design, gw2 motivates people to be proactive in helping others (instanced drops and 1334 exp for revival, yeaaah) and the elite PvE content is easy enough to let anyone handle all the content with minimal investment, thus except in HC /semiHC guilds there is not that much hate in game, even in endgame content IMHO
---
Yes. If its easier to change builds, people are more likely to use more builds. An example is build variations between encounters. Maybe a different traitline, or even only a few minor differences, would be better for a specific encounter. Most people arent going to keep making those changes currently, be it because they might make a mistake in adjusting the build or because they dont remember what changes to make off the top of their head. Improved QoL in regards to builds would mean players are more likely to run more builds.

I got married and then my wife started just watching TV instead, lol
---
Yeah, I'm here. I'm not the one who said he didn't want to waste time XD. I'm off of work so I got the time to spend. Funny you didn't argue that fact you're a troll and call people snowflakes despite actually being one XD. How many holes does this guy have in his mental state XD. I don't know about a fan but definitely won't take anything you ever say seriously. As you keep wasting your time spewing dumb shit but never make an actual argument XD.
---
If they make a mobile MMO with controller support and non-garbage game design, it could be worth playing.
---
Not saying I wouldn't prefer to play on PC, but it's POSSIBLE to make a good mobile game. Nobody does it, though.
---
Thank you, I've never played wow
---
Personally, i set my inventory to 12 slots wide and store a full set om each line. It makes swapping gear out fairly simple, although templates would definitely make that easier.
---
Mmmm nope, sorry! You're grossly incorrect. A template is merely a string of letters and numbers that takes maybe, MAYBE, a few hundred bytes. Say we get a hundred templates, and all gw2 players have the maximum 79 characters.
---
That's about 2,000,000 people (being VERY generous with "active" players) x 79 characters x 100 templates x 500 bytes (being VERY generous) = 7900 Gb, or basically 8Tb. You can pick up a nice fresh 8Tb mechanical drive for about 200-250 bucks, or a couple 4Tb ssds for about a thousand bucks.
---
Oh, and 100 templates actually *is* unreasonably high, 2M people is incredibly far beyond reality, and it definitely doesn't take 500 bytes of alphanumeric text to create a template unless I'm missing something.
---
Now your just regurgitating, this is going downhill.  Try harder and maybe this thread will regain it's entertainment value.
---
For a while, I didn't know what "smh" meant, so I decided that until someone used it with enough context to convey a better meaning, I would respond as though they were saying "smell my hand."
---
Most people reacted negatively to that.
---
Kotaku made an article recapping the letter and claiming "sources" say that one of the scrapped projects was a new Guild Wars game and the writer assumed that meant Guild Wars 3 which got scrapped.
---
Of course, this is ignoring the *fact* we now know they had a mobile GW game in the works as we've seen art done for it. So if the writer wasn't bullshitting, said source likely meant that.
---
Not when he reads it out loud...then it must sound like a struggle and little else
---
If your source of GW3 comes from the kotaku article, that was highly speculative BS.
---
There's no solid foundation for a GW3 speculation. There was only 2 projects, and one was a GW mobile game. We have zero indication what the second was.
