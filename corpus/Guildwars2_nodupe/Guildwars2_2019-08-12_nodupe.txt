So? Lots of things are. The average player probably doesn't even know the meme and when told that "ERP stands for something else" they'd most likely google it and find "Enterprise Resource Planning".
---
we know thats a lie lol
---
NO ERP IN DORMS
---
Gw2 cant even fix they patches lmfao , Anet drunk
---
I hadn't actually thought of it this way. I guess GW2 has just spoiled me by setting the standard for combat, with social aspects falling by the wayside.
---
The production value... how does one even get those camera shots??
---
Teapot has the personality and charisma to do it.
---
Easy. We create **gemstore tournaments** and then we will have *infinite content*, and the **gemstore tournaments** count as hardcore content because it has **tournaments** in the name, everyone is happy ezpz

&amp;#x200B;

I think 'ilovethisdeadgame' has single handedly prevented Anet from ever doing that again.
---
Thanks, like I said, not familiar with them at all and got a little chuckle as I was scrolling through today.
---
I feel you!
---
Sure but JS you literally don't need any stealth other than pistol 5 / dagger 2 combo and the stealth heal skill, with shadow arts I believe that's already more than 100% uptime.
---
Dont you mean an unladen European Swallow?
---
Thanks for your insight, I'll keep that in mind.
---
Okay, I'll look into it, thanks! :)
---
Unrelated, but do you know any VOD with the (close to) optimal dragonfall meta showcased? I tried it today for the first time and it was a disaster. One of the reasons being that the commander was very bad, but I was so lost. Also I don't have skyscale and the commander only used it, should I ignore DF until I get skyscale?
---
Now this is content
---
I got two precursors from blue unids back when they were PoF only.
---
if it wasn't accurate then people wouldn't be leaving. 
---
&gt; The "hardcore" raiding community has always been full of whiny entitled little shits.
---
on the contrary, there have been many times "whiny entitled little shits" who suck at the game have come to reddit and complained about how raiders wouldn't take on dead weight and carry them through raids in their masterwork gear.
---
I don't have the skyscale, don't have the roller beetle, and don't care. I quit playing "catch up" with guildies and players and don't look back - I have a life to live, and GW2 isn't it.
---
Sorry, but I'm not up to date with GW2 sadly. Why is it the last one?
---
Most of the top (aka hardcore) raiding guilds have been bleeding players to other games, specially because ANet has been really slow to deliver harder endgame content.   
---
Will be really hard to organise something like this again.
---
Ah, well. I've never played thief before and honestly use this character more for RP so I never really looked. (shrug) Thank you tho.
---
Perfect, I'll get them since I have a lot of karma anyway and I don't care about inventory space for now.
---
I've already read that doc from your guide, but I'd prefer actually seeing from a POV how to do it, one of the reasons being to learn when to use each mount because the commander always uses skyscale and I got stuck several times trying to follow with my available mounts, either because I fell, unmounted damaged by minions and couldn't mount back in time or because I just couldn't reach the path somehow. If there's no PoV examples I'll have to learn the hard way I guess!
---
This is not a survey. This is a 'change my mind' post.
---
A PvP cheater/wintrader who thinks he is good because he makes YouTube montages farming WvW up-levels in zerg builds.
---
Can confirm. I instantly stopped playing guildwars 2 after getting the saddle, because the farm sucked all the motivation I had for guildwars.
---
So this is it huh? The last event worth caring about in Guild Wars 2. One last hurrah before everyone that cares moves on.
---
It's been a slow and sad death of instanced content in this game, but here it is. Dungeons are dead, Raids are dead, Fractals are dead.
---
Bittersweet knowing what this event means, but I'll be watching.
---
what in damnation have you done?
---
No, what's actually boring is the fact that everyone uses Berserker in PvE because it's the only set that works well. Contrary to what a lot of people say, this has watered down combat and character building.  
---
But, even if it's what's desired, fine, why do defensive stats exist, then? They're less than useless. They actually harm your ability survive.
---
Are POI and Vistas account wide or character based?
---
How about waypoints?
---
you miss out on the biggest fact that is called skill.  
---
you can have two players with the same gear, boons and one is pulling 35k while the other one barely scratches at 25k and a lot more who never learned any rotation won't get over 15k.  
---
makes the discussion already pointless, because the whole system can't ever include all kinds of people.
---
&gt;They're less than useless
---
They are in most of PvE, yes, and that's completely fine. Making defensive stats better won't change this fact.
---
You could fulfil your tank fantasies where you passively absorb damage through gear in other MMOs. This one isn't it
---
All character based. New characters will have no PoIs or Vistas unlocked and only the default starting waypoints (like those in each of the starting zones)
---
You have posted bitter posts all throughout this thread attacking people and communities. It's clear that you're the one who emotionally reacts to this discussion.
---
there is no issue. its intended that passive defenses in this game do not provite as much...just as active combat rewards you with way more damage then just pressing 1 with a dps build.
---
I would guess probably about the same number of teams. Just minus some big names.
---
People who play GW2 -&gt; Who raid in GW2 -&gt; Who care about speed clearing -&gt; Who care enough about speed clearing to be top of the top
---
That pool of players is so insanely small that it is essentially insignificant.
---
I mean, it's less a meme and actually the acronym for in-character typefucking.
---
I was replying to what was said in the post. Highways tend to have less traffic jams than where I live, however.
---
Zelda dungeons remade with GW2 mechanics.
---
You're ignoring vitality, and pvp(both spvp and wvw).
---
prolly should have chosen a different name
---
The master salvage kit affects the upgrade drop chance (ectos, lucent crystals, charms and symbols). I'm pretty certain they don't change the drop rates of the leather/ore/wood that you get.
---
I just leveled up 2 toons by teleport to friend to HOT metas/df/Jahai/PoF HP trains, works great
---
I just gotta say, the Toxic cover and the ERP initials are solid gold and whoever thought of them for this should be showered in praise.
---
It is ridiculous to talk about it because you and i both know that nearly all of them are afk. And both you and i know that there is even tools to use that will poke you if you get poked in game by a gm whilst you afk farm. They even admitted such things. And were i agree it happens that they do get banned because funny enough all those clusters of players that stand on one spot 24/7 for weeks if not months they all vanish after such a check up. Those check ups are done way to rarely and new afk spots shows up every day and make the game look like a bot farm. 
---
Imo they are the trash of this game that profit on nothing and Arena Net are ok with that. Adding yet another way to abuse is nothing i want, which i already said. I am sorry if that is not what you want me to answer but that is my answer.
---
They increase the odds of getting the next tier. I.e. hard leather instead of thick leather
---
Learn to not stand in the red and you will survive longer.

If you want another epic fanmade trailer, this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gHsliMTzhg) is brought back time and time again as a phenomenal hype trailer for Living Story Season 1/2. (Intense spoilers for both of those seasons, obviously.)
---
Honestly, do what's fun. The skyscale is great, but not worth throwing away your leisure time over. I'd suggest just doing things you enjoy in the living world 4 maps, and spend the volatile magic in Dragonfall for the currencies you need. You'll get it soon enough, and won't have to deal with as much suffering.

Pretty certain they don't.  Easy to test anyway, use a BL salvage kit on medium gear a bunch of times, if they only give hardened leather then you are right, if they give thick leather then you aren't.

I'm kind of at a lose for words here in that I find it really intriguing and somewhat repulsive at the same time(it has that whole monster vibe going on) but what ever your take on it the level detail and the casual almost still life take on it is unnerving. Great Work in that it makes really look at it and think about your reaction to it is.

It's not a technical issue, it's an Anet policy issue from what is understood on the situation.

That's not the reason it isn't officially supported. You're so wrong you made me thing two realities collided or some shit.

Very little, actually.
---
Guardian, in general, will always have access to defensive/supportive Virtues, even in DPS builds. It's not uncommon for DPS Guardians to take a trait in the Virtues traitline that makes Virtue of Resolve cleanse conditions on themselves and allies, which alone is huge QoL. 
---
Firebrand, in particular, has tons of heals, cleanse, and boons, but none of that is going to be very potent unless you build into stats such as Healing Power and Concentration, which is why I recommend DH more for solo survivability.
---
Nobody should be allowed to leave school before learning the magical print screen
---
To add onto what derek said, you can also use the Virtues traitline and use the trait Monk's Focus, which will lowe the cooldown of all Meditation skills, including Litany of Wrath, as well as cause them to give a large additional heal to yourself and grant Fury in an AoE.
---
Monk's Focus is a very staple trait for nearly all Guardian (DH/Firebrand) builds.
---
sorry I dont think that's true. and I did what you're suggesting in my post, I said what content I like and what kind of person I am
---
I'd heavily recommend Core Ranger. 
---
It's super simple, safe, and you can just pew pew from range while still being very effective.
---
Not too much has happened in last few months. So that is a plus point. Story wise that is. I recommend just playing through story from where you last were. Set a target and work towards it.
---
Are we even getting a Season 5 any time soon? Season 4 looked like it was the end of Guild Wars 2. I was expecting the story to be carried forward in Guild Wars 3 or suttin'
---
not in your christian game, eh?
---
yea, I lost it :(
---
I think he's talking about it [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon\_Bash\_Merchant\_(Weekly)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon_Bash_Merchant_(Weekly)) but it's weekly anyway, but it's already better than 5 a day in dragonfall haha
---
It's strange because I've been here since launch and raiding is a lot stronger today than it was in 2012/2013 or 2014. The addition of raids was new to HoT.
---
&gt; If a large part of the vocal community downplays all your problems with the game by saying 'go away we dont need you', especially when pretty much all guides and out of game content are made by those guys they're telling to quit, people just grow apathetic and do quit.
---
Why do you are about what people say? ArenaNet have metrics - how many people raiding, how many people doing new raids, how many people doing challenge motes, how many repeating old raids etc. That tells ArenaNet a lot more than when the weekly bitch thread on reddit chooses raids to bitch about.
---
&gt; Enduring years of increasingly less support for your preferred gamemode with promises of increasing support that has never actually happened, plus all given feedback for said mode being responded to with 'go play another game', people will give up on giving feedback and the game soon enough.
---
Poor persecuted raiders, how much it must suck to be us. People have fabricated this nonsense idea that raids in GW2 are somehow much worse off than other game types and that everything is sunshine and rainbows for other types of content. For starters, raiders are usually like WvW players - they play most game modes, not just raiding. The idea that it's us (raiders) vs them (story/WvW/fractal/casuals) is just wrong, it's us vs us which is just silly. It's also not the job of "casuals" to take care of your feelings about raids or release cadence.
---
The reality is raids never naturally fit into GW2 (that's not to say it's not possible, just that ArenaNet didn't do it well). The game was built from the ground up without a trinity, a staple in the most popular raiding games. The combat system doesn't naturally accommodate the types of gameplay that work well in traditional raiding MMOs. Even once you get past that, the decision to only have one difficulty of raids (later a pseudo second difficult with motes) is the biggest problem. Raids in WoW have a very high level of participation because it has varying levels of difficulty. Varied difficulties open up raids to be central pieces of the story because you're not locking 95% of your players out of ever experiencing the final boss of an expansion anymore. GW2 never accommodated the lowest skilled group of players, which divided the community, and to be fair, the most hardcore raiders often advocated against lower difficulty _options_ for raids which certainly didn't help that divide. Just look at the GW2efficiency data that tracked the completion rates of the more recent raids and it becomes clear they are not engaging players as much as other content in the game. All kinds of reasons for this contributed (hostility within the raiding community is one of the biggest factors) but here we are now.
---
All of GW2 imo, aside from maybe story instances, is struggling atm. Only the most casual of open world content players are satisfied by the new maps, most people one and done them. The decline in interest for GW2 is a global trend across all game modes (if nothing else, the game is seven years old), it's not something the special snowflakes in the hardcore scene of raiding have a monopoly on.

Tip: Don't rush it. Just play the LS4 maps. You'll get them eventually.
---
Or you can PvP for them.
---
You can't upgrade the exotics, no.  Unless you want the skins, the only reason to ever craft them is for this one particular achievement.
---
You can try to Mystic Forge it, of course, if you don't want to salvage.
---
We all know Anet supports one thing. The gemstore.
---
Ghostly Infusion + edgy dark armor + eddy dark weapon + over saturation + to much sharpening

Nice video. Really. Much better than anet standard trailers.
---
Still I could not care less about raids and this did not changed my mind. Downvite me to hell but there are dozens of us, dozens.
---
the problem was that he got everything gifted and I mean everything because people thought that would be a good idea..he had no reason to play for him self anymore.
---
That’s a bad mindset to have and isn’t even true. Players that are “just bad” just haven’t learned yet or aren’t trying to learn. If you actually want to do raids, you can easily gear a power dps class in exotic armor and weapons for a few gold, and get ascended trinkets from lws3 maps and login rewards, learn your rotation on golem, and join a training group. The only thing stopping you is you.
---
Lulw it’s not gliding
---
I’d be happy just to have the section of the map be shown in world map once the place is discovered.
---
Same deal with Caudecus’ Mansion and Arah.
---
3rd party software that anet disapproves of

This is such a mood it hurt my soul just reading and remembering
---
I don’t think anything shows a person as more incompetent than them taking a picture of their computer screen with their phone when hey could just as easily screenshot.
---
True, the main thing I just wanted to look at was the discrepancy between Direct Salvage and ID and if Rude\_Asura's post from 4 months ago changed.  Even in this sample size, the results are clear that ID is much better than direct salvage (Even though the discrepancy may not be accurate, due to the sample size).  I've probably gone through at least 10k+ green bags at this point, I'm just a bit too lazy to record the data.
---
Oops. Well that's unfortunate, it makes their game look incredible
---
Besides the past conflicts they have had with each other the reason is simple.
---
They have seen what has happened to western countries that opened themselves up to everyone from everywhere else &amp; have decided that either you can respect their culture or GTFO.
---
But that's 15 days worth of dailies, how can one grind such a crazy amount of gold?
---
/s
---
Yeah I'm at that play for 1 week each new episode stage. I don't see how they could ever make a change that would fix that issue for players.
---
It took me about 3-4 weeks of playing almost everyday for 4 hours to get to lvl 80.  Another week to finish my personal story.
---
You know what would be better? 1 guild, multiple chat room type things. See FFXIV. 1 Guild. Multiple "linkshells". It. Just. Works.
---
Know your class inside out. (Assuming this is for power)
---
If you do know your class, can you guarantee that you won't die with full nomad gear? If yes, then proceed to Marauder. If you're still going strong, berserker with power food and oil.
---
If you can't pass with nomad gear, don't play the class.
---
Will do thank you so much
---
Dragonfall actually has merchant that lets you buy 5 currencies for volatile magic per day per account, so that particular option is not limited to Dragon Bash merchant. Better than nothing but still stupid amount for someone who anyone who has one or two toons.
---
To add to what u/Zoshin and u/JheroBet have said, I have 2 people I know that had literally never raided before (one may have had killd VG when W1 was released a long time ago) and on of them had a fractal level in T3. I started a raiding group with them and a mix of people who had some limited experience and some people with medium experience. After 3-4 weeks (2 raid slots per week, 2h each and since 2 weeks a 3rd optional spot just for the "mastered bosses" just to get some loot) here is the result:
---
* W1 mostly mastered but not everybody know how to do canons and kiting yet on Sabetha
---
* W2 is ok-ish, still a few issues on Sloth when shit hits the fan but Matthias is smooth thanks to Boon Thief
---
* KC DPS is fine but push is still a bit wonky (still good enough to kill)
---
* Cairn, MO, Samarog is mostly mastered but still a few shockwave issues
---
* Deimos was killed once last week
---
* Adina was killed once last week
---
Most of the low-experience players only have 1-2 build available and most of the intermediate players have 3-4 builds.
---
So all in all if you want to try out raids try to find some raiding training community or some friends to start a group with (but do not go using training LFGs as your only source of raiding because it is a really bad experience to live).
---
To gear a character [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) is very good and useful for you knowing that Trinkets + Weapons are what will give you the most stat/damage benefits and that getting ascended armor (the most expensive part) really is the last thing you should do when upgrading.
---
Raiding will give you some drops to help upgrade or at the very least some currency that you will be able to build up! Note that the 1st collection of the Legendary Armor (requires kills from W1-2-3 with no other special thing) gives a completely free, any stat selectable, ascended armor to help you push forward!
---
Most of WoW plebs dosn't like how piano is gw2
---
Especially considering it was initially handled in private between anet and teapot. I can see why anet wouldnt want to associate in any way to flyhacks. But they could just have all pretended that they gave teapot some access to dev tools. A white lie for the sake of the community.
---
Or maybe that was just a shit excuse and anet management hate teapot's guts. Who knows.

This is the cost of crafting entire exotic armour set. It is actually pretty cheap compared to others. You need 400 leatherworker crafting. As far as I remember, marauder intricate gossamer insignia recipe is available in all the npc crafters and armour parts are crafted by discovering them in crafting tab unlike other new stats

Why will you never finish vision? You wasted some time, but it's not that much time over all. Other achievements are attainable.

Their support team can help you.
---
Actual content. The time I have to spend on the game is pretty much exclusively used for raiding, even if it's only once every month. There's just nothing interesting outside of it.
---
Don't rush. No point in it. So what that you play half an hour per day? It will take some time but you'll get there. Just be patient. The mount won't go anywhere.

Thanks a lo for ur help u saved me a large amout of time \^\_\^

It's a waste to salvage stacks period, you're better off selling the stacks if you're too lazy to open them
---
Unrelated, have you played through Draconis Mons?
---
Do I really need to clip the stream and contact admins to report breaking site-wide rules breaking to prove my point? I don't want to do that because promoting ERP would be that much harder in that case, but some pepos like you are becoming a little bit too delusional. Don't fuck up this for Teapot, use your brain.
---
I dont have screenshots, but Exalted Shoulders fits very good to the Requiem Armor. At least on Asura.
---
Chiming in, but Shadow Arts adds Stealth to steal from just equipping the traitline, and from what I remember, only DE needs a target to use Steal/Deadeye's Mark. So there's Swipe's stealth if you need it. I'd probably also suggest the initiative regen signet and the regen initiative in stealth trait so you can do your stealth combo a bit more frequently if there's stealth stacking issues or feel that the extra buffer is needed for whatever reason.
---
Good trailer but I don't care for raids.
---
I started GW2 in 2012 because I was tired of raiding for years in WoW.
---
GW2 was always a casual game. Why put resources into something only 1-3% of the playerbase wants
---
Sand shark: Let's kick you through the air for a bit because you aren't paying attention to me.
---
I am not sure in which way SC2 was a "disaster", it's THE most popular RTS game on twitch and even received two expansions. The main problem is also the popularity of consoles. Most publishers try to publish their games on as many platforms as possible to generate maximum profit. But with today's controllers, you can't develop an RTS with decent controls on a console. And console users with mouse and keyboards are the exception, not the rule.
---
You mentioned both salvage kits but its unclear to which samples you applied which kit...
---
I know, and teapot said he was happy to discuss changing the name for future events with them. And they were still not interested, so why bother changing it :P

Short answer is yes, however 4winds festival and ls4 zones have made people focus on other priorities.  It is speculated among my circle of friends that as we approach the Aug 30th announcement, more players will be focusing more on gold farming (to hedge against the uncertainties ls5 will bring), which will increase the activity rate of traditional farms, including silverwaste.  Also let's not forget a new generation of players are still maturing into the game where silverwaste is still a critical part of maxing their core tyria masteries.
---
For me they are for notigication whats going on. Organized TT announcements or someone starting open lead on some borderland.

8% think this event does not add value to the subreddit.

That sucks, thanks for the info

If only it was possible to google 'griffon guide GW2', I've never tried it myself but assuming it isn't possible as OP posted 'Help with getting the griffon' here instead.

It is meant to be finale of your 2 years of playing of whole season, on all maps as they released. If you rush it all at once, then it is no surprise that it is tough.
---
ye, unfortunately, though I'd still recommend contacting support in case something has changed over the years as they have been given more ability in their CS tools so it may be something they added.
---
If they do manage to change it, it'd be nice to know so i can tell my friend to ask them again.

\- Make epic trailer for update, follow Black Desert style, for example PearlAbyss last trailer is Shai, they use mod and tool to tweak camera and visual, they even add backward donkey ride, which is not available ingame.

\- Implement all good addons/mods.

Hello, I tend to buy a scimitar, but i have an awfully claw grip. Do the profiles change automaticly after switching the game?
---
I'll try remembering this, thanks a lot. And no, I don't have griffon yet, any workarounds? :D I need griffon to farm gold and gold to unlock the griffon hmmm sad
---
Reason I am asking is because there used to be build guids made by people doing this.
---
I recently returned to the game and want to try it out a bit but so much has changed for my main classes that I don’t really know where to start.
---
I haven't tried fractals yet, and honestly have absolutely no idea where to begin with them lol
---
nobody suggested to just use dodge through the smoke field... As daredevil use the power DPS dodge. It's also a leap finisher = stealth upon using in a smoke field.
---
&gt;  In comes a max level player, one-shots it, AAAAAAand you didn't get the loot &gt; Repeat
---
And just like that we all know you didn't play it.
---
If you use the search bar of this sub you can probably find the recent solos I was talking about. You can probably find some of relatively recent dungeon records on [Gw2 page on speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/gw2#Dungeons), after that it will be mostly be down to digging them up from Reddit or Youtube search functions.
---
I can help for the "so much has changed I don't know where to start"  part though if you want \^\ ^
---
What were you main classes and and roughly when did you stop (ie. was there already the 3 specializations to pick or was there still the points points to put on the 6 trait lines as you wanted, when/before/after HoT released, etc)?
---
There is no original idea within humanity anymore. We all stand on the sh oulders of others. It's a simple fact of how we work as a species.
---
I play Elementalist and I stopped around LS4E01.
---
I never really explored Weaver much as it seems inefficient for open world. Haven’t gotten back into raiding yet.
---
This is more or less all kinda crap.
---
1. Defensive stats don't scale that way; they give you more time until you reach your next set of defensive cooldowns and heals. If you get enough passive damage reduction you'll become immortal by cycling active defenses. If they were tuned higher it'd be trivially easy to become indestructible.
---
2. In PvE it depends on whether you're able to survive a mechanic in a fight or not. You deal no DPS when dead.
---
3. You aren't supposed to use defensive stats *in raids or high-end fractals* no. If you aren't good enough at the game to survive on the back of your defensives in other areas, then you should be using defensive stats.
---
4. You shouldn't design a video game for people who cannot play it.
---
5. You *do* invest in active defense by using your utilities, weapon slots and trait slots on it. Even on a basic moment-to-moment level, you invest time that could otherwise go into DPS when you dodge.
---
6. No thanks, we have enough stats.
---
Erotic Raiding Party*
---
That was a joke, just in case you didnt understand.
---
I recommend that everyone buys an invisible/safe bag. So they can store their Ubud bag in there so when you click salvage all you don't also salvage the bags.
---
Jeez. People are still bitching about this? 
---
You wait till you have to do aurora lol
---
Well. PoE is better than ever (aside release night stability, as usual). grim Dawn is the great game that keeps being updated. Wolcen would be possible next semi-popular game.
---
Hell I would say ARPG is in better state than most of other PC genres. If you take loot shooters Warframe is **only** "good" choice atm (maybe Desteny 2 after steam rerelease). 
---
Shooters... well, last one I actually played were Battlefield 2 and CS 1.6, would not judge. 
---
RTS did not have any new after wh40k and SC1. 
---
Turn based strategies are dead with HoMM3 the only popular game that is TWO! decades old. Civ6 would be good game maybe in another 5 years of extencive modding. AoW Planetfall is awful cheap clone of Endless Legend (with for the most part with Endless Space 2 only new good games)
---
Grand Stratagies = Paradox are is worst shape ever. HoI4 2 years +4 DLC in became 1.0 game. Stellaris is still hot mess. imperator rome was INSULT to paid customers getting alpha release as full game. 
---
And your final cherry is MMO. If you are not into sub fee WoW out of window. If you want endgame/pvp content GW2 out of window. If you are not into aniume stuff FF also... ESO? well I would not call that the best MMO ever. Only reasonoble MMO atm is EVE-Online... with is VERY VERY specific pvp game.
---
What I meant is that no video could bring ppl to raids. Cool or not. Most community do not care about raids.
---
I'd be surprised if it doesn't go on sale for the birthday or lw5 announcement
---
What salvage kit should be used on the blues and greens? Basic?
---
Incredible job!
---
Area 51 Raid :D
---
&gt; Clarify: Its sad that the community only really cares and supports PvE raiding. PvP and especially WvW is kicked to the curb when threads come up for it and I wish the community cared more about other game modes. Thats all
---
That's because players and community that did care and did promote both WvW and PvE left after it became painfully obvious that Anet doesn't, just like the raiding community is now leaving. Not sure how long you've been playing the game, but both the PvP and WvW community was there and Anet did nothing for them.
---
Update: I was stoned as shit. This sub is toxic. Never posting here again.
---
Did you use Silvers inventory to csv tool to record the droprates or are there more efficient ways for such large sample sizes? 
---
It took me quite a while to get 200k  recorded for my spreadsheet, I can't imagine doing several millions that way.
---
I'm skeptical. Can you link me to a peer reviewed paper that proves this?
---
&gt; allowing **low skill or disabled players** a more controlled and **friendly** experience within the game. Do you agree or disagree with this being a **good thing**? If you disagree, please explain why.
---
now that's a loaded question!
---
Let's hope season 5 is as awesome as it could be, with content that feels like a whole expansion. We are so starved on information that I tend to believe the leaks from last months here on reddit are true, it would even explain the whole north and ice stuff that the new logo has and the little bits of information from the buffed interview (exploring Norn and Charr races more in the future). 
---
Even that_shaman's new obsession with the animations point in the same direction, but maybe it's just me seeing things.
---
This is why I like the GW2 dev team yes they may not talk about stuff coming up but devs like Tom here get so excited about a topic and want to continue. Also its nice he is recognising that there could some radio silence up to the announcement but they decided to do this to show the community they are still doing stuff. I have one issue though this should have been a game wide AMA about the last 7 years and it could have ended on the 27th when the anniversary happens maybe this is something the devs could organise for the community on the forums.
---
I love you Roy ♡
---
They were on sale during last years anniversary sale, so good chance they'll go on sale again this year.
---
Is it? Holy moly!
---
"...just aren't good at the game" is a sorry excuse for people who simply refuse to step outside their "oh nice and friendly community" comfort zone and give only a wee bit of effort to accomplish something. You want to be "bad"? Fine, but don't bitch when more hardcore players ask for challenging content with bullshit like "ayy content I can't play".
---
While that is true I still can't think of a scenario in which you would require taking such a large amount if screenshots in such a short time frame. Appreciate the fyi though
---
It's simple. They choose not to.
---
Can you link the leaks ?
---
What do you mean piano? That it's too slow?
---
I've enjoyed the friendliness of this community, but somehow ended up going solo through the story (including expansions). I would love to find a good guild to run with so that i can truly experience this amazing player base. The videos that I've seen of fractal runs pretty much showed me that it is not advised without a tutor or some form. That's why at the moment I've focused on PVP, and slightly touched WvW.
---
They're probably referring to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/canavs/thought_i_leaked_cute_might_delete_later_funny/).
---
If he was the narrative director for the last couple of episodes aswell than he can keep his hype to himself.
---
Horribly boring story telling with one deus ex machina after another doesn't get better from one moment to another.
---
&gt;The most efficient way by far is to just grind hearts with alts and to buy them every day in Dragonfall and that was one of the most boring things I've ever done in GW2.
---
Amen. So glad it's over.
---
Staff tempest healer can. Lightning Flash to the orb and fire 4 back.
---
I’ve been doing that. Then I realized things got so easy no one really needs help anymore. 
---
So I started playing the trading post. It’s kind of sad the only thing bringing me back to the game is speculative trading after an update release notes gets posted.
---
Gots lots of useless gold now though.
---
That's only for season 3 currencies
---
Ha, well I don't think it's specific to WoW players, (MMO)RPG's in general have always been more about chill and slow pacing than other games. Hence why WoW and FFXIV are more popular than more action type B&amp;S/BDO or GW2 (which is already quite slow paced compared to pure action MMO's).
---
you can solo kite on warrior, and used to be able to on chrono ( not sure since the shatter nerf ), and scourge. I dunno about other classes but you probably can do it with most other classes if you understand the kiting and the class enough
---
My bad!
---
Production wise this one seems like is gonna be better (is probably the last one so teapot going out with a bang) 
---
gameplay wise this is gonna be the worst one, only Lucky noobs and Snowify (the leftovers of snowcrows and quaniify) are actually good, the rest are a bunch of plebs that are filler (couldnt even find 8 teams, so we have 6) because the rest of the hardcore guilds and players have left the game in masses  this last year
---
No, you would still be able to dodge. But tying it to a stat (which was how it worked before the beta) would make dodge levels a matter of build choice and would also give vitality a role that was separate from toughness - specializing in helping you avoid big damage.
---
srsly! tell them to watch vidz and get better from it!
---
awesome burst kill!
---
Guess you can do it with a spellbreaker right?

I use copperfed for blues, runecrafter for greens, mystic/master for yellows.
---
A lot of people are saying that ANet should put in the work to make advertisements like this just to advertise the game. Make the game look like the epic, awe-inspiring world and combat system that it is, not some random videos of a bunch of charr running forwards with no changing camera angle.
---
To add - If you want to be super-optimal, you should also merch any masterwork items that you get that don't salvage into either wood or leather.
---
Aren't yellows better with mystic? The upgrades' price dropped a lot since the new system's release :/
---
W6 not w7
---
&gt; actually thinking and using strategy
---
You do this in zergs too if you join a fight guild. Sounds like you've only ever followed brainless pugmanders never in comms, everyone in one party. It's a pity most people get a taste of that then think that's the *only* way zergs are.
---
Nice!! Parabéns! Sempre é bom ver a comunidade BR na ativa.
---
Teapot is using a ToS breaking camera tool. They said they'd support on the condition that he didn't use it. He declined the support offer due to finding the tool too essential.
---
And barely anything new as well.
---
Look, more numbers being magically conjured.
---
Hold your words to yourself.
---
Was actually super easy with dragonfall and festivals allowing you to get those for alternate work instead of grinding the maps eternally.
---
For the most part GW2 still looks pretty good. It just doesn't run very good.
---
Really fortunate to hav passionate devs who cares so much, been playing the game on and off for years and it just gets better and better. Now more hyped than ever for aug 30th.
---
condi specs in pve rely on expertise (condi duration) to be effective because you need the condi's to stack for damage. Burning is perhaps the one exception but even then you generally have to really push for it or have rune/sigils/traits that bolster that. Burn guardian is probably your best bet for core condi class followed by core engi then core necro since core necro has a trait that at least boosts condi durations applied by scepter by 50%. 
---
Ranger by all rights is a weak class because of their reliance on the pet and the pet's AI and overall damage is generally weak. If you intend to play condi you will need an expansion for viper's gear access.
---
Cosmic Girl. (Jamiroquai)

no, using every single filter and effect you can find [still](https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cgscbz/dark_shattered_angel/) [doesn't](https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c3v72b/my_angel_is_ready_for_dragon_bash_and_the_return/) [create](https://dd.reddit.com/r/sololeveling/comments/bsn8jp/sharing_my_take_on_a_shadow_warrior_cosplay_in/) great images
---
LOL I know. My comment was completely tongue-in-chick....err...CHEEK!!
---
&gt; The only one stopping you from doing it is yourself.
---
Actually that would be the insular raiding community gatekeeping new players from participating.
---
How to find in game friends in GW2. Go to WvW, join the server voice chat, follow the group, wait till you figure out which of the major guilds on your server you want to join, ask to join. Simple as that. 
---
I made some friends on there years ago by ending up in WvW guild. I hardly play these days but still chat with them anytime im back on. WvW guilds are always active, always on voice chat. Its the only way to do it.
---
Lmao now this is some high quality bullshit.
---
Sure, blame a single group and not the company that's leaving much more than just raiders dissatisfied.
---
Ah, yes. The insular raiding community with their toxic training runs in lfg. You're right.
---
I'm pretty sure it's Melanie Martinez' cover of the song. She auditioned with it on The Voice!
---
A couple of reasons:
---
- Worser innate defenses. With WH and Arcane and a tiny bit of boon duration you can easily get perma protection (and perma fury). Weaver has evades but that only works well if you’re fighting a few enemies with telegraphed attacks. If you’re fighting a lot of enemies with damage all around Tempest has better sustain and longevity
---
- Worser cleave. Not having overload air means you cannot pull the same number of mobs and auto attack dagger &gt; sword for cleave and with scepter you can spam AoE burst skills to cleave
---
- Weaver has more DPS but Tempest has more upfront burst for the first 15 or so second. Most fights in open worlds don’t last that long if you run Zerk.
---
you must never check lfg then because I don't even check once a day and I still see them
---
They will never share it / tell you.
---
I think thats part of the joke
---
&gt;Meanwhile the human gods want to abandon Tyria because they think it’s too risky to stay, could destroy everything.
---
That one is also quite debatable.
---
Anet destroyed Guild Wars 2. They didn't need anyones help.
---
I'm sad because i have so many amazing memories from this game. And most of those good memories are from before thr first expansion. The game started going downhill in 2017 when thry stopped carring about casual players.
---
I mean your right and destined for the reddit gutter (When Anets fanatic fan base get to you). 
---
There is a large potion of newish players that are ok with Anets silence because they haven’t been around since launch... or even launch of GW1. Anet has ALWAYS hyped content... then underdelivered. The difference now (the reason I’m on the way out for good) is the are doing it piece wise and it kills motivation for veterans who are desperate for content and freshness. Looks no further than the exodus of LS1.  Which was the same shitshow. 
---
Xpacs have always been Anets strong suit, because it’s deficits get masked by other content in different aspects (pvp, dungeons... etc) that’s no longer the case.
---
what.
---
From male experience male humans are chosen either by gays or *extremely* bland people and female norns are taken buy futa lovers. 
---
Other than that there is no difference, racial skills are nearly worthless and racial storylines are different, but aren't important.  Create both, try different armor skins in the wardrobe, consider the paragraph above and chose what you like more.
---
Only difference is [cultural armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cultural_armor) and [Racial skills](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Racial_skill) which are mostly useless and used just for fun.
---
The start of the story is also different but they merge in the middle.
---
All classes are viable in all game modes except for WvW zerging. WvW is a massive PvP game mode where three servers fight in massive hundred-man battles.
---
I like here how you quote a former employee that was let go before a massive shake up and redirection of the company gives vague information of "2 dragons or something similar" as the facts to back up that those that disagree with you are blind.
---
A season is a year. They obviously have time to add in something new.
---
They had a major shake up and pulled people off other projects and moved them to GW2. They obviously have the labor to add in something new.
---
I'm not saying there will be new things coming in LS5. The announcement could well be LS5 is same as always and they are doing an expansion. Or we could all get nothing. But it seems rather short sighted to be making definitive statements.
---
And for aesthetics wich one had better look for you?
---
Large races like charr and norn can seem clunky and slow at time, I'd definitely recommend human.
---
You aren't silent part of the community. You are the oppressive part, every time someone voices a complaint over the game, a bunch of you guys come and start shitting: "GET OUT OF THE GAME".
---
This is so wrong for 99% of groups.
---
Can recommens this, very fun to play and really strong especially if youre hitting more than 1 mob!
---
Mispelled my name D:
---
Interesting progress, I like that.
---
I know that my money would be placed on betting "disappointed". And I am not saying we are going to get anything new.
---
But with the level of info we have right now it seems silly to take a firm stance either direction.
---
Norns are awesome to get that big armor look, just everything feels so slow and jumping puzzles can get messy. I love my asura warrior (electromagnetic armor to me still has the best look). There's something cool about yoda-dodging in mid fight and a lil tiny guy using hundred blades to chop up a massive boss. Have fun!
---
I love the Asura animations but.. the armours fit okay with Asura? I mean.. it's so tiny and you cant see details on the armour. Isn't it?
---
Lately? Lol.
---
“Lately” 😂
---
Don't play Living World Season 4. Aurene dies, revived, then kills Kralkatorrik.
---
I predict the will be a lot of people playing WoW classic that only remember their good memories and forgot how god awful WoW was in the beginning.
---
What did you think knights did, never get off their horse and fight?
---
repost
---
i have no idea who those people are but.. spoiler?
---
I am already expecting LS5 to be nothing special and nothing good, especially considering Anet has a track record of doing little good when they're not working on expansions.
---
You will see.
---
Well first, you reasoning and statement do not corelate. I said GW2 and FF14 handle cities differently and their art style is not the same.
---
Second, if you get offended by other players choice of character creation, you are not better than people who, for example, deny gays the right to marry because it offends them. Who the hell cares how someone builds their char? Live and let be. Also also, if you do not like gw2s art style, why play it? If you want a more grounded look play eso or ff14. Gw2 is known for it's colorfull, palletewashed style. Seriously man, it's not rocket science.
---
I like both gw2 and ff14 but they are just not comparable. They have different art, different combat, different progression, different classes and management. The only thing they really have in common is that they both are MMORPGs
---
Well... that's it... Uninstalling game right now.
---
Shit, I always miss leaks.
---
And yeah, that one sounds fake as shit. I mean, it's way too dumb, even for ArenaNet's worst.
---
Yes, and an ass one. Spoiler rule on this sub is one month free after the release of content, but that doesn't mean you're supposed to throw it out in the face of new players the moment they step in.
---

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.

If you want there's also our gvg tournament trailer  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ubyLiA3Yw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ubyLiA3Yw)
---
At first I thought you were just trolling but after reading your other comments I am convinced you are dead serious.
---
It is astonishing the vast majority of people who refer to raiders as toxic are people who don't even raid and are just afraid to step out of their auto attacking comfort zone. Grow up.
---
Huh now I’m kinda mad I never got one I opened too many to count lol
---
Why?
---
I never had one drop despite farming istan at least 4 hours a day the whole tome it was out and viable now I’m more upset than anything lol
---
&gt; If someone has to hate someone, it should be management who made what seem like some really stupid decisions. Management is who is enforcing this silence (despite being open to more communication post-layoffs) and who made the decision to only leave a skeleton crew working on Living World.
---
Ding ding ding.
---
yeah, you need to zoom in but the detail is great. However, if you want to have a race that feels like the weight of the weapon is important then asura will be the race for you.
---
With each animation like 2-handed they swing the weapon around like they barely can hold them.
---
"Dont play blahs blahs cuz things happen" 
---
You must be a genius...
---
don't like it?  go pay a monthly subscription for another mmo :)
---
A tournament to see who spends more money on the gem store?
---
They can't even do that right (see the Mystic Forge donations).
---
That sounds pretty smart by ArenaNet.
---
Guess we'll have to wait a few years until some developers decides to spend his personal time to implement it officially (not unlike the 1st person camera).
---
There was a second one refering to the first a few days later which was similiar downvoted, but the discussion behind it let's me think that it's not totally impossible. Especially the idea that GuildWars 2 needs to be re-invented for new players is something I can get behind. 
---
The updates and living story mechanics are really awesome, however new players start a game that is seven years old, even if they use their level 80 boosts and get their raptor shortly after the 'tutorial mission'.
---
The old content isn't bad, it just doesn't match the quality standards of today. This is why I was looking forward for something like the stuff in said post.
---
This!! I’m over people ignoring the track record and acting like their personal feelings are what’s to come.
---
More like roadkills, left in the wake of the gem store truck.
---
There is a dps golem in the aerodrome.
---
im sorry im not a raider and out of the loop, what is this for?
---
&gt; This is exactly the problem. Wow was a massive failure
---
Someone lives in a bubble.
---
Ah the typical toxic casual, because their gamemode is fine they deny all the games problems.
---
See how easy it is to label people and put words in their mouth?
---
Same then open them in SW with every buff and get stacks of rates and exotics
---
wasnt it weekly?
---
Are you trying to fit as many meme stereotypes as possible in a single comment? If so you could definitely be doing better.
---
Sylvari
---
*Screams of horror*
---
Even if you dont care about perfect benchmark rotations everything u are looking for u can do with the golem, sure it wont tell u the dps, you will have to hit it for a bit.
---
I like the way your DH looks. Is the celestial infusion the only infusion you have on it, to achieve that reddish looking color?
---
I like it
---
Yeah, the reason why I was asking for a site was because that would allow me to avoid having to buy the gear and all that jazz.
---
GW2 raiders aren't gay, everyone else is gay towards them and call them toxic when they reply in turn.
---
That "smart" was sarcastic, but yeah. They could make an exception for the event, but hey, let's just act like an ass instead!
---
a Raid tournament
---
Gear is very simple. Just hit crit cap with assassin pieces, then take berserker for everything else. Go scholar runes and you're done
---
This is what is wrong the toxic raiders mentality is that  they think they are the only ones doing the raids.
---
No.
---
Everyone has done it got the achievements maybe repeated a bit to get everything because of legendary armour and called it.
---
There is no need to get out of the comfort zone because it is still casual content.
---
Sylvari, always Sylvari.
---
make legendary armor and weps, that way you have all the stats
---
Tbh the best burn build burst dmg guard I saw uses Celestial armor which is the ultimate mix. Could probably do without the healing power since guardian has plenty of aegis, but the burn damage is significant.
---
Again though, run into enemies with burn resistance and you're kind of out of luck with average damage.
---
Also, I'm assuming u mean focus, not warhorn.
---
If you are only doing open world then your DPS doesn't matter at all, just run whatever you want and press whatever buttons you want
---
Do you have heart of thorns? If so, just use the stat selectable exotic set. Dont use condi weapons with power gear though
---
I am so glad I saw this as I never knew it made any difference, thanks!
---
Okay, delusion it is. No need to bother arguing further.
---
It's basically an in-joke, the way that you never see horses pop up in Monty Python and they use coconuts for the sound instead. They're there, they're just never on camera (except in special circumstances).
---
Which stat selectable set?
---
You are generalizing way too often. 
---
&gt; Because after doing everything in a raid, armour achievements the game mode itself is boring and you just playing it for the rewards, **at least me**
---
Exacly, to you. So do not say the game mode is boring.
---
&gt; They claim raids should be exclusive to the best players and only best players can do them.
---
I raid for over 2 years almost daily and I never ever heard anyone say that raids should be exclusive content. 
---
&gt; Karka World Boss. And this is without people being carried
---
Debatable. You get carried if you longbow pew pew from max range in some strange gear mix and do 500dps while others go full in and press their buttons. You got the kill by doing *some* damage. Just because no one sees you and no one cares doesn't mean you didn't get carried.
---
Setting a precedent for allowing the breaking of the ToS would be pretty disastrous for a company.  Especially in case of an explicitly banned tool that was being used to get a pretty large advantage in the competitive modes.
---
Wow I didn’t know it was that inconvenient for f2p players...
---
I mean, I'd be overjoyed if the future holds reworks to the underlying trait / item stats / item systems, a re-imagining of some classes from the ground up to remove a lot of semi-unused cruft and also a rework of some older zones that have gone under.
---
Sure.
---
But I'll be damned if I think I'll get this in GW2, it'd need to be a GW3 to implement those. Nevermind even bigger things such as proper WvW.
---
Well, I am indeed playing another game. I only play gw2 for my weekly raid static.  But it isn't an mmo, I'm just cleaning out the steam backlog.  So I half took your advice.  But I don't think it help Anet when their own customers tell other customers not to play their game...
---
Oh, i see. Thank you.

This is true, which is why I said I disagree to an extent. That extent is largely that I see the bigger fuck-up being whatever the studio did that was stealing talent from Guild Wars. Think about it. At some point, they were so confident in another project that they were going to make S4 the last season of Guild Wars 2. Possibly the END of Guild Wars 2. But somehow that project still managed to fail? How are you so confident in a product like that and still have it fall apart? I don't have experience in the game industry, but that seems like an outlier in how games are made. If your secondary product has reached a place where you're pulling talent from your primary product to work on it, that speaks to a certain confidence that the secondary product is going to get off the ground. The fact that is didn't speaks to a major structural issue in the company in those days and those days were when MO had an active role as game director. Also the whole idea that the devs were being told to make GW2 "look" like it was being developed by a full staff, i.e. lying to the community, and have that all be for nothing is not a \*great\* look for a company. So perhaps I'm more willing to give Z some number of years to rebuild after something as catastrophic as that. As harmful as it would likely be to the game, I'm kind of curious about what the hell actually went on. Because it seems like a whole lot more than "we were making too many game ideas". But we're not going to know because NDAs exist. We could be completely ignorant of something. I just see Z as still potentially cleaning up a mess. I think the announcement on the 30th will dictate a lot of that going forward.
---
and yet so much worse than it could have been
---
Nope, you imagining:-P
---
It was fixed last week. Players should no longer be able to remove sigils from unbound legendaries.
---
k
---
To the point. I can dig it.
---
It's not a separate server option, but not a separate game, either. It's a separate launcher, like how you'd select the Public Test Realms.  
---
  
---
Still, it's true that they aren't publicizing it *at all*. It's a game made to capitalize on nostalgia, but the subscription for Classic is the same as the subscription for retail WoW, so you really don't lose anything if you're already subscribed or want to try out one or the other.
---
Or the Daedalus.
---
So I guess, overall condi is really debatable.
---
Ye, focus, not warhorn, my bad ^^
---
I'd like to be more tanky, can I avoid crit chance, investing in Soldier eq? Power, toughness, vitality with this weapon setup?
---
Server option in the  sense of the "region" dropdown in the Blauncher, similar to how you would pick PTR or region for other games. Of course it still has multiple realms!
---
PMed you my ign, more friends wouldn't be so bad xD
---
Exactly, I and several of my friends love the fact we only need a few slots in an invisible bag to store most of our loot instead of needing to stop every few minutes to clear out inventory.
---
To put it into perspective further, the top reason people want Classic is because, compared to modern WoW, they're completely different games. Like, picture GW2 being modern WoW and GW1 being Classic WoW, sort of the same feeling.
---
I didnt get the joke then and still dont get it now '.'
---
If you can learn to tank minstrels is a great stat for raids, and most pugs for fractals are fine with a healbrand.
---
As for what to build next, I highly recommend Druid due to being massively desired.
---
&gt; (which was how it worked before the beta)
---
This should tell you what you need to hear. If it was in there before the beta it was dropped for a reason. It was probably dropped because it interfered to much with with the "no holy trinity" thing they sold the game on. Beyond that it would the game would be much closer to passive defense being more important than active defense, for that reason if nothing else I prefer the system they went with vs needing a arbitrary amount of defensive stats before you can dodge.
---
Good for you.
---
I like to play MMORPGs.  Story RPGs are not for me.
---
You are very good, keep it up ⭐️
---
I'm not generalising and it does not have to do with my experience in raids because I found them easy. It has to do with the negativity raid content produces towards all other comminities and how elitists from raids treat all other communities as casuals despite them being the casualiest of all.
---
I do get your points though, and when I raided I had your mindset kind of, except I didn't care much of others and was more about self improvement. I believe everyone does that to some extent it's part of being a raider. My issues is not with the raids itselfs but the community that comes from them, specific the raiders only community. What I don't like from the community is that their massive egos is trying to kill the game. The rest of the game is very good and enjoyable, sure they are problems and could be better. But in the end this all comes to greed and wanting too much without caring about other people at all. You can see what I mean on this Reddit overall and on teapot stream. When he is gone you will see things getting better in Guild Wars 2. But again this is my opinion and I can be wrong, and I wish I was.
---
Is this refering to the hidden lantern puzzle and spectre in Labyrinthine Cliffs?
---
I love the depth of the underwater areas of that map. It really is a shame that most people don't appreciate underwater content
---
The gods have abandoned Tyria but we do just fine with the God of Cartography (Tekkit) and the Goddess of Guidance (Dulfy). Thank you so much!!!
---
Unfortunately almost all the builds are requiring berserker eq. And for some reason I'm not a fan of ferocity, I'd rather have more survivability. Still can try out Captain or Barbarian builds...
---
God speed and if there's anything I can do to help map it let me know
---
Thanks a lot :3 I really appreciate it &lt;3
---
oh no. u can go, u can stay, i actually do not care. it's not me screaming "oh no boh boh a famous (who?) player is leaving. the end is night!!!" i'm not the one who keep on saying "you should be raiding, you should be play this way and have this equp"
---
i was just saying this whole fear for streamer who only a minority of the community watch is pointless. 
---
this is not a nolifer mmo. u can play most of the game rolling your face on the keyboard and just having fun.
---
u can complain on the game as much as you want but since you are a minority if anet should listen to your idea most of the playerbase could not appreciate.
---
we do not know anything about real game statistic.
---
I can also attest that druid is a ton of fun in group play if you love support classes.

---
Looking at the message it looks like it is running into an issue while trying to decode some textures
---
Khmm, that's a lot of airship parts, but I think I could make it for a few of my characters. :)
---
Thanks!
---
It's ok, but people can stop down voting.
---
Definitely! You can also go for one stat combo for armor and another for jewelry/trinkets. Maybe you go zerk armor, but rabid trinkets or something like that. I wouldnt worry much about runes and sigils until you find something you like
---
Of course!
---
Thanks :3
---
Then I must have been dreaming when I started raiding by joining and opening training runs. Hmm.

---
&gt; I like to play MMORPGs.
---
I can tell! You post constantly if not exclusively on rGuildWars2.
---
Will you eat your hat on stream if you're totally wrong? Or dunno, a shoe perhaps. I'm asking a real question here.
---
Just do the hearts and buy the currencies if you would like to get them quicker. Most people complain about the diflourite, but you dont have to kill anything to do the hearts, so I got a portal to sandswept isle and did it on all my alts and got it done in an hour and a half.
---
Seems like it. It's the first thing I did this year, but same as previous festivals, there is no achievement whatsoever :(
---
I think the Goddess of Guidance might have left with the other six.
---
Please don’t tank on full minstrel’s except for bosses like Dhuum or SH. There’s no need on 90% of the bosses. I tank on full harriers and the quickness minor trait for FB gives +250 toughness. That’s more than enough to be effective as a tank in most bosses and you’re not completely useless in the damage category
---
I bought the full game! So I should be good to go. Thank you :)
---
chair looks pretty good imo.
---
just happy I can get another armor and 2 more weapon skins.
---
This is some good stuff, thank you so much!
---
Can't wait to use my Victory Rock in WvW!
---
Not the first one doom prophet here.
---
As we already know, when Anet says we are getting something cool, then we are.
---
Not so long ago, people were raging against skyscale that it will make other mounts obsolete etc. But they once again made it perfect.
---
We are talking on things they planned long time ago, year or more. 
---
Dev is excited, I trust them. As always.
---
End boss at entrance. 1 HP. Drops a stack of Confetti Infusions.
---
Feliz de poder contribuir! :)
---
Awesome! I’m actually already working on that, thanks a ton!! I just went through and bought all the insignias just to have them all :/
---
And if everyone being lazy like that makes the meta events look much harder than they really are, just moan until Anet gets to nerf their difficulty like Chak Gerent or Zealots.
---
No level 70 scroll? Rip meme.
---
As suspected, a chair novelty item as exclusive new thing this year, I am cool with that :) Though, knowing what you will get as birthday present in advance is kinda lame anet... :P
---
No rewards. Just for fun.
---
Not everyone have time or want to watch video and study a guide to play.or to farm equip.
---
Different approach to the game. Your choice.
---
gw2power.com has not been updated in a while, but the basics still work.
---
how bout no
---
they usually dont reveal it. especially not shaman
---
Looks like I have new background wallpaper to use. Thanks!
---
An unfortunate truth that I don’t think will be otherwise :(
---
Lets hope... I need them ... desperately :D

YES!
---
Was there any word in the livestream about sales for the expansion packs? I've been holding out buying PoF since we're coming up on the anniversary, but didn't see any word of it in the cliff notes.
---
Black Lion Instant Level 80 Ticket is 2000 gems in the gemstore, Arenanet wouldn't give that away to a simple loyal customer of 8 years.
---
U can do 10 Min fractal and stop. U can start with easy fractal tier one and only if u wnat move to upper tiers.
---
Can u see the difference?
---
I'm not a native speaker but I can tell you used it correctly lol
---
Oh, my bad. Thanks for the correction.
---
Thanks for your help :)
---
I've missed 5 bosses today, it's a bit disheartening tbh, I'm not sure if it's even worth it at this point and I don't know how to further improve it :/
---
Thanks for that summary! I noticed a couple of these things but was wondering how worth it they were (like the water traits rework).
---
So I realize Weaver is pretty strong right now, but that’s based on their DPS rotations. 
---
For solo’ing content though, it seems to me Tempest is still better as it allows you to get a lot of passive defense while still gearing full glass.
---
Is that a fair assumption?
---
&gt; Unfortunately almost all the builds are requiring berserker eq. And for some reason I'm not a fan of ferocity, I'd rather have more survivability.
---
It will cost you some gold but you should experiment if for no other reason than to test your bias and put numbers to your thoughts and ideas. Alot of players will tell you to go 100% offensive stats and skills, follow snowcrows builds 100%!!! or something like that. They are right ofc those builds are the best at dealing raw dmg (when not under threat) but when you are out in the open world or just a new player to the game having defensive options is not a bad idea. You dont have to make all your armor/trinket/weapon stats 100% the same, you could pick all berserkers trinkets/weapons with soldiers armor (just a example) to get that extra survivability you want in the beginning. Other than stats the best kind of defense in GW2 is the active kind, so learning mobs tells and just walking out of the dmg (not ever attack needs to be dodged) and depending on your class you have access to other options that can allow you to shrug off more dmg than just stats would allow you to and give you windows to get your big dmg skill out that lock you into a cast animation.
---
Lesser people than u think watch video of others playing to learn about how to play on gw2 and in other games.
---
Most players just play.
---
I will have to disagree... with the recent seasons, dragons have shown personality, and it has been very interesting to me. 
---
e.g. “Mother...”? What could that possibly mean? Is there an entity behind the dragons?
---
Meanwhile, Balthazar and Scarlett, to me, felt too generic—like a side story.... but maybe that’s just me :p
---
You are a life saver &lt;3
---
Go play those games then if you want that GW2 and 1 for that matter have always been buy to play games free of any sub fees lifetime or not.
---
Awesome thanks! Are these optimized for mounts?
---
&gt; Not so long ago, people were raging against skyscale that it will make other mounts obsolete etc. But they once again made it perfect.
---
I'm sorry, but... well... okay I guess fair enough, there's always overly convicted fans. Everything has them, not just an individual video game.
---
But really, even with something as ultimately inconsequential as the Skyscale, there's lots they could improve. Is it a clear upgrade in mount quality over the shoddy Roller Beetle which is amazing but in an engine not meant for a racing game? Sure! Does it feel like a mount of the same quality as the core mounts? Nope.
---
Doesn't mean it's bad. At all.
---
Doesn't mean I'm trying to be a "doom prophet" or anything, either. As the threat poster did, just keep your expectations in check. "Living story that evolves around you" ultimately got cut off, too. WvW got taken out of the living world entirely. Rebalancing orbs came down to just removing them, incentives for PvE players to care about WvW state were removed, the tons of new zones are all undercooked short-term bandaids. Nothing about this is truly bad, even if I'm intentionally overstating it right now for dramatic effect. But if there's one clear line in all of GW2's post-release development, it's "keep your expectations low". And you get big positive surprises, like HoT.
---
She is probably taking a break to deal with personal stuff, have faith.
---
"And once again... we'd like to give a big middle finger to all of you who are just as loyal to the game over time yet didn't keep the same exact character forever! That is all."
---
Brings money to the game with ANet having to do very little work. It's why Cryptic still sells the lifetime and it still sells. The lifetime sto sub also gives you $5/month in store credit which is something ANet could do as well.
---
Of course the biggest problem is that STO has had that since launch and Cryptic has never had anything like that and wouldn't really be as far. Even now with STO we struggle to encourage new players to buy it because the game has been out for so long.
---
In game its the best community without a shadow of the doubt it seems the reddit and forum community has decided bitching is the only thing they can do.
---
Do those even matter when, if you've played that long, you likely have a lot of tomes?
---
Nothing to do with what I said. I do play STO and I have the LTS for that which I bought back in 2012. I wouldn't be a mod on this sub if I didn't love GW2 and enjoy playing it and still do putting in at least 10 hours a week if not more. I love that it's buy to play with no fee, that's why I got into it in the first place, just got into it a couple years later than I wish I did. 
---
I'm not saying GW2 should have a sub fee of any kind, read what I said, but there are new players who started from HoT to now will have to wait years to get these things. If ANet had an optional purchase that unlocked them for a large fee, that's free money to ANet to fund the game and those who don't want to wait can buy them. It's convenience. It's an easy way to bring in money from new players who don't want to wait for those things.
---
Man if that's the case I know I'm not staying around... Please give us something new or at least different Mike Z.
---

---
Yep that is his origins :D
---
- Son, get down from your chair!!!
---
- But ArenaNet taught me this.
---
The account reward requires a character of said age to unlock.
---
They haven't yet, I'm also hoping for S2 to go on sale.
---
Living World season 4 was on sale in April I think.
---
This is all I was looking forward to. I wanna grab both the expansions, but not at full price. Playing the waiting game.
---
\**crush** report
---
JFC, they’ve been handing **character specific gifts since 2006**.
---
I get it, you’re bitter, but it has nothing to do with a studio giving middle fingers to anyone. You’re not entitled to these gifts.
---
Who cares about tomes? :D
---
Birthday boosters is the fun part. You can never have enough of these.
---
I’ve put dps’d pugs on the meter running harrier’s when they’re on a dps build multiple times. It’s not useless. You’re talking a 5-6k/s difference in minstrel’s vs. harrier’s. 
---
You should always run as little toughness/vit as you can to be effective. Of course if you don’t trust yourself to dodge damage or mechanics then you have to go minstrel’s to survive
---
Victory Rock or Warclaw while AFK in spawn though?
---
Remember that there's two points in the run where you're meant to waypoint/shrine travel.  After the first boss, people waypoint to the northwest and Skyscale/Springer/run around behind and Jackal Portal up to the Hydra.  After the fifth boss, the third in the Underworld, you use shrine travel to the southeast/Melandru shrine, where you Skyscale up to the Branded Hydra, or Beetle through the wall below and to the northeast under the Hydra boss, and then use the Jackal portal on the other side.
---
The Griffon travel is more bothersome to someone without a Griffon, if you can't keep up on a Raptor, then you might just need to do something else until you get your Griffon, or at least your Skyscale.
---
I just checked. I can buy the tyrian exchange voucher again, so it should have reset for you too. I am EU btw.
---
Enjoy:-)
---
I'm tempted to get them.. 50% off... but I want to get more chars slots more I think. I still need 3 to have each prof.
---
Can't believe it's been SEVEN years already...
---
look on the bright side: this means you're not a basic bitch
---
yeah mounts are account-wide
---
Can you craft?
---
Maybe go with PvP instead?
---
I seriously thought this thread would be about crushes on gw2 characters, got dissapointed ;&lt;
---
Thx, the guy below had an interestic combination of accessories, what do you think about it?
---
&gt; I'm marauder all except valk trinkets and zerker rings. Damage is good. And hp is around 18.3k ur still squish so watch ur positioning.
---
Any account with 8 year old characters probably has enough tomes/scrolls that they never have to worry about leveling up a character again, so they aren't buying the Instant 80 anyways.  It would be a gesture of goodwill by ArenaNet without actually affecting them monetarily.
---
&gt; The fact that we have to spend so much time identifying gear. Wasn't the point of this to make inventory management less annoying? All they did was change it so we could do inventory management in bigger bursts. Your still spending tons of times just opening your rewards rather than playing the game.
---
Well, if IDing takes too much time for you, you have now the choice to sell your stack of 250 gear items within 1 transaction instead of maybe 100 or so different ones when you ID them first (or got 250 random gear drops in the prior system without Unids).
---
Haha I would actually have played it if I didn't get back to GW2. But now I'm glad to have something NEW to invest myself on !
---
they changed it a while ago now that Magic Find doesnt influence the identifying process anymore....
---
Hoarder's Syndrome.  I don't have all of the dyes, but I'm not using any of the remaining ones on my current wardrobe.  And I might need one some day!
---
Admittedly, anniversary dyes are far from the only source of the underlying problem...
---
Generally you need to level the appropriate crafting disciple to 500.
---
Once done you can buy ascended recipes and craft.   There are time gates on some materials and you will need to complete high end content for other components.
---
Recommend you start with weapons as they give most bang for buck, after ascended trinkets/rings which you will usually need the paid game for.
---
gw2efficiency has a crafting section that you can input what you want.
---
(Some options may be limited on free accounts - it's designed to give you a feel for the game, i.e. more like shareware than F2P)
---
It's the GW2 anniversary.  A huge load of people got GW2 when it was released. So the anniversary is linked to the birthday. A birthday is an anniversary. They even say so in their own announcement. Well roared, lion cub.
---
First off, this is an MMO stop soloing group content unless you want some extreme challenge or are bored.
---
Second, since you are F2P the only content you can do and be anything close to decent at is Fractals and Open World.  Raids require an expansion and no core spec is very good in group play in WvW.   If you want to solo roam then OK but still core specs aren't very good.
---
If you are an open world only player then don't bother with ascended, you can complete all open world content in rare gear or even naked since it is so braindead easy.  If you are doing fractals then as you work your way up in fractal level you'll have higher chances at ascended weapon/armor drops.  Outside of that your only option is to craft it or get extremely extremely lucky getting a drop in open world.
---
Dungeons only have exotic gear so those are useless for getting ascended items.  If you can speed clear them with a good group they are a decent source of income though.
---
But they didnt collect data on the ID loot table they researched the differences in their salvaging results and thats less than 20 different mats
---
Chairs don't work on WvW
---
Ahh, August 25, the day I can lord all of all you with my fancy, “pre-order only for three days” title.
---
You are not supposed to do fractals solo. Use the lfg to find groups for lower level fractals do the t1 dailies and get the rings first. It will take some time to get the rest as p4f player since you cannot buy the recipes to craft them directly (you can get some with laurels from achievements) so you have to use marks to buy them. Level up the crafting disciplines you need and do daily recommend fractals (as high as you can) weekly wvw chests until 4th tier and ranked pvp till the first time of the last chest (when the season is active) and research the grandmaster marks.
---
The seventh year anniversary title will be 'Steadfast' (see: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero_(achievements)#achievement1687).
---
While we're at f2p ascended.. has anybody used toxic wurm armor piece stat selection recently? Is the wiki up-to-date saying it has only 4 prefixes or has AN expanded the list?
---
U do realize its just simple rock ?
---
Those downstates are mostly due to people getting smacked by Sam. That is a boss where unless fixated you really have no business taking damage. But whatever.
---
My ultimate point is on any class you should really only have as much tankiness as needed to survive and the rest can be poured into other stats. Plus if you full minstrel on FB you will always tank and chrono is still a better tank in most cases.
---
A whole set of new features is certainly a "big update" if you're a dev.

If you play rogue for the gadgets/tricks Engineer, if you play for the thief/assassin role play, thief. If you play to be a suave mother fucker, mesmer. If you play rogues because you absolutely hate mages, and wish every single one of the arrogant bastards would die, get resurrected, and then die more painfully, maybe warrior into spell breaker would be cool (two daggers lots of interrupts, lots of crow control, and it is still possible to make him look thiefy through outfits and certain cosmetics, but would require a maxxed out character and 250 skill points, so maybe make this a long term goal if that is your thing).  
---
Mechanically, thief will be closest. This whole game revolves around cooldown management, except for thief which is a resource dump/burst window kinda class. Engineer can feel like a rogue with unlimited energy, but you use explosives instead of daggers, and also RIP your keyboard, enjoy your carpal tunnel. They also both use the same armor/trinkets, and when you get the best gear you can actually use one set for both of them, and trade it when you want to swap off. So maybe one of these two is your best bet?

Quick guide, (sauce: experience)
---
1) Get full exotic - build appropriate obv. (dungeons is a nice start); 2) Do fotm 20 if possible (/lfg) - get exotic ring that holds infusions; 3) Do all the other T1 dailies inc. recommended each day (take your time); 4) Level Crafting - build and class appropriate (ask a paid player for assistance if possible); 5) Join a guild, do guild missions, get ascended accessories; 6) Your fractals are going well, get ascended rings - move up a tier; 7) With limited laurels you got from 1000AP buy ascended recipe for armor or a weapon, craft it; 8) Your fractal recommended runs are doing well, buy more ascended item(s); 9) Your daily rewards will fill the rest. GL with those.
---
When that level 90 booster comes out a year after, the whole game changes.
---
I think the boosters are good incentives for inactive players to get back in the game. Providing a lvl 80 booster would invalidate the gemstore booster they sell, so it was pretty unlikely they would go there.
---
Just gonna leave this here (its from another commenter) ......   https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero_(achievements)#achievement1687
---
HAhah for reals
---
But the dev did offer support...
---
And this reddit community is how you completely miss the point.  Then again OP is famous for being a complete and utter moron in addition to being a toxic casual
---
Will I believe the person that organized the event and was in direct talks with ANET or will I believe you, a person that threw tantrums over not being able to karma farm without any limits?
---
Uhmmmmm, what a tough choice.
---
Yes but you'll get something new every year.
---
*OCD triggered*

🦀 spaghetti code 🦀

This person isn't representative of anything, don't worry about it.
---
The scrapped projects were all mobile games, so unless GW3 was gonna be mobile I doubt it.
---
Correct, don't do that.
---
He didn't get denied support, He denied support due to the conditions .
---
Yea your right I messed up there, I get all my dyes from the TP so I often forget alot of those are bought with gems or statuettes. I think they point still stands tho since mount skins are not trabeable on the TP and we dont have a birthday glider skin either.

---
I get that you can technically do that for most content and have little to no trouble, but it's not exactly good advice. As Js_T said, it sucks to go to coordinated meta events and watch them fail when people roll up in full soldier's gear because it's what they got given by the level 80 booster and they never bothered changing it.
---
Ahem OSRS, WoW, FFXIV, ESO to name a few all regularly have thousands more viewers than GW2
---
At 10 years do you think they will give us a Legendary Weapon Choice box?
---
If you haven't created one in 10 years of playing, I think it's fair if you receive one. Especially considering we got blue balled with receiving Caladbolg, which in the lore was a 'Legendary' greatsword but when we received it and it's incarnations it was just an Ascended.
---
Yes. Once again. From thr very first bday presents in GW1. Come on man, they aren't going to change this, and apparently youve been mad about it for over a decade, what's the point?
---
i tend to watch what i'm working on at the moment in game. a while ago i was watching a lot of pvp streamers, now i'm trying to get better at fractals so i watch people who do t4 dailies and cm. but i also watch chatty streamers and do other stuff while i listen to them talk in the background.
---
Crush report*
---
Noted.  Thanks.
---
You guys should get together with drinks and pizza and watch the tournament live on stream
---
Yeah theres some areas that kinda show their age but it mostly still looks pretty decent. The character models themselves could probably use an update
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxmkAoLC6_4
---
still irrelevant. having 5-6k viewers at peak mainly formed of what, 10 streamers with a few hundreds?
---
That's a big lie because the other 2 were supported (expecially the first one) and you're making yourself look like an idiot.
---
It's not missing the point necessarily, it's twisting and misrepresenting the point so it fits their own views.
---
The Home Instance Node Pack -- does anyone think this is worth it for the 35% off price of 2600 gems?  I really enjoy using other peoples home instances but it feels like these nodes are... less valuable overall.  Does the inclusion of all these nodes every justify the cost or will the servers shut down long before then?
---
Man if they do player housing, that'd be so many wasted resources.  I see guild halls and it just makes me sad.  I think their version of player housing is just our home instances though.  What more could anyone really want from that?  Decorations at a cheaper cost than guild ones?  Ehhh so you can sit in a room by yourself in an instance?  The RP crowd is way too small for that but then again, they made chairs people can sit in so I guess its possible.
---
I could see elite specs and/or build templates along with episode 1 and for it to launch in September though.  That would make sense for Anet.
---
Can you go away and leave this thread alone? We're having fun here, we don't need you to bitch around and be toxic.
---
It's not about raids being mentioned, it's the flat out lies in the post that are making people correct it.
---
The more I think about it, this would've been the perfect chance to give 7 years a themed mount pack - the first one they've given for free. Luminous mount skin pack, themed like the weapons.
---
i loled
---
Anyone know if the game itself goes on sale?
---
you can pvp or wvw for the dragonfall chest if you can’t be bothered to finish the achievements
---
I mean it's not really peak time since EU are sleeping, It's quite a steady 5-6k veiwers.
---
OSRS hits 100k with their DMM tournys.
---
The real issue is there is nothing to watch on GW2 streams, WoW and FFXIV have people progging raids. All our streamers cleared content ages ago and clear it on a daily basis with little to no issue. 
---
OSRS has actual punishing mechanics, so huge draw there. PvP especially is very risky so that's fun to watch and people like to tune in for hype moments when big things drop.
---
GW2 has none of that, We have infusions that are ridiculously expensive but not farmable with a really low drop rate. Daily pinata kill, which is like 90% particle effects and no challenge isn't going to bring in as much viewership as someone soloing a raid on OSRS.
---
They have a lot of personalitys, we have virtually none. The ones we do have are mostly complaining about state of the game and whilst I do agree with most of what they say, it's not entertaining to watch after a while.
---
Yes.
---
Noob question, where can you check your character's birthday?
---
Omg, nice! Ty
---
why not?
---
Thank you, I was also wondering what that meant.
---
You want to be the top in ARCDPS? put gear that will give you at least 65-70% crit chance. Would go Assassin and valk combination. 
---
You want to be able to survive one full rapid fire? go mara
---
I'd wager on August 30th, while people are excited for announcements. Seems like the best time to take advantage of those folks.
---
It's possible it's in development, Anet have said multiple times revenue slows down as is expected with old games. 
---
They've also stated they always have something going on in the background because as a buisness they have to in order to survive.
---
The only issue is how could it be different enough to justify it, A relaunch of gw2 branded as gw3 won't go down well, so it would need pretty hefty changes.
---
If Anet wanted to go sub-route they would have to make gw3, they can't slap a sub on GW2 7 years in.
---
I think dekeyz had a spreadsheet at one point that had all the timing including after cast and such.  &lt;shrug&gt;  yah, seemed like a huge load of work.
---
I still regret to this day that I deleted my Sylvari Elementalist. I miss you man :(
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama or violating the CoC is not allowed.

Thank you so much, I really appreciate you remembering me! My play group will love this! :D

Type this in the ingame chat.
---
OP actually died, He was only alive for 35% of the fight.
---
I would say wait until at least August 30th when they do their announcement. They might put older content on sale in prep for season 5.
---
It's been confirmed that all your characters can be recovered, but their age will reset to the date they are recovered.
---
The 7 year title is "Steadfast", was datamined ages ago: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Title
---
Last year they started the sales off with living world now my hope is they will end this year's sale with them as I already bought the gems for my alt account
---
in this scenario - i am in the U.S.A.
---
as i understand, all americans have one on hand at all times
---
You'd need to be hitting the nodes daily for years to break even,personally haven't done the math
---
Okay buddy.
---
Why stop here? Why don’t they sell every skin in the game store? PvE, PvP and WvW legendary armor would sell very well.
---
What a nice person you must be. You can't make me leave from a game I enjoy. Just because you have fun ruining others fun does not mean I won't do anything to stop that.

I enjoy this game a lot ;) playing everyday with friends thank you.
---
I’m a decently big gw2 streamer on NA. It’s mostly all about the community. I have been very fortunate in this game, and I like to give back in the form of giveaways and raid trainings. I love this game, and if people are inspired or positively impacted at all by my stream, I consider it a win. 
---
I’m not a full time streamer and this isn’t my main hustle (I work 45hrs a week) but since I’d be playing the game anyway, I may as well stream it :)
---
i cant tell if hes trolling or not
---
And then there's me, looking forward to the event for the corresponding GW1 event ahah
---
Vitality from Marauder set helps a lot when learning to deal with retaliation or where and how use your active escape tools when pressured. It's just small cushion tho, because if you get caught out of position no amount of additional HP will help you. Sooner or later you will want to transition to more aggressive build with Berserker or Assassin pieces.
---
This is literally the first time in a long time that Bik has been 100% real for the entirety of a video
---
Literally the worst of us.
---
Hmmm...while I am excited for the story, we need some sort of content to keep gw2 alfloat. I will patiently wait for the ls5 announcement
---
Hey guess what!
---
I play guild wars 2 because its a video game.
---
And i enjoy it, who cares about the drama.
---
I'm always reminded of Sam Sykes' ["Stages of Toxic Fandom"](https://twitter.com/samsykesswears/status/870337061210923008?lang=en) post when thinking about this.

There's a lot of people at stages five and six around here.
---

---
I agree that the system is kinda stupid, like why give the option to direct salvage if opening them is much better. And he even talks a bit about it in the comments under his posts. But yeah, theres a 15% tp fee regardless

---
Just use them for the most expensive dye you've not unlocked. Wiki the packs and it'll list the dyes and their price on tp, and you can even apply an api key to gray out those you unlocked.
---
No need to save inventory space on the dyes.
---
This is a lot of effort for something that's not particularly funny. Good job on the editing I guess
---
the same tp fees apply when you sell your salvaged mats on the tp so i dont see why they should deserve a special mention.
---
Zack Snyder would be proud
---
I did he made a comment about the community being toxic... which i could care less about. He went back to it because he loves drama... which i could care less about. He mentioned that he dislikes another streamer... which i don’t care about streamers, seriously if i spend time sitting my ass looking at people play a video game there is something wrong with me.
---
(I could be doing what that person is doing instead) but since i lost interest with the first few things i saw. I stopped watching it.
---
Long story short, i dont care. 😬
---
the rendering took longer than the editing
---
Wtf is this because im not clicking it lol

Total War - liked a lot of these games from Rome Total War 1/ Medieval 2 to WH ones, but well AI is always bad. You just find one cheese exploit after another. Multiplayer is only tactical battles, witch is fun for a day or two...

Total War Arena was a great concept (played during original beta? alpha?) then project was closed.

posting a screenshot or copy/paste of the text of the suspension would be helpful

I use Aegis. It’s not my fault if someone dies to getting hit by a damn tequatl style wave that any half blind monkey can see or if someone dies to standing in front of the boss when they aren’t fixated. This is the issue with a lot of players, they think it’s the healers job to heal everything. No. It’s everyone’s job to not get hit by obvious attacks and Sam has some of the most ridiculously obvious attacks in the game
---
When WoW 2 comes
---
If you have an account on [GW Efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com) it shows you the date created. Alternatively, ingame you can use the /age command which tells you how many days ago your character was created.
---
I was stuck on staff ele for very long, only recently found love for sc/wh ele its a whole new world.
---
If you want something else, try power soulbeast, all the cool weapon skills there will make your mind blown
---
At 50% off they will be 1200 gems, that is 433g. It is limited to one per account so the others would be 2400 gems or 867g. I've been playing since 2012, on and off admittedly, but when I played I was doing dailies almost very day and selling all resources. The most I got in all that time was a little bit above 300g and it lasted for about one day. Could you please tell me your tricks, unless it's by playing for hours every single day because then I understand.
---
Sylvari have the best flow of the personal story, with humans in second. Everything from level 1 to Heart of Thorns plays really sell into the Sylvari story
---
That's the real reason. Anet and their shiny new ideas and lack of commitment. They axed the second biggest game on the MMO market that already had its own e-sport scene, about 2 years before e-sport's popularity exploded and WoW's decline started.
---
All they had to do was keep going but no, they had to be more ambitious than that..
---
There was joko, but then he got turned into a meme and instantly deleted.
---
So I'm actually the owner of character name "Lucina Ylisstol" so one of these days I should finish that cosplay xD
---
You mean telling me that me not liking 3fps aura light show at world bosses is homophobic? A lot of people would rather have a more stable FPS over 3/4 white flashing screen.
---
Get out of here! Your analogy sounds like it came directly out of a 14 year olds ass. I don’t think I mentioned anything regarding gameplay, classe management or progression... honestly your need to defend a such a non productive way just shows how much of an idiot you are. 
---
The auras are obnoxious and get in the way of good gameplay that was my comment. Instead your reading comprehension led you to hur dur FFXIV is better.
---
He swallows eh? Got his number for uh.... science? ;)
---
Oh dear, another 5000 karma for still sticking around after 7 years. That's like... almost half a raid boss.
---
On one hand, its Bik and he is a piece of shit but on the other hand, he's not wrong on most of his Gw2 takes even if he does a extremely shit job at explaining them at times.
---
I think y´all need to take a step away from raiding and get laid every once in a while.

Pay for it, if you have to.

You're playing a Healbrand on Samarog. You're absolutely expected to aegis every slam. That's the entire point of bringing a healbrand to Samarog, you're not just a heal/quickness bot. Aegis allows the dps to run their rotations without interruptions to dodge, resulting in higher squad dps and faster phases. 
---
You can say "but they should just dodge!" but I'd then ask you: what are you even doing then, if you aren't utilizing your primary niche? That would bringing a Scourge to no-green VG and refusing to barrier, or bringing a Druid to Gorseval and refusing to use Entangle, or bringing a heal Renegade and refusing to use its huge staff CC.
---
By being there on Samarog on healbrand, you're broadcasting loudly: "I've chosen the healer that can Aegis every slam, so don't dodge, just trust me." If you plan on ignoring your niche entirely, you need to tell your group, because otherwise you've completely sabotaged them by not actually playing your class in the usual, expected fashion.
---
About Fractals. Solo them is nothing you do if you just reached lvl 80. You have a lot more to learn before this ever happen. Fractals are the dungeons of this game and group content that you play with 4 others.
---
There are a climb from 1-100 fractals who are divided in to 4 thiers. The first tier is the easier one were you learn with other newer players or players who just enjoy. After tier 1 you will have to add agony resistance to your gear which you can only do on ascended gear. People been giving you info on how to craft so i leave that. 
---
Fractals do also have daily. If you walk up to the fractal entry and look at the first tab you will see what i recomended and daily fractals. Those are easy to find groups for because everybody are doing them. And here is were the lfg-tool comes in 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Looking_For_Group
---
You open it move to the fractal tab and to the tier 1 tab and either add your group were you write what fractal you want to do. Like say you want to do daily then you write that. Or you want to do a specific say 11 then you write that and add the group and wait for it to fill up.
---
Remember though that you are kind of leveling up the fractals so if you have not reach say as an example fractal 33, then you can only open up fractals from 33 and under. If you want to make fractal 73, then someone in your grou need to be at that level or higher to be able to open it for you.
---
Info you did not ask for but fractals can be much fun so just making sure you understand how to get in to them :)
---
Now we need a ghost outfit so we can fully cosplay Charlie Brown.
---
&gt;I got a rock...
---
id rather have a new IP
---
yeah thats a really good point
---
Do you have a source on Gw1 being the second biggest game in the mmo market? not saying its impossible just seems unlikely to me.
---
Other than streamer personality, I usually just watch to learn from the players. Top raiders / top PvPers. See what they play, how they play it, etc.
---
Unless you're amazing at the game, you've got to be entertaining to watch and listen to.
---
for active players, yes. But someone who played on launch for two weeks and has since left could come back to three insta-80 scrolls. Is an 80 scroll really that different from a 60 scroll? I don't know, but you can certainly see why ANet would have a reason to cut off the scroll arms race. Especially since it's a pretty pointless reward for vets.
---
Maybe I'm a bit of an asshole for doing this but what I basicly did was farm the map on every character. Try to kill rifts asap before ppl came in. If there were too many ppl waiting I would just tag the event and go do a heart, come back later to loot the chest. That way I would not lose time on farming. Sometimes i could do the south heart and middle heart before the event was done.
---
This is a great video series, keep it up.
---
I think you'd have some difficulty even getting to Victory or Death, especially if the Fort Concordia instance breaks again.
---
Lol, I read "Victory Rytlock" first.

I thought "Wtf?! A Rytlock chair?!! xD

Season 4 definitely is more than an hour between episodes 5 and 6 alone.

I use Silver's tool (which Silver made when I requested it. He's very open to new ideas for tools that would be useful) to record the exotics and the rare greatswords so I can get an ave value of those. For other rares, those are salvaged separately from the masterworks and from the fines so that I can separate out the ave material drop rate from each tier.  
---
Process for greens:  
---
open bags on a character  
---
move all exotics and rares to bank  
---
salvage masterworks  
---
repeat until bank full  
---
move exotics, rares, rare greatswords on to separate characters  
---
salvage rares  
---
go back to opening and sorting  
---
When I'm done with my batch, I record the number of exotics, rares, and rare greatswords. Subtract that number from the total number of unids and that's how many masterworks were salvaged. The mats from salvaging rares are tracked separately. Exotics are processed through either sell on tp or extract/forging (need to have a good sample on ave return of exotics in the forge to get a good sell over value). Rare greatswords are recorded to get the drop rate of each type and then listed on tp.  
---
For blues, similar process but I also separate out the masterworks from the fines.  
---
For rares, just rare greatswords and exotics saved and the rest of the rares salvaged until bank is full.  
---
When the current sample size reaches the size I want, I'll stop separating out the tiers and only save exotics and rare greatswords. I'll just track that with ave cost spent on salvaging and then the total ave mats for all items salvaged. This will eventually save a bunch of time in that I won't have to swap characters as often.  
---
If you have limited bag space, bank space, and characters, tracking unid rates can be an incredibly huge hassle. (I have 320 slots  on multiple characters, max bank, and max characters).
---
Only crushed you yes.
---
Classy.

Creepypasta material

Just out of curiosity I searched for the sheet.  She kept it up to date for about a year and a half after publishing it.  Last update was August 2017.  It really was some impressive work.
---
?  idk i think that's a fucking fantastic addition.
---
OK, so i just took the time to view this video.  
---
And honestly it really seems like hes making money from making video game vids on YouTube.  
---
he totally lost my respect when he lost hes shit because he lost to a Mesmer build.  
---
honestly if you criticize the game get off it, dont make a crying video.  
---
me on the other hand, i enjoy it. i am a casual.  
---
i dont need to hear peoples opinions.
---
to each their own.

Exactly all of the currency i don't wanna waste on crap ;-;

Always a little telling when the banned people don't provide any screens but claim they didn't do anything
---
Try at server reset if possible
---
Im assuming you mean this event ? https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kill_the_Orrian_Terror
---
Riagan should turn into a merchant after the event and you can buy the item from him then.
---
I feel like I am out of the loop. Who is ERP and why is it recently getting posted here?
---
It is but it can become extremely repetitive to a poi t you just look at the feet if you have a slight ocd :(
---
I hated thief for a LONG time early on, made and deleted multiple toons to try and make it work. Eventually something just clicked and my thief became my main and most loved/played toon.
---
The Rytlock chair can't be a rocking chair, though, or all the charr would catch their poor tails in the rockers.
---
Also, if they released a Rytlock chair, I'd hope they would also update it to have Rytlock wearing a Santa hat for Wintersday. Think of all the screenshot opportunities!
---
Acussing me of a lack of reading comprehension while you completly fail to understand the argument says a lot to be honest. 
---
For example, i never said your homophobic, i just used that particular example. I could have just as easily said it's the same as white people hating on drags because they cloth differently. The point was to show that the gameworld does not revolve around your narrow mindset. A lot of people quite enjoy the multiple effects gw2 offers, if not why would they have them on. And again, if you don't like seeing them, play something different. They affect no part of gameplay whatsoever, you just chose to be offended.
---
How we either get ride of tanks/healers in raids and make it like the rest of GW2 or give it a real system to follow(not saying the traditional system just something that doesn’t make the game feel so schizophrenic)
---
&gt; reward for vets
---
I'd love the ability to double my max ingredient storage capacity. A lot of Legendaries need 9,000 to 12,000 of certain items, and I can only hold 2,000 of each in storage.
---
Easy way to get a full set of marauder armor (or just any stat available to your account) is to join an organized verdant brink map and get T4. Chest from T4 gets you a chest piece and with 2500 of the, extremely easily farmed, map currency you can get the other 5 pieces of armor. It's exotic but basically free.
---
What do these skins look like anyways?

[Think I'm ok](https://i.imgur.com/ur6a8Fm.png)

Where do you guys get different skins for armor? I find only generic ones, mostly..

I have a ton of shards, but my tickets are required for legendary armor.

|gw2 is dying because they didnt monetize content that i demanded not be monetizeable

|gw2 is dying because they monetized content that makes sense to monetize without disrupting any core gameplay or systems.

do you even want to pick one or did you just come here to spew

Was hoping for an extra scroll for a new alt to skip to like lvl 60 or 70 or something. Shame.

unpopular opinion: these birthday gifts should ONLY be for active players....!!!
---
Sick trailer, way better than most anet trailers/teasers.
---
I waited until they relaxed the timegates then got the skyscale in 3 days (I had already been saving map currency) using only 1 character.
---
I also remarked on how torturing it was but it is now my most used mount so I guess it was worth it.
---
Congratulations. You just aggregated two different community opinions from an unknown number of people and then claimed that OP is trying to say both. That doesn't make any sense.
---
should've done what I did, fuck farming, I went all out on the dragon bash exchange event.

it did cost me 500g but I didn't have to farm any mfking, stinking map currency (spews on the ground)

40-50 days? I did mine in less than a week (after the timegating was loosened up.)

Even 4chan has rules on what is allowed there. any forum can set limits what is allowed. if you don't like it you are free to start your own. it is not censorship, it's filtering.

Reworked maps* some video a while back mentioned possibly less new maps and changing current ones. Not sure how I feel about that.
---
Yes it is.

Actually, I have a few commanders I actually respected.  One is okay in terms of actual fights, very nice tactics and able to usually take out larger zergs.  The other I have more respect is a commander who employed strategy.  Despite being overwhelmed by the other 2 worlds, he was very clever and able to move fast and quick from much, much larger zergs and able to take keeps and more very efficiently.  He also great communication skills and, if needed, was also tactical when fights did happen.
---
Both of those commanders were also mature which I think helped.
---
The thing is, I think commanders are able to employ lots of thinking and skill.  But basically most who follow just do that, follow.  They simply go wherever the commander goes and do what the commanders tell them to do.  
---
Anyway, those who prefer that, great.   Some (most) love to just zerg and follow and if you have fun, then great.  I'm just part of the smaller crowd that much more enjoys roaming.

Amen to that mate!

Have almost 200k myself and it would be great to spend it.

You stated your music taste in your thread....I dunno, maybe you expect too much from a guild/online friend. Just chat with random people in the game, dont be shy. What could happen? A fist coming out your screen punching you in the face?

I dont have a problem with shyness, and I dont think I'm being overly picky if I want common ground with my friends. I appreciate it though

Yeah these NPCs are there for Kiel’s speech. I didnt check this year if she was there or not but last year she definitely was, maybe the devs just vanished them without completely removing them.

Just wondering... What's your age?

??? Maybe you should just equip more basic weapons? I do get that other people’s armor combos skew to the flash but there’s nothing stopping you from using more realistic weapons. Unless u mean the effects were better then
