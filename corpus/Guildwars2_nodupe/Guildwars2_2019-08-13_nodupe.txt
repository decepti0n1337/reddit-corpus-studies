Yes it is.

Actually, I have a few commanders I actually respected.  One is okay in terms of actual fights, very nice tactics and able to usually take out larger zergs.  The other I have more respect is a commander who employed strategy.  Despite being overwhelmed by the other 2 worlds, he was very clever and able to move fast and quick from much, much larger zergs and able to take keeps and more very efficiently.  He also great communication skills and, if needed, was also tactical when fights did happen.
---

---
Both of those commanders were also mature which I think helped.
---
The thing is, I think commanders are able to employ lots of thinking and skill.  But basically most who follow just do that, follow.  They simply go wherever the commander goes and do what the commanders tell them to do.  
---
Anyway, those who prefer that, great.   Some (most) love to just zerg and follow and if you have fun, then great.  I'm just part of the smaller crowd that much more enjoys roaming.
---
Amen to that mate!  
---
Have almost 200k myself and it would be great to spend it.
---
You stated your music taste in your thread....I dunno, maybe you expect too much from a guild/online friend. Just chat with random people in the game, dont be shy. What could happen? A fist coming out your screen punching you in the face?
---
I dont have a problem with shyness, and I dont think I'm being overly picky if I want common ground with my friends. I appreciate it though
---
Yeah these NPCs are there for Kiel‚Äôs speech. I didnt check this year if she was there or not but last year she definitely was, maybe the devs just vanished them without completely removing them.
---

---
Just wondering... What's your age?
---
??? Maybe you should just equip more basic weapons? I do get that other people‚Äôs armor combos skew to the flash but there‚Äôs nothing stopping you from using more realistic weapons. Unless u mean the effects were better then
---
RIP Detection Pulse
---
I think the path of fire preparation pack is still on sale, it comes with a set of tools, a character slot, and a few other things. It‚Äôs a fairly good deal if the other stuff in it interests you, otherwise it‚Äôs probably not worth it.
---
I have constant 300 ping. Always wished I could play thief without delays on everything. I practically catch up to my shortbow 5 before the warp takes effect.
---
No, it's a statement of fact. Arenanet has said repeatedly that they are not working on Guild Wars 3 and have no plans to work on Guild Wars 3.
---
Everyone who has played the game for a while and completed story is content starved, aside from those who play to collect stuff. PvP players have been complaining for years now; and now PvE players are joining in to. 
---
The game allows you to play it on and off and if that's the way you play then you have a whole heap of content, but if you play it as your main game most people run out of interesting things to do at some point. I think Anet knows this because they've planned a substantial announcement to keep players interested in the game.
---
You might have missed ‚ÄúWvW‚Äù in the title
---
There is no point in raising the level cap. All that would do is piss off people who would have to re-grind gear and they would get a mass exodus of players just like when they introduced ascended vs exotic. Then the balance team will have to deal with nightmare power creep on top and rebalance most skills, stat combinations, runes etc. Then they pretty much have to remake a lvl90 version of many items including new food buffs. This would actually destroy the game.
---
I am about 90% done with skyscale collections now (been back 2 weeks since quitting right before POF release).. can confirm, these collections are so bad that I am almost burned out and king about quitting again. Thia thing should have unlocked like 5 collections ago at the latest.. I now need to farm more currencies in alts and find another 20 things and (I think) I will be done.
---
Because they either had the currencies or grinded it on multiple characters.. tho 40-50 is a little bit exaggerated it still takes too long if you gotta farm from nowhere and only do it on one character
---
Check the skins you like on the wardrobe, search the Wiki on how to obtain them, and that's it.
---
Awesome thank you for making these üòÅüëç
---
Wow...simply...wow...
---
People of GW2 Reddit are just as amusing as people of Walmart.
---
Oh no rest assured i did no. Kill faster than they can kill you, you have enough evades and arcane shield to mitigate long enough to get a few kills and win the fights. 
---
Full zerker, twist of fate, arcane shield to cover m√©tiers or anything else, and Lightning‚Äôs flash. 
---
If you use these all properly you should have no problem skirting around the battles, including fire staff 4
---
If you get stuck in a corner or on a stack you‚Äôre dead regardless and no amount of vitality is going to save poor positioning
---
I‚Äôm assuming you know the fire staff 4 meteor trick with the optional lighting flash to drop meteor from almost 3k range away
---
\*foranycontentatallImightactuallypayatthispoint
---
It's nice but I'll be honest I never understood the obsession with chairs.
---
I can think of 10000 other things more than 5 players want that need that need to be done before this stuff.
---
Yes, but not the same. :(
---
Or a Holo / Mesmer :3
---
And also maybe even officially support it
---
I don't know I have been playing this daily since launch, I play with friends so maybe that helps.
---
Yes, it is in Diessa Plateau I think. Or where COF map is. Middle left.
---
Also, whether or not someone likes the nature of the content or what modes it goes in, the cadence of season 3 and season 4 were utter insanity given the sheer amount of new art, music, environment design and voice work. A non-trivial amount of the music in those seasons was orchestral, and quite a bit of the audio was new and foleyed.
---
You look at other non-MMO games, and they simply do not put out audio and visual content at that pace. You look at other MMO games... and they don't either. Most other MMOs call new tiers of numbers "content". And while other MMOs add raids at a higher cadence than GW2, they also aren't concerned with adding zones between expansions.
---
True, but it is a nice homage.

[removed]
---
The solution is to leave the game forever.
---
The only character I had from the 3 day early access was deleted many years ago T.T gonna have to wait another 2 years it seems.
---
And then photoshop Joko's face in the background. It'll be perfect.
---
WoW is literally the most successful mmo of all time and still likely the largest mmo...
---
You can recover old characters.
---
They may not be able to recover ones that were deleted that long ago. After a lot of major updates, it gets harder to recover them.
---
im also stuck at this collection, as i have only weekends available to play, its taking forever, so much grinding on maps i dont even like
---
Try the mistward armor with magmaton it's probably going to look nice died with Reds and oranges
---
Bad advice
---
I'm really not sure what side you're even on.
---
Sometimes it does yeah
---
That's not true, I had a character recovered and she still has the same birthday
---
The wiki is outdated; I opened one less than a week ago and was able to choose viper; the whole list was there, I think.
---
I had almost 0 of every currency because I came back from a massive hiatus. It's not that long if you have a lot of alt characters.
---
Couldn't you get it sooner if you didn't wait though? What was the point of waiting?
---
What are you on about?
---
Ye lets just have everything buyable with credit card.
---
dibs
---
I know I said it before but imagine if it was just 7 Mini Queen Jenna's lmao
---
&gt; Of course, many of those same people come to reddit complain about 2 hours of content every four months, do the story and leave the zone. Some of us play the zone and get the currency.
---
Repeating zones over and over in the hopes the currency might become useful in 6 months time doesn't nullify their complaint.
---
im on the side that doesnt understand why you would defend people who come to this subreddit just to spew nonsense and create nonsense drama. what side does that put you on?
---
Well you don't have to wait longer, you just have to wait til a later date. Seven years is sevem years no matter when you start. But I get the frustration cause there are nice skins that have been discontinued while I was on break that I really want. I think a fair trade would be being able to purchase one of the sets, and maybe previous year gifts. I think letting the OG's get at least one yesr to flaunt our... rock would be nice and keep everyone happy.
---
Deadeye is everything I ever wanted in thief. It's so fun to just zip into a fight and annihilate with pistols.
---
after next game update, then should give you best odds of getting it.
---
I like that idea, selling them a year later. Even two years later wouldn't be that bad. It also helps people who only have maybe 1 or 2 characters that old since you only unlock one set per birthday.
---
this is hella cute!!! u/kianga i'm heading to your tumblr because this deserves more reblog! ooh maybe i'll follow you too :3
---
Message me your ign and I'll get one of the admins to add you
---
agree. slow character movement is not a problem with mounts
---
Yeah. I could understand trying within a week or so but I deleted it just about 2yrs after launch so it's been a good few years now. So I doubt they would even bother trying for me.
---
I wouldn't get my hopes up on getting any PvP/WvW related updates &gt;!or anything of substance tbh!&lt;
---
I did t want to do it sooner than that. The game isn't a job... I only do things when I feel like doing them
---
Yeah, storage space would be a fantastic reward!! I have too many friggin boosters from these presents, I'd love things like new character slots or bank space or more material storage.
---
Great idea
---
Pull windows key out of keyboard
---
Does this mean Guild Wars Utopia is on the table? :D
---
Staff has a symbol that grants swiftness, Guardian also has 2 shouts that have swiftness. It is very easy to have permanent swiftness on Guardian. Also Greatsword is fantastic for movement and damage.

Every so often I watch GvG tournaments. I used to watch dungeon speed runners because the music was nice and it was interesting to see the techniques. Purple Miku was pretty popular for good music+absolutely ridiculous techniques for undermanning dungeons. They still pop on every so often testing out some map breaking here and there.
---
I haven't updated the spreadsheet to the current balance, but this looks like you're playing glass vs someone still playing a twinked out ranger build with all the multipliers and just came down onto you.

I'm waiting for people to say that unironically to this post as LoS only really works vs longbow.

GW1 isn't being played for the same reason UO, EQ, DAoC and every other game isn't being played anymore. They're fucking old and only populated by the most die-hard fans. Which are very few people by definition.
---
But hey, if the guy with the toxic flair says something, it has to be true. "Second biggest MMO". Yea. Right.
---
Yes. Instant gratification. Now.
---
Mate, if you dont like working for things, Id suggest not playing any kind of MMO. While GW2 is already the most easy mode laidback MMO version in existence, what you want goes absolutely against the core of this game genre, namely: work towards a goal, enjoy the way towards it (preferrably with others, but well... its GW2) and then be proud of your accomplishments.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So, because Im getting told this a lot as well, here now this subreddits sage advice to you: If you dont like it, leave.
---
&gt;a mass exodus of players just like when they introduced ascended vs exotic
---
In all fairness, if any players claimed to have left because the 3-month-old game added an equipment tier that had stats 5% higher than the stuff that was so easy to acquire that they had already outfitted their characters in it, then they were probably looking for an excuse to quit. At any rate, they weren't likely to stick around through the following months/years.
---
Then why is the character the one who benefits?
---
Nonsense, Anet is stupid, doesn't know their own game, are utterly incompetent in every aspect, only care about whales and their cash shop anyway, and ruin the game with their stupid casual non-content open world releases that never have anything to do, ever.
---
Did exactly this. Also got it in 3 days. And that was me playing a casual 2 hours per day squeezed in with other dailies I do.
---
who cares... XD
---
I don‚Äôt remember the recipe but you can use the mystic forge to make more shards from shards.
---
I finished that grind and still like my griffon, the skyscale is the fugliest mount ever, not to mention its clumsy af maneuvering. The griffon is smooth, wish they would make the griffon the flyer instead.
---
1. Is pretty impossible given that I know for a fact she got HoT from Anet and I bought her PoF as a gift. 2. Is more likely.
---

---
Probably, we got djinn‚Äôs domain for S4
---
Djinns domain map a few months ago
---
Well have you noticed the shields are still up?
---
Yeap ^^ still a large amount of shards needed tho, I think the ascended version is like 250
---
Working for whales, and people that cant see the rest of the game is deteriorating. Naw ima stand here looking all shiny in my store bought outfit and mount, pfft who needs new content and game modes fixed. Just buy buy buy and show it off.
---
too bad you missed the previous black lion chest contents, i got enough sprockets to make the ascended spinal blades and infuse them and colour them red. all the ingredients were available via a vendor to buy every component in hoelbrak during the dragon bash festival.
---
Who said there will not be a dedicated queue for 2v2 ? Just your own assumptions based or they specified ¬´¬†no queue for 2v2¬†¬ª ?
---
Again, stealth. That invisible telegraph is still invisible.  Smokescale is one of the higher damage pets, so there really is no reason not to be taking it anyways.
---
The pattern is usually respected but the exact date can vary depending on big patches dates: you always have at least 2 weeks between 2 big patches (big patches can include LS episode release, festival, balance patch, side stories, etc).
---
I would say that for Halloween  your assumptions are probably correct considering they would need to chain Halloween, a big update and then Wintersday in a rather narrow window so they will probably not play with the exact dates too much.
---
(Also as a side note, wth is wrong with where you work that you need a 2-month notice???)
---
Desert is the only theme they know so forget it.
---
&gt;In all fairness, if any players claimed to have left because the 3-month-old game added \[a higher\] equipment tier then they were probably looking for an excuse to quit.
---
I was one of those players, although I came back after about a year and a half. Was primarily repping a PvP guild at the time and people there were FURIOUS that they were being "forced" to do PvE (Fractals) to get best-in-slot gear since nothing Ascended was available in sPvP or WvW at the time. The 5% figure you site is meaningless. It could have been 25%, or 0.5%, and the reaction would still have been the same. 
---
The perception was that ArenaNet was showing undue favoritism to the PvE crowd, causing a lot of disillusionment in the PvP crowd, many of us lost our motivation to log in and decided to play other stuff for a while. I had my own unrelated reasons for coming back but many of the others didn't. I realize this is all irrelevant today because of how much the game has changed, I just want people who weren't around then to realize what a mess this was at the time and (continue to) pray it never happens again.
---
Nah, we'll get some ice themed chairs though

why watch twitch?

but more seriously: personality is the only way to differentiate yourself from other streamers
---
Abyssal forest, I neeeeeeed it.
---
I spent the 400 gold for Celestial Blue. Super worth, I'm using it on so many characters.
---
Dyes I hope to choose between:
---
* Abyssal Forest ~700G (TP Buy)
---
* Arcane ~500G (TP Buy)
---
* Permafrost ~170G (TP Buy - probably just gonna buy this one)
---
Honourary mentions: Cerulean Night Sky, Cerulean Sky, Radiant Gold, Nightmare
---
I was really looking forward to my lvl 70 boost, I wasn't touching a new character until after the anniversary. But if there's no boost, I'll dump a buttload of tomes on her instead.
---
I really regret my decision to only have one character for the first year or two. No lvl 60 boost for me this year.
---
But to make myself feel less bad, my roommate/best friend played gw2 from the beginning... But for the first couple years she kept changing and remaking the same character... Her 7 year birthday is 4 years off even though she's played from the beginning :')
---
It should lead you to buy black lion keys.
---
did I ever said that? is the cadence of pvp and wvw releases shit? yes, ofc. 
---
**that doesnt make a pvp release not not content though** 
---
get that in your fucking heads already.
---
oh, thanks for pointing that out, I edited the question
---
Hey, I want my foes to be literally blinded by my great sense in fashion!
---
yes pls! i hated every single minute of doing map completion a few weeks back. my gaming was really depressing :(
---
It's a pass from me. I got a key from map completion recently and it got me the new mount, so I'm set.
---
First of all, the entire topic is about the 2v2 map and 2v2 queue.  Bringing up Djinn's Dominion, a release from NOVEMBER 3RD 2018, is off topic and irrelevant.  
---
Yes of course a new map is "content," but when that "content" was from nearly ONE YEAR AGO, it's irrelevant to the discussion at hand and honestly, the other guy shouldn't even have mentioned since it's irrelevant.  
---
And YES it's perfectly fine for me to think that ONE map back at the END of 2018 isn't enough PvP content to keep me interested.  
---
If you re-read my post (which you didn't cuz you know you gotta have a knee jerk reaction to everything because that's what people like you do) you'd notice I said "I'm not sure a new map counts as "quality pvp content."  I NEVER said it WASN'T content.  
---
Get THAT through YOUR fucking head already :P
---
I did the same thing. I'm a compulsive restarter, and I didn't get situated on a main until around HoT? (And I've since mostly moved on from my poor guardian.)
---
Yes of course releases are relevant due to time.  A fast enough release schedule = keeping players invested.  Not enough releases = not keeping players invested.  SO YES. TIME MATTERS.  If you think time doesn't matter in terms of releases you're living in some sort of fantasy land.  
---
Regardless, that still doesn't change the fact that the topic is 2v2 queues and 2v2 maps and the current release, NOT Djinn's Dominion from 10 months ago
---
Also way to dodge the fact that you misquoted me.  There's never any admitting that they were wrong for people like you
---
Should we also be able to get WvW rewards while doing PvE?
---
Legendaries require you to play (or 'play' and grind, if you don't enjoy it) multiple modes of the game. If anything, i'd also add a gift from PvP being required to craft a Legendary, although getting the mode-specific gifts (Exploration, Battle, etc) might each be slightly less time-consuming.
---
The whole 4 winds festival is by far the most boring and unrewarding festival in the game. Its nothing more than a sink for time and materials.
---
Now compare that to necro axe skills animations.
---
also has the biggest reward pool though. dont forget that not only 7 year vets are playing these events.
---
and I would argue for CNY to be the worst festival.
---
Perma's in the six-year gift
---
&gt; I've been hoping for two anniversaries now that they would swap those over to an adoption license equivalent
---
I am not sure that having an anniversary gift that require you to buy a specific expansion is a good idea.
---
The new map is last that PvP actually needs. We need new rewards (hello real Legendary armor and rings). We need "battle pass" to sustain player retention and teach people basic stuff like "make 20 blast combos", EXCLUSIVE to each gamemode. And we definitely need meaningful balance updates.
---
Excuse me, WvW doesn't require any skill too. All you have to do is pew-pew people from range and brainlessly follow the tag. You will get participation, ticks, reward track progres and everything.
---
Depends on your definition of played, when i needed a GoB i joined a blob and ran around until i had t6 then waited it out while semiafking with killing the occasional guard to keep up the participation. That took exactly 0 skill and only required some time to complete.
---
The Festival of the Four Winds is more designed for spending gold instead of getting. 
---
However, 11-13g/h is absolutely fine. It doesn't always have to be more than the 18g/h you get from SW. 
---
And tbh, you can make 60g/h+ at halloween which is actually waaayy too much. One extremly high rewarded festival per year is enough.
---
I‚Äôve been logging in just for those 3 days every year to flex. Got good 1,5k hours out of the game, so it was worth it, even though 80% of that was before they launched ascended gear. Still salty about it, made me pretty much quit the game.
---
Im Sure you are convinced that most pve Events( aka Hit tue objektive twice then wait for rewards Like the hot Meta Events) are hard. I think we Just differ there then. But stating that you get Things so much quicker in wvw is Just objectively wrong. Play wvw and Turn on the Farmer on GW2 efficiency and then do it while doing any Meta Event.
---
Who stated wvw needs Skill? All the threadmaker wants to say is that it would be a good Idea Not having to Play a gamemode which you dont WANTto Play. Its a Game after all.
---
Wish they'd added them to reward tracks instead of Skirmish tickets. Already have 2 sets for tickets, reward tracks have been useless for a long time now for anyone who spends a decent amount of time in WvW.
---
That's about 760 gold worth of badges there. I'd start spending some if i were u.
---
I honestly dont know what you are on about since you asked if i had played WvW.  
---
And if you reread it what i said was to add the GoB to a PvE mode where i can AFK to get it just as OP suggests that you can get Gift of Exploration by AFKing in WvW.
---
you mean structure pvp?
---
And yes to have your own/guild arena you need to use [Custom Arena Starter Kit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Custom_Arena_Starter_Kit).  
---
If you want to play with your friends you can try to ask around in [Heart of the Mists](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_Mists) if anyone can "borrow" you their arena for that night. What they can do is set a password and then only you and your friends, for example, will have it. Or you can just join those arenas that dont have a password and are there for free to use and hope you dont get griefers joining when they see 4/10.  
---
For real, ask around i am sure people don't mind to share you their arena, in my guild we used to do that in enchange of [Custom Arena Time Tokens](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Custom_Arena_Time_Token) to extend our timer, but we closed the arena for lack of interest in the last few months.
---
even then its slightly better than just doing a matt gathering route for 10 mins
---
Just because we \*can\* organize literally everything ourselves doesn't mean that we \*should\*. Anet has been completely absent for ANY tournaments that have been organized in the last 2 years, even though adding gem prizes to community driven tournaments would be so easy for them to do.   
---
Also calling people "dumb fucks" on the interwebz will only get you downvotes, especially when it comes from a place of ignorance.
---
Yea, just until they banned Kripparian in 2012 for "showing exploit on stream".
---
I don‚Äôt like the idea. If a reward is part of specific content you should have to engage with it. I get that it can feel bad having to do something you don‚Äôt enjoy. I‚Äôve the same feeling every time I need a Gift of Battle.
---
Imo dungeon rewardtracks were a mistake too. It shouldn‚Äôt be possible to unlock every (dungeon) reward literally without entering a dungeon once. 
---
Having to play different content  is pretty healthy for the game/gamemodes in general.
---
i'd rather see this :)

Not the helpful answer you hoped for, but: Did you report this bug? Many ppl complain about bugs for weeks (also here) without even reporting it. 
---
For example there was a bug with the CC mechanic from Matthias (Raid Boss), many ppl mentioned and complained about it on reddit and at any time a Dev answered, that they didn't even know about this bug. All of these people complained, but nobody reported it officially. 
---
I don't want to blame you, just remind you. :)
---
What a pointless point.
---
What a pointless post.
---
Yes, it is specifically the Astral Weapons you need.

I mean, it's litterally called "Vision of Equipment: **Astral Weapons**"
---
Congratulations Shinji!
---
he took 22k, there is few builds that would have survived the first hit.
---
I‚Äôm always changing stats, trying to make new builds and all that good stuff. Even though meta battle builds are pretty good, they are predictable and when you play an off meta build, it usually throws people off
---
[Box of supplies](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Box_of_WvW_Supplies) Probablys given me like 50 levels past 3 or so years
---
oh boy
---
i got my skyscale in less than 2 weeks! i have only 1 character and i played maybe 1-2 hours per day.
---
it's not grindy at all! it seems that many people forget what grind means.
---
&gt; Anet has been completely absent for ANY tournaments that have been organized in the last 2 years
---
I got this from the official matcherino tournament details:
---
&gt; the previous ERPs have been funded by myself, ArenaNet and the fantastic support of the Guild Wars 2 community in the forms of truly absurd amounts of in game currency
---
&gt; Just because we *can* organize literally everything ourselves doesn't mean that we *should*
---
Correct me if I am wrong but I heard that support from Anet was offered but declined from teapot.
---
&gt; even though adding gem prizes to community driven tournaments would be so easy for them to do
---
There are already over 30k gems in the pool (besides over 2700$ and 150k gold) for an event that has probably has less than 100 participants spread over 6-8 teams (tourney description is unclear there). I wonder what additional impact you think adding another 30k gems to it from Anet will have. I dont think it will change the tiny amount of particpants and viewers (compared to the whole player base) of this event.
---
&gt; Also calling people "dumb fucks" on the interwebz will only get you downvotes, especially when it comes from a place of ignorance.
---
Not if you address a dump fuck. For now, my comment is marked as controversial which means it got a solid amount of upvotes as well.
---
I can't wait for the next seven years
---
with leg armor i swapped that's \~80 times in 1year of PvE
---
Honestly for me it's more more modes.  Stronghold was stillborn, which is unfortunate as it had potential, but just needed proper care and updates.  
---
Non-conquest modes would be good.  2v2, 3v3, Capture the Flag (not spirit watch style capture the flag).  Maybe small 10v10 or 15v15 warzones or something.  Just something different.  I've wanted this for like 4 years, too, btw and I know a fair amount of my friends that PvP also have wanted other modes (nonconquest) for a long time.  
---
Also the removal of Team Queue/Mixed Queue from Ranked completely killed pvp for me and about 20 other people I know, which is unfortunate since "Solo Duo is something the community wanted" but in my experience it had a pretty huge negative impact on the community as a whole, much more so than Mixed Queue.
---
As much as I hate pve, the thing I liked the most about making a legendary was trying out all the game modes available in the game. However once I was done, I gladly returned to wvw/pvp and I‚Äôm stalling making my next legendary cuz it‚Äôs too early for me to pve again..
---
I mean if you stream no hit challenge on Dark Souls, or lets say you're a pro player at some esport game, listening to the stream in the background doesn't really work. 
---
In MMOs that is generally not the case however and I agree it mostly comes down to the level of entertainment one streamer can provide on his own. 
---
However in this community we have ppl like Sindrener who has a respectable amount of views. IMO he is not an exceptional streamer, nor a bad one, but his level of play and knowledge in sPvP is so important for anyone in this game who wants to reach those high levels in the ranks.
---
I was pretty active *before* I became disabled, for several hours a day. It was a lot more fun actually *doing* exercise than *watching* it. I *still* get bored watching sports, because it's  mostly just watching people chase a ball/wrestle each other/do random pointless physical thing, even if I can't do it *anymore*.  
---
I did like watching figureskating when I was younger, just because it's super pretty and I was terrible at it, but that's the exception. :)
---
These guys are all literally trying to milk the community in the quiet period between two seasons.
---
"ANet spams the gem store to milk the players"
---
*... spams videos to milk the players...*
---
Tasty delicious player milk.
---
you're right, some do. So I'm happy for them.  
---
On the other hand there are definitely a lot of people like me out there that could care less, so I'm not sure it qualifies as quality pvp updates.  But you're right, I'm glad it's there for the people that want them.  
---
More legendary armor/backpieces for WvW/PvP would definitely entice me to play more, not just random sets of weapons.  The new Armor they released in the past year was something I ended up playing more PvP to get pieces of
---
Yeh very easy... I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a commander in wvw and you know exactly what your doing in blob fights. YES blobs vs pug groups are ez af, but when it‚Äôs two blobs who are on discord, the fights get really intense. I agree getting rewards in wvw is brainless but core wvw players don‚Äôt really care about that. We want to have good fights and the reward comes when the entire enemy blob is in downed state and we just walk over them spamming 1. Honestly best feeling ever, especially when you have a good comm who knows how to control 50 players.
---
Problem is that actual swap in WvW should be done in 1 click. Since when I run to my group solo I would enjoy other set of stats to kill occasional roamer. Then in mid scale 10-15 groups sometimes we need more dps from FB and in 30+ man groups you go full defensive. All that could happen in matter of minute or two with enemies in site. Sitting and changing drop down menus is not an option.
---
i love everything about this game, and i enjoy all game modes, but doing that map completion for the 3rd or 4th time really took its toll on me :(
---
TL;DR It's like WoW but with nice graphics.
---
Well I know this isn‚Äôt popular in wvw, but why don‚Äôt you try 1v1 builds? Also I‚Äôve recently been seeing the DH burn build that has huge burst dmg.
---
I think I was confusing it with the paths for resources, dry bones and sandworn pages.
---
You also got some in year 6 iirc. I've got 2 seven years, one six, two five and so on, so the gifts do stack up quite a bit lol.
---
I'm actually making an effort to see what dyes are available in the various dye packs, maybe get some more bank slots freed up.
---
sooo what about straight up selling blue and green unids?
---
This is so true! I mean if you went on the EVE sub you'd think the entire game was filled with psychopaths who feed on the tears of their victims... Oh wait never mind that's actually true so...
---
Gw2 efficiency will also show you how many years your character has, and when their next present is due
---
I can't think of any of those items that won't help all your characters. I mean the wardrobe unlocks are account wide, the novelty is unlocked account wide, and every character is still getting their own Year 7 gift so...
---
Yes, character typefucking that is caused by one side (casuals because are raids are too hard for them) towards Raiders (who tell them its not too hard) and casuals call Raiders toxic and elitist exactly because of that. "Elitist Raiding Party" is the Raiding meme because casuals shit on them thinking that its so. Casuals are the majority and are toxic towards any minority that asks for anything that isn't casual, safely calling out from the crowd.
---
I'm talking about getting Gift of Battle. Gift of Exploration - no skill, only time. Gift of Battle - no skill, only time. WvW isn't better, it is just other game mode, where mobs are replaced by players. And people are running after the commander because it's tagged. People needs directions, and they're going where everyone does. There is no big brain time. Try do it without any tag with random people and it won't work.
---
Why do you think raiders are toxic? Its the casuals that are toxic to anyone who wants non-casual content because they are the majority and because they don't want content that they can't play (or don't want to) despite casual content outnumbering the hardcore one probably 200/1. When the minorities call the casual majority out for their toxicity, casuals bury them by calling them toxic and elitist. That is the meme of the "Elitist Raiding Party".
---
Aquatic Stance is not that good in solo play imo but it can be very nice with other people (especially other Weavers).  For Open World I really like the healing Glyph because of the short CD and you can even go for Inscrption in Air to get down to 16 sec for a 6.5k heal.
---
With Sword I still tend to run Fire+Air because the bonuses from those 2 branches look too good to pass them even without Quickness/Alacrity. Arcane Shield is also a skill worth considering as well as Signet of Fire (in a more offensive pick) for those sweet crits. To have larger margin of error I can also recommend [Master's Fortitude](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Master%27s_Fortitude) trait to get a big health boost at the cost of Weakness uptime on the enemy (might be worth it on non bosses) and some crit chance.
---
Congratulate yourself rather, you just did the exact thing I said xD
---
Turn down your ego meters and go do your daily WB run, your reasoning is just as dumb as their difficulty.
---
KappaPride
---
I personally didn't complain about needing currency, I just did the same heart on all my characters.
---
Locking new content behind old content going back over 6 months is a bad design. Even if these people had continued playing the maps, they might have spent the currency already and then are later punished for that. 
---
It's not additional content, it's forcing people to replay old content they're likely done with.
---
But raiding is casual... For casuals.
---
I think raiders that only raid are the toxic ones because as you say they only want raids and nothing else and they don't want other content. But then they claim themselves as elitists to seperate themselves from other casuals to feel superior and create memes and toxicity, their main objective is to destroy the game and not letting it grow.
---
I think not banning him for brazenly breaking ToS (and flaunting it) by using a disallowed mod is a decent compromise on Anets part.
---
But, *tofu packet* either way ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Wow is a sub game but it‚Äôs new expansions are sub par to say the least. And it has a cash shop to boot. I don‚Äôt know if final fantasy has a cash shop but people only seem to be happy with that one. 
---
And the problem with sub game and wow is the time hating of content. All content shouldn‚Äôt be available at launch but they make it so you have to spend weeks for trivial quests and rewards. People don‚Äôt like that and it shows.
---
I'd say it's all about the person streaming. If the personality is nice and entertaining it doesn't matter what the stremable content is.
---
If ignoring that, as a WvW player I would probably watch some self made builds in action demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses in various WvW situations. There's plenty of interesting non-meta builds that are something else than just pressing 123 when called. For example Revenant Herald's tablet explosion. No one ever expects that and it can easily knock off people from cannons, burning oils, interrupt siege disablers or just keeping anyone permanently off from siege safely from range.
---
It's good design in a game that needs people in zones so other people coming through can get stuff they need more easily.  Other games have no reason to go back into  the open world and their worlds are dead. To me, that's bad design. Much worse than this design.  
---
So if they're both bad designs, I prefer this bad design to that bad design...but I don't think this is bad design personally.
---
None of the dumb people got fired. They are all still there.
---
Should I really avoid crafting ascended berserker armor? I've read in the tanetris ascended guide that it's really expensive and in most cases not worth it, but I've played for months and have never get dropped an ascended armor piece of any kind. I crafted full zerk armor for my thief for fractals, but I'm not sure if I should do the same for my other 4 chars or just stick to exotic. 
---
What about viper?
---
He wrote a very poorly worded version of "Gay raiders will love this."
---
You responded using the word "Gay" as some kind of insult like a moron.
---
&gt;Turn down your ego meters and go do your daily WB run, your reasoning is just as dumb as their difficulty.
---
What the fuck are you even on about?
---
I‚Äôm just kind of astonished. WoW was 8 years old when GW2 came out. It was 6 years old when all of the heavy news and development blogs about GW2 started getting pumped out. I already felt like WoW was ancient at that time, and my time with it was done.  (I‚Äôm super looking forward to classic though!)  But GW2 doesn‚Äôt feel nearly as old to me at this stage, and I don‚Äôt feel like my time with it is done. I think that‚Äôs most likely due to how casually I‚Äôve played it compared to WoW.
---
Haven't reported it yet but will now. Was a bug 7 months ago that caused me to drop the game for awhile. Was hoping something might have been found to fix it. Just started playing again today. Ty for the Reply
---
Unfamiliar with terminology, what is downstate cucks?
---
I would say that Signet of Restoration works better for me in a controlled environment like Raid were you have more constant damage (the aura) and also some constant healing source and to help me not interrupt a rotation. In Open World I tend to favor the Glyph for the big "oh shit" button in case I fucked up because I feel that interrupting the rotation is not really an issue there and the damage sources feel less "controlled" (I can control not being hit by boss X that I know well but a bit less for a pack of trash with more random patterns).
---
For Fire I would put the general CD reduction since Sw2 Fire is very very good, the Fury generation when blasting and the general amount of Power bonuses. When I use it in Open World it mostly to go for meta-events or HP tours with a couple of people, for general story I will often default to Tempest. With that in mind it's why I use Fire most of the time but for more solo play Arcane is probably a very good pick with Weaver and Tempest.
---
On bosses Weakness will do a bit of breakbar damage but not much so for bosses the Vitality would be a net gain from Weakness (on enemies without a breakbar Weakness would probably win).
---
too lazy or too smart ! I don't remember if makeover kits were already in the game on release date... it's been a while . Hard to remember.
---
I once got 4 characters restored so yeah, probably
---
I tried the 60fps limit trick but didn't work for me. I was kinda skeptical it would since when i first encountered this bug when the patch came out. My computer could barely hit 30fps. Built a new machine this past weekend and encountered the same bug. But i gave it a shot and still got dc'd. Thank you for the reply though.
---
jUsT cLoSe ThE dIsTaNcE.
---
Did you have to state the name of the character or do they have sort of a history of characters you‚Äôve deleted?
---
Oh boy...  Can't wait to get my lvl 70 scroll that I can't use because all my character slots are full.
---
This. So much this. People nowadays do not realize how bad it was back in 2012. "Back in my days", you had to grind fractals for 10 days to be able to afford a single ascended ring(20 for 2 rings). The chance of it dropping was extremely low. There were no daily fractal chests that gave you a chance of ascended stuff dropping. There were no daily rewards either, not even Laurels. Exotics dropping was a rare enough occurrence, nobody had 300 Magic Find like nowadays. People literally equipped Magic Find gear(which was a stat like Power and Precision) to get better loot. There were not even lootbags from champions, no unidentified gear either. And there were Transmutation Stones, not charges. No wardrobe either to store your skins.
---
I still hate they are tied to characters and  not the account.
---
People got fired from development teams, especially from development teams on supposed side projects that were being focused on instead of gw2 at the time. I imagine that the gemstore team was mostly unaffected and I'm absolutely positive that the collared shirts at NCSoft that have the power to make a lot of the impactful decisions were unaffected by the layoffs.
---
You weren't gonna watch anyway tho :P 
---
Enjoy your life, attempting to look down on people while overly italicizing your posts.
---
I.... literally said that they're not producing content for the rest of the game.
---
As a raider, I too am unhappy with the release cadence and to some degree, the difficulty of the releases, but if ANet knows one thing, it's how to profit with a no sub-fee business model, and they decided to put the skyscale quest in the game, and even change it due to player frustration once, so maybe leave it as is.
---
Stub your toe
---
A tournament to see who spends the most money on gemstore but right before it ends it bugs out and no one gets anything \\o/ content
---
Well I've made 2 back pieces and 2 weapons, and none of the other weapon skins interest me, so might as well start making armor.
---
Did it keep the /age or was it a freshly restored character with no gear and progress?
---
Aside from the repeated mentioning of his dildo shenannigans, this is probably the first time he has made sense without being drowned in his own overblown vulgarity. Good video.
---
Fine. I will pose the actual question then. Wouldn't it be nice if ANet released trailers and teasers of *this production quality* for their own content? Not just raids, but also for wvw, pvp, open world, *dungeons*, anything?
---
[1.You](https://1.You) sure its not 59% crit chance? Even with all the precise infusions and all trinkets mara I cant go above 62%

2. Weavers use +200 power on kill food
---
I wouldn't have blinked at this collection had it been for a legendary weapon, but given it was for a mount, and we had the Griffon and Beetle mount collection as reference, this one was a shock to the system, especially given they wouldn't discuss the collection before it went live.  Nobody saw this coming.
---
That it also became a precursor requirement (in essence) for the legendary trinket was also a big surprise.
---
"Just take a break"

---
Somehow, no matter how many so-called "tasteful" weapon sets we get, somebody always makes this comment as if we've literally never had one before.
---
There are tons of weapons without blinding particles in the game. Stop acting like they don't exist.
---
It's not confusing at all for anyone who knows what the tournament is about. If it was a trailer for open world collections and story content, it'd make a lot more sense to you. The point is that it shows how good the game looks and how epic the combat can feel, instead of a 2 minute close up of the last boss belly dancing counting as a "trailer"
---
No, she disappears after a while (not re: the speech, but after you've visited the area where she is enough times that every piece of triggered dialogue is exhausted). Once that happens, she leaves and doesn't return for you.
---
Yo I love some Modern Rap (Jpegmafia, milo, open mike). Re-downloading this game rn, would love someone like-minded to play with
---
People bitched and complained that the Griffon was to direct, and a gold purchase. So, Anet made the Skyscale tied to doing stuff ingame.
---
And now people are bitching again.
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
ill take an invite to discord too if possible!
---
How long ago did you delete it?
---
With these info ... were they able to find it ?
---
Skyhammer is 'asura facility', 'capricorn' is 'coastal city' and colisseum is closed and we can't see the surroundings, but the architecture is seen in Vigil and lionguard edifices and krytan buildings.
---
Are we so short on new things to bitch about that now we have to go digging up old things to bitch about?
---
When ANet releases skins, some people go crazy whining that it's a cash grab. Then they release a mount with (perhaps) less potential to sell skins, and they whine anyway!
---
First off, the majority of the game's dedicated and active population (aka those who will most likely buy skins) have their Skyscale already. Second, a lot of players don't mind a long collection or challenge when it comes to obtaining something they want -- or, perhaps more accurately, they *mind* and they'll complain, but it doesn't bother them enough to make them decide to give up on the quest and refuse to get a Skyscale.
---
Second, you need to get your facts straight. It doesn't take 40-50 days unless you're moving at a snail's pace. I realize that some folks with limited playtime *could* take that long, but how people choose to use their time isn't ANet's fault. Do you expect everything in the game to be cut down to something so quick and effortless that even the most casual and slow-paced players can obtain it instantly? I have nothing against casuals -- this is a great game to play at a slow pace with low stress -- but it would be ridiculous to move your game only at the pace of the very slowest players. You don't have to grind it out. You can play at a pretty moderate pace and still have your Skyscale *way* faster than "40 or 50 days".
---
Third... "ya played yaself" -- really? I realize you're trying to sound cool, but that just looks stupid in text form. Try harder.
---
&gt;In other words the Reward Track gives you nothing unless all you wanted was the base skin.
---
Exactly. Why not add another set like that? We already have 2 sets (that I mentioned and you mentioned) for obtaining exotic/ascended weapons. Reward tracks have been highly neglected for a while now. We get festival ones and LS ones.
---
Yes. When you stat swap an item, you won't get the same item back (no sigils or other upgrades will remain, and the skin will be a regular crafted version) but you can stat swap profession rewards and you can trans in back if you want to keep the skin
---
I assumed it was a 7 year old character he's been active on for 7 years. The tone does suggest you are right though.
---
You get them per character, and you also got two last year. They add up. 
---
Assume you have eight 7-year characters (one for each profession). That means you got 16 of these last year, and 16 this year. That's 36 total, which is enough for two wardrobe unlocks, one armor or weapon unlock, a full set of magitech/phoenix/braham's armor, 3 mini claim tickets, 1 mount mini, a permanent finisher, or two hats. 
---
Not bad at all, and that's assuming you don't key farm at all. Every 6th or 7th bday is roughly equal to a week's worth of key farming in terms of statuette acquisition, which is a nice bump.
---
^ This so much, I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve died when I‚Äôve been killed
---
Warclaw.
---
don't get your hopes up. i tried that before and they said something along the lines of they can't because the character is too old and their systems were different back then
---
&gt;+Offical build templates is in sight
---
Nice joke.
---
Piggybacking your thread üò¨
---
I‚Äôm thinking of returning and I‚Äôm guessing there are still armor skins locked behind the dungeons? Skins I would like to collects. 
---
So which class has an easier time soloing dungeons? I don‚Äôt mind a good challenge but don‚Äôt want to play a class that has an impossible time to solo it.
---
I am  pretty new player when it comes to gw2 but not really new in knowing what stats to get and why. Why do you want to cap 100% crit? I calculated effective power and whatnot and at a certain point getting more power instead of precision would give me a better effective power than precision.
---
Is the 100% desirable for the short nature of encounters or crit dependant traits?
---
No, they cannot.
---
i've been soloing story mode dungoens relatively smoothly, but to get the dungeon skins i think u need to do explorable mode, which is much harder than story mode to solo (i believe sometimes impossible due to mechanics). 
---
if ur not too repulsed by pvp u can solo the story mode dungeon easily to unlock its corresponding reward track for pvp, then grind out the dungeon tokens there and exchange them for the armor/weapon you want
---
I wrote this late last night. It is quite possible I failed at reading numbers.
---
I suggested the -10% damage food mostly on the idea of OP being new to weaver. That 10% means a lot when learning a class. Can't use that 200 power when full dead. It is the one to upgrade to though.
---
I also mentioned Eagle Runes over Scholar, as remaining over 90% health as a new weaver, I dont think it'll happen. This adds a ton of precision (125, which is like 8% crit iirc)
---
OP asked for dungeons, and you can't out dps power using condi on a bunch of stuff in dungeons since "object" targets in dungeons never got updated to be valid targets for conditions. OP should just run zeal/virtues/radiance core guard power DPS.
---
Though this isn't the topic at hand, does that work over flame patches or do you need to leave that space free to be able to use Burning Retreat?
---
Who's willing to spend a fuckload of gold for the sword skin, though?
---
Burning Retreat is an evade, so it works over fire and and that carpet aoe field.
---
Yip, I was wondering if the evade duration was long enough to cover the distance that is normally covered by the flames. I guess from your response that it is, thanks!
---
Yes, it is.
---
You never made the "effort" because, let's be honest here, you saw no value in it. Now, that has changed. You see value in it because the 7-year reward(s) piqued your interest.
---
Weave your story and excuses however you wish, but the fact of the matter that this is as sleazy as the ones abusing the kindness of support to receive multiple rewards won't change.
---
Chainsaw = Right hand
---
Boomstick = Left hand.
---
So you need a class that can mainhand sword / offhand pistol.
---
Thief, Mesmer and Holosmith
---
Well I've got news for you pal, you're leading two things right now........Jack and shit. And Jack left town.
---
I played WoW from the launch of BC to BfA so ya I played it a lot. The questing is trivial because you have yo wait till they decide to let you progress. Then at the end of the expansion it‚Äôs all gone and you can do content that took a month in a few days.  Also played Eve from the beginning till about five years ago.  Eve is the ultimate time sink. I have played my share of mmos. I don‚Äôt mind playing for hours but the way wow sets up its content is gated that you know it‚Äôs done that way to string you along instead of making a story seem good.
---
All I see ppl suddenly having a stroke
---
How would the mist vendors help? There are also no exotic HoT stat insignias/ inscriptions that can be traded on the TP if I'm not mistaken. Mordant/ Spearmarshal are the only non-core ones that can be traded (PoF).
---
the memories I guess. I sell them personally
---
Race change please
---
What about it? If your saying that it killed roaming then I agree. But people a
---
What sold me was making my thief into a "gunslinger".
---
&gt; Imo dungeon rewardtracks were a mistake too. It shouldn‚Äôt be possible to unlock every (dungeon) reward literally without entering a dungeon once. Having to play different content is pretty healthy for the game/gamemodes in general.
---
The problem with this is 90% of content is PvE. If you remove dungeon and PvE reward tracks you are left with like 4 reward tracks or something.
---
If rewards were balanced per gamemode, it would make sense. Since they are heavily PvE though, chuking them reward tracks up help pvp players feel rewarded.
---
Temple of the Silent Storm: am i a joke to you?
---
I legitimately can tell if you're serious or not.
---
its not really a fuckton of gold though.  its a decent amount but not too bad compared to some stuff.
---
except to hold the pistol aloft you would need it in the main hand
---
Heroics notary in wvw sells vipers inscription/insignia
---
Exactly same for open world PvE.
---
I basically always just tag then mount up on skyscale and afk till completion.
---
According to the drop rates each box is about 3 levels. And if you check the Ley-Energy Matter Converter, Karmic Converter and a Level 5 Guild Trader every day you can get around 0.683 a day (according to my gw2efficiency going back 60 days). That's much more than 50 levels in 3 years.
---
As someone who mostly plays PvP, I hate that gen 1 legendarys are 95% PvE and 5% WvW.
---
Nobody even has to set foot in PvP.
---
Ah, the recipes, yeah. Core accounts can't access that tab
---
How can I get that logo in the background of the left photo?
---
Shit I forgot to remove those √ó_√ó
---
Gw2skills + mobile = bad.
---
Ye must have taken so much effort at least 2h for junior dev ?
---
And even if there is some flash, they tend to look in place lore-wise. Everyone just sees so many legendaries they forget about all these sets that ANet releases that aren't eyesores. Newsflash: it's not the developer, it's the players.
---
The mistforged stuff isn't too had once you've got the rank. It doesn't require crafts tokens for this set. Whereas the equivalent pvp it does
---
Yeah, how about I explore PVE maps and my PvP rank points go up as I uncover POIs?  Stupid.  If you want something from another mode, then go earn it through that mode.  Everything is as it should be.
---
Yeah but thats another issue on its own, not related to the quality of the game and the streamers. The lack of support from Anet, or rather, the lack of acknowledgement is certainly an issue and has been pointed out by many for some years now. Their strange inability and disconnect with the Twitch community is odd given how much influence having a game in the top 20 is.
---
Ohh I should go check on that. Although my method for dye selection is to find a dye that looks good on whatever character I'm currently playing - Google dye to find out if it's in any dye pack I currently own (I've got a load of birthday dye packs that I can break into at need) - open birthday dye pack.
---
Sadly there are a LOT of awesome colours in the packs that should be in the new birthday box, and I'm only getting 2 this year :(
---
Also is it just me or are there no great green dyes?
---
Mate, using  common sense in relation to PvP on this sub is only gonna get you downvoted.
---
Ele is a decent choice.
---
I know you're just being a smartass. Not that my edgy bullshit warranted much more. But I do want to use the moment to explain to any potential future reader, that a cash shop can and will not keep a game alive. That's being carried by the game itself. Cash shops just pay the bills and, if done right, support what's already there instead of murdering it with unholy greed (looking at you, EA/SW:TOR). At least in case of B2P or F2P models. Let's not talk about subs, too many games with subs AND cash shops.

&gt;## Structured Player vs. Player
---
&gt;A new 2v2 map, Auric Span, has been added to custom arenas. Similar to Hall of the Mists and Asura Arena, at the end of match time, healing and stealth will be disabled. Damaging areas will start to form on the map, shrinking the playable space.
---

You're asking me to look through 2 years of AMAs for a single comment about the story of the gods not being finished. I just spent about 30 minutes and I'm not even halfway through the first one, I'm gonna call it and say you'll just have to trust me that I read it from an anet dev.
---
Sadly I can‚Äôt see it either. 
---
Especially since everything except living story feels kinda neglected. 
---
Hopefully the 30th will change everything. haha
---
* The Customize window now has a search bar to filter options by name.
---
* Options on the right side of the Customize window are now sorted alphabetically.
---
* Upgrades in shared inventory slots can now be used in the Customize window.
---
* The Customize window no longer prompts for confirmation unless a slotted upgrade is about to be destroyed.
---
Oh boy they actually listentened!
---
Especially after it was clear you need 250 each those who want the mount could have already started in small steps instead of complaining 50 days later.
---
&gt;Fixed a bug that prevented merged soulbeasts from re-merging automatically when dismounting.
---
yaaaassss
---
&gt; The Customize window now has a search bar to filter options by name.
---
&gt; Options on the right side of the Customize window are now sorted alphabetically.
---
Kudos to you, Arenanet.
---
I really wish some of these weapons sets would be out as skins as well, seeing as I don't need the ascended weapons at this point.
---
Kind of a surprise change, I must say.  I get they want to incentivize commanders to keep an open tag, but it unnecessarily rewards those who were going to run public anyways, and while it doesn't really punish anyone for running hidden, it does suck to think they are losing out on 2 extra pips.
---
Just an odd choice imo.
---
Well, that's in the patch now, so we'll see.
---
The only change noted in the patch notes is that public tags in WvW gain more pips.
---
More boring than the Weapons Test Engineer?  Well, I guess he died so fast there wasn't time for him to be boring.
---
And besides that, he just got changed too.
---
Lolllllllll
---
Excuse me, solid is much more boring
---
At home
---
Sipping nasty scourge water
---
watching perma stealth gvg
---
Arenanet call
---
"no shattered aegis buff blyat"
---
no
---
Anyone have screenshots of the new items and dyes?
---
Ah, I see where you are going now.
---
So there is no emote or action where only the left arm is raised?
---
So 20 tags every map ...
---
It was only ever disabled in PvP. The patch note is just repeating what [the forum post on the 2nd](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/83741/chaotic-interruption-temporarily-disabled-in-pvp%7C) already said.
---
Ye, I see. xD
---
"A new 2v2 map, Auric Span, has been added to CUSTOM ARENAS ONLY" #feelsbad #cryface #begforqueue
---
The only stats released after HoT that core players can acquire are Marauder (Svaaard) and Crusader (Ossa).
---
OSRS is the least interesting MMO to play let alone watch, AFKing in front of a tree for 50 hours so you can AFK firemaking isn't very exciting for either side
---
It may be that.
---
The first hit downs almost every single class in pvp. Only necro or bunkers will have more than 20k hp. So no, you can't dodge when down.
---
You need 5 people in squad for the commander to get extra pips.
---
But you could run 8 squads of 6 players rather than 1 squad of 50.
---
It is 10 people in squad, you can see it in game at the reward legend.
---
The new outfit is INSANE.
---
Why, Arenanet, _why_? You were so close to developing a great new system. Want to run a squad for just your own guild? Well, you can switch the squad to private instead of running around with a 'public' tag that isn't!
---
But now commanders are encouraged to maintain the status quo. Why use a private squad when I could use a 'public' squad and enjoy the +3 pips? There's practically no point to running a private squad now.
---
It seems the Vouchers (Backpack/Glider and Outfit) have been updated in general, not only the Wings of Love change. The Shrine Guardian outfit is now available for example, as well as the Legion Jetpack Backpack/Glider.
---
Well it was no secret anet did character birthdays when gw2 released.
---
5 including or not including the commander?
---
If only they would if it's about skill changes... *wipes a tear*
---
Anyone have pictures of the outfit or the lightbinder items for those of us at work?
---
I totally read Magneton. Been playing way too much Let's Go lately.
---
All of my T4 fractals characters have Exotic quality underwater weapons (obv with no infusions)
---
2 of my T4 fractal characters have ascended breathers, but both have swim speed, not agony resistance infusions.
---
There is no way this boss could be less trivial, and while I don't subscribe to this notion that things must be made harder because reasons, I think for this one it's justified.
---
Solid Ocean at least has the potential to fail.  I have never failed, or even been downed vs. Jelly.
---
I think it's designed well.  At a moment's notice, I can't think of a better way of how they did it.
---
Nobody owes you to prove anything. You can either accept the information or live in ignorance, that is your choice, not the person giving you the information. Do you expect people to bookmark every piece of information regarding the game? don't be ridiculous.
---
I also distinctly remember them saying that the Gods storyline is not finished yet. No, I didn't bookmark it when I read it.
---
You are allowed to discuss all aspects, both positive and negative, about the new game mode. Please do at least have something in your thread body to start discussion.
---
[Does not work.](https://i.imgur.com/zlECSv5.png)
---
Thanks!
---
I'm using Triumphant Faceguard, Houndskin Mantle, Ardent Glorious Brigandine, Heritage Armguards, Carapace Leggings, Bladed Boots. Medium armor
---
Right click a piece of gear, and an option should pop up that says "customize"
---
Click on that to open the customize window. Here, you can swap out any available stats/upgrade that are available to that weapon.
---
It's only actually useful on gear that can be regularly swapped around, but it's still available to look at if you want to swap out things like runes or sigils that you have in your inventory
---
we Assassin's Creed Unity now
---
looks like ass compared to the new gemstore sword.  How unexpected...
---
I didn't play GW1. I got into GW2 when my friend introduced to me the game in beta. To this day I haven't played GW1, although I should.
---
I understand that you care a lot about this but people come to this game from different backgroups and times from others. I was lucky to find this game and play in beta/first year. Many people haven't. Many people haven't played the original MMO.
---
Makes sense to me. Since they probably want people to try it out first and have no system in place for a queue. Rewards, ranking, etc.
---
That's fair, though they could just idle wvw for more gifts and afk pvp for the maps?
---
Finally some new orange colors!
---
The +3 pips is for the commander only. So if you want a private squad now you can have it. The +3 pips is to stop EVERYONE from running invisible squads and making the gamemode feel even more dead.
---
hmm why does this remind me of shining sword breaker from crush gear :\\
---
How cool would that be as a new light set. No money for ANet
---
Yeah lets waste all "ANET PVP Resources" for maps that no one is going to play... Increadible job! -.-
---
Both are great. Destroyer orange dyes stuff a much more matte orange while searing dyes things with more contrast and shinyness.
---
Half of the stuff is per account, the other half is per character
---
Alas, it doesn't. Would've been a great feature to have.
---
The thing is Anet can and that video posted the other day, League in slow motion, was a perfect showcase of that.
---
Maybe it was too much work for a gem store skin? But tbh, I would have been more sold on these things if they had spread out the swords, even if it means less swords.
---
I just can't unsee the wings.
---
OMG THAY OUTFIT I'M CRYING
---
No, but i also don't provide totally unsubstantiated answers to a question and then get defensive when asked for a source.
---
Exactly this.  Continually improving features like this is the best thing they can do.
---
Not actually. In PvP panel you can change more than that, you an change all trinkets, runes from the whole armor set at once and I believe weapon sigils as well.
---
The focus looks like a pretty crazy cool weapon on Charr; like it has extra claws? Also the torch is huuuuge, unexpected. (I've only previewed them on Charr so far).
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
like 90% of armors/outfits,it looks good until you are in combat.
---
That Knife Tail Gang Hunting Bond is......interesting
---
another victim of the usual pvp hate instant downvotes on reddit -.-
---
nice match, sad the end was missing.
---
How do you skip PvP, do shards of glory come from something else besides PvP?  Same thing with stablizing matrices - I thought only fractals gave those...  Am I just reading what you said wrong?  You said pvp and pve can be skipped, and I am wondering how.
---
Knife Tail Gang Hunting Bond sounds interesting. Remains to be seen how it works exactly though. Is it permanent, temporary, consumable, etc.
---
Once again, no dashing suits for chicks.  Is it too much for me to look badass without a froppish fabric mess?  Are PANTS too much to ask for?
---
What the actual fuck?
---
&gt; Commanders who choose to keep their squad public will now get an extra 3 pips per tick.
---
But, why?
---
You‚Äôre the one who keeps replying. I merely stated that many players will have 5 characters birthdays coming up and then gave the reason why. 
---
What I said is true.
---
&gt; Recovered goods will always unlock something from the Black Lion Trading Company in your wardrobe‚Äîweapons, exclusive dye colors, even mounts!
---
yeah sounds too good to be true, what are the common drops?
---
Oh. New event :D
---
Looks great, too bad it's gemstore.
---
&gt;Quality of life 
---
&gt; Enable Anti-addiction Reminders
---

---
&gt; Knife Tail Gang
---
Oh, wow, Path of Exile league. Nice.
---
Thanks for sharing! Warband looks pretty sweet, I'm a fan of warm yellows/browns/oranges
---
I guess this is their new way of getting around lootbox regulations.
---
they said few times already that they balance game with 5vs5 in mind, and because of it there wont ever be 2vs2 queue
---
Yeah I‚Äôm concerned but intrigued.
---
What does invisible tag have to do with spying?
---
Looks gorgeous, shame it's an outfit otherwise I'd buy it.
---
Like the other 2v2 maps that have existed in the game for years?
---
looks pretty [meh](https://i.gyazo.com/28ea266476ac0b073337293b5a06da1d.mp4). honestly, bough just for [gliding](https://i.gyazo.com/b8ae94531a738b9b80d7c5ad21ec3fc3.mp4). How the hell backpack dying is still not avaible in 2019... Make it the same as gliders, not every but some that have big easily changable color parts. bs at its best.
---
Knife Tail Gang Board sounds potentially expensive.  xD
---
Interested to see the Champion Rush event though I guess.
---
I mean this was really obvious, I have no idea why people were expecting a queue.
---
Tbh I wonder why they made a new mechanic instead of, you know, adjusting the existing ones so they can't be ignored as easily.
---
Do you know what the anniversary dye pack contains?
---
Imagine being this worked up over someone trying to get a birthday gift in game.
---
Shine on you crazy Diamond.
---
My guess: 150 gems single use, find a mob and kill it, get the equivalent of 1 roll from BLC.
---
Too busy for my taste.
---
These look dumb and uninspired, might as well just repackage Hero's weapons. WvW deserves something more signature than another bulky throwaway set.
---
Question - I haven't logged in much since finishing the last LW story, and when I logged in a couple of days ago there'd been a gear reset. Can someone tell me why this happened?
---
Just want to know if it'll have nerfed my build. Did some gear combination go away or something?
---
GW1 handled presents exactly like this, and also GW2 has handled presents like this since the first birthday. Ignorance isn't really a viable argument here. If you're deleting characters constnslty, especially after the first birthday comes and goes, that's a choice you made.
---
And I don't understand the argument about new players. No, they don't get these rewards, they get the older rewards. Why shouldn't they? They have to wait the same length of time as we all did to get their presents.
---
First of all, that wasn't me, you do realize I am not the same person? Second of all, again, really think how ridiculous what you want is. You want that person to look through *all the AMAs for your sake instead of you doing that yourself*. You asked that question, you want that information why should they do it? Anything they said, even a simple "they said in an AMA, I don't remember which, that the Gods storyline isn't fully done" is a courtesy extended to you and is already helpful, because you can take that information and research it further by actually doing what you instead ask of them.
---
What I am saying is, it's up to you to decide what to do with this, frankly it matters to nobody in the world but you. I just want to point out the arrogance with which you replied to them.
---
Basically a Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlock for gemstore items only
---
Definitely not a fan personally, but good that the option is there for people who want more mundane looking stuff.
---
Just 5k gems. ;) (no, I dont know for real)
---
\&gt; hit twice  
---
\&gt;muh stealth  
---
lol k, dodge roll when you see the big neon green "WATCH OUT!" sign next time
---
‚ÄúWhile bonded‚Äù the description says. It‚Äôs a buff.
---
I'm not much for WvW, but many small stacks attacking something sounds much more interesting than one big stack to me, particularly if there's some degree of coordination between them. It may amount to nothing in the long term, but it could also pull the meta in a new, and possibly more interesting, direction.
---
They're another bulky boring set, waste of opportunity to make something signature for these game modes.
---
I didnt say there is NO champions. Its just normal mobs created by event, never become champions.
---
Wow the return of the old Queensdale champ train.
---
Hey, the warning is something at least.
---
I would guess Siren's Landing and Thunderhead Peaks are excluded too, even though they aren't mentioned.  Though perhaps champions are rare enough in those two zones that they don't feel such an exclusion is necessary?
---
Siren's Landing only has a handful of champions outside of the restoring power events, while Thunderhead Peaks has even less, just the ones spawning in the metas and a couple others related to the supply transport.
---
Nope, you can buy them right off the bat if you have the currencies
---
yeah wow what a pvp update, content on mass!
---
Yay, finally. \o/
---
Yeah it's really telling if you've ever had a DPS meter enabled in open world. When some players are worth 10-20 others things are not going to go well.
---
so many dont really need it unfortunally.
---
pretty interactive gameplay ;))
---
Applies blind to nearby foes and players.
---
they are okay, we had worse
---
Lightbinder blades : Erza Scarlet cosplay !
---
its consumable
---
Thank you! Looks dope
---
Thanks, now I remember few MMO's that have this feature.
---
I'm not really making an argument? I'm saying that having a lot of 7 year olds isn't the norm. That this subreddit as a demograph has more of the hardcore playerbase. That my personal experiences with people who play this game is more of my expectation of the regular playerbase.
---
Also, I have never played GW1. I should. But ignorance about something in a game I never played or that I should've known just because I played the sequel, that does not sound or seem right. Apologies for upsetting you, I love this game too. I'll just stop talking and contributing my opinions as a player from GW2's beginnings.
---
I have a hunch this kit won't be part of the 7th birthday gift. Searing is gonna be the new 750+g dye. Because it's killer. Though Warband and Tribune are also nice... would love to see how they dye the "shiny" metal armor like the legendary set and the newer LS sets and prestige PvP/WvW sets.
---
One more question , are skin unlocks account wide?
---
Probably the new PvP map.
---
Luckily it seems like a toggle.
---
they are not wvw exculsive tho, i think they were meant for pvp and wvw just got them too so we have a second way to get it
---
Try one of the organised maps. If you are on NA server there is usually at least one map during the evening/late night (PT) on weekdays and almost 24h during weekends.
---
There are no problems with DPS if we have enough people (7-8 per boss). Lack of cooperation and poor communication are the main reasons for gold failures. We still end up with silver in the majority of these cases.
---
I hope that it is something wrong with your settings. I looked pretty nice on a preview, but if it is this ingame, then I'm not buying it.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-V2XY7etH8
---
Well heck.  Not as useful a field as it could be then. 
---
Thank you kindly for doing the screenshot!
---
Quite a few of them do it automatically. Gets annoying after a while, luckily it seems like a toggle here.
---
looks rly good
---
they look like i dont want to spend my 29k wvw tickets on.
---
Still haven't bough new gw2 dress ,wtf??
---
You mean off?
---
I think its like this to tie in with the anniversary if the black lion chest gets an anniversary update I think these could be a way of put all gemstore items to celebrate 7 years and give everyone a chance to win something.
---
So i dont understand your point. How many YEARS do they need to test 2vs2 mode ?
---
Why are you so upset about it?
---
Why do the Charr Dye vials have heart eyes?
---
Anyone with an asura wanna share the preview for it?
---
Only problem, those aren't champs anymore.
---
That bright orange is really.... bright.
---
I want it.
---
It could cost tons of man power/resource to dig out backup tapes laying somewhere and sort out your account for what? BUT it also could be just some keystrokes away(store backup in cloud?)
---
-
---
Never hurt to try though.
---
Ah sh*t, here we go again. Idk what's worse, that firecracker dragon glider they recently released from dragon bash or... or this equally blinding sunbeam of doom.
---
It's balanced for people who don't know what the buttons do on their underwater skills.
---
Wonder what this could hint at...
---
Nie give us option to look for STATS and I can die happy.
---
Like GW1.
---
Honestly, I'm a bit lazy myself. But even using a farming Tempest build and using 5 skills out of cooldown from a range (not effort needed for that) I'm usually the 2nd or 3rd highest DPS in the zerg sitting at a mere 7k/s.
---
The only time I got gold in the Boss Blitz event, it was with a smaller squad (4-6 people per boss) and everyone was actually trying.
---
Using LFG is kind of a trade off where you'll risk lots of those lazy players swarming to your instance and scaling up the boss without really adding any help.
---
I was happy thinking I could finally customize my gear after hearing there was a search bar added to the customization section, but nope, the game just crashes when I click on "customize".
---

&gt; Auric Span

&gt; In overtime, healing and stealth are disabled and the map will slowly be covered by deadly fog.
---
Is... is this like Battle Royale?
---
BLOOM ALL THE WAY UP
---
It's there for fun and for player to test it, until they introduce regular 2v2 tournaments.
---
Ranged queue will be only for 5v5 conquest for now.
---
aawww nice and so sweet
---
"If there was no incentive to run a public tag, then everyone would run private tags"
---
The incentive run a public tag is to get people to join your squad and follow the commander.  Pugmanders I run with regularly post in /m for people to join and the discord address.  
---
If you run hidden tag nobody can join your squad.
---
I agree with the OP, they just needed to add this feature with no additional incentives.
---
Alt accounts will join other servers and their squads in order to track commanders.
---
For Boss Blitz, CC is more problematic than DPS, at least in my experience. Many people do not manage their cooldowns right and some players do not even know which skills have CC effect.
---
I hope this fixes the bug with pet getting stuck in a stowed state after mount engages that has plagued me every day I've played ranger since the release of Path of Fire.
---
Yeah, was annoying there. Luckily it seems like a toggle now.
---
That knife tail gang is really crossing the line of cosmetic only gemstone imo.  This is gameplay development (however small)  that was programmed in and sold to us.
---
It's not just a simple drop added to a table.  This is a genuine hunt mechanic that could be in the game elsewhere.
---
Wouldn't this be making server spying harder, though, because they can't join a squad that they can't see?
---
Why have Champion Marks if the only think they can be redeemed for is Bonus Boxes of Goods?  Why not just have the champion kill reward the box of goods?
---
WE ARE ALL DOOMED!!! It was hilarious!
---
"resistance bars" -&gt; defiance bars
---
I was kinda worried when I first read this since I didn't do Boss Blitz this year, implying some sort of resistance on boss to make condis useless.
---
https://imgur.com/a/E4wkPIr
---
It's been a while since I did the calculations, and I must have done them completely wrong. I remember I was basing it off the total wxp based on the number of drops themselves, not the drops per container. Either way it is way less than 3 levels per box like you said (and I've edited my original comment).
---
I have 112 or so and am waiting to 150 or so so I can get some proper research in myself.
---
Ye wish they would make us Armor of that quality
---
Thunderhead Peaks would've have to be an accident too. Seems weird.
---
Upvoted so it feelslessbadman
---
The weapon set is kinda meh for me.  I think the Hero's Weapons set has some of the nicest, more realistic weapon models in the game, with the Greatsword and Longsword being two of my favorite skins of all time.
---
These seem similar to the Hero collection, only less so?  The shield is quite nice, but the rest seem rather plain to me.  Maybe in game they will look better.
---
No worries, I need my tickets for Leg armor anyways lol
---
Yes, godless looks good. The top ones are borderline eye cancer but the moire subtle ones are nice.
---
I mean account age. To get the account bound stuff, you have a character of age.
---
Maybe it will more then one mark for box of goods.
---
We anime now confirmed.
---
I mean 2v2 is a great format imo. It‚Äôs just really odd there‚Äôs no matchmaking for it, who knows it‚Äôs coming.  
---
I personally had great memories from WoW Arena 2v2 during WotLK for example.
---
I could never save that much to do a proper research bomb myself, the daily is too tempting to collect, so good luck obtaining your data! ;)
---
actually yes, i thought it was there. anyway we won with 10 points difference ;)
---
This continuous festival event festival event spam is leaving some content that was already scarcely populated almost completely empty. It's getting quite annoying IMO.
---
I‚Äôd be really surprised if they wouldn‚Äôt announce 2v2 matchmaking 30th of august
---
Thanks for update!! Absolutley love this game, Cant wait for the new content HYYYPEDü•∞üòã
---
I was just thinking they look like cosplay props, except for the hammer for some reason. I think the large "metallic" surfaces don't really pass as such.
---
It's the Noble Courtier and the Lightbinder Blades backpack/gilder set. You can dye the glider, but not the backpack.
---
Also if you equip a shield, you can make some sort of "releasing" style (there is no special effect).
---
Not really a fan of most of the "winged" pack pieces, but this one is indeed interesting.
---
And yeah, anyone wanting to pull off a Byakuya Kuchiki cosplay now has an easier time.
---
&gt; Because why on earth would Anet devote resources to making THREE maps (seriously, I had no idea the 2nd one existed until now.) only to throw them into the dumpster that is custom games. 
---
After 7 years  you should know already anet is low IQ company.
---
Oh hot mama, I want at least 3 of these. Maybe 5.
---
Lots of guilds/players are disbanding or taking breaks until the announcement at the end of the month. If WvW doesn't get some attention, I'd expect population to drop further.
---
It‚Äôs mothra!!!!
---
Love those!
---
So why you justify them? Whole PVP community waiting for new content to play and ANET waste all resources for maps that are useless... GOOD JOB!
---
why does that nightshade skin come back just as i spend 1300 on my cats vet bills üò≠
---
Legendary item stats are locked to the expansions you own. To select viper you need hot, to select harrier you need pof.
---
I don't have 1 Charr character, don't like them as a race really, but I want to go to their homeland and make them more a part of the story so badly. I hope we're headed north / northeast for some Charr/Norn stuff.
---
Wait, that's an actual backpack skin as well, and the sword skin matches the glider/backpack skin?
---
Goddamn it. I don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it.
---
- Link the game .exe
---
- Add parameter -repair in the target adress
---
- Run that linked .exe
---
- Don't tab out of the repair client (it doesn't like running in the background)
---
Right!
---
So I went with Air 3/2/1 | Arcane 2/3/1 | Weaver 1/2/3
---
Went with Assassin‚Äôs Head/Chest/Legs + Weapons rest Zerk for hitting 70% Crit. Sigil of Accuracy + Energy, Runes of Vampirism (seems really strong with lots of trash mobs) and power infusions. I‚Äôm using the standard food raid guides suggest.
---
I took Glyph/Fate/Stone/Weave self as my utilities.
---
Looks good for an open world build?
---
That's really cool! I'm getting into GW1 to get more Hall of Monuments stuff and one thing that's really cool in there is that it tells you "you've been playing for X hours, please take a break"
---
I never do, but still!
---
It wasn't a nerf, fear not.
---
Previously, when you obtained an item that let you select stats, the stats you could select were limited to the area the item was from.  Core Tyria items only let you select Core Tyria stats, Heart of Thorns items let you select Heart of Thorns stats (sometimes, some like Bladed Armour only let you pick Core Tyria stats), etc.
---
Now, with the change, items that let you select stats (unless it's a very limited number, like specialization weapons) let you pick any stats your account has access to based on the expansions you own.  So your Bitterfrost trinkets can pick Path of Fire stats like Grieving and Harrier now when they couldn't before, or you can pick Diviner's or Viper's on your Path of Fire trinkets/backpacks.  To handle this change, all stat-selectable items have been reverted to unselected stats, so you can freely change them.
---
Enjoy your new freedom!
---
Super saiya-jin charr brighter than the sun riding a meteor says hi. That outfit and glider actually tones it down...
---
Each maps has to be tested, just in case there's things like spots that let players fall through, or get stuck after using shadowstep skills.
---
Now, those problems getting fixed, that's another beast altogether.
---
The worst offenders imo are the shield and axe, especially the axe. I truly wonder how much dev time was put into these weapons compared to gemstore items. There really shouldn't be such a gulf between the two just because one pays and one doesn't.
---
Only if they have 5 members in their squad right? Will take a while before everyone figures that out though.
---
Now that I've seen images, I completely agree.  Now we just have to wait for the outrage mob.
---
I would get these is the blades were smaller and they "deployed" like the glider when you got into combat. They just look sort of sad.
---
well i tested it in pve and didn't do anything there :)
---
when it was new, people delt less damage.  You had to lure the jelly to one of the lightning orbs which would stun it and make it take more damage for a few sec.  This was pretty much required.  But now that everyone deals like 50% more dmg, we can just auto-attack it and win instead of strategy.
---
The difference between gold and silver is:
---
 - 20 tokens
---
 - 0-10 gauntlet tickets (0-2.5s )
---
 - 2 champion bags
---
 - 1 green gear
---
 - 1 yellow gear
---
Silver is done pretty much effortlessly by pugs. Tryharding is a waste of time. This whole event isn't really worthwhile after you're done with your achievements (you get more g/h flipping wood on TP).
---
That dress üòç
---
You could always run de-tagged. Many guilds have been doing this for years and years already. But it's nice to not have to do cat tag shenanigans anymore.
---
The other 2 2v2 maps already were like this also. It's so you can't just bunker vs bunker and stretch out matches forever. You already get 1v1 fights in 5v5 where people just do not die at all.
---
I mean, I would imagine that any notable changes would take more than an hour and a half to catch on, so let's not assume nothing will change just yet. You're probably right, but I can dream, darn it.
---
Do you even know what we are talking about ? All pvp players are waiting for new gamemode. We didnt get anything since march 2015. And you still talking about testing? That they need more time? WTF men....
---
I'd be happy with quite a considerable gem price if it was a permanent account unlock. I like to support the game and normally do this with deluxe expansion packages or occasional purchases from the gem store. As few cosmetics have appealed to me recently and LS5 could potentially be free, this would be a nice thing to put some money towards.
---
see if you can alt-tab or hit window key?
---
It's still weird, since Siren's Reef and Thunderhead Peaks are also in Central Tyria, even if they're not accessible via map transition portal. 
---
It'd be just as confusing if SR and TP are excluded without being mentioned.
---
I have not deleted any characters. I do not know where you are getting this from. As soon as I learned the importance of it, I made additional characters. I now have 19. 
---
I am talking about my experiences with people IRL that also play the game. My perspective on it from my friends and myself. I am not saying that I should get a higher year present for a lower age. I brought up lower aged characters/players as a point that it's outside the norm to have that many. That even the people that did play from the beginning, it's rare that they have 5+ 7 years. That this is a vocal minority. It seems like everyone in this particular thread has multiple 7 years. Good for them, honestly. I wish I had done that. But this is a vocal and concentrated minority. If you go and talk to people in game, you will find there will not be as many. I was offering a perspective in the middle, between what my impression of the regular playerbase is/will get versus the hardened pros here.
---
I'm getting serious renaissance vibes from that outfit. Definitely one of my favorites.
---
Searing is already 150g.
---
That is unfortunate. :(
---
At least you have a answer now.
---
And that's a interesting piece of info I'll keep that in mind when talking about character recovery.
---
It's very good for pugging metas like Leyline Anomaly where you want a tag for killing coas, but you don't want the zerg to follow you.
---
Yeah... IDK what they're talking about, but it's actually the opposite of what they're saying
---
I see more RIBA squads than festival (there's been no gold blitz in my lfg for a week).  I've never seen DF fail its meta, and people even do the metas in sandswept, which is about the deadest s4 map.  Maybe you're in off-hours?
---
This makes me want to buildcraft the best solo champ build. 
---
Also, I want that angry chest tonic, so let's get to it, peeps.
---
That Knife Tail Gang Hunting Bond sounds like black lion chest and wardrobe unlock had a baby
---
What you believe is your perrogative. Although it's an odd thing to say when i never once suggested most people have five characters that old but that many players who started that early made 5 characters.
---
To go one further, **some** GW1 vets specifically told early access and launch newcomers about the presents and suggested they use up all their slots, There were even threads about it on various communities. So that many included some people who never played GW1.
---
&gt;If you didn't want to talk about it, why did you even reply to me? I have only been responding due to you responding.
---
There's a difference between a conversation and someone misinterpreting what you said so they can continue to dissagree with the falsehood.
---
That's most likely the case. There are so maps where you can farm champions extremely quickly, especially fast compared to world bosses or meta events.
---
Well yes, but at the same time it makes spying more necessary than before.
---
It's giving me Dragon Age Inquisition vibes gnfdjlknd must buy fnbdslfnj
---
Must be a timing thing. I haven't had problems completing Dragonfall maps over the last two months, even with all the events. The regular reset meta zergs, and infusion zergs are still alive and active, sometimes with multiple groups running.
---
...how? From the other server's perspective, nothing has changed.
---
Or do you mean, you can't simply walk into a map as a spy and see where the commanders are, you need to actually join the squad, that spying will be more difficult than before? Because that appears to be the opposite of what you're saying.
---
Pin Sniping Countermeasures - engage!
---
omg, I'm at work right now. Is anyone able to show me how goofy af male Norn look in this outfit? lol
---
That too...there's too many.
---
I'll add to this:
---
When fighting Sprac, either bring Stability or learn to dodge his CC teleport. It's very telegraphed and he does it at the same interval every time.
---
Also **KILL THE HEALING TURRET**
---
Those are some tasty grays and gaudy oranges.
---
&gt; Defeated players will be revived after the Jade Maw is successfully defeated.
---
Such a odd change, is this now the only fractal to auto res dead players when its defeated? I wonder if they will keep this change or add it to other fractals. Personally I think its a bit silly, you died but the boss is dead so you can checkpoint or the team can res you.
---
Did I miss the hammer pic?
---
Squads that hide tag, generally do not to reduce numbers. Why would they let randoms in squad?
---
Problem: Custom arenas are pricey and don't count for a chunk of dailies anymore, and they cap track progress.  If I can't get matches played or won achieve...why am I going to use a novelty map?  I'm not getting anything from it except a little sightseeing for no rewards.  Custom arenas used to be a cool place for noobs to not clog the queues while they did dailies and figured stuff out.
---
Now they're an overpriced closet.
---
Vampi is a very safe option and I probably would have gone for Strength Runes or Pack/Firework (no modifiers but some good stats and pulsing boons on those 2) as a more offensive alternative.
---
Energy makes me feel that now the Vigor from arcane might be a bit overkill :p
---
My default Open World food (waaaaay more cheap than the raid food) is a [Preci + Life Steal on crit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scoop_of_Mintberry_Swirl_Ice_Cream) food which feels very nice in complement with the rest.
---
[Bountiful Power](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bountiful_Power) might be better in Arcane Grandmaster to get some benefit of your Arcane boons.
---
For the Elite I would say that Weave Self or FGS are up to debate depending on the situation (mostly FGS could be nice for quick escape :p).
---
I fell that the Stone Stance is a bit overkill on this an it Lightning Flash, Signet of Fire or Arcane Blast/Wave (to blast your Fire Fields and have some instant casts) but you can always swap it out when you feel that you don't use it that much.
---
&gt; That even the people that did play from the beginning, it's rare that they have 5+ 7 years.
---
Then they made the choice, at some point, to delete characters. If they did that after the first birthday (read: if they're hitting less than their 6th birthday right now), then they did it knowing full well that birthdays were character linked. I don't see why they're whining about their decision and I don't see why I should have sympathy for them. Again, for the last time, none of this is a surprise or hidden information. The best case scenario you can reasonably present is that they deleted characters for that first year. 
---
I'm not saying that 7 year characters are the average, what I'm saying is that anyone who has played for 7 years and doesn't have at least a 6 year old character made an informed choice to delete their character at some point.
---
yes, but u need a transmutation charge to apply the skin to an item (you should get plenty from ranked pvp)
---
Aww you two and your usernames just reminded me about how certain I was that we'd defeat the Mordrem Moth by luring him into a flame of some sort.
---
This is certainly MUCH more interesting than the World Boss train.
---
False.  They threw the 5v5 maps right into queue as soon as they were released.  They can do it with these, too.
---
&gt; Why fuck with material prices? It makes regular day to day gameplay even less rewarding than it already is. 
---
That's the point. They are killing farms to make it so you have to buy gold with gems.
---
And within the first 10 seconds of playing it, I can already see that Red side has a clear terrain advantage from match start....it baffles me how little effort goes into testing these things from Anet...
---
But doesn't that defeat the purpose of using a tag for the event? You can't solo it, so you'd need people to follow you. Maybe not a zerg, but still.
---
Yeah, I don't think there are many if any champions in central tyria that will not die in less then 10sec in this event. So it only makes sense if you need to kill multiple for extra loot.
---
Beautiful axe, shield, and hammer. The rest is meh.
---
Really this.
---
Less noble armor! More warrior armor! I want something badass not cute...
---
Yeah I have noticed the Thunderhead Peaks metas often don't have a group...or the group they do have is looking rather sparse.
---
They did announce it as being something bigger.  
---
This whole update topic, was 2v2 map and mist weapons, even though it only says map, they kinda hyped it up to be something bigger.
---
Never the less, still big dissatpointment between my friends and I.
---
Was it caused by misinterpreting the information? Obviously Yes. Was it okay of us to expect more than actually just a map for 2v2, that you have to buy and it can only be played in a custom mode, that no one really plays? I would say, yes.
---
There's a mirage build where you can solo legendary bounties, so I'd say you can use that for this event.
---
For "courtier" fantasy? Definitely.
---
Maybe future ranked 2v2
---
From limited testing (solo run of fractal level 7) there are Krait adds and %HP based invuln phases requiring group to kill Kraits channeling shield on boss. There might be something more than that on t4. Dolphin path is shorter - 1/3rd is replaced by some trash and champion, there is also 1 krait pack on on start less (no need to /gg to go to entrance).
---
Aaaaaand build templates are broken again. Ugh.
---
haha my bad.
---
Yeah the glider is pretty cool. Your character however, not so much.
---
finally, some human clothes that arent covered in multilevel marketing scheme trinkets
---
There is quite few pants for any weight female armors, with some mix and matching you can make it work.
---
They do read reddit. It's literally part of their job to search for community feedback through reddit from what I'm told :D
---
You seem only interested in talking about a single stack even though the video I gave you above and my comment specifically refered to ID thousands of them.  
---
Additionally, my proposed fix doesn't remove any of your choices, it just lets you make the choice faster with less inventory management.  Not sure why your against that.
---
thank you for being the only person who didnt come to this thread just to unload stress on the OP
---
Whoops, didn't see you replied so soon. I was going to test if superspeed traited gyros actually did give you a lengthened duration before replying, since there's the slight possibility it takes their buff off (don't think it does, but wanted to make sure).
---
Uhm.. for those wondering what my comment was before I deleted it, it was something like: "Have you tried a Scrapper for superspeed? You move fairly quickly at full debuff and can keep it up for a while by using gyros before picking up the treasure".
---
So? People do things for more reasons than just rewards. Some people might just want to get gold for its own sake, as a challenge.
---
Reminds me of Penny Polendina from RWBY.
---
&gt;2186119_0105 	Enable Anti-addiction Reminders
---
This one is kinda bullshit. It feels like it's either to meet some country's regulations, or some other ulterior motive.
---
You can't be a company "concerned" about addiction, while still selling loot boxes. Period.
---
If anything, it feels more like a slap in the face to farmers.
---
There's been enough warrior armor lately! I want more dashing armor!
---
(Can we fight to the death now? En garde?????)
---
If you have too many people around it is simpler to just ignore the coals ...
---
You basically want to use the 2nd tag (invisible) to organize a small coa kill team. You don't want people from the zerg to randomly show up since it will scale up the coa sub-event.
---
someone do hitler
---
&gt; PvP map
---
False alarm, this is the new 2v2 map added today, not an upcoming thing.
---
this is horrible and egregious, if its not a bug i will be really disappointed in anet.
---
But not enough top combinations to make a nice suit, which is what I'm getting at here.  Yes, I have a ton of characters, I know what my limited options are already.  Aka, very limited.
---
That doesn't mean I have to be happy every time I see "Here's a BADASS suit for looking AMAZING and HOT.  Oh, you got tits? Eh, here's an old duvet."
---
If you haven't already, two easy things to try would be the -repair [Command Line Argument](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments#-repair) and [clearing your game cache](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5bncp5/psa_dont_forget_to_clear_your_cache/).  Hope one of those fixes it!
---
The event can actually fail if coas are completely ignored. The average group needs at least one coa wipe before the boss dies.
---
You don't even need to do cat tag, people just mark the leader with a target.
---
Wait... people still play wvw?
---
I haven't had any problems getting meta events going. MAYBE dragonfall has been a little light on people, but I'd attribute that more to people getting tired of it/finishing the meta achievements.
---
And female charr, get the male counterpart once again.
---
Sigh.
---
I‚Äôve played GW2 for almost 5 years and I have no idea what this means
---
I'm doing this too! what region are you in?
---
Not even maps like Draconis Mons, Bloodstone Fen, Thunderhead Peaks, etc?
---
Searing and Godless together yes please
---
Look, scrapper pulse was making thieves sad, okay? So it got destroyed. For balance! (You monster)
---
They're delusional. For those rewards I won't even get out of bed.
---
You've blinded John Wick's dog, prepare to die.
---
gz :)
---
No amount of QA testing can compare with players actually trying the thing. 
---
That's something that you should have know too. 
---
Before they can get 2v2 tournaments going, they'll have to have at least a few 2v2 arenas ready. A single map would not cut it. 
---
It's incredible they've been so fast at it with maybe 2 and a half people and maybe a cardboard cutout of another person on the job.
---
For weapons that look "alright" at best? hmm okay.
---
&gt;mordrem-moth
---
Thats the final boss i want to see! A giant potato insect with cute wings
---
what was that? you want 3 extra masterwork gear? okay!
---
Ok
---
The August 30th "reveal", whatever it is, best be hype -_-
---
&gt; Endless Champion Angry Chest Tonic
---
The mimics are coming.
---
Ty:3
---
They just look unfinished.
---
**Strike Freedom Gundam Intensifies**
---
If the rewards meet the effort required (Or they remove weekly caps but that seems unlikely) then it could be a really good event actually.
---
I imagine lots of people would be trying it out at the very least.
---
god damn wow has had arenas for years and they are all symmetrical. there is no reason for this not to be the case given the only objective is to kill the other team
---
godless looks awesome
---
Oh great, another over the top, overly saturated dyes to make the game even more of a circus
---
High key Gw1 Mesmer Elite armor vibes...
---
NA
---
I cannot talk for others but I farm Boss Blitz for tokens. Weekly vendors have Tyrian Exchange Vouchers that can be exchanged for various dungeon currency. For someone who dislikes dungeons, organised Blitz is a decent option. 
---
Please also consider that a very well organised map can have up to 4 Boss Blitzes per hour. It gives 4x80 (320) tokens for Blitz and 4x40 (160) tokens for races. Mobs also drop some tokens, but not enough to make a big difference. So, an organised map rewards up to 480 tokens/hour compared to 80-160 tokens/hour on a non-organised map (1 or 2 bronze reward Blitzes per hour).  It is a significant improvement for those who still need festival rewards (skins, nodes, etc.) or looking to buy currencies. 
---
I am also not sure where you got your information about effortless silver by pugs. In my anecdotal experience, non-organised groups never get even close to the silver. It takes them sometimes up to 50 min to kill all bosses.
---
just check the in-game descriptions of the pip-bonuses
---
You get a reward for being a commander with a public tag in WvW. (As long as you have at least 10 people in your squad)
---
I've been thinking about getting that game (on the PS4), would you recommend it to someone who loves Gw2 and similar arpgs? (Currently playing through Dragon's Dogma, love that game too).
---
I am good friends with BenP, he has said pretty much all of this openly.
---
What expansions do you have? Do any professions appeal to you specifically?
---
No extra pips for you!
---
No, it's exactly like the other 2v2 maps that have been in the game for ages now.
---
Haha, it's funny how you assume management is thinking at all. I mean ever since they decided that there wasn't gonna be an expansion this year they proved to us they aren't thinking, at all, I honestly have no idea what kind of management shitshow they are running there but it sure as hell is running the game to ground.
---
Season 1 remake is what the clues fit, as far as I can see.
---
* Flame and Frost-coloured logo
---
* Snow-themed e-mail
---
* No cliffhanger at the end of current story
---
* Suggestion that some future releases will improve an existing maps instead of adding a new one
---
* Re-homing Dragon Bash after analysing old story
---
I‚Äôm pretty excited for the possibility, and I suspect that most active players started after Season 1 ended and have never experienced it. One big change would be that the player character could be voice acted, and that alone would make for story alterations. Also, a second chance at telling the Scarlet story.
---
Because otherwise they might have to look at stronghold to pretend to care about PVP and they don't want to be reminded about that.
---
This exactly.  My WvW guild hides their tag because we like small squad havoc play.  Only people in the guild (or friends of the guild) get in the squad.  This will make it much easier for us and we've been waiting for this for a while.
---
More mindless open world zerg content...
---
I really wish they would add a 2v2 queue.  These map additions make me wonder if they are simply trying to get enough of a map variety before supporting the mode - but that feels a bit silly.
---
Axes have looked silly since 2005 üíÄ
---
Yep.
---
I tend to watch pvp the most on twitch. Lot‚Äôs of WoW arena 2v2 and 3v3, and battle Royale games like fortnite and apex legends. If GW2 had 2v2 and 3v3 arena I would definitely watch GW2 streams more.
---
Ooh that's cool! Feels like they're really heavily teasing Jormag, which means Primordus is not far behind.
---
As a female asura main, I'm happy to announce it's actually a dress for us too!
---
Usually the outfits use the male outfit for female asuras because.. reasons?
---
But I guess you should switch to asura if you want to wear pants, haha.
---
i was making the example that asymmetrical maps exist in standard e-sport tournament play, not whether or not they were a good thing in this case.
---
What helmet is that?
---
so if i am not online from 24th..and we dont get tier 5 by then I will not gain final rewards?
---
Charr dye kit.  Red and Blue logo.  Snowy emails.
---
Looks like the treaties are going to be broken boys and we're going to find ourselves in a Charr vs Norn war.
---
I would imagine raid sellers rubbing their hands on newcomers who buy wing clears :D
---
Knife Tail Gang = Black Lion Chest grows legs and starts running around to avoid loot box regulations.
---
This. Don't intentionally build movespeed into your kit, just get the raptor.
---
&gt; neither did the previous boss rush.
---
You high? I saw tons of players nonstop at the previous boss rush. 
---
Also the current festival isn't drawing a ton of players because Anet did nothing with it. Zephyrite boxes are completely the same(trash), no new rewards other than the weekly ones. Events need to be refreshed and updated to be worthwhile and currently Four Winds is a bad, outdated event.
---
My guild does it because even fights are hard to come by. If we have 10-30+ pugs clouding around us, groups dodge or go find more competitive fights.
---
If you mean entire 150-200+ AR party wiping molten furance t3 several times and being unable to complete t4 is "normal".
---
Ruins is a Recommended for after reset, so will try later :D
---
&gt; Also is it just me or are there no great green dyes?
---
I think the Enameled green might be a good one. There's also some more basic greens you can easily fetch off the trading post that are serviceable. 
---
~~I can't recall the names offhand though, sorry. T-T~~
---
ouch. that's ascended shard cost component for legendary armor
---
Exactly my reaction.
---
It could be, but still, a guaranteed black lion unlock per week? I feel like that's a lot more than they would want to give out. They even capped key farms to once a week and that's far less likely to give you something good.
---
Those look like fat child toys. I guess no reason to go back pvp , sweet relief :D.
---
I think there would be enough newbies that they wouldn't have to buy anything unless they was super lazy
---
Oh sorry, this post was for the bonus pip when tag is public in WvW. Completely whooshed here haha
---
Yeah, I think this is just to offset the new feature, so it doesn't encourage more people to run hidden just because they can. 
---
Hidden tags and public tags with both have their place, in the same way open and closed groups have. Today's patch just helps further define those two roles.
---
Then why release a 2v2 map to begin with. Oh yeah, so that they can claim "BUT WE'RE NOT IGNORING PVP! WE RELEASED A NEW MAP!"
---
&gt; nothing too goofy or flashy
---
Damn you really got desensitized to it in gw2, these are all really tacky
---
Or you know, it's because of you guys that hidden tag is required?
---
I don't understand what your saying.
---
You're saying only organized guild groups are going to use this feature and Arenanet should punish them enough so they open their group and you can join?
---
Nothing you do will make them open their tag because they're playing with their guild and that's what they enjoy.
---
You are truly doing the work of the Six! Thank you.
---
The boss fights are boss fights now, and much of the downtime has been removed.
---
The drill moves at turbo speed on molten, so you're only gated by how quickly you can clear the rooms. The dolphin path is a little shorter, with the end of it replaced with a champ krait to kill (and the decoy skill on the dolphin was replaced with a stealth one).
---
Yeah no, let's not rush stuff again and focus on the actual world threatening stuff instead of minor villains most characters won't even have a reason to fight.
---
I saw an NPC just like this at the Priory, though I'm not sure if his dialogue is different from that one o:
---
Yep, as the people that runs hidden tag is usually high rank.
---
Lower ranks usually don't tag up, or tag up VISIBLE because they need people on then to accomplish some objective.
---
In contrast invis tags are usually gold+ rank, already have enough people to do stuff. They will continue alienating other players.
---
I roam and run organized (heck I bought a cat tag just for my guildies to run invis) but in the long run, invisible tags won't help with keeping WvW alive.

The outfit's collar clips with certain hairstyles, as expected; the mask has minor clipping with certain faces, also not out of the ordinary. The right leg clipping that is so prevalent for certain body types is fortunately absent from this outfit, and the headpiece does not hide hair or horns. 9/10 outfit for charr.
---
It looks surprisingly good :o 
---
Most definitely one of the better looking outfits!
---
Will Victory Rock actually show your character standing or are you supposed to be transformed into that guy in the preview?
---
Could you specify the changes to the molten boss?
---
Which is kind of a shame. I'd love to be able to light up like that... but only when gliding.
---
Any time they do a shieldish focus I'm happy.
---
I think so, too! I would definitely recommend this outfit to other charr players, it has very minimal clipping issues compared to most outfits.
---
take a look at the pic at the top of this post
---
They're gonna rush no matter what. They've shown in the past they don't take their time to develop villains and kill them off on a whim. 
---
See: Lazarus
---
We've been focused on "world ending stuff" literally for years. Every release just turns into "Okay now we need to raise the stakes even more!" To the point we're raptoring across platforms in a collapsing mist reality. Like..?
---
Nope, I never said that, stop imagining things.
---
If anything visible squads should be rewarded to encourage people to play with everyone, there is no need to punish anyone.
---
While I'm sure that people *are* leaving, I would also like to suggest that school is starting back up in much of NA. And that would also impact the population of the game, especially during midday.
---
Yep!  The checkerboard weapon set!
---
='(
---
I think that you may be assuming a lot of things...
---
I've got basically all the non-exclusive greens unlocked and they're all pretty meh, especially on the shimmerwing. Even Evergreen, which looks great on basically anything, looks meh there. 
---
Acid and toxic aren't bad but don't go with my necro's colours since on the shimmer they end up more yellow than anything. Ironically enough the bright red from the Mad King pack (ember red?) makes for the best *green* on the shimmer lol. 
---
I'll have a look at the enamelleds - maybe they're good!
---
Yeah ok but how do charrs look?
---
They were fine before the 200 revamps to fractals but yes they're less annoying again.
---
I'll check that out - might be missing something fun :D
---
Dungeon tracks in PvP also give you 3 weapon boxes and 1 armor box per each reward track completion. So it speeds up considerably the collection of skins :)
---
&gt; See: Lazarus, White Mantle for anyone who didn't play raids, 
---
Or Joko or Balthazar... wait. ;)
---
I kinda laughed at the Molten Furnace speed-up, given how many it's had over the years. Eventually, if it's not there already, it's just gonna drill out the whole thing instantly.
---
I mean the last dragon included Balthazar and Joko so...
---
Because I hate arrogance like the one you showed.
---
[Different VA and different lines](https://imgur.com/a/cTOII42).
---
aaaaaand it costs 530 gold atm :/
---
the difference being that you don't need to pay gemstone to get ur free weekly key
---
Unfortunately Yes, there is no way to get pants. 
---
After Asura Pest Control cracked down on all the illegal sweatshops in Divinity's Reach, and took down the Asura Underground displacing all the child slave labor and made them orphans there just isn't any way to produce pants anymore.
---
So the typical "lets throw in everything including the kitchen sink" design ANet has been doing for a while.
---
This is the kind of shit Jawgeous talked about in his latest vid. GW2 has a self-cannibalizing community. Gamemode vs Gamemode. Fork off, trash human.
---
Wow this looks pretty neat. 
---
Would you happen to remember the boss at aquatic ruins?
---
I absolutely cannot stand turn-based combat... and I've read/seen that Divinity Original Sin 2 does some very interesting and innovative things with turn-based combat, but I personally can't stomach it. Hack-n-slash/arpg is where I'm at!
---
more frequent adds (including some krait), some nasty projectile attacks, and every 25% there are krait adds that you have to kill before you can progress (and you take pretty significant ticking aura damage while they're alive)
---
you'll definitely want a healer for the jellyfish now
---
GW1 Dapper Tuxedo for GW2 pls.
---
PMing it to you! I literally just started my character and logged out to do some other shit (havent even done 1 quest). So I'll just delete and re-roll on your server. 
---
Also, what class do you run, and are there any that synergize particularly well with it?
---
Explanation:
---
- This bug happens always when a Ready Check is started. 
---
- For some nothing changes, some see one or two "party members" just like in the picture and some see only their party members
---
- To fix this bug you have to click on the Grid View in your squad menu *after* ready check is done
---
- You can't fix it while ready check is still running
---
- This bug happens after *every* ready check so you have to fix it again and again
---
- It's pretty annoying for raid groups
---
The groups that hide tag will still hide tag. Good Fights &gt; pips  
---
We should encourage anet to add more to bring new blood to WvW, not complain when its not "the bestest" for vets. WvW is dying for a lot of reasons and lack of commanders is a big part of it. If this gets a few more people to try out commanding, it's good for the game mode.
---
Wasn't similar NPC around Hoelbrak during dragon bash?
---
Nobody feels "entitled", that is how the game mode is designed.  Flipping it over, you are not entitled to having a BL map, or any specific part of a BL map, available only to you and your guild.
---
If you want 15v15 queued up instanced PvP maps, you grabbed the wrong box from off the Fry's/CompUSA shelf all those years ago.
---
Only a week? I won't be able to play, I guess next year then...
---
Honestly I love both games but GW1's plot had a lot of the same problems as GW2, especially with the whole "literally everything was Abaddon" retcon.
---
Yeah, exactly - Lazy.
---
I know people play boss blitz, what I was trying to say is that it's not to the point where meta events aren't firing.
---
We don't know how champion rush will work out, it's new. Maybe because it's less organized people will just play normally and get rewards over time? It may just motivate people to kill champs they come across on maps instead of ignore them. Maybe it'll bring back champ trains like the old Frostgorge days, but even then that will probably draw the endless RIBA grinders more than the people playing meta events.
---
I would call it lack of design.
---
It's such a simple change that I don't see a downside. Maybe it will encourage pip farmers to start running a tag for small groups? That isn't a bad thing.
---
Joko wasn't treated better than Lazarus? We meet Lazarus and kill him a matter of minutes later.
---
I've looked in Snowden Drifts but didn't find anyone. I wonder if there is someone in each of the shiverpeaks maps with different dialogue.
---
They are aware of the issue don't worry
---
I once ran gw1 for a full week during an event. More than once. Was interesting to see "You have been playing for 120 hours. Please take a break."
---
backpack is a weapon in game code - no possible, early game decision. Best they can do is make a handful of models with different colours that you can pick from, which honestly would be a nice addition and huge selling point for little to no work.
---
I have a suspicion that Jormag won't be the front-and-center villain in LS5. They're teasing him really heavily, which to me means they have some kind of twist planned. Jormag may be the backdrop for this season but something else will show up as the proper "villain." Maybe that's somewhat wishful thinking, but I don't think it's an unrealistic assumption.
---
Plus, we have all-new insight into Elder Dragons and all that, so that offers way more opportunities for this to feel totally different to the previous dragons. I'm still open-minded about it for now.
---
I think giving open tags an extra three pips is discriminating against people who want to run closed.
---
I was looking at which weapon is raised.
---
They should experiment with running a short 2v2 queue during the 2 week off-season.
---
Is this new also?
---
&gt; * The Customize window now has a search bar to filter options by name.
---
&gt; * Options on the right side of the Customize window are now sorted alphabetically.
---
Yay, they got it right on the 2nd try :)
---
This sub was filled with complains about Joko. It was discussed a lot, so let's set on "to each their own". :) If you're satisfied with Joko's plotline, then good (no sarcasm implied).
---
Well, weebs will have a chance to cosplay Erza properly, at last.
---
No, they aren't, only a person is.
---
If a whole hidden guild group would earn +3 additional pips for running visible, now, that would make a difference since guildies might ask for staying visible for those extra pips. And while that may lead to randoms to occasionally follow and be rallybots, it would be up to the guild group weighting the pros and cons in a case by case basis, relegating hidden groups to situational scenarios, giving WvW a little healthier community on the mid term.
---
Currently, established groups run taggless because is the safer way to enjoy a dying game mode, extra people would help revitalize WvW, but hidden groups don't help with getting more people interested in WvW.
---
Today, organized groups are between the rock and a hard place, they want more people in WvW but they have run invisible, alienating the remaining population in order to maximize their fun time (prime time). That's because outside prime time, WvW is barren!
---
WvW is bleeding people, any little change that could earn us more bodies would be greatly welcomed; +3 pips for the tagged person accomplish nothing, I even have serious doubts about it being an effective counter to the behavioural reinforcement created by ANet formalizing hidden squads.
---
Me too buddy...
---
can you color it?
---
The problem with this set is that it don't appeal to either of the two types of fashion wars players, people who like practical+cool looking things, and those who like flashy, special-effect stuff. This set is closer to practical+cool except that the proportions and filigree are too comical to be taken seriously.
---
We're all waiting until the 30th, then we'll know more.
---
&gt; isn't it specified
---
I wouldn't know for sure. I vaguely recall them talking about it, but I have no grasp on the details. If you can find that, I'd be really interested to read/listen to it again.
---
I wasn't exactly referring to the Torment, though. Not exactly, at least. It's more that Kralk was benevolent *at all* and wasn't wholeheartedly driven toward destruction. Whether the other Elder Dragons are corrupted by magic/Torment or simply are evil, that remains to be seen. But at least there's that chance that Aurene could help us cleanse Jormag before we are forced to kill him. (If that's even what's going on with him).
---
Plus, if you look at some of /u/Varorson's comments regarding Elder Dragons (tagging him in case he wants to fill in), he proposes that Jormag isn't all about consuming magic, as much as establishing a society based around strength with him as the theoretical pinnacle of it all. There are hints around the game that he isn't particularly interested in forcefully corrupting people, but rather prefers to corrupt those who seek it out to strengthen themselves.
---
All that to say, Jormag has some nuance going on, and I see a few different ways this could go. So as much as I'm also wearing thin on my patience for Elder Dragons, I'm still intrigued by how they handle this.
---
The can't tag watch if everybody is a tag.
---
It was really easy to still find groups for either as long as you tagged up. But now with the events and festivals it's actually not possible anymore.
---
Branded minions have always been pretty mindless in the game, while Icebrood have always been rooted in this idea of corrupting oneself for more power. Their story lines have always been related to individual sentient creatures.
---
Personally I'm excited for the Spirits of the Wild to re-enter the story. There's so much potential for them as allies (and masteries). Since the way to deal with dragons properly seems to be transferring their magic to benevolent beings, maybe the story will end with some kind of ascension of the Spirits of the Wild?
---
I'm also excited for the concept of the northern Shiverpeaks being a wild abandoned place that we venture into. In the movement of the world the Norn had to flee south, so we wouldn't be bumping into established towns, more so ruined camps that they left behind. The image in the newsletter of a snowy cave entrance gave me serious vibes of GW1's Ice Tooth Cave, which was a remote cave hideout in the wilderness during a long desolate part of your journey over the Shiverpeaks. It could give more of an adventuring feel rather than a "my fleet of airships is right behind me" one we've been getting recently.
---
I think there's plenty of opportunity to be excited about. I certainly can't blame anyone who wants to jump on the negative outlook bandwagon, though.
---
I *knew* I've seen it somewhere!
---
The glider gives me Shiro'ken vibes.
---
Please tell me Audra get the female version
---
That is nice teasing of future stuff. I like that a lot!
---
JOTUN! 
---
It might be a good opportunity to dig into old jotun lore, what they knew about dragons and astrology.
---
&gt;It's pretty annoying for raid groups
---
Agreed. At this point we even stopped doing the ready check because of how annoying it is and we've been yelling out stuff like "*3 2 1 GO !*" instead of ready checking so far.
---
Oh, what will happen at 30th?
---
&gt; If you want 15v15 queued up instanced PvP maps
---
This is not a thing, Please don't spread misinformation.
---
Kralk is the first Elder Dragon we've fought that had been dealing with the repercussions of eating too many flavours of magic unprepared, but there's no reason to believe that Jormag and Primordus aren't having similar issues (or would be, if they were awake). It's possible that Balthazar sucking some juice out of them reduced the issue, but that remains to be seen.
---
Did you try slowing it down? Seems elongated. Honestly want to say its saying "release me" with other words repeated but I'm likely hearing what I'm expecting it to say and not what it does say.
---
Announcement about LS5
---
dragonjade axe looks pretty good imo, so does the firebrand and mirage ones.
---
I feel like the Sons of Svanir may not necessarily want to wake Jormag up, rather they just want to use his energy to strengthen themselves. Jormag is treated like another spirit of the wild that they worship. The spirits exist and they manifest in the world, but Bear itself isn't there mauling all the dredge that don't respect him. The Sons of Svanir likewise may not want Jormag flying around freezing everything.
---
Idk who Jawgeous is, but I'd say at least 50% I spend in GW2 is in WvW. I'd say WvW players respect PVP players, and jokingly trash PvE players. The same kinda thing happens in most games I'd say (e.g. PvE players respect PvP players, but PvPers hate PvEers). But the main things that are killing WvW are:
---
1. **Server Transfers -** Guilds transfer off of servers, to more dead servers, leaving their old servers to die or have more players transfers to other servers. Sad thing, but it's probably the main way WvW has been monetized.
---
2. **Stale/Dead Meta -** WvW as a gamemode hasn't really seen any new changes to the metas/maps, besides the introduction of the Warclaw.
---
3. **Warclaw -** The Warclaw was an interesting addition, but did nothing to help WvW. In fact, it probably hurt it more in the long-term.  It is a hefty barrier for new players trying to get into WvW, as well as casual players. In addition to this, it has almost effectively gotten rid of roamers (which constitute at least a part of the WvW community, though largely disliked by blob players). While some may argue that the Warclaw introduced more players to WvW, it really didn't, as most people have already been aware of the WvW gamemode, now it's just harder for newer players and HoT/F2P players to get into.
---
Personally, I'd say these are the main things. I still see a lot of old players/commanders around, but none of them really want to comm pugs because there just isn't the numbers to compete.
---
I love this kind of thing its a great showcase of what the game and players can do. Plus ya know its cool and fun :D.
---
Icebrood are fairly mindless too, as highlighted during A Crack in the Ice. All "grunt" dragon minions are. For those that corrupt animals (icebrood, branded, and risen) the intelligent ones are always champions and lieutenants, even weak ones.
---
So I wouldn't expect much there tbh. It'll most likely be a religious counterpart to the risen's kingdom of undead vocality.
---
&gt; Kralk is the first Elder Dragon we've fought that had been dealing with the repercussions of eating too many flavours of magic unprepared
---
Wait, what kind of magic flavours? Torment already, errm, tormented him by the time he killed Glint, so he was mad with pain before eating Zhaitan's, Mordy's and Balthazar's/Blood Stone magic. That just a genuine question btw. The answer "ate too much magic in general" is as good as any other until Anet will reveal more. :)
---
See, *that* I like.
---
i mean just look at boss blitz now compaired to the first 2 times they where out, most of the time you see only 1 map in lfg atm on weekends 2.
---
People just dont care about festivals anymore and doing this festival event festival thing just further points out that the feature of gw2 isnt looking bright, the only reason it lived as long as it did was more that they are almost no greater MMOs made as years ago thanks to mobile and microtransactions
---
Well they closed Gandara on EU again. Which i find to be hilarious. This last week we have had a maybe a queue of 4-6 people on one border during the very prime time of EU. rest of the border have no queue and some are even outnumbered. And yet Gandara is apparently full.
---
Even LS2, while it was told almost exclusively through instanced content, still interacted with new and existing locations beyond the initial setup. It wasn't unheard of to rush off to an old map to see some of the story play out. I miss that. It's not just rushing off to a new location and leaving it behind forever that sucks-- and that massively sucks. But also it sucks that the core world feels totally cut off from anything new that we do.
---
I imagine commanders running public until they max their pips for the week, then switching private
---
i don't think the game needs anti-addiction reminder, not like it has enough content *cough*
---
They've repeated a few times recently in interviews: the story of GW2 is the story of dragons. We're not getting away from dragons any time soon. Look at what they did with Kralk at the end. Don't tell me that wasn't both epic and interesting.
---
Based on what we know there will not be an expansion in 2019. I wouldn't expect one for at least a year.
---
They said another season of living world is next. On the previous release cadence that is 1.5-2 years of content releases. One of the things people are hoping for is the announcement of a faster cadence, which could bring a potential expansion up to fall 2020. That part is 100% speculation though.
---
[deleted]
---
I hope they stop killing my spirits on switching game modes (going underwater, surfacing, mounting)
---
What makes these....misty though, just look ornately bland
---
Well it *used to* make sense. Back when the only way to obtain ascended gear was to play fractals (rings) and the only way to obtain infusions was to play fractals. The mechanic was meaningful back then, as they said in their blog post (fractals announcement) it was about playing and doing your best despite agony to earn stuff to be able to make it easier and progress further.
---
Nowadays it's pointless with ascended gear being easy to access (and easy to get full equipment *before* entering fractals, even rings since they have other sources) and even infusions just costing gold on the tp. TBH IMHO they should have removed AR system altogether instead of spending time revamping it. Except for a few new players who quickly learn otherwise, people don't try to resist 6/12/18% agony ticks while trying to obtain gear anymore, they just make sure they have enough beforehand so agony=1%. And fractals are balanced around that.
---

glad you guys are getting to enjoy it together :) she'll be joining me tonight and checking it out so im pretty excited for that
---
ArenaNet has left it up to debate whether Kralk's Torment is unique or not. All we know is that it was eons old and was made by consuming too much magic over the centuries. It would make sense for other ED to have their own form of torment but we dont know if they do or why Kralkatorrik's personality began to split at the end of his life (given that Edge of Destiny novel was showcasing purely the Torment's mentality it seems Kralkatorrik's true self was either subconscious at the time or conpletely one with the torment).
---
This and paper tanking in pvp....
---
Really any class can roam/havoc, but I'd look at conquest (PvP) builds for small scale fights. The meta build for large group scourge is very dependent on the squad and at a huge disadvantage in small fights.
---
It is?? *incoherent glee noises*
---
&gt; (no more roleplay dialogue here either)
---
#NOOOOOO!
---
I absolutely unironically loved that guy. Never failed to crack me up. Dammit!
---
Different people want different things. I never asked for more festivals or bonus event spam. I've always asked for less temporary content. This has been more than a month of non-stop temporary content.
---
Yeah weird me too. He said he opposite.
---
Which is another explanation for them putting the patch note. They might had accidentally disabled it elsewhere too but now its only in PvP
---
And the people who know what they do don't know what order is optimal for DPS; just press them all
---
I believe they can but they need to be like Caladbolg and be character dependent. It's a shame that ANet doesn't bother with them. The side stories would be perfect for tying up small loose ends or showing the influence of plots on far reaching regions.
---
I've been thinking this too.
---
It would make a cool parallel between Jormag and Aurene if they both had willing mortal champions.
---
MOOOOOOOOD
---
No one who quits comes back for a update. That's just a casual player. Nothing wrong with casuals but they are the ones coming back and leaving.  People who are really quitting don't come back for much of anything.
---
Lol I wish I did xD
---
Implication that the mapmakers also code the matchmaking feature
---
Ohhh myyy godddd, I've been waiting to see Jormag since this game came out!
---
I'm so hyped it's ridiculous. This is going to be the ONLY thing on my mind for the next two weeks :)))
---
Currently we got three 2v2 maps. That's not enough for a game mode, YET. I guess they plan to implement a new mode, but therefore they need to design more maps. BE PATIENT.
---
Thank Dwayna that it doesn't have a unique player animation or I would be tormenting the inhabitants of the Mistlock Sanctuary with my troll spider tonic to DEATH.
---
^^^^^^I'm ^^^^^^scum
---
To clarify: Kralkatorrik was never benevolent. ANet stressed this during the War Eternal Guild Chat, just because he loved his family and aided us in the end against his torment doesn't mean he was a good guy before being tormented by the magic he consumed eons ago.
---
My interpretation is that Kralkatorrik was effectively a racist against mortals. If his words about not fearing anything, even death, is true, then the reason he had so strongly desired to prevent his vision from occurring wouldnt be fear of his demise but dislike of peace between mortals and dragons. He loved his family but hated mortals so much he wouldn't stand for peace with them. Unless of course he was already afflicted by the magic's torment when he had that vision.
---
As for Jormag not being all about consuming magic: I'd say this about all of the dragons. Even Kralkatorrik's goal wasn't focused on magic, but rather his goal (or more accurately, his Torment's goal) was to consume and destroy *everything*. From what I've seen, they each have their owb goal, and consuming magic is a means to an end for them (one that results in a painful addiction to desire endlessly consuming magic).
---
It's rather disappointing we killed Zhaitan first since, like Jormag, he seems to most nuanced and even capable of becoming allied based on observed intentions. Both can easily be interpreted as having noble intentions that have gone horribly wrong.
---
Zhaitan showcased a desire to rule a deathless nation where folks never separate from loved ones; but he goes about this by slaughtering and raising everything as slaves, giving no option to object his ways. Jormag offers power to all who seek it, even lets those who refuse go away, but actively makes the world inhospitable to kill off the weak and promotes savagery and "brutality makes right" mentality among his minions.
---
Mordremoth's apparent desires were interesting too and I think had HoT not been horribly rushed we might've gotten more into what seems to be a desire to be the sustenance of the world (according to Aerin, Mordremoth wanted to destroy Tyria, but at the same time we see him cloning everyone, proclaiming to be home for everything, and even says "I am this world."). One could also interpret this as a "noble intention gone horribly evil" like Zhaitan and Jormag. And I really wish they'd explore this aspect a bit more.
---
Far more interesting than Primordus' apparent desire to kill all life, and we still got nothing on the DSD which by this point is nothibg less than annoying. So I'm really hoping they do Jormag justice like Kralkatorrik, since the two other interesting ED motivations got effectively shafted.
---
Aww, thank you so much :D
---
Care to explain for people who do not like / do not follow anime please? lol any link to that character? what/who is she?
---
exactly. now they can use the map selection wheel for the future implementation.
---
You haven't properly bonded as a raid group until your commander has gotten bored of waiting, yelled out "GO!" in voice, and you've all scrambled to get into the arena before the walls instakill you. Good times, good times.
---
Great video.
---
Very annoying music.
---
In the same vein, but is it too much to ask for to have the ability for my handsome dashing male knight to wear a dress too? I know he'd look pretty in one, don't deny the guy who took down three elder dragons the ability to look pretty Anet.
---
I see your point. I was referring to this dev quote where they mention compelling madness:
---
&gt; Tom Abernathy: At the end of the story Kralkatorrik says "I hope you never have to kill what you love." Is this referring to Glint? Yes. What Kralkatorrik is saying in that moment is that this madness compelled me to do things that I did not necessarily want to do, and that's been a horrible thing for him to have to bear and experience even while he's essentially trapped inside this giant, tormented dragon body. So yeah, Kralk has regrets, he's got a few. ¬©
---
Though at this point it doesn't really matter, does it. Since Kralk was old and ate who knows how much conflicting magic even before GW2's plotline.
---
It‚Äôs actually based on BenP saying they won‚Äôt make a que.
---
meanwhile in raids every boss is a stationary dps golem, also boring.
---
seems like the most interesting bosses they make are ones that can walk
---
In regards to most PvE builds, that's pretty much everything that isn't Weaver. Staff builds for a long time were CampFire‚Ñ¢ until Fresh Air Tempest and Weaver became things.
---
Weaver was designed to stray away from that single-element playstyle.
---
I can‚Äôt wait until we get 10 man list view
---
Yes yes very yes. Too bad they're super expensive, but I guess adding more rewards for the endgame of those game modes is a very good thing.
---
I'll take that as a compliment... :D
---
My anxiety will come to an end
---
I still think the main villian will be Drakkar. This suspisious traveler has whispers around him much like how Drakker whispered to Svanir in GW1
---
Imagine a PvP map with SAB slippery ice. üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
---
I deciphered female voice by reversing. It's like... "Who you... Come, come, come .... [silence] You are safe.. Do you... to survive." It sounds somewhat like Glint. Wonder if it's some mist trick. By this point I wouldn't be suprised that Jormag is female. Or it's one of his champions.
---
there's a lot of story in dynamic events and meta events in GW2 that fill in for traditional story quests
---
as I get older, I've no time to stand there and read walls of text, just to kill 2 rats and escort an NPC and listen to them prattle (not saying GW1 is like that...it's a lot more interesting than that, from what I've played of it, but most MMOs with traditional questing are just so mindnumbing after GW2's approach to storytelling)
---
&gt;invisible tags won't help with keeping WvW alive.
---
Not true. I view the change as an all-around positive one for the following reasons:
---
1) It will encourage others to tag for the extra pips, especially when one pugmander has tagged down and the squad still has numbers to continue. Not every commander raids 4+ nights a week to complete diamond, and not every commander is Gold+, especially newer Commanders-in-training.
---
2) Private raids serve a function. Namely, they are good for organized fight guilds to run tightly comped builds and proper parties. They allow for practice and improvement, which will increase enjoyment, which increases retention. Too much is a bad thing, but once/twice per week is good.
---
Our guild (on a T1 NA server) raids 4+ nights per week, usually once private. It rewards open tag play (which our T1 server needs, often there is only 1-2 tags running in NA primetime), and it allows us to practice without being clouded by rallybot greens which make it difficult to determine whether our guild is performing properly in fights.
---
They are ugly! (The sword and shield looks decent but that's it)
---
I am sorry  \^\^ but byside the music taste - thank you a lot! ‚ô°
---
That looks like the PoF commander "stand-in" character, Duncan, it should be your character doing that pose.
---
Careful, you'll invite non-arguments about how limited sexual dimorphism in charr means they can't ever be allowed to wear dresses.
---
Classic wow stress test
---
It would be nice if they would add a 5v5v5 (as oppose to 3 nodes) death match map first to a predefined max score of kills wins. Similar to ESOs deathmatch, would be fun at least.
---
o feck, its the [master](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Master)
---
Or you can look at it the other way, it rewards them who want to run open, which helps keep the game mode alive. Since nothing has changed for private raids with the exception that it's easier to follow the commander, I'm a bit confused as to how it's "discriminating" against them. FWIW our guild runs 1 (and infrequently 2) private raid(s) per week.
---
GW1 had that feature.
---
Joko was perfect, all he needed was a bit of a good meta against him that we never got.  
---
Same as Dragons, we can't have enormous "nature" creatures of destruction without any meaningful impact. And because Anet will never do it right, like a meta that a dragon destroys a city, etc. such a shame for so good lore ;(
---
I wonder if the whispering at each NPC is different...
---
\#BlameDrakkar
---
arent jormag and all his champions whispering like this? iirc in the book the jormag dragon champion they killed was also getting into ppl's heads
---
Dunno i got my skyscale on the second day it was possible to get, the LS4 stuff took me \~17h (combined) from 0-&gt;250. As for numbers it is clear that many have by now the skyscale (i just say treasure hunt in the cliffs). Also i saw plenty people using the skins.
---
People are buying them and not to less. What makes me kinda sad is that you have to spend 30‚Ç¨ if you want one of those skins, this bundle stuff really makes me willing not to buy one, 10‚Ç¨ maybe but not 30‚Ç¨ (im ignoring gold-&gt;gem).
---
The only time i buy a skin is when one of those selection licenses comes on sale.
---
Guild wars 3: immortal is coming out on all iPhone and android (mobile) devices. With more gem store items that you can imagine and since most people enjoy the open world spam your autos mindset. It will even play the game for you, while you go watch Netflix.
---
Hey mate, I think you dropped a 1. I picked it up for you!
---
Yeah, tell me more. Now we are goinna see double amount of it.
---
My game dont crush like candy crush.
---
That sounds incredibly ham fisted and kinda cringe so it would be right in Anet's wheelhouse.
---
Didn't have green screen of that
---
[*wierd orc and Uruk noises*]
---
Why does it sound like female Voice?
---
If I remember right it takes an average of 3 boxes to gain a level. So basically the inverse.
---
Erza is one of the main characters in Fairy Tail anime. [She has the magic powers to summon/equip any magic weapon/armor she has in her disposal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19vdU8uLtkM)
---
I wish this was an actual (optional, of course) feature, because grid UI lacks boon display. Grid UI on top, party UI below it, for however much space there is on the screen. Could reduce the need of support players having to rely on third-party tools to measure how they perform boon-wise.
---
Controversial Opinion:
---
I actually quite liked Scarlet, even back when she was first introduced and my fellow role players all hated her. 
---
Honestly, I think that most of the "smaller" villains (that is, the ones that aren't the Elder Dragons) have been pretty solid, outside of needing a bit more time for characterization and further exploration. But I think they are far from the worst villains in MMO history, and I would even dare to say they can be considered good (enough) among RPG's in general.
---
Beginning with Scarlet, I really only wished they'd given her more characterization in-game - There were some awesome little short stories that really explained some of her development and motivations at least a bit better, but those were only ever posted on the blog or forums. It would have been neat to see these implemented as fractals, dungeons, or world events at some point.
---
I think the same can go for others we've seen - I thought the White Mantle, Caudecus, Saul, and others were all well done, but some more exploration of their individual motivations would have been appreciated.
---
I think Joko was great and was easier for them to implement since he had existed in GW1 and didn't exactly *need* the same sort of build up, and even if it was propaganda, we even had the occasional glimpse of his earlier life as a lich (and prior, even, if I recall some of the in-game books and things I read correctly...) 
---
But, I think of all the villains so far, Balthazar was the most egregious example of things going wrong. We knew he wanted to go rogue and be the only god, but... Why? Sure, I  guess the god of war makes the most sense of any, so it's easy to assume that he just loss sight of the "honor" part of things, and the gods in GW2 are shown to be more than just perfect beings - they have flaws and their own more down-to-earth origins, just like other races (even if they are shrouded in mystery, we at least know them to be real, tangible beings.) But... Why did Balthazar do all the stuff he did, exactly?
---
**Tl;dr** - I actually think almost all the villains we've had have been really good, but could use more screen time, build up, and general characterization just to give us a more concrete idea for their motives. Leaving us to wonder and only have some solid speculation is fine sometimes, but it's a running trend with our villains.
---
&gt;Edit:  I think this is what's being said: "Do you want... - Come - Come - COME - COME ... You are safe - Do you want to survive?"
---
On top of that, the voice sounds rather... feminine to me. Jormag = female joke confirmed canon?
---
Fair point. This one for me sounds in a similar vein to "yesn't", so I'm not sure what she's saying there.
---
Reread what I said. The beetle collection didn't have timegates despite the fact that the actual beetle was growing from an infant during the collection. Passage of time was the reason for the literal timegates in the skyscale collection despite that not being the case for the beetle (which wasn't a problem then).
---
Making the same amount of content take longer is, by definition, stretching content. They never removed the timegates. Just because it didn't bother you doesn't make it any less stupid.
---
but ANGRY chest tonic this time.
---
Oh yeah, I love the linkshell system in FFXIV. Would be nice to have something similar. That way you would not need a guild to have a simple multi person private chat with friends.
---
I'm hesitant to count Joko since he's back from GW1, but honestly he's the only villain I've found to be even remotely intimidating in GW2.
---
Didn't they do that on purpose to prevent you from stacking spirits?
---
RemindMe! 3 Months Are norn humans babi as real as horses
---
"I can outrun a centaur"
---
&gt;For context, it's not the sound from video, but one of 20... \[few of them repeat, with different noise or repeating of words\]
---
Any chance you can get them all? :)
---
Looks like ArenaNet's taking to the joke of making Jormag female after all. Not sure whether to laugh or cry or both.
---
Minister Caudecus Beetlestone begs to differ.
---
&gt; you'll definitely want a healer for the jellyfish now
---
Poor Ventari Revenant unable to handle the water.
---
I'm kinda sad floating weapons were turned into a backpack skin, instead of being used for a future elite specialization mechanic.
---
But hey, the same happened with guardian tomes and Binding of Ipos, so can't say I'm surprised :(.
---
I did say I'd play again, at least for a bit, if we finally went to the only region I really care about, so I hope this means Jormag.
---
I fly a lot in this game. I barely do anything else tbh.   
---
After some time you get used to the griffon and what you can do with it.
---
And yes, I love this skin very much!
---
Underwater legendary weapon or peasant.
---
I have to agree. In this case, I say yes to the dress.
---
Now if only fractals had any interesting rewards aside from gold...
---
Still hoping they revamp Molten and Aetherblade some day, giving us something like Nightmare.
---
Nope, it's one guy with multiple accounts, all commanders have (almost) the same name.
---
I have a ryzen 2700 and a rtx 2060 and can keep up 40 FPS in zergs (with character limit and models at low). Probably take a 2600x or whatever‚Äôs good in ryzen 3000 series and a 1660ti would be solid.
---
Stronghold and Deathmatch got made into game modes with a single map each...
---
Maybe the Sons of Svanir are just sexist and Jormag is really female? not sure.
---
Courtyard was in the queue though, it was my favourite mode because it required teamfight instead of  backcapping points
---
If only there were reasons to spy in the game mode...
---
It's baffling they won't add these to the unranked queue. Just baffling.
---
You are incorrect. It does exist (or at least it did), just not in GW2
---
Maybe they should start caring about fun before balance. Just saying.
---
Is there a 10 man option to get squads like that? Id love to have my group look like that with the boons and all, never really tested it.
---
Pod racing &lt;3  
---
Now I wanna watch that movie again.  
---
Thank you a lot!
---
Yeah same. I did look at some games but none seems to use skill-based mounts. Only normal walking and flappy-flapp-flying mounts. It's kinda sad.
---
They said they're probably not gonna write a villain like Joko again and I really don't understand why. Everyone liked him even the writers themselves loved writing for him.   
---
If they do focus on dragons now I want them to have character, like they sort of tried to imply with Kralk and Mordremoth. Maybe instead of killing them convert them somehow, help them with their instinctual cravings. It's hard for me to believe that Aurene is the only Elder Dragon that can be good. Honestly having giant, mysterious and potentially wise creatures that don't try to kill you would be such a cool thing to explore.
---
Can i buy an option to hide player effects?
---
I liked everything about the changes, except the downtime from the boss burying, having forced waits to invul is awful.
---
My memory may prove false but wasn‚Äôt there four conquest maps at launch?
---
i'm personally relieved to know my erotic roleplay is coming on august 24th.
---
&gt; "We know Dragons are a risk to the world but let me preach a little about gender equality!"
---
It's not exactly about real life gender equality but having development within the enemy faction, and making them more than cardboard slates. Even though they all have the goal of worshiping Jormag, it would make them more compelling villains if they have conflict and aspirations of their own.
---
Right now the Sons of Svanir are just typical chauvinist pigs that players beat up. They don't have dreams, hopes, or even hobbies. They're just sexist caricatures. Which is actually even more cringey.
---
If the Icebrood have their own feminist revolution, it would make them a lot more nuanced. It would also raise the stakes significantly because they would be united under Jormag.
---
Keep in mind I'm not pandering to real life gender politics here.This isn't about preaching. What I'm suggesting is a baddass villain who starts an underdog and then gains the respect of their faction.
---
I really hope that Claw of Jormag can be part of season 5 story. Just as the Shatterer was part of the history of season 4, it would be a shame if devs don't take advantage of Claw of Jormag through the story.
---
Frostgorge has several "Defeat the champion" events scattered around, but I'm not sure how many "Defend X for Y time" events or "Escort X to Y location" events it has that spawn scaling enemies.  Cursed Shore is probably going to be the best bet, but I'm sure there's going to be an oddball zone somewhere that could be exploited.  Iron Marches or Sparkfly Fen or something along those lines.
---
report and move on. rn you are just providing more exposure to the ERP and that particular "option" to further promote it... which isn't necessarily a bad thing tbh.
---
If you have the storage space for it, just bootcamp it. You get SO much more performance and access to addons line arc dps, dx912, and mount radial
---
Teasers for svanir/jormag being the next villains? Hype! There's been lots of jungle/desert maps since release but very few snow maps, gonna be fun if much of the season will be based around the shiverpeaks areas, I wanna go to the far shiverpeaks!
---
As much as I want to support the ERP, whoever is doing this should definitely be a bit more careful.

https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025563714-Policy-Looking-For-Group-LFG-Tool
---
&gt; Players may use the LFG Tool ***only*** for the formation of a group.
---
This could potentially get their account suspended, based on the above policy.
---
They even take over actual raid LFGs (without commander) and change their lfg message...
---
No, but if this were a one-time purchase it would pay for itself very quickly
---
&gt;"Listen carefully and you will hear His name"
---
To me the "COME COME" sounds DRAA KKKAAR
---
Damn you really are ignoring the current skins available in the game when it comes to comparing these. Also, take notice that I used the word "too".
---
Didn't the recent narrative ama allude to elder dragons having genders, or at least being referred to as such by Tyrians? All the √≤nes so far were seemingly masculine (though I think early concepts for Mordremoth had him be female), but we have Aurene now so maybe that's what they meant.
---
Blackgate opening for the first time in a year for two hours also coincided with the last of their most veteran and respected commanders/guilds leaving.  That probably had a greater effect on BG population than anything.
---
WvW is such an old game mode based on an old idea of PvP that many of the players and guilds have since passed their school/uni years, I've found.
---
I think the only thing we should all be able to agree on is that there's nothing we can all agree on. I liked both Scarlet and Joko, and Mordremoth, for a dragon was fine too. Not sure why, if you want to start a discussion you'd start it with a statement that is demonstrably false.
---
My problem with dragons, unlike Joko and Scarlet, is we don't really interact with them the same way. They're just sort of there and terrifying, but we don't really have conversations with Zhaitan, we fight his minions.
---
I'd rather talk directly to a villain than fight their minions and not see them.
---
Call it whatever you want; I call it stretching out content. The only benefit to forcing players to wait to complete a task is to delay the reward, usually with the hopes that players will log on and do other things because they can't finish what they want. This is literally a mobile game tactic. Just because it doesn't bother you doesn't make it any less lazy. 
---
Also; "the story requires the skyscale to grow and it gave it time to do that". 
---
You seem to have willfully ignored my initial point so I'll say it again with less words. 
---
Beetle also grew. no timegate. didn't affect anything.
---
I was absolutely *not* expecting Kralk to willingly pass the torch down to Aurene.
---
Characters in GW2 are just terrible. Villains are just the tip of the iceberg, but let's recap:
---
* **Gaheron Baelfire:** Appears and dies shortly thereafter. Returns as a ghost to be killed again, just moments later, adding insult to injury.
---
* **Kudu:** Appears in some story instances, and in two dungeons. Not too bad, but still far from enough.
---
* **Canach:** Random edgy freedom fighter beach vacation terrorism. At least he turned into a pretty decent good guy later on.
---
* **Mai Trin:** She appears, we defeat her, we imprison her, she escapes, we never hear of her ever again.
---
* **Scarlet Briar:** Awful writing until LW2, when she was already dead.
---
* **Faolain:** One of the game's best villains, partner in love to one of the main characters. Randomly killed after hyping her up during LW2 and HoT trailers.
---
* **Caudecus Beetlestone:** From mastermind to idiot. Years of scheming thrown down the toilet just to die as a filler boss.
---
* **Lazarus:** Turns out he was Balthazar in disguise, throwing his interesting redemption arc into the trashcan. The real one appears and dies a few seconds later.
---
* **Balthazar:** Betrays humankind for no reason whatsoever, because ArenaNet had no other idea than to rehash Nightfall's rogue god plot during our return to Elona. We kill him because he wanted to kill Kralkatorrik. Few episodes later, we're the ones killing Kralkatorrik. What was the goddamn point?
---
* **Palawa Joko:** Became a walking meme.
---
And I could go on and on. I just gave up years ago.
---
Ooh i love this idea of adventuring. My favourite place after echovald forest is ice tooth cave, spent all my afk time there. Was sad to see it not be a thing in gw2.
---
It might he interesting if we can stop Jormag in a different way than just killing it. Maybe with Aurene's help, Jormag's perspectige could be shifted or something.
---
Yup, Battle of Kyhlo, Forest of Niflhel, Legacy of the Foefire, and Raid on the Capricorn.
---
Wow, WvW content!
---
Yes and the beetle collection was faster and less immersive. I wasn't immersed in the beetle collection but I was immersed in the skyscale collection. Not agreeing with you is not ignoring your points. They're just points that you think are valid because you believe them strongly. My experience differs.
---
  
---
You can call time gating whatever you want. But if we can't agree on definitions and clearly we don't, we can't really talk about this so I'm out. At this  point we can agree that time gating made the collection takes longer, whether that's stretching it or not.  I on the other hand, think the collection wasn't worse for it and it did add something to the collection.   
---
No matter what definition you use, I won't agree with you and that's okay. It's okay for us to have different opinions. The rest of this argument is semantic.
---
Exactly, these kind of trashy events are doing NOTHING to help the game. In fact, they're creating a CoF1/Silverwastes/Tarir/Istan effect, killing the rest of the game.
---
It's even worse when you realize the events focus on the worst parts of the game, instead of actual good content.
---
Legendary facepalm.
---

---
What's next? Angry player tonic?
---
Oh wait.
---
You misspelled "fan service".
---
Is this like how Mobius Final Fantasy pops up, "You have been playing XX hours. Please take a break"?
---
They're in full pivot mode. All bets are off. We know nothing except that things have changed.
---
what? story never said that elder dragons are immortal, as with any other being like the gods or spirits of the wild. even other liches. as opposed to joko, who was in fact truly immortal
---
I hear two voices. One echoy in the background, softer, and one less-echoey (both echo to some degree).
---
How I hear it is:
---
(-ie .. do you) Come (come come) Come (come come) Draaaaa kaaaaaar .... (you are safe, safe) Do you waaaant to, to survive?
---
First word sounds like either die or why. Why makes more sense "why do you come, you are safe." underlining the more prominent "come, come, do you want to survive?"
---
The "Draaa kaaar" may be something else that's similar, though, as it's rather out of place.
---
I'd put my cards into Drakkar, as Wiki states that it shares whispers of Jormag.
---
Yeah you are right, must be a troll trying to attract some bad rep to the tournament... 
---
Just report
---
And yet there are some "almost always people who don't pay attention or think about the story" who are like "elder dragons are so boring! Give us a different thing than you literally said GW2 was going to be focused on!"
---
Yeah, it does seem like Quaggan and Kodan were targeted without any real choice, and I don't really know how to reason around that. For some reason, he seems to want to subjugate (Grawl), corrupt (Quaggan/Kodan), or challenge (major races).  But then we also saw the Risen "agreeing" to only take the Hylek's chosen champions instead of swarming the village entirely. I can't tell how much we're supposed to read into those personal story missions.
---
As far as Aurene goes, I can't imagine she'll only be around for a cameo or two. She's too pivotal to the Elder Dragon story for that. I mean, the idea that Kralk mentions "mother," means that Elder Dragons have natural life cycles. Aurene technically ascended to some point we're currently identifying as "Elder Dragon," but that doesn't necessarily mean she's at the same level as the others. There could be more stages before Aurene gets there. So there's room for her to be around without being *completely* overpowered.
---
It almost seems like Jormag likes the Norn above all other races, and I imagine it has to do with their culture surrounding power, glory, and the hunt. All three of those are things Jormag aspires to, from what the story has told us so far.
---
They remind me a lot of the original GW1 mesmer outfits.
---
On the other hand, the majority of villain groups in GW2 have been one of the following:
---
* Misogynists (Flame Legion, Sons of Svanir)
---
* Mindless and enslaved (dragon minions, Forged, Awakened, arguably nightmare court)
---
* Unrepentant racists and supremacists who'd sell their own kin to slavery for the chance to kill their bitter rival species (centaurs, renegades, separatists, White Mantle, Nightmare Court, arguably Inquest).
---
So doing the opposite would rather be refreshing tbh, since most enemy factions feel like they come out of a SJW fiction blog.
---
Yep, I can keep destroyer orange for awhile longer at least.
---
Hai, so with the help of /u/Artharia with the given sound files, I tried to figure out the voices and try to fix their orders or at least for some as all of them are loop sounds so a lot of them just start randomly from the middle making it pretty confusing to listen to sometimes, so I had to cut them on silent parts and re-order them maybe that way they make more sense.
---
Strange to me, because they kind of sound similarly to Glint, but not that way too much. So no idea personally. It does fit the Jormag theme imo, as the voices kinda want to give the "you are stronger with me" vibe which is fitting for Jormag, but could be simply just one of his or... her(?) champion, like Drakkar (afaik it's not dead, right?) or another.
---
I thought Torment was infused with the world's magic when the Realm of Torment was unhinged into Tyria back during Nightfall.
---
Or maybe a "crazy fan" who try to advertise the tournament and don't even think about that what he is doing could be bad. You know "trying to help, but making it even worse". 
---
However, fortunately it stopped now.
