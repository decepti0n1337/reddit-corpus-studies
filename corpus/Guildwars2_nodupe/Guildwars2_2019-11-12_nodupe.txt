Good thing salmonella comes from salmon /s.

---
---
Solid argument. Go sue them.
---
you should feel lucky you guys still can buy mount skin ingame using gold. in China server, mount skin is only sold on a seperate webstore where you HAVE to spend real money in the meanwhile i have more than 20K gold sitting in my wallet doing nothing.  be grateful
---
I lol'd
---
Id love a code we dont have a quiznos anywere near my town
---
I would love a code thank you :)
---
Ping?
---
Could I get two for my family?  I already have one.
---
ok boomer
---
Dude's right though. We got a whole cluster of people whose sole reason for existing on this sub is to shit on the game at every opportunity. It's genuinely scary.
---
The Dredge commander isn't token? Really? Come on, most of them are simply given a cursory acknowledgement.
---
Hi, I would really love a code if you still have any left &lt;3
---
If it is not  to late, I would LOVE a code.
---
May I have two codes (GF and I)? It would be very kind of you!
---
Heyy if you still have any I would love one (and couple for guildies if you can spare) cheers!
---
The less ingame rewards and gemstore sales overlap, the less friction with the playerbase. Hard-won lesson from earlier experiments with the gemstore. It also mildens hesitancy to buy stuff if it's offered nowhere else. No split for the playerbase, where 'legit' players harass people who buy from the cash shop.
---
Yo! Returning player here, if you have some codes remaining I'd appreciate one ;)
---
&gt;Think about how much money you’ve lost because you pressed sell now thinking you’ll get fair pricing over the years, now add those up.
---
I think it was about 20 copper. It happened once. Then I started being patient.
---
mirage is unstopable in PVP
---
oh damn... Well you know what to get Sya this wintersday.
---
Can i have one? : ) ty
---
I'd like one too! :)
---
 Hey Rae, just in case you have a key left for Icebrood saga stuff!  No worries if they are all gone and gg.
---
How is you being impatient, the same thing as getting "scammed"?
---
No one scammed you, you just sold shit for the lowest price because the data didn't load yet. Just wait a second. Is it annoying when the TP lags? Yeah, but it's not the end of the world.
---
Learn to relax a bit. Judging from this thread, you don't do that much. Just chill.
---
Outside the topic - I really have to wonder what your build looks like xD
---
Hello, I would appreciate a code if possible, thanks
---
I would love to have two codes, if you have them to spare for mine and my daughters accounts.  if not, just one for hers.  Thanks for your efforts!!
---
Hope I didn’t miss it!
---
Better world building by a mile and a half too. The maps had cities, outposts, nomads in the north, refugees and rebels fighting against undead in the south, and the insane culture of Vabbi was the amazing fun to sift through and see how worshipping a lich king as a god would work from a human followers perspective.
---
HoT gave us Exalted and two species of Hylek, all of which were underdeveloped and a huge disappointment.
---
HoT -&gt; Better metas, more gameplay on the map because of that
---
PoF -&gt; Literally everything else. Map variety, world building, story and characters, atmosphere, enemy variety, etc.
---
Give me PoF with HoT metas and you've hit the best blend. Just make sure you give us good and challenging instanced content and balance the specs that come with it too, and you've hit 10/10.
---
Hey my dude, I'd love one if you got any left.
---
Yeah he wore it like every day.
---
May i please have a code?
---
"no one was on" "I was on a full map"
---
???
---
Pretty much, but rich people who sell expensive things do need other rich people to buy those things.
---
What's the point in having millions in rare items with the intention of selling them, if no one has enough money or items to buy those items with?
---
Thanks for doing this! You still have two codes left?
---
Do you like trees ?
---
Never forget Jalis Ironhammer.
---
That is not Steve....
---
Wait all I have to do is leave a comment and get a code? That would be awesome man.
---
um not really, what about flame legion shamans, they transform their bodies. same as norns, humans (not just avatar forms but turning into druids). there are probably more example of transform magic (like lich form, tornado,) or body enhancement like kudu
---
You rock OP! Only one code for me if you have any left!
---
Palawa Joko is the most powerful Necromancer in the world. There is *nothing* he cannot raise. ~~Gods it hurts to even type that joke out~~ Praise joko!
---
Hey I'll definitely take a code!
---
The trick to keep mechanics in check is making them balance 'on the fly'.
---
Take, for example, the [Spirit of Rejuvenation](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Rejuvenation) in GW1.
---
Rather than having a fixed amount of health that will affect equally all targets, it heals allies every second, and loses health for each ally healed. So the more target it heals, the shorter its duration.
---
When key skills are changed to have dynamic effects based on variable factors, extreme cases can be avoided.
---
I feel like we should be asking you.
---
Mutilation with fire magic is more than just a bit different than changing your hormones and whatnot. And Kudu was altered via dragon energies, ergo, "Elder Dragon level beings".
---
The rest you mention are temporary transformations that last a few minutes at best, and I was talking about permanent, no-upkeep, full fledged transformations.
---
If u could please lend me 2 i would apreciate.
---
Messaged you on Twitter.  Discord wasn't letting me for some reason.
---
It would be different if you had to *actually* play the game, you know? Like a collection.
---
I'd love one, thanks &lt;3
---
Is this like that pyramid scheme from a few months back where they want people to make Legendary Weapons for them to sell at a profit?
---
Thanks for the giveaway. May I have one code please sir.
---
I'd like one please. Thank you for your service!
---
The point isn't to sell them, the point is to have them. It's about collecting millions of gold in Legendary weapons and infusions and whatnot, and then leaving them to rot in the bank so that other players can't have fun running around with them.
---
I wouldn't mind one if you still have some !   
---
Even if not, thanks for what you're doing. Awesome.
---
I think that people were too busy being stuck in permanent loading screens to be able to play.
---
Hey, would appreciate a code since im a filthy Eu and can't rly obtain it in any other way :)
---
Gn ! &lt;3
---
TP barons essentially intercept other transactions to leech gold off the rest of players.
---
They do not need other lots of other rich people, they can instead have many players spending hours grinding to get 1 thing they really, really want that costs 1-3K.  
---
Each one of the poor grinders may not buy more than one thing, but there will be other poor grinders buying other things.
---
Basically they get lots and lost of people making gold for them.
---
Still have some?
---
So you are against op's opinion?
---
I agree, even having skills that perform a very similar role is fine so long as some of the particulars of how they work are different and interesting such as that.
---
Health cost, cooldowns, skill interaction like that, class specific resources and cooldowns, etc. it takes some effort for sure, but its far from an impossible task to keep skills varied and interesting.
---
Hey, I'll take a code. Thanks!
---
So how is it working at quiznos? Genuinely curious.
---
me please!
---
I had the highest buy order for unlimited instant repair cannister for about 750g well over a year ago. Imagine my surprise when it finally filled and I had it waiting in my TP along with 749g99s99c. I was very confused that day and looked up this issue.
---
I would like a code. I live in Europe :)
---
Ohhh!!! I’d like one as well !! Thanks for being a part of the community !
---
OP is merely asking a question, Raknel is delusional enough to call S3, PoF and S4 " milking the game with minimal effort", which has nothing to do with reality.
---
I hope I'm number 300!
---
I’d like one, thanks so much for doing this!
---
Mmm, I'm not sure but are you misunderstanding the question? Any particular box would be a combination of which expeditions you have out. But if you have a stack of 20 boxes, each with different configurations of expeditions, what would be in each one? It doesn't seem likely  that the system would keep track of the expedition settings of each box while allowing it to be a stack-able item.
---
Perhaps so!  In that case, let me keep collecting boxes and in about 100 more days I'll post some opening video or some such :P
---
I contacted ya! :)
---
How is the GW2 cash shop predatory? How are the items in the gem store “the best rewards”? They’re purely cosmetic. A mount skin doesn’t make your mount move faster, have a new attack, or do anything that the default skin doesn’t do. The mounts themselves aren’t locked behind a pay wall. The game has to make a profit somehow, and monetizing items that offer no in game advantage is the best way to do so without being predatory. 
---
Even if there were one or two mounts skins obtainable by playing the game, everyone would have them so they wouldn’t feel as special as the gem store ones and there would still be people complaining that the “best rewards” are locked behind the gem store. (Unless they made obtaining them super hard, but then you’d have people complaining about that.)
---
So what do you think the solution should be?
---
One would be nice.
---
I would like a code, please.
---
why am I getting bubble tea flashbacks?
---
I'm new to reddit and I'm unsure of how DMs work, but I hope I'll figure it out. Thanks for the codes you are giving away btw, nice of you :)
---
This isn't a metric system thing.  It's just cosmetic nonsense.
---
Really nice of you, thanks!!
---
Sent you an add on discord, I would love a code please....far far away in NZ :)
---
Can I get one? This is awesome of you, thank you!
---
"You're dumb, you'll die, and you'll leave a dumb corpse."
---
I've been on GW1since 2005, and Prophecies is my favourite campaign so far, but Nightfall's login background and music were my favourites :p
---
I replayed the POF story like 6 times. What POF was and is missing are better metas.
---
Love the maps.. still love the maps.. 
---
You know... I think with some world PVP you could make all those maps really awesome ... cough ... just saying ...
---
The desert maps are all well suited to some kind of WvW engagement with an objective to fight over. All reasonably pretty flat well except desolation ...
---
5 years playing. Not full ascended on chars. Just saying
---
Sexuality only doesn't matter if there are no relationships in the story at all.
---
If there are any relationships in the story, then sexuality matters.
---
I'll take one if you still have any left. And thank you for doing something like this for the community.
---
Quite an undertaking.  Thanks!
---
I'd love one! :)
---
May I please have a code? I appreciate it if so. Have a nice night.
---
I would like one! Thank you for doing this.
---
No, just the base mounts themselves.
---
Except my comment had literally nothing to do with his point.
---
People seem to forget that Gw2 is a video game that is meant as entertainment and nothing more. It's not a job, and it's certainly not something you're obligated to keep playing.
---
If you aren't having fun with the game or find don't find it fair, then just play a different game. There's literally tons of games out there to play instead. 
---
Wild concept, I know. Being a gamer is truly hard.
---
All the Quizno's in my area are completely closed down. I released an audible snort when I saw the email come in from Arenanet. Especially after trying so hard to get a code from Kung Fu Tea and not being able to.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You're doing God's work!
---
Northern California has very little in the way of chain stores, this is awesome! Thank you!
---
Please! Thank you!!!
---
I would like one if you have one still available. thank you
---
I could use a spare code if you still have one.  Thanks
---
Wow, this is fantastic that you're doing this.  If you're still doing it, could I snag two? One for me and for my bud who doesn't frequent the gw2 reddit.  Thank you!
---
Fair enough
---
I got my code thanks to another kind soul who posted here offering them. Thank you for doing this!
---
Added you on Discord, thanks so much for your generosity!
---
Not sure why it was titled like that on the YT vid other than for clicks, because there was nothing “revealed” rather than discussion of the process.
---
As soon as a specific item/market is mentioned it almost immediately over saturates (which they even talk about w/ legendaries).
---
TBH the discussion itself was actually pretty decent and avoided specifics except when providing examples to talk about a point.
---
If you still have any codes, I'll take two!
---
Political agenda or not, we should love more, hate less. This is a step in the right direction. The only people we should be hating are toxic people.
---
I am very interested in hearing it. Wanna take a code. Thanks
---
All you have to do is ask in chat when the place is kinda busy, which seems to be a lot. People just like killing stuff, though it can take a bit for the ones in Verdant Brink canopy.
---
Nah, this was better IMO
---
If there is still one I'd like it... Thank you either way!
---
I cant find any Quiznos here on the huehueland aka Brazil ;P the only 2 are closed :( can i get a code pls? :3 Ty!
---
Hey if you’ve got any extra, I’d love one!
---
Every single answer of yours alongside your post is the most overdramatized thing after spanish telenovelas, you’re taking this so damn far it’s nuts. 
---
It is a game and you are treating this like you just lost shit ton of money and your company is now going broke, get some fresh air or something, damn.
---
Maybe one figures that even yes if it is broken, you would know that it is broken, and act accordingly, as in slow the fuck down.
---
It would require a lot of work to rebrand and redesign guild wars. Because korean mmorpgs are designed to draw people into internet cafes and pay by the hour for as many hours as possible without having much substance.
---
Side note: My character looks high.
---
But masteries are required to craft legendary, and some of us casual players are, and I readily admit this, not so good. It's easy enough to get ascended but if I can't get masteries then I really don't have anything to look for. What's the point of doing metas and gathering materials if you can't save them to craft legendaries later? And besides, if the noobs are so bad, won't they die quickly and you can ignore them and play with the 'competent players' for the rest of the fight?
---
I thought I was playing a game, not running a company, I guess I had it wrong all along
---
Hey!
---
I didn't know about this event, but now i kind of understand all the memes that has been flowting around, haha. I'am in EU, I collect minipets and would love to get two codes, one for myself and my sisters son!
---
Thank you!
---
I would be happy to have one as well, if you have some left. Thank you for thinking of the community!
---
Truth. And thanks to those random people who come out to help when you ask on map chat.
---
im trans, you definitely can do body alteration procedures such as fat transfers, bone shaving, implants, cosmetic surgeries. - all without being on cross-hormones therapy. only if you get genital reconstruction then you need to "resupply" hormones externally cause you no longer produce them. but that can still be testosterone if you want (or cant take estrogen for medical reasons). as for legal gender recognition - depends on country
---
Added you on dis*
---
every in game mount comes with 1 skin for FREE \s
---
You’re part of the problem.
---
It hasn’t been like this for 7 years.  Maybe 5?
---
[But good luck with it changing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/amw4yf/i_appreciate_the_discount_and_all_but_anet_you/)
---
i wish we had mount armor to get in-game for our standard mount skins.
---
I don't think they are consistent in this instance.  The obvious thing to compare mounts to are gliders.  There are 3 glider skins available in game, the legendary backpieces.  No legendary mount analog.
---
Uh helllo
---
I'm pretty sure you're out of codes, but if you do pls hit me up and ty!
---
I Have added you on Discord whowantblood#0489 for a code =\]
---
To clarify, you are implying your getting downvoted is some scheme to suppress your tin foil hat theory rather than actual downvotes on a comment that has nothing to do with the topic at hand?
---
I don't think it's the box. Doesn't the background start to blur and turn brown?
---
Shoot
---
I kept forgetting that cities were a thing in both expansions, because they're so bland and featureless. Great architecture, but that's about it. So, to me, HoT actually worked better than PoF when it came to culture because it played to Guild Wars 2's strengths of open, dynamic and dangerous maps, with a few places for a brief respite, like the Tangled Depths and Verdant Brink outposts.
---
I also think the HoT atmosphere was better... largely because of the repetition and grind for the mastery system, and map-specific currencies. It had us constantly in the jungle, learning and getting used to the place and just plunge into the world. PoF, meanwhile... The analogy I keep thinking of is "like a stone skipping across water". It's built to be buzzed through too fast, with too little to be worth sticking around and sinking into the world. It's a problem Guild Wars 2 really suffers from in general, though.
---
Yeah, I hate the microtransaction store. Not a fan. I get it, but not a fan.
---
But Prime Access is just skipping the grind to get the stuff. You can still get everything without paying *and* without having to rely on getting paid currency ingame to buy them with (which I find is a flimsy justification for something "being obtainable ingame").
---
I tried to message you on discord but it’s not working, I would really appreciate a code as there are no Quiznos anywhere near here for hours. Thanks for doing this even if I don’t get one!
---
Wow Am I late?
---
Not sure if you still have any, but this is so cool of you friend! I'd love one if you have any spare :)
---
Got one for me, darling? Davy McDave.8532 is my gw2 acc.
---
I cant say no to free goodies. :P That is, if there are any still available.
---
Heeeere plsss
---
Which also means he probably wouldn't care about the advantages of scepter, which while better for sure, never really feels very fun to use.  The biggest downside of bow is that half the skills root you and none of them hit as hard as they feel like they should, but if playing for fun, why not?  And they're not any problems that ele staff don't also have as a DPS weapon in open world for the most part.
---
Rev needs more villain legends; only have 2 out of 6 at the moment.  If it gets Greatsword it should get Svanir which would also fit thematically with this season.  Would be considerably more interesting to see the Rev pull corrupted magic from one of Jormag's minions than have Rev channel boring Jora or Aesgir
---
Yeah for sure, and I'll never encourage anyone to not play what's fun to them.  There's a difference between knowing the meta, understanding the meta and why it is how it is... and actually following the meta.  It's good to be informed, but if you're not having a good time, there's no point at all.
---
A Vizier Khilbron, Master Togo, or Razah spec with Scepter Focus for Rev would be pretty awesome
---
Two would be amazing 
---
minipet for my Main and this + Cheater Pof for my  twink hell Yeah
---
Ok so, I believe I've played enough of the game to kinda get a feel of stats and 'builds' but my question is: Sure, I absolutely understand optimal builds for specific goals, for instance for insane tankiness you build one way or for pure DPS you build another, but in terms of playstyle, is there really any downside to just building towards your own personal playstyle? For instance Rangers have a Signet which passively grants 25% MS (and more during active) but as far as I can tell, builds favor the Signet which grants toughness. Is there really that much of a downside if I just prefer more MS over said toughness?
---
Also how do you pronounce "Signet"? Is it "sig-nit" or "sign-it"?
---
If there's any left I'd like one!
---
If there are characters saying they're gay, just to say they're gay, you're right. Period. The other guy decided to get huffy and ignore your point (ironically, being unreasonable), but it's just a flat fact. 
---
Idk if it's just your opinion that characters do that that, though-- Idk that much about this game's characters. If they do that, duh AF you're right. I'd imagine a non-token gay character would simply happen to be gay. Seems like Joko is an example of that.
---
are you still giving codes on reddit?  
---
I don't have a twitter or discord ;\_;
---
There isn't any Quiznos in my area of town, code would be awesome!
---
If you have any left, a code for me, and if you can spare another for my bestie :)
---
Super nice what you're doing. Would love to get one.
---
I hate to say.. but the artist should watermark their work. Something that good will be stolen without credit.
---
I could use one :)
---
I approve.
---
FREEE CODEEEE!! Thank you man!
---
I was upset about Aurene's wings being gem store and not story reward. It's a skin that's part of the main story that I already bought. Nope. Gem store.
---
I will never understand why people love running around in that circle but will complain about no new raids or other repeating content thats way better.
---
Living in Belgium, so no codes to get for me. I'd be happy if I got one from you.
---
The only downside to playing your way is that when you come to an instance or event that require you to use specific mechanics. At that point you will need to switch from what you are accustomed too. The actual problem is that most of the story and openworld is extremely easy so players don't necessarily make "their own" builds, but just bad builds i.e. ones with contradictory traits, unused skills etc. 
---
So in your example. Signet of Hunt is great for when you are buy yourself, just exploring killing things etc. But if you are a in fractral/dungeon/raid where you are close with your party moving around extra fast isn't actually helping. (It's more of a PvP signet since running faster is always useful, and Players are more likely to use Blocking skills than random mobs, so it's activation has frequent use.) Signet of Stone is super powerful and useful since it makes you ignore damage for a while. 
---
Sig-net like a [signet ring.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/signet)
---
Same happens for signets.
---
Notice it all the time on my guardian and it even happens when you change maps/zones because the game loads you in based on your saved build.
---
GW2 wasn't f2p back then, and it isn't today.
---
I got a gigabit connection and I pay extra for a personal route. If $300+ can’t buy me a proper response time, nothing in Earth can! They are fucking liable for any and all losses caused by their flawed system, and there’s no amount of downvotes that can make it less so.
---
My point exactly. Welcome to America EAsoft, enjoy your fucking stay!
---
Would love a code! Thanks :)
---
They could actually fix DH bow rather easily.
---
Just lower the cast time of the auto then tweak damage.
---
Then take the kneeling restriction off the 2 but make it glow allot more as a warning.
---
Then swap the CD's of the #3 and #4 around and give the reflecting shot something to make it worth the extra CD duration.
---
Then tada you have decent damage with about the same or less spike and more up time of the symbol.
---
Wow, thank you so much for being an awesome person lol. I would love a code if there any left.
---
Oh, I don't doubt it. I just wish someone was there voicing the counterpoint...
---
Guard could also get dagger as far as existing weapons go.
---
Also don't forget the coding to use spears on land has been in the game since original launch, they have just never made abilities for it which would require nothing but reusing some animations and tacking numbers on it.
---
Scrapper is less Heal-y and more Barrier Spam.
---
hey dude, i would love to get one if there's any of it left
---
[removed]
---
I would love one for me and my partner :) I'm in Australia, so we don't have Quiznos :X
---
&gt; But masteries are required to craft legendary, 
---
Astralaria, Hope, Chuka, and Nevermore.
---
&gt;and some of us casual players are, and I readily admit this, not so good.
---
Then get good. 
---
&gt;But if I can't get masteries then I really don't have anything to look for. 
---
"It's too hard to interact with a gray star on the map and do a few achievements"
---
&gt;What's the point of doing metas and gathering materials if you can't save them to craft legendaries later?
---
Get good.
---
cheers man
---
Imagine doing that to a character that you main but wants to change the name, at least for me needing to literally max out bag slot all over again, redo all the maps including ls + redo all the story again for it to be finished + finishing all the story dungeons in order to be able to open explorable dungeon. No Thank You. Also now for that matter of fact templates are character bound, not spending another 2900 gems to max that out. a whooping price tag of 800 gems can make my life a lot easier and avoid all of the things I said above. ofc situations differ from one to another. Plenty of people probably feel the price tag is fair and are willing to buy it, for those who feel other wise... well you can buy character slot. options are there so pick your poison.
---
I would love two of them! One for my fiancée and one for myself! :)
---
Thank you very much for doing this!
---
I would like one if you have any left :)  Thank you for doing this!
---
It has happened more than once for a few silvers because nowhere in the ToS does it say “hey our TP server sucks and takes 20 secs to load, don’t press sell prior to loading”
---
Few silvers every day for 7 years out of 1 player is still thousands of silvers. Discounting it as “only a few silvers” doesn’t make it OK.
---
and then you'd have the crybabies like with khan-ur items from last episode, cause nobody would drop them
---
May I have 3 codes please?
---
Because RPers hurt nobody. People playing the economy makes the economy work less effectively for everyone else.
---
Give me one please 😔
---
Crafting is mandatory, and also quite profitable.
---
The advantage of power is it has spikes of damage every 15-60 seconds, depending on the build. This is called bursts. These bursts usually have incredibly high dps, and lower dps in between. You control when these spikes of damage happen, so you can control when you get a crap ton of damage, whether that be a specific buff, or trying to pump as much dps as possible quickly.
---
Condi slowly stacks up conditions, so it is not bursty (except arguably condi firebrand). This means your dps slowly increases overtime, and eventually higher than a power class. Some of the meta classes also apply torment (more dps when enemy is moving) and confusion (more dps when enemy is attacking), which can proc nicely on some bosses.
---
You will want power for open world, fractals and many raids. Most of open world  are weak, so little condi ramp will happen. Bursting them with quick power damage will melt them instantly. There are also structures that may take no condi damage, which will feel awful. Open world trash also rarely moves or attacks, so torment and confusion will be trash most of the time. But really, it doesn’t matter much, so play condi if you’d like.
---
Fractals are all about burst as well. They have many small groups of enemies that you want to burst down one after the other, and cc bars that give the exposed buff you’ll want to pour all your dps into. With a whole team giving all their burst, most enemies will melt in seconds. You’ll also have team buffs increasing your power damage most likely.
---
In raids, many bosses have phases or mechanics that condi cleanse. Phases and cleanses means your condis will reset and you’ll have to ramp up all over again. For instance, gorseval goes invincible every 33%. Gorseval also needs power bursts since you want to dps quick so you can phase before the insta wipe. Another example is KC, where you have a designated burn phase which you get a dps boost you need to quickly dps in a limited time of 15’seconds ish.
---
The raids bosses that heavily favor condi are: Matthias, cairn, SH, Dhuum, and Largos. You’ll have an especially bad time playing power in SH and largos.
---
I think you inadvertently just explained why GW2 isn't doing well compared to those others... Zero new content..
---
 you are doing that too much. try again in 2 minutes.

I'm pretty sure its the moronic time limits on posting here.. friggin joke of a reddit.. Worst reddit i ever had the displeasure of using tbh..

I'm genuinely happy for her, and I think it's a great hire for Bungie. The Chak Gerent and Triple Trouble meta events might be my favorites in the game.
---
I’m just gonna quote my comment, I think you missed a bit:
---
”Pay2win doesn’t mean that you *have* to pay to win, but that you have an advantage in paying a small buck.”
---
Thank you for helping out the community!
---
Tyvm
---
Well why not? Nothing wrong about accepting treats from a stranger. GHΘΣT#5953
---
I would like a code!
---
I would like one please once you start handing out again
---
I feel like I'm witnessing a GW2 Karen in action, losing their mind after grabbing a fistful of change in a transaction, dropping some quarters on the floor and the quarters disappear into a vent in the floor nearby or something.
---
Just wait a few seconds. It's not that hard.
---
Another experienced dev bites the dust.
---
I would not having one of those codes if you still have a spare.  Thank you!
---
If you activate the aviator's box and then mount up before toggling it off your arms stay stuck up, if you don't have post processing enabled the sepia filters don't turn on either, also i'm the one that placed that box, MADE IT TO REDDIT WOO! \~PS: thanks for comin to that meta train &lt;3
---
If possible, I would like three codes.  :3 I love you.
---
This was two days ago, and it happened at random after chest 4. It wore off after a bit, though, without another box. This has been happening at random.
---
They could also consider a fourth traitline with say 4-6 specializations you can select from it which are not based on class, but universal. A way to tweak every/any class. It would add a new depth and dimension to class building. As suggested by someone else below, they could be gotten via the LS. So free for everyone... If you log in to open the story. 
---
Some of these things could include less combat related stuff and more general play things. Movement speed increases, currency gain, luck, mixed in with stat boosts, weapon specific cool down or damage changes, higher tolerance of certain effects. Buffs against specific classes. Increased healing. Racial traits and skills. There are a lot of ways to do it, and endless things that could be done with the trait system to make builds more individual using the same format as the elite build system.
---
Hey, I'm from Australia so yeah, a bit for from a Quiznos!
---
Would love a code!
---
I would take a code if you still got one
---
lmao
---
If you have one pls send
---
In theory the Skyscale is a legendary mount. It's not a skin.  What you're saying is you'd rather have a skin than an actual mount. THere's only one glider, so the only thing they can give you is skins. Instead, we got a beetle mount and a sky scale mount, new mounts, not just skins for them.
---
Given the option of the new mounts or the skins, I'll take the mounts any day.
---
if possible, could I get a code for me and my bf?
---
Thanks for don't this!
---
It requires so many people to do it and only has 1 minute of grace before failing. Preset is the only time I can play but we can never get enough people to actually beat it. Not to mention the other time slots having a large time investment compared to the other hard world bosses Teq and Karka queen. Having to arrive 15 minutes early to join what is usually the only instance that is attempting the boss, doing the long escort, syncing up the bosses. I wouldn't mind if the second chance for the event didn't need to redo the escort. I like it, it's fun but the failure for that event feels like it costs so much effort that I have a hard time wanting to do it. I wouldn't mind as much if we had like 2 minutes to kill the wurms or if we didn't need to escort the Asura back to each point. At least on the NA servers.
---
server only determines your wvw situation
---
But Guild Wars 1 did have a cash shop that offered, among other things, skill pack unlocks. And Guild Wars 1 wasn't free to play you had to buy it. If you bought, when it was new, Prophecies, Factions, Nightfall and Eye of the North, you were absolutely in for $150, in what was essentially a 2 year period.   Won't comment on the other games because I don't play them.
---
It sounds like you don't need to transfer since tranfers are only related to WvW and the events you mentioned are all PvE. Save your money.
---
Capitalism bad /s
---
I have personally unlocked all of the mount skins ingame, and haven't spent a single euro on them, simply with just gold -&gt; gem conversion, farming gold in this game is not really that hard not time consuming as people might make you believe.  [https://i.imgur.com/3cj9MlW.png](https://i.imgur.com/3cj9MlW.png)   
---
Just figure which farming method works for you, exchange to gems when its cheapest and wait for sales/discounts to buy.
---
My favorite moment during the story was the climax of the "Hero's Journey". 
---
We have been killed, we failed over and over again, being a step behind and barely even made it to the final fight.
---
In the final fight we barely held on, Aurene evened the odds somewhat, but then, finally, the big emotional payoff:
---
**I AM FIRE, I AM WAR! WHAT ARE YOU?**
---
*Still standing.*
---
Killing blow. 
---
I'm getting goosebumps even now when reliving it typing it out. Such a great buildup, such a great payoff.
---
In a game that is not explicitly *about* economics? Definitely. The purpose of a game is for people to have fun. Any system that allows some players to reduce the fun that other players are having, against their will, is a bad system, and should be changed.
---
time to start making bets who leaves the studio next
---
You don't need to transfer for PvP content because of the megaserver structure but can you tell us your real world country location and which server you are on?
---
I used to play on EY server from the UK and I finally moved to US server recently after living in Australia for 2 years and I made a huge difference. The ping is better and the world is more populated during my evenings. There are also large Australian guilds. 
---
Perhaps your issue is selecting the wrong region for your time zone.
---
I don't recall them saying you don't need to wait either, you made an assumption how it works and demand they do it how you assumed as if they promised you that. It is fucking dumb but there is no breach of contract.
---
Bounty trains still happen, but they're not massively profitable compared to other content. Meta trains don't have to happen, because metas are on a timer, so you just look up the timer on a timer site and go there and there will be people doing it. I've done a handful of metas this week, why do I need a train.
---
There are no more servers, per se. The game is on a mega server. That means using timer sites and the LFG tool (to taxi to an active server) is the best way to play the game.
---
If you still have any left, could i get one please?
---
I live an entire continent away from the nearest Quiznos. Please send help D:
---
No where did they say they would stop you from selling it for less than its value they let you sell it at any price. Does it suck and they should have a warning? yes. is it scamming? No
---
Would love to have one for my wife and I!  I sent you a friends request on Discord.  Sutarion#3703
---
I could use two if its okey.
---
Go out of your way and find a guild that fits YOU .
---
I guess you already know this from WoW but again , just a reminder .
---
What's to spin? We have no idea if "all is well" (however you define well I guess), but people do move to other companies all the time. Nature of the industry.
---
As for Bungie? Well, after the latest expansion, they need all the help they can get. It was not great.
---
I know, it's terrible
---
gratulations, until now you shitposted the most here
---
There's now more room for elite specs that are viable in specific situations, given build and equipment templates.
---
&gt; Signet of mercy
---
Well for races who don't pop out big groups of babies at a time you need the majority to be straight to make sure the race doesn't die out.
---
BuT yOu cAn ConvErt gEms tO gOld, thats exaaaactly the same as playing and receiving a reward
---
Ah, man. Making me comment on reddit for the first time in ages..
---
Take it off?
---
 """"TP barons"""" are afraid of this info getting more traction, and this is why the same barons talk about it on twitch... seems like a logical move...200IQ
---
People fail to see that GW2 has absolutely NO future. The sings are there since Mike Z said that they have no plans for expansion. Veteran Devs keep leaving, even the CEO left. If you think that this wont impact the game, just have a look at build templates feature. I am starting to doubt that they will manage to finish Icebrood Saga. Maintenance mode is probably way closer that we though.
---
I’d love one for me and my wife but I think you might be out already :(
---
If it's at other players' expense, then it's not worth it. Some players would very much like to be able to hang out in Lion's Arch and PK any newbs they come across. Most players would not enjoy that being an option.
---
But my fun isn't because other people are hurt. It's because I get to sell some of my stuff and I can also pay lower prices on the tp.
---
No it was always known since Mordremoth that powerful beings like dragons or gods can consume the magic of a dead dragon. Like Balthazar and the bloodstone or Vlast or Aurenes egg at the end of HoT.
---
I would not mind a code.
---
If you still have them
---
Focus on getting level 80 exotic gear for now with stats that work for your build. When you've finalized you build and become comfortable with it get ascended gear. The exotics are usually pretty easy to craft, or buy if you have HoT, and they'll be enough for a long time.
---
So what you're saying is that ppl who submit designs essentially get "paid with exposure?"
---
Ahhh. I always miss these!  Thanks for the generosity though!
---
Hope you dont dun out :)
---
Depends on what you want to do.
---
There is A LOT of story content for level 80. I'm just working through HoT at the moment, hit 80 a long time ago.
---
Are you talking about contracted designers? Because this is not fanart.
---
Did you get a good night's sleep? And do you still have more codes? ;P
---
&gt; But my fun isn't because other people are hurt.
---
It may not be fun *because* other people are hurt, but it is at least fun *indifferent* to other people being hurt. If someone drives their car through a crowd, it really doesn't matter whether or not their motivation was "it was a shortcut."
---
Would love a code, wish there were more Quiznos around! Thanks for helping people out, either way!
---
You're the best!!
---
Does this work for europe as well, or is it region locked? If not, then I’d also like one :)
---
Blizzard is fine with people selling stuff thats inspired by their games as long as its not a direct copy of the assets (just search for etsy). Not sure what ANets stance is, I imagine similar.
---
&gt;Did anyone even KNOW he was gay until this post lmao.
---
That's the whole point though. Token characters *are* visible, because they're used to emphasize "hey look how inclusive we are!" A character that is "silently" queer (or anything else, but let's stay on topic), that exists for a reason but just do happens to be queer *as well*, it's the antithesis of a token character.
---
Crafting is by far one of the best ways to generate gold in this game. The only caveat is that you'll have to invest a lot of gold upfront to purchase mats.
---
The ROI (return of interest, or profit) usually hovers around 20-30% of the investment, meaning that for every 1000 gold you put in, ultimately you can get 1200-1300 gold back.
---
Considering the ordering of mats and actual crafting takes an hour or two, you're looking at 100g+/hour, which is pretty damn nice
---
This, if the people on this sub would just pull their heads out of their asses for two seconds where everything smells like shit and they blame it on Anet and GW2, they’d see that Destiny 2 isn’t exactly a paragon of gaming and has issues of it’s own. If a dev was leaving Anet for another company because they felt that GW2 was dying, you’d think they’d jump to a company that had a better reputation/track record than Bungie.
---
So, reductio ad absurdum is the best argument you have to make?
---
Any left?
---
That was one example, just through the personal story we see a lot of very powerful rituals (you transform into an avatar of Balthazar during a Priory storyline mission at some point IIRC?).
---
My point was just to say that magic is pretty fucking powerful in Tyria.
---
Aw, shame. She's a badass! Best of luck to her in her new job though.
---
Got any proof they hurt others?
---
Hi! I'd love a code if its not too late.
---
Yes lol... it is not weird to leave a games company. Sometimes things just get stagnant and it’s time to move on.  It’s almost always personal, and almost never about any drama about the company or their games.
---
Of course We all use trading bots, that's why we spend hours doing stuff in excel and testing theories and drop rates for others... /s
---
Yes it was known that dragons eat magic, but it had never even been suggested that aurene could suck up all that magic and be cool with it, until she suddenly could
---
And yet, there *are* people out there with massive stockpiles of items, far more than they could ever use themselves, purely as a way to stock wealth. That seems to be their "score tally," how much pointless wealth they can accumulate for no other end than to have more wealth.
---
I've spent 2500 hours farming the mst profitable farms in game and never got a BL Key.
---
If you still have codes left, I'd love one for me and one for my girlfriend :)  
---
Thank you very much!
---
&gt;, because I can think of a number of them. 
---
Examples?
---
Yet these are also the people who will buy your lucky drops for high value on the tp, precisely because they have such value.
---
You can't sell stuff at a good price if nobody is willing to shell out that coin :)
---
You obviously have no clue how our legal system works. Welcome to the US, the land of the free!
---
Why do you want to buy skins for the mounts? I've never even dyed mine. And I do spend a few dollares in gemshop every now and then.
---
GW2 Gameplay - even a still frames are hard to watch and/or understand.
---
I don't see what prevents you from putting a buy order at the same price I would.
---
Blink twice if an evil TP Baron has you at gunpoint whenever you open the TP window!
---
Based on your comment you can go suck donkey balls.
---
Only if you are in WvW against your will. WvW is an optional game mode, if you enter it, you are entering it then you are entering it to engage in a PvP mode, with all that entails. You do not automatically have to engage in WvW activities on Tyrian maps. 
---
Players who buy this game as the action/adventure game it is marketed as should not opt in to a PvP economic system, that is not a system that best serves that core player experience. If there was a separate economic game that did not in any way interact with the action/adventure players or their economy, then that would be fine. 
---
Now, some would argue that the game forces players who don't want to WvW into that mode, to acquire items that can only be found there, and I would agree, the game should not do this.
---
&gt;Thief might get boomerang-style mainhand axe or blackjack-style mainhand mace.
---
This is exactly what I have been thinking as someone who loves thief. Only problem is that the 3 skill will have to be unique for every offhand combo. I'm pretty sure that's why the existing elite specs both use a two-handed weapon. I could see a hammer "bruiser" spec come out but probably not any of the other two-handers. I could also see potential in a torch focused condi spec (though it would have similar development issues to the aforementioned main-hand weapons).
---
As others have said, the world you are on only matters for joining WvW. When you are in PvE you are on the Megaserver System in which every player of every world in the region (EU or NA) are playing together. The problem with that is that new instances of those maps need to be created if others are full. Which means that you can either join an instance which was just created and seems empty. This is by far not a normal thing that happens all the time.
---
However, if you want to do Meta trains or Bounty trains then don't wait for others to do that for you. Pop an LFG and bring people to you instead of waiting for them.
---
Don't worry, the precursor looks way better
---
1. I don’t have a Volvo
---
2. I don’t wear acrylic
---
3. I defo don’t have the kids
---
4. I’m not speaking to the manager
---
If you've got a spare one I'll be happy to take it off your hands :)
---
Or you know it can be both.
---
I want my 10 gold!
---
well, you just compared playing a video game with driving a car through a crowd of human beings...
---
Hey, as I'm from Germany no Quiznos exists here, can you send me two codes? One for my GF and one for me. 
---
You are the best for giving away these codes
---
You gest but the difference is entirely psychological. From a game design point of view its all about making you spend time playing content. Whether thats using a drop rate probability of 1% in order to make you run a dungeon 100 times, dropping a token with each boss kill, having 3 bosses per dungeon and pricing each mount at 300 tokens,  having setting drops so you get 1g on average per run and then selling mounts for 100g or in case of gw2 you get about 1.5g per dungeon run 400 gems for a random mount, 400gems cost 144g. 
---
In all cases you running a dungeon 100 times for a mount skin.... whats the difference ? 
---
sure running it 100 times and finally getting that random drop might feel satisfying but like I said that's entirely psychological, in the end you still had to run the dungeon 100 times just like everyone else and just like you'd have to do in each other reward design. 
---
now dont get me wrong, feeling good is important so if you enjoy random drops then obviously play games that give you that. My point here is dont assume other people dont know what they're doing for liking something else because at the end of the day everything has its advantages and disadvantages. By using tokens/gold a game can spread effort around. Rather then repeating the same dungeon 100 times I can say do 10 different dungeons 10 times each which is also satisfying to some who dont like repeating the same content over and over again. It also allows for things like forgetting about the reward itself and focus on enjoying the game. I can just go and play whatever I feel like for a couple of weeks and still end up with getting a new skin if thats what I want. I personally love that freedom!
---
Probably too late? :)
---
Is it because of it's in the Plains of Ashford, a zone that is levels 1 to **15**?
---
As a gay dude myself, I think this whole discussion is pointless. There are good and bad examples of gay characters in fiction (movie, books and games). Same way as there are bad examples for straight characters in the same media. I myself have no problem when a character is hinted to be gay. However, I do have a problem with it when "being gay" is the only noticable trait a character has. But this is not happening in GW2. So no, non of these characters is a token gay in any way or form.
---
But I am also one of these guys, who don't need to have every skin color, culture and sexuality represented in one work of art to enjoy it. Like many other people think is necessary. If it fits and makes sense? Sure, do whatever you like with your characters. But just forcing someone gay, a black person, a strong independent woman and an Asian character into a movie because otherwise, you will feel the wrath of some communities, is just plain stupid.
---
The fact that it isn’t explicitly mentioned in the ToS makes the company liable. Not too late to jump on the train.
---
Nobody, what's your point? The economy is shared by all game modes, players do not have the option of opting out of it if they want to offload items that the do not need at reasonable prices, or acquire items that they do not have. 
---
I mean, if they provided vendors that carried every item on the TP at fair prices and offered TP prices to buy items off your hands, then you might have a point, but that's not currently an option.
---
I'd love to get a code.
---
dont you think its a little condescending and disrespectful towards people who lost loved ones by someone driving them over on purpose?
---
But a lot of what you say is untrue. For example, flipping drives prices down and also works as a gold sink. There are only benefits to this. People pay lower prices for stuff and there is less inflation.
---
If its still possible)
---
Would love a code, you're doing gods work &lt;3
---
omg gw2onces follow me
---
Or they dont care about money anymore. Most barons have millions of gold, they already have everything they will ever need in game, and they can buy everything that will get introduced as well. Some of them care about data/ research, teaching other ppl, helping the community grow... Consider this point. Gw2 market is so big, that not even a group of top 100 richest players can contribute even a 1% of total volume, supply and demand.
---
&gt; battle royales
---
Southsun Survival called, they want their players back
---
&gt; GW3 
---
You misspell OW2 ;)
---
And there you already got the point. It's not a reward as long as it is not tied to a specific task. Just buying something is incredibly stupid and makes the game a "job". Also, it allows content to be genereic because it's not tied to anything logically. It's just an incredibly worse way to spread things that should be rewards for tasks or designed as drops.
---
gw2 = murica?
---
I've been playing Destiny every single day for about a year now, basically ever since Guild Wars 2 visibly slowed down. So it's really good that developers which created great content in a game i mained are now moving to make great content in a game i currently love and main.
---
On the other hand, it's a bittersweet thing, because i still want GW2 to thrive, and while one, two, or even 10 people leaving won't make a huge difference, it's still bit of a bummer seeing the talent leave.
---
Can I have?
---
I would love a code! Thank you for doing this!
---
Are there still 1 or 2 codes left? ☺
---
(One for me, 1 for my boyfriend)
---
So what's the reference about?
---
&gt; For example, flipping drives prices down and also works as a gold sink. There are only benefits to this.
---
Lol, no.
---
&gt;People pay lower prices for stuff and there is less inflation.
---
No, people pay the maximum possible price for things, because the lowest possible prices are bought up by flippers and then sold off at a higher price. Whatever profits they make are an amount that they pocketed at the expense of at least one of the two other parties involved in that transaction.
---
EU here, thus late to the party.. Cant log in to Discord right now.. But even if the chances are small, if there would be a code still left, i would really appreciate that! No need to rush though i'll stay way back in the line ;) And thank you for making so many players happy! You are awesome!
---
That's just assumption, just like mine. I guess we will never know for sure.
---
No. Do you think that having an action game in which people can die is condescending and disrespectful towards people who lost loved ones by violence? An example is an example, nothing more.
---
These news kind of worry me about the future of guildwars 2. The game might have already reached it's peak and now maybe declining.
---
At the moment Bungie should be one of the few game developers, which have a positive reputation. And as far as I know, was Destiny a pretty big hit before the seperated and has become with their new bought freedom even more popular. In terms of game development they seem to go into the direction of Digital Extremes, which probably is atm the most reputable Dev.
---
Nvm, you don't seem to know much about this stuff. I dunno why I bothered.
---
Ok so to follow your arguments. TP is optional too, and by using it you engage in pvp economic system. There is a separate economic game, farming by yourself. TP is branded as a market between players, it's always been the case. If you don't expect players to make gold from it you clearly don't use your brain.
---
I mean you take build templates as an example when it’s clearly been developed mostly with MO as CEO and most of the devs that left in the past few month still at ANET. 
---
Maybe the company is collapsing, I have no idea but there’s such a thing as getting bored in your job after a few years and wanting new things, that’s why most services job have a 3-5y turnover
---
Seems that TheTopTens has some sort of level system and level 15 is named Legendary Defender of Ascalon.
---
Fair enough.
---
Assuming everyone on an international forum is from the US is one of the most ‘Murican thing ever.
---
I'm saying I don't want the kneeling restriction gone. I like the idea of being forced to stop moving temporarily and getting rewarded for it. The problem is the lack of reward, not the necessity to stop moving.
---
If joko kills you and brings you back, did you really die?
---
I would be very happy to get a code, no quiznos in my country
---
You can play unranked as for now until he reach rank 20, rank 20 takes on avg 54 unranked games
---
Sending me a code could would be awesome!
---
ah, finally you are admitting that all those evil tp barons putting up the highest buy order are paying you fair prices and offering you the lowest sales around when you need some items.
---
Yet that research always ends up on reddit and the wiki :hmm: if we wanted info to stay locked, it would be.
---
No. We've had chairs from Wing 6 and 7 and those were rewarded for CMs, not luck or Gaeting Crystals. We've also, more recently, had the rock out emote.
---
If you include skins as cosmetics, which they are, we've had plenty of them throughout the entire span of LS3 up to the Prologue.
---
It is literally the point. You said "I can't buy it at the same low price". Yes you can. That's called putting a buy order and waiting.
---
You. You do.
---
The MMO I've mostly moved onto (spend about 1 week back per new release in GW2 for the past since Episode 5) its common for the devs themselves to announce they're leaving which feel weirder.
---
Ok, you have an opportunity to sell me on this.
---
We have a player. All he wants to do is run events and collect items from them. He then wants to get on the TP at the end of the day, and dump off every item he doesn't need for himself, and receive the best possible price for them. He also wants to be able to buy items off the TP that other players have found, but that he was unable or unwilling to find directly. He does not want to do ANY research or have any knowledge of economics, he just wants to open the TP and sell the items at the price that comes up, and buy items at the prices offered, and wants those prices to be the most favorable they can be.
---
Explain to me how this player is better off for having TP barons running around? How is it easier and cheaper for him to find the items he wants? How does he get the most possible return on the items he sells? Do you believe that this player is better off from having TP barons working the market, or do you believe that he would receive lower prices for his goods and end up paying higher prices for what he purchases than if the TP barons weren't in the picture?
---
they arent trying to make you buy/sell items on the tp, the games tries to make you.
---
They just try to predict which items those are and at what point in time.
---
If you have one here Agraf.5148 will be so happy
---
Where are you prevented from selling it at the same price the baron would?
---
Why wouldn't the end customer buy it at the same price the baron would?
---
I don't get your logic, you're missing something. Maybe patience. Aka the time worth of money.
---
The dev who made the rev is no longer with the company. Interns they have left don't even know how to read the code probably.
---
I can confirm, as the owner of that channel, that whatever you see on it is stuff I do daily and there are no twists.
---
Sure, but because TP barons are engaging in the market with no other purpose than to turn a profit, they might overcut my price, preventing the buy order from completing, forcing me to put in another one at a higher price, or at least taking longer. In that situation, the person filling that order might make a bit more off his side of that transaction, but over the long run he would end up losing out, because at every step the flipping process is extracting value from the system.
---
Can you spare 2 more? It's for me and my husband I have the same username on discord as I have here. :)
---
Exactly.
---
If there's any left I'd love one please :)
---
Engi is still a monster at open world stuff, just fyi.
---
That statement bares no relation to anything that I said.
---
Same here mate :)
---
Unpopular opinion time: w1,2,3 and 4 are much better than the others. Not sure about the future of gw2 raids
---
I want my tramezzinii
---
Why would something only be a reward if tied to a specific task? do you consider achievement chests not rewards just because there are multiple ways how to go about them? What about precursors? If you're lucky to have a precursor drop, that doesnt feel like a reward because it didnt drop for a specific world boss? What about dungeon armor? I have to repeat specific content for that, yet what I am getting is a currency and I have to buy the actual armor does that remove its reward status? Of course not, all it does is give me a little more option. If there is a path I dont like I can skip it. I can skip the dungeon entirley if I choose too but its going to cost me, I have to finish 8 other dungeon paths to make a little more progress if I choose to skip the dungeon who's armor I want. Gold simply gets that system and moves it to a global scale nothing else.

With all due respect but repeating the same dungeon over and over again for 100 times to get the drop I am after is way more of a "job" to me then spending a couple of weeks playing whatever I feel like and then buying what I am after. 
---
Rewards dont change the nature of content. A dungeon will not become any more or less interesting just because it has a specific drop. If one hates said dungeon they'll still hate it while repeating it 100x for that reward likewise If I like said dungeon I will not like it any less just because it has no specific reward tied to it. Like I said Advantage here if I enjoy Dungeon B more then A by not tieing rewards to specific dungeons leaves me free to focus on Dungeon B more if dungeoneering is what I feel like doing.
---
Wasnt she part of the layoffs?
---
May I have code or 2 please ? I has 2 friends that play with meh 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
---
If you’ve still got some I would love to snag a few! I’ve got a few friends That may not see this thread so if I could get 5 total that would be awesome! If you only got one too bad for them :D
---
Thanks in advance!
---
She left an mmo publisher to work on something that isn’t an mmo, was it because she was tired on working on MMO features? I dunno, maybe you can ask her. So far it fits in with what I’ve been talking about. 
---
&gt;completely pushed away in favor of simplier and dumber things (farmable openworld, strike missions)
---
You realize those are cornerstones of MMO engagement right? The concept of a perpetual endgame is something fairly new. Back in the day, the WHOLE GAME was farmable, open world type content with a few instances here and there, and when you hit the level cap, you didn’t suddenly have a bunch more shit to do. You had hit the END of the game. It was also really difficult to do that back in the day. MMOs used to be **incredibly** grindy.
---
If you went back in time and played MMOs from the 90’s-early 2000’s you’d be floored by how slow progression was. MMOs were designed to take time. You were supposed to set long term goals to work on over months and years of gameplay. That was what the **whole game** was. Hitting the level cap and finishing the story wasn’t some kind of halfway point to continue the rest of the game, there was no rest of the game. When they implemented updates, it wasn’t an extension of the game, they were adding things to the already existing game that weren’t there before.
---
Maybe it only makes sense that we’re moving away from that model, because clearly it’s just not for everybody. You don’t want a better GW2, you want a lobby based dungeon crawler/raid game where there are constant raid updates because there’s no whole MMO to work on and tweak and update. You guys are always griping about how boring and “casual” open world content is. To me it always sounds like you don’t want to play an MMO at all.
---
You should do the very first of HoT and it unlocks the masteries immediately. There's some very mild spoilage, but tbh it's very much the beginning of a new story, and it won't ruin the original story.
---
Not being able to get what they want instantly, oh the horror! /s
---
Anet listening to those type of players has ruined the game.
---
&gt; and you compared it to real people dying trying to prove an obscure point,
---
I'm comparing the two things in *some* ways, not in *every* way. There is a difference. I never claimed "TP manipulation is just as bad as driving through a crowd" or anything of the sort. It's a bit desperate that you seem to be implying I was.
---
Thanks means a lot 🙂
---
I wholeheartedly wish here the best of luck. What she has done to this game is amazing and I'm sure she will keep up the good work.
---
Any left senpai?
---
&gt; how would a TP baron make money?
---
most of the time, he turns a profit by selling convenience to other players, who dont want to spend game time on waiting for their own buy order to fill or their own listing to sell.
---
Code please if it works in Europe 👍🤣
---
&gt; IDK if a skill is going to require you to stop moving it has to be a pretty damn big pay off, but having a skill give a huge pay off also tends to piss other (usually the stupid ones) players off when they get trounced.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; This would mean the amount of direct damage that could be added to it is very limited before people start bitching.
---
&gt; Hence why I say take the kneel off but make it glow more to warn people.
---
If you're going to buff the damage anyway, how would getting rid of the kneel help? Pretty sure people will complain even more if it has all that damage *without* a drawback.
---
Hoping they're alright.
---
i think its a bit desperate by you to suggest driving a car through a human crowd has anything to do with a discussion about a virtual economy.
---
Representation matters.
---
Spin what? It was inevitable that there would be a high attrition rate after heavy layoffs and significant restructuring. Contrary to what you might think, ArenaNet employees aren't robots and will be affected negatively by such major shifts.
---
but why
---
Honestly at points like these I start to think I'm the only person not familiar with the developers working at the company. I have never seen a gaming community that stalks all the devs on linkedin and other places. Been playing this game since 2012, clocked 13k hours in GW2 and I can't name 3 devs working at Anet.
---
the trivia seems like rage bait given that it's inaccurate
---
I'd recommend continuing with the story. The content gets harder in the expansions so it's a nice step up before getting into raiding. It also allows you to unlock your specializations and masteries which you might need for raiding or other high level content. 
---
One tip though, once you get into HoT you'll want to start utilizing the LFG system more to join the map wide meta events. You can find event timers on the wiki. It'll also get you in touch with more people who can help you out. Joining some guilds will help too.
---
I would love to have one as well if you still have any, thanks.
---
I'd love one! Thanks!
---
Same. It's maddening. Are you on Vodafone perchance? Just wanna make sure it's the game, not the internet provider
---
Destiny is an mmo but aight
---
Any more codes m8?
---
Hey, dude. Do you still have two codes left for me and a friend who live in the EU? Much appreciated! And thank you for your sacrifice! xD
---
Also left the day they killed my fav dragon to join in Forsaken saga. Still log into GW2 every week to keep game up to date and meet with old friends. 
---
Its odd to feel sad and ecstatic on the same bit of news at the same time.
---
Reminder set!
---
There are a lot of people who bash shadowkeep. It's quieted down recently, but the most reasonable objection is that it didn't bring anywhere near enough new guns into the game, providing far less than forsaken (and not even a new IB set, whaat?!). There are also some people who are discontent with the story, although I can't say I'm one of them. I think it's mostly people who expected forsaken 2 though, and ended up with rise of iron 2 with less guns.
---

Thank you for doing this for everyone!

If you still have two codes you can spare me and my friend would love to have it.
---
You can buy exotics from the trading Post. At least with berserker stats .
---
You can not buy all stat combinations, but berserker or assasin are the most common stats you want for your power build
---
&gt;level 2
---
there's a difference between sexuality and sex drive XD
---
What about tegwyn and the other chick?
---
Looks to be the Exotic armor for Karma from the Orr temple vendors. Forgot the name.
---
No, you get spirit shards when you are at max level and not training mastery. You continue to get exp behind the scenes and continue to get spirit shards when capped so not only is nothing wasted but the bonus isn't all that important (spirit shards aren't worth much and you'll get a lot of them later). I would suggest not focusing on map completion and instead continuing your story though as the annoying pop-up won't go away til you unlock the mastery system (by starting HoT or PoF) and if you plan to play through season 2 there is a lot of content to get through. [More details on story order and living story here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Story). 
---
If you do plan on unlocking the mastery system you can just start the first PoF mission and unlock a mount (raptor), I suggest changing language and turning off sound or having someone else run you through it so you don't have to get story spoilers though (I'll run you through if you want).
---
In all fairness, as far as we know she hadn't been working on raids for a loooong time.
---
Isnt it LB/sw+ torch in meta builds, or did that change recently?
---
Hi [atrolynnrae](https://www.reddit.com/user/atrolynnrae/) :)
---
If I'm lucky and if you have some codes left, I would like to have one too \^\^ Have a nice day
---
If you have any left I'd love one (or two if possible so my partner can get one too)
---
A few cosmetic raid rewards went into the gemstore too. Xera's mask, river of souls glider, bandit sniper outfit (which was originally part of the raid-themed river of souls glider+outfit bundle), etc. The characters and themes of those items would mean literally nothing to anyone who didn't play the raid, as the stories were self-contained. Kind of get the feeling that they were originally intended to be raid rewards, but the higher-ups had other ideas.
---
You’re getting downvotes but you’re right, I wouldn’t imagine Anet is a desirable company to work for nowadays...
---
Can't you do that anyway? For example: I play DH and can swap to FB build before engaging to pop some buffs and change back. From what I saw only elite goes on CD if you use it.
---
Gz bro. Btw what armor is that?
---
Torch is berserker elite only. I believe this person was talking about core warrior
---
I like how indefensible such a key casualty in GW2's endgame content is that instead of the narrative being "people change jobs all the time", it's moved on to "this subreddit is creepy LinkedIn stalkers".
---
&gt; Doesn't the background start to blur and turn light brown?
---
Only if you have post-processing turned on.  No post-processing, no grainy sepia filters.
---
Are raids and fractals dead content at this point? We don't know if anyone is working on them, is there even fractal/raid team anymore?
---
&gt;She left an mmo publisher to work on something that isn’t an mmo, was it because she was tired on working on MMO features? 
---
What do you think she is going to work for there?  Same kind of coordinated group pve things. It is just that there her servecies are required and here they aren't really anymore.
---
&gt;Maybe it only makes sense that we’re moving away from that model
---
We have moved away from that model by around 2006. What are you even talking about. It doesn't mean there should ONLY be instanced content (as if openworld of gw2 isn't instanced), but all kinds of gameplay should be balanced. Gw2 doesn't drop coordinated group content in favour of going back to oldschool blablala (especially since "olsdchool" mmo were much more hardcore and social compared to what we have here) or for any other good reason, aside from development cost cuts.
---
New player here. What’s the best way to get your first exotic wep and armournset?
---
Do you still have any left? Pleasee
---
What stage is this that we've moved on from "people change jobs all the time" to "stop stalking LinkedIn guys"? The game is hemorrhaging senior talent and we're already at people having so few ways to defend it that we've jumped to trying to ignore it altogether.
---
Wing 5 was the best raid ever made for gw2.
---
hihihi
---
Dude never tried it, doubts it all, won't test it, claims not to trust.
---
This is the pinnacle of hypocrisy :)
---
As an aussie who's never even heard of Quiznos before this "promotion" I'd love one if you can! &lt;3
---
Then stop complaining.
---
If you absolutely need a ranged weapon (which you dont) then go with rifle. Its a better power weapon than longbow, but its still far from good.
---
The best option would be axe/axe and on weapon swap depending what you need greatsword, mace/mace (or shield if you need a block or lower cd on cc) or rifle. Gs would be a slight dps increase if you play it properly, maces for cc and rifle for range. 
---
But if you want to progress into higher tier fractals (t3-4) you absolutely want to play meta builds to be helpful for your team. Meta build would be axe/axe and mace/mace with banners, you can find thr build on snowcrows for raids and discretized for optimised frac builds. Dont use metabattle for builds, they are usually outdated and or bad in general.
---
Congrats now go for the tendril armor!
---
Glad you enjoying the pvp!
---
I personally enjoy it but these days I only play AT/mAT (if at all).
---
Love my wings, gliders, tendrils, and all the mostforged obsidian skins! (Not really into the new pvp weapon set but whatever)
---
My goal these days is the WvW tendril armor set/legendary backpack so even after you get “ascension” there are plenty of pvp items AND a whole ton of WvW stuff to get too. 
---
(My fav pvp item is the ascended amulet called “Vial of Salt” where in the description it says.. “it took a lot of tears to make all this salt” hahahahaha so very pvp indeed)
---
Yeah, sorry. Not gonna run the game for weeks to test your spreadsheets. I'm reading reddit for social experience these days only. Game has not enough content or relevance to invest in economical research for me :)
---
Well, if there are still some available, id really like one too. And if all codes are gone then good job for sharing with others :-). Thats why GW has the best community in a game.
---
Why exactly does it matter what people do after they leave the company..?
---
You could take some raid builds from snow crows and maybe adjust one or two skills for your own workd stuff. 
---
Most raid builds are good for fractal.
---
But there is a fractal website.
---
i would realy apreciate a code :)
---
&gt; I mostly use PoF elite specializations as well, just because they ~~cater better~~ are almost universally ~~to flavours I like.~~ over tuned.
---
Off, dear gods, off. I absolutely hate the look of the overbright post-processing in this game, as well as the bright outlines it puts around stuff you're hovering over. I turn it off and use GW2Hook instead so I can customize the look of the game to my tastes.
---
Then why do you insist on not trusting me? Am I automatically guilty for sharing my findings?
---
It doesn't, the post intends to highlight that someone is leaving who contributed a lot to the game and wishes her the best.
---
Also no.
---
The Free Hand of the Market.
---
Getting colder, then.
---
If you manage to get more, I'd love to get one. Thanks!
---
OK boomer.
---
Oh I don't blame the devs either, especially when you hear how badly anet pays its devs.
---
&gt; especially with the hype surrounding CP2077.
---
That game is going to fail just because nothing can live up to that level of hype. Feels like it's going to be a repeat of Fallout 76.
---
Its peak was arguably before HOT.
---
I imagine he's a switch depending on who he's with. Sure, he likes to come off as a sadist and top, but I could also see him as a really whiny needy pillow princess.
---
In recent interviews, Anet said more raids and fractals are planned. On phone atm,  but the sources are in reference links here: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Upcoming_changes_and_features
---
No word from Fenchurch today...
---
Really?
---
This is how you get the Royal Flame Weapon Set that came out with Halloween 3 weeks ago:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Royal_Flame_Weapon_Coffer
---
This is how you get one of the four new skins from the new zone Grothmar Valley. You can get one for an achievement and also one from a WvW reward track and one from a PvP reward track:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grothmar_Legionnaire_Weapons_Cache
---
The blossoming mistshard armor and the mistshard armor, two full armor sets came out with dragon fall. So far 3 updates in a row have had new skins, either weapon or armor. Halloween and Dragonfall and full new sets.
---
If we go back to the update before that, we have Thunderhead Peaks, which has two full weapon sets as well, that you had to do collections to get. I know this because I did those collections.
---
So you're saying those weapon sets and those armor sets don't count at all. 
---
There were other indivdual weapons we could craft on Halloween too as part of a collection.
---
In the Festivals collection, I did the two Mad Armory collections which gave me a new shield, Carapace of Chaos and a new greatsword called Last Rites.
---
It's like people don't even play this game.
---
Eyes up, Guardian!
---
Unfortunately most of my friends stopped playing altogether, so at this point i just check in for new episodes, to see how the story progresses. The prologue was great, and the plot is moving in an interesting direction, but those are just not the qualities i'm looking for in an MMO, so i just accepted that it's no longer a game made for players like me. I need progression, i need a healthy raiding scene, a healthy dungeon community etc.
---
Oh not at all! I've seen insane levels of dev stalking with other games as well. Planetside2 comes to mind right away. People over there had pictures from company retreats where they matched up Devs based on appearance and behaviour. A video would drop where an excited Dev explained some coming feature and people instantly spotted that the guy wasn't himself, that he looked like he spoke under duress and used unusual phrasing (for him) etc. Another example is when someone noticed that the phrasing on tooltips from a certain Dev seemed off.. they started comparing notes and came to the conclusion that he was depressed.. a bad sign for your favourite game.  
---
The worst part is that a lot of the stuff that these guys predicted based on all this has come through by now. Devs got moved to another project (H1Z1), other jumped ship, suspiciously real looking Glassdoor reviews, company sold and bought by Russian company etc etc.
---
It doesnt matter in GW : once you block some1 - it block it anet tag which block every1 single character on that account.
---
Would love to get a Code ♥️ With love from Europe :3
---
thank's for the great work!
---
someone new will come and that's good. sometimes a game needs fresh faces and ideas.
---
I'm still having fun. What are the signs?
---
&gt; Maybe it only makes sense that we’re moving away from that model, because clearly it’s just not for everybody. You don’t want a better GW2, you want a lobby based dungeon crawler/raid game where there are constant raid updates because there’s no whole MMO to work on and tweak and update. You guys are always griping about how boring and “casual” open world content is. To me it always sounds like you don’t want to play an MMO at all.
---
This is the same crowd that did dungeon speed clears. When they "killed" dungeons, they moved on to Fractals. When Raids came out, they moved on to that. 
---
They don't want to play an MMO. They want to play the fastest loot per second, and then show how "l33t" they are with blinding infusions in LA.
---
Crafting is extremely cheap this days. The only chef is lil bit more expensive and its still fairly cheap. Elite specs is also easy if you wvw enough; you getting it maxed with 1 click.
---
Level 20 should have been the LDoA title. Now it really seems off..
---
I don't believe Tegwen and Carys were ever confirmed to be together, though it's certainly something that's easy to read into their relationship.
---
Anet bleeding experienced devs doesn't matter at all, according to this subreddit. In fact, it's fucking amazing cause that means more newer and younger devs that will bring a fresh approach to the game that will make gw2 great again.
---
\&gt; tomes + scrolls from birthday gifts (takes you to 30/40/50 with 1 click)
---
\&gt; elite spec tokens from wvw
---
\&gt; while its reasonable argument about map compl - youll want to do it another time sooner or later for more gifts of explo or just free blkeys.
---
While you're right for the most part, I disagree with some of your points. We can't keep using the layoffs as an excuse for everything bad that's been happening with the game in the past and now almost a year later. It absolutely had an impact, but it's not the reason for a lot of the core issues. 
---
WoW Classic wasn't a success because of anything current Blizzard had done. It's a 15 year old game so most of their current employees had nothing to do with it during the time. Sure, they had to assign some devs to integrate it into the new client/servers, but that's a very low amount of resources and zero creative power needed to accomplish the task.
---
As far as earnings go, A-Net is doing alright considering there's no new expansion coming soon, however the money MMOs are generating now compared to their cost is not that great anymore and that's why the genre is pretty much left to 5 major titles as you mentioned. ANet (as most game companies) tried to make a move on to the mobile market and GW2 suffered a bit because of it. The risk/reward ratio was just too good to pass on. $70m a year is nothing compared to what the more successful mobile games are bringing in and many of them are so simple, they can be created and maintained by a few people coding in their basement. It's sad, but that's why the market is shifting in that direction. Everyone wants to be cheap and earn more.
---
On my first few toons I did level crafting during my normal leveling, and it was a positive experience, even if not for profit, but for the fact that I was wearing full sets that I gathered and made myself.
---
Nice, hopefully a sign of Destiny2 getting some more dynamic end game content in future.
---
I found a solution for your problem. Go play the game and enjoy its ingame community.
---
Hey, ty for doing this. If u have some codes left I  wud appreciate having one, ty again and see ya in-game.
---
i will ;)
---
If you want mobility, you want a staff daredevil! The 2 skill launches you towards an enemy, the 3 skill flings you away from them, and the 5 skill is a ground-targeted circle AOE that flings you through the air to the target location. Thief has enough movement utility that all of your utilities can be filled with stuff that grants movement speed, control enemy movement, or teleport you. Skills you might enjoy are Shadowstep, Shadow Portal, Haste, Roll for Initiative, and Scorpion Wire. You can even pick Withdraw for your heal skill, which will roll you away from an enemy.
---
Daredevils also get an extra dodge for 3 dodges total. The most-used Daredevil grandmaster trait is Bounding Dodger, which deals damage to enemies around you when you dodge, but you might prefer Unhindered Combatant, which removes movement-impairing conditions and grants swiftness on dodge instead.
---
Why not?
---
Good. One less whiner on reddit then.
---
It's because ArenaNet disproportionately favors open world and casual story content.  With Heart of Thorns they carved out a niche for high-end PvE (T4 Fractals, Challenge Motes + Raid Wings) and have been *slowly* abandoning that community.  Meanwhile, competitive sPvP/WvW have basically been on life-support since the introduction of PvP Leagues.  In terms of game support the only thing that the competitive player vs. player community looks forwards to are balance patches.  
---
Basically, if you're a competitive PvE or PvP/WvW player then your in-game community has been slowly bleeding to death.  Obviously, this isn't a popular acknowledgement, but the state of World vs. World with its tiering system and links? The fact that WvW players have been on an extreme back-burner with the "Alliance" system for the past several years? 
---
ArenaNet's idea of community support is basically buying you 2-3 ice cream sundae's then showing up in 2-3 years and asking whether you've finished that desert and are ready for more.  Then by the time they serve it to you, it's melted.
---
It wasn't one of the skills that I suggested buffing numbers wise or CD wise.
---
For it I simply suggested taking the kneel off and making it glow more to warn people.
---
The real improvements would be from reducing the cast time of the auto to 1/2 second and tweaking the numbers slightly &amp; from swapping the CD's of the 3 &amp; 4 around so that you could place the symbol more often.
---
This would net a decent increase in amount of over all dps without making it any more spiky which is what people in PvP complained about.
---
I would love a code
---
(fearing im too late xP)
---
I like the game, and it's direction but I don't think it's good or healthy to trivialize complaints or call people complaining cry babies. Just as I'm entitled to my opinion, and you're entitled to yours, they're entitled to theirs. 
---
To quote Voltaire, "I may not agree with the words you say, but I'll defend with my life your right to say them."
---
People are entitled to their say.

Funky personality can not compete with months/years chasing an egg across countless maps, finally getting it safe and see it hatch only to watch Aurene die before her prime. I'm Sorry :D

---
And considering all you need to do is to press "craft all" every 10 min, and do whatever the fuck you want during that time (watch a movie, do housework, play something else) and repeat again after 10 min, it makes is a quite a hefty deal for 100g/h NOT playing the game/ being afk/watching movie/playing something else.
---
Would be cool getting one since well .. EU bois don't have Quiznos anywhere :D 
---
Anyway thanks for doing this its pretty cool.
---
By crafting.
---
2k gems for one skin that you want and 4 that you don't want.
---
Raid training discord [\(links on snowcrow's site](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/)) is by far the best way to go.
---
If you have any left would appreciate if you sent one over my way
---
Someone needs a hug.
---
He is talking about this https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale_Ascension_Mounts_Pack .
---
Bobby is probably next
---
I am not saying there is no intangibles at all. These recognition have been there, and been constantly updated, by giving new titles and a truck lord of new armor skins and weapon skins. But they are outdated as recognition. Great as reward though. The recognitions has not been adjusted for the times..
---
Since PoF launched, the most relevant, most visible and most prestigious currency in the game is Mounts. Not armor skins, not titles, no nothing else. Anyone walking around displaying skins does not attract the "wow" factor from a passerby. Very few cares for titles. This is why we don't see people congragating in LA all putting up "freebooter" or "Everlasting Ally of Ahdashim" (which incidentally has 3700 people across whole of gw2. Why don't we see all of them get together in DR and announce?). Because it is not the right form of recognition that the community yearns for. It doesn't matter what the Anet thinks is a recognition, it has to meet the expectations of the community, which is fancy skins.
---
There in comes Mount Skins. Nothing shouts as vibrant and looming larger than life as a Mount. Take skyscale specifically. That 2k mount is a work of art. I am not saying Anet shouldn't charge for it or anything if/when its via Gem store. They should, as a F2P game. But there has to be similar incentivized recognition for players by playing equivalent amount of game time or whatever is deemed fit.
---
The legendary armor doesn't have. No one does. The closest thing is the symbol it appears when entering combat mode from the chest piece. Speaking about light armor in particular, the only thing there is are those crystals that glow.
---
&gt; not luck or Gaeting Crystals. 
---
? 
---
You can buy the bench straight up from the tp.
---
Yes, how do you think it gets there?
---
The bench is either dropped by Dhuum or purchased for raid currency. It can then be sold onwards.
---
I’ll take one if you still have any
---
If you still have a Code available and didn't yet get insane from the huge amount of responses, I would love to get one! - greetings from Germany
---
Well, looking forward to the court case then, because i'm interested in the outcome. I highly doubt that anet has to pay any compensation though.
---
This is nice to know information, but not "need to know" information or "content."  I can relate to people feeling a little content-starved, but the next content patch is on 11/19; it's only about a week away.  Hopefully, we'll be able to let this rest soon and ArenaNet will jump in with some more meaningful teasers for the new map/content.  That said, I think they've been doing a slightly better job with teasers lately, so that's something to look forward to I suppose.
---
oh awesome... good to know it wasn't so dumb \^\^ thank you

The difference between buying a skin from a general vendor/gem store and getting it from a collection/boss loot/fractal is to me that buying kind of spoils the RPG element of the game.
---
The game world is more immersive to me when I get a, for example, mount skin as loot from a mounted boss or as an egg from a matriach than go somewhere to buy it upfront from a NPC or worse go through the gem store UI and get it delivered straight to your mail.
---
What gives is that I'm, personally, a little weary of "there are no in game mount skins" being suddenly warped into "there are no in game rewards (or recognition)".
---
Many posters, including yourself, are doing it in this thread and are using wider spanning, and inaccurate arguments, regarding recognition or acquiring items to try and justify the need for mount skins as a reward.
---
You do it in your very first post in this thread where you suppose there is no recognition for activities such as Silverwastes when there absolutely is.
---
That's probably because the argument of wanting a very specific type of recognition, mount skins, is a much weaker stance to try and discuss from.
---
I think you mean by switching that you chose a weapon from a chest. You can not undo that.
---
But you can just equip another weapon. Just buy it in the trading Post
---
sounds like a name of the porn star.
---
Ok this is perfect for such newbie :) thank you. and thank for the advise. I'm going back and doing mission and map uncovering as a normal user again
---
Wow, that's actually nice! She was absolutely wasted talent on this autoclicker, Destiny's raid designs are top notch. I'm sure she'll find that way more fulfilling. Looking forward to her work there!
---
&gt; the best after the core game
---
oof
---
This is good. Wait, let me get more popcorn... Alright, keep going.
---
Considering the amount of hate they received over innocuous statements regarding SC's benchmarks pushing certain agendas and professions I'm not surprised. It was really vicious, quite unfair and, ironically, it later emerged that the benchmarks were actually being inflated through grinding, use of writs, and were not actually comparable for each profession.
---
I think what he means is that the level 80 boost gives you a choice of a free weapon and he used it on a staff instead of a greatsword. I only think this because I've never used a level 80 boost and don't actually have a know how they work.
---
He has a point tho. In this sub every post about fashion is hit with comments to go to another sub. Many questions are downvoted to hell as long as they are not complaints about Anet because "these belong in the megathread". Art? Let a few posts of these pop up in quick succession and someone will complain about it.
---
I think the reason for the infrequent posts is probably the discribed above. There are only so many things that you can complain about without repeating everything over and over. There are a few actual discusions about loreetc, but as far as I can see, these are quite rare atm.
---
Take the lol sub: They ARE complaining left and right. Nevertheless the whole sub is filled with posts about flashy outplays, lore, upcoming changes, Esports, art and the inevitable discussion whether some champs are balanced or not and what people would change.
---
&gt;company that had a better reputation/track record than Bungie.
---
Are you kidding? Bungie does weekly blog posts with more content and information than Anet's BIG REVEAL of the icebrood saga.
---
Make sure to experiment with all the weapons you got from the boost and to try out all utilities. Experimenting with them is usually what one does when leveling up and unlocking them bit by bit, so you missed out on that. 
---
Also, when you're gonna make your second character (GW2 is very user-friendly when it comes to having lots of characters), consider leveling up regularly without using the boosts, especially if you're going to play an Elementalist or Engineer (they have LOTS of skills and utilities, so going slowly and learning along the way is better).
---
XD  k
---
You can doubleclick on any weapon that the class can equip and then you use that weapon. A Charakter can swap weapons.
---
Litany of wrath, aegis out the ass, blinds, access to Stand Your Ground. DHs with half a brain can manage their defenses easily.
---
First of all, I'm not the person you were talking to. I didn't state anything in my comment because I haven't commented in this thread before.
---
Second of all, the title of this post is 
---
&gt; "No Mount Skins Earnable In-Game?" 
---
So you should already be going in assuming that what we're talking about is mount rewards. If that weren't enough the comment that you originally replied to actually ends with the scentence 
---
&gt; "What these nebulous people want is mount skins as a reward."
---
To which you replied 
---
&gt; "Didn't realise the portion of the text I quoted mentioned mounts..."
---
So you're totally right, the portion you quoted did not mention mounts, but that was clearly what that particular post (and everyone else in here) was talking about. You're the one who's completely off topic.
---
Not that it’s of any importance, but I left gw2 for d2. No regrets.
---
Tequatl and Triple trouble are all I did for a large chunk of time, and raids are the only thing that kept me interested in the game. Her leaving is another major loss for this game.
---
Jumping scrolls - 500 gems each, EANET.. it's in the game!
---
i misread (missed  the mayor part) but even then it still seems like a hot take you'd find on an armchair activist's twitter page.
---
If you have a bandit death mark in inventory can you spawn a legendary bandit executioner by killing a champ without being on a bounty, or does it need to be a bounty (via encoded orders)?
---
I greatly appreciate what you are doing! Great stuff!
---
My wife would love to get a code for her and I'd like one as well.
---
Have a good week everyone here. O/
---
Big thanks again! :)
---
yay, codes
---
as an eu citizen I would love to have one
---
Would love a code if there is one left. If not then just happy to see something like this happens here. Cheers!
---
It is strange that they are stackable, but I would still assume the content of each box is decided upon receiving it (so your board settings of that time).
---
&gt; the baron isnt taking up a spot from a regular guy, he offers more per buy order and sells for less. That regular buy he just put out of business was just someone who wanted to pay less for an item. I dont know why you cant understand that a higher offer by a tp baron isnt directly benefitting the seller.
---
So if he's paying more than anyone else would ever pay, and selling for less than anyone else would ever pay, then how is he not losing massive amounts of money in the process? 
---
If the profits margin he makes come from neither the person he bought from, nor the person he's selling to, then where is it coming from?
---
Btw, I think you might be misunderstanding the argument I'm making here. It is not that "TP barons should just restrain themselves and not participate in the marketplace," that is unrealistic and might indeed have a worse overall result. Rather, my point is that the marketplace itself should be designed in such a way that TP barons *cannot* have a meaningful impact, and that whatever dubious "service" their interactions provide would be provided automatically, with the benefits redounding to the average players. 
---
Like if you're positing scenarios in which buy orders would not be filled and sale listings not picked up without some kindly TP baron to come along and save them, I'm saying that players should be given more guidance so that the buy orders and sale listings they place are more in line with what a TP baron would do. They prices they get should be what the TP baron would get, if those prices are actually available to be got. 
---
The problem with the current system is that it offers advantages to players who have more knowledge and experience at working markets, over players who don't. Again, there would be nothing wrong with this if the game was *built* around economic trading and that's what *everyone* was hear to do, **or** if the economic gameplay was completely siloed from the other content in a way that had no significant overlap with an adventurer's gameplay, but it is incompatible with a system that *all* players are reasonably required to interact with in order to play the adventure game at all efficiently. 
---
&gt;I was talking about items that actually exist, not items that havent been farmed yet.
---
Perhaps you were, but that was irrelevant to the point I was making, which was that adventurers *generate* economic units through their action, and *burn* economic units through their action, while TP barons merely shift them around in a shell game. They neither create nor destroy, and are therefore superfluous. 
---
&gt;How are items staying in the economy a bad thing?
---
Because they are not serving a function. An item sitting in an inventory or on the market is not serving a function. If a TP baron has a dozen Legendary Weapons in his bank waiting to be flipped or just as a wealth token, then those represent a dozen players who are *not* swinging legendary weapons around, enjoying their game experience more for having them. If you have a stack of 250 mithril, that is 250 mithril that is not being turned into swords and armor and other items that people will put to a purpose. 
---
Every item in the game should enter the economy, and then either be used by the player who received it as needed, or placed onto the TP. Once on the TP, it should be purchased by someone who intends to use it, either equipping it, burning it for a single use, or otherwise converting it into something they value. There is no benefit to the item entering and leaving the TP multiple times, if someone does not intend to use an item themselves, then there should be no reason for them to remove it from the TP in the first place.
---
&gt;But a higher price always benefits the seller, there is no way around it. 
---
Perhaps so, but in which case, Player A might be disadvantaged because he bought an item from Player B today and had to pay more for it, but also, he would be advantaged tomorrow when Player B bought an item from him at a higher price. The fact remains that it's a closed system, if player A and Player B are trading items back and forth, then at the end of the process, on average, both would end up having more money than if Player C was also involved and he was skimming profits off the top of what they were doing without contributing anything of his own to the pot. 
---
**It is impossible for player C to add value to the system.** 
---
&gt;But if the flipper is there and he benefits also, its 66% of all parties benefitting, which is a higher benefit rate than 50% without the flipper.
---
Lol, [that's some ninja math there.](https://xkcd.com/2217/) 
---
&gt;If player A and B farm the same item they dont need, they would have to sell it to a vendor, if player C doesnt put in a buy order, effectively destroying the item.
---
Almost true, in an exactly three party system, but then if we were doing that, then why would player C buy the item, knowing that neither A nor B would want it, and therefore he'd be wasting his money? Player C would only buy the item knowing that there were other players out there who *would* buy it from *him,* and if such a customer exists, that customer would exist for A and B to sell to as well. That last bit is wrong though, because it wouldn't be that A and B would have no option but to destroy the item, they can just put it on the TP, and leave it there until someone comes along to claim it. 
---
&gt;Sure it applies to the whole system, to all transactions, every day because everybody agreed by their own choice to any deal on the tp. 
---
And if you shuffle a deck of 52 cards often enough, it becomes a deck of 60 cards. Somehow. Apparently. 
---
&gt;But they choose not to because they value instant gratification more than a bit more profit.
---
Or because TP barons rely on other players having less complete knowledge of the systems and how best to employ it. "They should have known better" is no justification.
---
&gt;I never claimed the profits for the flipper came out of thin air, I said he is paid for offering instant gratification and convenience.
---
And yet every item he has to provide *already* existed on the marketplace, and could have instantly gratified someone else whether he existed or not. Again, he is *not* providing convenience, any more than it would be "convenient" for someone to run into a grocery, buy up their available stock of soda, and set up a table outside offering people the "convenience" of being able to buy soda from him at 150% the retail price. 
---
&gt;Flippers offer a service to other players, thats it. They can take advantage of that service or not. Its their choice, which you for an unknown reason want to take away.
---
I've been quite clear on my reasons.
---
So did Byron Miller, he was a Design Team lead since 2013.
---
That or being salvageable, usually giving junk that refunds the salvage cost, but with a chance to give scribing materials that have material storage slots, like:
---
* Leathers
---
* Papers
---
* Book covers
---
* Wood pulps
---
* Pigments
---
* Flax fiber
---
That would give some use to all those recipes under 1 silver in the trading post.
---
This would work too
---
For a Power Warrior (i.e. your Berserker equipment) the best DPS weapons are axes.
---
Greatsword is also a very decent damage option but falls off the longer the fights last and is less good with the Berserker elite specialization, which is the preferred specialization for group content. It gives a lot of mobility which made them popular for easier group content, where you want to get through a dungeon as quickly as possible. It's also quite nice if you don't own the expansions, just to get around quickly!
---
Maces are geared towards CC for either breaking the Defiance bar of stronger enemies or in PVP, with decent burst damage. A mace is very useful in the second weapon slot when leveling around the open world.
---
Shields are very strongly geared for PVP and only have minor use in PVE.
---
Besides that, you have the Hammer which is a pure CC option that has very limited use in PVE and Sword/Longbow, which are geared (more) towards Condition damage.
---
Warrior lacks really great ranged options, especially when playing alone. For the occasional encounter having a Rifle or Longbow in your inventory is nice, but don't worry about crafting an ascended one.
---
In General: The difference between Exotic and Ascended is not much (little more than 5%). The biggest difference is mostly between the base damage of weapons (which are the most important pieces to have ascended) and the stats from jewelry. They are mostly important because the feature infusion slots for fractals.
---
For dungeons you want to build similarly to this: https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/warrior/banner/
---
Don't worry about the runes in the maces (although they are probably cheap), the maces are just for breaking the defiance bar. You can use the same build with a Greatsword, just take Hightened focus instead of Axe Mastery.
---
For runes you can use Rune of the Eagle as well (they are even cheaper than Thief) or Rune of the Ogre, which is real nice when playing solo. If you want to save gold you can also use "Major" Sigils, instead of "Superior" ones.
---
_________
---
The Metabattle builds are a bit iffy, imo. Yes, most Meta builds are in there, but there are also some fairly weird / unoptimized / old builds in there and without guidance you might end up buying crafting unnecessary stuff.
---
It's better to understand where you can find certain tools in your traits/skills and then make a build that fits your playstyle!
---
So like I said: Axe / Greatsword is where your damage is. Axe Mastery in Discipline, makes your Axes better. Forceful Greatsword not only makes your axes better, but also gives Might on Crit so it's valuable, even without Greatsword! Might and Fury are the most important boons when playing solo, so you want to be able to buff them yourself, so consider "For Great Justice". You also want to be high on Crit chance, so Signet of Fury is always a nice skill when playing solo.
---
You will also want something to remove conditions, so look into Brawlers Recovery (Discipline Tree) as well as Mending/Healing Signet/Shake it off.
---
You need something to break stuns on you. Stomp/Balanced Stance/Shake it off
---
Lastly you'll want CC. It let's you break Elite/Champions and it helps keep faster enemies in check. Stomp/Bull Rush/Bolas are all nice.
---
Generally the Tactics tree is mostly for group play and Defense is mostly for PVP. That leaves you with three trees. Best thing is to go through every tree and pick the trait that seems most useful to you and then maybe revising it after trying it out for a couple of hours. Keep in mind that utility skills belong to certain categories, so having two of them and then supporting them with a trait might be useful (just don't go overboard, it's usually not worth it to go 5 Signet/Physical/shout skills.)
---
Condition and Heal/Support builds were only really opened up with the expansions, with the new specializations and new stat combinations on items. Also the content in core GW2 is best done with 5 damage dealer.
---
So the best classes to play for Heal / Condition depends on whether you own the expansions.
---
Edit: So I thought about it and I don't think you can build a nice Condi / Heal char without the expansions without severly gimping yourself, unfortunenately.
---
&gt; I mean, he automatically loses some amount of money on each purchase and sale he makes, so is he just out a net 15% on every flip?   
---
This would be true if buy orders did not exist. They do though and there are and always will be items where demand is higher than supply and this is projected by the difference in order/buy now price.
---
The only impact this has for the casual who wants to buy the item is that he has more competition when trying to make a buyorder. The price is still set by the sell-listing which in turn is determined by what people who want to use the item are willing to pay for it. 
---
&gt; We have a player. All he wants to do is run events and collect items from them. He then wants to get on the TP at the end of the day, and dump off every item he doesn't need for himself, and receive the best possible price for them. He also wants to be able to buy items off the TP that other players have found, but that he was unable or unwilling to find directly. He does not want to do ANY research or have any knowledge of economics, he just wants to open the TP and sell the items at the price that comes up, and buy items at the prices offered, and wants those prices to be the most favorable they can be.
---
Explain to me how this player is better off for having TP barons running around? How is it easier and cheaper for him to find the items he wants? How does he get the most possible return on the items he sells?  
---
Why should that player get the best possible results from the system? Why would the system cater to a player who does not care to learn anything about the game? Who has no idea what he could craft from the items he farms or where he should farm if he wants to craft something specific for himself? Or rather - what about the player who does that? Who scours countless wiki pages to see how he can make items that other people are willing to buy? If pricing was favorable for the player who just sells everything he doesn't immediately identify as useful to him and buys everything he wants to have outright then there is no profit to be made for the crafter, no reward for his knowledge.

When you use the Level 80 Boost, you get all the weapons for your class (for Necro that is Staff, Scepter, Axe, Dagger, Focus, Warhorn.) You have all those in your Inventory.
---
The Necromancer can only use a Greatsword when you activate the Elite Specilization "Reaper", that's why the package didn't give you a GS.
---
HOWEVER when you unlock the Specialization, you get an exotic GS for free! You need to  accrue Hero points by activating them on the map, in order to unlock the specialization. When you do you should get a notification in your top left corner.
---
I guess I'll try this out :3
---
This community is very weird tho. Everyone know that creepy buddy who imposes on everyone so hard. And acts too friendly. Right? Some kind of weirdo. This is exactly gw2 community... They seem to be friendly, but its in some way unhealthy and scary. I've got friend who's well-known youtuber. He started playing gw2 in the past and he quit very quickly. Because of this community. He has never met such cringe people as in gw2.

Is there any guild organising Verdant Brink on eu servers ? If so when are they doing the meta ? I am missing bladed coat boxes for the collection and I really want to move on from Verdant Brink !
---
Just in case, one please!
---
You shoudl make a healer necromancer-scourge for raids, it's super easy to play and if you gear it in exotics/rares you're good to go, sit's super cheap.
---
*"Bad apples, trolls and griefers"* get sanctioned very very quickly with name changes though.
---
I know, because I was, even though I used my own personal family name which had nothing wrong with it, but was interpreted to have *"historical"* connotations of a lesser known figure.
---
Lots of people enjoy pvp and wvw. But sadly those modes, wvw especially, have been ignored. While pvp has had some additions and changes over the years it hasnt been much.
---
“I’ve invested a fair bit of money” , you mean gold ? Just shut up dude, go in court with Anet then because of how scammed you’ve got in their damn game, pathetic.
---
Thanks :)
---
I kinda agree, I would have bought 3 or 4 if the price was lower (600 gems, for example). I think I will try to grab some of those if Anet decides to put them on sale again :D
---
can you reliably combo fields on any group content?, please share your secrets

Crafting in Guild Wars 2 is worthless with two exceptions:
---
**Exception 1:** Character leveling. Each crafting discipline that you get to rank 400 yields 7 character levels. By taking all 8 disciplines to rank 400, you can gain 56 character levels. If you do this by following good guides, this will cost between 200g and 250g. The best guides to follow are at gw2crafts.net. They're automatically updated every 15 minutes based on current trading post prices.
---
Using crafting as a way to level characters is the primary reason for crafting being worthless in general. If I use 1g worth of materials to craft a piece of armor, I'm getting the armor piece *and* I'm getting XP. Because people want that XP, they're willing to sell the results of crafting for less than the cost of the crafting materials. For any craftable item, if that item is available on the trading post and the materials for that item are available on the trading post, the item will always have a lower value than the raw materials.
---
**Exception 2:** Account Bound items. Some items are Account Bound which means they can't be sold on the trading post and there's no way to obtain them other than crafting them. For these items, obviously, crafting is valuable.
---
Company losing half its staff and most of the talent is good for gw2 :) Everything is fine :)
---
rip no fractal release. Boneskimmer at least looks sick.
---
Look like you were a minute late, it has already been posted.
---
I would love a code if you still have one, thank you so much for doing this.
---
I heard about this through someone else; this looks like a fantastic series; and it's only getting started!
---
I would love to take one, when theyre available again
---
If your TP is loading after 20 seconds clear your cache, itll load near instantly. You also have benefitted from it, so your few gold you've lost at most is actually less, if not a net positive.
---
&gt; This would be true if buy orders did not exist. They do though and there are and always will be items where demand is higher than supply and this is projected by the difference in order/buy now price. The only impact this has for the casual who wants to buy the item is that he has more competition when trying to make a buyorder. The price is still set by the sell-listing which in turn is determined by what people who want to use the item are willing to pay for it. 
---
But what if the mechanics of the TP were designed in such a way that players would not have to *know* what the "right" price should be, the system would make that clear to them by using the same basic strategies that flippers use? That way, players wouldn't "get it wrong," the clear price to list something at would be the same price a flipper would be aiming for. 
---
One mechanism I've been thinking about through this thread is that they could perhaps make it so that you can easily lower the price of your sell orders without any cost. The only added cost would be if you removed the item from the TP entirely, and *that* cost would rise over time, making it an inefficient use of time to place an item on there permanently, hoping to pull it back off later, but making it very easy to reposition an item to move faster. I think that this system would result in prices meeting in the middle much faster, without getting unwary players stuck. 
---
&gt;Why should that player get the best possible res
---
Because this is an action/adventure game, that player is participating in that system to the best of his ability, so the system should be designed to best support that playstyle. It's the same reason that the person who wins the PvP tournaments should be the one that is best at PvPing. 
---
&gt;Why would the system cater to a player who does not care to learn anything about the game?
---
Of course this player would know plenty about the game, he just wouldn't know much about *economics,* and nor should he have to to make the most of an action/adventure game's economy. 
---
I mean, take a game like EVE Online,  how fun would that be if they just made it so that the player who was most skilled at piloting a ship, regardless of his economic prowess or wealth, could just single-handedly pirate everything in the game and steal all the wealth from the other players. Would that be a game mechanic decision that would be compatible with the sort of game system they've developed over there? 
---
&gt; Or rather - what about the player who does that? Who scours countless wiki pages to see how he can make items that other people are willing to buy? If pricing was favorable for the player who just sells everything he doesn't immediately identify as useful to him and buys everything he wants to have outright then there is no profit to be made for the crafter, no reward for his knowledge.
---
Yep. 
---
I mean, a crafter should be able to profit from crafting, to some degree. If he buys 1g worth of materials, and spends as long crafting them as it would take an adventurer to earn 50s, and then sells the results on the TP, then he can also earn 50s for his efforts, but he should never be able to make *way* more per unit of active time spent in the game than a player playing the action/adventure game efficiently, and it shouldn't require him to employ special economic knowledge or track prices, the "correct items" to make should be readily apparent to any player, those tools should be built into the TP and crafting UI itself.
---
Sick trailer and 3 strike missions oh boy
---
What exactly are people even crafting
---
Not gonna lie, this trailer got me hard. I dig this new mood.
---
If you still have one i'd like one if possible. Many thanks in advance =)
---
it is a MMO by definition, regardless of what the company's marketing philosophy is.
---
Massive -&gt; yes
---
Multiplayer -&gt; yes
---
Online -&gt; yes
---
Boneskinner is ready AND SO AM I
---
DOOOOOM!   DOOOOOOOOOM!
---
Imagine not being able to mount up because your mounts are scared or whatever.
---
But three strike missions!
---
Wondering why the went with a weekly rotation but the fights look dope!
---
RIP this post.
---
I'd like one for my friend please :) A little surprise
---
Bosses look absolutely brutal.
---
Really digging the dark, despairing horror vibes from this.
---
The legendary weapon looked a bit underwhelming but in general this is pretty hype!
---
Massive -&gt; No, you can only connect with 5 or so odd players at a time. Massive specifically refers to being able to connect with a large number of people at once, in MMOs.
---
Multiplayer-&gt; Yes, that’s why they call it multiplayer.
---
Online-&gt; Yes
---
It’s missing one of the major components, it would just be considered a multiplayer game. You don’t find Destiny on MMO lists for a reason.
---
Rotating means that people won't be able to rush through it and then stop playing again until the next update.
---
I'm probably late but if you still have one code I would love to have one.
---
Keeps people playing the game and not be frustrated after one week because of easy content, now its 3 weeks before people start complaining Kappa
---
/u/AnetHoGM, since the snow season is here for a while, you might want to poke your tech guys to work out those compression artifacts on snow; I'm not sure whether that's on the pre-production capturing phase or on the YouTube compression phase (in which case 2k/4k resolutions will help), but those snow segments look horrendous on modern displays. Which is a real pity since the overall episode trailer quality has gone quite up recently.
---
It's not a legendary weapon.
---
Will the new weapon set have a northern lights theme to it somehow? The name made me think of the aurora borealis, that'd be so cool!
---
I'm pretty hyped for this!
---
10/10 trailer
---
DE I wouldnt really classify as a 'reputable' dev though. Yes, they put out a lot of good content but I still remember them vindictively and purposefully fucking over 'universal vacuum' just because they wanted to get snarky with the community.
---
Rebecca is great though as a PR rep though
---
Now this is ~~podracing~~ content!
---
It's an upgradable weapon set not a legendary weapon
---
rip endgame pve content but at least they are pushing out strike missions i guess?
---
...and then the Boneskinner comes out, and you're put permanently in combat.
---
Wait? TWO masteries? That's hype!
---
They better be a lot more challenging/entertaining than the first one.
---
Maybe we dont get a new fractal for 10 monts now and no new raid for 5 months but at least we have 3 new cool strike missions to kill on first try without any cool rewards :)
---
Because its not a legendary weapon :) its a weapon that you can upgrade through achievments most likely, like the armor in jahai bluffs
---
Raids are far from being the best content to make loot. Some braindead pve farms net you more loot, and they aren't time gated to once per week like raids.
---
They enjoy raids cause they provide them with gameplay that cannot be found anywhere else except for fractal cm's. Raids make the most of gw2's amazing combat system and that it's going to lure players who aren't satisfied with just spamming 1 a the time. The loot in this context is a bonus.
---
&gt; Also, I wonder what that mastery, Essence manipulation, is all about.
---
Since it's Raven, might as well be falling damage, all the recent trait changes considered...
---
That's not a problem when elementalist needs AT LEAST 8 new skills for their weapons, if not more. Main-hand is 12, two-hand is 20.
---
let me start off to tell you that i never ever posted on reddit before, but this little tool actually made me do it.  
---
HUGE thanks, i really appreciate soo much &lt;3  
---
I had over 50 builds and templates across all characters, so this makes me at least get it back a little bit.
---
Thanks for explaining my post to me. I had no idea it was my intention all along to call out the inaccuracies of the numerous posters here claiming there are no in game rewards when what they actually mean is no in game rewards that give mounts.
---
It's almost like that was entirely intentional to point out! 
---
Do feel free to let me know if you'd also like to do my day to day work for me. Thanks again for taking the time to spell things out for me.
---
Wow, that's quality shitpost!
---
3 strike missions plus the first one looks harder
---
Pretty sure it's just YouTube being shit as usual. Can't control the bitrate on YouTube, they don't want your single video clogging up their storage space. The only way you can improve it is by increasing the resolution (1440p, 4K) and/or the framerate (60fps trailers please, it's almost 2020, it's about time).
---
Hello there dear friend, if you still have any code left, i would love to have 1 thanks :)
---
Makes sense to me. Raids aren't a thing in GW2, or for Anet specifically. Also bosses on here can't be overly complicated, so sounds like she did not have much to do or room for much growth.
---
Thanks for your generosity OP. Even if I don't get a code, many of these other fine people will. Best of luck to all!
---
"Those 3 bosses could be enjoyed by 90% of our playerbase, but no, let's make them interesting only to 10%."
---
You're more than welcome. I'm not going to do your day to day work, but I have taken the liberty of looking up some basic reading comprehension courses that might help you avoid similar problems in the future.  
---
[https://www.udemy.com/topic/reading-comprehension/](https://www.udemy.com/topic/reading-comprehension/)
---
Localised entirely within your home instance?
---
That sounds pretty snazzy but also more like something they can make super glowy and stick in the gemstore and make more money off
---
Yea it seems like there will be two different masteries with this episode.
---
5mins of daily content rotating weekly oh boy.
---
I see that cheeky reference.
---
I've got 16000 hours. Just need to find that thing that you enjoy. For me it's mostly raids and fractals, while story/achievements/open world with something on my second screen.
---
Not a shitpost, he's right and it's really sad that there's literally nothing being delievered for people who actually want to play the game for longer than 5 hours after every update.
---
This is a great trailer. It set the tone, it gave a tease and wonder what the hell happened there, it showcased released content to play or acquire. 
---
And also, since a long time ago I wanted GW2 to have a darker tone, and at times it was just too silly and childish for my taste, but with this, I am actually really looking forward to the next chapter. We need it more serious and dangerous at times so that those fun times can be even more meaningful. I mean, we are fighting dragons, the most powerful beings out there, we should be scared so we can feel heroic and like we really are a part of an epic adventure.
---
what do you mean, the strike mission rewards were better than half the raid rewards?? if the 3 new strike missions match the first then strike missions are potentially very rewarding
---
I'm always in the boat that if you point it out as an abnormal thing then hey, it will always be abnormal. We're just people, why does it even need to be a big thing. Should just be natural by now.
---
I don't know, maybe that's just me. I prefer a world where sexuality is as big of a deal as choosing your favorite color.
---
Also I still say that your father from one of the Charr story lines is gay, he stole a powerful idol to give to the humans in hopes of saving his friend. I will fight to the death to defend my gay Charr dad!
---
TheQuickFox.3826 if you still have any offerings.
---
I'm in Europe, and never heared of Quiznos.
---
I'm hoping that a lot of this map has the chill / cold mechanic from the latter part of the Prologue story that made the terrain difficult to traverse and meant that mounts were disabled.
---
I really loved the Bitter Cold area of Bitterfrost Frontier though so would love to see that expanded upon.
---
5 mins of gw2 a week is more i can handle anyways Kappa
---
Yeah but the smaller part are the ones who actually know how to play the game
---
Hey, if you still got some i would take some :) 
---
My small guild got 5 members. Would be realy nice. Thx greetings from Germany.
---
I dunno... I thought the chair and the shoulders were pretty cool.
---
That reference to "protect us" again. Same as the previous trailer. What are the devs hinting, bigger than Elder Dragons, that Jormag keeps offering protection from?
---
Even if they ramp up the difficulty of the first strike, it's still boring and there are no real mechanics you have to do. It's not engaging and takes less than 5 minutes a day.
---
new map, new events, more story, ... this was always a part of GW2 endgame content - since the release of the game!
---
sure a new fractal would be awesome! but acting like there is no new endgame content coming is bs.
---
https://reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dvad5r/the_icebrood_saga_episode_1_whisper_in_the_dark/
---
RIP
---
Glad to see that Strike Missions are being expanded at a more rapid pace than I had anticipated. Was worried it was just going to be new versions of the current one for the first two episodes.
---
Now just throw in some challenging CMs that need reasonable compositions and up the difficulty on some of those in the rotation and it will be a nice distraction from raids.
---
Plz make a hard mode, anet.
---
&gt; The only way you can improve it is by increasing the resolution (1440p, 4K)
---
I mean,
---
&gt; (in which case 2k/4k resolutions will help)
---
But I'm really not sure whether that's on YouTube. The other parts of the video look crisp enough, even those with occasional snowflakes, but there are several shots that look... pre-rendered, poorly compressed, and then put into the trailer for secondary compression by YouTube.
---
It's just another thing to do. You could say this of daily achievements (5min), fractals(30min), etc. It's all just meant to add to the available total.
---
We have 3-weekly 5min bosses to do, aren't you happy?
---
Ok Really is anyone else super excited that jormag is not in the trailer at all
---
Noone care about raids in gw2. People wants strike missions.
---
Bitterfrost Frontier grunts humbly.
---
Oh God yes please. Make him a colossal threat. Not invulnerable, that's important. Have players struggle at first and quickly lose hope. It hits like a truck, doesn't seem fazed by whatever amount of damage you pour on him. Maybe nice screen effects that get your adrenaline pumping if he gets near you or something. Pulsing borders, your heartbeat getting louder and louder and faster, lights dimming, mists thickening. Jormag's whispers, offering you escape and safety.
---
Hnnngggg.
---
This isn't even time gating. It's just a simple rotation much like games where they rotate maps for competitive modes.
---
Nothing is stoping me from killing the boss. I just don't get to kill a particular boss until later. I still get rewarded for my time.
---
For me, time gating is when you have to wait for something and get nothing out of the wait.
---
Looks fucking amazing!! Gonna play the shit out of this episode
---
Do they really have to spell it out as "challenging end game content" for you?
---
me pls!
---
No. I don't know why people keep excepting it. It's like they LOVE to be disappointed.
---
what does upgrade-able weapon set mean?
---
Bro gave me chills
---
Worth a shot
---
Call it the Barbariantalist.
---
[woodenpotatoes, analysis!](https://imgur.com/TuvQ0xU)
---
Ty for the chance, definitely would take one if you get some more.
---
LOL your comment got me good
---
Those got a fuckton of collections and whatnot. Nothing is being delivered for people who want to play organized, instanced PvE content.
---
Boneskinner needs and achievement that requires it to be beaten in 3 minutes or less. The achievement would be called "Play Time!"
---
I kinda wish the elite specializations would focus on one aspect. One, it would be much easier to balance, especially if they add more of them. Two, it would help keep the core specializations relevant. Three, it would make raid and pvp assignments easier.
---
The hyperbole is strong with this one. Apparently only people who like difficult instanced content want to play the game for 5 hours every update. You're literally wrong here, because there is a portion of this playerbase that plays for achievements and I'm 100% certain you're not getting every achievement in 5 hours. There are also people who play for skins, and they're not getting every skin in five hours. There are people who play alts and do story on multiple characters.
---
I have a guild full of people who barely have time to do the stuff they want to do in game. What you're saying is simply not true.
---
destiny is pseudo mmo similar to stuff like phantasy star online/vindictus. you dont actually explore anywhere, just matchmaking into lobby instances
---
It was certainly a welcome addition, especially with its vertical scale, but just too small of an area, bright, and not dense enough to deliver that oppressive, wild feel.
---
Eh? You can do the fractal CMs daily. For normal fractal it works because they need to limit the rewards.
---
Why would you want a hard raid rotation? To have even less content?
---
&gt; Thief might get boomerang-style mainhand axe or blackjack-style mainhand mace.
---
i'd love both, but i'll still secretely hope for GS.. thief, daredevil, rifle guy.. everything but a proper samurai\ninja spec so far...
---
I wouldn't call a 4 min auto attack boss enjoyable.
---
They switched to no hardcore endgame PvE content.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Rp-uo6HmI
---
GW2 players often forget concepts such as "friends" and "guildmates" do exist.
---
I would like a code, please ;3
---
They better not kill off general soulkeeper. She was headed to that fortress in the prologue.
---
Press F to use raven statue, press F to release raven power?
---
What weapon is that?
---
Yeah, fall damage reduction doesn't really feel right in the Talent System as it is today.
---
Probably similar to the dragonsblood weapons.  Do an achievement for the exotic, then build up to the ascended.
---
super hype about the trailer.  
---
And, I believe rotating bosses on the Strike Mission is brilliant.
---
Me plis!!! Thank you so much!!!
---
Weekly rotating even, as if there wasn't little enough weekly content already.
---
It  will also depend on if there is a CM of not.
---
Put it down to 2% at max maybe even lower.
---
insanely low chance for a skin and even rarer chance for a chair... are you fucking high how is that better than raid rewards. do you even know what all raid rewards there are?
---
The difference being Blizzard devs and Blizzard themselves usually just announce it.
---
What are strikes missions?
---
Id like to get a Code! Thank you stranger &lt;3
---
living story is not end game content when i can literally just auto attack every enemy to death solo
---
Sometimes their is some data mining. Like when people saw team members from the D3 team move to an “anonymous game teams” etc. 
---
This is announced sometimes later but we hear about it in advance.
---
anet: not a priority
---
Aww, thanks! You shouldn't have!
---
You've done a great job too of complaining about me being off topic and then only contributing through attacking others on a personal level. Good work.
---
Maybe next time you'll even think about trying to contribute to the discussion, maybe argue back with a stance that supports inaccurate statements continuously being made about the rewards available in game? Or maybe you want to concoct some sort of stance that what we have as rewards now just isn't enough and how a mount skin would really shake things up?
---
Would be good to actually have your thoughts on this but I don't see that happening given how much you've taken this off topic and instead made it about a poster you don't really like, all while accusing them of being off topic (despite the conversation being about in game rewards)!
---
Anyway. Give yourself a pat on the back. You deserve it. Have a lovely day!
---
so you have tested the 3 new ones already? they said strike missions would get more mechanics and more difficult with every release.
---
so wait and see.
---
They don't want to risk us all getting that engaged.
---
Jormag is the female voice talking in the background.
---
At 0:59 it looks like Koda's Fire has gotten out of hand. Almost has the same vibe as the Flame Legion when they went full-flame-on.
---
Looking good ArenaNet!  Could've used a Fractal or Legendary... but otherwise good.
---
Maybe Primordus? Or maybe he's offering protection from the Pact Commander and Aurene. A lot of people perceive the alliance of PC and Aurene as a threat, as we've seen during the prologue episode.
---
love the dark tone of this, love the skinner (can we get it's skull for a helm please?) just wish we werent doing more masteries that are going to be one off specific things we never use again.
---
I could use two or three if still available.
---
They're literally a bridge to raids. Even raid bosses get done in less than 30m after a week of release.
---
It's like the ones who are still invested in the game want new endgame content to keep them engaged.
---
As a queer person myself, I gotta disagree with you. Queer characters should be allowed to just exist. No need to justify why they're there or give them much backstory. Having a few spread throughout the game without any justification makes them (and the world) feel more real to me, and makes it more normalised.
---
Weekly rotating so fuck you if you can't play some weeks I guess.
---
Kill 300 mobs in the new map for 1AP is not endgame content.
---
Yeah they definitely nailed the tone for the saga.
---
Doesn't matter, the Lion's Arch Aerodrome is already [up in arms](https://i.imgur.com/dhzBQcC.png) about it.
---
Despite these people very likely being the same people that would say Strikes are too easy and therefore not for them.
---
The mind boggles.
---
It seems fractals now are officially dead, let alone cms...
---
That was a really nice trailer, can't wait!
---
I think they should do away with Mantras having to be prepared. It's super annoying. Lengthen the cooldown 5s when using the last charge if need be.
---
But having to recast the mantra just because I zone. Or because I dipped into the water for a moment (where I may different skills) is not fun.
---
&gt; Raids made this game much worse after all. It made us toxic.
---
Did you not play dungeons at release?
---
Yeah I love pure RNG drops from unengaging content that have thematically very little to do with the content itself. Luckily ANet is smart enough to keep throwing away their actual good reward structures for RNG to pad out shit content time and time again.
---
I completely agree with you nagennif. I used to do regular raiding every week until my groups all fell apart. Personally (unpopular opinion I know), I like the direction of strike missions where it's 10 man content that you don't have to have a particular comp and it's open to more people. I still love raiding and need to go back and finish my legendary armor, but there's so much I want to do in game and there's not enough time for all of it.
---
&gt;Raids made this game much worse after all. It made us toxic.
---
Entitled casuals made this game toxic.
---
I didn't expect anything, but I am actually surprised, that it looks dark and mature. I really like it !
---
Come on now. You are going to have to try harder than that. "Hardcore" endgame PvE has never really been a focus of Guild Wars 2 and despite this, the raid releases have been consistent since Stronghold of the Faithful to Bastion of the Penitent.
---
That cadence was implemented over three years ago.
---
Now, it is not great. But presuming there has been a recent or sudden switch is silly and incorrect. We're continuing with a standard release rate. If it wasn't an issue three years ago (which is when people like myself were raising it on the official forums/ twitter), why is it now?
---
*Press F to use raven statue, press Special Action Button to release raven power. 
---
Fixed that for you
---
Both groups are guilty.
---
Not I the current iteration no. Too short, too easy, they won’t keep people interested long. 
---
I’m hoping the new ones will take the level up a notch, but there isn’t any possible comparaison with raids from the first one
---
I agree that it could be PC + Aurene but the tone used gives me a "I can protect you better than them", as in you dont want to be with THEM (PC+Aurene) once IT happens. 
---
I dont think its Primordus... Maybe bubbles? But I want to say something away from ED's
---
That's good for Bungie and Destiny 2.
---
&gt;Am I wrong?
---
Yes
---
Well, considering that I've seen entire guilds disbanding and abandoning the game due to lack of raiding content, especially after that jokingly easy first strike mission, I must say **no, they aren't**.
---
Also stop with that toxic accusations. Me and my friends were just playing weekly and got continuously new people into a deeper layer of content. PUGs are always having constraints in every direction ( heck, you can even be kicked from Lab farms for stupid reasons ).
---
This is casual mmorpg, that's right, but the issue is that lack of endgame content will inevitably make the game lose population over time, until the gemstore sales are not enough ( and in case you're wondering, even those pesky raiders used to invest a lot into the gemstore ).
---
*grabs popcorn
---
Strike Missions are a great success in my eyes.
---
I did the strike mission every single day, and even on ungodly hours like 2am , the group fills in less then 2 minutes.
---
Love it!
---
There was a single "recent" release that wasn't bundled with a living world episode. I don't think that's sufficient to think that they have properly switched away from it, especially regarding fractals.
---
You extrapolating your own opinion to everyone does not mean raids are not beloved.
---
Thank you for lowering the bar so god damn low that you actually complain about meta events being too hard for HoT legendaries, and some idiot actually upvoted you for it.
---
Wow. Just wow. 
---
The bar is already low for GW2, but you have set the bar *low*!
---
The last time I played Guild Wars was probably 2 years ago.  I leveled a dual pistol rogue and loved every minute of it.  When I level capped, it immediately became un-viable and unfun.
---
I am just curious if anything has changed and if I could possibly level cap a character and do PVE progression as a dual pistol player now?
---
Oh look, ANet delivered on a promise with Strikes. And everyone was so pessimistic...
---
LUL If you think raids made GW2 toxic you live in a tiny bubble.  If you want to see real toxicity try 1 burning the Octovine in AB and watch all the virtriol pour in from the so called "friendliest community ever."  GW2 casuals are only friendly if you conform to how they think or want "their" game to be played.  If you go outside of that, this community is more toxic and hate filled than any other I've been a part of.
---
Also, GW2 was not meant to be a casual friendly MMO at launch.  It had all the makings of a hardcore PvP game and they even tried pushing E-sports with it.  Casuals co-opted the game into "their" game.
---
I hope that I can join Boneskinner's side.
---
It's okay. We have [new complaints now](https://i.imgur.com/dhzBQcC.png).
---
Man I wish I could be hyped for this trailer, but I really just am out of hope for this game.
---
Hey man,   
---
 A roadmap is a high-level overview of a product or project’s vision and direction over time. The roadmap shows the overall strategy and work required to get there. 
---
Most games have a roadmap because it's a great tool for communicating the game plan to both the players and internally to the team and owners.   
---
I actually wrote a more in-depth article on [what is a roadmap](https://airfocus.io/blog/what-is-a-roadmap/). Check it out.
---
It's just Jormag trying to seduce you.
---
Irrelevant. The code used to select items from loot tables is the same in every part of the game. The loot tables are different, but the underlying code is the same and that code doesn't have "only drop this once" functionality.
---
I like the in game one, it looks like a bud
---
Well we know that in the Icebrood Saga trailer from PAX Jormag was talking to Bangar. I can't remember the quote. I've always had this theory that when the Dragons are killed the Gods will return maybe it turns out this was their plan all along.
---
Free stuff? Count me in!
---
I think we should have the option for both. I get that some players would like to see more hard endgame content and there is nothing wrong with that. However I think providing a more accessible option for the majority of players is a good idea. I don't agree with everyone wanting a Hard Mode for strike missions though. Strike Missions are suppose to be easier and since you can go in with a random group of people there is no way to make sure you can get the right composition to do a hard mode. Obviously they could just have Hard Mode only available for Pr-constructed squad mode. However there are still taking more resources away from actual raids when they do this.
---
Honestly I think they should use the Stike Mission bosses in new raids. That way they already have the assets and that can essentially be the hard mode. It would make sense in my mind. Train new players with strike missions then when they are ready they can take on these bosses in raids but with harder hitting attacks and more difficult mechanics.
---
I think both strike missions and raids are good in the long run.
---
The most toxic someone ever got towards me was AC cuz I forgot to equip frost bow on ele (was newish to the class and said so), and I now have ~500 essences, ~1500 LI and all raid titles  (all CMs from pugs)
---
Of course we will have more strike missions in a year than Raids. Strikes are just story bosses with upscaled health you can just afk on. The quality difference between icebrood construct and qadim are night and day.
---
south failed burn..... P A N I C
---
New instanced PvE, released with the prologue. They are easier than Raids but intended for 10 man groups, unlike Fractals. ANet also said they will be building upon them and, as the episodes roll out, the exiting ones will become larger.
---
It's not necessarily time gating no, it's even worse. Sounds like bosses will be unavailable for entire weeks, while a timegate can always be progressed.
---
Now that you mentioned, I have to agree, the tone really points towards that. Maybe has something to do with the Elder Dragons' progenitor? When Kralkatorrik died he said "*mother*". I think there's a threat out there bigger than the Elder Dragons and Jormag is probably trying to "protect" everyone in a very twisted way, just like Balthazar did when he turned the desert upside down just to kill Kralkatorrik.
---
You're going to get abused like there is no tomorrow, but raids never fit into GW2's design philosophy, *especially* not with that shitty 2006 system Anet dragged from the grave. And since they won't turn their raids into something more fitting, I guess Strike Missions are the logical step.
---
Ok zoomer
---
The raiding base isnt toxic, the casuals who want to go in with 3200 toughness doing less than 1k dps in a dps slot calls it toxic. Look at it this way, do you like wiping at a boss for 2 hours straight with no rewards or would you like to get in and out like strike missions? One pull, one kill, rewards and off you go. Most raid training ask you to know your rotation (spend 10-15 min on it) and have a proper setup, that's it. Theres entire guilds dedicated to training raiders in a no-toxic zone, theres hundreds who raid and train while they raid, my guild included. It's not toxic, its we dont want to spend 5 hours on Cairn wiping over and over because you cant buy 30g of zerk gear or spend 15 minutes learning your basic rotation.
---
I have always theorised that the first strike mission was an introduction to the concept. We know from data mined posts that shaman has done that there is a challenge mote and achievements for the first strike mission and that it would evolve. I think Anet did a smart thing if I'm right make the first strike mission easy to lure in the ultra casuals (like me) then increase the difficulty going forward.
---
Fuck Anet.
---
Idk, they did just write a metal song about her, seems like killing her would make the song even edgier
---
Jormag is clearly offering protection from PvP and WvW game modes since they are a total joke currently. We must accept his chilling embrace and come to the dark side (PvE).
---
And just more Fractals and Raids that they promised to expand upon. We're nearing a year with no new Fractals with the last one being the shit show it was, 5 months since the last raid, and Strikes are absolutely not a good replacement for either.
---
Still hoping for more than 1 level masteries and sad that no legendary
---
regarding those whispers, is it Jormag talking in the head of Norns like mordremoth did with the Silvaris ? Even if Norns aren't Jormag's minions ?
---
*not engaging to you. The rotation however is an interesting design choice, yes. My guess is on Anet trying to prevent a CoF1 scenario. But we'll see. It's also going to be interesting to see the difference in difficulty compared to the one right now.
---
feelsbadman
---
I will be great if you could send me code!
---
If only the Strike Missions were actually, you know... rewarding... They're just... not.
---
Raids are literally the only reason why GW2 wasn't 100% dead and gone when HoT released.
---
Weekly rotation is pretty fucking shit for people with limited time to play. If one is just extra rewarding every week, superb. If only one is available every week it's just a big fuck you to people who want more replayable instanced content to play each week.
---
This sub is so weird with its downvotes. They're just asking for some help and suggestions are getting blown up too. 
---
I use [this build](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vJAQNAneRjMdQZH2FCOeAnIGICK9Lm+tAPhXYFsAIC6ZA-jRSGABlrPYIlfD8AAqX9HpUCCy+DGcIAA4EAkwRAgUAVp1C-e). Axe/Shield and GS. I have pretty good results with it.
---
what makes you think strike missions won't be toxic? have you ever failed a map meta? do you remember when HoT first came out and people were failing the tarir defense? or even farther back when tequatl would actually fail? players have always been toxic. raids has done nothing to change that.
---
Depends on the user's point of view. "Extending content playtime" for people with a lot of daily/weekly playtime, or "decreasing content pressure" for people with less time.
---
With how much stuff you, technically and practically, already *can* do daily/weekly in GW2 for various rewards, especially after the recent buffs to the 2nd expansion metas, you either end up abandoning old content or burn out trying to do all of them. Yes, hardcore players are already typing angry replies at this, but ANet has their metrics and those tell them what their actual playerbase does in what amounts and how they should spread content to make their experience better.
---
why would u ever make a group at 2 am for strike mission when you can literally solo it
---
It'll never stop being hilarious how people *defining* their gamemode through exclusivity call people who want to be included as toxic and entitled.
---
is that jormag? or the bone dude
---
Yes, once there's so little Raid and Fractal content with the pace being super irregular and proceedingly slower, people will try out different content like strikes. If those are also implemented in a shitty way, they'll complain about it. Surprise, people complain about things they dislike. If ANet keeps offering more of that, more complaints will come.
---
Sorry to be a bummer, but Kormir said she was the last god to leave and that she was about to leave when you meet her in PoF.
---
The human gods are all gone.
---
Closest things left are Aurene with Balthazar's powers and Dhuum still chained at the Domain of the Lost. 
---
And finally, humans, and their gods had a lot of spotlight already. It's charr and norn time.
---
Fear me this night, as you'll most likely go astray frost-daddy.
---
Glint: "What did the forgotten tell the gods that they didnt tell me?"
---
k
---
'10-man' instanced encounters that can be solo'd with about 3 nonthreatening mechanics. At least that's what the first one is.
---
why are you still playing then after 7 years?
---
We already have it confirmed that Jormag is non-binary and has a female voice: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxuxc1/jormag_is_nonbinary_and_is_voiced_by_a_female/
---
To get the full reward?
---
not that j can speak for everyone, but i've only missed a single day with the current strike mission, and guess how many relevant drops i got. if they stay with pure RNG BS the "very rewarding" part is going to be *very* subjective.
---
Curious, what's the good structure? I see all of them get flack around here.
---
Chance drop - "RNG sucks"
---
Collection system - "Mindless grind"
---
Garunteed drop - "Too easy to obtain"
---
I'd love to see a source on these numbers people keep pulling out of their arse.
---
Finally some voice of reason.
---
Was pleased to see that they told us what features/skins are coming.
---
They really need to get over themselves and add CMs to Strike Missions.
---
Raids were never defined through exclusivity, but by challenge and teamwork. Just the strawman Reddit seems to make up. Of course, to an open world player that might seem as excluding them if they're unwilling to actually practice content before completing it.
---
Nah. Bobby's comfy as fuck.
---
"surrender to my will!"
---
Dagger/shield
---
Its not coming.  Unless we get a surprise fractal with this release people can pretty much assume fractals and raids have all but been declared abandoned.  They will never admit that.
---
I loved fractals and raids as much as the next guy but they have some serious issues that probably are not going to get fixed.  There just isn't enough new players moving into these modes.
---
Fractals has the issue to where participation outside of t4 fractals is really low.  Players are litterally hard gated from participating with long time fractal runners with a huge gold sink.  Even if they did manage to start and complete lower levels, this does not guarantee the gear needed to progress.
---
Raids.  While these are a bit easier to get into gear wise.  It is a pretty hard jump from completing the story/strike mission to the difficulty of the mode and understanding of a build.  As of right now, strike missions are supposed to help with that, but they are a joke.  On top of that players are tasked with finding 9 other competent people and still may spend hours with no success.
---
Rewards are an issue in both these modes.  Fractal rewards have not seen am update in years.  In addition to no CMs added. People have stopped running them.  After the alure of legendary gear wore off raids saw a hard drop in interest.  Fractals should have a new carrot with every fractal.  Raids need something more compelling than skins and AP that are exlusive to raids to make the learning curve worth climbing.
---
On top of getting very little new content.  I'm afraid the popularity of these modes are going to continue to decline.
---
I'm sure they will be so dope that you can literally ignore all the mechanics and just face tank, spamming buttons randomly, and still succeed.
---
All correct.
---
as much as I shit on the game, this looks pretty cool
---
It'll be too cold for them.
---
Can I see it?
---
It's not home yet...
---
So you guys are ok with a [weekly rotation](https://i.imgur.com/AEqygoo.png) for bosses ? Isn't that way worse than any timegate ?
---
First off thank you Abaddon the trailer is released a week before. Secondly 2 new strike missions and an updated strike boss good. Two new masteries when we only knew about one. The Bjora Marches doesn't bring back many oh nostalgia moments for me but nice all the same. An upgrade able weapon sets. Now to the downers no new legendary weapon generation I think this is a bad move people need something like a legendary to go for, no new fractal again it should have been in this release maybe they have decided to add one after they release the episode like with the raid and episode 6 of season 4. Remember they did say that an update can be anything maybe fractals will be one the smaller updates we need clarification on that. Things I hope to see new skill challenges. Even if there aren't any new elite specs for a while yet put those blue hero challenges to good use that were datamined by shaman months ago. All in all a good trailer I think there has to be an open door reddit AMA after the release please Anet just do it this one time its unlikely but someone can try. The dark theme is working for them I love it and Jormag being able to communicate with us reminds me of Mordremoth communicating with Sylvari. So I'm looking forward to the episode.
---
Look. I know you guys wants raids so much. I was the same. However you have to accept this fact. No matter if you like it or not. Guild Wars 2 is not raiding mmorpg and it won't be. No matter how much you want this game to be raiding mmo. Pve in gw2 is made for casuals since release (2012).
---
Strikes are so insanely faceroll and hard to fail that the failing scenario is difficult to imagine lmao.
---
"Why do I hear boss music?"
---
&gt;We're here to have fun. Not tryhard.
---
Speak for yourself, I'm here to have fun AND challenge myself in raids. They're not mutually exclusive. It's just too bad that Anet and I seem to have different priorities in the game now.
---
The entitlement is people wanting a gamemode to not exist just because they're unwilling to put in the effort to participate in it themselves.

Not even core specializations do that.
---
All of them have 1 main focus, with 2-3 side focuses.  It could be summarized like this:
---
* 1 form of damage
---
* Another form of damage
---
* Self-defense
---
* Ally support
---
* Profession mechanic.
---
And then you have many variations how how that goes.  
---
Sometimes there's a bit of defense on a damage line, sometimes a bit of damage in a defense line.  
---
Sometimes the "precision &amp; procs" line goes with a damage line that focuses in condition damage, sometimes it goes with the other damage line, or  the profession mechanic lines.
---
Oh! I somehow thought it was some type of dual 'claw' weapon haha. 
---
It looks really cool here, you did great on it!
---
Can't have players actually replaying content, they want them out in the open world mindlessly grinding achievements instead because that might technically be more playtime for about a day.
---
Great trailer and I look forward to jumping back in. I wish we had some word on the last few legendary accessories though.
---
Yep. Imagine taking a year to develop ~10 mins of 5man, instanced content or nearly a year to develop &lt;1 hour of "challenging" 10man, instanced content.
---
It might not live up to the crazy expectations but it won't fail. Actually, CDPR might actually deliver on those expectations, you never know. If it were any other dev I'd agree with you 100% but I'm willing to give CDPR the benefit of doubt here. Doesn't mean I won't wait for reviews but still, I'm optimistic.
---
The thing is, I consider raids very easy and I think that with GW2's combat system they could make so much more difficult encounters. If the new strike missions are half as hard as Vale Guardian, that's still waaaay too easy. 
---
The hope is that Anet does all of this just to get people used to 10 man encounters so players can start learning their abilities but in the current format I don't think that will happen. Players will learn what their classes do only when they're literally forced to apply boons / overcome a dps check and at this moment nothing in the game provides that in a casual-friendly manner.
---
From a design perspective, you can use rewards tied to content as meaningful ways to push that content as being done by the players. This is why some players continue to do certain events in GW2 or other MMOs long after their release, so long as they have some value (skins, better stats, etc).
---
The goal then, is to make content fun enough to warrant running that content multiple times in your attempts to acquire the reward of your choice; whether it's get X hundred tokens, Y % drop rate, complete a difficult task/achievement, etc.
---
If every piece of reward is boiled down to 'how much is this in Gold', then there is a tremendous amount of emphasis in both design and player perspective in terms of how much Gold/Hour does a piece of content give.
---
Not all players will want to run the most efficient route, but a lot will. And designing for 'I want to do what I feel like' is an impossible task, because of how nebulous and subjective it is. As a result, it's a lot harder to organize the design of content.
---
This release might have one or multiple CMs and/or hard achievements. Let’s not jump the gun...
---
That's a very pessimistic way of describing a common and inoffensive player retention technique.
---
I'm officially hyped.
---
Wing 8 is coming on March 17th which is 280 days after wing 7. Strikes are the future for EAnet.

---
i would take one if there is still one left, thank you
---
Tokens with chance of an RNG drop, like they do with fractals and raids.
---
You can work towards the reward or get lucky whilst doing it. Of course, the content that gets the reward needs to actually be engaging before rewards even matter.
---
Stay away from Tacobell.
---
Eh they'll never be happy is the actual answer. Always something to bitch about
---
Why do you think it's brilliant instead of letting you access all of them at once?

I think he/she talks to anyone he/she thinks might be corruptable and are somehow close...in fact also quaggans, kodans and other animals have been corruped. The norns maybe hear it better because they're linked to the spiritual world.
---
And that's not really representative is it? Unless you ignore the giant problems with an outside source like that which people can even only speculate on.
---
Epstein will not kill himself.
---
Yeah, 10% seems high. Not that many people raid
---
Now that's how you make a trailer. 3 Strike bosses. Neat!
---
Slightly disappointed that the ArenaNet logo at the start is still the Path of Fire purplish logo with the Path of Fire sand effect. I'm assuming this means that we won't be getting a new frosty launcher or login screen.
---
Other than that, the trailer looks pretty cool!
---
Good to know. Thanks for the comment!
---
i haven't been playing all 7 years
---
In theory they should become harder now...and keep growing in the next release/s. Let's see how it rolls out xD
---
The moon is made of cheese. Ahh those forgotten fucking snakes.
---
I'd love the official source on this! Especially on the 90% that apparently plays strikes too.
---
Anyone else wish there was a way to acquire the Mystic Chromatic Ooze if you made Jugg before the Legendary Collections? I check with Hobbs from time to time only to leave with sadface.
---
Thanks! I don't know the show or book that inspired you but I like the star wars empire officer look, and simple-ish discrete outfits are hard to find.
---
The earth is flat and round at the same time because of Marvel Quantum explanations.

---
I got my endgame content, so I think I'm good. It's crazy. It's almost as if everyone has different goals and tastes!
---
Agreed looks pretty dope.
---
Reminds me of the darker tone we had during Long live the lich trailers.
---
All and all i think its gonna be more edgy and really dope.
---
I assume it's related to the original storytelling of gw2. Angelic being descending to pass judgement or something. Dragons are protecting Tyria from diablo
---
I would like a code please.  Thank you &lt;3.
---
I'll jump in and make one last quick comment before this account gets abandoned forever, or maybe not since it's only one letter removed from my name.
---
Thanks for all the nice comments, it's really heartwarming to know how much the players have enjoyed the content I've worked on.  And there were so many amazing memories watching you try to take down these challenges via Twitch on release day, so thank you for playing and succeeding (but mostly failing).  I moved out of creative development over 2 years ago is why I haven't had a lot to say here in a while.  I suspect that trend will continue, such is the life of management.
---
Go forth and be excellent to each other.
---
What did we give up for this, though?
---
Was it worth it?
---
Ever heard of "toxic casuals"? Yeah, more often than not they are 3x worse than raiders. GW2 wasn't initially designed as a casual game at all. It was leaning towards endgame becoming harder and harder the further it got until it hit HoT. They ANET slowed down until PoF where they said "fck it, lets make the whole story and open world beatable by just pressing 1111111".

If the game mode requires teamwork and cooperation and you are unwilling to cooperate but still expect to be allowed in the group then yes, you are being toxic and entitled. Are there bad eggs in the raid community? Yes, there are bad eggs in every community but that doesn't change the fact that most groups who advertise as training or looking to help newer players will accept anyone as long as they cooperate and play viable raid builds.
---
I think they should just roll the bosses out and only put them on a rotation once the saga's over.
---
So what i don't see in your statement is the evidence that raiding made gw2 toxic. In fact raiding brought ppl together in gw2, like dungeons did before and fractals still do too.
---
Did you ever participate in a Meta event where something is not going according to the plan of a "commander" who is entitled enough to think only he knows, what's right and not?
---
What is the point of playing a MMORPG if you just hotjoin a grp, don't communicate and just press 1, because there is no challenge to it at all. I'd rather look out of my window and watch some birds flying around then, since it is more interesting.
---
Then again GW2 might be considered to be casual. But why is that?
---
Because most of the ppl are not willing to engage with the "harder" content, because there are no meaningful rewards to it. And then as soon as there is something harder, they feel entitled to have that by just logging in.
---
Let's face the truth. After every "hardcore" player left the game ( speaking of all gamemodes ) and we nearly reached that point. This game is finally doomed to die. And why so? Because the ppl who are making posts like this, or ask for faceroll easy content are leaving after 1 week of playing the new story and give a shit about the players who actually want to play the game to it's full potential.
---
This is honestly getting ridiculous now.   
---
Firstly, don't pluarlise things. I've not "attacked others on a personal level" I've only replied to you. At best I've attacked you and only you. I also don't remember remarking on you personally once. So I gather that you're upset but I don't agree that I've attacked you in any way, I just pointed out that your comment was off topic for the thread we're in.  
---
You then responded to that with childish sarcasm. You had to option to respond with further discussion about mount related rewards if you had wanted to engage in discussion, but instead you opted for childism sarcasm in which you didn't so much as mention rewards, it was entirely about me.  
---
I can only be left thinking that you weren't one bit interested one bit in an actual discussion and just wanted to come back to put me down because you can't accept that you were wrong on the internet.  
---
At any rate it isn't going to be worth my time to keep responding, I've made my point and I'm bored of you now.
---
there are assholes on both sides. no point of accusing only one like you or OP did.
---
That's an interesting point of view :). I hope it will be something along those lines.
---
Anybody know wich points those new masteries are going to use? POF or basic TYRIA?
---
I am at around 20 LI and progressively learning raid bosses. I easily join 200+ LI groups, I link the LI I have and just say that I am familiar with the bosses, and that's it. Never was I kicked from a raid group thus far.
---
In theory raids and fractals would also be releasing more frequently, but we've seen how that (didn't) roll out.
---
are you saying auto attacking *is akshually* end game content
---
Isn't that most of the game though? You can buy most stuff on the TP, so you can grind for the chance, and earn a currency (read: Gold) to get it without RNG at a certain point.
---
I guess it's not a static NPC price, but I think the difference is largely perception.
---
I like strikes. But comparing the two is not fair at all. 
---
Strike missions are short instances with no events. Just, so far, a small run and a jumping puzzle leading up to a boss.
---
Difficulty aside, since we're making assumptions based on THE FIRST STRIKE MISSION, raids are far more complex. Both mechanically and in content.
---
SO, yes, they're adding three new bosses, one of them is an upgraded Ice Construct, but what IS really IN a strike mission? Hardly anything other than a singular, fun boss.
---
While I agree these are more accessible, that doesn't mean a game can do without anything remotely even hard. You and I aren't the only players in this game. There are those who enjoy challenge. And you could argue that this isn't the right game for them but that's also hardly fair.
---
GW 2 at the end of the day is still an MMO. And MMOS have to cater to a wide audience or else they get Wildstared.
---
Well as someone that has all the skins and AP raids has to offer.  Raids might as well die.  It is extremely hard for teams to stay engaged with such a lack luster release schedule.
---
Personally the game is now casual for me.  I've completed all the AP beyond Ultimate Dominator and 10k PvP wins.  I only log in for the few evenings worth of stuff the updates offer.
---
I would struggle to find a competent static team to complete any new raids.
---
The idea of strike missions are nice.  I hope the prologue one was just that.  The trash mob of strike missions.  That shit is way to easy to replace raids as compelling end game content.
---
Exactly! So why is it seemingly so baffling to you that others actually do give a fuck about their preferred endgame not being happy when it's completely ignored?
---
really nice of you.. ty!

Been quite pessimistic about the game these past few months, but this trailer looks really good.

---
Just need wins on three classes, that was the hardest for me tbh. Nearly dropped to bronze on my third class. After painstakingly getting all the wins, switched to my main and almost reached Platinum when I completed the legendary wings.  I was so burned out I stopped playing PvP for a loooong time!
---
Gold is a universal currency. Magnetite is specific. Magnetite makes it so you actually have to play the content the rewards originate from for said rewards (bar very few exceptions). At the same time this incentivizes playing said content, and also makes the rewards more prestigious and admirable than just another RNG drop you bought for gold. If gold was a specific currency, it would work this way as well. 
---
If you don't see the difference still, do you feel rewarded when you buy something from the gemstore via gold? Or do you feel more rewarded when you get a specific achievement reward or work towards something for a long time?
---
Its not even so much in rotations. Many mistake raid bosses as DPS sponges which is not true. In most cases all you gotta know are the mechanics of the bosses, and that's it.
---
here's hoping the new ones have actual mechanics.
---
I think if have to accept that they won't put that much effort in asset creation anymore. It's clear that they try to save as much money by reusing older landscape assets compaered to expansions where almost everything is brand new.
---
Despite that I look forward to the update. What they've shown looks fun.
---
&gt;there are assholes on both sides. 
---
Sure. I've met asshole raiders too. But keep in mind the raid community is much smaller, and thus' there's less assholes as well. 
---
In my 4+ years of raiding, I think I've only ever been kicked about 10 times from unpleasant commanders.
---
But the amount of toxic casuals far out number them. And they're much more vocal on places like reddit and the forums too. And the difference is ANET keeps trying to appease them, so they actually have a damaging impact on the game.
---
Amazing that we go 10 months with no sign of Fractals even continuing being worked on, save for a few tweaks/updates. Yeah, the change to Molten Furnace was a good one, but the change to Aquatic Ruins just made it awful for unorganized teams to complete - especially on t4 where the mob pressure is just too much. Kinda similar to how the mob pressure on Siren's Reef is too much for a lot of pugs to handle, even.
---
Just... what are they even doing anymore? I wish I had a clue. There's no real indicator that they're even continuing work on a new raid wing anymore. For all we know, raids could have also been shelved and we'd never even be told. I've never felt so pessimistic about a game's future. And it sucks, seeing as I've been with this franchise for over a decade. :(
---
&gt;while a timegate can always be progressed.
---
Lol because time passes? This weekly rotation is only a timegate **if and only if** there are rewards tied to specific encounters (as opposed to Strike Mission rewards, which could always be obtained). Otherwise, it's simply a variety of content.
---
If you'd rather avoid the TP completely I'll buy all your unidentified gear, any color, at 95% of the sell price. You'll save 10% from tax and not have to worry about the lag.

Fractals were mentioned to be coming every two episodes.  Some people gave a pass because the swap of season 4 to 5 and the first episode was a prologue.  But if there isn't at least a fractal this time around, they should be explicitly stating that because they DID say that they were releasing them every 2 episodes and the last one has been over 10months now.  I don't care if endgame isn't their focus, but one raid and one fractal a year is completely unacceptable.
---
FRACTALS ARE NEW DUNGEONS! literaly..

Uhh, that looks fucking awesome.
---
You're literally shutting yourself in a bubble. There are enough voices of reason in this thread explaining perfect reasonably why they disagree, yet the only one you deem worthy is the single person agreeing with you.
---
This comment has for the first time fully made me realize how echo chambers are such a thing on the internet.
---
hopefully Destiny 2 improves with your talent. I still haven't uninstalled so I might give it a go again.
---
what do you think happens when it gets too difficult for casual players?
---
That's people who play for rewards, and not for fun and engaging contnet. Those people I don't consider players, they're addicts.
---
They might limit mount travel in the new maps, like how it's done in the strike missions.
---
If they keep extending the Strike mission system and eventually add harder versions of the bosses, they will become the necessary bridge between story and raids.
---
But if they abandon it like they did with everything else, and never make a team to refurbish old content and extend the strike system to past story and raids, it will all be for naught.
---
They have finally realized that it's better to make 'dungeon' versions of story maps to make twice the content for less than twice the work, but now they have to go through with it.
---
https://imgur.com/a/TK70JFi
---
It's the same shitty boat as festivals. If certain content is not available for the majority of the time, you're completely locked out of it.
---
It's not about the rewards being available, it's the content itself being unavailable that's the problem.
---
The cinematic seems on point, I expect more animated cutscenes like the prologue... The map looks cool and beautiful... But that's about it?
---
The fact we get two masteries instead of one could be innovative, but I expect these to be map-specific so not usable anywhere else. A new weapon set... Ok cool, but I'm drowned with weapon skins already. As for strike missions, if they're to pull another Khan-ur mask case with cool items having a drop rate of 0.000001%, no thank you. It's irrelevant if the encounter is cool if the rewards are poor.
---
Moreso, I've been fighting bosses, doing fractals and raids as a Weaver for two years now, strike bosses combats won't be refreshing.
---
I just threw up thanks
---
I've given up hope a long time ago, but if you lower your expectations enough you might be only partially disappointed.
---
I'd say Hellblade
---
I'm so sad my Carys Tegwen ship isn't validated.
---
It isn't engaging to anyone.  How tf is strike missions engaging?  Ill admit I don't mind the first one, but it should never have been marketed as a intro to raids and it shouldn't take the place of fractal/raid releases (not saying it is, just that it shouldn't).  There are people in there that are doing 1k dps, downing to everything and providing no group support.  These players get carried by a couple decent dps players or just auto attack until the boss is dead and then think they are ready for raids.  Strikes would've been fine as a single instance boss from story mode, but being an intro to raids is stupid as shit.
---
Seems like Guild wars is getting darker. Loved that trailer

When did you stop playing it? Was it still with Activision-Blizzard? I gave it a try again after it transitioned to Steam and so far I've had so much fun, I can't recommend it enough.
---
P A N I C.
---
There is an HP Lovecraft story called "The Whisperer in the Darkness."  If the draw on the theme of this story it is likely that Raven is already corrupted and trying to trick us.
---
I'm not op, my friend :p
---
It has both good and bad side, good being that maybe more people will try raid so maybe ANet will give a bit more attention to PvE end-game content, bad side being that if new people are going into raids they will be welcommed by the wannabe tryhard community with meta class requests and epeen measuring, and I need to say that I pug from time to time in low LI groups too just to have some time to play the game and also watch a movie in the downtimes, and i need to admit that even in 100LI groups I seen people getting kicked for low DPS on meta classes like DH or Mirage
---
Overally I dont think strike missions being advertised as easier versions of raid because they are too easy(and now am talking about the only one we have as of NOW) maybe the next ones will be harder and harder till they dont reach the Raid skillcap, just like T1 in fractals getting people into T2 and so on then CMs, also I do not agree on totally ignoring raids till it has not enough player to be worth caring about, they basically made 4 new bosses in half a year, if they would have made 3 with more mechanics and harder hitting things, that would have been enough for a raid, but this is good too, hope some more people get into raids with this
---
A bit exaggerated there, but at its core so very true. Raids is where you start to see who is really invested into GW2. Sadly, its less and less people.
---
&gt;   They will never admit that. 
---
They may never admit to abandoning them (though they did admit it for dungeon) but if it were the case I really don't see any reason why Mike Z would say they were still being developed just couple month ago in an interview (german mag/streamer don't remember the exact context).
---
If you have any left i'd love one :)

Idk, your comment seems a bit more tilted than mine.

The 3 new bosses look sick [https://i.imgur.com/enQNRa3.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/enQNRa3.mp4)
---
dont you think players will feel alienated for not being able to participate in challenge mote runs though? I feel like the same players complaining that raids are toxic will just switch their argument to cms being toxic instead.
---
People with busy lives, so certain students/working adults/etc. most likely. I personally have limited time, and the only time I really spend in-game is on raid clears (lately not much due to complete lack of motivation with the shitty release schedule and focus on Strikes).
---
It's also not necessarily about not being able to play certain weeks, but that when you're able to play only 1/3rd of the entire strike content is available to you. Not just one mission being extra incentivized or something, just the rest being completely unavailable from the sound of it.
---
I wpuld love one please! I just started playing gw2!
---
Yep, also getting Hellblade vibes here
---
I'm just amazed at a lot of the mental gymnastics going on everywhere in this thread, that's all.
---
yeah this is one thing that always bugged me. At least have some cool mount skins as raid rewards...
---
Im only waiting for any new legendary weapon
---
thanks :D
---
She also Tweeted it, and it's not like LinkedIn is some private thing to be "stalked" anyway.
---
Any more of those codes left?
---
ok I guess?
---
&gt;The fact we get two masteries instead of one could be innovative, but I expect these to be map-specific so not usable anywhere else, which makes them irrelevant.
---
Well, we are staying on this map for at least a whole other episode, so there's that at least.
---
Why should they be rewarding? They are just worldbosses in an instance
---
If you say so!
---
&gt; Raids made this game much worse after all. It made us toxic. It divided our community.
---
You weren’t paying attention or weren’t around before HoT then, because the same ‘toxic’ players were there in dungeons &amp; fractals as well before we even knew GW2 was getting raids.
---
Well let them then. Not every piece of content needs to be designed for everyone. If it had to be we'd just have Grothmar Valley like maps everywhere, barely any combat, barely any failing of events, etc.
---
This is exactly why, given my current gameplay having 25% more movement speed just feels amazing given I don't seem to be close to getting mounts as of now. I can also see how having the ability to ignore direct damage for several seconds isn't too vital for leveling/PvE (except maybe world bosses but if so I can just change it once I get there anyway).
---
Got it when it first went free on Battlenet. First impression didnt make me stick around after the opening mission. 
---
Recently my GF got a new PC and I made sure to transition her to Steam so that when the move happened we could start together. She and I both did not like it. Shes very social and hated that you couldnt add any random person to the fire team unless they were on your friends list and that no  one would communicate. or that we couldn't use voice chat  with randos if we were in a fireteam. And I personally hated that I would get kicked back my ship if I left the fire team
---
Lmao
---
&gt; Fabergé
---
Is that what it is? I always thought it was a buttplug.
---
That trailer gave me goosebumps. And the entire thing had a feeling of dread to it. The more shown, the more I expected it to end with the Commander turning around for their face to become terrified due to some unseen horror. The trailer even set off feelings I get when watching a horror movie or playing a horror game. Good stuff!
---
but he mentioned raids, must be toxic!!! didn't you get the memo?!
---
Welp I'm too late for this. Thanks for doing it though!
---
They have stated in an interview that fractals and raids are still in development. Of course, we have no idea how many people are actually working on them.
---
That skeletal stag in the woods scene is definitely ‘inspired’ by Princess Mononoke.
---
Awesome specialist! Saving people from despair :) 
---
One code would be great :&gt;
---
&gt; What's the point in doing content which is unplayable for most players?
---
It's only unplayble because people lock themselves out of it. Their mind is the real raid boss.
---
Eh, I like it more than "Hero" and "Champion" you get all the time in many other games where you're a faceless legend, at least it's a rank.
---
this is exactly the reason we are playing gw2 and not the other games.
---
Oh, i'd love to get one  &lt;3
---
...No
---
Uh yikes. I’m not going to deal with that. Sorry you had to.
---
I'm still waiting for my waist long beard.
---
Tbf, her character arc might be over. She started the Vigil to kill Kralk after Kralk killed her warband, and now Kralk is dead.
---
The saddest thing is how little I feel about this. I'm disappointed of course, and concerned for the future of these gamemodes, but I'm so used to disappointment regarding GW2s endgame that it barely even registers.
---
The bulk of the game's content is open world PvE, all of which is infinitely repeatable. The LW and expac maps are especially popular given the dedicated meta events they have. Also world bosses.
---
If you're not playing most of the game's content, it makes sense that you feel there's nothing to do. And there's nothing wrong with playing that way, just that only a smaller part of the game is what appeals to you.
---
#HYPE
---
As they add more, I hope they open up the rotations, but right now it keeps the daily checklist from feeling super long, and keeps them all relevant, as when you start to have too many options, lfg groups dry up for specific ones.
---
Exactly, don't feel handcuffed to meta builds, especially in the open world where switching your skills is as easy as the click of a button.  It's not like a rated PvP game where once it starts, your skills are locked in.
---
Just remember that Signet of Stone won't do anything about damaging conditions!  If something lights you on fire or you have massive bleeding, that'll still keep ticking while you activate that Signet.
---
Well give it a try now, it is almost a new game after release of Forsaken. Just dont forget to transfer your account from Battlenet to steam if you would like to continue with your old characters. As far as social stuff goes, join the D2 LFG discord and join an active clan, you will be surprised to see how many active players are there now because of moving into steam.
---
I think the new map will actually be like a village!!! I love maps like that, it's more like old school maps where we can see how the people lived and see their architecture
---
hey i would love two codes for my friend and me (one for my friend would also be fine)
---
They just play the builds and playstyle they want man, just happens to output like 10 times the damage. 🙃
---
I mean how many training guilds did we have back in the day though? I think this is more a problem of the casual community complaining about content before even attempting it in a reasonable manner. Anet also should have placed more incentive to go through the effort of raiding imo. It seems like they gimped the exclusive weapon and armor sets a a bit to make sure they weren't shinier than items in the gemstore on purpose. The only exception to this was Dhuum's raid.
---
Something sounds off about Almorra's voice at around 0:08-0:15, I wouldn't keep my hopes up.
---
The vibe is insanely good, i like.
---
Appreciate you helping the community! don't take too many tho ;)
---
The preemptive bitching about content that's specifically not for those players, before they even know what the details will be, is absurd. Strike Missions are specifically designed for pre-raid players. So going into the Aerodome and asking for opinions is like a pro baseball player bitching that the city started a new little league team. Sit down and shut up; this content isn't meant to be challenging or relevant for you.
---
T H A N K Y O U 
---
Fuck, that furry was annoying
---
No endgame? How about strike missions? Raids are abandoned.
---
We got a trailer today.
---
https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/countdown/
---
Oh no, he does not agree with me, he is a toxic elitist.
---
Thank you for this comment.
---
Which is fine if that was applied consistently to all professions, but it isn't and hasn't been for a long time. I've sat and watched as Deadeye benchmarks are given a one-time pass and Daredevils gets ground to dust chasing an extra 1k just because people are enthused to do it.
---
That is fine, but it isn't consistent benchmarks then which is why the transparency of average logs / best logs has been requested for a while.
---
For your second question, only Rings and Backpacks can get multiple Infusion slots.  Backpacks can be Infused via the Mystic Forge for a second slot, Rings can be both Attuned and Infused via the Mystic Forge (and a certain mastery, for Attuning) for a second and third slot, in whatever order you desire.
---
Bear in mind that using those items in the Mystic Forge will remove any infusions already in the Ring and Backpack, so take those out before doing them.  You can type /wiki Ringname or /wiki Backpackname to see the exact recipes.  A couple of backpacks, most notably Mawdrey from Season Two, have much cheaper recipes for Infusion because of the difficulty required to obtain them in the first place.
---
that_shaman datamined info included HoM so they're most likely planing something for it. GW3? Naaah. Most likely HoM Lounge Pass 4k gems in your store.
---
I agree fully but that isn't the point being made.
---
When you blabber like an idiot you get talked down to like an idiot.
---
He is just here to bitch and whine.
---
Check on LFG in the ten minutes leading up to night-time.  If you don't see anyone on LFG, try organizing it yourself.  You'd be surprised how many people are out there wanting to do something but too shy to take the first step and start it!
---
You do need to get it prepared before night actually starts, though.
---
I mean the devs said that strike missions are meant to be a jumping stone to higher fractals or raids. So if people are assuming that it will be a good challenge (for those specific players), then they will more than likely be disaPPOINTED.
---
Tell me who the toxic one is: https://i.imgur.com/Zc5kDX3.jpg
---
The group that kicked the DE instantly after joining because they didn't ping "kp" to prove their experience, and then re-invited the DE back stating they would be given a single chance (because they were clearly waiting for players for over an hour)...or the DE that replied "no" after being asked to ping "kp", and didn't say a single word after, including when they carried the entire "exp" group on their back, earning them more of their precious "kp" which will go on to demonstrate their "exp" in future groups?
---
I can tell you who the real toxic community is...and it will shock you, because it's not the raiders or the actual elitist players (though there are some monkey elitists who are unnecessarily toxic); it's the wannabe elitist casuals and people that think their "kp" means something (it does not). This is extremely easy to observe when you do fractals CM &amp; T4s - it's far worse than raids. The amount of fuckery in fractals is actually absurd.
---
Didn't even notice that double kodan boss!
---
i need a good looking mace for my rev
---
"This is fixing awful if it works one way - we don't know if it works that way, but I'm gonna bitch all over the thread about it just to be safe."
---
 I'd love to have one :)
---
yes i know. but i am waiting for new gem store sales
---
Let's be honest, you clearly understand that some people find raids, even tRyHaRdiNg, fun. If you simply want all of Arenanet's development to be focused solely on your personal preferences, just say that. It would at least be less obnoxious than pretending you hadn't even considered it might be fun for someone else.
---
&gt;Raiders should have educated and encouraged casual players to join and grow the community instead of jacking each other off on how exclusive and elite their little club was. 
---
this is somehow more toxic and entitled than anything I've ever seen from even the pvp community on the forums
---
You're wrong. The game does have the capability to stop dropping an item once you've acquired it. Otherwise you'll be constantly getting duplicate items for collection achievements. Such as https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Invisible_Daredevil%27s_Mushroom_Spore and https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Queensdale_Service_Ribbon only drop once.
---
I mean, you could always keep playing a dual pistol thief at max level, but it's never going to be optimal.  It's a ranged build that only hits a single target and provides no utility, you just push 3 over and over until the target dies and hope that it dies before you do.  Compared to the other weapons Thief has, it lags behind.
---
But if you just want to play in the open world and do story missions and such, it works fine there.  If you want to do fractals and raids, you're going to need to make some friends who'll be accepting of you playing something one-dimensional like that.
---
Well the nice thing was the tiered rewards set it up as something for multiple skill levels, if they can fine tune those a bit, it might be neat.
---
If you're already doing fractals and raids consistently, then of course you're clearing the strikes without difficulty. They're literally designed to be an introduction to the things you already do.
---
Yeah that’s great on paper but how many Jumping Puzzles do you have to do to get 300g. Or reward tracks. What if I just like wandering around the world, how many vistas does it take to earn 300g.
---
Yeah got forbid I run some new dungeons or complete a quest line for armor sets or mounts. The h o r r o r.
---
The weird thing is, Fractals are already a stepping stone for high level fractals. Their Tier system is one of the better implementations of a sort of scalable difficulty.
---
i would take wing 8 on march 17th... but i doubt we will ever see wing 8
---
I guess they went on "Wendigo" inspiration.
---
That's on Anet to force people to learn basic game mechanics whilst leveling, so they are incentivized to play with both hands at the same time so by the time they got to lvl80 they see how much depth the combat system has, and can go to fractals and have fun whilst performing. Last time I remembered this was still an mmo and the goal was to progress your character and your knowledge of the game, be it vertical or horizontal progression. If you are in gw2 for the story and nothing else, let me tell you there are so many better storytelling games, you might even save some money if you opt into those instead of gw.
---
Okay. You've attacked someone on a personal level. Memory might be hard but here is where you do it;
---
&gt; I have taken the liberty of looking up some **basic reading comprehension courses** that might help you avoid similar problems in the future. 
---
Oh, look an off topic personal remark. That wasn't hard to find.
---
&gt; You had to option to respond with further discussion about mount related rewards if you had wanted to engage in discussion, but instead you opted for childism sarcasm in which you didn't so much as mention rewards, it was entirely about me. 
---
Actually, I responded about rewards. You were the one that instead of adding anything attempted a "childish" deconstruction of my post, all without once picking up on what I was saying. That is pretty impressive to be honest.
---
&gt; I can only be left thinking that you weren't one bit interested one bit in an actual discussion and just wanted to come back to put me down because you can't accept that you were wrong on the internet. 
---
Actually, I am interested in a discussion on this topic. You can see one of my other posts in this thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/duww2h/no_mount_skins_earnable_ingame/f7axitv/). There are a few dotted about. Considering the first person to try and put someone down, while contributing nothing to the discussion, was yourself you are making a bit of a rich comment. Pot calling the kettle black perhaps?
---
&gt; At any rate it isn't going to be worth my time to keep responding, I've made my point and I'm bored of you now. 
---
A point completely off topic and only related to personal attacks and deconstructing, yet still not understanding, a post. Good going. Bit of a shame you are bored. This was a fun little distraction.
---
Bye!
---
Hope so, recently had to start farming deldrimore front and noticed all these neat masteries were pretty much forgotten the moment we left.
---
Who says you can't access them all at once? Daily/Weekly Rotation doesn't work that way in Fractals or in Raids.
---
I would love to have one if it's not too late :)
---
Thanks!
---
Alternatively: Weekly rotating so it's varied. Weekly rotating so there aren't people scrambling to get different groups for different strikes, only thinning the pool as more get added. Weekly rotating so it's better.
---
I'd appreciate a code if you don't run out by the time you read this. :)
---
&gt; % that apparently plays strikes too.
---
ehm i did strike every day and did not complete the episode
---
Agreed W4 has the best overall feel, mechanics and aesthetics wise.
---
This was ACTUALLY a really good trailer. What the HELL!!
---
Nope. Trash game. No rewards.
---
Vaettir? Good eye. Based on that we can probably safely assume the new map will cover the area of at least Bjora Marches and part of Jaga Moraine, and I'd bet that it will reach Norrhart Domains as well (possibly expanding southward and/or eastward in E2). Can't wait to see how it pans out over the coming months.
---
The point of the entire Strike Mission system is not about rewards, it's about improving your skill and being an introduction to raids. Why is everything the player care about rewards, rewards, rewards? Gosh... Remember when people played for fun?
---
I'm someone that mainly raids. This content isn't meant to tide us over until the next raid release. It has an entirely different purpose. It is utterly dispiriting that you think this is supposed to be a raid replacement.
---
&gt; My goal these days is the WvW tendril armor set/legendary backpack
---
The backpack is fairly easy and painless to get, all you need it tickets which you can obtain a lot of (even by being clueless (as I was)). Rank 2200 takes a long time though... Played "a lot" for like 6 months and only got 700 wvw levels.
---
As I mentioned in another comment, if they had labelled this as "new strike each week for 3 weeks!" Then maybe the tryhards wouldn't be so salty. I personally think a rotation is the best way to keep content from going stale. I already rotate my own content choices so I'm not burning myself out on the same thing over and over
---
&lt;\_&lt; You weren't there for the last minute Disney revival they pulled on her right?
---
Check ingame or [guildwars2.com](https://guildwars2.com)
---
You mentioned that presuming a sudden switch is silly or incorrect.  People aren't presuming a sudden switch, they are presuming at least a fractal because that is the cadence that was mentioned by anet.  Sure, they never said they were going to be able to do it 100%, but by saying they were trying every 2 episodes it was essentially saying that one fractal every six months.  We are now closing in on a year without a fractal.  Strikes are fine and I don't hate them like most do, but they aren't an acceptable replacement for raids and fractals.
---
You people shit on content that is explicitly not intended for you, and then get surprised and defensive when people call you out for it. Just fuck off out of the sub already.
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Boar\_Bristle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Boar_Bristle)  would like a word...
---
As someone with limited play time, let me kindly disagree. Limited play time has very little to do with this model and is more of an impetus on being able to commit to things like raiding.
---
Cause people are so starved for new content.
---
Would love one if you have any left!
---
I would argue that Honor of the Waves story mode has more dangerous encounters than the entirety of PoF.
---
&gt;Not every piece of content needs to be designed for everyone. 
---
Says the person bitching that the Strikes aren't designed for them.
---
Yeah but long live the lich was such a meh update :( we got the beetle, but the map was not to my liking
---
coming from wow, surely you realize that wow has plenty of great mount skins earnable in game. I believe OP is aware anet is a company and not a charity.
---
I personally spent a decent amount of money on gw2 cosmetics, on top of paying for both expansions. I've bought a bunch of mount skins, including a 2k gems one. I still think there should be at least basic 4-channel skins available as a reward in game.
---
&gt;I understand that this subreddit is not strictly related to esports but, since it has a gamer user-base, there may be some who watch/participate in esports. I’m also posting the survey on esports-related subreddits but, from a researcher standpoint, only posting there would mean that I'd only be inquiring the most enthusiastic esports fans, which would introduce a bias. In this sense, it is also important to place the survey on general gaming subreddits where people who simply like esports (but are not enthusiastic about them) may also exist and participate.
---
not really true. you do have to hit a certain DPS to kill most bosses before enrage or it's a wipe. Gorse, Xera and MO will insta-wipe past enrage. Sam, VG, Demios, KC, Sab (I'm sure I'm missing some) are very punishing basically ohk after enrage. yes some bosses are heavily mechanic based (Cairn, Sloth, Matthias etc.) but those are heavy mechanical bosses which should have a less punishing enrage timer imho and are fine. yes there are people who have solo'ed some of the ones I listed but they spent the vast majority just surviving and cheesing the fight. DPS is king, it will always be king because of the mechanics drop sharply as you increase DPS, it's the same with 99/100CM.
---
In which case, I'm not the target of anything, apparently. They clearly don't want to do anymore fractals, either, since the last one was over 10 months ago, and it was an absolute shitshow.
---
It's not me.
---
If you dont want to craft you can always try raiding for armor and weapons
---
I said “new” dungeons. The best MMOs release a new batch of content alongside new rewards so that you’re not running the same dungeons from 2012 over and over like you do in GW2.
---
What content do you like doing?
---
The army killed my family members.
---
I think it's more like "old forest"
---
Wasted Potential. Sad reality.
---
&gt; Weekly rotation is pretty fucking shit for people with limited time to play.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; It's just a big fuck you to people who want more replayable instanced content to play each week. 
---
Those points seem a little contradictory. Is it an issue for people with limited time to play, or is it an issue for people that don't have limited time and are looking for more things to do?
---
I'd hazard that its actually the latter but if you want to have your cake and eat it...
---
Meta battle, snow crows, godsofpvp and I think discretize have all add chat codes for their trait templates.
---
I’ve 100% added random people to my fireteam before without adding them. Sounds like you didn’t adjust your fireteam settings or you wanted to play with someone who had their fireteam settings set to friends/clan only or to off.
---
ESO just released a new zone, dungeon, and two earnable motifs (armour/weapon styles) just recently.
---
GW2 very much lags behind when it comes to dungeons.
---
Interesting, Destiny 2 held my attention for about one afternoon. We're all different after all.
---
Lol, seriously? Exactly what's entitled about my post?  Entitlement implies I want or have claimed the right to something, and that would be... what exactly?
---
My post is entirely about other peoples conduct, I expect and ask for nothing in it. I can understand if what I've described is not your experience but but if you want to share you opinion, actually have one first instead if just throwing out the first buzz word that comes to mind.
---
I could really use one since there is no Quiznos here in Germany
---
TIL finishing your part of the Meta Event sabotages said Meta Event.
---
There’s a lot of bus from other MMOs because of expansion releases or announcements.
---
GW2 very much lags behind in content.
---
I like Raids, Dungeons, Fractals, Open World and a bit of WvW. PvP can be fun, but I don't play it all that often. And I like that I'm not forced to grind some specific maps for most rewards. I don't like that for some rewards, I have to play content, that's just not fun to me.
---
I get why they add it. Because a lot of players want to be forced to do content. Just personally, I think that's rather moronic.
---
&gt; Miyukinya: lol
---
&gt; Miyukinya: It works
---
&gt; Miyukinya: and seems dike fully
---
You don’t like having to run dungeons endlessly for rewards but how many times have you done CoF or the Charr fractal since 2013.
---
[Metabattle.com](https://Metabattle.com) has started including the copy-paste code for builds! I can't vouch whether every single build has the code, but I noticed they seemed to have started quickly, on day 1 of the build-template release. Very nifty.
---
True, you have to go into each individual build's page and scroll down to the appropriate section, rather than have a massive excel spreadsheet. I actually like that though... I wouldn't recommend anyone blindly apply builds without reading the description, options, gear, and so on. Some builds rely on odd mechanics or interactions, so blindly popping "PvP Mirage" (or whatever it is) might not go so well.
---
Everyone expects ANet to cater to their specific needs...everyone...everywhere...with everything.
---
ANet, can you halt all your projects, activities, and plans, and prioritize my needs over others. Thanks!
---
Oh, you can't? What a trash company.
---
I mean during the strike mission you have a buff saying that it's too cold for you to use mounts :P
---
Already got the legendary PvP tendrils and backpack so gotta work for something on the long term again so that’s why I picked the legendary WvW this time. 
---
Rank 2k is a long haul but it’s fine by me. (You want it to actually mean something so the rank req is good).
---
Nope I don’t play the pve like fractals or raids so I personally can’t get the other legendary armor/backpack.
---
I just checked you are correct
---
There have been raid training discords around since late 2017 on the NA side and early 2016 on the EU side.
---
The wendigo looks awesome!
---
Micro transactions in the dark. Losing a half your dev team in the dark.
---
thought the title was custom and a bit snarky... turns out it's unironically the title of the blog post. funny how all those *packages* count amongst the most expensive and least worthwhile purchases - particularly due to the useless crap that serves to justify a greedily inflated price - that were ever available on the store, only offer their main value (outfit and other unlocks) once per account, and are still supposedly some of the most popular purchases. *wat?!*
---
I am sorry for your country.
---
Yeah great - 3 bosses you can kill once a day to get rewards that they won’t sell on the gem store.
---
It is too hard for Anet. They draw another skin for  shop. They have no time. xD
---
This is being reported as exploits but a chat system isn't an exploit.
---
As with all third party addons, use at your own risk.
---
I saw your comment before I saw the post.
---
Rest in Piece.
---
&gt; Have players struggle at first
---
And it will be HoT all over agian, with forum flooded with mass crying to nerf everything.
---
“Venture deeper into the Far Shiverpeaks where you and your allies must stand together against the storm and face terrors that will leave you frozen in fear,” ArenaNet promises. The video teases the new Bjora Marches map, the Raven Attunement and Essence Manipulation masteries (there are apparently two more beyond these two), the Ancient Boreal weapon set and “Raven-inspired exotic scepter skin,” three bosses for the rotating strike missions, and of course, a bit of nostalgic flair as it’s all set in a classic *Guild Wars* setting. My favorite part? ArenaNet is promising “a campfire s’mores roasting kit.” This is from [Massively.com](https://Massively.com)'s article on this the parts I'm most interested in is the masteries part there are apparently two more beyond these two? what does that mean.
---
Why would you need that? In GW1 I know pvx had this, but downloading the full package in txt form made the entire library available accross all accounts and characters. There is no such thing in GW2 and even if there was, with limited build storage slots even if you purchased the maximum amount of slots you couldn't possibly get all the builds from any of the sites.
---
Git gud
---
You've got a good eye ;) Yeah, I'm basically doing a "half swot analysis" :) Thank you so much for the kind words of encouragement :D
---
They told you “play a better game.”
---
I'm not saying that we shouldn't have representation, I'm just saying it should just be a natural thing. In a fantasy world where Christianity and the normal prejudices of earth born human cultures don't exist, you'd figure it'd be way, way more common, not an anomaly needing to be recorded. 
---
It's hard to explain you know? Simultaneously not wanting to be ignored, yet not wanting to pelvic thrust my rainbow ass into people's faces.
---
playing casually = game is right up your alley
---
If strike missions get actual mechanics and become failable, they'll automatically turn into raids. Shitty single boss reused content raids, but still raids with all that comes with them.
---
There is no reason for strike missions to exists, other than rebranding raids, while making them accessible enough for flat worms and slightly stale bread. All "improvements" strike missions brough couldhave been easily implemented in raids.
---
Chrome tells me your link is phishy.
---
Well it's early evening for him so probably putting a video together and rendering it
---
 I think that Jormag helped the Elder Races forge the bloodstone. Perhaps they did a deal with Jormag and the other terrestrial dragons to spare them from the DSDs upcoming onslaught.
---
Who does autoattacks on strike bosses? I practice full raid rotations on Icy
---
If you only have time to do one thing a month the game is great.
---
I know I can find a strike group and fill it a lot quicker than I can find a raid training group

The items you don’t get from playing the game are back!
---
How often are they putting Fractal content out?  Are Fractals like mini-dungeons?  
---
What are strike missions? Are these new to Guild Wars 2?
---
This. Pure gold my friend.
---
[First item in the carousel on the frontpage.](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/)
---
GW2 got great aesthetics, and I liked the painterly backgrounds and cutscenes from vanilla a lot and was sad to seem a lot of them replaced with in-game ^unskippable dialogues and 3D "cinematic" trailers that really showed how the game aged and didn't convey that same feel. So touches like that are quite welcome, and I hope we get more of this style further on - maybe even in the UI parts of the game?
---
Game is good, still a lot of players.
---
Fractals did got a lot of upgrades through the years, and a lot of new ones as well. Even some challenge motes. Then, expansions also added raids that are in difficulty above fractals.
---
Dungeons stayed same, as it is low man content, and this game is MMO, the main focus of devs is naturally on content for many player at once. Fractals and raids fully took over the "dungeon" mechanics.
---
There is like double the open world maps than there was back then, so a lot of stuff to do.
---
All instanced content is not meant to be overpowered by any items you can get. In this game, only your personal skill matters, how you make your build and if that build is apropriate for encounter, and how it synergies with your party. This is skill based game, not "now I looted super sword and can oneshot everything" game. After such long pause, you might struggle a lot until you re-learn controls, how to dodge, how to use skills, which skills when, how to buff each other, and such.
---
However, each of expansions granted us with new build possibilities, so there is very big palette of tools to use, and how to build your party. I would definitely check it out again, however you need to keep your "typical mmo" mindset at the doors. Only your wit and skills will help you there, not the numbers. The party synergy is big focus and can yield even like 10-20x better outputs compared to random people who won't care about it at all.
---
Strikes are the new "challenging" content.
---
Well don't buy it if you don't like it. It's a free market economy that we live in.
---
Strike missions are “end game content” that are designed as a stepping stone to raids because T1 fractals are too hard
---
Fractals have been dead for a long time because they keep making older ones unrecognizable and harder than they need to be. Molten Boss is one of the long fractals now and I won't even touch aquatic because it is a nightmare.
---
The forgotten are probably former minions of the DSD. They might be the big bad.
---
Kinda? One might argue that it's skirting the line, just like GW1 did back then.
---
The most jaring thing about D2, is that the chat is disabled by default. This leads to an incredibly limited amount of interaction in-game, and you really have to go out of your way (discord, forums, bungie.net) to get a guild. Outside of a guild, 95% of interactions will be emotes.
---
Unless you're in the Tower (the only hub of the game), you will rarely see more than 7 players around at any given time.
---
In a way, it's kinda like playing GW2 open world solo : you will see a player every now and then, emote some random shit, and go about your day.
---
I mean one fractal a year is not what they said for their cadence.  It seems like abandoned content at this point.  Raids are once a year so w.e, I don't expect more than that.
---
Man,  reddit is gonna have a field day with this one.
---
You're breathtaking!
---
Best of luck in the new job! I hope you have many fun, challenging projects ahead of you that you can feel proud of. Your mark has been made on GW2 forever and it is appreciated.
---
i played the hell out of it (hoping it would get better eventually) and gave up around september 2018, i played again recently with friends and it feels almost exactly the same, the only thing that really feels different is that you have more arbitrary numbers to chase after with the addition of random rolls. it seems like they would rather just make everything RNG to keep people playing for longer rather than design the game better. the cash shop has also gotten worse, as has the rate at which you acquire the loot boxes by  just playing the game.
---
&gt; Jora’s Keep may be the only refuge from the storm—if it can stand.
---
The new meta?
---
Idk, is this account legit?
---
If it is, thanks for confirming (again) that ANet abandoned everything but open world.
---
As for actually stating that, are you sure it's of no harm to you?
---
yeah i mean i'm mostly trying to have the builds at hand and to try them out ; also switching between them is a pain cause i cant use the internet when in game crap pc ; i did make a wvw one from [vabbi.eu](https://vabbi.eu) just wondering when i mgoing from diff game modes etc.
---
Redditor for 55 mins. First post on account. Sceptical.
---
I am glad you tried raids because of it, but strikes have zero pressure to finish quickly because with one or two half decent players you will easily finish in the time limit.  The unique rewards would be great as well if it wasn't just 100% rng.  I don't hate strikes, but in the current state they are a 10man tier 1 fractal boss.
---
low quality bait
---
I like the way we've got this, a few nice screenshots as well, perfect for WPs video!
---
it's being referred to as an mmo by the devs now, and sure the social aspect are pretty different but in terms of systems design and the grind stuff it's absoloutely there. it's closer to old mmos where you need to play specific content for specific (non-cosmetic) rewards than gw2 is.
---
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Boss Dead

More info here: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/november-19-2019/
---
For some reason, the mood of this trailer.. it kind of reminds me of the feels and nostalgia of when Harry Potter started getting darker.
---
Weren't both these fractals changed in response to the players actively trying to farm them?
---
New Strike Mission: Gay Furry Couple.
---
I don't believe that, strikes are just easier to implement. They're reusing story bosses and just tuning them up.
---
What do you mean they adjusted the old ones to be harder?  Are they still going do new ones?
---
"Jora’s Keep may be the only refuge from the storm—if it can stand."
---
Found the new meta!
---
This is not the official account. Official account is u/CrystalRAID
---
With the difference that the goal is not to git gud, but to change the way you engage the situation: by avoidance rather than confrontation.
---
Like horror games generally work, you know. GTFO ASAP.

---
If they so "challenging" as the last one, couldn't care less about 3 rotating strokes.
---
Well, in his case, he will have 6 years of content to choose from. That can take few thousands of hours...
---
How does a Strike mission compare to a Fractal?
---
Wow! That would be a sight to see.
---
He is a Baron but didn't tell anyone. He plays the marketplace instead of playing the game. Sure, you can be rich, but you have to give up gameplay to do that. Gameplay should provide wealth, but it doesn't when  compared to flipping.
---
you still got people who've been playing for years, running around in their masterwork armour and expecting to be carried through end game content and inevitably whining when people refuse and you think saying that people don't know how to play the game is somehow bad? toxic casuals, yikes
---
I think Fractals and Raids are going to be one of the smaller updates that they talked about in the announcement remember they said they can choose what is a release now with the saga. So we could get episode 1 this week then in 2 weeks a new fractal.
---
Quiznos is so far away... they closed all of mine.. my nearest is 5 hours away... I know its late. but either way thanks for caring for the community.
---
Easier than T1
---
Lmao yeah, look at the monkey below... “BREATHTAKING”
---
You do know more than 200 million people speak Russian right?
---
Yea Crystal Reid isn't this shit with basic English
---
until there is a verification i would be skeptical as well especially if the account has _anet when she left anet
---
ok, boomer
---
No you're breathtaking
---
I hope you get to do what you love again, and that it is met with as much success and appreciation or more as your time here with Guild Wars 2.
---
I loved raids, until they stopped coming and my friends have all left the game. Likewise the direction of the game has made it hard for me to stay engaged. But what you gave us will still be in our memories. Thank you.
---
Because if Strike Missions are just like the open-world stuff where giant groups of people just stand around and DPS, then that is weak content compared to raid like mechanics.
---
Eh, I'm indifferent. I set aside just enough time with my group to only do bonus wings and nothing else. In that way it really makes no difference to me with these weekly rotating strikes. Not that these strikes are going to be full featured raids or anything but still. I don't care for doing every single raid wing every week. I don't have time for that.
---
Raids also started with 3 bosses every few months.
---
Its so awesome. I would be scared if I saw that running towards me.
---
But that’s exactly what strike missions are. You stand around DPSing and there’s no mechanics
---
Whether intentional or not, your comment proclaimed your vaunted superiority over the unwashed, pitiable masses. I guess human nature will never change; regardless of the arena, each separate individual will seek validation through elevation over the norm. It's been this way for thousands of years.
---
Just watched a video of a strike.  They look like pretty weak and easy to make content.  It's just a 10-party DPS spam?  I hope they didn't abandon making Fractals for that.
---
I don't : ). I just crafted ascended armor + rings + accessories + amulet. Back and weapons is still missing.
---

---
destiny 2 isn't a great game by any definition of the word but the story isn't anywhere near as bad as gw2s. this is all irrelevant, however. the fact remains that we have seen quite a few senior employees leaving the company after years of decline and a series of fiascoes and if you take an honest look at the situation then you will realise there is something going on and it's not looking good.
---
Good trailer but no new fractal or raid
---
The Ultimate Challenge
---
you don't have to have a particular comp for raids though lol
---
I am very whelmed by this announcement.
---
the sad thing is that gw2 didn't have to be at the end of its lifespan, we could have had years of more expansions, yet anet with their braindead decisions take us here, to kill their only revenue stream.
---
The pressure to finish quickly comes from wanting to get all of the bonus chests. You actually do need to be trying if you want to output enough DPS to meet that. One or two experienced people may only barely be able to get you to finish in time. And most groups I end up in are actually putting effort in. I see banners, spirits, boon uptime, healing, etc.
---
They were just bland, boring Fractals, *and they still are*.  I think it had little to do with them having farm potential (Aquatic, Molten Boss etc)  People just moved onto Mai Trin (42) or whatever.
---
ok but if the mount skin has a value of say 500g in game (corresponding to 2000gems), then that drop needs to be so rare that most people will never have it drop. Therefore they need to buy it with gold anyway.
---
Don't expect the balance patch for a few more weeks. It was like that last time as well.
---
The only reason they are posting now is to gauge feedback.
---
Out of the loop here, what makes you think this will be the new meta?
---
I hope there is a code left from me.
---
Now that is...interesting.
---
Doubt there are any left, but I would love a code.
---
I really REALLY want them to take advantage of the tech they had for the Shadowstone quest line, RE: spawning random, client-side hallucinations that nobody else can see except you.
---
I always felt like the anomaly hallucinations introduced a good bit of horror that the rest of the game never had. Seeing things, pointing them out, and nobody else knowing what you're talking about is great.
---
Feels a bit like Thunderhead Keep / Silverwastes. Take it, defend it, hold it, retreat to some camp at the edge of the map if you lose it, start all over again. Just without an 'end' to the map.
---
I guess I was hoping that after two years they would have added more to that load out.  Ah well.
---
Currently there is only one Strike Mission in the game and it's really easy. Many hope that the next ones to come and this one will be a bit harder.
---
It's available after you finish the story for the Bound By Blood prologue, and not hard at all to find groups for it, ask on map chat and post it on the lfg
---
It's like people don't understand that after a while people will stop doing them because they are old content. Remakes do nothing for me and remaking them to be even harder or more annoying isn't going to help that.
---
I know the pressure to finish is to get the chests, but the cutoff is extremely lenient.
---
Anything before the outfit dam broke is worth purchasing.
---
very bleak future. if you are planning on playing and not really getting invested at all then this is a good game for you, if you want to play a game that has competent devs and a bright future, or even an average future ahead of it, you are in the wrong place. there have been no new dungeons since launch, there have been a few fractals but you may have to grind a bit for ascended armour if you want to do the higher level ones.
---
I think it's protection from the pact in the sense that the pact is constantly sending their people to die in wars that aren't a direct threat to their people, yet. Something like "If they cared about you then why didn't they come to your and when you needed it?"
---
Any Codes left?  if so i would love to have one..  :)
---
I'd take one if u still have. Cheers.
---
I got you for three minutes! Three minutes of PLAY TIME!
---
So how come GW1 was so popular there? Korean districts were some of the most populated, especially when it comes to PvP - many Korean guilds were the top dogs of PvP.
---
did yet wvw and basic pvp and fractals, not raiding yet. should give that a try!
---
Starting fractals are already easier than open world content and I've heard several players absolutely refuse to even try them for "intimidation factor".
---
I don't know how much easier you can get before just playing a cutscene of your commander 1-shotting things and getting high-fives for it.
---
They added new ones as well, last one is Siren's reef. But yes, in general, the new fractals nad reworks are a bit tougher. For example the new Aquatic really needs to have proper underwater builds or you might not beat them at all.
---
Let me translate the blog post
---
"Defend Jora's keep so it doesn't fall"
---
New meta
---
Where da cyka blyat at?
---
Like when I played Dead Space 3 with a friend, and suddenly he'd go "WTF is up with these creepy dolls man!" and I'd go "Wut? What dolls?".
---
This place is saltier than a pirate's tackle-bag
---
Probably, which makes this even more dumb on their part. Players are going to always find the easiest way to make gold. Doing this just makes players upset.
---
Well, right now there's only one strike mission, and it was kinda braindead easy. Anet said they plan to make strikes evolve so hopefully that means they'll be more challenging. We have yet to see what they mean by that.
---
Out of curiosity, would this addon also work with other languages, such as Japanese, Korean, Arabic?
---
&gt;Team A takes a keep and leaves. Team B would take the undefended keep and leave. Team A would return and retake the undefended keep. If I happened to stay behind and defend, I would get hate tells for ruining the keep farming. Is it still like that?
---
I don't see this much anymore.
---
WvW is teamfights and capping, defense happens more than it did when you played. There've been big changes like mounts, and elite specs. 
---
WvW is still around on higher pop servers, lower pop ones are quite empty atm. There has been a large feature in the works for a while now called "Alliances" that will basically remove servers, let you mark 1 guild as your WvW guild, and assign guilds to one of the 3 colored teams (that's my loose understanding).
---
If there's a big time to return for WvW, it'll be with Alliances. We don't know when it's coming, it's a major rework, and it was announced a loooong time ago, but devs are still on it.
---
For what its worth there are mechanics to it, including an enrage that will down players. And we know a CM is coming.
---
Shattered Observatory, Siren's Reef &amp; Twilight Oasis are some of the most poorly understood Fractals that ArenaNet has ever developed.  They're super fun for the practiced, rational-deductive Fractal player-base and *hell* for players that have a shit understanding of how the gameplay works; boon/condition; stability/resistance, protection-strip/corrupt.  Ughhh.  When you add extra mechanics like Green, Marble, Bomb that require actual awareness?  Yikes man.
---
I would love one thank you !
---
Oh, I see. I was unaware that's it's just flipping one switch. I wonder why they couldn't do it for every language if it's this easy.
---
Bjora Marches was the Map were Jora cleansed her bloodline in the Bear shrine by thrashing quite a lot of charr. It was very cool seeing the new models of charr. One of my charr is modeled after those. [Stone Wardkeeper](https://i.imgur.com/bfAJTNtl.png), after [Charr Wardkeepers](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/8/86/Charr_elementalist.jpg)  
---
Like Grothmar, it also had an entrance to a dungeon. I wonder if they'll ever add any raids using any of those entrances.  
---
Looks like we are getting one exploration mastery and one combat mastery. But I fear these things will likely be only used in their respective maps, and if used  ever again, only in future maps.  
---
They really need to stop with that, they need to refurbish portions of old maps with new improvements and designs. 
---
Hopefully the strike missions will ramp up in difficulty. The current Strike is a good start, but it's just that, a start. If it doesn't take off, it will end up as nothing.
---
Looks like there will be more uses of the norn transformation models as enemies. They better get Braham to transform, never seeing Eir's red wolf transformation was bad enough, we've got to see at least Braham's.
---
no, that is a common misconception that i saw pointed out in someone elses comment a few days ago. there has been 6 years in which content has been released, not necessarily 6 years worth of content. thousands of hours? sure, if you like grinding meaningless and boring achievements, not if you like doing actual content. i have less than 2 k hours in this game and i have done everything there is to do except raids, which would not add a whole lot more time (probably a couple hundred hours at the most)
---
Relevant picture every time someone says "toxic" and "tryhard"
---
https://i.imgur.com/uJMC0K7.png
---
Ded gaem going strong I see
---
Strikes are in 10man format as rais are, and ffractals are just 5man. 
---
First strike mission was easy and mechanics weren't really punishable, but that might change with the new ones.
---
I do most dps than the average pug just by autoattacking on my warr while i'm alt tabbed
---
Not that many players, only some small groups. But they got too much profit from too little real effort, too fast, and so it got addressed pretty before it would spread as much as other repeated gimmicks, like back when CoF1 was way more repeatable.
---
There is literally no evidence for fractals being abandoned for strikes. People are just saying it because we haven't gotten a fractal in a while.
---
What you said is all true, I am not disagreeing with any of it. I just dont think its as universal as you think in that both reward approaches have their own design issues, the same issues really only the motivator will change. Like you correctly said if rewards are tied to gold you'll have a large number of players who will gravitate towards content that has the largest Gold / Hour. Like wise if rewards are tied to content then they'll gravitate towards the more desirable rewards especially if you have must have rewards like best in slot gear etc... Difference is with the open design you have options. If I choose a less rewarding content because I am burned out repeating the same stuff, I can still progress towards the reward even though I am playing other less optimum content. If the reward I want is tied to say Raids, I have no choice. Either I raid or I am not progressing towards my reward. 
---
Also while you're right Its impossible to balance out gold/hour you can tweak it if it starts going into a direction you dont like. That has its own issues ofcourse, people will complain, accuse you of being greedy etc..  but its an option that the other model doesnt really have, not exactly doesnt have, no one is really stopping developers from moving a rewards thats say only available in raids to another type of content but if they do they will likely alienate a lot more people in my opinion. With the open design you can also control it indirectly through gold sinks and just pressing the right buttons in the economy. Over all I'd say gw2 is doing quite well in this department, it has over the years controlled inflation pretty well. Its not perfect, there definitely is content thats preferred due to its optimum farming potential but people engage in all kind of content.
---
&gt; are still supposedly some of the most popular purchases
---
I'd believe that. They wouldn't bundle junk if it didn't increase sales, and the target market of the game is casual gem-store habitual spenders.
---
hmm thanks, i can work with that!
---
&gt;  So, the game engine and chat support Unicode UTF-16. We found that if you write a message in Russian, the chat system accepts it but does not show it. Just because the game client does not have a font with Cyrillic support.
---
So much for people saying that "[it's just encoded differently](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dad78d/appeal_of_the_russianspeaking_community_guild/f1p302f/?context=1)". Adding a couple dozen Cyrillic characters to a Latin font isn't that much of a deal - you can either redraw them based off of the Latin ones in a day or two (unless there's some eh, third-party license restriction?..), or append a different set entirely like they often do for Chinese.
---
Which makes me think that it's more of an... **"obligation" issue**, since officially adding these characters would imply that they now *should* be able to police reports written in unsupported languages, as well as change their spam and swear filters to account for substitution of identically-looking glyphs.
---
Mallyx is fine roaming and is decent in zergs if you know what you’re doing with it. I mean it’s certainly not meta but let’s not pretend it’s some sort of dumpster fire or in need of huge changes. 
---
And regardless, bugs should not be left unfixed simply because other things need work too. CoR is an absolute mess at the moment
---
where are the fractals?
---
The first strike was really easy, as the boss was nearly fully trapped in ice....they said that difficulty be definitely higher with new strikes. The first one was easy probably just to try lure more people into it, many people just don't ever want to try out very easy T1 fractals, as for their performance fears...
---
The future doesnt look bright with so many important devs leaving even after all those layoffs.
---
Looks like the game is going more and more into maintenance mode with a smaller getting skeleton crew...
---
I mean fact is they already put GW2 in maintenance mode shortly after PoF and while they said they want to put all of their focus on gw2 again, after the layoffs, we didnt saw anything in the game development this year, with would suggest they invested their 200 employers into the game development...
---
When you are complaining about no new dungeons, then you are not talking about reward structure. And that's where you went in your argument.
---
How dungeons fit in the reward structure and how often new dungons get released are two different topics. Randomly throwing them around in a discussion doesn't really help you make a coherent point.
---
white knights and strawman arguments going strong I see
---
so being able to speak with other players in an MMO is a "specific need" apparently
---
 Many people who are not familiar with the Russian language write this phrase, but it is really a strong obscene word in our language. If you wrote something similar in English, then you would definitely be banned :)
---
I feel like youre blowing things out of proportion over a video game. All i said was that there is a lot of people who have no idea how the game works, which is a entirely true statement
---
P I C N I C.
---
It should ideally be account bound drop. That way the drop rate can be increased a bit and some guy swiping his creditcard cant get it instantly.
---
&gt; Feels a bit like Thunderhead Keep / Silverwastes.
---
Maybe more of Dragon's Stand, judging from the overall tone of the story.
---
Cool rewards are there!  I mean, chance is 0.01% and you aren't going to get them, but someone else will and you could buy it off tp! Feelsgood.
---
The builds you describe are the one shining reason I thought that despite the incredible shortcomings of templates, I would at least have a use for them.
---
But no, even when we *don't use* a change in templates - even manually changing the traitline will uncharge our mantras.
---
It is awesome! I hope [Arena.net](https://Arena.net) listen to russian-speaking gamers!
---
When do we know the next weapons for each class? :) Any info that I have missed out?
---
What does the code get you?
---
While visually pleasing, it is still nothing I'm really interested in. Again we get new map, new mastery and few new skins, exactly as it was with Living World episodes. I don't see anything new in this "saga" concept, other than new name.
---
The whole article is editorial in nature lmao
---
Thank you for your answer. I'll be sure to do that
---
as a raider and someone with quite high AP, i sadly have to agree
---
Why are you saying that?
---
Can you name an alternative skill-based MMO that can be played casually without all the gear grind?
---
Haha appreciate it
---
I like earning new rewards tied to new content, rather than farming old content for gold to get new rewards.
---
Thanks
---
Actually, I'm a millennial...just not a self-entitled idiot like majority of the clowns using the internet.
---
Got any more excuses for your behaviours?
---
there are mechanics, but they barely hurt people in full glasscannon gear. so for openworld players that tend to run vit/toughness it hruts even less. Which is a shame, just because it's casual friendly doesnt mean there shouldn't be atleast one instawipe mechanic that introduces u to that which can be made super obvious and have like 15sec casting time before the attack lands.
---
I believe [Ornery Crabs](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ornery_Crab) have a similar mechanic, and will run away and hide if you /threaten them.
---
I will gladly take one if you still have any code left. You're cool anyways!

Could also be the [Boneskinner](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Boneskinner), who “throws its voice to trick its prey.” Might not actually be her also...
---
Gah, look at how bleak that map looks. I am super stoked for the themes of this story going forward. Looks unsettling, eerie, and excellent. Can't wait.
---
They don't want us to repeat content to farm gold to convert to gems because they lose money.
---
I played GW2 a bit at launch and stopped a little after Fractals/ Season 1 (can't remember which was later) came out. Her guides were instrumental in helping me learn the fractals and also some of the more tricky JPs (curse you, Aetherblade one in Genderran Fields).
---
I came back and started to look up her site again only to see no updates since earlier this year, which was a bit sad but I hope she's doing well.
---
very nice answer, thanks! i didn't realize this cutting edge thing for example, have got a bunch of the required stuff yet for it :) no worries about spoilers here, finished all main story lines yet, only lws ones not fully.
---
They are not making any more. Gen 2 was the last set and it is done.
---
Well, you pretty much answered your question yourself. Because of PvP.
---
The PoF events got buffed rewards (amalgamated gemstones) so it's easier to get people to do them. Maw of Torment is still bugged and useless half the time, though.
---
Probably, you'll likely need to do a lot of the story to unlock the masteries.
---
Plus, for me, I'm plaything through GW2 for the story/content and less so about the endgame
---
i would like to get one
---
I think OP is referring to the saga announcement back when things started to shape up. Fractals weren't mentioned there or were they?
---
Mostly things the majority of players need. Consumables, runes, sigils, complex crafting materials. Things that sell well in mass. 
---
People tend to think we're only doing legendaries or other elusive high end items, but in reality you can generate comparable amounts of gold crafting basic stuff
---
There were some stupid choices made for the recipes. They should either stop dropping once unlocked(that does seem to be the case for the core sigil/rune recipes so code to do this already exist ...)or they should drop unbound.
---
most won't agree with you with Shattered since it's probably one of the best designed fractals regarding boss encounters ever.
---
Siren's Reef on the other hand, that's one hell of a shit fractal for the most part.
---
There's lots of obscure little details like those.
---
For example, Risen Abominations are not immune to "Launch" even though their description implies they are, so they can be thrown around like a sack of potatoes. Pretty fun having a guardian with a hammer near them.   
---
Also, they will get stunned and lose all their rage stacks if they fail to hit 4 times in a row. You can blind them or evade their attacks 4 consecutive times, and if they hit nothing, they get stunned for 3s. 
---
There's also lots of hidden scripted behaviors and events that only start when you do something in the world. For example, in Fireheart Rise you can start a champion event by killing 2 veteran skales southwest from Tuyere. You can kill a bear who is eating someone's picnic near Jeb's Wheatfield in Queensdale. There's some spots in which killing some imps summons one or more veteran imps, and in some of those spots also killing the veteran imps summons a champion. There's a tomb in Malchors Leap north from the melandru statue with all the tree nodes that will start an event if you /kneel next to it while the skulls in the tomb have shining eyes.  And there's a statue of Dwayna in Gendarran Fields where you can light up a candle and kneel to summon a servant of Dwayna to start an event.
---
Nice, been waiting for Black Lion Garden Plot Deed
---
Yeah, neither are once a year. That's what irks me with these claims about the content being abandoned as it just shows a complete lack of understanding previous release patterns. Raids have been consistently 9 months for three and a half years (SotF to BotP) so the complaints are either out of date or inaccurate to make a shitty point that doesn't need to be made.
---
You can criticise the release cadence of anything in this game without "one per year" exaggeration.
---
Wasn't that episode 2?
---
 I would love a code or 2 as well if there are any available. Thank you, kind sir!
---
Definition of "study"
---
&gt; the devotion of time and attention to acquiring knowledge on an academic subject
---
Study describes this post accurately.  He's not conducting an experiment or testing a hypothesis with hopes of submitting his work to a journal for publication.  You as a scientist should be able to recognize the distinction.
---
Well. RIP Almorra. O7
---
Can I get one please?
---
Does that continue to drop after BOTH Bifrost and Dreamer collections are completed?
---
The story was pretty badass tho :P
---
&gt; I see I've encountered a special kind of idiot.
---
You're not helping your case...internet points must be important to you.
---
Not being touched by more than 90% of the playerbase if the opposite of inclusive. Don't make stuff up, please.
---
Almorra's arc is to be the last thing standing after every damn explosion/dragon attack in this game.
---
sure does
---
or other recipe sheets like the previously drop/salvage only runes and sigils like rune of balthazar
---
who cares your phd survey go do it anywhere else.i will troll your survey gladly.
---
Missions? There is a second one? Quantity also does not equal quality ...
---
So how does it work? Are yo hoking into gw2 and reading the incoming messages..if so..are you going to make that add-on open source?
---
It looks cold and silent. It's perfect. Let nothing stop the Shiverpeaks from hearing me roar.
---
I'm a pretty casual player but the only reason I don't do fractals is because they feel disjointed and separate from the rest of the game. Strike missions directly connected to Open World really scratch that old dungeon itch for me, I'll play them even if they get much harder.
---
Link GW2 efficiency so we can see what you got.
---
But I would argue that no game has more than a couple hundred ours of content at most.
---
Had to check the vod, you are right it is episode 2.
---
Raids are very much playable and easier than in other mmos.
---
The problem is not their difficulty, is GW2 allowing players to cruise from 0 to 80 without ever having to read a skill tooltip or force them to hone and improve their ability as a player. So when they decide to try fractals, raids, or pvp, turns out 90% are complete ass at the game, they hit a wall that feels insurmountable, and complain that it is too hard.
---
Population is still unbalanced and not really in a good shape, but for smallscale fights and above i would say its way better than when you left the game.
---
The lag is also not that bad anymore as it was when you left.
---
Thanks for making all my favorite wings.. except Xera. I hate that lady :D
---
Posting this here as you deleted the comment before I was able to respond.
---
I care. I reckon other people care as well as this is not the only thread about this topic, and its an MMO**RPG** we are playing so there should be people that care about this aspect of the game.
---
Lore explanation about gem store items would be just empty words to me. Do you think they can 'cook up something' as satisfying as getting a mount from a boss that rides it in fight, or from a raid/fractal that shares a similar theme with text behind UI? Do you think it would be the same if Molten weapons, rather than being obtainable from Citadel of Flame, were sold in gem store with some 'lore friendly' explanation as to how Black Lion Company got them from Flame Legion? Why should I care how the Black Lion Company got some mount skin, if it doesn't involve me or allow me to contribute to the story? 
---
I mean its clear you don't care and it shows.

i don't trust certain people on this sub so i won't be associating my gw2 account with this reddit account
---
just a example, but you can make 40-50g/h by just refining mithril. Afcourse, thats not always available, but look at price fluctuations during weekends - this should give you some ideas.
---
Shattered and Twilight Oasis are masterpieces in their own right. I felt TO was a really fun boss fight, love it. Siren's reef on the other hand.....
---
Heyo would love a code! Thank you for taking time to share with us
---
Still one code left?
---
You are in the wrong place to ask this question. According to this sub, the game has been dying for at least half a decade.
---
Good for you big strong independent raider you. Keep stroking your ego and putting down "mere plebs" all the way up to the announcement that raids are no longer being developed, that'll show those filthy casuals.
---
&gt; fill the numbers to 25
---
Seems to me one of the bigger barriers to pumping out regular fractals is what to do with the constraints of the 1-100 tier system. They'll either have to start making some exclusive to Tier 2+ or revamp a bunch of achievements/etc to accommodate an expanded fractal roster.
---
The new weapon skins look nice. Everything else ... meh?
---
I guess the issue here becomes kind of like:
---
*If my reward structure is based on a single income (gold), then if I need to adjust a reward, I need to consider the gold income from every single content that rewards gold
---
* If my reward is based on content, then if I need to adjust rewards I need to consider the content and the players who have gone through that content.
---
It puts a different strain in different ways on different people. Ideal world, both types of reward structures could exist (maybe not necessarily for all kinds of content; maybe some pieces of content will reward universal/more widely available currency, letting people play content their way) and some will be rewarding players for participating in certain pieces of content.
---
FFXIV does this decently well, in my opinion because in terms of gear progression pre-level cap gear is bought with tokens you earn for doing non-current content, while at-cap gear is earned by doing current content at a more controlled pace.
---
Meanwhile there's other pieces of content that have their own little rewards that are desirable, while at the same time the most fluid currency, actual in-game money still has their value for all pieces of gear/skins/items that are tradable.
---
It creates a decent balance I think, and sometimes I wish GW2 would try to move away from this almost-everything-is-gold mantra, but I don't think it is, not while gold-&gt;gem conversion is a thing and the gem store is their primary source of income.
---
&gt; Bjora Marches was the Map were Jora cleansed her bloodline in the Bear shrine
---
That's why I don't get the whole raven thing. The raven centric big shrine is on the other side of the Shiverpeaks, but bear is right here, why are we getting a raven master instead of bear?
---
i'd like one too, if you'd be so kind 😁
---
I did the same with Warbringer. Took me only one and half year but I did it ;) It's my pinnacle achievement  in GW2.
---
Somewhere along with raid, WvW alliance and other actual meaningful content. 
---
So wait for another year or so, meanwhile buy gems and join the friendliest community in the open world &lt;3
---
Everything you had a problem with can actually be done.
---
Well I can see most of the people in this community are just as dry and about as much fun as that game was, glad I never got into this sub.
---
Fast forward to “strikes are too hard, pugs don’t know the mechanics and keep failing. Can you make them just DPS fights instead?”
---
Would love a code :)
---
This is not the definition of a scientific study but the definition of the process of studying a topic, for example, maths.
---
Whatever that creature in the forest was I fucking love the design.
---
They hyped Almorra up so much last patch, she better be alive and kicking ass.
---
I dont think it will ever work that way. How I understand it so far is as follows. When you swap between trait templates the game unequips everything putting you back to a core status and then equips the new selection of trait lines and utility skills. Maybe they can make it so the game recognizes hey only this non-elite trait line is getting changed or its the same elite on both or only the traits getting swapped or w/e so utility cd doesnt get triggered. Im pessimistic about anet being able to do something like that. 
---
For now you are better off manually swapping a traitline/trait vs swapping to another build set up when you are in a hurry.
---
I can’t speak with certainty about what the OP has done, but it seems like the GW2 client/server is still responsible for the transmission of these messages. I speculate that they’d have a log of the message - it just can’t be displayed with the current client’s limitations.
---
Do you honestly think that this iteration of bosses will generally take more than 30m by a casual group?
---
I've had a long break from playing and was so confused seeing it after returning. What are the issues with it, why are people upset? Should I be too?
---
Sya, for example, is a token character.
---
Amount of effort. If I'm going to earn a 4 dye basic skin it should not take a legendary amount of effort to make.
---
I think you're missing the point. The point was vilifying the "dead game" meme and constant thread with any fuel for the fire.
---
Because their reused content was a response to people farming fractals and not for the purpose of providing new content. They made two trivial fractals, which had a low time requirement for completion, into two monster fractals that take forever or have mechanics no one practices (underwater combat).
---
The reality of the situation is that we’ll likely get a few more years out of GW2 before Anet announces some new project, maybe GW3, we won’t know till we get there so who knows. The problem is that GW2 itself is outdated at it’s core and Anet doesn’t have the same kinds of resources Blizzard has, they’re not going to overhaul the entire thing from the engine to the graphics, just to keep the game alive, at it’s end stages. 
---
I think the key thing to understand here, is when we say that the game is at the end of it’s lifespan, we don’t mean “it’s over this year, this is it.” What we mean is that it’s got anywhere from two, to upwards of 5 years left, depending on where Anet decides to go with what it already has.
---
Their environments always look fantastic. Hard to believe this is an over 7 year old game.
---
It should not take more than 30 minutes. The 10 minutes per boss enrage timer is ideal. The big amounts of time needed to finish it would kill it before arrival, the huge time needs for raids are one of the main issues why people don't do them - they don't have 2 hours to spare in random groups.
---
That being said, first time can take more with no problem, before people realize strategies.
---
Yes please! Thank you!
---
I just noticed there an Icebrood Shaman standing \*inside\* the Icebrood Construct. Now that's awesome.

[When I tried to raise the same concern](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dtjti0/anet_listens_acknowledges_and_discusses_but_in/) I was heavily downvoted. It looks like that even the community doesn't care that much or even think that talking about future plans is too soon.
---
You know what's happening? People not caring enough or either leaving.

If you are talking about reddit, it will be drowned in downvotes and all the “ OMG the new map is amazing love this community AAAAAHHHH&lt;3” posts.

&gt;Ctrl + F "Legendary - 0/0"
---
I mean we are getting a new upgradable weapon set, but I guess I'm the only one who really liked seeing the new legendary with each episode? It would have been time to start series 3, and any of them could have been next.
---
Back in October when I tried it and researched I saw threads talking about using an app or adding people to your steams   friendslist
---
Awesome, having an alternate chat with more option/better readability if for every language important ;)
---
Looks pretty cool. But so far, all of what's showcased has been fairly predictable developments, similar with the prologue. Let's hope there's something unpredicted.
---
Half expected to hear skillet in the background with that title.
---
"Easy raids" basically.
---
Constantly fucking up revenant skills on map change. At this point I accept that they truly don't care about much besides grabbing every penny they can, I just want the damn thing to work with one of their own classes.
---
I'd like one. Thanks!
---
What you expect? If they want to go through feedback and change stuff, it takes time. 
---
I would personally expect to get some bigger update for templates once PvP ones arrive.
---
Where are my damn dryders?!?!
---
Small problem, Skippy. Mantras have always reset when you change trait lines. This has nothing to do with build templates.
---
Of course it was. They are not going to do shit.
---
Too bad [Arena.net](https://Arena.net) negatively applies to players GW2, ignores their request, introduce Cyrillic in game, simply adding the fine print in Unicode game.
---
Destiny could use some pointers because their raids suck imo
---
We asked for an answer. We would be happy with a simple "no", like 7 years ago - here we are powerless, this is the right of the developer. But we are ignored when we make an appeal, when on a broadcast reading the question "why don't you answer the appeal of the Russian-speaking community?" Rubi Bayer (pretending) that she saw nothing.
---
A large company is not obliged to please everyone ...
---
The community turned to the company, Anet pretends that we do not exist.
---
GW2 is generally fucking terrible at explaining boss mechanics ingame though.
---
Most bosses have completely irrelevant descriptions like "Spawns grubs" or rely on reading the tooltips of their unique buffs, which isnt always possible to do before starting the boss and doing it while the boss oneshots you with mechanics you dont know yet is dumb.
---
I dont get why Anet ruins Fractals with this kind of bullshit when they have shown the ability to make good Fractals. The Nightmare Tower Fractal is amazing, but still fair for people that do it first time. Its not like its super trivial either, especially if you run CM.
---
Thats how Fractals should be.
---
*grins in reaper*
---
Short version: There was a mod addon for ArcDPS that handled build templates. It had basically infinite storage and was free. I've heard one or two mumbles about issues with it, but never had a problem when I used it.
---
Anet shut it down and shipped their own version, which converts the existing build slots for PvP and WvW into generic template slots that can be used any time. They marketed these as free slots(!) but people who played those modes already got nothing. Build templates (the setup of traits and skills your character uses) are stored in a text string that can be copied to and pasted from a Notepad file... Anet charges you money to do that, though. So you can pay for THEM to keep extra lines in a text file on the server.
---
On release, it was also so buggy that people regularly crashed out other players with bugged templates... So for a couple days ever meta event would end in a crash and rollback, costing the participants their loot.
---
It also interacts bizarrely with legendaries - trying to quick-swap weapons will spit out a blank, un-statted legendary and all the socketed items individually. Trying to swap gear templates in certain places can dump all of your equipped gear into your bags. Trying to buy templates in those same places can result in you being charged but not receiving the template slots. The method they use to hash build templates doesn't interact properly with revenant legends, so it will alter the position of the skills on your bar when you change maps and change build templates.
---
So far, Anet's response to these issues beyond the game-halting crashes is "we're listening to your feedback, guys! ^___^ " aaaand that's it. So people are afraid given Anet's track record of kicking features out the door and abandoning them that with the upcoming LWS episode coming out the problems with the new templates are going to remain and the free version is still nonfunctional, so we'll be stuck with the flaws.
---
Yes you can :) the Episodes can be bought with gems in the story journal or as a complete pack in the gemshop. But I don't think skill 5 is that important, because you should avoid getting into downstate.
---
I mean, Jormag did eat Owl, so the setup is all there.
---
Gw is cpu heavy go for desktop mobile processors too gimped to save power.
---
&gt;or that we couldn't use voice chat  with randos if we were in a fireteam.
---
 What? At least that you can do in game, it's even mandatory for raid training.
---
Nothing bigger, just something New. Bangar's whole issue is that the big threats (dragons, flame legion, humans) are mostly dealt with, but he doesn't know how to adapt to not fighting for survival, so he invents a new enemy just for the sake of having one. Jormag is pressuring us in that same direction. It offering us protection and power is what's important, the reason for that protection isn't.
---
Before it was, "where did you get that?!"
---
Now you don't even have to ask
---
The forest creature looks like a leshen
---
&gt; It's not though, because it is a core part of the operation of the game.
---
This is a optional activity to do. You opt into the systems of a video game by logging into it. Yes some of them suck or are disliked but thats the same for every video game out there. Nothing is perfect for every type of player that exists.
---
&gt; This is an action/adventure game. The only people who should be making gold off the TP's operation are people turning in items that they found in the world,...
---
If you want to treat the game like a action adventure game think of the TP like a npc vendor and insta sell everything just like you would do at a vendor.
---
It's a protection racket, clearly. Primordus is going to be voiced by Joe Pesci, and they're gonna be like, "It'd be a shame if something happened to your army, Commander. Capisce?"

The dragons have progenitors, who are previous Elder Dragons. Just like Aurene killed one dragon and took its place, it's likely that Kralk did so too, ages ago. And Balthazar wasn't even pretending to be trying to protect anyone from anything, he was out for revenge, pure and simple.
---
we're clearly having different experiences then, i've seen conversations along those lines twice.

You're thinking of A Bug In The System. Long Live The Lich trailer was Joko having fun.

Wasnt MO not doing much with GW2 at all and mostly did stuff with the hidden games anet was working, which NCSoft canned this year?
---
Is it possible to get mount skins from BL chests? I believe I got my glider skin from one (or maybe it was an achievement chest, can't really remember). On the post yesterday about mount skins I saw a lot of people saying that you're stuck with default unless you pay for gems. Obviously BL keys aren't exactly easier to come by, but I was just wondering if the gem store thing was strictly accurate.
---
if you can afford to buy gems, season 3 is currently discounted so it's the best time to buy it
---
Gear treadmill is boring son.
---
These weeks I've been creating many different cool builds with Gw2skills.net build editor, generating chat codes with it, copying them into different text files and then applied the codes to many characters. It is really nice and easy system.
---
Get Bolt the legendary sword of you want lightning aura.
---
Don't forget about the gold costs. I am willing to bet a lot of people convert gems to gold to buy/finish legendaries.
---
pls show me what those 250 people where working for this year ... clearly it couldn't be new gw2 content
---
Judging by the look, and the location, i'm 99% sure it's a Wendigo. Looks really cool
---
Yeah, it's the episode with Doric in it... I forget the name right now. Should be 200 gems, or like 75 gold? Ish?
---
&gt;Which makes me think that it's more of an... "obligation" issue, since officially adding these characters would imply that they now should be able to police reports written in unsupported languages
---
I'm not sure why people think that's a thing, I doubt Arena.net police something written in Esperanto or actual Latin even though they use the same characters.
---
My favorite items are ones I can earn in game...
---
Well, Carys [explicitly says](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/After_the_Storm) that they are not in that kind of relationship:
---
&gt; Player: You said you know Tegwen. Was she your partner?
---
&gt; Carys: Mentor, more like. She's very kind to me, and teaches me all sorts of things. We defend this beach together.
---
and
---
&gt; Player: Can you tell me more about Tegwen?
---
&gt; Carys: She's my best friend. When I woke from the Dream, the undead were attacking. Tegwen threw me a sword so I could defend the Grove.
---
Not at all, it is great because before that I used only one build per character, now I can finally have more then one. With stored builds I'm good for wvw or pvp, so I can be free from the chore of updating arcdps at every now and then. Feels really good. 
---
I can't understand all this criticism, maybe you should try a bit some cancer mmo and clear your thoughts
---
&gt;I would care, but the bottom line is that they want to sell mounts because that provides revenue. They are probably afraid that releasing free mounts will make them lose some of that revenue. What's there to argue about if this is indeed the case?
---
Everyone is free to talk about their dissatisfaction. As a player I am dissatisfied about the fact that there are no mount skins aside from vanilla ones obtainable ingame, so I will talk about it. If enough players talk about this, maybe there may be some change, but if not atleast it serves as venting.

Why would we upvote something that has been adequately answered and isn't interesting to discuss?

INB4; Logan looked better before!
---
put them on american servers, and inject Korean PvPers right into this PvP population. Desperately needs it.

This animation is not accessible to any player character. It's exclusive to Logan in some instances. Other ways to see that animation play out is by checking out older trailers, like this one:

---
I have one Episode of each already so the price was 800 for me
---
LS 3 and 4 have cost 960 gems since they came out with a 20% discount if you buy the whole pack, with a scaled down price if you already own any of the episodes. 
---
Either you saw them at 800, they were on sale.
---
&gt; Armor metallic appearance reduction: -8000%
---
That fault is on who ever took the picture of Logan. That armor on my computer's settings is just as, or even more, shiny than the alpha.
---
This original plot also had a lot to do with Utopia's plot, which was focused in the Mists and dealt with the Six Gods' families. In Utopia concept art, we see a lot of black-with-red-eye demonic armies, which is reminescent of the Shadow Army, carrying a red flag around (Menzies' banner), indicating that Menzies had a fairly sized role in the plot.
---
In that plot, I'd imagine it would be the Six who were protecting humanity / Tyria, while Dwayna's father (one of the examples of "the Six's families" mentioned) were anti-Tyria because of all the mess Menzies, Dhuum, and Abaddon has caused with demonic forces. Thus the Hero of Nightfall would be trapped between two forces - the overly righteous forces of the "Divine Father", and the sinister forces of the "Evil Brother".
---
I saw me a Vaettir, get ready to farm guys.
---
Forgotten don't come from Tyria. Like humanity, they come from beyond the Mists.
---
I still feel bad about Ajax. Hopefully she just gets captured, and eventually rescued and retires.
---
Not to the Korean market it isn’t. If a game doesn’t string you along there then they think it’s too easy.
---
Should there be a motivator to endlessly continue strikes when they're intended to be the stepping stone to raids? I hope they pump out a few of these then go back to raids.
---
actually looking good
---
Why am I being downvoted to oblivion for showing this?
---
Just because there was a playerbase doesn’t mean it was relatively large. I’d like to see some numbers if you have anything more than anecdotal evidence.
---
Wouldn't the Latancy be that high that it wouldn't make much sense to fight competitively?
---
&gt; Is it "sig-nit" or "sign-it"?
---
Sig-nit.
---
Can i please have one . thank you
---
You were comparing it to Final Fantasy's sub system, so I was simply listing everything that FFXIV gets with ever patch as a comparison.  The point of said subscriptions is that they give the resources to get all that.  As far as masteries go... thats more of a game design issue than anything else, all that has to be done is is simply not make masteries require old Living Story update.  I'm not sure why you would think it would have to pay-gate new masteries.  Though is this already an issue?  I'm not sure how the ancient magics mastery track works if you don't have the earlier materies, I always assumed you didn't need the older stuff for the new stuff to work.
---
And when I was talking about armor and weapon sets, I said several for a reason, I'm talking like 5-10 new sets for both weapons and armor.
---
ArenaNet said post-PoF that "the gods' story isn't over".
---
So at some point the gods will return. But I don't think it'll be during this season.
---
Things got a bit heated recently, so I think a lot of the regular posters gave it a bit of a wide berth for a while. It'll recover in a week or so.
---
Looks like undead Fiend from Witcher 3
---
There hasn't been equipment additions that I will have to upgrade?
---
YAAAAAAAS!!!
---
BIG DARK CREEPY FOREST! :D
---
Given this map is technically split in two (second half coming with next episode), I imagine Jaga Moraine may be part of the next episode. Then again, Drakkar comes with Episode 2, so maybe Jaga Moraine is split in half, and the next episode will get the other half + Drakkar Lake.
---
no more new legendary weapon?
---
&gt; the price was 800 for me
---
And the discount for LWS4 is 20%.
---
800 * .8 = 640
---
Why exactly are you complaining?
---
Funnily enough, in GW2: (Aurene's) Champion is another title for the (Pact) Commander, and Hero (of Nightfall) is the title for the GW1 PC.
---
For experienced raiders probably not.
---
Mostly 'bitching' that strikes are completely failing at what they're supposed to do according to ANet, but sure.
---
That's the standard discount for buying "the rest of the season". The current discounts are in addition to that 20% discount and they're calculated correctly.
---
Different person here... Anyway, thanks for the summary. Really glad I quit playing GW2 hours after that Oct 29th Update, those bugs would be too frustrating for me, seeing my main character in full Legendary getting destroyed by this system and I wouldn't want to lose any infusions (I saw That\_Shaman Tweet about him losing infusions). Sounds like the game is unplayable :( . . . really sad to hear.
---
i don't think it has that long left, you have to keep in mind that ncsoft own them and they are not that profitable anymore, especially when compared to ncsofts other companies. it is more likely that anet will be shut down or bought by another company and restructured, i don't see them surviving too long if they remain on their current course. the whole end stages thing is their fault, wow survived and continues to survive for over a decade, if they would have just committed to their game they could have had similar success. it's like they are keeping one toe in the water and hoping thats enough without actually putting too much effort into the game.
---
Kormir was the one who called the cops
---
I wish WVW had changed but it's still basically the same.
---
Looks great.
---
Nightmare is a great balanced boss Fractal that really does scale in difficulty from T1 to T4 to challenge motes splendidly.  I think the problem is that making Fractals difficult tends to rely on player understanding of innate mob characteristics.
---
Fair enough, though that doesn't mean it didn't develop later on given that's said in the first instance with Carys.
---
I guess this means I have to log in again to get the free living world story chapter
---
Finally a map where my primal warden outfit makes sense!!
---
Because I have one episode of each season and I have to pay for a discounted full season...? 
---
200x6=1200 with 47% off = 636 vs 200x5=1000 with 47% off = 530
---
What's the point of adding mounts to the game if you're just going to disable them, mounts are intended to cross difficult territory easier
---
Core classes are still viable but elite specs bring so much more to the table in terms of utility and DPS. I find them more fun than the base classes. You aren’t barred from paying content as a base class unless your focus is WvW which requires specific builds if you find a WvW guild. 
---
I highly suggest getting the expansions (both are packaged at 30 bucks). HotTs has the most active metas, PoF mounts are the best implementation I’ve seen of mounts in a game.
---
It's a hard one to balance specifically because what it is.  You press 3 to deal direct damage.  1 does condition damage and doesn't synergize, 2 Immobilizes, 4 is a brief stun, 5 is a blind field.  Changing skill 1 to favour direct damage would hurt the Pistol/Dagger moveset that's a more coherent condition damage build.  The other skills have various effects that make them situationally useful, except that every time you use one of them you're hurting your only source of real damage output by being able to use skill 3 less.  Other Thief weaponsets get around that by having stronger auto-attacks, so it's okay to run out of Initiative, but that doesn't apply to Pistol/Pistol because of the condition damage on it.
---
Now, explaining why the weapon set doesn't get improved doesn't really help you, I know that.  But there's eight other classes you can try, as well as several different weapon sets for Thief, including the newer Rifle with Deadeye (which does not depend on spamming one button to the exclusion of all others).  You could always try something else out!
---
For a split second after reading your comment I was absolutely sure I am in r/EvE subreddit. Different games, same chant.
---
Wasn't really meaning an oblong shape. I doubt they'll get ALL of the GW1 zones or stick strictly to them - Grothmar Valley's a good example, which expands a tad bit north of the original map (and notably, eastward too). Was more just meaning that we'll likely go further west with the second half of the map, and we could probably expect this map to expand beyond the Bjora Marches' boundaries of GW1 - whether it's just expanding west into Jaga Moraine, or also going south into Norrhart Domains or north into new lands is unknown - though if it covered the northern end of Jaga Moraine, I imagine they'd have showcased that endless pit.
---
Pve- or pvp-wise?
---
You can still start an LFG without the tag, even though your resulting squad will be capped at ten players, it still tells people that the map is there and you can clear people out of your personal group to invite more.
---
The Verdant Brink meta isn't one where you really want a commander tag to follow, anyway.  Players need to split up in small groups all across the map to do multiple things at once.  50 players following a single tag on that map is a guarantee that the map will fail.
---
My bad. Sorry.
---
Is there a plague doctor mask and I did not mean the stat combo I mean the large nosed mask
---
&gt;wow survived and continues to survive for over a decade, if they would have just committed to their game they could have had similar success.
---
Oof, somebody hasn’t been keeping up with what’s going on with Blizzard for the past year up to the current date but they’re hurting right now, real bad.
---
That said, WoW isn’t actually all that much older than GW2 **and** WoW has the added benefit of their massive which is generated through subscription fees, cash shop, merchendising, countless other titles they sell and have sold through the years besides WoW, books, etc. Blizzard has always been a real cash cow because they’re in the business of making money, not particularly **just** the MMO business. Given their immense budget, of course they’ve been able to afford **absolutley massive** overhauls to the game, multiple expansions, and even then they’ve had bad releases, content droughts, employee loss, restructuring.
---
Just ask yourself. If it can happen to a company like blizzard, what makes you think Anet isn’t prone to similar blunders?
---
&gt;i don't think it has that long left, you have to keep in mind that ncsoft own them and they are not that profitable anymore.
---
That’s simply not true, it’s hard to get the data for you as I’m on mobile and everything I find with current data is contained in a reddit post, but while the numbers aren’t astronomical or anything, the fact remains that GW2 is most definitely in the green, with recent upsurges.
---
On my computer is still shiny on high settings, but it doesn't look like metal, it looks like shiny ceramic or plastic.
---
Huh, the one around 0:30? Almost looks like an older verison of the "forehead rub" idle or w/e that is supposed to be. You're right then, might be from the beta?
---
I have not played in ages.....do I need to come back?
---
I think all you miss out on is some scrap... it's not a hugely discounted bundle.
---
\*purely speculation\*  
---
My guess would be something along the lines of the Counter Magic or Siren of Orr mastery skills.  Or it could be something similar to the Dragonfall spears/stones where you can collect an item with limited charges.  But you can only collect them if you have the mastery skill unlocked, similar to the Exalted Assistance skill.
---
My normal working day is 6 to 6, including a pretty brutal commute. I used to be able to commit to raids in the evening but as I've taken on more responsibilities I'm often too tired. This means doing a few select bosses at the weekend and despite previously enjoying full clears, I'm now happy with a couple of end bosses and the Call of the Mists wings. I'm quite okay with rotations because of this.
---
I find festivals a hassle but committing to raids and a static is definitely harder. Trains late? That's a missed raid. Have to work late because of issues outside my control? That's a missed raid. Have to work different hours? Missed raid.
---
That isn't a sort of variable schedule that is fair to put on a static in my opinion.
---
I highly doubt they would want to put their limited resources into making more legendaries.
---
Absolutely, I agree that small bug fixes should be addressed and I imagine they will be but any larger response is unlikely at this time.
---
That is not the enrage but the mechanic you are supposed to jump over it by going to one of the small hills.
---
I don't think you've really made a good case of that though. Care to expand? The issues you raise seem directly contradictory.
---
Thanks for making it simple to grasp :) I think I'll grab S4 for the 20% discount on the one chapter if possible.
---
Just a note arcdps was not infinite storage. Despite that the functionality is still better than the ingame build templates.
---
Wow genuinely surprised the game is still rolling. I'm not talking negatively of it I just got bored after making it to max level years ago. Nice to see they are keeping the game rolling. It was one of the best MMO's for exploring.
---
200 gems per episode. 6*200=1200 gems, it's correct. 
---
If you already unlocked one or more episode, the price will go down. Probably that's where your confusion is coming from.
---
You don't get any excitement from being able to do something special for a limited time on an annual rotation? If I could do the clocktower jumping puzzle all day every day I'd love to but it wouldn't be as special when october came around.
---
Which is fine, you'll be able to do them next week. Or another week. I have a very limited play schedule normally and I'd rather have something like this than getting burnt out on the same content daily, when I'm able to commit, like fractal CMs and the current strike.
---
I fully believe that rotating content is a good thing for a game.
---
Raids always being available is not the same as a Strike being available. For one, raids have a considerable barrier for entry in terms of group composition and required experience. Strikes don't have that imposition currently.
---
*(Translator's note: Keikaku means plan)*
---
Ep2 will be different, since it's supposed to reuse the same map.
---
That rings bells!
---
You. Aren't. The. Target. Audience. For. Strikes.
---
I'm a big story buff, so i'd say yes you would, but it's hard to argue that it's worth the money to pay for them, since you have access to the maps and features that came with these episodes already, for free.
---
If you're tight on spendable money for the game, probably not, especially if you don't have season 3 or 4 yet. Just look up a video guide and grab the story that way.
---
I'm on the "all auras should be infusions" boat. Though, that may be tough for weapon auras being placed on armors.
---
The end of the trailer was super creepy 🙀
---
They never were a replacement.
---
To build on the idea of overcoming challenges, to add atmosphere, to allow for development of masteries? There are a whole host of reasons. 
---
In case you've missed it, there are already areas in the game where mounts are disabled due to terrain and locale.
---
Mounts are nice and I think they are great but there are also times where not having access to them makes an experience richer.
---
The entire story is chronological events in HoT are directly affected by events in the previous stories
---
I love the "We're looking at your complaints" response, followed by complete silence on the matter.
---
It's almost as if they want this problem to go away.
---
The Prolouge been keeping people busy, the maps are still full of people doing the meta events. People were saying the concert would be fun two times and yet every time we have tons of people doing them. I think Arena Net did a good job with the Prouloge map and i hope the chapter will keep up with that as well.
---
2 weeks is not long, not even close. From my development profession I can tell you that sometimes even minor changes have to go through a lot of checkpoints before they get released
---
Their priorities are fixing major bugs, the new episode, and probably discuss internally of what can be done regarding build templates, get approved/disapproved, rediscuss if necessary, bla Bla Bla, develop the necessary changes, etc. It's not as simple as people think. 2 weeks is barely enough for them to discuss possible changes given the priorities at hand. I'm not trying to White Knight anet  but people need to understand that it's not as simple as it seems. I wouldn't expect anything in the next 2 weeks either besides bug fixing
---
Depends. Do you want to have one big hole in plot (season 1) or two big holes in plot (season 1 and 2)? You decide!
---
So unfortunately we can't play season 1 of the living story anymore, so you're already going to be missing some information.
---
In general though, yes, the seasons are chronological, they go personal story-&gt;season 1-&gt;season 2-&gt;HoT-&gt;season 3-&gt;PoF-&gt;season 4-&gt;season 5
---
So by missing out on season 2, you might be confused going into HoT
---
That being said, season 2 isn't all that interesting, nor does it really bring much new to the game. Seasons 3, 4, and 5 all have new maps and masteries, but season 2 does not. So if you're not super invested in the story, you could probably wait to get season 2, but if you hate going out of order, then I would play it
---
As an addendum to my previous comment, you can absolutely play these episodes with a friend if you wish, so if you've got someone who has them and would be willing to take you, go that route
---
One for me, please.
---
...just like legendary armour baby...
---
Or perhaps a Leshy? Humanoid Forest spirit with antlers?
---
I'd believe they are, I think there were statements during the Icebrood announcement that it's still WIP
---
For season 3 lets assume it’s that way:
---
So 
---
1000*0.8=800
---
With the +33% off now
---
800*0.67=536 so the price is wrong this way, but strangely if we make 
---
1200*0.47=564 that is much more closer to the value in store for me now... 
---
Same with season 4 price
---
With +27% off
---
800*0.73=584 also very different from
---
The price I have of  640, but again if we make 
---
1200*0.53=636, again much more closer to the value in store...
---
Would be really nice!
---
Supporting the LGBT community and Gay Pride is just a mainstream thing to celebrate. The popularity of it today is akin to the popularity of tobacco in the 1970's to 80's.
---
It's easy if you bring reflects or projectile block such as ventari, CPC, or WoR.
---
You are awesome man! Would be thrilled if theres still a code left for me!
---
I would just play through HoT and wait for season 2 to go on sale. You miss so much from season 1 anyway that season 2 is just a bit confusing. If you want story than read through the wiki entry for season 1 than play or read 2.
---
https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/81d40Upgradeable-Ancient-Boreal.jpg
---
Idk, kinda looks like a polished material to me. Granted, could still be wooden. Also, could be both!
---
Also, from their site "Restore this tarnished and timeworn armory to its former glory". Tarnished is a term for metal, I believe.
---
Almost as if we do just exist, and are perceived as people passing by or going about their business, out there in the real world.
---
And while we might not tell this aspect of our lives to everyone (the Commander is weirdly chatty after all...), there are moments when people will be able to see that we are visibly LGBT+, be that hand holding with our partner, a slipped comment or appearing as visibly trans.
---
It's definitely nice to see similar in games where, unsurprisingly, the information will be conveyed to us though dialogue or text.
---
Each episode cost 200 gem
---
6 episode = 1200 gem (6*200)
---
the complete pack gives u 20% off. (1200*.8) = 960
---
now 20% on top of your 960 gems (960*.8=768)
---
you got 1 out of 6 episodes unlocked. only got 5 episodes left to unlock:
---
768/6*5= 640. Maybe learn how to math before complaint? lol
---
As an engineer main, I appreciate that a lot of the flavor text is different for you when you interact with technology around the game. For example, the hear at the Pact encampment in Jahai. If you're an engineer, you can fix the DERVS without having to ask a nearby engineer what's wrong with them.
---
To be honest, "we're working on it" has been for long the polite way of Anet to say "we have no idea what to do with this"...
---
\*shines like a shiny beacon\*
---
&gt; With the +33% off now
---
You made that up. There is no 33% off. 
---
&gt; With +27% off
---
You also made that up. There is no 27% off.
---
* LWS4 = 20% discount
---
* LWS3 = 30% discount
---
* LWS2 = 40% discount
---
any class is fine, you just need to learn how to play the game
---
Ok gotcha.  I couldn't remember if the keys were discounted at all with past bundles.  I mean, I hope so for others, but for me, bleh.
---
I am aware. I was one of the people prominently providing feedback both on reddit, on the forums and on Twitter. You can check my post history here for a concern I raised regarding the QoL decrease for legendary gear relative to ascended with the current template implementation. 
---
I would imagine that actually releasing templates took up most of the time prior to release. I'd still not expect any major changes this quickly.
---
Well, ANet has done it once again!
---
Wow! This was breathtaking to say the very least. What an A M A Z I N G trailer.
---
The sheer tension of this gave me goosebumps. The undead moose thing left me a bit scared! 
---
Not to mention all the new features! 3 strike missions bosses on a weekly rotation? Awesome. A new upgradeable weapon set? Better than any legendary. A whole new map, finely crafted with intricate detail for us all to explore? This is why I play GW2.
---
They have really outdone themselves this time.
---
All the doomsayers can finally shut up now! GW2 and ANet are going stronger than ever!
---
and the appropriate definition to apply in this case, since he did not bring up science, you did.
---
In my country 30$ is 10% of median wage.
---
Hey if vaettirs are there chances are Jaga Moraine will be there 😅😅
---
It's a dude
---
You nailed the lightning, color palet and maybe texture too i'm not a pro , gg   
---
And you also nailed Picasso face art :D   
---
Joke aside that's nice, but the face looks weird indeed.
---
I have my doubts we'll see anymore.
---
Check the screenshot... I’m looking at the in game gem store and it says: 53% off season 3 and 47% off season 4...
---
&gt; Do people run the Verdant Brink meta anymore? I was hoping to grab a set of Bladed Armor for the stat-selection, but I never see any postings in LFG. I still see Tarir, Dragon's Stand, and even occasionally Chak Gerent groups, so I'm not sure what's up.
---
Yup. Keep an eye on the event timer at the wiki and just turn up at the right time. More often than not you'll find people. 
---
&gt; If I want to complete one or two of the HoT Chapter metas to get one of the free ascended Marauder-stat amulets, which are the easiest/most straightforward to do? Or are they all bothersome and it'd be better to just throw that on the LS3 farm pile?
---
They're all in the "fun challenge" level of difficulty. Act 3 is pretty easy.
---
&gt; I just wish it didn't start with "Commander". I'm so sick of hearing it.
---
This is a popular trend right now. Lot of people in the genre are a bit sick of getting their egos stroked and don't want to be treated like saviors anymore. 
---
People just want to be adventurers again, it's one of the main pulls for classic WoW. We are supposed to get immersed and lost in the world of an MMO, not have the whole universe revolve around us.
---
Took them 7 years to finish the second set to legendary weapons.  We won't see the start of the third set for a long while.
---
Vaettirs were in more places than Jaga Moraine. ;)
---
I hope ANet won't threaten you to cease and desist development, while implementing their own, inferior, paid alternative. Like they've already done once.
---
There are no official way of converting gems to cash afaik so I don’t see how this would apply
---
Are raids really that small? I see so many guilds advertising for it.
---
Well shit. I should be stacking these so when I need one particular currency I can open them then.
---
actual fixes and delivering them is another topic. this is about simple communication. it's been 6 or so weeks since the announcement and virtually all complains since then have only been proven valid. it's also been 2 weeks since the actual patch, and apart from a handful of bugfixes and a "we acknowledge your feedback".
---
fixing is one thing, communicating a little before they can attempt to hide behind the next "hype" wave is another. complains aside the system has some serious issues that make it virtually unusable in certain cenarios or entire classes ffs, and i don'tean simple bugs but goddamn design errors, and that is more and more defining for ANet's overall image and reputation.
---
Nothing in and past PoF is entertaining though. Gerent and T4 in VB might be considered more entertaining and guess what, people still do them. They even do the Triple Wurm.
---
&gt;ELI5
---
US government be greedy.
---
Side note - Good luck on enforcement.  No way to get accurate data when you can sign up for a GW2 account with false info.  The only way for the government to tax game virtual currencies is to pass a law requiring companies to verify identities of players, and their Tax ID/SSN to open accounts.  Then game companies would need to sort all US players, and submit reports to the IRS.  So opening a game account will be akin to opening a bank account.  That will never happen.
---
As a Reaper main, I'd say Reaper.
---
Those are not the words I'd use, but it's still around.
---
And here people were saying how GW2 wouldn't continue like before. Hah!
---
I think it's safe to say that with the addition of all these amazing new features, not even speaking of the new map features, GW2 is back in action once more.
---
And to all of you complaining about the lack of fractals, dungeons and raids: so? That was never the point of playing GW2 in any way.
---
The whole idea of GW2 is a living world. Open world content is what makes GW2, well, GW2. It's a good thing if they finally scrapped all that instanced crap a very small minority of people played.
---
And before you start yelping again: that content is still there, so go play it. GW2 doesn't need anything but new open world additons like the content featured in Whispers in the Dark.
---
The story, graphics and setting is what matters most. After all, nobody started playing GW2 because they wanted to raid. In fact, GW2 is the MMO you want to play  if you really don't like MMOs. Keep that in mind.
---
If you have HoT the exotic armor is sold by the merchant next to the first waypoint. You can get the last piece of it by participating in a tier 4 meta from that map.
---
That's honestly an insane detail. I just can't belive that someone actually thought of adding such a small dialogue change for one specific class!
---
Easy and grind are not the same things. Dota is one of the most complex games and literally no one in Korea play it.
---
I think the pacing in 4 was all over the place as it either felt like everything was happening at once or you were just sort of pootling around the desert. 
---
Episode 6 gave up too much too quickly. "Oh look, she's better now" could have been so much more. The actual map itself is amazing but the storytelling in it was very uneven.
---
Would like a code but I guess I am very late. :\~)
---
Yes, I guess math in NA have different rules... Or tell me where is the mistake in what I said
---
Is reusing the same map supposed to be better than a new map in some way? Or do you just mean that is the major difference between the living world and a saga?
---
Zergs are necessary if you don't PvP much or at all.
---
And the new mastery can help with that, you struggle at first and after you get Raven help you don't need to worry about it too much.
---
When the lore team gives more attention to a profession than balance team...
---
i mean, it's still a discount
---
Standard metroidvania fare. New area, New locks, new keys. Lather, rinse, repeat. Old keys may see some use too
---
I'm either gonna be disappointed when I visit dry top or I'm gonna want to visit constantly.
---
But they were in an interview few weeks after
---
He's also a human being, like the rest of us. He deserves to be some semblance of alive , at least
---
Another GW2 and Secret World player?  Sweet. You play the OG or Secret World Legends?
---
This seems to be more targeted at trying to tax cryptocurrency income, or any digital currency that can be traded back into real money.  You can easily use bitcoins to "launder" your money and avoid paying your taxes.
---
Not sure if you can do the same with gems.  They cannot be traded back out for real money (except in the case of gold sellers, which is explicitly forbidden by Anet).  And I seriously doubt that you are trading in all of your income for gems to avoid claiming the income on your tax returns.  And if you are, then God help you.
---
Jobo/Hobo/Heal-o/Bait-o - Tron
---
FIFY
---
New map with more CRYSTALS, but this time they're WHITE!
---
Not contesting that... but at least put the values right or explain how the “discount” is applied...
---
Id love to have one code for my account if you have any left! Thank you very much :)
---
I mean Anet isnt profitable enough for NCsoft to care about, so if they drop below 10mil usd quarterly revenue it might be the end for Anet because I dont see NCSoft give more funds when no expac is incoming (which proved twice to skyrocket the quartely sales) and senior devs keep bailing at faster rate then we get good new names to replace them.
---
I mean honestly it's not boring to me in the slightest. Doing things like material conversions for gold is no more boring than doing Silverwaste farming.
---
What it's really done for me is make a lot more of the game fun for me since it feels like all of the game is rewarding now. All the things that seemed useless before like XP boosters now can be directly translated into things I can make gold from or use to make shinies for myself.
---
Not sure if serious...
---
And their numbers play what role again?
---
What was there to be swept under the rug?   
---
People complained, ANet looked at the feedback, ANet looked at the sales, ANet decided to ignore most of the hyperbolic outrage. And rightfully so!
---
This game is B2P for a reason. They have to sustain themselves somehow or do you believe the devs are working for free? How naive.
---
No, nothing was swept under the rug, Mr Jones. It's just that they didn't give in to outrage culture this time!
---
Easier said than done.
---
TIL someone in the GW2 community still doesn't know how Octovine works.
---
Oh, the coat is from just any one of the night bosses? Somehow I thought it was just from the big wyvern on the aerial platform.
---
Anyhow, thanks for the info. I do want to run one of my Sylvari through the HoT story, so that should help me snag anything Sylvari-specific (as well as seeing any bonus narrative).
---
Just do it! Make your dreams come true!
---
Haha, while I do like a fun challenge, I'm coming back after some time away, so my general rustiness might end up getting me killed a fair few times. Looking over Act 3, it seems reasonably straightforward.
---
And I already explained that. That's marketing nonsense based on if you'd bought all episodes at 200 gems each *including the ones you got for free*.
---
(I'm assuming you are not from this group which is why you're saying this.) You misunderstand, and herein lies the whole problem. If you were told that what defines you does not exist, does not matter, and should not be talked about, wouldn't that make you feel alien? Feel stepped on? Less than? Would you not want to be included in the world?  
---
  
---
People are not looking to be the center of attention, validated, or anything else like that. People are simply asking to be treated as *equal*. As *human* *beings*. To not be shoved under the rug while everyone else gets to go outside and play.
---
I thought this was a parody post for a moment........
---
Map looks great
---
The coat can drop from any of the night bosses.  However, getting Verdant Brink to the maximum Tier 4 in the night meta gives you a chest that lets you pick any Bladed Armour piece, including a coat, so that guarantee is better than the small chance a night boss might do it.
---
Everyone just camps out characters to fight the Matriarch because she's quick to beat and gives the Amalgamated Gemstone.
---
I agree but the IRS guidelines is vague and does not say that
---
&gt;open locks
---
*cries in thief*
---
Nope. It has to be convertible back to real $.
---
Entire guilds have tried and given up on on the dead slots.
---
So it wouldn't be New Major dlc like PoF and HoT? Oh well.
---
Where does it say that
---
I have a fairly glassy build on my dh that I do teq on.  I can camp out at 1200 range for the first burn and outdps most of the zerg while putting out only 2.5k dps.
---
Pugs do shit dps.
---
Essence manipulation sounds a lot like that supposed leak from a while back (manipulating skills with different dragon essences).
---
The answer is most likely no.  As it does not have a fair market value to where there is a commonly accepted price to exchange it from any willing buyer to another.  Therefore fails the value test.
---
I can't imagine the enforcement and audit issues if it was considered a virtual currency.
---
Molten boss?
---
Farming that one was mainstream.
---
Looks like reused assets. If you look closely at the other images of the new map, you'll see that the "snow corruption" you can see is actually a reskined brand.
---
Bangar at it again
---
I mean by this logic Steam trading cards are too. And actually Steam game keys could be argued as such too? And literally any item that's digitally purchased and transferable. I dunno, Amazon gift cards?
---
Maybe I'm reading too far, we should get someone with tax expertise actually in here, but it definitely seems like if Gems are read as one, we've not only made some wrong turns, but opened a big can of worms.
---
i mean just so i can have all the builds in discord chat and just switch how i need to like 
---
DD - Raids WvW PvE PvP as long a the copy paste allows
---
I don't know what happened to the game since PoF released, but every single update since makes me less and less interested in playing.
---
These masteries are just busy work, they're now starting to overlap with other masteries that are already in the game. Actually, busy work defines pretty much all of the 'content' that they've added to the game since PoF.
---
I'm actually looking forward to 360 days without fractals, I revel in the uproars when Anet fails to appease the players.
---
"a while"
---
308 days. It'll be a year by the time the next possible fractal release arrives (2 months from now at the absolute most optimistic).
---
The IRS does, which it's definition is fair market value.  Otherwise any Willy nilly can slap on any value they can find reason in
---
I think thats a jaded view on things. I think they took the feedback and are now figuring out how to address/handle the situation. They wouldn't have asked for feedback if nothing was going to be done about it. Just saying
---
If you get anymore for another wave of giveaways, I'd appreciate getting a couple for me and friend. Thanks for offering!
---
It's getting swept under the rug, obviously.
---
I don't know a single player who would describe siren's reef as "super fun" lol
---
Mordremoth seemed to prefer a very heavy handed approach to mental domination... Where the goal was to create so much noise in the heads of Sylvari that it drowned out their own thoughts.  Or at least that's what I gathered from dialog that spoke of it.  
---
Jormag's whispers are not necessarily the same thing.  They don't need to be implanted directly into the subject's head and what we have heard makes it sound as though it isn't trying to override or masquerade as the subject's own thoughts.  The physical corruption can come later, as with the Sons of Svanir, but it doesn't even need happen at all if the whispering convinces someone to follow.  
---
Inflicting fear, pain or outright domination as with Mordremoth will build resentment and anyone who gets out from under it will be better equipped to resist later.  It's also easier to point at and say, "That's evil!"  
---
Manipulation like Jormag seems to do doesn't even require corruption if it finds the right individuals, look at the Sons of Svanir who have not been made into Icebrood.  It will also breed followers who have no issue with brutality against outsiders, and who will not seek escape the way Sylvari might have with Mord.  The ones who heed these whispers have the potential to be more scary than anything we have yet seen.
---
With that said, I do hope to have Sylvari make some mention of it either way because of how big a story point it was before.  But either way, I hope they really hammer on the mind games and insanity angle this time around... We need more than just another Sandswept Isles to build the momentum. (That episode hade an pretty epic too but really didn't deliver on it IMO)
---
I choked omg
---
Never underestimate a government's ability to be stupid or to waste money. It would not be surprising if one spent more money to enforce something like this than the amount they could collect.
---
IRS is vague on purpose, but it's very written to encapsulate a lot - so that anything that holds real monetary value counts. As gems only hold virtual value - AND - can't be converted, it's not a virtual currency.
---
&gt;The bulk of the game's content is open world PvE, all of which is infinitely repeatable. The LW and expac maps are especially popular given the dedicated meta events they have. Also world bosses.
---
I mean that is kiinda incorrect. Only a few meta's after LWS3 started are actually run, I wouldnt call that infinite repeatability when 95% of the playerbase does the meta's of new maps for 1-2weeks and then they die off rapidly to the point people make communities to run and find people a week ahead of time.
---
I can run through the entire PoF expac maps and run into 5-10 different people on each map because there's 0 reason to go to them after the PoF storyline. I found this out the fun way by tryingg to get an item from desolation meta, took me a full week of daily checking the LFG for a squad, that had more than 4people including me, for 2-3hrs/day AFTER they reworked the meta to be more profitable.
---
The only Meta events that are popular are the HoT ones and the ones that are close to the same g/hr as SW, just look at istan as soon as the profit decreased so did the population. Hell even the LW maps are basically all dead because there is 0 reason to go back to them unless you need trinkets (why BFF is the most populated LW map still to this day).
---
OpenWorld content is limitted repeatable.
---
so while we're freezing our dicks off what's primordus up to? or is he not awake?
---
I just accepted it and stopped playing for the moment ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
It doesn't say "can't be converted" in the guidelines. As the current definition stands I think USD bought game currencies fit the definition.
---
Most players are super casual and just doing worldbosses.  Even on GW2efficiency are just 20% having 13 LI or more. Third party sites as reddit and GW2efficiency are mostly used by more invested gamers. So its safe to asume that these numbers are in reality by far lower. Average open world casual is not registered on that side, these players are a big part of GW2 playerbase.
---
Guilds might be more invested into raids than the average population. What else is there to do for a group of players?
---
You don't need a guild to do vistas and hearts. So its fractals, dungeons, raids, guildmissions. Well - and "WVW raids".
---
Or under a Quiznos...
---
If these give the same things that the stuff behind the beetle "gates" give then you can ignore them as well. There is nothing interesting about them beyond maybe the first encounter.
---
Ok.
---
But I can sell the gems for gold in-game and then sell the gold for an amazon gift card on certain websites. So, it is convertible back, technically and the fair value does fluctuate.
---
Under the table as a quiznos on a different continent
---
Major difference.
---
I find it good though, since allows for more time being put into a single map. It will also be about the players forgetting the previous map with each release.
---
We'll see what they'll do in ep2, though.
---
&gt;Never underestimate a government's ability to be stupid or to waste money. 
---
You mean like sending a $20 certified letter in the mail to collect $4 that's past due?
---
It definitely does. Makes me think of a forest out of Diablo rather than Guild Wars. It's neat.
---
Mobs give more xp the longer they've been alive, so you can level really efficiently by doing laps around maps killing only neutral creatures that everyone else ignores.
---
Yeah, really.  That freaked me the fuck out in the theater.  Cool movie.
---
op just clickbaiting or just wildly ignorant of what they're talking about
---
their own comment in the other thread [states that you can trade the gems for $$](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/dvdrr9/the_2019_1040_asks_if_you_have_received_virtual/f7cddbw/). Not only did OP not actually respond correctly to the question put forth, but they went even further to suggest that RMT is under this umbrella as well.
---
No, you cannot trade Gems back to $$. No, you cannot sell items from the game for $$. Those are strictly against the terms of service and are grounds to terminate your access to the service.
---
I don't know what you were hoping to accomplish with this post. If you want to learn more about the virtual currencies requirements, visit the [IRS' website](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/virtual-currencies). It does not appear to have any affect on owning a "wallet" with a virtual currency as much as the sale of the currency to begin with.
---
I want the Braham armor too but it's not in the Gemstore for some reason... is it supposed to be available today, or closer to the episode release?
---
uhm but ur math is wrong, Anet did 70mil/year WITH 400! employees.
---
The layoffs happened in jan/febr of this year, so those people will prolly be payed out for 3-6months afterwards and at current revenue anet will barely mannage to make 60mil revenue this year. They're in a downward spiral each quarter which is normal for MMO's, but no expac release does mean no jump in sales/revenue like all the other MMO's had and Anet had with PoF and HoT. Q2 2019 was 12.8mil euro, which was a 4mil decrease to Q1 2019. With the giant content drought and unhappiness from players I dont imagine Q3 to be above Q2, especially cause WoW classic came out, D2 expac, FF14 expac all took plenty of players from gw2 in the end and with current outrage with greediness of anet I fear how q4 will run.
---
But if Anet manages to pull 60mil yearly revenue in 2019, with 260employees is 230.7k per person, Now if U include the 140people that got fired and give them a 3month wage that goes down to 214.3k per person. I mean it's still better than having 70mil yearly revenue prior with 400employyes, which means they had below 200k per person.
---
Also profit does matter for big companies, NCSoft is liable for Anet if they fuck up. Why would they risk getting in trouble for a company that is one of their lowest earnings after paying all wages and expenses? And this point is getting near because Anet WAS deleting information about their players when they asked for their EULA information, which is in violation of the European law and can give a fine of up to 5mil euro.
---
But we'll see how things will go after 2020 q1 revenue gets released, because I assume Q2 will always be lower because no holidays and such to boost sales.
---
Buckler is quite small.
---
And I can argue GW2 was designed as a PvP game with PvP-centric mechanics which then twisted into an open world game due to their mismanagement of competitive game modes. 
---
But really, GW2 is an MMO that offers a variety of experiences and was marketed that way. They've chosen a path moving forward but that was never entirely clear nor a good way to characterize the rest of GW2's content.
---
Not really, If say you put in a new reward and it turns out its too expensive to get or too cheap, you dont change all your gold rewards, you simple change the reward's price. Becides in most cases you have intermediate components since in most cases you're not buying the reward directly but rather components that get you there.  That has the additional benefit of letting you tweak the economy. One material is selling for too much gold, make it more available. One mateiral is loosing all its value, make it required in large numbers for your next reward etc..
---
That I agree. At the end of the day I am not saying my way is the right way to go, people like different things and there will always be people who just want specific rewards from specific contents, its what they enjoy and I am certainly not going to tell them there is a better way if that is what they enjoy. I am only arguing this is a viable model and it has its advantages nothing else.
---
well pretty much all games are goign to have a mix, gw2 has a mix too, plenty of rewards require playing specific content to be earned be it some drop from a specific event for a legendary collection or living world maps having their own specific currency. Its more about on which end of the spectrum they fall and gw2 always tried to maintain the matra of playing what you want to play rather then what the devs want you to play. They try to stay on that spectrum as much as possible. I dont think the gem store is really the primary motivator here.
---
I'm loving the darker, almost Burtonesque feel of that map. I have waited a long time for GW2 so be a bit more adult in direction. This looks promising.
---
I'm sorry what xD, where did you get that assumption that I'm a baron? I have never played the marketplace in my life, outside of maybe flipping copper ingots into iron ingots during the attack on LA for like an hour or two, i really don't have the patience for investments, nor the brain for flipping stocks on the market, and I just utterly hate having to sit and stare at a website/tp than actually play the game.   
---
90% of my gold has been earned by doing various farms/grinds such as selling map completions/legendaries (at over 70 map completions at this point) , raid selling, daily activities with 1-5 accounts (daily achis, asc crafting, home instance, fotm usually with only 1 acc AND MOST IMPORTANTLY full gemstone meta runs), weekly raids with 1-3 accounts (depending on spare time).  + festival farms/flavor of the month farms (like sw/riba/dragonfall/istan). Main thing that you have to know about making money as a actual player is how you spend your currencies you get from all the activities you do (spiritshards, volatile/unbound magic and so on.), when should you refine materials for better gains, how to deal with the loot you get (when and what to salvage or sell, and with which kits).
---
Thank you so much\~ sounds like we're in the same boat!
---
&gt;They are fucking liable for any and all losses caused by their flawed system
---
Source?
---
So are these boring ass strike missions the expansion level content being released? Weak.
---
It only blocks direct damage. Physical damage. Conditions are unaffected entirely, and attacks can still inflict new ones on you. You can still be stunned and knocked around too!
---
Hmm that is helpful! I will play around with some board settings as well to see about the first two options. This will... take a while to get results.
---
Way to generalize. Tell me. Do you think people who make snap judgements about people they don't know deserve respect?
---
First of all, what makes you think that content doesn't engage them. Maybe they're engaged by different things than you.  
---
Secondly, maybe people just don't enjoy the content you enjoy. Some people play pro ball to be competitive. Some people just like playing catch. 
---
I'm not sure why anyone should care about your judgement in the first place, but man, you're totally clueless.
---
I've spent a lifetime working in the most competitive fields. I don't need a game to prove to me I'm good or give me some sense of identity. But I like the game and I like my guild and I'm having fun.
---
Shrugs. Guys like you give guys that like the content you like a bad name.
---
3 new mounts in 2019? we got roller beetle in summer of 2018 and skyscale in may 2019, that's the only mount we got this year.
---
The accessories were literally the exact same as the first one, and the morphs were made with the first legendary trinket. (people had the effect with first trinket cause bug could cause it).
---
The weapons are literally no effort other than some modelling work, there is no achievement, it's pure mindless crafting. I'd say making gen 2.1 is less than half the work for devs than gen 1/2.0 was.
---
the strike mission is literally a story boss but more HP.
---
I mean making a race is barely any work, People made WAY better races with taco and in guild halls in less than a week of their in game time. Saying we got 5races this year is kinda sad..
---
What are those 15story line missions? we got ep5, ep6 and prologue so far. All together it's 6-7hrs of pure story which isn't that much.
---
The new zones are just big, filled with lots of emptiness and giant filler. I'd dare to say more effort was put into HoT era and LWs3 maps.
---
You do remember we used to get a Jumping puzzle with every episode in season 3? People were incredible sad they stopped doing them, so saying we got 1 on a full year compared to the 1 we got every 3months is a big OOF.
---
ascended cooking was a failure, it was rushed and badly planned. 
---
out of the 250 achievements, 150-180 were literally unlocked by doinng the content. Just slapping an achievement on it is no work at all. OMG YOU DID THIS STORY STEP? HERE GET THIS CHIEVO. and you get like 10 of those each episode :)
---
we didnt get legendary sigils, just runes. And like ascended cooking it was rushed and on top of that incredible overpriced. idk why anet thought with current marketprices 400g/rune would be worth it. Should've been 60-100g/rune.
---
Howmany of those maps were added to ranked PvP? You know the gamemode that's been complained about for years now where people want change? These maps don't even get added to ranked, they're just released and ignored.
---
The raid was THE. SINGLE. MOST. DISSAPOINTED. WING. EVER. They ignored player feedback and made every single boss so you couuld ignore the mechanics and just brute force your dps. On top of being so braindead easy even pugs had a full clear after 5-6hrs and CM's didnt really show anything new, hell pQadim you wouldnt even know it was CM. Of the 3 mechanics added, two is 100% useless and unnoticable and the third is ok, but still way to forgiviing.
---
The armor and weapon sets are nice, it's something they did good. Kinda a bit of boring grind, but it's an MMO so grinds are to be expected and needed.
---
The fix to unid gear to areas before PoF was good, but again rushed. They should've sit together for 10mins, asked players and realize to not make them auto salvagable.
---
For 250people it is kinda low. Especially compared to FF14 which also has a dev team of 260-280people, with the 5.1 patch we got more content in FF14 than half a year gives us in GW2. On top of them actively improving their older content to make it more enjoyable for newer players.
---
Anet is known for their incredible bad workflow, you can't really deny it. This was literally the reason why they had the layoffs, the fucked up all the sideprojects and didnt bother to do shit about it and just kept working on them till NCSoft said, yh no ur working on failed projects so I gotta come fix ur shit.
---
Not to mention that when you throw in lag and everyone crowding around the boss, it's impossible to see anything telegraphed beforehand. I usually get hit by stuff that I can't see until after I'm already on the ground.
---
A jaded view based on 7 years of this sort of communication... it's not unprecedented for Anet to ignore major game mechanics and complaints for years by sweeping it under the rug.
---
I read this all the time, and honestly I don't remember anything but contempt for that story when it was coming out. The production values were in the gutter, we had very little understanding of who all these new characters were and the writing was borderline pantomine.
---
Don't get me wrong it tied up well and the gameplay was fun, but the story presentation was an absolute mess 😩
---
Did he eat capital-O Owl? Or did he just eat "an" owl?
---
Raids are absolutely inclusive if you want them to be. If you can’t find a community as inclusive as you want then create your own group just like I did.  I created mine specifically to be more casual and more accepting than some of the elitist groups. Raids aren’t inclusive or exclusive by default; the level of inclusivity is directly related to the humans involved.  There’s a ton of people that seem to think raids are toxic and won’t raid because of it, but it’s absolutely viable for them to (As mentioned) create their own groups and  find likeminded people. But it’s easier, more rewarding, and more validating for these types of people to just complain about it endlessly instead of doing something to fix their dilemma
---
Not just pof; it lags in hot maps as well. 
---
I've only experienced these lag spikes in wvw but at this point it should be considered a feature in that mode lol naw but seriously fix the lags anet
---
WVW never changes....
---
I do think that when two masteries do basically the same thing, *either* should work.
---
Buy one letter for 100 gems, buy a batch of 5 for 400 gems and buy all 33 letters for the amazing discount of 2600 gems! You read that right, you get 7 letters FOR FREE!
---
Haha man you are a master troll :P
---
Of course it counts as an exploit, it allows Russians to communicate together, the horror! And we all know what happens after...
---
/s
---
Thanks for the video! Love the reactions in it haha.
---
Put dat darn Charr back to the Citadel!!
---
I'm glad this thread worked out. It's been a long time since a thread on this sub had my attention and oddly enough, last time was another thread about destiny 2. And whether we wanted it not, we stepped into a war with the cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command one by one.
---
I always liked it more when maps changed. As unpopular as LWS1 was for many, it was the best season for me. Bring back the marionette!
---
I always find angry rants so strange, I mean sure you can get frustrated, especially if someone is making it their mission to make your life hell. But to PM someone and start ranting instead of realizing that you just suck and have to improve yourself. Well at least it can be funny sometimes :P
