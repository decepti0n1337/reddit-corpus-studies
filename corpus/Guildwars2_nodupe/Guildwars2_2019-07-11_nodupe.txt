Even better, making him banned. Insta-blocked for the whole server. Maybe infinitely if permaban.
---
---
---
Ploint could probably help with that if he can ever get over wanting to raise home security raptors.
---
Or we can believe in the stick, if not in the carot.
---
Amazing. Every word of what you just wrote was wrong.
---
&gt; Masteries.
---

---
I think you misunderstood the mastery system. It's not about specialization (like especs) or something like that, it never was. Masteries "replace" the lvl treadmill you know from other MMOs. 
---
Instead of getting a new max lvl every few update, which includes the grind for new lvl, new weapons, new gear and so on, the mastery system doesn't have this grind aspect and doesn't make you previous achievements obsolete. Instead you get some unique abilities who can be very benefitical or even necessary to play certain parts of the game.

Aham znaci onda mi se i vise isplati da placam u dolarima ne?
---
Why? You already blocked him, you'll never read him again.
---
Let people decide what they want to do, individually. You have no right to block on other people's behalf.
---
That's how it works in communities pal. The majority sets up the rules. Agree or leave. Or get banned, if the appropriate language level is too much for you.
---
And continue thinking you're the man, so mature, so thick-skinned. It's even better.
---
Heavy's with pistol or light's with a bow when, anet?
---
Let's hope that day comes soon.
---
I don't really care for new elite specs if all they'll do is give you different ways to play fractals with. This shouldn't be the major selling point of an expansion/season, it should come alongside new content. HoT introduced them decently enough, but IMO skills/new weapons shouldn't come out at such a snail's pace because it is a selling point. Almost 7 years in and we got 2 new weapons for each class. This is such a dumb way to generate interest it's annoying.
---
I don't. Anet does. I (we) support this decision. Anything to add ?
---
Pa nzm kako se kreću dolar i evro na kursnoj listi trenutno a i ne verujem da je neka ogromna razlika. Svakako sve to ide preko banke i njihov je posao da prebace sa dinara na dolare/evre tako da ne treba da se plašiš ničega.

I’m all about that scepter + focus combo. Vizier khilbron, Razah, or Togo!
---
I'd really, really, *really* love if they [updated the guild system similarly to what ESO just did.](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/56483) You can search and apply for guilds through an in-game system.  Guilds can write a full-page message/description for their guild to show in this system. You can ping your guild in chat, which gives a chat-code showing your guild name, and when clicked will bring up the message/description along with an application option.
---
Oke, hvala.

Replace "Eternal Alchemy" with "The All" and you're correct.
---
The All is the workings of the world known as Tyria and six bodies of power that is connected to the Elder Dragons.
---
Eternal Alchemy is the workings of all things, places, worlds, afterlives, etc. of all existence within the multiverse.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The reason people mistakeningly relate the two is because Omadd said to Scarlet that when she'd go in, she'd witness the Eternal Alchemy. So Scarlet proclaimed she saw the Eternal Alchemy when she got out. But all she witnessed (as we know at least) was The All, also known as the Antikytheria. But in reality, The All is to Earth's atmosphere and magnetic sphere as the Eternal Alchemy is to the movement of all bodies within universe.
---
It is true that the non-k models are not overclockable in the broad sense, but you can still tweak it a bit by fiddling with the turbo boost multipliers. Depending on the chip you wound up with and the motherboard you are using and so forth, you can sometimes get all of the cores to turbo-boost to the maximum frequency which, even in a game that is single thread dependent like GW2, might make a small difference in some cases, and can in some cases even impact that single thread because technically the one core only boosts to the max turbo frequency when the other cores are not under load, but all of this is, as I understand it, dependent on staying within power limits, so... well in any case the bottom line is that depending on exactly what's going on with your computer, it might not always boost to 3.4GHz when you're running GW2 and by changing the turbo multipliers you might be able to fix this.
---
The other thing that you can do is to make sure that your RAM is running at the frequency that it is supposed to. RAM usually (or always?) defaults to a lower basic rate when it's first installed and you have to tell the motherboard to run it at the right speed. I was pretty shocked to see what a difference this made to GW2 when I first fixed it on my computer. As it turns out, that one single thread that the game depends on can *itself* be kept waiting for data from RAM if the RAM is running slowly.
---
It's definitely possible, though maybe awkward to implement. Do they chuck 250 HP onto one S5 map? Or do you need to go do all tye core tyria ones?
---
Right now my main has more than enough spare points from world completion to unlock a third spec, but for other chqracters, not so lucky.
---
I'd like sword or rifle/longbow necro
---
The All is not a physical thing, so how one depicts it will vary. In Path of Fire, its depiction is changed from an orrery-like mechanism into an [octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron).
---
That said, I would argue it's only gotten more complex since Season 2. But half of that is due to an apparent change in direction of how The All and Elder Dragons work.
---
IMO mace just fits engi, like hammer does.
---
I 100% disagree with this.  The fact that Marionette was actually difficult made it fun and exciting; it wasn't a snooze fest like nearly every world boss they have implemented since then (especially now since Serpent's Ire was nuke nerfed).  Fun is subjective so what is fun for you is not necessarily fun for me or all the others that play the game.  Clearly a lot of people enjoyed Marionette or there wouldn't be as much clamoring to get it back
---
Also I don't agree with the idea that people shouldn't have to carry their weight during an event.  And just because you spend time on something doesn't mean you should be entitled to finishing it or getting those rewards.  if you're that big of a stickler for "wasted time" then just avoid the event if you think it's going to fail.  I realize this is probably too much of a big think for the "reward me now regardless of how well I do" gamer culture that festers inside GW2.
---
Yup. I don't think Jalis used a melee bo staff in GW1 but that's his weapon counterpart for Revs, I wouldn't say shields represented Glint more than anything else but that's what she got, and Kalla scorchrazor never really was described as using a bow, but Pyre did so she gets one by association as the one who saw his legacy fulfilled.
---
Honestly most Rev weapons are more tribute than literal.
---
Evolving living story as per LS1 to expansions and now back again. Getting rid of dungeons. Adding Raids. Changing the new game experience 3 times now I think.
---
They could just revamp it, it doesn't have to be a copy paste 100%, and from what I hear about the technical limitations that's what they'd have to do anyway, so might as well spend a little extra time making it 2019 applicable.
---
Criticism is fine. I have my own. I feel like PoF was kinda boring. I dislike that new players need to pay gems to get living world stuff. I don't like that WvW has no options other than paying (sometimes a lot of) gems in order to get a guild together in it. I have a bunch more.
---
Criticism is different than saying it's a disaster, or shit, or any other type of bad. I mean, I'm even fine with people thinking it is those things. It's just weird that so many people that think this game has absolutely nothing going for it, still play it.
---
After every nerf.
---
What outfits are these based on?
---
I disagree with almost everything you've said, though I respect the time you took to say it. 
---
-masteries are only set if you are doing a max dps meta build. I frequently look through my masteries after using a build template and find a few defensive trade-offs I want to make. It isn't logically possible for there to be 2 max dps builds for one class, but you can always take small dps hits to vary your gameplay. Masteries have more variety than raid leaders want you to think they do. Plenty of cool options, although they can cost dps. 
---
-runes were recently overhauled and most nonmeta rune sets got new life. As with seaweed salad, any time Anet creates a new optimal dps option it becomes mandatory. Anet successfully created new viable rune sets without displacing the top dps option and restarting the whole cycle. 
---
-Anet's horizontal progression for gear fits with their overall philosophy. I am so fucking happy that I don't have to grind a new gearset every LS episode/expansion. Sometimes I need to do some farming to optimize for a new rune set or something but I'm not constantly falling behind if I'm not keeping up with the grind. This is a big part of what allows me to experiment with a lot of classes and content types. I'm not falling behind in one just because I put time into another. I can also take breaks from the game and not be afraid to come back.
---
-Anet's content variety offers not just a little to anyone, but a LOT to anyone. Theit biggest flaw is that a lot of players don't know a lot of what's in the game because it's very hard to figure out that HoT adventures are fun, or roller beetle races or some of the obscure PvE event chains. It's all out there. Open World PvE is easy. That's ok. Things like Serpent's Ire and TT overlap with fractals for difficulty so there's a decent transition there. TD Garent requires solid teamwork as well, there are plenty of "tough-ish" bosses that just seem easy because everyone is doing things right. Raids and fracs are your PvE endgame but even dungeons are fun. 
---
I've got thousands of hours in this game and I'm a little bored of it, true. But it made me sink thousands of hours in. Like six thousand. I'm not mad that I'm having trouble getting another thousand hours out of it, I'm happy that it brought me so much fun and that I still enjoy playing it, even if I can't live in the game like I used to.
---
I'm on mobile and can't really re-rwad your post to address everything. But if Anet is delivering hundreds or thousands of hours of content, that is impressive enough for me. And I'll be back every new LS to play around more.
---
And almost all of that was done while providing us with open world content.
---
* LS1 almost exclusively was about changing the world and open world events.
---
* Both expansions were launched without any instanced content apart from story, only open world part.
---
* New game experience changes were affecting both story and open world
---
* Adding more features like raids or fractals while focusing on open world content and story, doesn't mean a direction change.
---
Easier than that; you are supposed to go to the guns of the airship and spam 1 until it dies in about 8 shots.
---
&gt;GW2 is being designed as a single player yet massively-multiplayer online role playing game; a single player MMORPG. The entire focus and trend of the game is being funneled towards playing alongside, but not with other players.
---
um, thats actually one of my favourite things about gw2 tho.
---
Oh right, I was thinking of Mordremoth..
---
I mean technically Season 5 should be on level with a brand new expansion launch. It might not have everything a expansion would but it should have a ton of stuff, including new elite spec.
---
The timegate itself wasn't exactly a problem when compared to how meaningless the tasks they had you performing per day were, as well as the sheer size of repetitive steps on the collections.
---
Fighting world bosses and doing Jumping Puzzles? Sure. Having you not able to progress because you can only charge one item per day without giving you anything else to do, at all? Bad.
---
Venari is the bow, Jalis is the hammer - not that Rev uses hammer in any conventional way (though I love it!)
---
Tribute indeed!
---
The wind up is because I'm really attached to this game lol. And hope is a powerful thing. I actually agree that I should have quit a long time ago - but I and a lot of 'hardcore' players hung on because we really, really like this game.
---
That time is over though, the hardcore scene is crumbling into dust as we speak.
---
As for what has changed it's quite simple.
---
1) Streamlined gameplay, classes are much spammier/faceroll now
---
2) Less content, we've gone from a raid every 3-4 months in HoT to one raid a year
---
3) Overwhelming focus on solo play completely ignoring group play - PvP, WvW, Fractal CMs, Raids all pretty much left to die
---
4) Reduction in difficulty, wing 5 was hard, w6 was pretty easy, wing 7 was really easy. The new raids are not designed with veteran or more skilled players in mind - which is fine don't get me wrong it's just not good enough for the hardcore scene.
---
I feel like too many games increase the difficulty by just increasing numbers, okay now the enemy has twice as many HP or in a 4x game they can build twice as fast. Sadly it's probably just not worth their time to tweak the AI instead.
---
Out of curiosity, what are some of these bosses that you refer to?
---
You don't have to fight Mordremoth yourself. You fight Mordremonth in Dragon stand with a hundred other people. You fight his mind in the story. Half the story in HOT is in the zones, particularly but not exclusively in the zone's meta events. If you're ignoring the zone's meta events, that's an issue because you're missing the best parts of HOT.
---
The Zhaitan fight was originally a five man dungeon and remained that way for many years. It was the story dungeon of Arah. Only after complaints but the solo community did it change to a solo dungeon, and in my mind it wasn't a necessary change and it's less fun than it once was. But on the other hand, lots of people do solo MMos and they  have a voice and they used it. It's one instance of Anet listening to a loudish portion of the community at the expense of the other parts of the community.
---
Walk Softly and carry a big stick.
---
To be fair a lot of enemy reflect skills don't have much in the way of warning animation that they're about to be fired off... Or they display none in the case of earth elementals. 
---
Unless you really know the game's enemies well your (obvious example) dual pistol thief *is* going to kill themselves with one round of unload because it's simply too late for them to hold their fire.
---
Make engineer turrets great again! New turretmancer elite spec!
---
I still need to get revenge on Haia. Can we target her instead? Varrk could brought into the kill zone for convenience (all my Synergetics alumni save Pol).
---
&gt;  if players adjacent to you were replaced with bots you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. 
---
I'd like to take a moment to say that you could do the same thing in Guild Wars 1. On occasion, the bots were *even better* then your average end-game player.  But there was an end game, and it was still fun to team up with players and their interesting builds.  
---
Guild wars 2 doesn't have *anything* like that feeling, and it hurts the game a lot.
---
The socialization is basically what kept me coming back lol. I love most of the gw2 community that i run into while running around (whether doing content or just goofing off), and my guild is like my 2nd family now.
---
Get 3 shared slots, stick some endless tools in them, and congrats, you nearly never have to pitstop for gathering tools again.
---
He already got "mace" in the tool kit, the wrench is also a mace skin if i remember correctly
---
for 2000 gem you can  😁
---
because those 2 hours a night are fun.
---
I HATED the enrage timer the when the first wing came out
---
I knew what direction the game was taking - and bummer us, it came true
---
It was a DPS quickly or die format in GW2 and this chokes the variety of builds in raids
---
Some people are fine with this, the constant powercreeping, but the content is NOT getting harder as time goes on, esp in open world PvE. The amount of boss mechanics are simply bypassed by people not caring and smashing their skills. There are no risks, simply WP back. But thats the problem isnt it. The second the content got harder (Vanilla to HoT), people complained, so we went backwards (PoF).
---
Anet needs to sit back and figure out what they want to do with the game as a whole. You can't progress the characters and not progress the content. This is why powercreep is an issue- and it isnt between different builds and so on. They have to put their foot down.
---
I'm **TIRED, ABSOLUTELY TIRED** of coming on just for a new episode, finishing the maps, doing a few events again and taking a break. The rewards are non-existant, and not because "wElL yOu NeEd To FiNd YoUr OwN gOaLs". I got 7 legendaries. I dont want to see more weapon and armor skins again. Its not something we want over and over again for 3 years now. There is no variations. We dont want minis either. Give us something like mount skins or glider skin, something else to work on that isn't done over and over again. If you can make content for the vets, you are also making content for the casuals. But if you're making content for the casuals, you're not making content for the vets.
---
Not to mention, the social aspect in this game is absolutely dead. Guilds are just a chat room you use. That is all there is to it. Anet dropping any plans to improve it is only going to sink it further. 
---
Can you imagine tho? Being lonely in a bloody MMO, a MMO ffs.

Doesn't Phlunt already have a sickass chair
---
I've been saying this for years.  I wish the moment to moment gameplay wasnt so good so I could stop caring
---
I do raid training. The number of newbie Mesmers I have to tell "never ever press 2 in a raid while downed"... For every one clutch teleport out of an instakill mechanic, there's like 30 teleports out of the radius of Nature Spirit, Geyser, Well of Blood, Search and Rescue, or just plain ol' "send a bunch of people over there to press F".

Hi
---
I currently main power BS in raids, but I need a condi class. 
---
Should I make condi BS or just make a condi mirage?
---
I also want to make a druid and tank chrono later, but getting condi first seems more important as there are 6 bosses or so that usually require condi more.
---
Eh, while that's *technically* CC, it won't cause an interrupt.
---
I’m glad we all accept that if rev gets greatsword it has to float and it has to be Balthazar’s legend
---
They have explicitly and for a fact stated that LW season 5 is next.
---
I know this already. I'm just stating what I would have preferred.
---
Why does this look like a teaser?
---
Holy hot cakes...I did not know it moved. I want it really badly now. The little army of chairs is so funny
---
There was almost definitely no expansion even started before the lay-offs. That was only 2 months ago. So even if they decide to make one, which I doubt, it's 18 months-2 years out. And LW 5 has been 100% confirmed to be next. I fully expect "Expansion Level Features" ( their term , not mine) to be rolled into LW now rather than any more expansions. They have blatantly stated in the past that they were looking at it, and wanted to do it. With the "re-focus" that came after the lay-offs , I think now is the time they had to make that decision. And I think no xpac is the decision they'll make.
---
With the newest gemstore addition I feel like I'm playing wheelchair simulator.
---
I haven't posted anything GW2 related for like 2 years probably (do not quote me on that). I played the game since launch but as you probably guessed I stopped 2 years ago, and the reason was simply that the content got very repetitive while at the same time I did not feel rewarded for repeating the same thing over and over. 
---
This is a very unpopular opinion, but as the years went by, I went from "GW2 offers fair linear progression for everyone" to "Jeez I wish I all of these raids and content could give me some stronger gear". It is possible that at the end of the day, linear progression as a means of rewarding players was a good system to test and see if it works, but I feel if I am going to do the same thing over and over, at least make it worth it and give me something besides cosmetics and occasionally pointless skills.
---
tbh , there is really no difference . Like none, that I see. They call it an xpac and charge you $50. Why ? New maps ? LW has those . New masteries ? LW has those. New story line ? LW has that. New elite specs ? That I understand , but I am pretty sure we're gonna get those rolled into LW 5 and charged separately for.
---
&gt;but I don't have the energy today.
---
I knew you were a Revenant.
---
&gt;  I do wonder what season 5 will be like with no expansion to predate it
---
The same as every other season except for 1.
---
Honestly, there isn't a huge difference between story steps of expansions VS Living World seasons. The only real differences are content dumps and the extra features of expansions (masteries, elite specs).
---
We've also seen a season follow on from another season - Season 2 followed from Season 1.
---
When an MMO has no subscription fee, the weight of a purchase *partially* shifts from the exact value of the product to what I believe is a vague subbconscious debt towards the game based on time spent in the game and enjoyment of its content and the social presence of its community.
---
Generally speaking, I would estimate only 10-20% of what you're paying is actually intended towards the item itself. The rest is towards a desire to validate how much you like the MMO and wish for its continued development.
---
Additionally... I think your sense of value of art and enjoyment is a little twisted.
---
&gt; I just can't imagine the scenario where you're happy dropping essentially 12-13 dollars on a chair in a video game.
---
Do you think artists do not deserve proper compensation? Would you not pay $15-$50 for an appropriately coloured piece of paper or digital file?
---
They could spread 250 HP across every S5 map, and release the elite specs in the season finale.
---
I agree with almost all of this , to SOME extent. 
---
However , it's only been 2 months since the lay-offs and "re-focus" . Now is their chance to show us something different . LWS 5 is make or break for a lot of the fan base , whether they know it going in, or not.
---
But that is for the fans that are still somewhat satisfied. Are they going to make the huge , sweeping changes that will satisfy the OP and a few other content creators that have quit ? No. They won't.
---
10am on a weekday?
---
Personally, I prefer having multiple classes geared out as I find swapping characters easier then gear: your mileage may vary.
---
LS4 has set chests in Istan and Thunderhead Peaks. (Sunspear caches and dwarven chests, respectively.) I belive Sandswept had chests that open after the djin meta and Kourna's nodes are nothing but chests as well.
---
The huge missed opportunity with masteries as they are now is not giving you that sense of "improvement".  
---
Take POF for example; a lot of the map was designed to be retroactively visited after you've collected all the mounts. Stuff like Jackal portals, high springer ledges, sea-level ledges and so forth. In fact, in places like HOT and POF, their are paths designed for those without masteries to access and masteries serve as shortcuts. These environmental obstacles are designed to tease you into the upcoming possibilities of gaining new abilities. But now the EXP gain is so insignificant that you never have that initial feeling of being initially limited than gaining freedom and the paths designed for those without masteries become deserted and unused even at release.
---
&gt;getting condi first seems more important as there are 6 bosses or so that usually require condi more.
---
Sure, but then you'd technically need a druid and Chrono for all bosses so.....
---
I would love an underwater mount. Either a shark or a squid or something like that.

And there never will be

Can we flag this as hate speech? I feel offended by this response.

No, you want [Shortbow](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Dreamer)...

When ArenaNet first talked about the Mastery System, I was really hoping it would be more robust, interesting and diverse like it is in Everquest. Hopefully in the future ArenaNet does more with the Mastery System. It has tremendous potential that's not yet been actualized.
---
Everquest's AA system was first introduced in 2001, and has been expanded upon ever since. Its an extremely robust system, allowing for tremendous horizontal expansion for a character: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/wiki/eq:AA
---
Except greatsword is ranged, so any bow will obvi be melee for mesmer.
---
Nah Mesmers need daggers. I can't see a bow fitting their theme. Feel free to prove me wrong.
---
I don't need sleep. I need g0Ld!1!!
---
Is it possible that they already have and are in the process of implementing? Sadly we don’t get to see a ton of the process, which is frustrating, but...
---
I see your point though. If we voice these concerns, they may learn about them and be able to enact change.
---
Aww, she’s so cute! This is great work. I love all the art we’ve posted in the last two days. Me and you and another person who put up something wonderful...an asura?
---
&gt;The only difference is that DE drops massive content updates so quickly that the majority of the playerbase doesn't care.
---
Because so many of these are shallow "oh shiny!" features that they toss in and then leave to fester (archwings, kubrows, kavats, dead mission types defection), or just another layer of RNG, grind and time gates in a game that already has far too much of it. 
---
Resource grind, resources that expire if you don't use them, affinity grind, focus grind (which have a daily), forma grind, reputation grind for the many factions (which also have a daily cap), grind for warframe parts, grind for prime parts to make prime gear, grind for prime parts to get things from Baro, grinds to get mods, grind to get Endo to upgrade mods, grind to get Riven mods, grind for Kuva to reroll Riven mods, grind more endo to upgrade the riven mods, grind to build a dojo, grind resources for Dojo research, grind to get a nice kubrow and then put it away because it's worse than a sentinel, grind for a nice Kavat and then put it away because it's also worse than a sentinel, grind resources for Cetus stuff, grind cetus faction rep, grind eidolons for quills rep, do it all over again in fortuna with the new factions and new resources.
---
This post is just a fever dream lol
---
I'm commenting on a post.  Why do you care?
---
Is this ANet's vision of endgame content?
---
Ever played axe/axe  power  berserker?
---
I respect your opinion too, but vehemently disagree with you.  It's ironic to suggest this, but what I want out of the mastery system is more of the same.  I think it's irresponsible to let a lot of what I consider the best progression system in the game to rust into antiquity.  Earning the abilities was more fun than it was to use a lot of them...
---
Considering that the last two elite specs weapons were both melee, mace is the last thing I want to see engi get.
---
It's just not a community driven game, and I've said what I needed to say about it.  I may not be relatable to everyone, but I know that I'm not alone.  My guilds are the only thing that kept me playing this past year.  It's harsh perhaps, but I can't fight for a game that isn't willing to fight for activities for my friends, Nika.
---
I do fractals everyday, 18g per day is a reach...
---
Flax... already has control over the council. He's the High Councillor.
---
Phlunt is the dean of Synergetics who has a seat on the Arcane Council.
---
Play however you find it enjoyable.  There’s no “wrong” way to have fun.  
---
The endgame focuses on achievements and fashion, but don’t let that make it sound lame.  Try it first, it might surprise you.
---
Just stay away from online community forums.  What is fun about hearing people endlessly complain about literally everything?  It’s a fun game.  If you enjoy it, enjoy it.  Don’t ruin it with complaints.
---
And... The wiki is your best friend.  You can go directly to wiki.guildwars2.com, or type /wiki in the in-game chat.
---
Haia is supposed to be dead, technically. After her ploy to kill the rest of the council was found out, Flax said he'd send assassins after her. But ArenaNet apparently forgot this and brought her back to life in Season 3. Same with Zamon's norn bodyguard who died in human noble chapter 1 but came back to life in HoT.
---
ArenaNet consistency at its finest. :thumbsup:
---
Nothing new for f2p.  It’s just to take the game for a test drive, essentially.  
---
If you enjoyed it then, though, I definitely recommend getting an expansion or even both of them.  They are well-made and very fun, and if you enjoyed the base game, they will both blow you away.  Anet worked hard on them, and nailed them both.  They definitely deserve $50 for them, and that’s not a bad price for thousands of hours of content.
---
Glint is shield, only Herald spec can equip shield
---
Other 2. There's only 5 trinket slots.
---
They could retroactively add one to Season 2. Which is what I would have preferred over raids, personally. But Season 5 + third set of raids is likely where we'll get our last two legendary trinkets.
---
I think people would be satisfied if the first tier was different for each trinket, even just a complete color change, and second to fifth were the same, in all honesty.
---
Berserk from Berserk: BLOOD AND GUTS
---
Anet employees are the judge and executor you like it or not. Companies usually have a chart like: you did "x" so you get "y" as punishment and the more "x" you do, the more punishment you get until you loose the access to your account (now I wonder if there is at least a "mute option" as punishment in GW2).
---
This is a really good discussion topic.  
---
Personally if it were up to me, I’d do a complete overhaul of all of the PVE loot tables.  The idea is to try and implement a “guaranteed/worthwhile rewards system” on top of the current “useless vendor trash loot system”.  
---
The idea is that if you defeat a difficult boss, you’ll have a decent chance to get some loot “that is actually good”.  The loot drop would be bind on pickup and be structured towards something that is useful for your character (e.g. an exotic weapon useable by your profession).  The loot drop would be on top of the “100% useless vendor trash” you normally get.  
---
The loot drop would also try to factor in the overall progression of your character.  The more you’ve played GW2 and/or the better gear you’ve got equipped, the better gear you will get through this particular system.  The loot drop wouldn’t necessarily be a weapon or armour, it could also be trinkets or ascended/legendary crafting mats.  
---
Lastly I’d make so that any item that can be obtained through the crafting system or Mystic Toilet would be sellable on the Trading Post.  Any item.  The main intention of this suggestion would be to stimulate the “extremely stagnant” GW2 economy as well as encourage more veteran players to craft items that could be useful to novice players.  The idea would be to create a “craft and sell” economy.
---
thats like when you throw down some traps and pull a mob into the center, someone always spreads them all outside of the damage area.
---
The mastery system was brilliant when it was first introduced in HoT because it took a decent amount of time to complete and required participating in a variety of content.
---
LS and PoF masteries have been a let down because they were too quick to complete, losing the sense of progression as a result.
---
I see Vinewrath fail lots of times.  You're looking at this from a veteran's perspective doing zerg fests with a RIBA group, then yeah it's a cakewalk.  Try taking a disorganized group of about 15-20 total players, many of whom haven't played it before or know the mechanics.  This is what some of the other non-RIBA maps are like.
---
Even more people then!
---
Only really useful for when there's No Pain No Gain instability. Otherwise core warrior is more favourable especially due to the additional CC.
---
I **need** mh pistol on Mesmer because not being able to dual wield [Lyssa's Gaze](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lyssa%27s_Gaze) is so annoying to me.
---
I'd love to see Ele or Nec with a longbow though, along with Staff Warrior, GS Rev, and Scepter Thief.
---
People have decided and it's been posted here that the hologram stampede gives you more per hour.
---
Berserker from Gw2 is more like Doom Slayer.
---
So angry that even yur rifle shoots fire, jumps into the fray and lob heads off.
---
Aren’t you sick of this attitude already? Some people here always whine how difficult it is for devs to do this or that. Ffs it’s what they are supposed to do
---
That's good to knos, thanks!
---
Out of JUST the arena ? I'm pretty sure it has a cap on coffer drops, just like stampede. Plus, that's 45 gold. Maybe to people who don't farm gold , that's a lot , but t people that do , it might not qualify as worth the time. To put it in a more harsh way , the people farming Dragon Bash now , with the coffers below 30 silver , are the people who don't do any research into how to make gold , and just do what's waved in front of them, even if it makes half or a third of what informed players are making .
---
BUT …. if you're having fun doing it , more power to you.
---
Same . And it depends on the festival. Dragon Bash has nothing for me except the dailies. If there were more in it, maybe I'd be doing more. But when the wvw xp bonus popped, I switched to that.
---
I think that’s all pretty reasonable. A break can do a world of good, and offer some perspective. I’ve had to do the same thing for another game.
---
I hope you start feeling better about the game later on, but in the meantime, enjoy your hiatus and your summer vacation!
---
I think this post is absolutely spot on. You really summarized a lot of my core issues with the game. I’m stuck in this weird limbo of living the game and wanting to play it, but unable to find any real reason or motivation to do so.
---
Go join a VG exp group, fake link LI and kp, and tell us how it goes dude
---
It’s literally 2 weeks if you ONLY do dailies. If you do 1 HoT meta and 1 PoF map meta each day along along with your dailies, it only takes 5 days. IF YOU FARM SW FOR 2 HOURS, IT TAKES 2 HOURS.
---
O: really. Coolio, but I was just trying to estimate numbers and make it easy I guess
---
WHY NOT BOTH???? (I’ve learned to love my warrior and they are. Dangerous)
---
This is like walking into a car stealership and asking if you should buy a car...
---
What do you expect people to say
---
But that will be so weird don’t you think? All of the things related to unlocking your elite - weapons collections for the elite weapon, etc. are generally built into the expansion. Are they going to build that into the first LS5 map? If not, will we have to wait months for subsequent maps to complete our elites? Either way it sounds kinda lame.
---
A craft and sell economy is hard to get right, but definitely feels satisfying.
---
this is kind of a case of ~~“git gud”.~~ do literally anything more standing still and spamming 1
---
This so much.
---
At least make story mode dungeons part of the golden path in the personal story...
---
I had those feelings already after a couple months of the game release. In fact I uninstalled after reaching the endgame at that time.
---
I'm sorry for who else kept playing and is now realising the state of the game but, for once, I'm glad I didn't waste more time with it.
---
i got it when i bought it years back without owning the edition before

---
"Don't misunderstand. I don't want raid or fractal difficulty everywhere. I just don't want to fall asleep at the keyboard.”
---
I wanted to comment on this. I personally like the solo experience in the basic game maps and it is a huge turn down for me that the expansion maps are so punishing to solo players. Chilled exploration is impossible and this is quite sad since the maps are so beautifull and yet it is either zerg or constant pain. I would like to explore the land and relax but... I am being murdered over and over instead.
---
That made me laugh.  Thanks Sky.  
---
@/u/phoenixofthefire - I think Path of Exile strikes a good balance.  Nike has a video of him fighting the hardest boss on his YT channel.  He compares fighting it to fighting somewhere [between 1-2 Giganticus Lupi's if that's any criteria for you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkKwLkTJbrg) I would argue that Nike has better gear that I'm ever going to have on any of my characters and he's still darting around, dodging and evading various attacks, animations and his flask usage (lower left) is a constant.  They're active defenses -- not just mana/health sustain.
---
Yeah, they aren't going to change anything as its been too long already. Company is in a downfall, the MMO doesn't encourage us to play with others or need to. I think I'm done with this game. So long o/
---
I am a very "solo" oriented player so you'd think the current design of a lot of the game would be very well catered to me and it is but I sort of don't want it to be. I am not a very outwardly social person(especially online) so I tend not to interact with other players much but I wish I was forced to.
---
I'd want sword Offhand for Thief. 
---
Name it Swashbuckler and call it a day.
---
Otherwise Ranger Offhand Focus, called Shaman, would be nice as well. :D
---
The content is already there too - bounties, adventures, mount races, etc. All could, **AND SHOULD!!!!!**, have been adapted to guild missions - all with relevant updated rewards.
---
And that bullshit excuse about some guildies not having xpacs, so they would miss out? That should be seen as an incentive to buy xpacs, not *"Oh well, lets DO NOTHING with guilds for years then."*
---
I really wanted Longbow on Elementalist since Specializations were announced with HoT, think it would be SO FREAKING awesome shooting fire tornadoes ect :D
---
you could solo all marionette bosses, but some wrinewath bosses (the ones with a lot of adds) are pretty hard to solo and the dps timers are way tighter iirc.
---
Every. Single. Time. I can hit Full Counter in the middle of twenty enemies and suddenly it's like everyone just stops and stares at me.
---
I want this too! Unfortunately the reason it won't happen, and don't hate me for saying this because its something that the devs have mentioned in the past, but designing a 1 handed weapon for elementalist is easier because its fewer skills, where as two handed weapons is double the work.
---
I actually really miss exploration such as in core or certain LS3 maps.  The game has been on a meta-crusade for a while now.  I'd love to go somewhere, climb somewhere, fly somewhere and start a collectible journey, but metas are more important apparently.  I don't know.  I think there was a big recoil early on in HoT due to difficulty; what I really want in-terms of difficulty, isn't even really "difficulty," the way I see it.  I'm not a fan of aRPG/mechanical difficulty.  I can enjoy it, but within GW2 what I would hope to see more of is actually just fights that have coordinated mechanics; run into this green circle, get this doodad, use this doodad, DPS!

Been noticing a lot of this lately. Lots of times I've seen people in dragonfall knock mobs sideways or *into* the escort circle, or reaper pull them in, etc. Dragon bash is the worst. Stampede at least makes sense since you're trying to steal kills, but it's mega annoying. Arena is just pure dumb, I just FB tome 3'd a mass of mobs, why spread them out?
---
You mean shortbow?
---
I feel that pinkish-purple mesmer would be a great fit for dreamer xd
---
note: playing during LW episodes release window with a f2p account also "unlocks" so you can play them when you get the addon without paying extra.
---
Now I am using a first gen ryzen threadripper (1900X) running at 3.9GHz. I have most settings turned all the way up with the exception of shadows and a couple of other things and player model limit turned all the way up. In highly populated areas I sit between 25-30 FPS with the camera zoomed all the way out. If I can get those kinds of numbers in that scenario on first gen Ryzen...3rd Gen is just going to blow it out of the water for game performance.
---
I remember having to grind an insane amount of exp for HoT masteries. It was one of the things that made me quit for a very long time. HoT maps were also a pain to traverse on foot so that didn't add them any replayability in my eyes. I did 2 map completions of vanilla maps with great pleasure, but the only map I had at 100% in HoT was VB. Purely because it had the only meta that did not fail half of the time. 
---
I get that many people want some challenge and possibly time sinks that give a better sense of progression. But it drives away the players thar enjoy the game as it is now. 
---
I was honestly very happy when I came back last autumn and saw all these changes. I wouldn't stay if all those grinds and ramped up difficulty were back.
---
Also fine: inquest armor, weapons, minis, maps, instances, inquest tonic, inquest in storyline
---
Not ok: chair
---
You could just not be a bigot and poof, no ban. Amazing, right?
---
I would love underwater elite specs, that you would be able to use along your other elite spec, you would switch to them when entering water. But I see outrage already lol.
---
You don't have to love, support or even agree with people around you. However, if you insult them, assault them, no, I strongly think you should get your ass handed to you. No matter how. This is an ideologic controversy and we won't ever agree on the matter.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. You have to suffer for what you inflict, period.
---
I kill 5 bosses nearly every day, usually it is daily anyways. Always full of people. But ye, I also do play at evening, not when everyone is working.
---
that's why I said it can be a few hours later
---
You will always have people who are too dumb or too lazy to complete content, why should it be dumbed down for them, how are they special? Because they scream the loudest?
---
The "re-focus" may not actually be a thing. With all the events I suspect they are moving more towards automoated systems that they can just switch on and off for events, in a sort of maintenance mode.
---
A recent job advert for Anet mentioned the need for experience developing for consoles. Maybe they are still working on another game, and GW2 is going to have even less developers. The "re focus" is just an assumption, or optimistic thinking by the fans.
---
I just want less common weapons to be used more. More good rifle, shield, hammer, mace, etc. specs.
---
fuck off
---
I can't remember if the last few events were disabled at daily reset or 8pm gmt
---
Well, for once it's refreshing to have a despicable person on the "good side". Like, yes, there are people that are asshole but are not vilain, and there are (or should be) vilains you don't want to kill but have to in order to save the world/your so/whatever
---
I must have either misread the two/three or misread the way your sentence was structured, my apologies.
---
Even so 2/6 can cause pessimism for some, I don't see why this is so unfathomable? 
---
People will only recount the most recent season because the company has changed a lot of the past 2 years. The focus has shifted in terms of less raid/PvP/WvW/fractal focus to purely story, the lay offs have been a big cause for concern, and companies just tend to change over time in terms of employees.
---
I wouldn't say GW2 is a competitive game that focuses on PvP even though at one point, they had ESL and tournaments.
---
So as far as some people are concerned, the last living story season was an indicator of what to expect of the company, 4/6 releases being on time. That is fine for some, but a cause for pessimism for others, especially when you consider what those releases include (minimal raids/fractals etc).
---
I don't see why this is so unbelievable to you?
---
The problem is hard timegates.
---
If you play more you should also progress faster.
---
But skyscales takes the same time, doesn't matter if you play 8 hours a day or only 2.
---
In my opinion the guy who invests 8 hours should be done a lot sooner with it then the guy who invests 2.
---
I don't think I agree with you regarding the story. I am what you would call a casual player, I played story mode with my elementalist with rare/exotic gear and struggled at some parts because mobs are mostly designed in a way that they focus you so you mostly have to run away and kite which is sometimes harder to do than to say. But after I switched to necro everything became super easy, so you could say it's different for some classes. But that is besides the point.
---
Story instances should be about the story. The way they are designed now is most of the time going in to the instance, learning a piece of info then fighting 3 waves of enemies, learning another piece of info, fightin 3 waves of enemies and so on. Fighting parts of the instances should be designed in a way that it makes sense and not prolong the story. There is a room that you cleared in the previous instance and is now "secure"? You still have to fight those 3 waves in another instance because why not. That's why I enjoyed the instance where you were at a party with kass and tried to learn info. It was designed in an interesting way and as far as I remember there was no fighting involved.
---
If you want hard content, higher tier fractals and raids were supposed to provide that, with an interesting side story, but according to you they do not. Don't bash the story for it because other gamemodes are poorly designed. Story mode should be focused on providing good story first, interesting mechanics second and good fights third.
---
I understand where you're coming from, but even that definition is based on whether you believe:
---
If I say I am a casual, I am a casual.
---
Or
---
If I act nothing like a casual (others might say this, I know you disagree), but I say I'm a casual, I am still not a casual.
---
My point was just that, the issue isn't the word or definition, but the framing of the definition, which is a lot more subjective in respect to this discussion.
---
just asking a genuine question, sorry if you got offended?
---
Yes, I'll admit to my endgame being centred around wanting to progress my main. I've done all the CMs of Wing 4 to 7, I have multiple gear sets for my thief and expensive agony and stat infusions. I have the skins I want. 
---
However, I have nothing much left to progress towards and one of the big issues here is that the mastery system is so much more anaemic than it was with HoT. So long as a tougher and more in depth mastery system didn't stop you from doing map metas and bounties, what is the issue with it being longer to give people something tangible to work towards?
---
&gt; Give us something like mount skins or glider skin, something else to work on that isn't done over and over again.
---
"But what about monetization??!" I think making mount and glider skins cash shop only is the decision that hurt GW2's reward structure the most. Hell, they could've given mounts some modular cosmetics like saddles and footstep particle effects and such. Gliders are just easy to mass produce, being mostly static items. But no, put them all in the cash shop and let people grind for the same old stuff. Then they can quit and stop buying from the CS altogether. Smart!
---
Quit about a month ago when it finally sank in for me that no meaningful changes or additions will ever happen for pvp and wvw.  And that sunny mounts in the gem store and grinding in game events for the equivalent of 1$ an hour is the mainstay content. 
---
So much promise in this game unfulfilled.
---
Thanks for your post. I have one comment and a question.
---
Firstly to my comment, I doubt that you will struggle at all with open world achievements or the required meta's even. I don't want to sound cynical at all, but you can do all of the things in the last 3 episodes solo. And the few collection things you need to do the meta for, there are enough random players around still in those maps that you will be able to get what you want.
---
As to my question, you sound like you are frustrated with feeling like you can't play stuff since you have so little time. What change do you want to see then? Because I feel like most solutions to mitigate that are things that I personally think would be bad: Like no raids at all, since they require time investment to learn, or making even raids auto-attack-able.
---
An MMO-RPG can easily make you play 2000+ hours over the years. It's what it even strives to do. If you have little time available, then the only thing you can "expect" to be able to do (in my opinion) is the open world stuff that is easier to do. I think that what you are experiencing with raids is actually a good thing. Because it means that raids are a bit harder and DO require more time to pull off well. Raid bosses aren't and shouldn't be just 10-man world bosses.
---
(I'm focusing just on a few aspects of your post, I share your sentiment on the things like the "new stuff doesn't push me closer to my goals" for example and to an extent also the fact that gear is very static and feels clunky often. You know you need zerker and that's it. I liked the suggestion of someone in another post where they suggested to pull stats off any stats from runes and give them more unique "effects", which would make them maybe more versatile and therefore switched out more often. Imagine swapping runes in between raid bosses for example, because the runes give you effects and interactions that are better only in certain fights.)
---
EXACTLY. Some people are so entitled its disgusting, like if you dont want to put effort in an RPG game what the fuck are you doing playing it? All RPGs i’ve played and especially GW1, took me hours and hours to complete some fights and to figure out mechanics, its part of the game.
---
Thank you for your reply. I was genuinely curious about which bosses were considered frustrating playing solo. I have always played the story the first time through as a duo and none of the bosses were particularly difficult. Then again, having two pairs of eyes to discuss mechanics definitely made the encounters easier.
---
Condition Damage, Healing Power, Concentration, Expertise would be absurd and heavily restrict the healer pool. This would make Condi Heal Firebrand over 20k dps why healing and providing permanent quickness and other boons.
---
Hmm. I don't like that interpretation , but it's not outlandish by any means. Hopefully it isn't correct. 
---
From what I recall , the "re-focus" was at least somewhat alluded in the road map posts , etc. Hopefully it isn't completely out of thin air. From the comments I saw around the time of the lay-offs, the "re-focus" seemed to be the most fitting explanation.
---
But I'm not flatly saying wrong. In fact , I'm saying I hope you're not right.
---
In my experience they *stop attacking* while Full Counter is up - kinda like how some enemies will hit Guardian twice to pop Aegis.  Or knock you down again immediately if you stunbreak the first knockdown.
---
FC works best on attacks with long telegraphs - I have yet to see an enemy cancel once they commit.
---
Don‘t get me wrong, I think it‘s cool that there‘s options for everyone, and if you‘re happy with the merch then good for you! 
---
It‘s just that I doubt that the majority of people is interested in funky colourful leggings. I‘m wondering why they‘re not pushing something that has a bigger demographic of potential buyers, like accessories; keychain pendants or backpacks.
---
Reminds me of the line Neo had in *LotR: The Chamber of Secrets*: "My name's not Kirk… It's Skywalker."
---
Partially because GW1 skills interact with each other, while GW2 skills all "do damage" and that's it. Mostly.
---
Do you scream full counter?
---

---
Ya'll downvoting this guy 'cause you know it's true.
---
Now downvote me too.
---
Last time when i wrote something very smiliar on arenanet forum i get ban :)
---
It is not all sunshine...nobody said that, but it is also not everything bad, how he says. Yesterday his headline on his twitch was "creating content where there is not" (or something like that).
---
Last time I watched his tea time...he already said he doesnt care about the game...and kept whining and whining...
---
There is enough to do in the game. The game needs changes, yes absolutely, but I am sick of people whining and whining. 
---
Some weeks ago, wow anet is communication so much...now buu fuck anet, they dont tell us anything....you just cant make it right for everybody...
---
why not both? i still want ls5 to come along for new content, but i would also love them to fix all the bugs throughout the entire game, give us lane 4 in ds, put in malyk and the 2nd pale tree, give us the nightmare court story, the top of mordies tree... anything else they chopped out of HoT...
---
as well as removed/chopped content from PoF returned to the game.
---
Thank you, I appreciate the time u took to answer. I'll try my best to improve on these aspect!
---
I know what you mean, but I think you are hung up on a technicality. I think OP worded it weirdly and didn't explain it the best. I think it's not so much about just the "rewards". You are right that they actually often add "tiers" to their achievments with interim rewards/skins and that is great. But I think what OP means (at least that is what I'm frustrated with here) are things that take A LOT of time and where you can feel or show off your progression in meaningful ways. One examples (if not the only one?) in the game right now is the Fractal God "progression" which is tiered and feels good to tier up each step. And other examples are things like gw1 had. Ranking up the Luxon or Kurzick ranks took a LONG time, but along the way you were able to "show" your rank. Also each rank increased your personal faction cap, which felt like a "nice to have". Overall, ranking up felt good. It took a long time and it rewarded something that felt like a progress and you had something to show off. Similar to the "meta title". I remembered many ppl running around with the tile "My Guild Hall Smells of Rich Mahogany" (for having 25 other titles), which is one tier lower than "God Walking Amongst Mere Mortals" (for having 30 other titles). It wasn't yet maxed out, but especially in the hay-days of right after the EotN release, it was pretty prestigious still. I'm missing this in gw2 and I think this is what OP meant originally.
---
Why?
---
It’s long term progression. Sometimes to strive for, which provides long term interesting in the game. It’s hard to be motivated to play your characters if you feel you can no longer improve them in a meaningful way. (This also goes for real life, incidentally).
---
&gt;how reddit whines
---
Assuming the forums are free of players wanting easier content. Skyscale fetch part was made easier because a disabled player in the forums asked nicely.
---
&gt; he lives and breathes in literally all game modes
---
thats part of the problem. He is a veteran with thousands of log in hours, so his opinion doesnt really represent new customers and what they might want for the game.
---
Pvp is fine. wvw needs 500 reward track points per T6-tick. Couldn't care less about charr models or the zhaitan fight. Crafting needs better filtering and more uses. Other than that, I'd prefer more content and story.
---
&gt;tfw the entirety of guild wars 2 was just to bring krillin back to life again
---
&gt;It is not all sunshine...nobody said that
---
It's not what you said blatantly, but it seems like that's what was implied when you tell people to stop watching a person just because they're whining. 
---
Like yeah, just spouting negatively all day isn't a good thing, but listening to what they have to say can be informative too and can provide insight on what's happening on the other side of the aisle.
---
2h a day is a lot. Even 2h/week would be enough to socialise ingame.
---
A dungeon or fractal run takes ... 10 minutes? In theory this is the content in which random players would socialise with other random players (PUG). In reality in GW2 it boils down to "hi" "ty, bb". Because GW2 requires so little interaction (play alongside, not with each other) that this is all what is needed. GW2 is not "setting a spark", is not motivating players to talk to each other. 
---
Usually players talk about the game initially. "what build are you running" "heal xy" "oh, ok, I'll go dps then. Can you bring skill xy, or should I?" as example. If someone is nice you might do a second dungeon afterwards together. Add each other to friendlist or invite him into your guild. But this requires the game to motivate players to talk to each other. If no communication is needed ingame, then no one talks, interacts. As in most open world content. While GW2 content requiring a bit more communication has resulted in guilds forming, players talking. Mostly dungeons/raids/fractals, but also WvW or some rare open world content (tequatl, tarir-farm-guilds, triple trouble).
---
Anet listens to feedback as long as its convenient for them. But they won't delay content that might bring new and old players back just to please reddit.
---
Dont want to be rude but the facets were explained in the "mini games" before the bosses in LS2, Balth there is no strat, just avoid aoes, and the soul eater had a bug that was fixed. Tthis one, I admit, with the bug on, was a challenge. But still beatable. You had to stay at a considerable range and everytime he ported to you you had to port away.
---
This is an RPG and it should not be free the bosses you kill. That frustration you feel likely is due to the fact that the rest of game is brain dead and easy you got used to it. So when something slightly challenging comes, you actually feel frustrated.
---
I would give normal mobs in open world a reward boost and a specific item drop. At the moment there is no reason to kill a mob in the open world, if you want loot in the open world you should do the world bosses or meta-events.  So I would give mobs in a specific area a specific item drop. (most likely a crafting material) This way we can  revitalize certain maps again. e.g  mobs in Plains of Ashford have a higher (alot highter) chance of dropping linnen scraps.   
---
And I would bring back the profession colored champion mobs from GW1. That way new players can farm more specific certain bosses instead of randomly going al over the place. 
---
  
---
AND ofcourse a rework of all the old world bosses from 2012
---
intents
---
Mesmer needs to get warhorn, and get a support/condi spec called Bard :v
---
r/angryupvotes
---
It's not long since the last upate and already reddit is moaning about a content drought.
---
And you want even more of that?
---
I agree and I played d3 hardcore for first seasons at top 10. Wich was fun but at later season you had to grind hard to get gear to still progress. I think gw could totally have the intresting fights and hard fights without the geargrind. Getting hit by agony insta kills you as old fractals were on higher levels. You needed to time and communicate your reflects, you actually needed to use blinds on chanters to not get oneshoot at cliffside ect.. so the things are there they just need to give us some challenge..
---
I can see problems in wvw rest seems fine to me. 
---
i'd rather go for option c : 
---
get alliances going and work on new content meanwhile. thats what they doing (although a little slow on the alliances part) so im happy.
---
Yes, agree. i liked to watch him play pvp last season with niko. But the last weeks he is just annoying with his whining.
---
fanboy or just a snitch?
---
This guy knows how to find big-eared singles in Metrica Province
---
Ppl downvote but it’s the truth and a vast vast majority of players would agree with you not OP. Reddit community is rather tiny.
---
easy powercreep
---
Greataxe Guardian for lot of CC (GA is usually in most games a massive CC weapon)  ... Would love it.
---
You know, I like all those ideas, but they still sound like something I'd feel pressured to get as quickly as possible. 
---
Basically it's a ton of grind for the stuff that wouldn't have much impact on the veterans who seem to want more challenging content, but more casual and new players would be having a harder time without it. 
---
And I don't think any raid nerfs would be good for GW2. An easier raid mode with worse rewards to attract the people who don't raid - perhaps, but unlike WoW raids here do not get outdated.
---
Probably cos we're talking about the difference between core warrior and SPB.
---
Why are you so defensive about this game? Do you not understand the infinite untapped potential that this game has? Are you not frustrated over it as well?

No, as veterans we don't necessarily want more challenging content. We want things to work towards that offer a tangible benefit. The game is in a terrible place for character progression - in terms of systems, balance and previous PvE content being designed poorly and forcing entirely different professions (not elites) - where the expectation isn't that you improve your character but rather just create an alt that does the job much better. More elite specs would fix that but they don't offer progression either for people sitting with copious amounts of hero points! 
---
I'm glad you feel that you would be pressured to get them done - clearly they are appealing ideas. However, how you decide to deal with that motivation from the game is entirely on you and it rests on you to moderate things. Having things to *want* from playing the game isn't a bad thing and the game shouldn't cater towards people that can't self-moderate by just making things easier and quicker to achieve to the point where it takes minutes rather than hours or days. 
---
Raid nerfs could be the easy mode (which we definitely need). Raids not getting outdated is part of the problem with progression and a sense of achievement. It is boring to do VG after almost four years and gain nothing substantial from it.
---
However, this discussion is about masteries and the lack of tangible progression and I don't want to get side tracked into a discussion on raiding difficulties!
---
it is the T3 Human light armor headpiece :D
---
It's nice to get an insight in how an artist works :D
---
My thief has been screaming stealth with a giant uncomfortable scythe for ages so I don't see the problem really
---
That's a lot of suppresed rage
---
i did dhuum cm and im doing fractals everyday. i had both static groups and pugging a lot. to me there's little difference, you just look for players who know what to do and everyone does their thing correctly = win. 
---
and maybe raids aren't as soloable, but fractals and dungeons definitely are, so when its necessary and you are skilled, you can carry your group and its basically like playing solo game with bot npcs helping you (xD)
---
RPG progression and mechanics are fun for me, I don't just mean traditional vertical and Item level progression. This is why I enjoy Single player RPGs. Unfortunately in GW2 this progression is so short I hardly notice it and there is no option to CHOOSE to repeat it if I wanted to.
---
Also you seem to get the idea the progression = power creep when OPs post was about master system, which is more horizontal progression similar to a Zelda or metroid-vania game.
---
If masteries replace leveling, why can I never repeat them like I can leveling?
---
So I don't want to jinx it, but so far this solution seems to be working. Just have to hope that my phone has enough data left to do this.  
---
Thank you a lot
---
&gt; Masteries
---
Masteries lost any ability to feel like progression when ppl raged that they were mid-term progression until anet nerfed them to the ground to cater for the immediacy culture.
---
&gt; difficulty
---
Open world can't get too difficult. Or it leads to one of the following
---
* content ignored by most of the playerbase (like the vabbi meta was)
---
* content that can only be completed if you participate in some organized run and spam "join" to get in the map, and extremely rarely works if you just play it as part of open world (like TT)
---
* frustration because, no matter what, a good chunk of the open world population will not care enough. Like all those breakbars that never break.
---
What should we show u? litterally
---
Go to YouTube and watch mesmer warri and soulbeatlst pvp video or guardian... I bet you see plenty of footage from them oneshotting other players that don't dodge or have area awareness. And btw at half hp I litterally thought why don't press dodge because it wasn't an instant one shot... And. Took him a good 1.5 seconds
---
haha nice i haven't played GW2 so long time ago, i have few chars such as thief maxl lvl some ranger and elementalist but always like to see what's happening within game.. and oh yeah i need 200 gold for flying mount, I've finished last story mode and got all other ground mounts as well..
---
We're not talking about insane additions to the game, every game can be infinitely good. We just need it to be good enough. GW2 unfortunately is infinitely disjoined with its priorities, leaving mediocre-all-rounder game. It's not planned, not executed purposely. It's random. An effect from changing directions over and over again - that is frustrating - that is why so many people got pushed off over the years and don't tell me "GW2 is as alive as ever" despite that, because I've been around when GW2 felt alive and well and felt like it had something going on for it, felt like we had our backs covered by the developers, for a fraction of the game's history it did great and it's all gone now. In many ways. Then this Living World/Gemstore spam happened and the game is where it's at right now, admittedly it is going in a steady direction now, but it costed almost everything and to top it up - was this the right direction? ArenaNet clearly have no intention to change it. They managed to do amazing things even though the game was tackling multiple areas at once. Doing one singular thing like they do now and investing so much into it is far from ArenaNet's best.
---
They compare, because core warrior is still a better choice vs Spellbreaker
---
On the topic of CC; 
---
Headbutt is part of the rotation for berserker warriors to keep up berserk mode and can't reliably be counted on to be up for part of the break on certain bosses.  Comparing just the bursts of mace between Berserker and Core Warrior:  Berserker gets 320 breakbar damage over 8s, 100 of that damage is right away while the other 220 is over 8s (5s of blind, 8s of cripple).  To do more breakbar damage, however, you'd have to give up doing your power rotation with axes and a few of your bursts. Which, if you're taking berserker, is where all your damage is at aside from offhand axe 5.   Assuming you can work headbutt into the CC rotation, you'll do a total of 400 immediate breakbar damage with a single burst and another 220 over 8s, which is slow.
---
Core warrior doesn't give any of that up, as it doesn't have to use its utility skills to spam a rotation and has access to kick or Bolas which it can spam off cooldown for less of a loss than a berserker spamming headbutt (Rare cases of using headbutt out of berserk mode.).  The Core warrior can get 450 breakbar damage quickly with a single burst with skullcrack and kick.  With Bolas, it's 500 over 4s (300 from skullcrack stun, 200 from the immob.)  Core also has access to Empower Allies, which is a nice party buff and doesn't have to manage berserk mode uptime nor does it rely on lacking stability to keep berserk mode up.
---
Both have their uses, both are fun in their own right, and in most cases, the difference in CC is negligible enough to get away with playing berserker over core.
---
I always read the wiki, but for LS2's Malevolent Memory I needed another player to help me because I just couldn't do it. The combined mechanics were way too damn difficult with the intense damage pressure of the boss. I kept running for my life through the whole fight, unsuccessfully trying to reach the specific spots of the area to do the mechanics before they disappeared. It was grueling, and I hated it. Which is really not the emotion I'm looking for when playing a game mostly for the story and the exploration.
---
Because the ability to show off what you buy drives people to buy things. There would be little point to character customization if other players just toggle your stuff off, so no point in buying gemstore cosmetics.
---
It's because of the white, maybe greys or black would fit better.
---
lennyface
---
Yep seems to have been the same problem here, probably also should get a vpn in case it happens again.
---
If you really have to produce shitty fake leaks for the second time now, why not at least make something that's remotely *believable* or *possible*, and not just some utter bullcrap?
---
Okay. Than stop playing and find something you like more. Problem solved for everyone! You don't have to deal what you feel is a mediocre game and people who do enjoy the game don't have to listen to your whining about it not being as good as you want it to be.
---
It is faster if someone buys you bigger bags, and speeds up your crafting, and maybe gifts you the salvage o matic
---
You need to train it first. Getting the EXP to fill the yellow bar. When it's full you can unlock it with mastery points.
---
You need more experience...the bar next to the ✅ has to be filled
---
Is it hard to understand that Tpot would leave if it weren’t for the fact that he’s literally the biggest streamer for gw2? It’s hard to leave behind a big community you made and being one of the most famous content creator despite the game going downhill. Him whining all the time isn’t right but it’s not like he’s wrong about it either. Anet chose to not listen to the community, they chose to not communicate at all with us, they chose to kill WvW and kill pretty much the whole game with powercreep and they refuse to discuss why they came with those balance patches.There is so much wrong and there is so much they can do to slowly put the game back on track, but instead they don’t listen and release a 2h worth of content every 4 months.
---
Ohhhh thanks! Im new to the game lol 👍
---
Maybe just use @everyone or @here then, that people can choose how they get notified for.
---
Or maybe (and I schrudder at this solution), they'll take the same road as legendary weapons : they are focusing on a few select elite spec per episode.
---
Maybe episode 1 covers all 3 scholar elite spec, or maybe one elite spec per armor weight ? And then by the time episode 3 is released, and class have their elite spec. 
---
It would balance out the amount of content for players/work for devs per episode over the season, but I can already smell the sea of salt of players not getting the elite spec of their main as quickly as others.
---
&gt; we've been here for... What, five years or so?
---
The game launched almost 7 years ago :) By now even people who started when it went F2P have been playing for 4 years.
---
You can silence all of them anyway. You get notifications, but without sound or vibration. 
---
Why would you ping everyone when not everyone  is being invited to specific raid?
---
And double Bow Ranger.
---
Your exp bar for the print key is not full yet.
---
I mean the effect around you is a dead give away :P
---
I was actually thinking about a 3-skill for sh/sh that was a kit for a kite shield for tanking or supporting allies.
---
Currently messing around with roaming builds for WvW, need some advice. When roaming I tend to play Thief, Rev, Mesmer, Reaper or Ele. But I can’t quite seem to find a build that really clicks with how I want to play. 
---
1) What armor runes do you like to use when roaming? And for what class/build? I am seeing people using durability runes, do people build glass and then use dura runes for survivability? 
---
2) I see lots of advice to build glass for most builds  (full zerker, or zerker/marauder), but I watch videos of people wrecking on let’s say a sword weaver in 1v1, 1v2 situations and their build will be using knights and valk and even some cleric pieces. How do I gauge how much of what stat to bring to to table in what situation? I know most of this just comes down to experience, but figured I would see if anyone had any advice for what could be answered here.
---
Honestly? Yes, I want everything that has any impact on my day to day gameplay to be easily attainable. So that I could be done with it for good and go back to doing what I like without feeling like I'm missing out on something.
---
I'm not even making an argument, just talking about my experience and my point of view. We obviously want different things from the game, no point in arguing here.
---
&gt; Headbutt is part of the rotation for berserker warriors to keep up berserk mode and can't reliably be counted on to be up for part of the break on certain bosses.
---
Headbutt can easily be used as an opener only and completely neglected for the rest of the fight. Since this comment chain is in part about fractals, a warrior in a fractal group is expected to bring banners, which means no Outrage to mitigate the self-stun from Headbutt, and as such there is little reason to use Headbutt mid-fight, you'd be better off just spamming weapon skills and Decapitates.
---
&gt; To do more breakbar damage, however, you'd have to give up doing your power rotation with axes and a few of your bursts. 
---
So how does this not affect core warrior? You also have to switch to maces and give up on spamming axe skills. You also spend adrenaline on mace F1, and you spend 30 of it instead of berserker's 10, requiring you to take a longer time regaining it before you can use axe F1 again.
---
&gt; Which, if you're taking berserker, is where all your damage is at aside from offhand axe 5
---
Axe weapon skills are just as effective as on core. Mace weapon skills - for those couple of hits you'll have to do with them before you can swap back to axes - are just as effective as on core.
---
&gt; Core warrior doesn't give any of that up
---
Disproven above.
---
&gt; and has access to kick or Bolas
---
No reason a berserker can't take these. Sure, it's going to result in somewhat lower dps than passive +power from signet (which I find to be extremely sad, when passive buffs are better than active use of class mechanics), but still nowhere near at low as core.
---
Also if you're doing it right, you shouldn't have these physical skills off cooldown during long fights, so one can make the same argument here as you're making about Headbutt.
---
&gt; Core also has access to Empower Allies
---
Sure, I'll let you have this one.
---
&gt; nor does it rely on lacking stability to keep berserk mode up
---
Only if you're playing without banners, which is a rare blessing.
---
So let's crank the numbers considering all I stated above:
---
Berserker:
---
[Mace F1](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skull_Grinder): 100, 0.5s cast
---
[Mace 5](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tremor): 300, 0.5s cast
---
[Mace 3](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pommel_Bash): 100, instant
---
[Headbutt](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Head_Butt): 300, 0.75s cast
---
= 800 with headbutt over theoretical 1.75s
---
but by the time you're done with Headbutt, F1 is almost off cooldown and can be used again, +100 (missing out on axe bursts is a bad argument - weapon swap + 1 weapon skill = full adrenaline bar). And one more time with healing skill off cooldown if you're truly starved at CC, which, let's face it, isn't your problem at this point, as you've contributed to the breakbar way more than any of your groupmates (while quite often also having higher dps than them).
---
Core:
---
[Mace F1](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skull_Crack): 300, 0.5s cast
---
= 700 over 1s
---
Excluding any soft CC, as they take often too much time to be useful.
---
Also not counting Kick, because both core and berserker have access to it.
---
So, higher breakbar damage, but a somewhat longer delivery time. But the only cases in fractals where this difference will matter, to my knowledge, are the breakbars of Cliffside's and Chaos' final bosses. But even they are like 2-3s long.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
If only we had their internal stats. I'd like to see their attrition rates.
---
They do seem like HoT/PoF maps, but they are f2p.
---
One is west of Queensdale, one is South of Wayfarer Foothills. Probably so new players can get funneled back into the regular early-game if they want to, idk.
---
I'd feel more worried as a warrior. Speaking as a PvE player, the banners make up for mediocre damage to keep them meta. To keep game balance we'd be looking at drastic changes all around.
---
Iirc its completely random which recipe shows, so 1 in 6 for the pants. 
---
That means not seeing specifically pants in 14 days is pretty unlikely but with about 7,8% absolutely possible!
---
I think if they wanted to have some sort of paywall. Put the expansions on sale for the whole of season 5 and to play it you need HoT and PoF. Don't go back on "living world is free to play". This would also stop the annoying "when does GW2 go on sale" reddit posts. I mean $20 isn't that back in terms of £s but one of living worlds selling points it free story updates.
---
Same here. I like him.
---
How many times have you returned to the game then?
---
I've always thought that a cool thing is to mix a trait line coming to an other class in order to have a secondary class...but these are only my thoughts
---
The replayability is great, no doubts about that. I've got one of every class, with duplicates too. But it doesn't mean the rest of the game is any more fresh. Fractals are the same at its core. Raids - same story. The personal story is linear and finite, not to mention released at a snail's pace. If players aren't hooked here, there's nothing left to offer. PvP, WvW? Maintenance crew. 
---
So to bring it back, as vets who have seen this for several years now. Got anything else to offer or are we at the end of our lifecycle with the game? I think that moreso than any issue with the game itself, of course from a 50 foot aerial view.
---
&gt; unless they really add something crazy like mounts, which would be an expansion level content.
---
...which is why we got 2 new mounts during season 4? That's like the worst example you could've given
---
That's an Argonian!
---
It still carries over to next year though so you won't lose any progress
---
And yet everyone complained about how long it takes to get skyscale.  Understand that no matter what ANet does, they won't be able to win for everyone.  A group of people will always be so pissed they are leaving the game because it was ruined forever.  Gone are the days when people took what they could get, because the internet has become pure outrage culture, where if a business is not catering directly to you and your specific subgroup everyone deserves to be fired and the game is terrible.  I as a result have a real hard time taking posts like the above seriously... 
---
I am a veteran GW1 and GW2 player also, having played since one month after launch of GW1, and two days after launch of GW2, yet never run out of things to do that I find interesting or fun.  Just like people say that defeating tougher content is a "get good" problem, the onus of continuing to find enjoyment in the game, ESPECIALLY socially which is a major point of the OP , is on the player.  I have NEVER ever had any trouble finding people to play the game with, not just adjacent to.
---
Someone else said "keep the hardcore players happy because they spend the most time on the game" but I don't necessarily agree.  I would wager that the casual players so massively outnumber the hardcore ones... by a factor of 90 to 1 or more (obviously speculation based on observation and no one has the actual numbers) that they spend way more time on the game as a whole and arguably the casual player who doesn't dedicate time to farming or grinding is much more likely to spend money on gems to convert to gold to get the things they want instead.
---
This post makes no sense, the expansion won't be released anytime soon, either they cancel or not the elites, it isn't the only heavy lifting of a expansion after all. They would have more than enough time to give us more elites when the expansion hits in 2+ years
---
I guess no one likes a good IT Crowd reference. Noted.
---
He didn't mean more mounts, more like an addition on the scale of mounts (Ex: player housing, boats, etc.).
---
ppl are hyping up the xpac content for season 5 and i can already hear their disappointed cries
---
TBH it started as just a reply to you and then went off from there.  The original point was to illustrate that people scream about things being too quick and easy, then scream about them taking to long in the next breath.  There's almost never any reasoned and measured response to anything anymore, and honestly it's exhausting to me.  It's not just here... every game I play, or have tried to play now, I see this.  FFXIV, ESO, GW2, Destiny 2, Warframe.  There's always outrage from one side or the other... or sometimes from the same side even after they get what supposedly they wanted and asked for.
---
If they do that, then it'll be a few years of no more content. Best way to transform the game into a dead zone.
---
Yellowstone is errupting.
---
I really like this concept
---
They already said that LW5 is coming with something "expansion worthy" (if I remember the exact phrasing correctly), and I think it's clear that if a third expansion is indeed far off that it makes including new elite specs now even more of a good idea.  
---
Of all the kind of content that expansions come with, I think elite specs are the ones which by far get the playerbase most excited, draw old players back to the game to check things out, and keep players engaged the longest. People really get excited about what feels like a new class, and more importantly they act as a kind of multiplier effect making the *rest of the game* feel new again. Someone who had done the HoT metas 1000 times on his Tempest can all of a sudden do them on his Weaver and it feels fresh for a while. This is especially true of more casual or average players, who take a lot longer to get used to and learn the new classes.
---
I think that the game cannot possibly survive another two years if it's just the kind of LW content we saw in seasons 3 or 4... a new story that takes a few hours to complete every several months along with a couple of achievements for the hardcore players. Something like new new elite specs are a necessity if they intend the game to last much longer.
---
This is bad...
---
Maybe they will implement a new race. It is a lot of work but it could open doors for much new content on the long term.
---
This have nothing to do with expansions.
---
Leveling with or without is exactly the same.
---
Everything you listed aside from KP is already easy to get and that's exactly how I like it. 
---
Again, I see your point. Threads like this sometimes manage to make the devs think. I just don't want to see the game I really enjoy turn into something I'd rather not play. Already had it happen with another MMO and that was quite a blow after almost 10 years.
---
Helping newbies learn to raid, mostly.
---
They said that Living Story will be containing expansion-like features. The only difference between LS and expansion is that LS is released periodically and expansion in a big chunk with way longer waiting time. Nobody enjoys waiting times yet many people still brigade for expansions instead of periodical releases. If they cna deliver it without expansion, they don't reallyn eed expansion, the only difference would be in name and that people would hate expansion instead of LS (there is always some reasons, be it too long, or too short, or whatever).
---
Time will tell. I do like this Starcaller apperance idea, its 100% fits my mesmer.
---
Basically you cast Chaotic Release (glint ultimate) and immediately stow your weapons. Animation plays, opponent dodges but ultimate isn't cast, so you can recast it shortly after. So you bait a dodge or defensive cool down.
---
Same can be done with Shiro ulti IIRC.
---
This post comes off like Stockholm’s syndrome. “We don’t need elite specs because ArenaNet neglects adding adding new features all the time! Really guys, the game is fine as it is! Just cancel LS5, we don’t even need anything added for another 2 years!”
---
Are we doing the personal-wishlist-as-fake-leaks thing again?
---
&gt;Of course I can't prove it, but call it a strong hunch that you downvoted me, as we were the only people at the conversation at the time. Each of my comments were downvoted within a small time period you responded. You know it and I know it.
---
What ever you want to believe man.
---
probably underwater mount, a new fractal and a map. enjoy your expansion content!
---
If you want to call something nonsense, you should state how it doesn't make sense first.
---
Skald is alternate for bard. I showed evidence from wiki and the fact that a Skald NPC resides in Bard's College. So that makes your previous comment about Skalds being different than Bards 
---
nonsense.
---
There are as much lore inconsistencies in gw2 as Skyrim, if not more. That makes your position of ignoring the warrior bards in Skyrim due to lore inconsistencies, and therefore disregarding Bard spec for gw2 warrior, nonsense.
---
Your points are still wrong even though you refuse to discuss them.
---
The have added 2 mounts in living story since the release of PoF.
---
You consider that as a new expansion after PoF?
---
The biggest shame of GW2 will be the reallocation of resources meant for it to other projects, as it shows how much Anet sees the game a money farm than an actual long term project. Remember when they claimed they had a "10 year plan" for the game at launch?
---
Aka Daredevil.
---
probably just one guy with alts
---
Channel Turai Ossa!
---
When you put it that way... Warframe is a lot like a mobile game, just one with good graphics and good combat. It's pretty much pulling all the same tactics and effort a well funded mobile game does.
---
mediocre dmg? the dmg is far too high for being the bannerbitch
---
Players like Teapot and the others on his podcast are the 0.0001% of the player base. He's put thousands of hours into GW2 and cleared all of its content on multiple accounts. 
---
That just proves anet did a good job with the game and that its worth the money and time. There's no dev out there that can output content quickly enough for their fans to keep up with.
---
Maybe every class gets their own type of bard.
---
Thundercaller, Skald, jester, Lore master, etc
---
I farmed enough to clearly out the map currency merchant each week and then went back to helping out some friends with their Skyscale. I did enjoy the arena but it wasn't terribly rewarding compared to just about every other event activity.
---
I thought they were still looking into reinstating the old whitelist. That sucks, it will always be inaccurate now with most achievements for veterans now.
---
I still dont get why they should bundle their resources in order to satisfy players that already spent thousands of hours in game and probably already got most of the stuff from the gem store they want instead of focusing on making their product more attractive to new players, who still need plenty of skins/account upgrades from the gem store.
---
They said the same for LS 4, this quote is from September 11, 2018, in mid of season 4:
---
*"But now we're raising the stakes and we're actually starting to release what we'd consider expansion-level features, alongside these things, when they come online, when they're ready."*

Metabattle has roaming builds as well. You can also find roamers on youtube, they usually post their builds.
---
No in his case and probably 80%+ of the people who ever bought the game it is "Never".
---
I'm personally hoping for more maps closer to core tyria like how many of  season 3 maps were (Lake Doric, Siren's Landing, etc). Tired of the desert and jungle, give me plains and forests lol
---
I kind of want shortbow on engi. The theme being explosive/electrified arrows.
---
I also didnt think it was fitting for guardians to get a longbow and traps but here we are.
---
Why? It's a good lesson on what a shitty leak looks like lol.
---
At least they didn't steal any ideas from the forums this time (I think).
---
Wow that's really amazing, i wish i could draw like you, i really want sketch of my charactet too XD
---
If you're gonna spend time on a fake leak, at least make it sound a bit more believable, or add some punchline by the end.
---
I fully agree with you. Grinding upwards is to teach people the basics. Past a certain point (obtainable) everyone should be at the same playing level. However their CHOICES should matter. And given current balance state in gw2, choices are pretty limited.
---
you have no idea how long I have waited to make this joke
---
Not a single screenshot...
---
Feel free to sponsor abyssal dye  :D
---
&gt; karka queen with a 20-30 man guildgroup only?
---
You can already do this. You know those big World Event Flags that spawn, they allow you to do this. I've personally done karka queen, teq, and triple trouble.
---
You can actually create longevity through having an even playing field with player skill and capability improving, as well as alternating metas. This also allows people to start late / play casual but compete / quit and come back/ ...
---
Gw2 doesnt have meta shifts or even half decent balance. Of course things get stale. And frankly grinding out stuff wont change that, for me.
---
Wow... Well. That video was something xD
---
&gt; The hard-edge style is experimentation, and looks better with color or shading
---
Depends, IMO. I do enjoy colour, but sometimes monochrome shape complexity is what draws attention and makes the brain work. Stained glass without the glass, that kinda thing.
---
Kudzu still best legendary tho &lt;3
---
Ooh that's cheeky I need to try this (I imagine it's known enough to get countered a lot now though?)
---
Thanks for explaining :)
---
For me, its the fact that almost none of what I want rewards progress towards the goals I want.  For example, I would like to get the new legendary ring coalescence.  But I can't earn anymore of it through raiding.  I need 250 funerary incense.  So my options are doing legendary bounties that are so boring I literally fall asleep, doing a bunch of boring heart quests everyday that are so boring I fall asleep, or exchanging 5 crystal ingots per day.  I've made 4 sets of legendary armor using the faction provisioners.  Is boring time gating really the end game? Why can't I earn raid rewards actually playing the raids? I have nearly 2000 LI, and yet that isn't enough to get a fucking legendary ring? No thanks, I'm out.
---
&gt; You had to stay at a considerable range and everytime he ported to you you had to port away.

i was unlucky I went into it as Druid the first time, and had to keep my pet dead to prevent the healing on him, but i did eventually get it on the first try. My friend on her mesmer got screwed as it healed on the clones.

Thanks, I have been keeping an eye out and really don't see a lot of guilds advertising. It's something I am looking for while im "in town". Maybe the boss event will surface more folks.
---
Thanks, will be working on it.
---
But he is going to leave when WoW Classic starts, so...
---
Thank you, i've never really understood the servers thing. That at least stops me thinking I should make a new guy on a different server. Thanks for the advice, that's very helpful. I will prioritize finishing off the story content and go from there,  thanks again!
---
No idea why they downvote you...
---
And this is why I hate the gemstore...
---
Awesome thank you, I will check it out.
---
This is exactly the situation I'm in. A lot of the core of gw2 like fluid combat and standardized pvp is amazing. Unfortunately the game in it's current state is so unfun its not playable for me.
---
Gone back to games that actually have gameplay and team play that matters, even if the gameplay itself suits me less.
---
Agreed, Kudzu was my first legendary and still my favorite!
---
Put it up for Alzheimer's charity and I'be all over buying a pass.
---
I disagree about difficulty. There are meh easy maps where people roam strongly because, well, easy shit with good rewards. There are hard metas. The point is that they are worth the same or less than the easy one. (See Dragon Stand vs Istan)
---
Dragon Stand is an AMAZING example of good meta. Actually HoT entirely is harder and i think their metas are absurdly better designed than anything LS3 or beyond. Hard metas are indeed exceptions and actually, the point is that no one runs them.
---
Depends on how restricted it'd be or how costly multiclassing would be, but yeah quite possibly. I haven't played much of the Core Swap thing in WvW but it doesn't seem like it's changed that much.
---
I'd really rather just have more elite specs, but I kind of feel like they're gonna go for multiclassing because it doesn't really need any new assets and they wasted an enormous amount of time working on two games on the side (and indirectly got a third of their company laid off?) instead of working on the next expansion.
---
My sense of time sucks , sue me.
---
That's the thing, the games difficulty is balanced around treating fellow players as mindless bots you cant even communicate with.
---
If you could replace players by basic bots that spam 1 most of the content in the game would auto complete.
---
Bruh 0-100000 levels of anger. Chill.
---
bruh 😤😫💪😫😫
---
Generally I'm in complete agreement with you but given so many players want everything immediately with no effort so they can go back to doing the same thing over and over until they become sick of it and quit, I didn't think expressing that opinion would win over many hearts or minds.
---
I think HoT was great. The story could have been executed better but that is a complaint relevant to every MMO. It's one of the best expansions I've played for any game while PoF was a Warlords of Draenor level let down for me, saved by quickly moving into LS4, mounts and being able to use elite specs in the superior HoT content. I ended up missing the grind in PoF and even the "grindy" achievements like Shadow of a Shadow took me two evenings and a morning.
---
Just use balth as the legend, I mean why not
---
Nice!
---
tune in in 3 years to find out!
---
I think build templates will be a healthy promotion for being able to solve a level of that frustration. I still have yet to really go really play scourge as I've enjoyed reaper so much and am used to the play style. The effort to document my builds, ensure I have the right weapons and stats, etc really pushes me away from one of the things I really liked about GW1: absolutely ridiculous build play testing. Being able to transition between what I enjoy playing, what I want to test, and meta is something that's been needed since fractals and raids released at least.
---
Why do we have hundreds of story writers and artists over devs tho? Cant do basic updates, no advertisement, struggle to implement features, yet yay artists and story writers.
---
Hell the artists could be providing novel armor and weapon sets as rewards quite frequently. But even this is rather slow. The vast majority came with the core game.
---
once i finished up the annual and regular achievements and got basically all of the within-reach items i was interested in i stopped doing dragon bash stuff and went back to working on other stuff.
---
Alliances wont fix wvw on their own. Wont even address population issues properly. Too much neglect to finish in a half assed 5 years too late update.
---
how is this problematic to pay 60g for elite specialisation if its not problematic to pay $$$ for PoF/HoT to get them? 
---
if someone missed the living story and has to pay 60g, how is this problematic? are you trolling me? xD
---
Fire them and hire devs.
---
Doesnt change the argument. Why give them dysfunctional gear? There is no reason to use pvt or valk on most classes. Might as well give them nomad.
---
While I would like new elite specs, the thought of more power creep and poor balance makes me a little sick to my stomach.
---
No if you don't really care about the story in an MMO.
---
Have you followed this sub for long? People apparently don't like to be hated by anything.
---
Just imagine the reaction of players when they couldn't unlock the episode for free, now have to pay for it and is the next chronomancer situation.
---
Hello,
---
Welcome back.
---
\[PPK\] was purged completely 1,5 month ago or so. Nothing personal.
---
Not sure if you asked on the borders/teamchat, but quite certain people would have pointed you to the SFR discord (find it via link at seafarersrest.com ). There you will find how to apply back to \[PPK\]. Added bonus, you will be part of the community and get notified of public raids and all.
---
See you there.
---
Regards,
---
Riay
---
The fact is though, we NEED elite new elite specs. The game’s endgame scene will not last if we can’t get any new variety for another year or two. Raids in general have almost entirely been starved to death because of how bored the playerbase is. Adding an additional set of elite specs would do wonders for creating more diverse team compositions and revitalize raids/fractals.
---
Oh boy...
---
LS3 felt amazing in many aspects, and one of them i only realized short ago: the way you explored things was amazing.
---
Nowadays you just fly everywhere on point. But back then you had to look for the way to get somewhere - unlock masterys, jump on mushrooms, glide from updraft to leyline, use these dragonis mons tarzan things and now bonus points if you swapped weapons and utility skills a la dungeon run to get more movement out of them
---
Aside from hearts, while leveling your main focus will be dynamic events which are marked in orange. Every 10 levels you will also unlock part of your personal story, which by doing, you will gain lots of EXP.
---
Seriously? "Seek help?" I say that if you don't like a game you should move onto a different one and not just complain about the one you don't like and I need help?
---
Brilliant!
---
Contact the Support, had the same problem and they lifted my buying restriction.
---
Yes it might be a problem for people that is why I said it is problematic.
---
I can only explain it to you but not understand it for you.
---
If you see it differently then that is fine but we can keep this up all week with you telling me that it isn't a problem and me telling you it could be and run in circles which I not really have the motivation to do so.
---
Ok cool. Thanks again for the help! :D
---
This event, unfortunately, bugs constantly.  Probably about half the time I go to Vabbi to do the heart I notice this event is bugged.
---
Dammit ... just got my skyscale and would have liked the title :(
---
One hopes they'll bring it back and maybe retrospectively reward those that have done whichever rifts.
---
I think a cool idea ESO has is fishing spots. Although mobs might make that an issue.
---
In pve ._.
---
Some people are new. Instead of sarcastic remarks maybe we should give them advice.
---
Yeah I do wish there was an ability to have templates (and also to be able to customize key bindings to each template-the layout I use for one class or specialization may not be as good for a different class or specialization).
---
But I think it's also just that huge aspects of play style have to be abandoned in meta builds, which is just kind of disappointing. Honestly I wish there was a viable base class meta build for each class that showcased the class's unique potential, and then the specializations would just allow you to branch into different niches if you wanted to. E.g., you should be able to have a meta base ranger ranged pet class, and then have meta druid and soulbeast builds for different play styles (heal instead of dps, or melee dps instead of ranged dps). Then change or add boss mechanics to make each one more or less viable for the situation, and balance so that you're not completely f'd if you don't like one of the options. Instead I feel like they make it so that pet base ranger is practically useless after a point, so that you have to play melee or heal to play longer with the class. I feel like if they did the former, you'd still have incentive to buy expansions, but you wouldn't have to use the new builds if you didn't want to.
---
Posting because we used to like the game; have friends, guilds and memories linked to it. Yet we're sad about the direction it has gone that makes it essentially unfun to play. So we voice our concerns while playing other games. Makes sense to me. 
---
Why reply to posts you don't like without arguments other than "go do another game if you aren't amazed by this one" when that's already adressed in OP's main post? Wouldn't it be simpler to contribute to the thread rather than repeatedly say "if you don't like the current state of the game you should gtfo and do something else rather than expressing it!"
---
Good ol' CoLlEcTiOnZ, wasting peoples time since 2016.
---
How can I bypass this bugged phase? Do I have to wait until a new map opens up during peak time or something?
---
This game is easy. Now go raid without a proper build or rotation or knowing mechanics and tell me how it goes.
---
Fully agree this is what GW2 did well. This is also why to me - the mastery system was meaningless all together. Both in PvE and in WvW. It doesn't actually provide ANY horizontal progression at all. It just adds a tiny "grind" similar to an increase in level cap / item level / soft cap / ... from every other mmorpg; which keeps you grinding until you cap out and leaves you with no meaningful progression or choices after.
---
And complaining about the game does even less. So you move on first and then I will. Problem solved!
---
Yeah, the guy brings up all the relevent issues: the "Hey boss!" issue along with having to pay for the LS chapters.
---
I do appreciate his idea of a self contained story.
---
Personally, I would prefer GW3 with a fresh start since even with the fixes to the story, I am bored of it.
---
Again when have I ever said that I wouldn't look up the proper mechanics before doing it?
---
You try raiding in any mmo without doing mechanics you'll die, that's not a gw2 only thing
---
The story instances can be about the story without being totally trivial for anyone with exotic gear. Again, if you’re ONLY interested in the story and not the gameplay, we have books and movies for that. However much I enjoy the story, I’m playing the game so I can play the game, not read dialogue and watch cutscenes.
---
Echoing frustration with this. I wish there was an easier way to spawn a new Map IP. We've been trying a lot of different tactics, and it's just not working out.
---
if you have a nvidia graphics card you could enable Shadowplay for the next time.
---
costs no performance. you can record up to the last 30min that happened. 
---
so youll never miss a good moment again.
---
Change my mind : Collections are GW2's take on mindless "fetch" type quests they tried to get rid off on game release. People that pretend they're content should go back to any other MMORPG. There's plenty of fetch to do there.
---
&gt; I HATED the enrage timer the when the first wing came out
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I knew what direction the game was taking - and bummer us, it came true
---
&gt; It was a DPS quickly or die format in GW2 and this chokes the variety of builds in raids
---
This is the exact opposite of the point this thread is making. And I feel like you're clueless about the raid meta, tbh. I'm not sure what role or sort of build you are hoping to play but there is plenty of variety. Enrage timer has nothing to do with why people want high damaging builds in the DPS slot, the fact that bosses die when their HP hits zero is why people want high DPS builds. Even without an enrage timer people would STILL prefer high dps builds.
---
Ranger using pistols. My dream. Bow Engineer.
---
Those other people : actually discussing the state of the game and the post of OP.
---
You : Refusing to discuss anything related to the thread other than telling people whose opinion you dislike to fuck off because it isn't rainbows and sunshine, while refusing to argue what / why is rainbows and sunshine, despite this attitude specifically being adressed in OPs thread.
---
I know the game is very CPU heavy but does / has anyone ran it on a RX590?
---
Play arc divider and rp as the manic barbarian swinging a giant broadsword over his head in circles and yelling the whole time
---
Every time I see TINY, which is every day, I'm tempted to Asura-fy to join what looks like the most fun peeps.
---
My hangup is the story - how hard is it to take an Asuran commander seriously on a scale of easy to must-suspend-disbelief?   Some of the earlier beats are hard enough to take seriously on a generic human.
---
&gt;Those other people : actually discussing the state of the game neither they nor the OP play anymore.
---
FTFY
---
And I guess you missed my point entirely. So I will repeat it: there is absolutely no reason for someone who not longer enjoys the game to play it, comment about it, or even be on this subreddit. They should find a game they do enjoy and talk about that.
---
Do you understand now?
---
I feel like if this was a thing, it wouldn’t increase diversity, just allow people to min/max more. Veteran players would just figure out the optimal stat spread for each build and then new players would find the spread on snowcrows.
---
Maybe they were working on getting the mastery points and by the time they got the amount needed, the bar was already full. Considering that masteries are really easy to level up (specially the first ones), didn't you even think about that?
---
Horny Santa?!?!??!
---
Ah, sorry. Skimmed too quickly
---
It’s free. Download it and try it for yourself. Just keep in mind that the leveling experience 1-80 is effectively an extended trial, the real game begins once you hit 80 and get the expansions. Use the leveling experience to find out if you like the combat mechanics, which are some of the best of any game out there. Enjoy!
---
But you still need to click on train.
---
Car stealership o_O sounds fun
---
The alternative is subscription, which would immediately nuke the game to death at this stage
---
Fri early evening or Sat latish afternoon I always see one running.  Everything else is sporadic.
---
Just for fun ;)
---
I just started my hiatus from the game after 2 years of active play and you summarized nearly all the reasons why I am stopping. 
---
The game doesnt feel meaningful. For a while, crafted legendaries I always wanted was great but not nearly as satisfying as I wanted. 
---
And for being a game of playing how ever you want, it feels limited in making fun builds. 
---
I was really hoping for some pve content where you choices makes an influence in some map instance or events so the game feels alive. Verdant Brink Meta, Silver Waste, and Dragonfall are great examples. 
---
But I think I really am burnt out of the game entirely and see no reason to come back unless they do something new or innovative.
---
So I used one of my Jubilant Dye Kits on Shadow Abyss Dye a couple of years ago. I now see that this same dye goes for upwards of 200 gold at the trading post. If I opt to get another Shadow Dye Kit, can I get the Shadow Abyss Dye and sell it, or will it not let me since I already have it on my account?
---
Weaver was 10/10 meme, great job
---
&gt; it's like everyone just stops and stares at me.
---
does the same thing happen in pve in this case?  when I seen "everyone" I was reading it as actual enemy players..
---
&gt; stow 
---
It needs to be stow or a simple swap would do?
---
Nah, the game is just not optimized well, and it's on DX9. You could try using D912pxy for some performance improvements though
---
but griffon does impact on your performance, wtf.
---
your argument isn't that having to pay 60g is problematic, but that it's "so unfair that other ppl got it for free earlier!". seriously. what's wrong with that. are ppl saying its problematic cuz they need to buy kourna episode to unlock beetle to participate in the racing? i mean if there's actual content gatekeeping, it's that. and yet nobody gives a shit, because its no big deal to get the episode and unlock the mount. please stop your nonsense.
---
and if you can't come up with the 60 gold to unlock the spec then yes you are at disadvantage, but it's not the episode price problem, it's your problem for not being able to afford it. but dont worry, 60g takes 1-2 days to get. jesus christ. you're a troll. and i got baited. rip me
---
Depends if it's account bound or not. It doesn't matter if you own it.
---
i have exactly zero hours of play time so im mostly looking for a suggestion. What healers/supports are good in raids at the moment and can healers solo through quests?
---
Just because "nobody gives a shit" doesn't mean it isn't problematic.
---
At its core the idea of never having to upgrade your gear is great, you have an ultimate goal, and once you're there, you're at peak capacity. But as someone who has like 22 characters decked out in full ascended, you can see how that ideal doesn't really pan out for long term. There's no progression, and while I don't really care for having to redo my gear in every expansion of say WoW or FFXIV, I've just got nothing to improve save for when meta shifts and I have to drop a bunch of ectos gold to swap stats.
---
When I talk to my friends about Gw2 I always tell them how much I love the game, and that it's my favorite MMO. But then they ask me "How come you don't really play it anymore then?"
---
Simple answer: I beat the game. Got 7k hours out of playing it, and I won. I got the legendaries I wanted. I beat the raids I wanted, I geared up to my heart's content and I just can safely say that I've beat it. And that's fine! I'll remember it as the game I love, instead of like Wow where it WAS great but they kept trying to reinvent the wheel until it became this jagged square going down a rocky hill.
---
It's the kind of thing that makes me wish that a Gw3 would come out, like how we used to play games on consoles. Pour 4k hours into crouch jumping up that one mountain in Halo, while waiting in anticipation for the next release. Living stories are great but they're not a whole new game, just a little DLC that hooks me till I squeeze out all the story I can. I love those DLC, but I want more damn it! I ache for a new adventure where I can slam thousands of hours down into building up my hero again.
---
Also in the little comparisons I've felt of late.. gw2 is a game I've always looked forward for story, and cool shite that would just drop out of nowhere in new patches. I look forward to what's new in gw2's patches, in most other games I look forward to what's 'fixed' which really says something to me. I like that feeling, not pulling my hair out cause of balance or stupid systems that are just a endless grind.
---
Still annoys me to no end that they basically locked the Coalescence in raids. What's the point in that? Collective effect is cool and all, and I can forgive them for having a tiered effect instead of individual effect, but locking it in raid is just dumb. Not to mention that it's harder to get than a full legendary armor set. For a ring? (a full ascended armor set still costs a lot, compared to a ring which is basic) Give me a break Anet.
---
Elaborate, tell me exactly when and how majority of content updates were not about adding new content in the open world, i gave a bunch of examples, now it's your turn.  
---
I feel like this whole thread is filled with retarded dumbasses who can't distinguish between the game's direction and developer's plans for development, because yeah, developers changed their plans multiple times, first they wanted to keep the living world, then decided to go with an expansion, they said that there will be no raids, then they added raids, but all of that was done while keeping focus on the game's massive open world content and it's story.
---
I quit last December for the same reason. I check in on various sites from time to time to see if there's a reason to come back. The game gets so much right but tying literally 99% of decent looking cosmetics and all QoL upgrades to gems is a real kick in the motivation to keep playing.
---
I never quit, I been playing since launch
---
I have been playing mmorpg's for about 20 years now and I haven't come across a paladin wielding a longbow. Hell a guardian doesn't even use arcane magic, holy or light sure but arcane? That thing the ele's use? Nah.
---
I don't have any other beef with the game - I expected to pay for the content, I enjoy the content, I enjoy the game.  But LWS1 is fingernails on the chalkboard, I'll never be okay with it.  I shouldn't still be frustrated with it.
---
I came back after five years, bought the expansions and the LW episodes so I wouldn't miss any of the story.  I was pretty frustrated that the drop into LWS2 was so jarring.  The summary vid didn't cut it.  These randos think I'm their best friend, dropping all kinds of in-jokes, calling me boss.  I have never met you before.  What the what?
---
I got over it, but it took a few episodes of interacting with them before I didn't get a bad taste whenever there was interaction.  It's not how a game is supposed to make you feel about story;  I shouldn't have to explain or apologize for the game before I recommend it to a friend, but all my friends are story nerds and I know how they'll react.
---
All that to say that unless they can do it as a side project or additional dev without slipping on current dev, I get it - it's not worth it.  I think it would have been worth it to do it prior to LWS2 or immediately after the events ended.
---
I still think they could get away with it if the dialog of the first S2 ep was tweaked.  "Remember when this?"  "Remember when that?"   It'd purely be a sop, but at least it'd relieve some of the frustration with being expected to know what's happening instead of straight up asking us to just accept the unacceptable.
---
Is there an easy way to swap between a healer spec and a dmg spec? Or would that be a character swap thing?
---
Yes I agree it is too underpowered. I think it needs 1500+ range + unblock able and at least 10 seconds Stealth
---
It's a massively multi-player online cosmetics shop! MMOCS
---
What is the ACTUAL difference between an xpac and a LW with elite specs rolled in ? The name and the fact they charge u $50. Name another difference.
---
Well simply look at raids or why do you think that most of the playerbase is just ignoring it?  There you have challenging and rewarding content, but still most of the people dont play it.
---
I'm not sure if you ever did f2p from zero to 150 ar/100cm, and compared it to same of paid, but you are wrong. No amount of down-votes will prove you right.
---
The big issue GW1 had (and still has) was that it had too many skills and too many similar skills at that. Even me, who GW1 and 2 since their launches, get's overwhelmed trying to create my build of 8 skills from hundreds of skills in GW1. It's too overwhelming and I can't imaging (as a software dev myself) the nightmares involved with trying to balance 1000 skills against each other AND in their respective combinations. The GW2 system I feel helped this a lot.
---
I personally don't like the way GW2 handles Runes/Sigils. I think they need to go away and instead have something like set unlocks that you can unlock on a char/account and you can just select it. Same with Questing, the Dynamic Events are great IMO, but it'd be nice to have some smaller-story focused quest lines (that you can repeat per character or class) that do things like give background to a class/spec and progressively unlock class/spec specific rune/sigil combinations as you go through the quest line. Runes/Sigils are the main reason I rarely change builds. Switching out weapons/armor is pretty simple, but Runes/Sigils are a PITA
---
The tricky part in all of this is that the more choice players are given (and more choice they want to give us) actually limits what they can do. The broader the target audience and more freedom given to players means having a less clear direction.
---
The abandonment of class roles is something that hurt GW2, I think. Healer and Tank should've been kept, along with adding a Support (buff), Support (debuff) roles would've been nice (and make everybody share the DPS role).
---
It's not terrible. Takes about a minute once you've memorized the skills/traits/gear. There's no in-game build template function but at least there's 3rd party add-on to help with build templates.   
---
Some people do have multiple characters of the same class so they can swap builds really quick, but it's only really worth it if you swap classes a lot or just have a lot of spare resources.
---
im member of minority, i know just because nobody cares doesnt mean something isnt problematic. except in those cases, its just majority that doesnt give a shit. some group is opressed. in this case (everyone treated equal - get for free or pay a bit later) is not opressing anyone, everything is fair.
---
While I agree that it's a lot of work, I'm frankly not too sure what else it could mean. We already get new masteries, maps and even mounts through living story. Maybe guild halls or something..? Doesn't really seem worth the tease though.
---
Because enrage timers are a race against the clock, I think it a fairly easy concept to understand - that if you reach enrage timer, your squad isnt doing enough damage. And these enrage timers are different, its because Anet WANTS you to pump out a set amount of damage within a period of time.
---
This isnt the exact opposite of what this tread is about - this is pushing maximum damage builds out.
---
You have a tank using boon share - surprise, its a chronomancer
---
You have DPS - you're either running berzerkers, viper and grieving 
---
Healer? Druid - get harrier 
---
Do you know how many different stat set there are? 51. FIFTY ONE. Its like giving someone a path to walk down except it leads you off a cliff - its a **false sense of variation,** THAT is why its relevant 
---
If you're going to say "well there are some slightly different builds you can use", save it, it still doesnt even come close
---
If a boss is always as simple as just DPS the boss down instead of also using mechanics to do the damage, or to survive for a period of time, or w.e, then you've just pointed out another problem. Variation in raid bosses.
---
This is an even more widespread problem in PVE - run zerkers. Go ahead and tell me this part isnt true.
---
If some noob  ask what build they should run in map chat, what would you say ? Zerkers.
---
Great job dude!
---
Those are fair points. When I used to ride the HPTrains, I would always send the conductor some gold. I know it's not much, but it's a way to show appreciation.
---
&gt; but then they start chatting about things that aren't in the summaries of S1.
---
To be fair, S1 was six years ago, so for those of us who were there, there's a lot we don't remember.
---
They don't have to copy and paste from mmos theres other type of fantasy RPG. In games like DnD and Pathfinder they exist. Also, sure in the GW universe what is considered arcane is different. In any typical setting arcane just means magic. I'd argue the guardian is more of a Mage Knight than a Paladin. Sense holy doesn't exist anymore when the made GW2.
---
You can say that about soulbeast too. Why would you attack anyone who's behind a wall or a tree? You can also bait dodges with autoattacks which can also hit for 8-10k with sick em (which lasts 10 seconds). Dodge also lasts for 0.75 seconds so both dodges are still not enough to evade full rapid fire.
---
No burst should be as high as soulbeast's nor as easily accessible.
---
Same
---
Depends on the skill, in revenant's case with Glint/Shiro elite, a stow works.
---
When a stow works, you should choose that over weapon swap obviously - don't wanna put yourself on weapon swap cd for literally no reason.
---
GGG Only releases content every 3 months, and every now and then the release is a huge failure with the fan base (Beastiary and Synthesis) and everybody leaves early, putting them at 6 months release sometimes.
---
PoE also doesn't add that many new assets or voice acting as GW2 has to. Not to mention PoE depends a lot on the leveling experience with each release as "content". Imagine GW2 forcing you to create a new character with every living story release.
---
DE also suffers from the same content drought issues. Prior to the The Jovian Concord (may 2019), the most recent content release was Fortuna (nov 2018), prior to that The Sacrafice (jun 2018) and the one before that was Plains of Eidolon in (oct 2017)
---
That puts DE at 2 releases per year, and GGG at sometimes 4 releases a year.
---
In 2018 Anet released: A Bug in the System (March), Long Live the Lich (June), and A Star to Guide Us. With All or Nothing on January 8th, just a week into the new year.
---
Not only does Anet have a larger, more complex game than both DE and GGG, but every release they do needs to bring with it more animations, more textures, more voice acting, and still keep the quality despite losing 66% of their team in the layoffs.
---
&gt; The fight between the dwarves and the Destroyers consumed the dwarven army sent to fight the Great Destroyer. Few returned to the surface to tell the tale of their victory—and those who did had been transformed into stone with altered mentality. During this time, the remaining Stone Summit rejoined what remained of Deldrimor, and the two communities lived together in peace once more.

Have you tried forcibly enabling VSync for GW2 from nVidia Control Panel? If you're going to do it, prefer to set it to "Fast", as it will also eliminate tearing but at no cost to in-game frametimes.
---
If you have a monitor that supports G-Sync/FreeSync (which is likely, since you said you're using 144hz monior), are you sure its enabled and works properly?
---
What you're describing is odd. You say disabling VSync causes more lags for you, which is exactly the opposite of what it should do. Enabling VSync *should* cause input lag but *fix* screen tearing, that's what it exists for - creating artificial delays in order to deliver the entire frame when the monitor fully finished displaying the previous one.
---
Couldn't agree more. Hot masteries are real lengthy content that's satisfying to complete, not to mention they make xp relevant, making anything that gives xp relevant as a result. 
---
All the masteries since then I've completed in a couple hours of playing the game, and that's without grinding for xp. It's completely unsatisfying.
---
Masteries have ironically become vertical progression for vets at this point because you are getting one mastery or mastery tree every 3-4 months. There aren't multiple paths to decide between. You just do the newest thing and it will be completed long before the next one comes into the game.
---
The amount of things you can get stuck in or trip on during this adventure, I swear...

---
Not sure why the bot picked that comment. Looks like I accidentally grabbed the #latest in the url, is that why?
---
Ah yes I remember, that's why I didn't do this years ago lol.
---
Also personal housing.
---
&gt;  That means that the "in the middle" approach will not satisfy most people 
---
A bimodal distribution could very well be picked up by a standard bell curve / median approach but this is a negligible point since there is no data suggesting that players are within an extremely polarised bimodal distribution to begin with. Catering to one extreme will always exclude more people either way.
---
&gt; The Skyscale collection took probably 20 hours to get through, including farming the currencies from scratch. That was enough to make the majority of the community lose their goddamn minds. They're not going to make masteries harder. 
---
The Skyscale collection has nothing to do with masteries because it is a collection, not a mastery. The collection itself took a while, the masteries a matter of an hour at absolute most for the experience and, if you play the game regularly and do maps casually, no time at all for the mastery points as these are given away. That is the issue that people are raising with the mastery system - it is over far too quickly to actually matter and is completed in a linear manner, unlike with HoT.
---
&gt; I don't think making the mastery progression part longer is going to increase retention at all, I really don't. That's just not what this game is about. It's not good at it at all, so anyone who cares about that sort of thing is going to go elsewhere anyway. Why try to chase an audience that isn't your core audience? 
---
If you could substantiate this more than a feeling, that would be great. Longer time to complete for masteries gets players out and playing the content - it means more participation in world events to get that experience up, another reason to do weekly raid clears, it encourages people to do things they wouldn't normally do (HoT adventures and achievements being a prime example) and gives a sense of progression that you don't get through gear or runes or sigils. Remove those extra goals and adventures are less played, there is less people out and about in the world and groups for achievements such as Migraine have less of a driving pull to complete them. I'm not sure why you think the core audience doesn't want a meaningful mastery system. Going by the number of people sitting at 295, they certainly do. And if the masteries are tuned correctly and don't block essential gameplay, then they become a nicety to work towards. That is all.
---
&gt; Dull for you, maybe. I'm not bored, and I'm sitting pretty at 295. 
---
To be as dismissive as you were in your original reply,  that's your opinion, and it's fine that you feel that way. Going by the sheer number of responses in this thread, it isn't an opinion everyone shares with you.
---
&gt; Also, seriously, do some fractals or just walk around in the LS maps. 295 is a minority. Hell, a lot of people aren't even at 200. I think you dramatically overestimate the number of people who complete masteries instantly and then have nothing to look forward to. 
---
This is anecdotal so pointless but whatever. A quick scout of the Mistlock Sanctuary gives me a majority of 295, some 283, a 225 and one person with 219. That was the lowest. Aerodrome was more 295s, a couple of people around 180. I think you dramatically underestimate the number of people who complete masteries (*it doesn't even need to be instantly!*) and then have no further masteries to look forward to.
---
this a million times. are the whales all super casuals who only log in to look at their own characters? no! they play just like us i say do it for the game and the ones making it possible.
---
I think they’re gonna do whatever makes them money.
---
only in the case of season 1
---
I just started the game recently and actually feel like there is SO much to do, see, explore, acquire, learn that it's overwhelming. (To be fair, coming into any MMO after 5+ years of being live would feel that way to me.) I was convinced that GW2 "wasn't for me" but I was wrong. It's filled the gap that was left when Neverwinter Mod16 nerfed everything to high heaven.
---
Fake news! I too lazy to do this....thank you mate for your hardwork!
---
lol its more like lolrd vanquish is cosplaying OP and even looking in his direction for approval
---
Don't forget Flamethrower 3 . .
---
what do have i to buy to skip Seventh Astral Era MSQ?
---
srsly that is the worst thing i ever played in a MMO.
---
Do i have to buy "Tales of Adventure: A Realm Reborn"?
---
i already started the quest chain, about 20 quest into it.
---
the quest mentioned in the shop is somehow not a quest but the title gain for the last quest.
---
so it should do it when i buy this service from the shop?
---
Which is odd because when I tried GW2 originally, I felt it demanded more of my time more regularly than WoW to keep up with the LS1 developments while attempting dungeons and gearing to the extent that I went back to MoP. I only picked GW2 up again in 2015 because I didn't want to pay for a subscription when I was writing my thesis and moving about for jobs. Even then, it took me months of nightly play to do world completion, get caught up with LS2 and a good chunk of time to get ascended gear. I enjoyed that period of the game because things took time to do and I could do them at my own pace, unlike with LS1. However, nothing felt quick or over too soon. That feeling only started to become apparent with things being made easier to acquire in LS3 and the copious amounts of ascended items being thrown at players for raiding and completing fractals. There hasn't been anything that I've sat down and planned out how to progress and complete since the release of LS3, bar following lists for legendaries and Dhuum (CM) taking commitment.
---
If Anet want to take things down the road of handing everything out on a silver platter in exchange for a couple of hours of time every few months, that is their call to make. But it isn't going to keep people engrossed or engaged. Doing the same thing over and over again for years does get stale eventually.
---
You are inconsistent. First you say that leveling is slower (it's not) then something about gifting bags and suddenly you speak about fractals t4.
---
ffxiv has the advantage of being able to play any class on one character tho- if i get bored of my main i can switch with one button push. in gw2 i gotta at least relog- if I have that character geared and levelled at all.
---
Really not liking the change to ancestral grace in pve. The evade was a way for druid to cover ground through some AoE and heal others flexibly. I could care less about the cool down reduction for using it on an ally. Ranger uses a lot of evades as part of their weapon skills and identity with mobility, this change feels like a step back.
---
Thieves get portal, Chronos don't have F5 anymore.
---
You should try falling underneath the map and then swimming downwards. It will take you about 20 minutes to reach the bottom, I took a picture of it over a year ago but you are so far away that the range from one of the waypoints closest to the ground is ~300,000. For some reason the map boundary is just weird for Hoelbrak. Also, after a certain depth your entire screen turns black and you can't even see your character.
---
&gt;Theif
---
&gt;Shadow Portal
---
Oh my.  Get ready for quicker Portal Bombs in WvW.
---
"Finished" As in a stopping point! I'm working on my speed with my drawings and doing dynamic angles, so this is my usual finishing-practice point. I may color it later, it turns out really comic-book-y.
---
&gt; It blows my mind that someone at ArenaNet said out loud, “Hey, we should do a bunch of important storytelling in temporary open world events that no one will ever be able to see again,” and then whoever was above that person greenlit the idea
---
IMO, this kinda sums up a lot of GW2's development, especially early on. I actually liked S1's focus on grandiose open-world content that would result in lasting changes, but the decision to make *everything* temporary was baffling at the time, and it only gets more puzzling with time.  There was a decent part of S1 that was instanced, too: the Nolan Hatchery and Cragstead missions, for example. Why did that have to go away?  They often compared the Living Story to a TV show, back in the day, but TV shows will have reruns, video releases, and now streaming; watching it live has it's benefits, but people can always go back and see shows they might have missed.  The fact that ArenaNet didn't realize that is truly incredible. 
---
On the author's broader point, I do see it as an issue, but one that I don't think Anet can really rectify at this point. The story being continuous and interconnected is a feature, as much as it is a potential stumbling block. I'm also of the opinion that Living Story should just be free with its associated expansion (which would make LS2 free for everyone) or, at the very least, give players the ability to bundle it with an expansion purchase for a decent discount. I do like the idea of making a quick in-game recap cinematic for each expansion to quickly establish context for players; I think that could potentially go a long way.  An in-game codex would be nice too.
---
Thief Portal
---
Personally I'd say being a kiter is the easiest way. There'll always be a green next to you when the mechanic happens, making hard for you to miss.
---
You can also ask people to babysit you, but I wouldn't rely on pugs honestly.
---
Honestly I didn't read through the entire post because I've already listened to the 3h TeaTime linked at the top, and it looks like you've merely provided a TL;DW. I couldn't agree more with the concerns raised in the video. You know shit's not good when the biggest community names are ranting like that. Anet needs to gather everyone and listen to it, it's the sincerest and most exhaustive feedback piece to date.
---
When I started reading these i inconspicuous trait changes for elementalist, I knew that there is a nerf hidden somewhere. And yes, not more +10% damage in fire. Rip. They finally finished class off.
---
Wrong game. This is GW2, not FFXIV.
---
oh fu :-) sorry :-)
---
&gt;Continuum Shift: This skill now replaces distortion in the F4 slot instead of taking the F5 slot.
---
... Ok fine, i submit to this bullying. No more chrono for me.
---
Satan Claws
---
To play devil's advocate, what MMO's pvp *isn't* a joke? AFAIK essentially every single one is trash for it, but I think the earlier days of BnS (like first year) had pretty fun pvp. It started to go to shit for me after warlock was released because it made me realise how retardedly broken air lifts were.
---
Oh god
---
Can't wait to learn how to play chronomancer AGAIN
---
To clarify, chrono's f4 is being replaced by their previous f5. Also, no more shattering without clones.
---
No more immortal scrappers
---
How is it easier to CS? Still processing the changes.
---
we totally are the most fun of peeps =D
---
How much do the notes say you get for one clone? And how much is it now?
---
thank god they nerf reaper everyone was a bit concerned it might actually be in a good spot
---
the sustain was indeed to strong which is why reaper is meta in every single game mode and that simply can't do!
---
jokes aside this trade-off bullshit has to stop..tweak the numbers but stop adding idiotic stuff like the swipe change which literally nobody ever anywhere said it's good(except braindamaged anet balance people)
---
They better not take away my Mallyx Avatar for a boring ass dark field...
---
It's like you completely skipped lines about shatters being reworked or something.
---
What exactly is there to re-learn? F5 and F4 get rolled into one, that's pretty much it. Frankly for PvE support chrono this whole patch will barely change anything.
---
I don't even know what I'm reading in the Revenant change tea leaves.
---
easier to press f4 than pressing f5 :c
---
Hrnm they finally reworked thief traps.. let's see
---
Can you please stop "adjusting" guardian.This is the 3rd patch in a roll they nerf something.
---
No changes to the shitty nerfed Necromanced OHs.
---
See you in 4 months.
---
and in PvP, this reverts it back to "4 people need to peel for me, or i'm a punching bag"
---
How is using the same four shatters core mesmer gets different?
---
HoT trains still happen pretty much daily.
---
STILL ZERO PvE MIRAGE NERFS.  Why does Anet refuse to nerf this ridiculously OP build!? I mean you can do 35k DPS on Cairn, over 45k if you look at personal stats.  You get 20% higher DPS than any other condi class on about 6-7 bosses yet they refuse to nerf it.  They really are completely clueless.  They likely just look at SC benchmark numbers and see 28k and think it's OK.  This team is completely and utterly useless.
---
Nah, he is right, it is going to be the same. Right now you get 3s with one clone (1.5 from clone, 1.5 from self) and after patch you can getting 3s from the first clone and nothing from self. 
---
So CS pretty much moved to f4 and distortion deleted, pve-wise.
---
*YOU get a nerf! And YOU get a nerf! EVERYONE gets a nerf!*
---
Currently it's a base of 1.5 seconds with +1.5 second per clone. 
---
Change log says it now requires one clone to cast and is 3/4.5/6... I don't think that's a change in duration.
---
RIP timewarp CS before dhuum ritual and qadim lamp 1
---
It is completely different now.
---
Nevermind, I thought they were changing the duration per clone, they were just adjusting it because you can’t shatter it with no clones.
---
Well props to you bud, drawing looks awesome!!!
---
Daredevil has 3 dodges... Herald has a f2... Scrapper has a range revive/stomp...  Holo has photon mode... Tempest has overload... Mirage has ambush... Revenant has all the kalla skills... These are all straight upgrades on the base class and not just remixes.
---
It's a shame that Chronomancer is essentially the Ryze of GW2, but I can at least admire that they're seemingly putting in more effort to balance/rework during these periods between balance patches compared to before. Not a fan of all the changes, but looking forward to trying them out all the same.
---
Bro.. it’s talking about mimic
---
10% increased damage to burning foes is the replacement, which when paired with any class that outputs burns of some sort should be a 10% damage across the board vs only when in fire.
---
The visuals are too obstructive, you only get the effects of a dark field but no visuals because reasons. Also we hate auras.
---
The mists are strange. It encompasses the past, present, and future of all history in guild wars lore. Revenant legends channel echoes, and thus the spirits of these legends no longer need to exist. Take mallyx for example, an Abaddon servant we completely obliterated in gw2. He no longer exists in any form, yet we can channel him anyways as a revenant. Only, we channel an echo of him, similar to fractals, if that makes sense. 
---
Due to this, channeling Balthazar would be lore friendly, and even spoiler free, as we would most likely channel a more Noble echo of him - granted, like shiro, he would most likely be aware we killed him, or that he no longer exists.
---
Well obviously good players in pvp will stop attacking you when you use FC, the meme is that (often) mobs will spam attacks from every side and then when you use FC, all 20 of them stare at you until the cast is done.
---
I'm not seeing anything in the Preparations that says you HAVE to have an enemy in the not-Trap AoE to trigger them.  So no reason you can't just portal people in even if no enemies are around.
---
I'd argue about that and say they'll change some traits and are even worse than before, but we'll see.
---
Headbutt is a bunny skill, hah
---
(The title is a big **/s**.)
---
As an Ele, I really like the mechanical changes, foregoing the reduced recharge always felt just bad. But just by reading the patch notes, I feel like weaver DPS will actually be affected negatively, despite the Swift Revenge buff. There is a straight up 10% damage loss in fire (unless I'm missing something) and further ferocity loss in air. The reworked Burning Rage probably won't make up for the 10% damage loss, though that will need benchmarking of course. I was kinda hoping for direct dps buffs for Ele, not gonna. lie. Our DPS is pretty avarage now, yet our rotation is one of the hardest and survivibility pretty much the lowest. Playing the class feels pretty unrewarding now, but at least the gameplay is engaging.
---
I also hope that conjured weapons will be reworked at some point, mechanically. It's one of the Ele quirks that feels just awkward. Picking up items between all that mess that happens during bossfights is straight up painful and the pickup/drop animation feels clunky. I'd really like to see more fluency to the system, even if it came at the cost of the additional copy.
---
Thief dagger storm is getting ANOTHER duration nerf!?! It is going to feel like a standard utility skill,but with an elite cooldown at this rate. The short duration it currently has is too short to begin with,let alone reducing it by another 30%!
---
When I play story mode, I expect dialogue and cutscenes so I can understand the story ALONG WITH decent fights so I can actually play the game. Story mode shouldn’t be a movie.
---
Do you have a picture of your ingame character? Looks amazing!
---
More like they are getting F4 and F5 merged.
---
Well, it is more than little awkward, new trait gives 180 condi damage and the old one gives just a little bit more assuming typical pve gear. 
---
But I doubt that they are going to replace it with relevant power trait, because they already partially "compensated" 10% loss in weaver (nerf core, buff elite spec, nice idea) and just straight buff to power ele likely wasn't in their plans.
---
No worries. Still working through the changes myself
---
&gt; Speed of Sand: Instead of granting superspeed when dodging, this trait instead causes Mirage Cloak to grant +66% movement speed.
---
Can this just be freaking split between PvP/PvE already. It was a really fun evade and easy way to move quickly in PvE since mirage does not get the 25% movement buff and it's getting worse and worse. I get that it's OP in PvP so fine, nerf it to hell in PvP and give us the fun PvE one back.
---
You literally said you shouldn’t have to go through a training course to learn how to raid, also try to tank Desmina with no encounter knowledge other than what you read in a guide.
---
Ah thank you for explaining this to me
---
Can't tell you how many times I've fat-fingered Distortion, trying to press Continuum Split, only to realize the mistake after blowing huge cooldowns. :(
---
If you're with a group you know, let them know you're gonna play this round greedily and go to all the small greens yourself using your special action.  
---
In a pug, just try and play correctly and pay attention to where others are going.  
---
I'm not too sure there's an easiest class. Whatever you're best at so you can pay attention to mechanics rather than your own skills.
---
+10% ito burning is already there, in the very same minor gm slot. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Burning_Rage
---
Oh, yeah, ok that's not too good then
---
Thanks!
---
Cough thief nerfs every patch btw cough
---
It’s also just a plain amazing game on its own too I’ll add, as a longtime player of GW I feel they are both worth playing :)
---
&gt; people who don't map break seem to think  every conceivable spot that  has an invisible wall touching it from any  direction must automatically  be a spot from which standing would crash  your game 
---
That's a first ever hearing that for me...  
---
Maybe it's just cause parts behind those walls are not 'important' so there's no need to be there or it's a preventative measure. 
---
Not everywhere has to be accessible to get to.  And who's to say all that you see is indeed fully rendered?
---
&gt;Hey, thanks for making it so necro can’t heal in shroud while not providing any way to be healed in shroud. PvE necros really thank you guys.
---
This is a good thing. Using Shroud should be a tradeoff. Reaper Shroud is ridiculously OP in both PvE and PvP.
---
Also, you still have life steal if using Blood Magic.
---
&gt;This used to even be a common reason fractal CM groups didn’t like taking necros.
---
Absolutely not.
---
The reason people didn't take Reapers for CM groups is because they were perceived as being low DPS.
---
The Function Gyro change with the increasing cooldown sounds like complete dogshit.
---
And if it occupies the f5 slot now, what happens to the toolbelt ability for your elite skill? No more Reveal?
---
No thanks to *Kormir*.
---
Axe/axe is so much better, but I'll be damned if I stop using the greatsword. Arc Divider is just so damn fun.
---
Yeah that’s what’s my first thought when I saw that.
---
preparations\*
---
My opinion is to make the condi BS. Obviously, people are correct in saying having more options is better eventually. But condi BS means you can do a full clear of every boss in the same role, which is important for group consistency in case no one can swap with you for a boss.
---
argh, will fix.
---
&gt; because we don't play ~~PvP~~ the game at all.
---
FTFY.
---
&gt;  but distortion is effectively removed.
---
\*Laughs in Firebrigade.\*
---
Suck it, Chronomancer scum!!!
---
This is a bright day for FB/Renegades to sip wine.
---
Assuming the target is always burning, I think this means a 10% damage increase on all elements compared to a 10% damage increase on fire only.  I think this is potentially a buff, but only if the target is always burning.
---
And if they implemented this nothing would change. 4 best in slot stat sets rule gear only difference is that they are now more efficient. It wouldn't change diversity like you think.
---
She did fuck all. In fact we wouldn't have needed to face nightfall if it wasn't for Kormir. I'm joking of course but seriously she didn't do anything. Although I did keep dancing when I fought Abaddon so I did very little as well.
---
Yeah I get what you're saying I was exaggerating a bit. But they should make the fights more interesting and not put them in so they can prolong the instance. Because sometimes it really seems they're making story around the fights. Especially when you're talking about 1-80 story or earlier lw episodes.
---
But I can relate to the OP to some extent. I've been able to really get into gw2. There was some time that I played it a lot but it didn't last that long. Now I'm only logging on for new releases so I can play through them, but am mostly waiting for a new mmo to really blow me away.
---
well 30k hp + 20k shroud reaper with 100% crit is just to strong with non stop heal.
---
now you can just solo everything if you have some skill
---
&gt;To top it off, it’s not like anyone is complaining about necro tank in PvE as nobody is even using them. For that
---
Yeah, nobody does that. I definitely don't. Nope. No way I'm that bad at this game, no sir!
---
Joking aside I'm pretty annoyed because healing in shroud was a rather important part of me almost never dying so losing it is a pretty hefty blow to an already shit build.
---
at least you danced
---
What you can see and what you interact with aren't the same thing. A thing you can see and interact with is more resource intensive than the same thing that you can see but has no collision. The invisible walls are there to keep you from falling through "illusions".
---
Well he had been trapped in that prison for so long dancing seemed appropriate.
---
that salt would be righteous. imagine waiting over 2 years for an elite spec only to learn that because you are a heavy armour class and not light, you have to wait a few weeks / months (years if we go by their gen 2 legendary release "schedule") because you aren't a light armour class or you aren't a guardian
---
"a" common reason, not "the" reason. This was one of them.
---
That 10% damage to burning has always been there (in every attunement) through Burning Rage, so no boost in that regard.
---
&gt; Furthermore, we are reducing the number of shatters from 5 back down to 4
---
Oh hey ANet, **THANK YOU FOR KILLING MY MUSCLE MEMORY BUILT IN FOUR YEARS**.
---
Who have you been learning from? Adobe? Oh, the hecking heck of hecks...
---
I'm fairly certain that in the past Necros couldn't heal in shroud, and it was because of that they add the ability for healing to be applied during shroud, wasn't it? 
---
So Anet is just going back to how shroud used to work, I won't be surprised if in a future patch they add again healing during shroud.
---
Most reapers use full berserkers which does not grant 30k hp.
---
I honestly don't even care that we're losing Distortion. I care that it's being moved to the distort button instead of being left on F5. We really need per-character keybinds; I have my F5 bound to my mouse and it's way easier for me to activate specialization abilities that way. Now I can't engage Holo Mode or CA using that button without moving CS over to my class skill binds.
---
Hmm I see some nerfs for scrapper, maybe brain dead immortal scrappers wont be a thing anymore.  Immortal condi nerfs for mesmer when??
---
Nope.  Iirc lore has it that the populace rose up against zhaitan and were promptly curb stomped.   Granted I think its cause the 330s, permasin, permaele and 55s were farming.
---
Necros getting even more nerfed, guess they Will never be a respected and usefull class in this game... All i wanted was to use them in raids and fractal... (and Yes people to this Day insta kick Necros From groups)
---
potato analysis inbound
---
Probably just a typo, since it doesn't actually have a duration since it's just the "stop this" toggle
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cbzreo/upcoming_balance_notes/etjlko9/
---
Zerk and Vipers are both not necessarily optimal; Zerk has ferocity as a minor stat and precision main which can overcap crit chance on some builds. Vipers has expertise as a minor stat and is a 4 stat combination, meaning many condi builds would rather something like condi damage and expertise main, power minor because they don't have conditions on crit or whatever.
---
Beautiful!! I love your detail and style! ;o; &lt;3
---
You know you can just change it in the settings so that you can still use it with F5 right?
---
Vanilla necro DS changes are kinda meh. I get that they wanted to bring it in line but it's still not even close to competing with elite specs.
---
It's a shame because I actually enjoy vanilla DS the most but it's subpar in everyway and cooldown reductions won't change that - it needs big changes.
---
Could just be a typo. I feel like having to manually end it to get the Distortion would be really clunky, and it not being a typo implies that Continuum Split is still on F5, which would be all kinds of weird.
---
I'm glad to see some ele buffs, specially given how weak they have been for over 3 years now in PvP. 
---
The CD traits being merged into other traits is a great start. Also great to see air trait buffs, although I do think Ele's still need more to go in the form of survavility, but lets see how everything shape up, since other classes are getting changes too, maybe at the end of all, a new meta might appear and everything might be shuffled around.
---
You get 60/90 (60 when in air, 90 more in other att) more ferocity, that is 4/6% more dmg.
---
And Swift Revenge gives 3% more damage.
---
so... barely anything changes, considering you can use your signet every 13 seconds and you never needed F4 to begin with. And when exactly did you do an opener without clones? Like... Qadim I guess?
---
&gt;Character: Braham
---
I refuse
---
This is so bloody absurd, it is almost as if they are grasping at straws when it comes to balancing. We have virtually no disengage and now we can no longer heal in shroud all the while doing shroud is the only viable way to do damage? So drop out of your damage to heal back up while pinned in place and wait 12 seconds to try and get back into shroud? You people are losing your collective minds that's all I can say at this point. We rely on being a tank because our damage is piss poor to begin with and we cannot disengage in most fights in WvW and now you remove the only tool to help us get through a rotation. I give up, just bloody well give up!
---
Buffing the elite would be the perfect way to handle this. Either put the power back into the DPS spec (Weaver) or their weapon (sword). 
---
Adjusting core constantly just keeps over or undertuning all the professions builds at the same time instead of just focusing on the build that needs adjustment.
---
I feel like you must not play chrono much if you think nothing changes by needing to summon clones in order to do shatters. CC bars in every encounter are effected by this
---
I nutted so hard reading that

But once you use those skills and the ranger leaps 2500 through the reflect after dodging his own first LB2 you are still screwed. Oh also don't forget he does that in stealth. So now he behind you and the moment you realize your downed and stomped by a perma thief just standing to the side in stealth watching.
---
yep, you need to learn how to screenshot properly..
---
then train it fully
---
I JUST finished gearing up my chrono for raiding and then this happens. Man I'm just going to drop chrono and stick with firebrand for the foreseeable future.
---
But at the same time gaining distortion upon entering CS isn't really all that helpful for you since you'll be reverting back to you previous state shortly. It would still share aegis i guess. 
---
I think it probably is on Continuum Shift... meaning you can end CS early to distort.... clunky.
---
Ok but why was poison removed from Dagger training? are we not allowed to play condi thief or something?
---
I had a toaster strudel once and it was delicious I would trust this man with my life.
---
What? You want to go case by case over every single bit where we know there's collision but also invisible walls protecting it? Dude, I don't work at Anet, I can only make the same logical inferences you can. I can only guess that Anet has an intended way of getting into such a place and they don't want people bypassing it.
---
In Augery rock they don't want people going inside over the top because you're only supposed to go in during the special event. Isn't that bit obvious?
---
ofc
---
I had just come back to the game this last month and have been trying to relearn the god damn rotation and now this...I am going to be so screwed up -.-
---
yeah man, I sure don't: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AI8RzENjlc
---
If you ever F3-ed without clones before, you were doing it very wrong.
---
One of the odder changes is for me is changing to 'dynamic' bonus numbers instead of range thresholds. I thought they actually moved away from that for consistency previously?
---
Many places that do have collision were blocked off too.
---
The no more shatters without clones is some bullshit. Having that old persona trait worked into baseline made the class feel amazing.
---
Well, chrono cannot prestack with no-clone cs anymore (at the start of quadim, at dhuum 10%, in fractahahaha, chrono was dead there for a while).  So, in fact you have to *unlearn* things.
---
We hate invisible walls and this topic tends to emerge here from time to time, sadly the people who understand and care are too few.
---
Necros were never able to heal in shroud, however, that mechanic was before healers even existed. As healers became more and more relevant, not being able to heal through shroud became a bigger problem. Before Soul Eater, a healer was essentially wasting heal and a necro became the only class not able to use its class mechanic/skills to get topped off. 
---
This becomes a bigger issue as nearly all PvE builds use scholar runes--a problem, but a separate issue. Before Soul Eater, going shroud under 90 meant you would never activate the rune and youd lose lots of DPS. With the slated change, once again you will pretty much lose the scholar bonus (compared to all other classes) in shroud if you happen--cant always control HP% during which part of your rotation you have to shroud.
---
If shroud was purely a defensive thing in PvE, fine, but its not. Shroud is mostly used offensively in PvE, and this is where this change will really screw necro.
---
Yup, that's about it. I don't think that constitutes re-learning the class.
---
No, I said I shouldn't have to go to a training raid before doing a raid, reading and maybe a video on a more complex fight is more than plenty. 
---
And when did I say I was a tank in this game? Lmao
---
You've summed up my thoughts on the nerf exactly. Fuck the thought process behind the nerf.
---
you cant prestack,you lose 1 sec of invu for nothing and for fun you get F5  removed. 350 nerf for chrono,time to move the fuck out of this class.
---
If I'm doing my math correctly the new Aeromancer's Training and Raging Storm are actually a net gain to Ferocity (Before: +420 Ferocity while attuned to Air with Fury. After: +150 Ferocity at all times, up to +480 while attuned to Air with Fury), and the new Pyromancer's Training, while no longer a guaranteed buff when attuned to Fire, is now a guaranteed buff against Burning targets regardless of attunement, and if you're attuned to fire your enemy is almost certainly Burning. It's hard to say what the overall impact will be, but my gut feeling is that once people get their rotations sorted out there will be a net gain.
---
ye,fuck that chrono,cripled dog,bleeding.... just put him out of this misery already. removing skills,without any compensation what so ever,true balance.
---
Because a whole other trait got added to the same tier that's much better for condi thieves.
---
It does. I dont have problems with it except for GW2.
---
Do you may have a link to a benchmark tool? I never testet that.
---
No you have no control other than joining someone in party/squad
---
Umm, can anyone explains this then?
---
[https://dps.report/zYps-20190702-210805\_enso](https://dps.report/zYps-20190702-210805_enso)
---
You cant think about your health before going into shroud, it is literally 50% of the rotation. If you wait, your DPS drops to like 30%. Why not apply the same penalty to bezerker? Sure, they lose 300 vitality, but they can nonstop be healed to full during their "power mode". What about holosmith? No other class gets a 100% healing debuff that is up 50% of the time.
---
Also, Soul Eater comes out to around 3-4% more DPS potential than DDef, the healing through shroud is what really seals it as probably the better option.
---
And lastly, Parasitic Contagion cant be compared since there is no shroud to heal through on scourge. But also, if (for some reason) you run base necro, it heals there. In PvE, running PC is literally monster levels more heal than SE. The argument is a straw man though since the heal on SE doesnt do the same function as PC; the PC heal is to get tons of healing, the SE heal is to address the outdated mechanic of 100% heal reduction in shroud.
---
And F1-3 are different from base Mesmer now.
---
There are dozens, DOZENS of us ele in PvP! Hahaha yes, it seems Anet is not sure what exactly is it that ele's need, and tbh, Im not sure myself either.
---
At least they buffed core necro shroud...for the 3 people who use it.
---
PvE balance doesn't really matter
---
No power! Only condi!
---
Not so much a cinematic I guess but could you do something with the swaying while speaking to other npcs? It's like my character is in a whole different world while speaking..
---
"Mordremoth has forces deployed in our base-.. Commander?"
---
"that cloud looks like a bunny..."
---
well it is one of their only condi weapons with dd #3
---
Wonder if anet could expand on the changes to Laser's Edge. I assume that because it's a dynamic calculation it'll go 1% mult damage increase per 1% forge up to a maximum of 50%??? Not really clear how they intend to do it...
---
I personally see the festivals and these repeat weekly events good since I can see it being being a good idea for long term Free-2-Play players or for players that cannot afford the expansions yet.  So they can't enjoy the new raids or the new living stories being dropped and can still log into the game periodically for "Limited Time" events.  How are you supposed to convince someone to upgrade out of a free to play account if they can never see the maps get filled with players and can't therefore see that the game isn't dead?  (And let's be honest, Snowden Drifts isn't the most hopping place outside of Stampede time)
---
Yeah, losing my f5 skill has me scared as well. I absolutely love the Med Pack Drop for the massive condi cleanse it provides, now my main (flamethrowe farm) is completely without condi cleanse...
---
Right now we don't have (mostly for PvP):   
---
Any kind of meaningfull damage burst build, good survivability, meaningfull condies (we only have fire and bleed, which are not that good in PvP),  
---
only thing that's left are support builds that are very boring to play and you can't really carry with it.
---
And me! I don't care if it's unconventional, I enjoy PvP tempest too much to let go.
---
Pls explain to me why a Dps class should use a support/heal traitline in endgame PvE. (Talking about blood magic). If i want bad dps i also just can play full minstral dps reaper tbh. 
---
No offens, but i think you missed the point that OP is talking about a PvE Endgame Dps Class and not about surviving in open world. 
---
Still I agree with the pvp/wvw nerf.
---
Separating the power trait from the condi one is pretty nice, i'm a little worried about that 3s internal cooldown, but i don't think it will that much of a problem, i mean, now it's 2 stacks every 3s of hitting something, not random stacks on hit.
---
AND condi damage+ with the trait, giving us a solid and CONSISTENT condi trait that will work with every thief weapon, i dig it.
---
The original nerf was PvP based so I assume this one is to even though I can't see it make that much of a difference. ANet must of seen some reason for it even if it makes no sense.
---
i always felt strange going condi AND power builds with the same weapon set.
---
pistol\dagger was my first take on condi thief back in the days, sbow was always pretty close and i like to use it as a ranged option when i use my condi daredevil in open world, skill #4 is insanely good with venoms, i mean.. you can keep stuff in permastun and stacking a lot of poison.
---
10 is not enough cus the enemy might stealth for 14 seconds so 18 or perma would be nice 👍
---
RIP condi rev...  Shadow leaping in maly was a huge part of the rotation.
---
Deadly Ambition is pretty much a straight increase and we don't know what the new poison preparation is yet in terms of damage.
---
Sure, there was a ton of skills in GW1 making it a nightmare to balance. And surely the GW2 approach to skills makes it easier to balance. But then again, A.Net decided to get rid of skills, the active elements and add a GW1-like diversity through runes, sigils, traits, gear stats, ... making the whole thing again overly complicated and impossible to balance. Except that now you have a bunch of elements that I doubt many get excited over.
---
Personally I'd rather have the GW1 situation because a shit tone of crappy skills was absolutely much more intriguing than a shit tone of crappy runes or sigils.
---
Still no arguments.
---
I second that
---
I'm super happy big overhauls like this happen. If they didn't everything would be more and more set in stone. Remember optimal dungeon comps pre HoT and how pretty much 5/8 professions barely saw play? Super fun right?
---
To be honest, the reason why most people are complaining about balance patches is because completely broken builds have been allowed to exist for waaaaay too long and people got used to their powercreeping comps.
---
A giant fuck-you nerf to condi.
---
Needs a bear in the background! /s
---
Seriously though great work!
---
Felt the same for GW1's balance patches for years!
---
Proper games would fight gameplay boredom with introducing new specs or professions. Meanwhile anet toys with balance, cause they cant afford more than 2 expansions in 7 years
---
I am hoping to see all unblockables be transferred over to this new system that is being implemented with Call of the Wild?
---
Signet of Might still casts 6 second of unblockables: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Signet_of_Might
---
"Nothing can save you" still casts 4 seconds of unblockables: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/"Nothing_Can_Save_You!"
---
Seems like this Call of the Wild change was a "let's do something about this unblockable skill that is affecting sniper soulbeasts", rather than reduce the damage coefficient of the skills in general.
---
It shouldn't be called balance patch because after this many "balance patches" one would think they would get the balance right after a while. No, they are ***NEW META PATCHES*** prove me wrong
---
It didn't seem too bad for dragonhunter at first, but it does take a hit with this patch
---
Overall here are the meta build changes:
---
• 10% critical hit chance are being removed
---
•  a 10% dmg modifier is removed and a 5% dmg modifier is added;
---
•  a 7% dmg modifier roughly becomes a 5% dmg modifier;
---
•  an immediate 10% damage modifier is changed to a progressive 10% dmg modifier;
---
•  -100 ferocity;
---
 •  -10 power (+110 on greatsword);
---
•  a portion of the damage from scepter 2 is nerfed by 25%, but this nerf is compensated by a 10% symbols dmg modifier tuned up to a 30% dmg modifier;
---
• greatsword receives a 20% cooldown reduction.
---
So mobas are not proper games? Most MMOs are not proper games? All of them rely on reworks, other MMOs even rework each classes gameplay every expansion instead of adding new stuff.
---
calm your tits buddy... it is not a 10% overall nerf
---
it is a 7% modifier nerf in fire since oyu have 3% mode from swift revenge and you got 90 ferocity 180 condition damage more burn while in fire (round about 5% nerf while fire main attune )  
---
you got 3% buff while in air main attunement and 60 ferocity more while in air attunement  (round about 4-5% buff while in air attune )
---
in addition you get shorter stance cd
---
then again condi weaver will just be stronger now
---
When your playerbase is too casual for balance changes.
---
Reaper nerf makes me a saaaad panda
---
Core thief used to have three dodges in acro traitline, and then they nerfed it and gave it to an elite instead and called it 'different' .
---
I'd go with making conjures work like kits, but with share ammo to limit their use.
---
* Conjures reworked to work like kits, but with ammo.  
---
* Ammo is shared between all skills, and different skills use different amounts of ammo. Each skill will show the number of possible uses with the current ammo, like the skills of the [Vlast Avenger](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vlast_Avenger).  
---
* 50 total ammo for each weapon. The autoattack will always consume just 1 ammo, so players can see total ammo left more easily. When the kit is unequipped, the Conjure skill will also show its ammo.  
---
* Ammo only recharges while the weapon is stowed and when out of combat. 
---
* Skill #5 of each conjure would be vastly improved with a greater effect, but using it would consume all ammo left and put the conjure on recharge. The more ammo used by the skill, the stronger its effect and the longer the recharge.  
---
----
---
Conversely, engineer kits could also get ammo, which would allow improving them greatly.   
---
For example, mortar kit could be reworked into a Mine Launcher:
---
* Ammo:  
---
 * Skill #1 gets 8 ammo.  
---
 * Skills #2-5 share 1 ammo, meaning you can only fire 1 at a time. 
---
* Recharge:  
---
 * Skill #1 flips over to a Reload skill when the ammo runs out. Reload takes 1.5s (0.75s when traited)  
---
 * Ammo of skills 2-5 recharges on its own, every 20s (15 when traited)  
---
* Improvements:  
---
 * Skill #1 now fires sticky mines that last 10s and explode when players come near them. They can be placed in walls and roofs too.  
---
 * The AoE of skills #2-5 now have greater effects and last 20s after firing them to compensate their shared ammo.  
---
* Trait Orbital Command replaced with "Demoman":  
---
 * Increases attack speed of skill 1 by 50%.
---
 * Halves reload time.  
---
 * Reduces secondary ammo recharge by 25%.  
---
 * Enemies triggering 3 or more mines at the same time causes a Blast Finisher.
---
As a pretty much pvp only player I am not too fussed. Given how much less dps you can put down in pvp it didn't make a massive difference. I mean if you hit someone with a 10k grave digger it only healed for 500. The actual healing numbers per second are negligible.
---
In pve I can understand why it is too strong. With the amount of damage you can do per second in group scenarios then it super strong.
---
\&gt; [Continuum Shift](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Continuum_Shift):  This skill now replaces distortion in the F4 slot instead of taking the  F5 slot. Additionally, it applies 1 second of distortion when cast.  Duration has been rescaled based on the number of clones to 3/4.5/6  seconds. This skill now specifies that it cannot be reset by other  mesmer skills. 
---
RIP my muscle memory
---
Eh, while this patch isnt one of them, yeah most patches randomly nerf thief (usually targetting thief builds that *already arent very good* and buff things that dont matter. See: Swipe nerf deleting the already underperforming D/P build for no reason at all).
---
Okay, even if what you say were to be true, is it worse than having the same comp for everything everywhere, and the rest of the professions never seeing use and actively being shunned like what used to be the case with dungeons?
---
I haven't played GW2 in so long but I loved original guild wars for the theorcrafting. I can't wait to log in and test out the thief changes!
---
The trait wasn't "way too good", it just meant that you were no longer penalised for not being healed when you'd go into shroud for your rotation. This way, we are back to the days of missing out on scholar uptime because we can't be healed by anyone in shroud, making reaper even more of a liability compared to other DPS alongside our mediocre benchmark. If you go ahead into shroud without being healed, you lose scholar and DPS. If you wait to be healed, you still lose DPS because you're losing time, as opposed to *anything* else that can continue with their rotation and be healer no problem.
---
&gt; Any complaints here are just feeding into the 'anet hates necro' meme when its in the best place its been in PvE for awhile 
---
\&gt;that feel when only power spellbreaker has a lower DPS benchmark than you compared to every. other. power. DPS. class. I'm happy that I have something, at least, but I'm not going to just lie and say "oh we're in a great place", because we're really not. Not only is shroud a liability due to healing *again*, the DPS is mediocre and we provide no good, unique buffs to make power reaper a solid choice as DPS.
---
It wouldn't be a deal of any size if there was a reason i could understand about why its done the way it is, because time and time again its just confused me while i try to explore and enjoy the game that was crafted, using the means i was given in the ways they were intended to be used. people keep mistaking my question for "why doesnt anet just remove all barriers we can already break out of the map", but it will be much clearer when i get the chance to take some pictures and actually document to Anet what places make me question whether it was intentional map design or an oversight that just didnt get in the way of anything major so it was ignored. If they truly are putting all resources at Anet back into gw2, id like to see this come as part of some world polish to make the maps a little better for mount and glider usage.
---
But still not as good as other classes. And then this gets nerfed? I don't know man. 
---
And I could bet you complained about thief being nerfed again as well?
---
Every time someone unironically posts "necro 2 tanky 2 gud", Grenth 'escorts' a Quaggan into the afterlife.
---
Except it's literally what Chrono already does through traits and the only different one is Rewinder, the condition shatter. For some reason. Because Mirage doesn't exist. It's a false mirage.
---
We can only hope
---
It says that only the trait no longer heals. This doesn't mean that other players can't heal you. If you go shroud &lt;90%, your healer should heal you up back to 100% in no time.
---
I mean, good on you if you happen to have good dps. Majority of SpBs that I meet (me included) have severely reduced dps compared to core berserker. /shrug
---
As long as the increased barrier gain compensates for that though it'll be fine.
---
II HAAVE THE POOOWWAAA
---
How am I supposed to play chrono in WvW if I need active clones to use continuum split!? Could you PLEASE think about this change again?
---
Seems like u never heard of dota or league of legends or wow or overwatch or pubg or CoD or smash or literally any fucking game.        
---
Balance is never going to be perfect, stop that weak ass complaint "aFtER aLl thIS TiME".
---
According to current math the new trait is \~2.5% increase over the old one, just because something has an ICD doesn't immediately throw it in the garbage can. That's under optimal scenarios, in less optimal scenarios where you might drop quickness or have to stop attacking for a moment the ICD trait only gets better.
---
*Drunk Scrapper intensifies*
---
*But then notices weird as nerfs were given to rifle *
---
This is gonna be awkward
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
&gt; reaper is meta in every single game mode 
---
:( some day
---
The problem with them is that they are full kits, replacing all of your weapon skills with more useless skills. If it were possible to make them only replace their respective slots, while providing buffs while held, that would be amazing. 
---
But I can't even begin to imagine the amount of work it would take to make that happen.
---
It's still a problem when you're new, don't yet have the gold to convert to gems, just emptied your wallet on expansions but get this surprise of LS2-3-4. I'm relaying the words of a newbie I adopted: "so you mean I can't really enjoy the story I've just bought unless I also buy these seasons?". It just feels wrong/cashgrabby. OP makes a good point about turning away more potential customers than making lots of money with LS sales.
---
Let me dream damnit! Lol
---
 did you see that ludicrous display last night
---
If you could hit something while in shroud you could fully heal yourself from near death with the damage shroud gives you.
---
&gt; i always felt strange going condi AND power builds with the same weapon set.
---
warrior sword does the same
---
the last time someone said something like that female humans lost 2 out of their 3 idle animations, so please don't..
---
That's only the case if you were doing well of suffering+gs4+gs5-&gt;ds 4, and although I didn't test values, I do know that from raids it wouldn't heal to 100% at maybe 40% hp? I don't remember entirely. The trait seemed like a nice compromise considering we can't be healed by anyone else when in shroud, which can severely limit personal DPS due to lacking scholar/waiting for heals and having DPS downtime.
---
It's still pretty meh in WvW/PvP because players aren't usually kind enough to let you burst them for free, and since most players know to dodge the big shroud scythe at this point, the range limitation makes it even more annoyingly limited.
---
the private instance version sounds cool even though this is probably all totally fake. alot of this speaks to the idea of Anet finding new ways to incentivize having people work together and incentivizes guild activity. There are deffinitely benefits to this idea although i dont think anet would do it because they wouldnt want to take players away from the map populations and make their game looks deserted to investors who log in just to observe it in its raw state.
---
No gear treadmill has been a big selling point of the game however they've failed to engage players in a meaningful way to replace it. Legendaries were an appealing grind early on as they provide a nice feature in stat changing without giving an advantage but most people already have plenty of them or have enough ascended boxes to gear up multiple alts. Then they introduced masteries which turned out to be glorified experience bars and didn't really require anything specific. That leaves us with nothing to strive for and improve our characters. There's no incentive to do anything other than farming cosmetics. An MMORPG with no progression and grouping incentives is a single player game with optional co-op.
---
Seems like the person behind this balance change really hated passive healing from traits... It wasn't a lot of healing but the passive healing on Guardian GS felt decent enough....
---
Swipes range is just idiotic. If they want to nerf it give it 900 range, like every other shadowstep thief has. Sword, dagger/pistol, shortbow all have superior teleport range to swipe. Staff itself has no teleport at all so steal was the main go to for that.
---
Ayyyyeeee
---
Oh no, god forbid players pay attention to mechanics instead of expecting another player to do it for them!
---
I'm not sure how the numbers will turn out for guardians, changes are interesting (especially making the greatsword trait in zeal more like a warrior's), bow got huge bows and scepters got a huge nerf so maybe now we can somewhat use it in pve scenarios?
---
Signets give aegis to the group. We have to time them better.
---
So that your McCree build can do more damage with a single pistol, of course!
---
well that's just funny
---
Fixed the fix to revert it to the initial state.
---
Anet is so inconsistent with skills that can be used in more than one direction that they forget that some of them work backwards because they fixed them to be used that way.
---
They put up walls in places they don't want you to go. Sometimes it's for the mystery of what could behind there (where you can see over a wall a little bit), sometimes it's because if you go to a place you can see the edge of the map, and other times it's just cause they don't want you to break out of the map.
---
It's really not a big deal.
---
* I remember Joko's mocap-ed monologue being a highlight of the season, but what are some of the other performances that we might not have noticed? Have you used multiple actors in the same scene at the same time?
---
* Not a specific question, but just some insight into the design process and execution of the "trippier" cinematics like Aurene's visions with the fractal/kaleidoscopic effects.
---
* Also generally curious about the differences in the normal gameplay rigs and models versus the ones used in lip-synced cinematics (since both kinds are used 'in-game'). Are the heads just swapped out or...?
---
The current GM minor already gave you +10% to burning foes regardless of attunement though. So that damage is just gone now.
---
Fire Adept has 2 traits that are focused on utilities no one rally uses anymore. Conjures and cantrips. If you aren't running a niche build there isn't even a choice in adept.
---
that is definitely true... we will see how ele ends up after the patch... i am still kinda mad they did not buff it since it actually deserved a buff considering daredevil or mirage which are 2 of the op builds are basically untouched
---
Hahahaha

\&gt; @"Inverse.5817" said: &gt; &gt; @"memausz.7264" said: &gt; &gt; Okay, ArenaNet, I'm sorry, but THIS cannot happen: &gt; &gt; "Overload: Overloading now disables all toolbelt skills for its duration." &gt; &gt; That's NOT a tweak, that's fundamental change in how holosmiths play. &gt; &gt; This will hurt PvE, too - overheat blast damage from Photon Blasting Module is a big part of Holo's DPS, and retaining the 10% bonus damage while your heat gauge empties from overheat is nice - but not without, for example, grenade barrage, or the ability to CC raid bosses with AED and bomb kit's toolbelt skills. At least make it so you can still retain your toolbelt while traited to PBM, or make some kind of PvE/PvP split for it. Please. As someone who loves rifle &amp; kits holo, and has done since PoF came out, this is really discouraging to see. Yeah it's really dumb on their end. If they think toolbelt skills need to be weakened, reduce those as they are, reduce Power Wrench strength, just SOMETHING other than disabling them when Overload occurs. And while we are at it, ArenaNet, could you PLEASE buff Elixir R toolbelt skill to 50 second cooldown and reduce cooldown of Elixir R (with HGH) to 20 seconds? It feels weak compared to other skills because of excessively long cooldowns.

You may not post rude comments directed towards our staff, teams, or the company, and your comment has been removed. Thanks for your understanding.
---
I guess ArenaNet cannot take the criticism
---
it seems like a pvp change that bled through to pve for some reason
---
Worst case scenario the scepter was nerfed by 2.6%. Best case it got an 18.2% buff.
---
Those thief changes... I might actually return to the game if this goes well
---
Soul Eater was overpowered in PvE. I say this as somebody who plays both open world and high level content. I could go in Shroud at 1 hp and heal back up to full when my shroud ends. It was pretty absurd.
---
Have you guys never played power reaper before this change? It always seen as the tankiest class in PvE as suggested by practically everyone. Soul eater just made it pretty much invincible.
---
The only real issue this change might affect is that you will have a harder time upkeeping the scholar bonus as you might take a hit right before entering shroud.
---
&gt; A) you dont have a CD on when the distort will be ready again
---
Why not, it'll be the cooldown of the signet. Just stop using the goddamn SoI already, it's awful, just get proper 100% boon duration through gear instead of building with berserker stats for damage and pretending like anyone cares about your few thousands of dps in a world where any decent dps class sneezes and does 20-30k.
---
That That_Shaman solo was lit.
---
Even 3% is way too high, if it up to me it would be 1% at the most in PvE.
---
I play exclusively power reaper in fractal cm and raids. Hell I cleared wing 6(except largos cm) and 7 CM with power reaper when it came out because is fun. There has not been a case where I was turned away even before the soul eater change because losing 5% damage modifier on specific situations is not end of the world and is not going to be the reason you are denied. People sometimes deny necros still largely due to community perception that is bad when in reality is power holo dps. The perception is the biggest thing needs to change before crying to anet about anything else. This is supremely over blown.
---
Lmao accurate on everything. Makes me wonder if the devs notice this stuff or do they just come in and watch this video and are clueless.
---
&gt;The Meld With Shadows buff is nice, though Hidden Thief most likely will still be the pick
---
You can have both.  Meld with Shadow is a minor.
---
For the Grandmasters, Clocked in Shadow siphon's life when you blind foes.  Which happens a lot and is AOE.  It will be interesting to see the coefficient for the skill.  And the trait also causes you to blind foes on stealth (I believe this is an AOE blinding powder trigger) which is the reason I ever took it.  No crit in stealth is nice, but the blind on stealth is great for getting stealth stomps and now it will leach life when you do that.
---
I also want to know the internal cooldown for the siphon bc thief has so much access to blind.
---
That would be the case if every combination was different. That's not what I'm saying at all.

* 5 Tier 1 effects
---
* 1 Tier 2 effect
---
* 1 Tier 3 effect
---
* 1 Tier 4 effect
---
* 1 Tier 5 effect
---
That's not 31. That's 9. And 4 of those would just be recolors - a 10 minute job, tops.
---
As a trait. They took it away and made it baseline BEFORE HoT, and all the rotations and balance since was made _with it in mind_.
---
Can't use those while stunned, or while resurrecting someone who went down in an AoE field.
---
Again, as a _fucking_ trait. They took it away and made it baseline BEFORE HoT, and all the rotations and balance since was made _with it in fucking mind._
---
As someone who enjoys this reddit for constructive commentary from people who actually still endorse the game, so am I.
---
&gt; Deathstrike: This skill no longer chills or slows.
---
I was sad.
---
&gt; Focused Siphoning: Increased power scaling by 400% in PvE only. Increased healing scaling by 400% in PvE only.
---
Now I'm just content once more.
---
Well if they keep buffing it, more ppl will use it. 
---
I would love to see some core necro build in pvp.
---
Both were called bugs.
---
Wow, that's a high quality video!
---
I only raid in power reaper ever since the launch of raids unless is in specific situations such as largos. So yes I know the drill. If you want more experience, majestbat here is the guy who benches power reaper dps. He is the guy who power reaper look up how much damage you should do and he is ok with the change.
---
The simple fact with your situation is that going to shroud at low hp while is an issue due to scholar. It was never the dealbreaker because 1) It never really happened that often and 2) Soul stealer still heal out of shroud, you should be comboing well, gs4 and axe 2 right before going to shroud. It would take an extremely lucky strike to bring you to so incredibly low right before that all those damage can't you heal back up.
---
Your shroud consists of roughly 60% of your damage based on benchmark logs, assuming you screw up every single time you enter in shroud which is incredibly unlikely. You would miss about 945 dps.
---
This is not a dealbreaker.
---
What if #2 is about firing backward when your target is in front of you?
---
AH, thank you, that's what I was looking for.
---
The original story arc from the game's launch is free to play.
---
The following content has to be purchased separately and should be played in the following order if you care about playing the story in chronological order:
---
* Living World Season 2 (Purchased in-game with gems)
---
* Heart of Thorns
---
* Living World Season 3 (Purchased in-game ... )
---
* Path of Fire
---
* Living World Season 4 (Purchased in-game ... )
---
If you just want to get an expansion just for the content it provides, then here are the major features they add to the game:
---
**Heart of Thorns**
---
* Gliding (can be used pretty much anywhere in the game)
---
* 4 "Tall" Maps with great Meta-Events  
---
These maps have events that require teamwork and there are lots of difficult enemies for solo PvE.
---
* 2 Guild Halls to choose from
---
* 4 Raid Wings
---
* Viper's Stats on Items (Optimal for condition damage builds)
---
**Path of Fire**
---
* Mounts (can be used almost anywhere in the game)
---
* 5 "Wide" Maps with much more solo-friendly content and enemies.
---
* 1 Guild Hall to choose from
---
* 3 Raid Wings
---
* Grieving Stats on Items (OK for condition damage builds)
---
My personal recommendation is to get Path of Fire because the mounts are the greatest QoL change to the game.
---
What the actual fuck are those scrapper changes? From bad to possibly even worse, why even bother?
---
The problem is that even if you "threaded" the Mesmer's portal through there wouldn't be any real reason to do so in the first place. Why not just use a Mesmer portal in the first place and pull more Mesmers through that? Why not have the Mesmer use personal stealth as they can already easily reach 5000 range with mimic blink and stealth?
---
Also you probably wouldn't be able to port into keeps because I assume the thief would drop the entrance first (inside the tower) and jump down outside to drop the exit (outside the tower) doesn't work with a 1-way.
---
Honestly I feel like the idea of a 1 way portal with a 5 target cap is going to fall pretty flat even with stealth upon exiting.
---
Also I couldn't find that thread sorry.
---
Hmm, I’m reading that you might need a dual link dvi, which has a different cable, to achieve 144hz.  This is beyond my area of expertise though, I only wanted you to confirm you were using digital vs analog on DVI.
---
Are you positive you aren’t running at a higher resolution in game now vs before?
---
Im positive the "I just bought Expac Y, why cant I Play on?" Argument is an immensely influential one for People burned by Freemium "F2P" MMOs, which in itself is a great target audience for the game - if Noone explains you the Business model, it Looks scummy and may well scare off potential customers
---
and then they increased barrage damage by 25% rofl
---
Goodbye WvW, stealth will be king, 1st group to get in stealth will destroy the enemy. Fuck anet they have no idea about WvW.
---
Doesn't this also hit staff way harder than sword again? Since being in air is worse for staff. I really wish Anet would buff staff a little again (without making it less fun again).
---
Ah well... fuck me that's a short century in some fights. Anet why the long CD bud? Maybe it'll be justified.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Expansion
---
This lays it out the flow of content quite well.
---
Right.... riiiiiight. Reading comprehension.
---
Question is if I should venture onto the forums again...
---
I thought is was the other way around: "Shit, guys, this necro in WvW won't die!  They always kill me!  No fair!!"
---
I play Fresh Air tempest in pve, but that's one of the easiest rotations and if you take Earth instead of Fire you gain a shit ton of survivability without losing too much dps. It's pve after all, and I have never claimed to be super good at the class (and being so damn squishy doesn't help).
---
I'm probably not the target demographic here though. I haven't touched pvp in YEARS.
---
Wait, doesn't that kinda jank support chrono opener?
---
Longbow soulbeast got absolutely destroyed this porch holy shit
---
I'm hoping sword ends up being better somehow later on the road but it's probably wishful thinking. I'm not very happy about the loss of 100 ferocity in radiance nor the likely 2% damage loss from pure of sight but symbolic powder buffing symbols by 30%... wtf. Either I'm misunderstanding or that sounds op af. It's kind of stupid though because that obviously benefits scepter the most, which means it's securing it as the best.
---
Meanwhile I'm over here as one of the five people who still play scrapper, wondering if this rework will make the spec actually enjoyable finally
---
Hard as hell to get a solid grip on how the changes play out, but I'm so far...concerned. -300 vit, wat
---
Well, they have a history of taking away core traits from thief just to give them back as an elite spec, so, yes.
---
1 - Mesmers are slow.  With the help of a Thief's portal, they can get behind enemy zergs faster.
---
2 - If you play WvW, you know Commanders call out AOE bombs on portals.  With the use of a secondary portal from a Mesmer in stealth, you can still catch zergs off guard as they wait for people to pop through the Shadow Portal.
---
3 - Scroll down for more.
---
Also, I'm only talking about portal bombs, not getting into Keeps.  That's a Mesmer's job.
---
Nah I understood it, I just wanted to tell you about how weird Hoelbrak is because you were obviously meming about being in 'interesting' places so I figured it would be appropriate to say how retarded it is that you can swim down under the map for over 10 minutes before hitting the bottom.
---
I gotta ask, is that sound you use at 3:51 for every video Lover's Mask by Theophany?
---
It's been bugging me for a long time.
---
5/5 stuff btw.
---
I wonder if this change to trap-based skills is going to be extended to DH or if they'll be maintaining such a designation?
---
I still miss the days when you could run to the middle area with all the turrets near the ooze boss in arah p1 and just reflect them all in one go with daggerstorm. I for one am not very happy to see the cast time reduced lmao.

---
I don't raid and I feel like I should never need a party or other players in any open word map outside of a clearly defined meta event.  Some classes/specs pull this off but some don't and that always seems to be because of some nerf made to content of a completely different style or even game mode from what I'm wanting to do.  
---
I miss the days when combat was based more on auto attacks for damage and other skills for effects like CCs and such.  
---
The shift of design focus to fights centering around a few massive mobs (Actually just one at the time more often than not) screwed everything up and I no longer believe Anet is even capable of salvaging this mess, even if they wanted to, in spite of the more recent mobs being the best candidates we have seen yet to that original intended design.  
---
They can't balance shit in PvE now because they're running two absurdly different pve game styles right now (Open world, old dungeons and FotM T3 versus Raid content style (that's been infesting other content) and FotM T4)  They're making a mess of OPEN WORLD class/spec performance trying to balance shit around raids FFS.  
---
Deadeye feels as if it may as well be a core thief unless I'm semi-afking a world boss fight, DH's weapon (one of it's big selling points) is a joke, Elementalist has managed to get nerfed so hard that playing it open world against any newer mob group is akin to sadomasochism, and it feels like things such as Daredevil's staff recently took unwarranted PvE nerfs in a lame attempt to push people to use other specs (or somebody was too fucking lazy to make a skill split).  Lest we forget that Tempest was nerfed prior to PoF and I believe it was because Anet knew the Weaver would not have been able to compete.  Etc.  
---
Simply put, if I think the flavor of the day sucks then I'm not going to buy it and adding bittering agents to the ones I do like isn't going to help you sell me shit that I don't like.  They need to stop balancing around making the flavor of the day.  But they keep on doing knee jerk balances, ad hoc changes with a "well let's just see" mindset which they never planned on cleaning up anyway, and cleaning it up now would just be too much work so it's never going to get better IMO.  
---
What pisses me off more is that all that above could have been avoided VERY easily, and could still be fixed if they would pick one fucking vision and rework the whole game around it, then never deviate.  It's been a huge problem for them that they spent too long innovating something and quitting it instead of building on what they had just made.  Some level of this is the stated reason NCSoft stepped on their tails recently, I only hope the lesson takes this time.  
---
As for this round of changes specifically, they managed to only mess with my condi rev build that I don't particularly like as much anyway, and while it looks like my DH's bow build might actually see some round-about improvements, why the fuck can't they go about it with something as simple as undoing the old nerfs for pve only?
---
Whats a staff?
---
Which is what I'm saying...
---
Embrace the Darkness applies even more torment, because AFAIK your Skill 1 is also considered skill-usage, which applies even more condis.
---
You just forget everyother demon skill (aside from maybe Call of Anguish for grouping when necessary) and keep stacking the torment up.
---
When you run out of energy, just keep hitting on another stance and come back right after.
---
Maybe the first change was meant to allow some sort of "about face", I think this skill used to go on cd when the target was behind, and the second bugfix is meant to prevent the projectile to go behind your back when you aren't in a situation where about face can occur (while running for instance). Just a guess
---
That's anet's whole balance strategy: buff unpopular skills, nerf popular ones.
---
They found the REAL Old LA!
---
by that I assume you mean pve where it’s solid but not op. If you’re in wvw or pvp they’re a bit of a joke and you usually see fb
---
Rip acrobatics
---
MMO devs tend to do this in every game. 5+ in, they completely revamp class mechanics. God knows why. I've played this class 5+ years because I enjoyed how it feels, completely changing everything about it does nothing but driving me away. Happened in so many MMOs that I stopped playing in some point.
---
In GW2, that development reached a critical point for me when they completely revamped how phantasms worked. Then, later on, after years and years and years, they completely changed how SoI worked. And God knows I loved the mechanic of boon spread. Balance completely left aside. Getting a boon and then spreading it to the people around you - amazing! And now? Dead. I loved the synergy between Arcane Thievery and SoI, or CS and Mimicry, or ...
---
So yeah, I'm still playing, but with every major revamp of my class I feel more disconnected. That's all they achieve.
---
Right im already thinking of a build with these changes.
---
Before the Berserker changes (removing normal adrenaline bursts), the difference between power warrior and berserker was mainly that core warriors had Strength, Discipline, and Tactics traits, so they could have all the good stuff from Discipline and Tactics (quick swap with adrenaline gain, better banners, empower allies, etc.), plus Strength's Peak Performance giving extra DPS and recharge of physical (read: cc) skills. So they did have more uses of cc skills like Kick and Rampage. Berserkers had to give up either the Discipline traits or Tactics traits to get that. So a more accurate thing to say than "core warriors have more cc" is that they don't have to give up some support or DPS ability to get their amount of cc.
---
Now that Zerkers don't have access to the normal burst and have to build up to adrenaline level three until they can start using bursts, the comparison is a bit more complicated. Core warriors can use level one and two bursts, plus have less cooldown on their burst compared to Berserk Mode or Head Butt/Wild Blow (8s for Mace's F1 vs Berserk Mode's 15s and 5s for Berserk Mace's F1, and 20s for Head Butt/Wild Blow). So in the time that it takes for Head Butt to recharge, you could have two core Mace F1s and be halfway to a second. Plus core uses kick, which does 150 break bar damage per kick, and has three charges, for a total of 450, compared to Wild Blow's 332 and Head Butt's 300.
---
The main thing is that the core warrior "meta" build allows for all three power DPS trait trees, and uses cc skills as part of its rotation to boost its DPS (Peak Performance, which also improves cooldown), all while keeping buffs from better banners and Empower Allies, and has Rampage ready as a cc panic button/powerhouse. Power berserker has to give up one of those to get the benefits of berserker, plus they usually take either the rage skill with stability or the rage stun break instead of Wild Blow to offset the self-stun from Head Butt.
---
So it all kinda depends on the "meta" build and how it works, and numbers-wise, core warrior's meta build does a bit more cc than power Berserker's does. Disregarding mace skills, since both builds are using them and I'm too lazy to look up their cc values, and assuming banners in two slots, core warrior with mace F1 (300) and kick (150x3) does more cc damage (750 than zerker does (732) with Wild Blow (332), Headbutt (300), and mace F1 (100). But that's if you're using Wild Blow instead of another rage skill to offset Head Butt's stun, otherwise it drops from 732 to 400, plus core has Rampage for extra cc. 
---
Although, all things considered, I prefer playing berserker (both power and condi), it's more fun for me, and while the extra cc from going core warrior is somewhat notable, it's not enough of a difference to matter much unless your group is really struggling with cc.
