I'll start the salt storm I guess?
---

---
Can't wait to see 50 of these things pulling down gates in 5 seconds because knowing ANet they literally don't bother checking how things work before throwing it in there awww yisss.
---
---
---
&gt;No, that's my point. Since the mount is WvW focused that means unless they surprise us with something completely new and unique (like I don't know, a horde mode or something), the new release will offer very little content for PvE players past the 2 hour story.
---
I mean, they threw a bone to WvW players. I see absolutely nothing wrong with that since WvW didn't get something cool in ages. Moreover, it doesn't impact PvE content developement in any case nor does it downplay anything developed specifically for PvE. 
---
&gt;Especially considering said "expansion level" features most likely won't be usable outside open world if past expansions are anything to go by.
---
It depends on what they want to do. It could be just a giant lie and we're not getting anything interesting for a few more years. I prefer to tone down my speculations because anet will never meet them anyway.
---
&gt;If season 5 is anything like season 4, the game's fucked.
---
You are probably going to be disappointed since Anet rarely takes any risks. They'll probably stick to their safe formula and keep doing what they are doing. Moreover, you can't develop a good expansion in 1 year. It's been 1,5 years since the release of PoF, thus I think that season 5 is there to just stall for time till they are ready show something.
---
I like my popcorn salty anyway
---
Calm down, buddy, you're trying too hard. I'm sure people will like you if you just be yourself.
---
&gt; Yet Chrono will continue it's 3+ year grip on the meta for as long as it is the only profession that can bring both Quickness and Alacrity.
---
This is honestly the only reason I dislike Chronomancer. It just defines the PvE meta and has since it was added in HoT. If also devalues just about every other support. It's getting better, of course, but it's still an unhealthy class for the game in my opinion. It kinda just does everything the best depending on your build (top-tier DPS, the best support, the best tank, etc).
---
God damn I would give gold if I wasn't poor this is brilliant good sir.
---
They could make money on stuff that doesn't mess with sieging, choke points, and squad movement. The main glider I see is the WvW crafted back piece, are they making bank off of WvW players since gliding was introduced? I'd like a mount of some sort for stuff like desert map open spaces and canyons but this is dumb and no on will spend money on a dead game mode.
---
Have you ever played TF2, and thought the Gunslinger was so jarring and difficult to use? Have you ever played Zoe in League and thought she was a bit underpowered and clunky? Put in a little practice, watch a few tutorials, and you begin to realize that yes, it does require *some* practice, but once you get it down ....... ***you're just the newest recruit of the fun police***
---
I’m at work but go to YouTube and search for “the wall” build for dark souls. That’s how imagine you guys
---
Good point on not taking it first run. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The most fun commander I had (they were from a link server) had a hit and run tactic. Made sure supply was low on keep, and to get it drained, while keeping supply from camps locked down. We would rush the outer gate/wall and break through it and hide 2 mes inside. Then we would leave. We were on an outnumbered map, so even better. Ported back in through outer 15+ minutes later and rushed inner to cap it before anyone noticed. Easier to do on red BL because there are lots of places to hide. Got two t3 keeps in primetime, which my server is not good at. I've yet to see anything organized like that on my server again in over a year. It takes a competent group. All too often 75% of the zerg are just pressing the 1 button riding along for the k-train, but this group was great. 
---
I wonder how many more players they have for each living world update, and then how swiftly those people don't log in again until the next content patch. It's insane how little sustainable content this game has!
---
What did he chose in the end?
---
I’ve seen blobs and blobs and blobs across several servers that would put pve blobs to shame that seem to disagree with you there, champ.
---
to those gentlemen claiming there is "too little information" to be upset or simply concerned, i have but one thing to say: there is precedence, and plenty of it.
---
k. thx. by.
---
Ash, because he's trash. Pretty trash though 
---
ESO combat is mostly terrible. However, they communicate their road map, so they've got that going for them. 
---
&gt; You also know nothing about which mount skills will be allow or if any of the existing mount skills will be allowed.
---
this right here tells me you didnt even read any of it
---
I am pleased with the fact that you can glide only on the territory that you own. I don't mind having bonuses on a territory that you have claimed.
---
I understood that reference.
---
It's more about why they took a risk instead of fixing core issues. Nobody left the mode because there were no mounts. I doubt many people are going to come into wvw and stay long term because mounts now exist.
---
In PvE yeah. I'm wondering if it'll work differently in WvW.
---
People want good changes.
---
Legitimately my favorite dye, and it costs virtually nothing.
---
With the way that kind of content works, it's pretty much not possible to let people do it after the window has closed and the story's moved on. Unless, of course, you make heavy use of instancing like they did with GW1.
---
you should add the VB wyvern for this sweet 30s amalgated gemstome right before porting for TD
---
gladly you're so wise :) 
---
Basically Mesmer's Soulbeast?
---
Unless you get a commander who wants nothing more than to pound their head against a t2/3 tower with even or greater numbers defending, or who just wants to fight and lose over and over again on open fields, miles away from any objectives.
---
ANet ended partnership with iam8bit (except for vinyl soundtracks) so no, the old quaggan plushie won't return.
---
I run Fire/Air for weaver with full marauder stats - power/vitality/precision/ferocity (so, power weaver). Over 20K HP with a lot of regen capability - Woven Stride gives you regen when you get swiftness, while Swift Revenge means you get swiftness with every dual attack. Inscription means that when attuned to water  you get three sets of regen because of the glyphs - as well, Glyph of Elemental Harmony has a 16s CD because of Inscription. There's a possible total of 12 seconds of protection as well when attuned to earth!
---
Runes and sigils are where you can definitely make some changes. Superior Rune of Vampirism is *amazing* for survivability if you decide to run it, for example - it's another 2K health on top of what a full set of marauder gear gives you, so you'd be around 22K, plus a 10% heal per kill. 
---
This build may not be some min/maxed, tweaked-out super DPS Snow Crows build, but I really like it. There's a lot of damage, solid crit chance and crit damage, plus might, fury, regen, swiftness, and protection. Try it out and see how ti works for you.
---
I actually like this idea.
---
Population balance, which looks like will only happen when Alliances are even ready. So we are left with this server linking system as a bandaid, which encourages some amount of bandwagoning at least on the EU side of wvw, which I know occured in the past through people or guilds paying for cheap or the premium gem prices to the most populated servers.
---
Also it would be great to have wvw specific profession balance, server and engine optimizations, to reduce skill lag and visual noise, aswell as framerate.
---
or shortbow and warrior sprint for both melee and ranged weapons (a man can dream right?)
---
I'd say its more of a thing for warriors.
---
Hulk style smashers!
---
Warbringer is already a wvw theme glider skin though?
---
I forgot Mirage was ever a thing.
---
That's called retaliation
---
it would most likely result in multiple squads runningb together; There may be more closed tags (guilds are more likely to field close to 25 people, so less space for random followers in the squad) and pugmanding may become harder (because you have to be more selective in what classes you want in your squad....)
---
WvW became different things to different people. Only part of that was designed (GvG for example, was a grassroots attempt for high skill fights). Part of the WvW population gets outraged at anything and everything. Any attempt by Anet to change the current trajectory is going to piss some people off. Will this bring in enough new people? I guess we're going to find out.
---
Balance. 
---
It's always the quiet nerdy ones that are into the freakiest shit
---
That's a "problem" in every gamemode...not exclusive to WvW...balance patch is also included next week.
---
Next!
---
Sad, but true...
---
Yeah that would be aids af
---
LMAL
---
But... what's the point of it in PvE then if it has no skills and runs at the same speed as other mounts? Raptor can leap, springer can jump, skimmer can float, jackal can teleport, griffon can fly, beetle can break walls. What is the purpose of the warclaw in PvE...?
---
I'd say that the idea that WvW can or should be something other than a max vs max blobsmash or bagfarm is a rather unpopular one in general. 
---
It's already a jackal skin, no joke [take a look](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ceylon_Cut)
---
I just participated in a one CDR verdant brink map and got tier 4, it was exciting to say the least, and I'll participated again if I get a chance
---
Better class balance
---
Better server balance
---
Proper GvG support
---
Better perfomance

Ever since the nerf on chrono in fractals, Quickbrand has started to become more popular. Who doesn't like runs to end fast from big dps? 
---
As a dps *in fractals* I prefer having a Quickbrand over other supports. So much so that I made one myself. Mine is the power dps variant though. Basically plays like a core guard but spam quickness for party and has access to FB utilities via its Virtues. 
---
This is how ANET sees it. However, it's not the case. They just refuse to fix core problems and cover it up by pretending the community wants something new and shiny. 
---
As far as I'm concerned this was inevitable eventually. After all currently outside of elite specializations, they don't really have a way to incentivize World vs World players to buy expansions.
---
As for the reception of the mount, nothing unexpected there either, just as with gliding it really was just a matter of time before a mount ended up in World vs World in some shape or form. It will allow them to a) sell mount skins (just as with gliders before) to WvW players b) introduce additional incentive to buy the expansion and c) getting non World versus World players over to the game type if only temporarily most likely (they're obviously hoping some will stick around, even if to some hardcore players the idea of PVE casual in their game mode will probably cause them to lose sleep).
---
We reach a new low everytime we hear about WvW Updates. At this point I am very sure this is trolling so they do not have to update WvW anymore because nobody is playing it anymore at that point. How out of touch with the wvw community is arenanet actually?
---
There were crimson weapons. I don't know if those were around in the previous iteration because I hadn't participated in it, but if they were then I stand corrected and it only proves the point further either way xD
---
Merge with your illusions?
---
&gt;Yeah but think about how much the beetle impacted episode 3. Everyone loved that and beetle races.
---
I don't think the beetle affected the release of Episode 3 at all. Episode 3 was delayed by a little over a month, but this was because ArenaNet was reorganizing their teams a bit. So development itself got slowed down due to people moving.
---
Can we use it in pve? It looks very nice.
---
Just south of there is Naui Waters, which is even more picturesque!
---
A true warrior needs a weapon for every day of the week.
---
You just asked on a bad day.  WvW just got an update that a lot of players disagree with (adding a mount to WvW).  A bunch of them are on a rampage through the subreddit right now.  If you liked WvW before, you'll definitely like it now.  It's simply more of the same content, presented in a slightly better package.   Rewards certainly leave something to be desired, but that's just the nature of the game mode right now.  
---
&gt; That's a "problem" in every gamemode...not exclusive to WvW...
---
Oh my sweet naive child, always stay this innocent and don't ever step in WvW~
---
Don't mind me holding [my vial](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vial_of_Salt) near your cheek. Just needing a refill.
---
Renegade works well with power or conditions. Dual sword renegade is amazing fun with the renegade elite summon, let's you let a whole group just lifesteal through everything. 
---
I'm still not playing WvW
---
With mounts allowing people to get from point A to point B faster, this will be even more important. Before you can atleast pick off stragglers/groups before other groups add in (usually).
---
Greatsword channeling Balthazar, with his floating, sweeping attacks. 
---
That's probably the best outcome of all theories presented in this thread so far.
---
Wing 5 was pretty abysmal in terms of story and character design, imo. It'd be nice to get a small redemption on that.
---
I guess it depends on what they tweet next. A different god, the reapers, or Desmina?
---
But Dhuum hates resurrections and the undead. There's no way he would revive Aurene - he'd just seek out to consume her soul (presuming Kralkatorrik didn't).
---
How would you do that?
---
What is considered "exp" in WvW? I am curious, since you want to insinuate I am someone who has never done WvW.
---
What does quickness have to do with burst damage?
---
If there were classes that give alac and quickness w/o problems... Oh wait 
---
This feels very fitting with the new WvW mount coming out...
---
Is this about profitability or fun?
---
Doing something more than just dailies in your case sweetie. Roll up on your PvE class someday and go give a round of taking camps around EB for more than 30 minutes and see how that "balance" works out for you.
---
It actually isnt exclusive to wvw, that is just the only way to obtain it and the only mount you can use there. But Anet confirmed on their tumblr it is available to use in PvE, just not as useful as the other mounts.
---
The new mount, Warclaw. Does it mean it can only be used in WvW? Or in core Tyria too?
---
A lot of what you're saying resounds with my heart, couldn't have worded better:
---
&gt; it doesn't need gimmicky crap like mounts
---
&gt; ignoring community advice despite countless suggestions and adding in polarizing features nobody wanted is not the way to go
---
It's just.. So true. Sadly mass majority doesn't like truth when it comes to WvW discussion and would rather upvote some warcat idle animation praise posts (coming next week, stay tuned). But I'm with you on this viewpoint. A very nice and constructive post. Wish Anet would read it.
---
I won't even touch it unless/until I've got another precursor in the bank.
---
I'd *loooove* a 600-900 range throwing dagger spec for mesmer. 
---
Play whatever the hell you want on any raid boss with 10 players and you'll still kill the boss. Roll up to an equally sized enemy zerg playing longbow rangers and d/d thieves and you'll get wiped in seconds. The "play how you want" is not nearly as comparable between the two gamemodes.
---
&gt;In Draconis Mons we learned that killing an elder dragon would release enough energy to probably make Tyria explode. But if we kill Kralk in the underworld his magic wouldn't (possibly) reach Tyria.
---
Technically, what we learn is that magic overload is just a visible symptom that is not yet near a critical point. What would kill Tyria is not another Elder Dragon's worth of magic, but rather The All itself becoming imbalanced. In Path of Fire, Taimi calls it "the elder dragon imbalance" and mentions that Kralkatorrik becoming stronger further weakened that imbalance, sending us closer to destruction even without Kralkatorrik's death.
---
This is why we had to stop Balthazar, even though he was taking in the magic (which would solve the issue if the problem was merely magic overload), he could not replace the Elder Dragons in The All (or we had no reason to believe he could).
---
[A dev did hint](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/815609/#Comment_815609) that the solution will be killing Kralkatorrik in the Mists. But that would be not only an asspull as u/102938475-mk2 said, but also a massive misdirection of plot direction occurring for over 2 years and making Aurene's death utterly meaningless. I had expressed my opinion ad nauseam in that thread linked.
---
Idk have you ever played any other MMO or game? Gw2 is pretty good in comparison
---
Now do asuran colleges
---
I have a strong feeling that even if it generates money none of that goes towards wuv wuv.
---
Another of Anet's classical "Let's make a short term shiny solution and ignore the bigger picture" solutions. Seriously, I really, really feel they're close to nailing the coffin.
---
No matter how many times you explain to dense people, they'll never get it so might as well save the energy. 
---
What is it that makes it so difficult for the self-proclailmed "WvWers" to comprehend a very simple statement like: "That's a "problem" in every gamemode..."?
---
Yeah...that's normal. HoT enemies are notoriously more difficult, so much that it's kind of a shock for players who are unaware.
---
You can't just run in screaming anymore and hoping to autoattack them to death, because you will die before you manage to get anywhere.
---
Take a look at your utilities, consider taking some more traits that help keep you alive a little longer if need be, learn to dodge and make use of aegis since you're a guardian.
---
And map meta events are really all that I can tell you in terms of mastery progress. The first masteries are slow because you can't get around the jungle very easily, but after that, map metas are the way to go.
---
go to 1 v 1 server and practice ?
---
on the other hand don't play Fireband until you are regular plat players.
---
it's the hardest spec to play effectively.  most of people just get farmed like necros
---
Uh, okay? But the comment was about why Mesmer gets constant changes.
---
Mid range hammer for Necromancer. Let them use the default Death Shroud so it can actually see the light of day, and give them F2-F4 Order skills that sacrifice health (or Life Force while in shroud) to buff allies. 
---
People isn't being salty, it's called inconformity, and it's natural that it's happening. Anet is at its financial lowest in quite some time. One of the main complains is how they push the development of things that don't really affect the long tearm health and replayability of the game and this is exactly what we're getting.
---
So you want them to start charging us for living world updates or for balance updates, maps and so on? You are not necessarily wrong in what you say but it feels like you are not keeping in mind the different business types companies have.  
---
That will never work for GW2, maybe in a perfect world that is what would happen we would get obtainable armor/ mount skins in game, more balance patches, WVW and PVP maps, living world stories, and they will give you zero reasons to buy things from the store, basically ANet would be a non profit organisation that has people working for them for free.  GW2 has a pretty fair MT system, you can basically play the game at its fullest and never spend $1, you people forget you can change gold for gems it seems, most games that adopt this sort of business plan never offer you to exchange in game currency for MT store.   
---
They need a way to generate profit cause BOX sales are not enough to keep them afloat for 2 years, making a profit to pay your employees and your publisher doesn't make you greedy by default, this is such a big misconception these days.  
---
Not trying to make a case for them cause I agree that the game needs more rewards in the game not just in the gem store but that just doesn't work specially since ANet is not the type of company to put half ass things in the game, they probably rather not put anything instead of having something mediocre at least for the visual side of things. 
---
My only hope at this point is this came from way above the wvw dev and was forced into the game in an attempt to monetize the gamemode with warcat skins &amp; this means further future investment of resources into the mode. I know how unlikely it is, but I haven't totally given up yet. 
---
Some other game has a skill called mimic that blacks some kind of other skill and then reflects it.
---
"Mortals, we've decided to grace you with our presence once again"
---
"Nahhh.. y'all left us to die. We're good, yo"

ive chastised and berated this sub in general a few times in the past, like with their reaction to any WP videos being posted and such...i stopped halfway through with this post too, because i knew this sub is particularly toxic like this and downvote happy so it would never reach the light of day, but i decided to keep going since i was so invested already  
---
  
---
i probably should have taken this to the forums tbh, id have to read up on the rules there to see if this type of post would be allowed
---
Also adding guild stuff for capturing towers etc, giving it a small degree of customizability apart from the guild logo on the banner.  
---
That’s why I made giver’s.
---
What is it that makes it so difficult for the self-proclaimed "PvEr" to comprehend a very simple statement like: "It can always be worse?"
---
I assume they want people to actually play with them, rather than freak out without seeing them in action
---
I hope the warclaw increases travelling speed in WvW - particularly the non EB maps, because it can literally take 1 - 2 minutes just to get back into battle - that's simply an insane amount of time to get back to where you were if you died. As long as there's a cooldown etc. to prevent players easily getting out of combat and escaping being attacked, then it should be fine.
---
I can't wait. It's about time we got something like this.
---
That's kind of my thoughts as well. While it'd be awesome for W5 to get a proper continuation given how poor that was in story and development, W6 ended on such a huge cliffhanger that screamed "more will happen to this plot" while W5 didn't.
---
W5 felt like what ArenaNet did with Joko and Lazarus. Close off the story threads asap so they could get onto newer "more interesting" plots.
---
Well, ~~Lyss~~ Queen Jenna made that forcefield over Divinity's Reach.
---
I made a Blood Legion Female Charr Berserker Warrior named Tampax Bloodflow. I thought it was both RPG/Lore friendly "appropriate" and clever. 
---
Unfortunately, Anet didn't agree and I was forced to change the name! Why?
---
Some random SJW human meta female  (name redacted to protect the cunt but I know who you are) in Divinity's Reach ran up to me once as I logged in to "DR and chill", and said "EWWWW GROSS! REPORTED!!!" and that was that. Goodbye Tampax Bloodflow the Red Berzerker of the Blood Legion! You will be missed. 
---
Apparently, according to the naming policy you can't have names that are trademarks or have something to do with bodily fluids. 
---
For Guardian: Inquisitor (Rifle). Or pistol? I dunno, SOMETHING along the lines of a gun-priest. 
---
I haven't seen this but now i'm curious
---
lmao, blobbing will be prob be stronger since people can get to their blob faster.
---
Haven't played wvw in ages, but I guess the reasons I don't care about it are still issues from the looks of this thread. 
---
* Rewards are slow, tedious, and still not as good as other activities from a time investment standpoint.
---
* No way to get into wvw even if you want to because of general lack of interest.
---
* Blobs and being instantly killed every time there is a fight. Use an ability to try to get away and lag and.... you're dead. I sure love walking for 3 minutes to die instantly and have to walk back. Nah think I'll just leave wvw instead. 
---
* WvW is still primarily PvDoor
---
* Not enough people to do anything meaningful at certain times.
---
* Population imbalances, people moving to winning servers is still a thing???
---
12:00 UTC look for the EVA meta train for HoT starting in TD.  Same time roughly on Sunday for a PoF train.  That one is new and is not guaranteed every Sunday.
---
Try it on some enemies in the Crystal Desert, like Sand Eels, when they're coiling and prepping to lunge at you, or on the Icebrood Wolves in Bitterfrost Frontier, same thing. And then watch them get whipped off your screen to either side
---
Revenant is weird to gear because it has tons of builds for various things, but it doesn’t have a catch-all build that’s good at everything.  ALL of it’s builds are niche.  Balance patch could throw this for a loop soon, but the general builds for Revenant are:
---
Berserker Herald:  Best open world set for self boon buffing, it’s also the most tanky you can reasonably make Renegade.  It’s passable but not exceptional in fractals.  
---
Diviner “Alacrigade” Renegade - Supporty Power build for Fractals. Can work in raids but isn’t popular, pretty poor solo (ironically, even though this build pumps out perms Alacrity, it’s not a very helpful boon for Renegade when solo).
---
Condi Renegade (Viper gear) -  Great in raids, Good solo, Not viable in fractals.
---
Healing Herald + Healing Renegade - neither is very popular across the board, but are viable healers for both fractals and raids.  A variant of Healing Renegade is super OP for a single raid boss.
---
mount good player bad
---
that would be awsome mate!  i dont' know how these things work but i hope it does similar function to the old site
---
Its big, with an arch
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq-wgTWDp7Y By the power 
---
&gt;Balance points better to reward taking keeps or fighting.  Right now, the only way to win is to PPT.
---
That's what WvW is about... fighting for objectives. Objectives give PPT.   
---
There should be NOTHING for just standing in a field trading kills with another side so neither of you come last.
---
I'm not the one who claimed anything about myself. You're the one who has attempted to label me as such, while attempting to ridicule me...all based on blind assumptions.
---
I have merely questioned illogical arguments that are held against the company that some of you claim to despise so much...yet continue using their product.
---
It has also become painfully obvious to me that you are one that is driven by emotion only, rather than logic (but there's more of you). Therefore, it is a wasted effort to have any kind of discussion here with you...when all you can do is attempt to ridicule an out-group member (who you know nothing about) simply because they question your arguments and logic.
---
So, you want class balance (already announced and is coming in addition to mounts), better rewards based on objectives/winning, and server balance.  
---
That’s reasonable and all, but I still don’t see why the community has thrown a fit about the mount as if any work on it is a zero sum game against everything else they want.  I mean, the class balance was announced just hours later and the other stuff requested is more maintenance than feature.  Even improved rewards won’t really take much work unless there’s some unique rewards that are desired.
---
\*I\* explicitly like gliding. It adds an extra dimension towards commitent.
---
Take for example  [Bauer Farmstead](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bauer_Farmstead). There is a long winding path up if you're the attacker.
---
It's very satisfying to watch a small group retreat back down only for you to glide directly across to cut off their retreat.
---
Now, this map was released with gliding in mind, but I'm constantly amazed at the groups that get cut off so easily in situations like this. Gliding was a welcome addition.
---
Mesmers have a long ranged greatsword, so as an elite spec I want a melee longbow please.
---
There are some who play casually who may want mounts but the general reaction both here and elsewhere from WvW players is negative.
---
Desert BL was a poorly structured map for large scale pvp, Anet were told this and ignored the advice.
---
The pip system is a hideous grind, no-one wants that.
---
Server linking was criticized  mainly because we knew at the time that anet had a better option on the table WHICH THEY ARE NOW IMPLEMENTING because surprise surprise the linking system has been a disaster.
---
Every one has had a good reason for being criticised and on the whole the reasons have turned out to be correct.
---
&gt; This is the biggest issue honestly. People want to bitch about how Chrono is OP and mandatory but also don't want to learn it. Of course you're going to be sitting in LFG waiting for a while if you're stubborn and don't pick up the class. 
---
Or maybe they just don't like it? People shouldn't be forced to play a build they don't like to make to make their raids function.
---
No doubt there are some people are who stubborn and won't even try, but if we had a meta where there were a decent number of alternatives to chrono this wouldn't really be a problem. You're not going to change peoples nature on this and I'm not sure that you necessarily should be trying anyway. Changing the game is surely better.
---
I'm guessing evade through enemy lines, dismount, drop Mesmer portal for the rest of the squad. 
---
That’s roughly the time I’m logging off, so a meta train then doesn’t help me much. 
---
Maybe they will if this mount goes well.
---
I don't call them "PvEr"s per se, that was just the suggestion made in the comments above. But this observation rests on the fact that there is a big difference between the type of player that takes WvW seriously versus those that don't take it seriously. 
---
There are heaps of players who take both PvE and WvW seriously. The definition only rests on players invested enough in the game mode and contribute to it long term, versus those that come in for the fun zerg or dailies or what not. 
---
I am not judging any group based on their play style, but there is a big discrepancy in their play style. In terms of the longevity of the mode, there is a type of player which sticks around and contributes long-term, and the rest which don't. You can see it if you decide to recruit for a WvW guild, or play the mode for a long time. Out of the mass of newbies, only a very small amount stay long-term, and they have a very different conception of the mode after they decide to stay and engage with it.
---
Much of this discrepancy is fundamentally down to how player-driven the mode is. Without the players, the veterans, and the ones who play the mode more seriously and maintain the things you see, whether that be supply, upgrades, defending objectives, commanders, roamers, etc.; you don't have WvW as we currently know it. Those less casual players, whom some call "PvErs" (noting this is inaccurate), don't end up contributing to the longevity of the mode, and every event coming around and every update ends up being the same core group playing after the honeymoon period dies down, plus or minus a few players who decide to engage seriously with the mode.
---
1: Yes, it's already been addressed. Balance is not a WvW exclusive problem - it's a game-wide problem and it will always be as such. It's an MMORPG; there's NO PERFECT BALANCE IN MMORPGS...EVER!  
---
2: If I understand you correctly, your argument has now shifted to: ANet, why is the work you claimed you were working on not complete yet? Why are you not giving me what you said you were working on. I do not want what you are giving me now, and instead I would rather wait (while complaining non-stop) for you to give me what you claimed you are working on...which you said will take a long time.  
---
3: Yes, ignore everything I stated following "sPvP". Surely makes your whining relevant.  
---
4: If you think it is so simple to overhaul an engine (lol)...then apply for a job and do it for them. Problem solved, right? Of-course you do not remember a server maintenance in recent time...the servers hardly, if ever, goes down.
---
i’m actually excited for this. even though i am a bit disappointed that alot of the issues wvw players have been asking to be resolved were not addressed, i still see this as a positive. hopefully, it’s just the 1st of many positive changes to wvw. 
---
There is no wvw situation cause there is no wvw :') 
---
We've been saying what we want loud and clear for a while but it seems part of players and most of anet just cover their ears. WvW players disagree in a lot of things but most of your points have been a pretty solid point of agreement that has been mostly ignored. 
---
 i think it's important to take a step back and analyze rotations rather than just following a rotation to the T. it's about knowing your skill priority and the logic behind it. i found that very helpful in learning chrono. (helped also in learning tempest, weaver and DH)
---
We want shark mounts under water with frickin lazer beams!
---
I expect as much when people are driven by emotions and not logic.
---
There's a reason why good leaders and problem solvers are so few in societies, and why they are also, usually the highest paid in workplaces. There are VERY few people who can actually remain calm and assess a situation/argument/problem/decision/etc logically in turbulent times. Humans are emotional creatures.
---
Chrono still exists. Chrono objectively should not exist. Therefore, chrono mains got off easy and should shut up.
---
Darkness for me replaced abyss black.
---
I waited until it was 30 gold to buy when I first wanted it, it was in the hundreds. 
---
Which is why it's a dying genre.
---
Quick ... AB, Teq, Pala, Great Hall, Tangled Depths, Thunderhead (North/South)
---
Long ... Dragon's Stand, takes like 45 minutes but I still like doing it if I have a lot of time.
---
I really like doing Verdant Brink because of the sheer number of events, variety, elevations, and the bosses at the end. Hard to find groups doing it completely unless it's part of the daily. It's still probably my favorite zone.
---
Almost every zone has events/metas. I try hitting others but always seem to come back to the popular ones. I never see much silverwastes activity. There's some metas I still have yet to do due to lack of any players ever .... such as the Desolation.
---
Anything extra trinkets you can grab. I have two apothecary accessories to bring my scourge up to 1.3k toughness.
---
"and probably love"
---
TBH I'm just super disappointed the mount can only carry one player. I still really want a multi person mount like in the concept art! (Also, it feels like we already have a big cat mount with the Griffon, but I guess that's more an aesthetic complaint lol)
---
It's... odd.
---
I can only mention mine as a mostly roam and join with my guild or some pug zergs from time to time to havoc. 
---
What I would really like is better class balance, current meta is firebrand, rev and scourge, and these two overshadow the others so much so that commanders often ask you to swap as they would be helpful. I play 4 classes fairly often, but have to switch to scourge or FB in zergs as I know they would be most helpful. 
---
The other thing which has made me to incline to spvp more is the lag during zerg fights, I play from aus so the ping is already 250+ always, and during zerg fights it's sometimes unbearable. 
---
Frankly, as a reamer I can see how the mount would be a problem as the enemy can get there fast while you're trying to sneak away a camp or can be ambushed by few players very fast, BUT I am actually looking forward to this mount, I'll see how it works out once it comes out.
---
Unless you're a high stealth class.  Thieves are gonna just run through zergs while invisible.
---
The scrapper buff we need
---
1. Go to Snowcrows and see the overall variety of perfectly viable builds for PvE, literally every class has several good builds for people to choose from. Then go to Vabbi builds or whatever site the pugs use nowadays. There is no real variety. Variety only exists in small scale or in GvG and even there it’s no where near as extensive as in PvE. Yeah, great balance right?
---
2. Imagine if the time and money it took to create this mount was instead invested on the alliances. You know, creating content that people have been begging for since the begining instead of making something the majority doesn’t want. OBVIOUSLY people are upset.
---
3. And making a comparison between sPvP and GvG is so revelant right? Hurr durr they are the exact same thing hurr durr. Only further proves my point that you know nothing of either.
---
4. Guess I’ll learn to code. Problem solved then.
---
That too.  Hopefully I die before that one.  
---
My gut instinct is to tell you this game is a bad choice for you. This game isn't really ABOUT end game raids, even though they exist. This game is generally more casual and is more focused on open world content than raid content.
---
In general, raiders complain there aren't enough raids and they don't come out often enough.  My guess is you wouldn't be happy here long term.
---
Well shoot.  We have a ton of OcX/SEA players, hoped it might be a possible answer for you.
---
It's not like GW2 doesn't do this either
---
How many laurels? 
---
I used those for the t6 material for the gift of magic and might.
---
You already have the clovers. So sell the coins for the precursor. 
---
If it's under 400 gold it's cheaper to buy. 
---
I parked my alt characters on nodes that I would need to make gifts. Like rich platinum ore for the gift of battle. It saved me a lot of gold.
---
Look up what materials you will need saved those aside and start liquidating some things for more gold
---
Oh you'll become intimate with core tyria maps more than you want for Gift of Exploration so adding more reasons to go back there won't be a problem.
---
Mounts, I am down, simply because this will be a major change up. for the good or bad I don't care. lol Its just time for big changes. 
---
Honestly, practice. Just keep playing matches, reading your traits, reading your skills, learning about other classes. The more you learn and the more you know what to expect from other classes you are about to go up against will help you in understanding which skills and rotations to use in different fights. And always remember to assess the situation. If you are a warrior and see two Mesmers roaming together, you might think to yourself that you cannot take them both on. So don’t go blindly into a fight you know you won’t win, that only gives the other team 5 more points and your team one less player for 15+ seconds. 
---
You will get the hang of it :) 
---
If it's about RNG rare drops, POF is loaded with them. Infusions, music boxes (still havent gotten a single fucking one), minis that are like 10k gold on TP.
---
"-Likes big guns... and they cannot lie"
---
FTFY
---
And no matter what the changes are, *somebody* will claim it's not a "real" balance patch almost instantly.
---
This. It's really hard to get a good sense of scale on it because you can't get very close to him without dying from the heat. I think there's a trick guardians can do to get right up on him, but I can't remember how since I don't play guardian.
---
It’s like moving servers doesn’t give amer money for a long time already...
---
According to GW2 official Tumblr, yes. However, apparently its skills won't work outside of WvW, so it's probably pretty useless.
---
I mean they'll prob discuss on the official forums so everyone gets banned
---
It can be summoned outside of WvW but a lot of its skills won't function like they do in WvW.
---
If you buy skins they won't use the money to hire more WvW devs to create the content you are looking for.
---
They will have a meeting and say 'look the WvW players bought the mount skins, let's make more mount skins to sell more mount skins to WvW players'.
---
Yup. Always the case.
---
But Scourge and Firebrand are directly counter each other. So what could be changed to give rooms to the other classes? Weavers were made really powerful with meteor shower and people already crying for nerf. Then it got pushed out of the meta...
---
Me when Istan commanders lose their shit about losing 2 mins in Pala map switch 
---
Ok I understand your dissatisfaction with their deciding to add Mounts to WvW over other possible improvements but you are no more able to say that you speak for the majority of the WvW community than anybody else, yes I would have rather something else but I am not dead set against mounts either your blanket statement that only casual players are the only people for them is utterly without merit because one of my guilds for WvW has a large number of its membership that only does WvW on a daily basis and their opinion on mounts, which has been a topic of discussion, is mixed. I'm not disagreeing or disparaging your opinion but implying that majority the WvW community had the same views as yourself was overstating your views as factual. Even if your entire guild had the same views that is no more accurate than if I stated my whole guild was for it there for mounts are a great addition so please lets try to avoid representing personal opinion as fact or anything other than personal opinion.
---
Yeah, I'm still around lol.
---
Tournaments could be a thing once they get the restructure update in place.  At least, that's kind of the feeling I got from them in doing the restructure update to begin with.  There was even mention that GvG support could still be at thing.  Anyways, with the restructure, players and guilds would be a lot more balanced out and could lead to somewhat even match-ups.  Despite there being hope for those that do want them again, I personally don't think it'll happen.  Its a lot of time and resources for Anet which is something they clearly don't want to devote to WvW.
---
Having boons reasonably duplicated but playstyles not be is good MMO design, because it makes it less of a shitfest to find people to play content with.
---
The mount could share hp with you and if it does you die ... kind of like the mastery 
---
I think that you may..
---
Like gw2 for:
---
- pure combat, skill full fighting with the ability to dodge attacks, highly interactive "fights" compared to "cast based".
---
- weapons matter. Wield a sword, and you'll get sword attacks in melee range, equip a secondary longbow, hotswap to it in combat and burst your opponent from a distance (with very limited exceptions as the Mesmer + Great sword or the Thief + Staff combo). 
---
- achievements, they are fun and there are tons of them 
---
- the people, players generally have a healthy attitude towards each other with limited exceptions. 
---
- the mounts. Rather than buying them, you play for XP and Mastery points that you spend to unlock them and upgrade their abilities. (PoF exp needed). 
---
- personal reasons like "I've gotten a lot better" compared to "I'm a lot higher level", you can't buy to win (exception: you can buy PoF to unlock the expansion area where the mounts where added into the game). 
---
- progression in play style, compared to progression in better gear. Also, team comps, and team play compared to higher level caps / higher gear level caps. 
---
- gameplay, the game is in a constant state of change which means that if you take a break at level 80 for 2 months then you come back, your maxed out gear is still viable, but the skills of professions have been rebalanced with new patches so you may find yourself in a state where you have to rethink your play style. This can be confusing but it keeps the game alive and it keeps your play style / gameplay fresh. 
---
- fractals. Fun dungeon styled "fractals" of the "mist". The mists can be described as... kind of like an afterlife / alternate reality / different time period where the environment amongst other things may be... unstable.. 
---
- the lore 
---
- raids are challenging and fun. 
---
-------------------------------------------------------
---
I think you may dislike gw2 for:
---
- instances, the world is not as "seamless" as it is in wow, but it doesn't bother most players. Doesn't bother me, just thought I'd point it out. 
---
- lack of chase for higher gear caps. People tend to work for"cooler" stuff in gw2 compared to "better". Legendary item stats are the same as highest stat non-legendary gear, however legendary allows you to hit swap your stats at any given point while all other gear stats are permanent. 
---
- not having AS much end game as wow. However, end game for a lot of people differ and I think fractals and raids may be in your interest. 
---
- the under water experience. Personally I appreciate it and would like to keep it but I do hate the underwater combat system (but I don't want to get rid of it). 
---
- not having an underwater mount at the current state. 
---
- the need for personal goals and "wants". If there is nothing that you really want to do in the game, there is not much reason to play (which makes sense to many). Some players need linear direction in order to have fun. Gw2 relies on you finding cool things to do a little bit on your own. 
---
- world exploration. If you'd like to make a gen1 legendary. You need 100% core map completion which can be... tedious to many. A surprising amount of people imho seem to not mind tho. 
---
- lack of PvP support from anet (the devs). 
---
- finding people to play with for most content. Although the LFG system is pretty decent compared to other games imo. It's easy to find players to join up with. 
---
- gw2 players can seem less competitive simply because of the loot system. Although it does keep things pretty chill as nobody is really fighting for PVE kills.
---
- not having new gear caps to grind for every now and then. 
---
And.... can't think of other reasons as of why you wouldn't like gw2. Gw2 is a game for everyone, but everyone may not be for gw2. 
---
End game content have rewards for completing runs multiple times. For example: you get A currency for doing Some raid. After B amount of completions of said content, you can afford X item that you may want for various reasons. Hope this helps and hope to see ya in Tyria. 
---
Bloodstone dark violet is amazing. All the blodstone dyes have the most complex hues.
---
&gt; The second ability is Chain Pull and from a WvWer’s standpoint possibly the most exciting of the three abilities. Those on Warclaws will be able to help pull down gates to gain entrance to whatever structure the zerg is currently focused on.
---
From the description, it may not do damage itself, just provide a vulnerability-style debuff to the gates so they take more damage from rams, etc.
---
This is a lot of salty zerg vs. zerg nonsense. PUGing a raid where everyone plays a special snowflake build is as fun and easy as eating live hornets while on fire.
---
Also, half the point of that mode is you can just bring more people. Fights aren't forced to be fair like PVP.
---
According to this sub, gliders were already somethîng "no one" asked for that killed the game mode anyway so I dont see whats the big deal now 
---
There's a mode where you can have fair fights against other players without gear or buff advantages...
---
-	Fixed a server crash.
---
As someone who does WvW everyday, I think the mount looks really fun too. I am looking forward to trying it out and seeing how it compare to other siege and what it's limitations are. 
---
My favorite is scepter/warhorn Fresh Air Auramancer. It’s not as high damage but it has decent sustain for open world stuff and is fun to play meta events with. 
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest_-_Fresh_Air_Auramancer
---
The rest of the game has mounts.  WvW doesn't.  Walking slow sucks.  Maybe more people will give WvW a chance if they didn't have to walk around everywhere.  
---
Also, it might be nice to not have to rely on putting a swiftness move in every build we make.
---
Always with the spies xD
---
Doubt this will even harm the gamemode. Might not be the addition wvw players want, but as someone who enjoys fights I welcome it. 
---
Same with the desert borderlands map, but I don't see many mentions of that one either.
---
Yeah I guess you’re right about that. I imagine a lot of guilds would still do regular guild raids though or even go open tag every now then.
---
Thanks.
---
honestly never encountered anything remotely close to that :O I mean woahh I can understand part of the frustration now. Are you sure though it's anet fault and not some los packet on it's way due to your internet provider mili second shortage or smth like that ?
---
Something with rifle. It saddens me that only 3 classes can use it currently. I dunno if you can ever count Warrior rifle because it sucks so much ass. 
---
I wouldn't mind an endless horde of bags.
---
• You can buy the precursor with mystic coins from other players, it saves you the TP fines and you could get lucky and get when cheaper than the current buy price, check r/Gw2Exchange 
---
• You can buy the map reward boost from Pact Supply Network Agent (PSNA) for around 5k karma and use it in the map that have the priciest matt as a reward currently its the totems in frostforge sounds, you can buy six of these each day 
---
• RIBA is very much well and I think even better if you intend to grind for more than 30 min, Istan got nerfed and now you can only open 30 chests in Palawadan and 12 in The great hall  
---
Me when someone doesn't stack at Matriarch and people lose their mind.
---
Gating works for awhile.  When I played EVE supers were very uncommon and so were titans; it was a battlecruiser game and the devs were trying to push everyone towards small gang frigate fights.
---
If your mission runners keep pulling in isk and your farmers keep pulling in resources and that's all they do (and all the PVE there is to do - EVE PVE is.... unambitious) then it's going to start to add up after awhile.  The first ships to come online are a huge investment but after the skills are maxxed out, after the supply lines are secured, after the manufacturing capacity is built out.... what is an alliance going to do?  *Not* build ships?
---
I guess the GW2 equivalent is ascended armor.  You can play till your keyboard falls off but you can't make more than one of each of the four account-bound materials per day, and it takes about a month to get enough mats for a suit of armor.  It also takes a maxed out crafting profession, which is *very* expensive if you're new to the game.  Your first set of ascended gear feels like it takes forever.  Your tenth?  Not so much.  You mine a few of the LWS3 maps daily or you're at storage cap so you can buy trinkets easily; you've run enough fractals to have a few boxes of armor and maybe a weapon; you've done enough PVP and WvW to be able to buy trinkets or weapons or armor; you've got guild missions and laurels to cover core stats if you're going for a power build.  That ~200g you spent boosting crafting professions on several characters has been earned back several times over, and now you're in a position where you can use those professions sparingly to fill in the gaps of a new character's gear.
---
Gating just lengthens the on ramp - once you're on the highway you don't have to slog up it again.
---
I feel like they were called Seige raiser and Seige crusher. One was to take back your spawn tower on an enemy BL. The other was to try and take a keep once you had your tower. Or maybe it was to help defend it? I can't remember and I can't find any mention on the wiki, strangely enough.
---
Melee is a little more challenging than ranged, and it's important to evade and retreat when necessary. I'd rather take a lap around the block than get downed.
---
The mount is doing something I feel is needed. Its basically a siege tool and bunker buster. It will get your group past terrible choke points and into the fight which is needed badly.
---
Honestly, I lead Istan for almost a year, but those 2 mins can be the difference of 4-5 gold.
---
However, it’s nothing to rage about which I see a lot of people doing. 
---
What I really want is to be able to dismount enemy who tries to run back to his zerg with my own mount. That can be cool and rewarding if you pull it off. And then it's me or him!
---
Reoccurring Insecurity died in silence, RIP
---
*What* tome nerf?
---
maybe some sort of civil war bobblehead thing?
---
WvW needs all the whining and disgruntled veterans quitting the game and a large influx of fresh blood.
---
Indeed, it is quite the majestic goat-cat. I'm mostly curious about what its movement mechanic will be.
---
*removed torment
---
*Added same number of burn to skills as trade off
---
I don't really care if it gives players as much mobility as mounts do in pve. Easily surmounted by having it dismount in combat by a player. Faster movement = faster supply of bags.
---
^(I like the mount...)
---
That's the plan. From what I've seen so far, in unorganized pugs it's better to forsake any idea of true meta rotation and focus more on surviving, almost like if it was dark souls. Nailing a few hits and backing up to safety, learning not to overextend. With time I hope to learn how to maximize the damage in each opening.
---
It's just that when I see holos or reapers landing strong bursts while I'm running around evading deadly shit I get anxious and end up overextending.
---
This screenshot meta is getting insane ...
---
Yeah my questions are more like if he went through the trouble of cropping this cell phone picture of his monitor (is it not?) then why not crop Mr civil war here. Also, I don't see an easy to define monitor border so my perspective is just confused.
---
If there is disconnect its between wvw players and reality.
---
If I ever have to do DS meta again for gear I will drill my own brains out
---
Don't you dare just hold down Shift, either.
---
If it acts as in PvE, the mount will eliminate randomly getting 1 shot from an invis thief while traveling between points. And if you know the thief is around just get on the mount if out of combat and no getting 1 shot. 
---
I main a thief (daredevil) and and nothing worse then knowing a deadeye was around, and nothing you can do but wait. I’ve seen a deadeye camping EBG keep entrance solo (hacking) where there was nothing you could do but try to outrun them, but a free buffer from mount should eliminate the 1 shot. 
---
ACs + cata + treb behind gate = strategy. Why do people even play wvw like it's an RTS game...
---
This post made me realize that I haven't used regular shroud in over 3 years, and I'm pretty sure I don't actually know what the skills do anymore anyways...
---
Mid range ugggghhhh, hammer ugghhhhhhhhh. You realise necromancer is the only profession which doesn't have access to sword weapon right?
---
Is this bait?
---
The reality being that they aren't the target demographic of the game and can't be effectively monetised? That's partially true. After so many years it should be time to let go, but somehow some players are still sticking around, which shows how much potential the mode could have had. The combat system and game mode is still pretty unique in view of the current MMO offerings.
---
10 minutes? Try doing that for 2 hours on tier 3 keeps as they glide back inside with supply from an entirely different borderland to spam repair the walls...
---
But wait, there's less!
---
There could be a decent level of history of people either wanting or expecting something (mounts in WvW), and there will **still** be a narrative of "No one asked for this!"
---
Rock, meet hard place.
---
In summary: Who needs patience? We can complain about it before we've even seen it!
---
Well when you put it that way it doesn't sound half bad! 😂
---

*me to myself via sticky notes:* never become a game developer
---
the lightmap was an experimental feature added in gw2hook, and then later taken away because 1) nobody found a good use for it, and 2) it was buggy. as such, it has nothing to do with what the OP is seeing.
---
otherwise, this appears to be an issue exclusive to the OP, since this isn't seen for both gw2hook and reshade.
---
Wise choice. Another BfA refugee. Welcome aboard.
---
&gt;  How do you feel about gems?
---
gems are great for QoL upgrades; 
---
- extra character slots; 
---
- unbreakable tools; 
---
- shared inventory slots, 
---
- extra bank tabs.
---
- copperfed salvage-o-matic
---
don't get it for skins or for other vanity items; those can come later; convenience will improve your enjoyment of the game more than a few skins will; you've got so many to unlock in GW2. 
---
What? Pistols are pretty crazy on engineer, it's every other part of their condi builds that are sucky.
---
It is indeed. Fun and very useful. What happen is, if you have the expansions, it is clearly better (by power creep) the chrono and the mirage. This is where balance should come to play. 
---
It looks like the [new WvW mount](/r/Guildwars2/comments/asdn1o/guild_wars_2_wvw_mount_the_warclaw_announced/) may help make taking keeps, or at least breaking down the doors quickly, easier.
---
Is matrial tavern the one in VB? Does it drop an infusion?!
---
What about Olmakhan? They're not a legion but they're still a group.
---
It says "mount available exclusively *through* wvw", not *in* wvw. Should we have any hope we can play it in pve ?
---
Really well done Meta. I do it every chance I get.
---
Will this be like  amount for everyone thing or craft or earn mount after certain levels?
---
I'll be lurkin don't ya worry
---
Got into an argument with a guy earlier who basically said he's never buying anything GW2 related anymore due to this update.  I asked why he wants to keep playing when he just seemed to have mostly problems to list about the game, to which he gave the "oh so heres this arguement of, if you don't like it dont play it.."
---
Well yeah, I mean if you don't like where a game is going, why are you continuing to play and make yourself miserable?  Some of the players in this game are asinine.  
---
It actually is locked behind PoF, it's specified in the mmogames article.
---
Armor skins, costumes, weapon skins, salvage-o-matic, glider skins, elite specs, server transfers - WvW has always had monetization components, pretty much the same as the rest of the game (plus the addition of server transfers for WvW guilds that server hop every other reshuffle).
---
Mounts actually bring a couple desired things for WvW. For one, lots of people wanted to use mounts in WvW - they are genuinely fun to ride and being able to do that in WvW is cool. It's something uniquely special to WvW - you will earn it in WvW then take it back to PvE, but it's a special feature from WvW and that's cool for WvW. The increased movement in WvW will be greatly appreciated by people who have low mobility. All those scourges running back to the zerg won't have much longer res runs than a daredevil etc.
---
There is also the possibility that the mount's siege abilities have genuinely interesting interactions with sieging a structure. There will be the ability to use counter siege (abilities on things like ACs and cannons which dismount, or upgrades to treb poisons that dismount etc), the ability to design tricks and traps which dismount, and there may even be some ways the mount can interact with gates or possibly walls (maybe requiring the consumption of supply) so everyone doesn't just stand around sieging a structure.
---
If the vocal WvW community wasn't so ideological averse to any kind of feature that doesn't 100% perfectly match what's already in their limited head space of what they want (usually some nebulous concept of how GvG/fights should work, often to the detriment for the rest of the game mode as it was designed) there might be some space for this announcement to be genuinely, positively received by almost everyone.
---
AFAIK you don't need HoT to glide in WvW.
---
the PoF one is very useful for non pve er
---
it gives a key to port to expansion area without having to do the story quest.
---
They will almost certainly turn that off in WvW like the down skill 5 was turned off.
---
That's a good point, gonna be difficult to ambush players if they are on mounts.
---
yes but what I want is mount engage skill to be able to dismount other enemy if you land it :)
---
Technically owning PoF will make WvW pay2win compared yo non PoF players
---
I've been a dedicated WvW player since late 2012 in everyone from T1 zerg guilds, roaming guilds, small ops guilds, casual GvG guilds and as a pug zerg player.

Nothing about this mount seems out of touch with what WvW is in my experience - faster movement out of combat will be a fantastic addition to players like me. I love it. A new way to interact with sieging a structure beyond PvDoor - fine, doesn't break anything and gives me something to do. I like it.
---
Sure it won't do anything for GvG (nothing will, those people are so deep in the salt mine of denial they can't be reached anymore) and it doesn't have good compatability with open field fights (can't mount in combat, can't prebuff on mounts etc) but that's fine - open field combat doesn't want a mount for combat and this mount isn't designed for combat.
---
The only complaint I've seen about the mount that appears relevant to me is the issue with FPS and adding a whole zerg of mounts to render. I trust ArenaNet to handle that problem - they do a better job than ESO and BDO.
---
This is what I run as well. Note that the build is a glass cannon, and even with all of the block you might down from time to time.
---
Darkness is the absolute best.
---
This isn't the problems that every pvp game has, this is being more or less abandoned. WvW has almost no resources assigned to it, it takes literal years for them to update it, bugs and issues are left addressed for years as well. I play a lot of pvp oriented games... You can't even begin to compare the state of WvW to any healthy pvp game. It's been a mode bleeding out for years now, it's so far from healthy... So much of the population is gone, so many guilds dead, so many servers shallow husks of their former selves. What it needs more than anything is continued and regular support. People need to know that Anet cares about the modes future and is making regular updates focused on improving it. That alone would do wonders. The thing is.... Everyone knows pvp and wvw are basically dead modes on life support, and thats not likely to change. Without the prospect of change, the player count continues to bleed.
---
Yeah, I don't understand. Outside of the rare (and pretty cheap) expansion pack, Anet keeps giving us content for free. They've done this for several years mainly via monetized cosmetics. Why is this suddenly going to change?
---
This will ruin roaming.
---
It seems unlikely the mount will be better than a ram.  Why have a ram which requires supply to build if a mount is better? It seems very likely the mount will be better than PvDooring but weaker than ramming. Basically something for the rest of the zerg to do while waiting for a gate to go down.
---
If the mount is any level of strong against objectives, it seems really simple to design another tier of siege masteries which dismounts players when hit. That will allow even a single person to easily shutdown mounted sieges.
---
Keep in mind the introduction of a mount means they have created design space for counterplay.
---
For zerg play you can finish weaver and go with staff. You can also roam with him (needs different stats though, and another weaponset).
---
Guard and Rev can both be played in a zerg (support Firebrand/dps Rev) and as decent roamers.
---
The other classes you mentioned are better for roaming, as ranger in zergs is.. Useless. Engi can be a heal scrapper for zergs (inferior to Firebrand in aegis/stability support) and as holo in gvg setups. 
---
Get good is a fallacy. Were talking about a group of people who have no reason to take your advice whatsoever, and most likely will not. So you can keep saying get good, but they can keep ignoring you and leaving. 
---
Narrator: He quit 3 WvW days later and found an open AB map. 
---
There is a balance patch next week and the alliance update has been in development for around a year now (it will likely be the single biggest update to a fundamental system the game has ever received and it was built solely for WvW - they aren't delaying it out of spite). Any WvW player who genuinely identifies with this meme needs a pacifier and their nappy changed.
---
Balance patch will be here next week, new elite specs will come with the next expansion, the alliance system (which is a huge amount of work) is on its way, meanwhile the mount team (which is not the WvW team) have come up with a fun new toy for the game mode.
---
The mental gymnastics vocal WvW complainers must go through to want both everything and nothing at the same time is exhausting and pointless.
---
If only i could have a number next to Conquer the Creator achievement. Nothing makes me pull out a 1 shot build like seeing a dev pug zerging around.  
---
I mean it's something, instead of the mostly nothing wvw has been getting for years?
---
this cannot be stated strongly enough.  In WoW, at least in the last two/three expansions, gear has been so temporary that I challenge most raiders to name even ONE item they are wearing that isn't a trinket or artifact.  Goodness knows I couldn't.  WoW gear is tossed and replaced so often that you have no attachment, no sense of achievement because you know you could get an epic, titanforged BIS (for now) drop from a world quest tomorrow and replace your mythic raid gear with a normal dungeon drop if you're lucky.
---
Gw2, because they don't have you replace your whole set of gear as often, lets you *invest* in your items.  Building a set of exotics is cheap and easy, but getting a full set of ascended can take time (especially if you want one of the harder stat sets like Vipers).  Because you're not tossing it again in a few months, that path to good gear can be a *journey*, not just a rando drop from a rando quest that you've already forgotten about.
---
I can tell you every item I have on my gw2 chars, because it took effort to earn each and every one.
---
Level your revenant and unlock herald. I think taking your first steps in a zerg with weaver will not be fun. 
---
Your other classes are fine for roaming. 
---
&gt; So you can keep saying get good, but they can keep ignoring you and leaving.
---
then they should leave.
---
i don't want an endless stream of stupid lemmings to farm. i want to fight other players who are willing and able to fight, in open field, while attacking objects, while defending... doesn't matter.
---
the best way to improve WvW isn't to make it any more accessible - it's already accessible enough. the best way to improve WvW is make it a more compelling experience for the right kind of players to stick around: those who want to play large-scale, objective-based PvP.
---
They did gliding well enough that I don't assume the mount will be too broken. I assume most of the siege utility will cost supply, for example.
---
I agree they need to generate profit.  The question is whether they are delivering content meant to enrich shareholders or players.
---
I think it comes down to this for me: I have a deep affection for the game, the lore, the story, and the aesthetics.  I’d hate to see it shut down.  
---
But what happens when all we get are gem store outfits month after month?  What happens when people are finally fed up, frustrated, and walk away from the game due to poor balancing, drought of content, or stale game modes?  Yeah, some of the outfits are nice, but is that enough to keep people playing?  Fractals are a good example as the recent “improvements” to instabilities have made things a lot worse and a headache to deal with.  PvP is a veritable salt mine where I’ve experienced more harassment from my teammates than the opposing team.
---
It’s a two-way street; users want to enjoy a product and if that product stops being enjoyable they leave.  Revenue streams dry up.
---
Gem store outfits and QoL items can’t save the game.  I want to support the game, but if I can’t be sure they are going to provide updates and content I want, then there is little incentive to invest my money into digital goods that will simply vanish as if they had never existed.
---
I don’t have all the answers.  But, as we’re doing now, I’m trying to create a dialogue to see if there could be a better way.  And it’s quite possible there may not be.  Or it could simply be that Guild Wars has gone in a direction that isn’t meant to appeal to me.  
---
If so, then it will be a bittersweet goodbye, like watching the Diablo franchise lose its soul or watching BioWare, one of my favorite developers when I was younger, slowly crumble because they decided it was better to take orders from people who don’t even like games.
---
PS.  If you think they don’t care about visuals take a look at the T3 cultural weapons in Divinity’s Reach.  Those skins could use a major retexture.  Those are the worst offenders but there are other examples.  I would love a retexture update but also understand that will never happen as it is not a priority or probably even considered anymore.
---
They cant Put this in without any patching. Or at least shouldn't. The probability that this would cause a shitshow would bei top high.
---
With scourge you can’t go wrong. Mandatory in zergs and easy to play with a lot of Xp attribution potential.
---
Not holding my breath that much. Their "explanation" sometimes doesn't make much sense to uninitiated. "We felt that it was too strong" -- there, an explanation for you. It probably won't change how you or I feel (that healing in PvE is now more difficult because of large cooldown once you've used the pages), and most likely won't reveal _everything_ (something akin to "guard healers outperformed druids so much that people started switching en masse and we want to keep them spread out"). Plus forward looking statements... (when they nuked boonshare from high orbit)
---
Okay neat thanks!
---
That's true, they could have other things in the works that haven't been revealed yet. Or potentially the mounts could be their answer to fixing the problems with siege or combat balance. Still, it's hard to believe that would be the case. Difficult to give them the benefit of the doubt after the past disappointments.
---
I'm already into WvW and I like the mount. Mounts are fun to ride in GW2 - they are more than just a speed boost. While I don't expect much (if any) platforming for the mounts in WvW, I am excited to travel around more quickly on slower classes like the scourge.
---
I think things like swiftness, superspeed and skills like ancestral grace are well designed for combat mobility, but sharing that design space with out of combat mobility is a burden that unevenly falls across professions. I think people overvalue a theif's mobility when roaming a map when they complain mounts would kill that advantage (skill based mobility is primarily most useful in combat and that will remain an advantage for these classes even with mounts - thieves can outpace most mounts even in PvE when they commit to it).
---
Mounts in PvE have taught me that the game is simply more fun when out of combat mobility is normalized. I still value my in combat mobility on professions that have it, but the slower classes or builds feel so much better when my raptor of griffon do all the work.
---
but with less anime
---
Actually, not all blinks work and you can't do any of those on mount.
---
I've interrupted every single thief shadowstep stomp with static field (the 2nd part of shadowstep utility skill). I also think that mesmer's staff 2 can be interrupted the same way (maybe even other blinks on all classes) when caught inside static field.
---
I think what I miss nowadays mostly is the Dev activity on this reddit. If anything new was released, or was announced and reddit topics started to come with a lot of (sometimes very fair) questions.. The Devs would be there instantly you know. It is extra work for them (most likely), but it was one thing that was in my opinion brilliant of GW2. The line between the Devs and us as community was very, very short. Since that new marketing guy arrived, I have the idea that this pretty much stopped.
---
I thought it was pretty much understood that meaty changes to WvW itself won't happen until Alliances are out and if they still don't happen then they never will.
---
I just hope it won't be too much of a grind/hassle to unlock. I'm not a WvW player and I don't want to spend too much time in a game mode I'm very bad at for that. :P
---
On the subject of the mount itself, I'm a bit bummed it looks like a griffon reskin sans wing. While visually impressive, it doesn't feel distinctive *in motion*. 
---
I'm also worried this is the last presumed mount aforementioned in the living story interview last August. Since we don't know if LS5 will add more, as the "ultimate final mount" it feels a bit meh, especially when [the remnants of a multipeople rhino mounts](https://i.imgur.com/iIUjawo.jpg) were in the game's files not too long ago. This one would have actually felt unique and distinctive.
---
I like it anyhow, for what it is and what it offers. :-)
---
Yes I see. Why does a nomal question gets downvoted? Fuck these ppl here, bunch of incel kids in their parents basements.
---
I haven't played gw2 in like 3 years cause nothing they do interests me at all its like wtf do you know what a video game is is it that hard to do something fun with your game like holy shit but this has me slightly interested only slightly which is better than the literal nothing I feel for every other thing that comes out of this game.
---
&gt; there's a fix for that already: git guud. don't be dumb. if you make a mistake, then you should be punished. that 3-5 minute run should give you ample time to figure out what you did wrong and avoid it in the future.
---
That's going to attract lots of players and save your dying game mode for sure! Just never die in a pvp mode, why didn't they think of that?
---
Pve masteries have nothing to do with wvw. There's no stealth gliding in wvw for example. 
---
That what people said about BfA, oops
---
&gt;*Don't you have mounts?*

Didn't really answer the question, but okay.
---
That's them leaving Tyria, not the reason why they left their realms. They left Tyria 1332 years ago, but only left their own realms a few years back (with kormir being the last to leave hers in 1330) and them leaving their own realms is what I was talking about
---
You sir or madam are the voice of reason. Thank you for being the one person in here that's neutral on the front xD
---
&gt;If your other healer is NOT a Druid, water spirit becomes BIS
---
I do not follow. The vast majority of other healers also apply regeneration, making water spirit very redundant and potentially harmful. I can understand if it's a Scourge (who has barriers and very little regen) or a heal Renegade (who has no regeneration unless traited for it, which also reduce its healing), but if it's a Firebrand, Tempest, or Engi, then they already apply their own regen. And they likely do it stronger than druid, meaning their regen takes priority, meaning water spirit becomes even more redundant, not to mention the regen from Healing Spring is stronger. 
---
Yeah, Wildstar had that same idea, focus on appealing to the hardcore players. Then it crashed &amp; burned spectacularly. If you disregard the more casual players you are just shooting yourself in the foot. 
---
You say you don't want hard core yet you don't care about negative reinforcement loops and highly skilled PvP content without any new or experienced players. Sorry, but your fitting the definition of hard core content. You even started with "Get good", a comment constantly associated with hard core content. 
---
All this aside your vision for WvW is incompatible with far too many players. Not just new and inexperienced players too. I myself being someone who has placed thousands of hours into WvW would say one of the worst problems is the long walk back. If mounts can speed it up it would make WvW far more enjoyable for everyone. 
---
i can only compare to wow vanilla raids, and compared to that raids in gw2 are way easier. most fights are carried be 2-3 people while the rest simply does dps (the so called dps checks in this game are rather laughable). that aside, it also rather fast to get your weekly kills, if you are in an exp group. you can clear ALL raid bosses in about 4hours.
---
 to be completly honest with you, i quit gw2 a few month ago after 2,5 years. if it wasn´t for my guild mates i would have quit long before that, the "new content delivery" regarding raids is super slow sadly. 9 month between releases of 2-4 new bosses that get cleared in 4 hours after release is way to little. there is also fractal challenge mode though, wich is fun, but there are just 2 of it. keep in mind that you probaply will run those things in already BIS gear and so you won´t get rewarded other than in skins and liquid gold. in short, its a good game, but sadly as a "classic endgame progression" - player you are in a tiny minority spot and anet will let you know that.
---
Pretty much this. Yet veteran players wonder why "nobody" plays their game mode lol.
---
&gt; Still I will buy the WvW mount skins, because I want to support the game mode and hope that the profits are used to hire more devs to work on WvW
---
It won't. It will only go to more "content" designed to push you in the direction of microtransactions. You've known this, and if you didn't then you sure do now. 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; i want the game mode to have a more compelling experience for the right kind of players to stick around. i DON'T want the game mode to cater to every random scrub just to fill some arbitrary population cap.
---
If you want large group pvp, you need large groups. Getting more people is not arbitrary. If you don't want large group pvp, well, spvp exists I guess?
---
&gt; while I discovered you can upgrade for about $25 (guessing) to deluxe edition, which would grant you access to the 
---
ok, so in the context of this post, does that make the 'ultimate' edition a good buy?
---
i just bought a 'new' copy of HoT on ebay, so hoping that turns out ok. ($12)

It's a picture taken with my Phone indeed.

The character below my screen is a puppet of Lemmy Kilmister, frontman of Motorhead.
---
Since i have a 34" inch widescreen there really wasnt any use of showing my whole screen, and you would berely see my Asura. 
---
One thing to keep in mind is the veterans are a double edged sword in games like this. Yes, they know the mechanics inside and out and likely know how the game is balanced even better than the developers in many cases. But the flip side is they are also often out of touch with the new player experience, or the experience for people that are playing non meta builds, etc.
---
If you only listen to the vets, you risk alienating a potential new player, or discouraging players that don't follow the current meta from participating. I've known many vets that only look at the current meta in games and ignore or even outright discourage play styles that don't fit in with their established ideas. Sometimes to keep a game healthy you have to mix it up a bit and try new ideas. 
---
But then again, you have to be careful that your new idea or changes don't destroy the game that the players you already have love to play (Anybody remember the NGE in Star Wars Galaxies:P).
---
Really there is no easy answer, I have seen games die because they listen to their vets just as easily as I've seen a game die for ignoring their vets. Only thing I've really seen hold true over time is that you don't want to make large changes to the core gameplay of an older game. That is the sure fire way to drive off players regardless of if they are new or old.
---
You can make vegan food, i can teach you to cook.
---
Yes. Not in the same week.
---
Not so risky as reddit is full of pvers. They definitely love the idea of having a new mount! 
---
I cook vegan food for you at home 
---
I can help!
---
No where did I mention "large group PvP". Large scale PvP encompasses both large groups as well as multiple smaller encounters throughout the map.
---
Only one of those require a large group of people, and it doesn't even need that many people.
---
That's the problem of it, it takes too long to find enemies and too long to respawn since the map is enormous. 
---
Mount cant help much with that because  
---
1) there's already classes with high mobility (and it still takes a long time to get back to fighting spot)  
---
2) if they make mount too fast it will essentially break everything, related to both combat and lag.
---
The only helpful part would be keeping necros safer ooc because they are slow af and helping smaller groups take down objectives sligtly easier due to skill 2.
---
Not everybody is negative. But some Tyrians talk more than others. And I believe they're more afraid than negative. Let's wait and see if this mount is made for WvW casuals or if the way to unlock it will ask for a big invest. Let's wait and see if it's well balanced too. Until now, I can't figure a roamer without this mount meeting somebody mounted... Completely unfair fight ? And what if it's not available for core game ? 
---
See you next week for answers :-)
---
Also chairs are actually mounts in game
---
it also motivates you to farm the gear in the first place. I never felt motivated to grind gear in WoW, because why would I when it's going to be worthless the moment the new patch drops
---
And you only scratched the surface; think on that: fast patroling blobs---&gt; end of roaming.
---
It's a photo taken with my Phone, no cropping anything.

I have a 34" widescreen monitor, so if i would show all of my monitor you'll get e very big picture, with a tiny Asura. This way my Asura is the middle point of attention.

The character below is lemmy kilmister, frontman of Motorhead.
---
Lemmy is always worth showing
---
Ok that makes sense xD
---
The other part of wvw community is too busy karma training.
---
I thought it's easy enough to deduce if it's called a "mount" and is usable in PvE it's going to be as any other mount we have in PvE, but usable in WvW.
---
For sure not ;-) But it really makes me think this mount is a Nian. 
---
You and Anet are missing a fundamental understanding in marketing.   Doesn't matter how nice the shiny mount is if there are no customers left playing the game to buy it.  This will cost them a lot more money than it will make 
---
This one time, in siege camp... 
---
It's a private area on the map, which you need the key to enter. You use the key to teleport there, which is how you can get characters to the POF maps without needing to do the story quests. 
---
You can only get the key from deluxe edition. 
---
I as a Tyrian am unfamiliar with the four legged mammal you refer to as "horse". Could you elaborate on this fascinating alien creature?
---
The entire reason why it is having divided responses is because WvW as it is ALREADY HAS ISSUES YET TO BE FIXED.
---
And they are not addressing them but throwing in new things to the mix.
---
This worries alot of WvW players because they are afraid that balance will be thrown right out the window and the game mode would be near unplayable for at least a week for devs to balance that shyt.
---
Sounds like your bf tosses his clovers into your mystic forge 😜
---
All reasonable ones stopped playing GW2 long ago
---
Regarding the map rewards, there is a detailed list for when/where to use the PSNA boosts on the wiki. Check [Map Rewards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Map_bonus_reward/profit).
---
You're stupid
---
Just in case anybody hadn't caught on
---
Welcome back ;D
---
I know it says available exclusively through wvw, but does that mean it’s only usable in wvw? Iwanna ride my battle kitty in open world.
---
It's an old Skritt legend. Not the sort of thing the Dredge would tell you. 
---
"Debacle" is a bit of a strong way to say people are apprehensive. 
---
Grats. I just started playing a couple of weeks ago and I can't wait to get my first legendary weapon.
---
There's a vast difference between "dying in one second" and "hardcore", but I guess I'm just asking for too much nuance.
---
&gt;I myself being someone who has placed thousands of hours into WvW would say one of the worst problems is the long walk back
---
If you've played that many hours and this is still a problem for you, then you really should git guud. I expect someone with that many hours played to be one of the last to die, and walking back to be a non-issue because the commander is respawning with you.
---
Owning GW2 already makes it p2w versus non-gw2 players.  
---
Owning HoT already makes it p2w versus base-game gw2 players with no access no specializations. 
---
I think you don’t know what p2w means. 
---
To be fair, you’re talking averages. You can’t claim that the dumbest asura is smarter than the smartest sylvari, that’s just silly. 
---
&gt;You're stupid
---
&gt;Just in case anybody hadn't caught on
---
Right back at you.
---
There's no shame in fighting at range for those two bosses. No one ever says, while lying dead on the ground, that the thief bouncing around solo Unloading for the last 30% of the gladiators health, really should be in melee more. 
---
But...let's say you get a GvG arenas where guilds from every server can meet and fight with WvW skill balancing. This would obviously be outside of WvW. Are you at that point even a WvW player anymore? :thonking:
---
I can understand your frustration, but I disagree with you about monetizing cosmetic skins.  
---
Growing up my folks had a combined salary of less than $35k with a family of four kids, me included.  I've worked fast food, I've worked manufacturing, I've worked retail jobs.  After college and law school, I'm now earning 90k a year just myself.
---
How much have a spent on the gemstore since I started playing back in early access in 2012?  At most, $80 in those 6+ years.  I think the only cosmetic I bought was the aetherblade outfit and the rapier.  Other than that, just gems for bag space and for the endless gathering tools.  I really wanted to get Majorie's latest outfit, but I decided not to get it.  I've never felt any immense pressure that I absolutely MUST purchase gems to buy something for GW2.
---
I think monetizing is okay because 1) I'm not paying a sub fee and 2) it's not for stat enhancing gear.  
---
If you want to talk about preying on gambling addiction you need to check out how bad mobile gatcha type games are.  I play Clash Royale every now and then and I refuse to spend money to purchase a chance to get better unit cards, whereas someone in my clan dropped $200 bucks on rngesus.  Then there's F2P rpgs that extremely limit your bag space or the pay 2 win rpgs that actually let you purchase stat enhancing gear.
---
That's not to say: oh just because GW2 is tiny bit better that makes it right.  I just disagree with you, **I don't believe that the selling of cosmetics is preventing Anet from producing meaningful content.**  Designing skins, or the more lazy "outfits" has no impact on the writing of the story, nor do I think they shift WvW or sPvP devs onto the "cosmetic" group and it's not like they're throwing out skins every single week.
---
Here's why I don't think skins are a detriment.  If their goal was to try and fleece repeated financial transactions post initial product/expac sale, anet would need to create a product that compels people to keep playing.  If the game sucked, no one would play, if no one plays, no one buys the cosmetics.  Otherwise, how do you keep people playing if the game sucks?  Introducing a p2w mechanic so you got those assholes that enjoy feeling empowered buying gear.  And ever since ascended tier around year one or two, there hasn't been any gear upgrade introduced.
---
I'm completely with you in that I don't think you should pay money if you don't think a product is worth supporting.  Frankly, if the content is no longer appealing to you, you should just stop playing.  I stopped at A Bug in the System, and have been more actively playing FFXIV since Stormblood is released.
---
Lava Font never forget
---
I don't think it's that. The map is just huge and it takes too long to find opposite zerg or just to get to objectives. On top of that there's not many good fighting spots where you dont get screwed by terrain.
---
It's the only map that actually needs a mount (or permanent shrine travels), but if you make mount too fast then other maps become very trivial. If you make mount slightly faster than swiftness then it's still slower than swiftness+mobility skills and you're still moving relatively slowly compared to other maps.
---
From what I see they cant make mount so it doesn't break anything and it acts as a helpful traveling tool at the same time, but I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens. It just seems like a good monetization move as well as a way to bring some fresh blood to wvw because guilds are dying and without guilds wvw turns into open world pve.
---
I would love to see more mace wielding classes. Currently we only have warrior, revenant and guardian all being heavy armor specs. 
---
I was thinking like a defensive ele spec or a ranger with a viking vibe. 
---
had a look and i have to disagree, the warclaw seems more like a charr ancestor the a nian (tho i don't doubt they'll add a nian skin later)
---
I never said it was a problem for me. It's a problem of the mode.
---
It happens frequently with large 3 way fights, and even some of the larger 2 way ones.
---
Definitely not an ISP issue. This has been going on for years.
---
Join groups that indicate there 
---
Chrono/druid
---
Ren/FB/
---
Chrono/sb/warrior(id only join this comp if its cm group) 
---
Or even 
---
Chrono/healer
---
FB/warriors/sb
---
Can be okey. 
---
If it doesn’t dit one of those categories its probably going to be a nightmare and you will have to take something like invigorating precision to stay alive. 
---
For the best chance at decent groups start building up your CM KP until you can join no healer groups there. 
---
But then you get the EotM situation where mass capping as many objectives as possible per hour is the most rewarding way of play, causing zergs to ignore each other. And good luck making fights more rewarding then, because that will induce bandwagoning to the strongest server - losing fights isn't rewarding after all.
---
No matter which way you do it, WvW can never be a rewarding game mode unless the fun itself is the reward, for which ArenNet needs to substantially change two things: how WvW works and player mentality. The former would require an overhaul of the mode, the latter is impossible because there's always people who will do everything to increase their reward and cant be arsed to just play for fun. Source: literally any game ever, especially those after almost any genre has a broadside application of leveling systems and challenges / unlocks.
---
I disagree. Having to walk back is an excellent way to encourage people to play better. You cannot have everything be positive reinforcement in a PvP mode; eventually people have to face negative consequences for their mistakes.
---
I also predict the mount won't actually be particularly fast. It'll likely be as fast as a player running with swiftness, and the active speed boost roughly equal to an occasional leap. It'd be a large speed boost for necros, but otherwise doesn't change travel speed very much for anyone else.
---
You're talking to a guy that multiclasses, not a mesmer main.
---
Mesmer doesn't tank AND do highest dps at the same time, they're different builds. The sheer variety available to mesmer is a *good* thing, not a bad one, and is something all classes should have access to.
---
The thing is that Raids in GW2 are more about mechanics than DPS. As long as you have a proper build and don't fail the mechanics, you can kill bosses even with mediocre squad DPS. This does make them easy for experienced players that have good DPS and excel at the boss mechanics, but it also makes it more fun oddly enough.
---
Maybe their ropes tie together, make a mess, and you have to spend 10 supplies to untie them. 
---
Nice statement tho, but it will be the same as every big wvw patch.  first tons of players join wvw. second tons of players getting flammed and kicked out of squads, because they play thief or something else.   third... they leave wvw... fourth  the wvw community wonders why this game mode feeels "dead" and asking anet to give more love to wvw
---
Or participating on Reddit/forums.
---
But that's just a theory, a gayme theory. 
---
Anyone expecting an announcement about alliances lacks the ability to understand, because they said "the announcement will not be about alliances"
---
I agree with you. Having to change skills and weapons while walking in WvW so you are not a turtle is boring. 
---
No, switching to defensive stats is not the way to go. It's only delaying you learning ennemies and patterns. Guild Wars 2 is a matter of personnal skill, not stats stacking.
---
Oh you're not alone :)
---
I've been doing WvW for many years and I'm looking forward to the mount too.  And really, any major change would have most of the WvWer all up in arms.
---
I do think there will be concerns but I also think Anet will address it like they with the gliding.
---
Only thing I don't like is going to be the queues getting in!
---
So mounts can now be used in WvW?
---
I think you overestimate how many people play wvw. I think a mount would do less than just introducing bonus weekends. I don't think ANet knows how to gauge just how little it would take their main player be satisfied while still providing support and marketing to other game modes. There's a reason most people just ran silverwastes or istan. We want to see impressive gains in just a measly hour. 
---
&gt;Scourge healing nerfed.  Also scourge barriers nerfed. Also scourge no longer corrupts boons or converts conditions.
---
If they actually did this scourge could be balanced for pvp and pve. 
---
Might be a good idea for everyone to wait to complain about the mount until it arrived and people had time to try it out.
---
Sadly, that isn't stopping people either.
---
Implying PoE players don't complain just the same about balance, content drought, low player retention rate, bot-reliant economy, map drops, etc. Or that the gw2 playerbase is not infinitely more whiny about the game's monetisation and balance, and thus pushing devs away.
---
And of course, the vital difference is the nature of the game. PoE is all about that infinite grind, while gw2 is expected to release new content at a frequent pace.
---
I can’t get over the fact that you use a chain/rope to pull the gate but the gates open inward.
---
But they're all crazy rare, and things that just aren't worth the effort. I'd do the same 20 minute content every week for a year for a chance at an epic mount skin, but not for a music box
---
This game is dying. Let’s go back to GW1. 
---
I've found, as long as you're surrounded by people, there's always toxicity.
---
They need to revive GW1
---
Heres a quick insight on why the WvW seems toxic. When you are bad or near usless in PvE or raids, at worst you are a waste of that slot and are a sum net 0 for your team or raid. But in WvW, if you're not really doing a role(ie. zerg with the right builds, Havoc, Zerg busting, roaming) you are now a sum net negative. You are taking a slot in the queue and you are a rally bot and actively making the other teams do better.
---
now the problem is that the WvW builds have slowly been more and more firebrand and scourge based. so if you're not doing either that or Hammer Rev, you'll get flamed. and the builds are so stacked to these classes because ANET nerfs classes for other game modes, mostly raids, and it affects WvW to the point that you wont see spellbreakers unless a massive guild is bringing them, you wont see thiefs unless a group is running stealth bombs, you wont see chronos unless they're there just for veils and Grav wells. It really doesn't help the new guys who are coming into WvW for their first time with the choices that they have with what classes to play. 
---
There is an aegis focused spec for guard called core guardian.
---
There is a huge difference between having interaction with another group (attackers vs defenders) and avoiding interaction to get caps (ninja capping).
---
No shit you can use your wit to ninja objectives but... it won't make a difference compared to nightcap / off prime coverage and it won't be fun unless you really like karma. 
---
Objectives should be an OBJECTIVE for defenders and attackers to fight around. Not a place where defenders try to stall attackers, to then port out the moment they get through the doors. 
---
And yes, most of the game's players are complete monkeys with no clue of what they're doing. The fact remains that defense has gotten buffed out of its ass to the point where most groups cannot contest upgraded objectives at all, which renders a majority of the map useless and often leaves groups without meaningful objectives to fight for. This is bad. 
---
You forgot the [Garbage Legion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rexavian_Redfoot).
---
Gw2 community used to be the best. Then comes the toxic raiders, fractals, wvw and pvp people who think they own the game.
---
If new players see this shit, they will leave and the game suffers.
---
In the trailer, the mount broke a gate all by itself. With the hilarious fun fact that gates till now only ever have been broken to the inside, so seeing a mount pulling the gate open and the gate animations going the opposite way is quite jarring.
---
Rifle butt damage increased by 10%.
---
I don't get why so many people are butthurt. I love WvW, it's the only game mode I play, and I'm looking forward to it. No matter what Anet gives us WvW players, people always bitch and moan about it before it's even out. I'm guilty of doing the same with the Pharus longbow. I thought it looked like the chaos longbow skin combined with that Azureflame longbow, but when I saw it in game, I turned 180 degrees and ended up making it myself, because the detail of it was amazing.
---
I think this mount thing is going to be good. If it is good, people will quietly mumble to themselves and continue to play, moaning about what Anet could have done - and, on the other side, if it's bad, of course people will say 'look, we told ya so! We KNEW this was gonna happen!'. Either way, you can't win with people. I'm surprised Anet even gives us WvW updates anymore - no matter how little we get, as soon as we're shown something that's gonna be added - it's OUT WITH THE PITCHFORKS!!!!
---
Sigh...
---
But I already listed Ash Legion. ;p
---
For raids, I see nowadays in LFG's sometimes druids/heal. Scrolling over the snowcrows site, I see two builds. Firebrand heal, and Renegade heal. Should I have both of those, or are they both good? Which build is used at more encounters in PUGs?
---
Called it :( let's hope for the best
---
I know I know. I play several hours a day, so no rushing needed. ;)
---
Thats probably the evasion skill. They can change endurance bar amount, fill status upon mounting and consumption on a per mount basis, so they should be easily able to feed that skill with endurance and balance regeneration.
---
Why fix skill lag, when you can have a new mount?
---
&gt; The fact that anet is releasing a mount specially designed for wvw means they know very well that current pve mounts would break the game mode.
---
More likely, they know that a new mount means they can sell more skins.
---
Maybe a few can plead ignorance. A fair few are there to keep up participation 
---
Even if it comes out, some quick napkin math based on the numbers they gave for alliance size, wvw play rate, etc implies that it won't actually have any groundbreaking influence on how WvW plays out. But don't tell the 'wvw players' or they will really go crazy :p
---
Arenanet and communication... nice joke
---
If only there was a way to make a screenshot of your screen and crop out the Asura or use Snipping Tool around the Asura... what a shame... if it were 2003 already...
---
Except that suggests they think WvW players are entirely separate from normal players and can't otherwise be monetised.
---
That may be true, but if they believe that too then there's a problem since they're always going to do better by improving WvW into something everyone wants to hop into and give one of the game's best unique selling points a revival to entice new players.
---
A mount isn't going to entice new players.
---
I like the comparison but you are right only on high-level. 
---
The trailer does nothing what an advert should be doing, such as making you feel like you need it or like you identify with the person riding it.
---
The mount received a sizeable negative review. 
---
Sadly, yes.
---
To be fair, the balance patches historically pretty much never acknowledged the existence of wvw.
---
Nice Thread but there are some concerns i dont share because they are fixed already. 
---
No mounting infight. 
---
No spamming abilities because of the cooldown Not being reset when diamounting. 
---
Using the rune for engange is not worth against smart enemys. 
---
I just worry about the grafics and the abuse terrainwise
---
No, they would answer it anyway to close it (or ask for more info) if they thought someone was trying to steal it. Sorry, just have to be patient.
---
I guess that suggests it's a mocked up animation so it might not be representative of the skill at all.
---
I wonder why... maybe it's because after 6 years the amount of things that need balance, fix, rework is pretty big but they literally dgaf, we are waiting alliance since more than a year and an half and we are stll far from release...
---
Is it good for a zerg to all have free gate destroying ability? (even if just some kind of debuff)
---
Genuine question.
---
&gt; Also where to start if this would be my venture. 
---
Download the free base game and play around until your character hits level 80. Free accounts have several restrictions that will make everything feel clunkier than it should be (specially in terms of inventory/trading), but there's no risk. Once you maxed it, you'll want to buy the expansions. 
---
GW2 has 2 expansions: **Heart of Thorns** and **Path of Fire**. HoT introduced a lot of new systems (including a glider and the first 4 raid wings), while PoF introduced mounts and 2 extra wings. My recommendation is to try buying both if possible (there's a bundle that includes both for 50-.) (last expansion usually gets discounted with each Living World episode release, next one should be released around late April/May). Although mounts are cool and useful, if you want to raid and you have to prioritize an expansion, I would suggest getting HoT first.
---
Each expansion adds one specialization to every class (and any of them will let you pick a 9th class called Revenant). You may want to look at what role does each spec have when choosing your starting class. You can take a look around [this](https://snowcrows.com/) page to check builds, compositions and stuff (raid stuff), while [this](https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki) one has builds for other game modes (I'd use this one for open world leveling and non-raid stuff). 
---
Snowcrows' compositions aren't what you will encounter usually (until you get into an experienced well-coordinated guild). You will normally have 2 healers (either 2 Druids or 1 Druid+1 alternative healer, which is normally better for several reasons), and 2 chronos are always brought in regardless of the encounter. There's an alternative which replaces the 2 Chrono/1-2 Druids with 1 tank Chrono/1 Firebrand/1 Renegade/1 Druid. Fb/Rn adds a good amount of dps to the group, but it's more meta-depending and you have to make sure you have both specializations in your squad. The reason for this is that there are 3 [boons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Boon) that are really important dps-wise. Druid heals and gives boon [A](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Might), Chrono tanks and/or gives boons [B](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quickness) and [C](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Alacrity) (you need 2 Chronos to cover the whole squad), Firebrand gives boon B, heals and deals some damage and Renegade gives boon C and deals some damage. 
---
In terms of equipment, you can ignore it while you're leveling (update it as you drop stuff, no need to craft/buy anything). Once you're 80, try to get full exotic equipment **before** entering expansion maps. You can start leveling up masteries and working towards your ascended equipment while you play through the expac maps (if you're committed, I suggest you to level up some crafting professions. They require some initial gold investment but are really worth it long term). Power ascended trinkets can be gotten through numerous ways, but the rest of the meta stat combinations are locked behind expansion and (specially) Living World content (story episodes that are released every 3-4 months with a map and a bunch of new content). You unlock the last one freely just by logging in (while you're f2p, you will unlock it, you just won't be able to play it until you get the expansion they belong to), but the older ones have to be bought. **Season 3 Episode 3** ([A Crack in the Ice](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/A_Crack_in_the_Ice)) is the best way to acquire trinkets overall, it belongs to HoT and gives you access to condition damage trinkets (and easier-to-get power ones). For support combinations (Harrier's, Diviner's), your best option is **Season 4 Episode 2** ([A Bug in the System](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/A_Bug_in_the_System)) (they are definitely not the best with names) (this one belongs to PoF), but this method is slower than the S3E3 one. For armor with Diviner's stats (Chrono), you need the last episode [All or Nothing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/All_or_Nothing) (**S4E5**), which you should unlock the moment you login for the first time, so you can jump in when you by PoF.
---
Do *really* complain about the trailer? No other worries? Not the balance, not the people players without the mount trying to catch up with the commander? 
---
Bigger map with bigger castles and keeps, bigger player cap, better servers , better weekly reward and server balance
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **1st Cakeday** torikaze! ^(hug)
---
because WvW players are apprehensive to any new additions to wvw
---
[removed]
---
I dont think anyone has argued that the mount is bad/shit etc. but AFAIK Anet said the where big things coming to WvW and a mount is not really that big. Its hardly "content" for a week and its over.
---
First of all I appreciate you now getting triggered like most people do here, its kind of refreshing to actually be able to have a conversation.
---
I have always felt that the balance between free and paid things has not been the best in GW2 but I truly think they have tried to do their best with the resources they have. Been working in game development for almost a decade and I can say that people that build these games are nothing short of passionate about what they do and literally pour themselves into the product so that people get great experiences. I think when you are Mike O and you have around 500 employees that rely on your decisions to be paid you will most likely do your very best to find the right balance to provide good content that can at the same time generate enough revenue to keep everyone happy and as far as I know NCSoft are not even close to being what Activision is for Blizzard. I think adding a mount skin or something of that nature every LWS that you can get by maybe completing the map meta achievement would be a good place to start, pair that with elaborate map meta events and you have already a better experience than most of the new maps.
---
I think people that complained about HOT are the reason we are in this mess, HOT was by far the best content they have ever produced, every map you play in feels rewarding, you look at season 2, again SW, dry top very good and rewarding maps but then they listened to the vocal minority and went to what we have now, content has has zero retention possibilities so yeah there is way for improvement here. 
---
Generally going back and retouching old content its not the best use of your resources, community will just see it as lazy.
---
To be fair no other company has so much interaction with the community as ANet has, you have weekly shows with devs that for the most part interact with the community and I think its not ok to assume they are out of touch, trust me when I say we loose sleep over the products we work on, hurts to see the community doesn't like something you spend months in building and for sure you are gonna do your very best to address these issues but again it comes down to finding cost effective solutions and it doesn't work every time. 
---
All that being said I do agree there is room for improvement and I hope to see a change with the next LWS Season and maybe the expansion if we get one.
---
Tough luck if you're on a server like Kodash EU, thats definitely a toxic and troll ridden server if i have ever seen one. The "community" on this server really is three heavily segregated communities all wanting to play WvW differently and constantly hating on each other the very second Kodash faces some resistance or dare i say challenge. Then Kodash fights itself more than the two actual opponents.
---
These players also frequently turn on anyone who comes from PvE to experience WvW. I feel extremely sorry for the poor souls having to endure this.
---
&gt; But server winning is the main point of WvW.  Groups/Guilds that are better, play better, work better together want better and exclusive rewards. 
---
Most groups have very limited impact on server winning due to how nightcap / off prime works. 
---
Source for Aet saying there will be new elite specs with the next expansion
---
Because as far as I know all they’ve said is that after season 4 comes season 5 and not a expansion
---
Just in case you want to give it another try.
---
First, go defensive with your equipment and skills. Take the Meta builds as a guideline and then pick the most defensive options for everything. In the beginning, it's all about survival so you can actually stay with the commander long enough to learn something. (where to stand, when to push, and so on)
---
Focus on nothing but that part. Just stay alive and close to the commander.
---
Ideally, search for your servers discord or teamspeak. Most servers have one set up and you can find open groups there most of the time. They just require you to listen to the commander. And just follow.
---
It might sound simple, but it actually is difficult staying close to the commander in a fight. But once you learn how to do that, you will stop dying. Or at least you stop dying when your commander doesn't. That's when you can start learning how to deal damage as well. And this is when WvW in large groups starts to be fun. When you actually live through it once in a while.
---
Players who go into WvW don't do so for making gold, like SW and Istan runs.  We do for the competition.  
---
Mounts may add a new layer to metas in WvW, but not because it's innovative or anything.  It's just a new tool.  I welcome anything different for WvW because it's starting to become stale.  However, it's not like Anet's doing this for our sake.  The motivation for this is to sell skins later.  There are so many other things they could have done or addressed over the years that could improve WvW.  The new alliance mechanic was a step in the right direction, and we've been waiting so long to see how it'll turn out.
---
It feels Anet just has their priorities on making money, rather than providing a good product.  Granted, this is a business, and they need to answer to their owners.  But there are so many suggestions or existing ideas that could not only improve WvW, but the while game.  In GW1, there were so many game modes that could have been ported over to GW2.  PvP with the Hall of Heroes was much better.  Alliance battles that allowed someone to claim actual territory in game.  Raids based on territory held.  Oh, and a guild vs guild system that was actually based on guilds fighting each other on dedicated maps, and not some arena thrown in the corner of a jumping puzzle.
---
Since this game is starting to get old, I'm left with hoping Anet learned what works and what doesn't, and not repeat these mistakes in GW3 or GW mobile.  
---
Lastly, 6-7 years after launch, and still no Cantha.
---
(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
---
Gosh, this is the only quest in GW2 that made me tear up, really. But I think it's fine. People need time to come to terms with themselves and usually there's no supernatural things that just happen and make everything better. For us, the PC, such occurrences might be more common.
---
She understands the matter however, so it makes the whole situation a little less sad, imo.
---
Increased mobility favours defense more than attack. 
---
This is because the distance for defenders is virtually always shorter (except SM), defenders have advantageous terrain so they tend to win due to attrition in a stalemate; and they can stall attackers from regrouping by closing gates / walls / ... or picking them off before they reach the group. 
---
Is it? Spot on? I want a better life, a better job, a better partner, a better house, a better haircut, a better computer. Can you give me all those things or even tell me what any of my problems are?
---
You can put the word better in front of anything and say that's what you want but it ain't gonna help the developers deliver it or even figure out what it is you want delivered.
---
With the rewards elements of the post, WvW rewards have seen several phases of rewards improvement. Originally it was just loot bags and karma, then they added masteries and reward tracks, now we have pips on top of all that.
---
There are real reasons why they don't put rewards for specific capture objectives rather than the current system of trying to track and reward any kind of active participation (which is sometimes abused but mostly it functions as intended). If keep captures are given much bigger rewards, it incentivizes players to ignore other helpful tactical objectives and discourages other useful but less rewarding activities (like flipping supply camps). There is also issues with karma trains forming, where zergs will naturally avoid figihting each other to flip towers and keep on maps uncontested, literally allowing enemy zergs to flip an easily defended structure because it's rewarding to capture it back. This is literally something that took place a lot back in 2013 and throughout the entire history of EotM being active.
---
There are issues with tiered rewards awarding greater things - tier of an objective isn't the only (or even primary) measurement of how difficult it is to take. Flipping a T3 SM is often done by PvDoor in OCE/SEA/EU hours after the controlling server's guilds log out. Why should a long siege of SMC during prime time hours with huge three way fights be awarded the same rewards as flipping a T3 SMC when no-one defended it? There are also issues where defence of a structure isn't rewarded (and is difficult to measure and reward).
---
Server balance is something they are actively working on with the alliance system. There is no way to make the current system work (and it's very likely the alliance system won't be perfect). If WvW players want action on this, they should be happy because ArenaNet are working hard on producing it.
---
Rewarding a weekly match win more than the current system does (bonus rank up chests?) will only make server balance issues worse. If players were awarded less shinies for being on a server that never comes first (ironically this would happen to the second strongest server in the tier - they don't move up or down each week and thus usually come second, the third and first place server would rotate in and out into stronger/weaker tiers and usually come first every other week) players would simply stack onto servers that are likely to come first, further enhancing population balance problems. ArenaNet did a massive survey over a year ago into WvW problems and priorities and one of the ideas they communicated was that weekly match up rewards are incompatible with a volatile server/tier system. They said they wanted to avoid adding lots of rewards for weekly wins until they fix/change the current server system to allow for balanced match ups.
---
Any changes to rewards structures need to carefully consider the impact of those changes on player behaviour. Players will follow the carrot on the stick, you don't want to disrupt competitive player behavior in a game mode as complex as WvW by funneling players into specific tasks to get the most rewards, that's why simply maintaining participation is the primary method of awarding WvW players - it's server neutral so it doesn't move players to stacked servers, and it doesn't favor certain play styles over others.
---
The concerns you raised are complex and aren't necessarily problems - some of them are the way they are by design after carefully considering all the options.
---
&gt; Being able to glide while in combat is dumb
---
That's just repeating your statement and not an argument. Running away from a fight, regardless of how, can sometimes be the best course of action. In this case, only one "party" is allowed a certain "kind" of "running away": the defenders. That's fine with me. It's their land, so they should have the advantage.
---
And "just" gliding away isn't without danger either. You do run the risk of being victim of a "sniper" and fall to your death.
---
[Maybe...](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zL48ecvX2NkW1cU0FEfgrCc7Rgo=/0x0:900x500/920x613/filters:focal(378x178:522x322):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49493993/this-is-fine.0.jpg)
---
But then he'd actually have to become a good player.
---
Class balance has been getting worse, not better. I mean the amount of viable classes in WvW groups and roaming (seperate) has both gone down over the years. I agree perfect balnace is a pipe dream but things getting WORSE isn't a good sign is it? 
---
The goal is hopefully to attract players to the game mode. Which this will certainly accomplish and then it'll fade away once people get their shiny new pet and go back to silverwastes. If ANet wants to make wvw popular there's not much more they have to do than ramp up special reward weekends that incentivize players to hop into the game. The average player isn't complicated to understand - they follow the carrot on the stick. ANet just drastically overthinks what kind of carrot needs to be provided.
---
&gt; I was amused at first, and then increasingly *aroused*.
---
&gt;tons of players getting flammed and kicked out of squads, because they play thief or something else
---
this is 80% why i dont wvw
---
Probably, just like they want car commercials showing the new car in a traffic jam, because thats how it really is.
---
Never played wvw, what does blue commander mean? Had no idea there were differences between the colours in wvw
---
Pretty sure it was after PoF.
---
But what about chairs? O_O
---
Have every server become like Piken you mean? gg
---
I totally forgot about the guild boost for the past 2 years...
---
You gotta love how pve-only players tell us how grateful and poised we should be about an implementation that they think improve the game mode for them every single time yet the retention has just gotten worse and worse.
---
As if fixing the mobility problem newer players have (when adapting and learning how to move around the map if not learning how to actually pvp, isn’t an option that has existed to them for years) is gonna keep them interested in playing this utterly flawed game mode where dying super fast and lack of understanding of the flow is still gonna be just as problematic for them. If you truly believe that in 6 yrs, your issue with not enjoying wvw is entirely tied to having to run back when you die, it’s because you haven’t cared to get better and learn how to avoid that. 
---
I know this will just get downvoted but it’s the truth. Everyone started on the same level and had to learn how to deal with this to the point it’s not an issue for veteran players because we’ve gotten through that phase and learned where to go if you want to avoid being ganked along the way or how to position and play better in a fight so you don’t die. People don’t like to hear that, I know. 
---
I expect such little retention from this group that’s claiming it’s all they needed to enjoy the game mode... :/
---
It's been like this since day 1, nothing new.  They don't release information like this because people can speculate what runes or sigils to buy up and basically take advantage of the market before the changes happen.
---
this is a panzerfaust it fausts panzers
---
Oh god now I can't un-see it. Thanks a lot mate.
---
He never said that the expansion would be next. Just that we're getting specs when it comes.
---
&gt; server alignment reroll
---
inb4 4 server clusterfuck :(
---
Rocket chairs with ram abilities are probably \*on the table\*
---
It looks pretty amazing but until we get a better idea of what it does I think I'll reserve judgment. 
---
Hey I love WvW as it was. 
---
But at this point what can go wrong. The gamemode becomes more carebear? That's just the regular progression we've had during the last 5 years. 
---
PPT balance becomes a mess? That's already the case! 
---
Fights become a complete joke with zergs jumping in with broken mounts? Wait that's also already the case. 
---
I mean if you want any type of reasonable fight, you need to set arbitrary rules and scrims already. Because the gamemode was real fucking broken before. 
---
All you gotta do is accept reality that anet gives no fucks about competitive WvW, wants to use is as a 2.0 openworld meme, don't put effort into it and just farm plebs if / when you feel like.
---
Support WvW by becoming a casual. Dont' lead pugs, don't organise communities, don't put any effort in. That's the GW2 way. 
---
Charr Legions: Charr equivalent for the Pact factions.
---
I'm kind of interested what a full squad with these new mounts can do to doors.  Might go faster than 5 rams on a single door O_O
---
I always picked ash but this makes it a toss up between blood and iron, nice job OP
---
Pretty much my short WvW experience. That is, if you actually make it back to the zerg with roaming being a thing. Not saying roaming is bad but if you want new players to join your glorious WvW, it doesnt help making their initial experience as miserable as possible.
---
Saying you want better balance isn't highlighting an issue. It's just complaining.
---
But is getting new players, who may or may not even stay, worth losing the dwindling core of veterans who love the game mode and yearn to see it improve.
---
Who knows, maybe I’m wrong and the mount will make things fun after all but considering how they broke PvE I’m not keeping my hopes up.
---
That’s not what they said though. They highlighted the exact issues and what needs balancing, they didn’t just say “balance wvw reeee”. 
---
&gt; second tons of players getting flammed and kicked out of squads, because they play thief or something else.
---
Found a problem dedicated WvW players can work on already.
---
OP, honey, you've got a big storm coming.

I have played WoW and Guild Wars (1&amp;2) for many years, and have appreciated how vastly different the two games are. My recent raiding credentials in WoW aren't as impressive as they used to be, but I've got a nice collection of server-first kill titles from WotLK, Mythic clears from 2012 till near the end of WoD when we went on hiatus due to most of us being in our mid-30's (and one of our DPS had a stroke at 29. Oof :c)
---
When that happened, GW2 came out with their own raids, and I was able to go all-in for the most part.
---
In terms of Rewards and Gameplay, GW2 and WoW's raids are quite different. I'll do my best to describe what the GW2 experience is in terms a WoW veteran can understand. I'll go into Rewards first, although I believe a lot of other posters have gone into this in some degree but may have been light on some details.
---
**GW2's raid reward philosophy** is in-line with the rest of the game's reward systems in regards to player equipment. When you kill a boss you get a set amount of currency, a legendary crafting token, a chance of getting a piece of ascended-quality equipment and a chance of a mini or other novelty item. You may not be guaranteed an equipment drop, but your loot is personal-loot. What you get is yours, but you can't trade it to others unless it specifies that it's not an account-bound item. Most (if not all) equipment drops are account-bound, so that if you get an item you can't use on the character you brought to the raid, you can give it to an alt. If you are uninterested in the item, you are able to break it down into additional raid currency and other rare crafting components. You can also trade in unwanted novelty rewards (minipets and toys) for generous amounts of currency.
---
The raid currency functions as the old Badge of Justice system did in TBC/WotLK/so on. It's a failsafe against awful RNG. However, while you can purchase the exact drop you want from a boss from a given raid, the currency price is high and the purchase ability only unlocks if you've successfully defeated the boss the item would've come from. You can't just farm the first two bosses of a raid wing to buy a neat-looking skin that comes from the last boss -- you have to kill that last boss at least once before you can buy its skins. That, and killing just the first two bosses of a raid over and over will take months to get enough currency for one item.
---
All ascended gear -- whether from crafting or drops from all raids -- are the same strength. The 2H sword from Vale Guardian (first boss, first raid) will be as strong as a 2H sword from Mythwright Gambit (latest raid).  What winds up being the reward from completing raid encounters are equipment cosmetic appearances, titles and toys. You can re-use gear appearance on any of your appropriate equipment, on any of your characters. Think of it as this game's transmog system. A plus side from this, though, is that you get to pick the exact statistics you want from gear. Instead of having to weigh between pants from boss 3 or pants from boss 8, a pair of pants will let you chose the statistics you want. You can even modify what these stats are later on with reasonably inexpensive material cost.
---
*the TL;DR from a rewards perspective then is: your rewards are for the prestige skins/toys you would only get from a raid. If you are doing this for getting best-of-the-best equipment, you can get equally strong equipment from all other game modes -- PvP, WvW or Open World/Story PvE. *
---
**In terms of Gameplay**, the raids have similar elements to what you would expect from a WoW raid, but departs on several pertinent points.
---
First major departure is something that a lot of people who play this game don't think about -- there are very little addons in GW2. There are no integrated addon support that would allow for things like Bigwigs or DBM, which means a lot of the timers that you'd come to expect in a standard fight in WoW simply cannot exist (very well, if at all) in GW2's raids. The default UI experience is fairly similar, that point aside. There are raid grids to view raidmate's HP, although no aura warnings to show off debuffs beyond what you can visually see on the player model. There are also raid markers -- both markers you can assign to targets, and markers you can place on the terrain.
---
On the point of there being no player aura warnings on the player grid, a lot of debuff management is handled differently on a per-fight basis, and a profoundly strong responsibility of managing damaging debuffs falls on the individual player, especially in some fights where said debuff can cause a secondary AoE attack. In fact, there is a lot of strong personal responsibility that goes into all raid participants' survival and avoidance of damage. All players have the ability to dodge attacks, at baseline they get two quick evades in a given amount of time (every 20-25 seconds, give or take). Classes and specializations can modify the behavior and frequency of these evades, but everyone gets these hard dodges. As another poster stated, the difficulty of managing this task can vary, but I feel that it hinges at about Heroic-raid difficulty in managing your own ability to not be in fire (and how quickly it can kill you if you don't).
---
That said, the DPS requirements of most boss fights in raids can vary, but it's actually more forgiving than one would expect, provided you're doing the fight in the "normal, intended" way. There are fights that can be executed more straightforward if there are 'optimal' amounts of DPS (Gorseval being a big example of this, Keep Construct as well). What this means, is that the DPS that 'meta' groups can put out is well above the intended target of many fights' designs. The DPS ceiling for many fights, then, can be put at ... well, well ABOVE FLR-quality, but it's below Heroic difficulty, for sure. You need to know how to execute your damage, but your ability to obey fight mechanics is far more important.
---
Also on the point of fight survival, is that the roles of healing and tanking are far more nebulous in GW2 than it is in WoW. Tank threat is literally determined by who has the highest amount of bonus armor (+Toughness stat) of the raid. That's it. What "tank cooldowns" that exist then are whatever survival cooldowns a player's class/specialization has. What this means, is that ... remember Leotheras the Blind? Remember how you had a Warlock tanking the demon?  The warlock can tank the whole raid now. Except replace 'warlock' with Chronomancer. Healers are normally Druids -- a specialization of Rangers (Hunters). There are also support Necromancers. We don't discuss this in polite company, though. A great amount of healing you'll receive is normally from yourself. Every player has some form of self-heal spell, usually with some built-in utility (condi cleanse is a popular secondary effect to bring along, especially if the heal is AoE). 
---
Usually what a balanced raid team looks for is for what kind of utility a class brings to help boost everyone's collective DPS, much like how older WoW raids would have to consider between Mark of the Wild, Kings, Might, PW: Fort, Imp Aura, Shaman Totems and other effects. There is a cap of players one can bring to a raid, which is 10. There are nine classes, and often people will want to stuff the group with as many elementalists as possible, and maybe two chronomancers. There is a lot of overlap and some interplay between group buffs, but generally Support-specced Chronomancers are best at boonsharing. Think of Chronomancers as the buff-machine Paladins of yore, except Ghostcrawler never got his hands on them.
---
And as an aside, doing PUG raids in GW2 has personally been a mixed bag experience for me. Some people are willing to pick up non-meta players just as long as they're a body that does damage and spends the fight more alive than dead. Other groups will request you link how many Legendary Insights you've looted, or Legendary armor pieces you've obtained. There are Discord communities that have formed up with the intention of acting as a Raider.IO equivalent. It can come off as there being a giant wall of requirements to surmount before you can get into 'the raiding scene', but there are tons of more open raiding groups that exist, and many players are willing to teach someone who knows how to not stand in fire how to do these raids. Having a guild will, of course, make things much more easier.
---
If anything, the first 3 years I played GW2, I enjoyed it just fine without indulging in its raiding experience (as it didn't exist yet). There is a lot in this game where you can just relax and do some mindless running around with buddies. If anything, this game comes off as being far less competitive than WoW in every way. You're never fighting over boss drops, gathering nodes or mob tags. If you are burnt out on WoW, maybe an MMO that's very different from what WoW is in most ways will be a refreshing experience.
---
Good luck and Have Fun.
---
&gt;Except that suggests they think WvW players are entirely separate from normal players and can't otherwise be monetised.
---
Have you seen this subreddit?
---
"WvW doesnt' need updates because they dont' spend money. The real moneymakers are open world casuals that log in, buy shinies and log out"
---
&gt;You gotta love how pve-only players tell us how grateful and poised we should be about an implementation that they think improve the game mode for them every single time yet the retention has just gotten worse and worse.
---
The problem is you haven't even tried it yet. You are already condemning and lambasting something that you haven't tried. You have no idea how this will effect WvW and yet you are convinced it is a bad thing.
---
I’m more of a roamer. Had a long day though and didn’t fancy running all the way to objectives only to be jumped by gankers. This is the main reason I’ve switched to PvP for that competitive itch. It’s more fair and doesn’t require the time sink of running around. 
---
This is probably the meme going around Anet offices as they try to justify all the discontent as some elitists trying to gatekeep WvW, and why the mode never ended up being very successful.
---
"Broke" PvE?
---
More like majority of playerbase being hyped about new mount and WvW regulars crying out for balances while Anet just runs us all over with new gemstore purchases. 
---
but in a raid, unless it's one of the harder raids (which by the way you can start in a easier raid) you can easily get carried by someone who is significantly better. But in a game of WvW, 1 dead guy  is 5 rallies in the middle of a 30v30 or 40v40
---
Except I don't think this was targeted to new players. Tbh
---
the lack of self STAB is it's biggest down fall. It's like top dps or it dies first lol.
---
Didn't blame any elitists ... you brought that up xD
---
OP was talking in general...or at least in how I read it . 
---
Too RNG for us to even say yet. 
---
Blue tag is usually an open squad for everyone, while other colours are used for guilds or other more special squads. 
---
I'm not arguing. Honestly your post is well thought out and formatted well. I just want to know, how do you know the realm of torment is about as close as the underworld to Tyria? I always kinda just assumed we had no real grasp as where those actually were. So I'm generally curious to find out now. :)
---
90% of the time Pinata will die around xx:22. The spawn delays to 25 if you are on a map that failed a coin collection event. The only time that there usually isn't a 2nd map to join in TD is on reset. 
---
I enjoy both styles, solo / small group roaming and zerging and I love that both is possible and viable. Especially when you roam solo coordinated with your zerg...
---
&gt;WvW team
---
huh?
---
You literally describe how mounts will single handedly kill roaming and a valid strategy (cull the zergling before they reach the zerg). The only hope would be any CC=Instaknocked off mounts in wvw. 
---
Being able to outmanuver bigger groups while maintaining close by/harassing will be gone because the people not in combat will chase you down with mounts.
---
It sucks to think what WvW will become (ZvZ). But then roaming has been hanging on by a thread for awhile anyway, Later Anet!
---
In Verdant Brink Meta, which chopper brings me to which boss? I can never get it right...
---
It was a bit more than a year ago. I remember reading the blog post beforw MHW launched and I took a break from the game.
---
It has an engage skill
---
I absolutely understand and agree with what others are saying, coming from a relative advertising-design field, this trailer did nothing to excite me. I still went like 'yey new mount' but then I was feeling very meh about it because the video seemed very low-effort, 30mins as you put it. No fancy effects, no great angles, no fancy cinematography. 
---
Yes it's just a mount but the abilities of it and scale and detailing could have been showcased better imo.
---
&gt;  zerg all using mounts on the door.
---
who said they can?
---
You will almost certainly have to buy PoF to get it.
---
So a class that meant to be heavy support became okayish healer. Exactly as advertised. Again.
---
My points is, necro spec is never done how it meant to be. It's a hot mess.
---
Core necro was unwanted because of clase mechanic and lack of dps and support. Reaper was not power until PoF came out. It's a bit late I think. Scourge could have good dps but it was gutted instead giving us at least option to trait for dps. And now it's just a healer. When third expac will come out I guess they will rework scourge to actually provide usefull or unique boons. Or they could just remove unique boons from spirits and banners. This could free up so many possibilities. 
---
I can bet that after next elite classes release, necro spec won't be working as advertised, then will be nerfed in pve because pvp players will complain and then it will be reworked to have even different role while still being worse than any other class. 
---
i fuxking hate those elitist predicters like you, that are so toxic and think they knoe the future
---
I watched the trailer multiple times - the movement is natural and fits the Griffon rig it uses. Any slower movement would make it look unnatural. The chance that my estimate is completely wrong is a slim one i fear.
---
It does however level the playing field, nobody is slower or faster than another - you're right in this regard, because unless you can somehow kill the mount of your opponent, there's no catching up for anyone.
---
Charrzooka.
---
Meanwhile, 3 days after the release of a new living story episode, this sub-reddit is already full of "waaaaawaaaah I'm bored again! There's nothing to do in this gaaaaame!"
---
Eh. I quite like the idea of a mount/s in WvW, but don’t like the design of the Warclaw at all; to me it feels uninspired and generic, a horned cat with the Griffon skeleton?
---
I’d have been a lot more excited for a Dolyak mount (something I’ve specifically seen WvWs suggest in the forums), could be slow moving/player speed but able to carry a lot of supply and pull open gates (costing supply per pull). Special movement ability would be to give itself swiftness speed and to others in a zone around itself.
---
I’d also add a Charr Bike mount (another common request), this would be faster with mounted combat skills to act like proper cavalry and allow for more fun tactics than 2 blobs run into each other. Special movement ability would be like the Roller Beetle’s attack but without dismounting as a lance charge.
---
Both would be able to carry one extra player for those without mounts, Dolyaks would be high health so tough against players/infantry, Charr Bikes would be high damage so effective against Dolyaks but very low health so weak against players/infantry.
---
If dismounted by force being able to mount again would have a 3+ minute cooldown in WvW as well as the out of combat requirement, if the Dolyak was carrying extra supply when dismounted that explodes on to the ground like with player kills.
---
At least I’m not the one driving new players away. 
---
Ebonhawke line of skins.
---
Imo these skins all look pretty fantastic.
---
&gt; Nice to see your interventions are always measured and respectful (not)!
---
Respect is earned, not given for being born. Sorry!
---
It is clear from your post that you're an off-prime PPTer. I understand why your point of view is so distorted. It explains a lot. 
---
You see when WvW wasn't a complete shitshow, you'd need DEFENDERS to defend. Not "reeee I siege 5v50 if they're trash, and nope out or try to backcap when they find me!". Walls and gates DELAY enemies for you to form a group and try to defend. Not a way to just defend, avoid all interaction between players and go to backcap.
---
Now I understand some players enjoy backcapping and such. And it's always been very strong. Some players enjoy sieging. But most players enjoy using their skills.
---
Objectives are something to fight for, with attackers and defenders. However good objectives are so broken you can never fight around them. You can have siege wars, but actually fighting in towers and keeps? Well that's a LOT less common than in the old days. Why is that? Because the defenders advantage. 
---
Short term you're happy. Buff to your siege playstyle. Yay! 
---
Long term nobody gives a flying fuck about PPT. Matchmaking and server status becomes irrelevant. I don't PPT to win, I PPT to snipe matchups and avoid other matchups. Many players dont' attack or defend at all. Just indifference towards this aspect of the game because of how broken it is. If I can't attack objectives to get ENEMIES to FIGHT ME rather than players like you shooting siege all day; then i'm not going to do it. Neither are other people. 
---
Having players /not/ care at all, because it offers nothing to them anymore, is bad. It creates hostility rather than having everyone on the same page and makes it more difficult for players to interact between enemy servers.
---
&gt; Your message mostly feels like you are blaming some people for doing what they enjoy in WvW because it prevents you from enjoying WvW the way you want to enjoy it. If they stopped doing what they do for you then you would have fun all the time like you want to but they would not and it's neither a better or a worse situation... While I would love for everybody to be able to enjoy WvW as they want to I don't think it's really fair of you to blame you lack of fun on other people having fun their way. I think this is a deeper issue with WvW and the way it is currently available: with more incentive to win a matchup and a different balance of points for kills/PPT maybe you would get more regular fights against opponents you size while other people who also like to play a slightly longer game (probably not what I meant but I haven't foiud a better one) with attacking/defending structures can also have fun. 
---
Correct. 
---
You seem to think it's OK that the gamemode has been a LOT less fun for the players that want to fight, because it has been buffing your playstyle. But the amount of players and amount of attacking / defending overall has gone down a lot. You pretend this isn't a worse situation. Just different! But it's worse, because there's a lot less players doing a lot less stuff. 
---
Also I'm not saying delete siege or defense, am I? Now if complete garbage players can't hug siege all day and be equally rewarded... I guess that'll be less fun. 
---
You think adding more incentives to win will change anything - but you ignore how BROKEN siege and defense is. People will not play healthy and care as long as winning PPT is directly related to unfun gameplay. No matter how "fun" you find it, most people have better htings to do than playing backcap / siege wars with players who don't give a shit about PPT. 
---
I want you to understand that if you have objectives where a group can fight say 50v40; they'll do that. If the group of 50 can't take a T3 keep unless there's only 5 defenders; they're NOT GOING TO ATTACK that T3 keep unless there's only 5 defenders. Just like you're not going to stay and 5v50 and just die, they're not going to attack and suicide into your siege because you want them to. Promoting inbalance just makes action LESS common without improving anything for either side. 
---
You ENJOY the inbalance because it directly favours you. You're an OFF PRIME ppter that enjoys siege / backcap / avoiding players. I understand you very much like this. Unfortunately you have WAY too much impact on PPT for anyone else to care to even play. Which is really bad. 
---
Not too much damage or a big CD could work, besides using supplies. You can hit doors with your normal weapons. Slow as hell but technically it helps a little bit. 
---
Wow. That's quality armor.
---
Kinda weird that everyone who likes the mount is not into WvW.
---
I can only speak for myself but for me the long travel time was indeed the only thing which kept me from WvW. I play sPvP every day and I'd love to take part in fights on a bigger scale, though I also like the thrill of hunting on my own. But traveling for ten minutes without anything happening besides time going by isn't much fun for me. My hope is that mounts speed up the whole game mode and I do think that's very reasonable to hope for. I know you're quite pessimistic about this change, but in my opinions it's worth trying out. I will send you a message in three months. :-)
---
RemindMe! three months
---
Dude, you forgot the most important: dog commander tag.
---
Because catmander tags surely were a massive success, big population peak in WvW ^for ^ten ^minutes after that *highly requested feature*. Amazing.
---
The only people who are doing it good are guys from Quebec. Exact translation every single time. The result is pretty funny but it always fits the original title. 
---
Ascalonian pants. Male charr necros rejoice
---
If you want to encourage mindless blobbing, then sure, it's lovely. 
---
That is such a breathtaking piece of art though. Fire breathing Nian coming ashore, with tsunami following.
---
Takes me back.
---
Good thing I bound Enter Shroud to a different key! 
---
WvW is basically dead atm so attracting new players should be Anet's priority. And guess what, this new mount will do exactly that. I have no interest in WvW now but I'll give it a go just because I wanna test the new mount. Screw all the haters. 
---
There is a live stream on Friday.
---
This is the equivalent of going to a restaurant by the sea side, asking if their salmon is fresh, being told yes. So you order the salmon, chat with your friends who also ordered their delicious food. An hour goes by and none of the food is in yet. You call the waiter over and ask what's going on, what's taking so long and updates on their food orders. The waiter explains that the food will come eventually, and they're trying to make the salmon and the rest of the food extra special. The waiter gives everyone at the table a free lemonade with 2 extra straws per person to entertain themselves while the food is cooked.
---
You wait..another half hour passes by.
---
Your party has shrunk down to just 3 people from 7, because it's been too long and they were fed up waiting for any food to come. The waiter comes over and serves finally brings news on the food. he tells you that it'll be 10 more minutes as the truck with the fresh salmon was on the way. You hold your complaints and wait.
---
10 minutes pass by..You're now down to 2 people. Your faithful friend who really believes in how tasty the food is at this restaurant.
---
The waiter walks over and servers you the most green, fresh broccoli, with the creamiest mashed potatoes you've ever seen in your life. Next to that is one of the most beautifully baked cod fish you've ever seen. The waiter also gives you free chocolate sundae for the wait. Your friend's food is so-so but she loves sundaes so she's okay to eat the food.
---
You complain to the waiter that you waited for almost 2 hours and the fish isn't even the one he ordered.
---
Then you come in. You start laughing like an ape wondering wtf someone is complaining at that delicious looking food, and on top of that they got a free sundae out of it. 
---
The WvW community has been largely ignored, none of the ideas they've asked for makes it into the game, and Anet and players expect the wvw playerbase to not complain and accept the cool content they're getting. Anet is on their own agenda of "this is truly what they want, not what they ask for!" yet most of the WvW population has left the game because of this and...You guys continue to wonder why WvW players complain. 
---
This is not to say the mount will be bad, but it's nothing to do with what WvW'ers have asked for. It's what PvE'ers want in WvW so they can once in a while come in, take a few towers, pet their new mount, and log off. 
---
&gt;Please don't be toxic to the newcomers. Don't drive them away, pretty please. From my experience the general level of toxicity is equal if not worse than the raid community. 
---
''Please don't be toxic to the newcomers. Don't drive them away, pretty please. From my experience the general level of toxicity is equal if not worse than the raid community."
---
"Please be nice to us, the noobs..." 
---
these couple statements relate to the elitism and toxicity arguments
---
I think will get more people to leave than it will get new people to come. The whole thing will be even more devastating if those leaving are seasoned commanders. 
---
If they want to fix population they should just bring alliances already.
---
At start you will enjoy raids a lot. Joining training grps etc, but after some time you will get annoyed that most of people in this game doesnt care about progress. New raids every 8 or 9 months. You can make a baby in that time :). Most of squads req having LI(getting only one each week from every boss from HoT raids), LD(same as li but from pof raids), kps(guild decoration from killing boss). Even squads that req 1k+ LI cant play or dorsnt care cause it is easy but somehow they are wiping a lot. The other thing is that you cant verify if the things that ppl are pinging as a proof is legit. There are soooooi many chat code pingers. Even if somd players have legit proofs etc they are leeches - carried by team each week or they have everything from raids so they doesnt care. Cause you need only 750li to get all 3 legendary raid armor and title. You need only ~500li to get to 95% of groups. Most of encounters are carried by 2-3 ppl so rest just dps, no need to dodge or do most of mechanics cause you can outheal it or skip with dps. The majority of gw players have "at least it is done" attitude. 
---
You can do all bosses in 3hrs or a bit less or 8+ depend of grp but you cant verify if the grp is good or not before you join raids. There is BL and you can block and name bad ppl. Same with other endgame mode - fractals. Players wants you to ping dwcorations that doesnt means nothing and it is lottery if you find good party or not. Doing all(3) fractal dailies with 2cms you will get around 15gold daily but you need the best gear to put agony res in there. 
---
Understandable.
---
You could do that without a glider though, and die of course. At least this way you can hit someone mid-air which feels incredibly satisfying.
---
Just gotta wait it out 😔
---
They could just make it so that recently deceased, way-pointed players cannot prevent capping for like 30 seconds to a minute. It would incentive zergs to focus on the quality and intelligence of the overall engagements and prevent's waypoint farming almost entirely. Sure they can get back and add to the power of their respective zerg but that is it.  Feels like a fair trade-off and something I would welcome.
---
Peasants solution is also a water weapon but it has the best skin in the game
---
I like the mount the trailer was pointless. They should have waited for the next episode of living world. Its a good trailer as it shows off the mount well.
---
It looks nice, but it may actually make WvW more frustrating for casuals. Your outnumbered server wants to take a keep? Previously it took X amount of time for the big, organised, enemy zerg to get there and kill you. Now it might only take half that, so your window of opportunity is gone. Same thing if you want to take a camp, but there's some skilled enemy roamers hanging around.
---
All the siege have this and we can't just instant spawn them like mounts
---
I'm sorry to break the news my friend but this kind of monetization is never going to be injected into WvW delevelopment because the player base is too niche to be profitable. Just like raids and sPvP, these barely played game modes are mostly on maintenance mode with the occasional yearly update. At best it's going to be injected into more gemstore artists and big PvE maps, at worst it's not going to be injected back into the game at all to show more profits to shareholders.
---
&gt;"Delete the desert borderlands, bring back Alpine"
---
This isn't ridiculous. It's by far the least active / populated map across virtually all matchups in both EU and NA. 
---
I mean howmuch data do you need ot tell you that this map does not function well / isn't very liked?
---
&gt; Back when revenant was a new class to the game, it wasn't uncommon to see "Don't allow revenants to play WvW"
---
Back then hammer rev had 3 seperate hitboxes so hitting 15 rather than 5 players like all other aoe's. The animation was culled more regularly than now and would not show up in most fights. On top of that, hammer rev's existance literally removed pick / focus parties (thief, mesmer, ranger trying to pick off backliners) from ever having a place in the game. Why run high risk builds if a rev can spike them? 
---
&gt; "Don't allow gliding, it'll destroy the gamemode!"
---
And for months you could glide into a LOT of towers and some keeps bypassing all the walls / gates. 
---
**You're pretending like there's no reason for these comments but the ISSUES with all of these things were insanely real and some of them were never adressed / fixed.** 
---
&gt; I'm glad that the devs don't pay attention to the community, because these requests are absurd. 
---
I'm glad this game is in constant decline because the retardation of players like you is absurd. 
---
Eh, people bitching about something they know nothing about. Nothing new. Reserve your judgement, good or bad, until this thing comes out and we know exactly what’s going on. Until then just stop.
---
Interesting. I like that idea of having the Dolyak mount, but I think its also important to not have too many (good) mounts so that the meta revolves around it. Ofc, thats a balancing issue, but we know how Anet think about those.
---
Also, I saw people saying it will be available in pve. Where did they see that? I can't find this information anywhere.
---
Look beyond the few that are salty, or find other people to hang around with.
---
well my GPU usage stays below 10% all the time while running the game so its just sucking my CPU.
---
You haven't read my initial post at all? If you try reading it I even gave exact examples of things being completely ignored for years. Bug fixing and stability are the main issues as per this moment. I'm not the only one in those thoughts. On the contrary all you're trying to do right now is whiteknighting without a single attempt to understand the opposite side's point, reading more or less carefully what's being written or giving any kind of valuable arguments . And if your target is to simply defend the ignorance towards the whole game mode and throw toxicity claims on those who are pointing at it, we have nothing to talk about.

exotic zerker gear is always useful and relevant in a lot of places, open world pve, dungeons, fractals and even in raids on some builds/professions.
---
Renegade is mostly focused on condition damage, bleeding, shortbow range attacks with various support abilities ranging from aoe heals, mass aoe life leach, spamming might and alacrity, providing bleeds on attacks to all players around you and some burning.
---
However elite specs dont mean you absolutely need to use only the new weapon / utility skills and ignore the other 66% of your core class, or that you must go condi dmg instead of berserkers power dps.
---
Kallas fervor grants extra ferocity, alacrity is always nice and spamming might also helps with raw dps.
---
You get a lot of fury, as well as extra 33% critical hit chance if your endurance is full.
---
Combined with rolling mists means you get 40+33= 73% crit chance for free as long as you have fury and 100% endurance.
---
Revenants in general are pretty versatile, even if you try to focus on one legend (which you shouldnt), you could go raw dps, condi in multiple ways, full on healer, boon sharing herald, or alacrity/ offensive renegade support. 
---
play around with various builds [here](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/) or try them out in game in pvp lobby and then see some build guides for current "best" builds and roles before investing in ascendant gear :)
---
You mean the "quest" of completing the area heart for the Jackal and the Springer and then paying for them? Yeah, that's content, albeit not a lot. The griffon quest chain is more considerable since it's more extensive. Advancing through the masteries themselves isn't really content though? Like, you do content to get exp and the mastery points to unlock the mastery, but the mastery itself isn't content.
---
&gt; Respect is earned, not given for being born. Sorry!
---
Ah I forgot you're on of those... I do think basic respect should be given by default but whatever...
---
&gt;It is clear from your post that you're an off-prime PPTer.
---
You make it sound like an insult but yeah I mostly play off-prime because I leave prime-time for people who like to fight in zerg/guild because this period is better for them! But I have also played during prime every once in a while so I know what happens then too. And I also tend to fight a lot because roaming does not mean you never fight players, but you can also know when a cause is lost (like 5 vs 50) there are other scales that 50 vs 50.
---
&gt;Not "reeee I siege 5v50 if they're trash, and nope out or try to backcap when they find me!"
---
If your attack strats are bad and the 5 defenders are good this has been the case for a looong time. But good defenders are rare but bad attacks are more and more the norm. Maybe some siege balance is in order so that defense has a bit less impact but if you put siege in a very bad spot and defenders destroy them it's on you more than on balance imo because they would have been destroyed anyway (I do think that some of the defense spot I have found are a bit too OP for their own good and that they would require fixing).
---
&gt;Because the defenders advantage
---
I agree that good defenders can control a map very well but I also blame it on very bad attackers. If a zerg of 50 can't do what I can with 5 people idk what to tell you but defenders are not the issue here :p
---
&gt;You seem to think it's OK that the gamemode has been a LOT less fun for the players that want to fight, because it has been buffing your playstyle. 
---
No, as I said I would love for everyone to be able to enjoy their WvW and I think part of the problem is that there is no motivation to do X or Y for many players currently while another part has more to do with the way WvW is currently designed.
---
Then again you assume a lot of stuff about my playstyle that are just wrong and seem to oppose PPT and fighting people: they are not incompatible, I do enjoy playing the structure (this applies when I attack or defend one) and also fighting. Guess what happens when I attack a structure? People come to defend it and then we fight (unless they come with 25 people then we mostly die while trying to get at least get a couple of kills as we get rolled over). Small scale fights also exist.
---
&gt;Now if complete garbage players can't hug siege all day and be equally rewarded... I guess that'll be less fun.
---
You are aware that being in defense/scouting/something in this area is extremely less rewarding than going in a zerg? You get way less kills (so way less bags, wxp) and way less participation. By design, unless someone shares participation with you in a squad, hugging siege all day does not give much reward. You also assume anybody that knows how to use a defensive siege is garbage in fighting which again, is just false (just like bieng in a zerg does not mean you know how to fight).
---
&gt;You think adding more incentives to win will change anything - but you ignore how BROKEN siege and defense is. 
---
And you are ignoring how bad people are at attacking and how rare good defenders are. Honestly it has been a very long time since I had the possibility to clearly be able to assert the balance of siege because in most attacks I do I am faced with meh defenders and most defense I do I am faced with obvious strats in very vulnerable spots.
---
Also remember that there was a time when Rams + Shield that could shield themselves was a pretty common strat for zergs and that this was pretty impossible to defend against with 5 people so you had (have? not sure if it's still vaguely realistic now) strats that were able to balance against those 5 good defenders.
---
&gt;they're not going to attack and suicide into your siege because you want them to.
---
Most low-man defense strategies result in destroying siege and almost never killing people, because it's pretty hard at 5 vs 50.
---
&gt;You ENJOY the inbalance because it directly favours you.
---
I'm more saying imbalance is not the only issue and people are not even trying to the point where I have not been able to find a situation where I could correctly witness this imbalance because the context in which siege were used was heavily biased having meh defenders/attackers.
---
Imo T3 should be hard to take because otherwise what's the point of having tiers if they are all more or less easy? But then I think because of the way EU WvW affluence is you can get T3 structures without having to invest much time in them during the night/weekday because you don't have many people available to try and slow the upgrade or reset them. That's the biggest issue with T3 imbalance. If you actually had to invest yourself (and other people not just 1 person) significantly to get a structure to T3 then it being hard to get back would be really deserved: while it could be possible for a Garrison it would/should be way harder for a side keep.
---
&gt;You're an OFF PRIME ppter that enjoys siege / backcap / avoiding players.
---
* I enjoy siege because I think it is part of the mode so I learned how to use it.
---
* I don't usually enjoy exchanging wooden structures, if I can keep a structure I will
---
* The only fight I avoid are the ones that are lost in advance like a 5 vs 50 situation, for the rest I'm never refusing a fight unless I'm on my way to do something that I think more important (ie.  not gonna fight for a random 1v1 if I'm escorting dollys or I am going to help an attacked structure and taking a detour would be ill advised).
---
&gt;Unfortunately you have WAY too much impact on PPT for anyone else to care to even play. 
---
Considering how 75+% of the time when I ask for help because the best I can do is slow down the enemy and that they will get the structure no matter what I get crickets in return am I really the problem?
---
***
---
My biggest issue with your reply is that you assume people who know how to (and do) use defensive siege are automatically cowards that hide behind an AC (because that's the only defensive siege right?) and never ever fight anybody. That the filthy PPTers are the scourge of WvW because only your zerg fight is the only thing that is supposed to be worth!
---
And that you then proceed to apply this statement on me without even knowing how I play: I spend most of my time in WvW doing other stuff than putting down siege in a structure and waiting in it. Hell I think I spend most of my time in offensive roaming because that's what I enjoy the most. But that does not mean I don't knwo how do defend a structure when I need to or play in zerg.

I think what most WvW veterans would at least hope for, is for newcomers to take a look at some builds more suitable for the gamemode and adapt the best they could, and get on voice comm and listen to the commander (if there's one tagged up of course).

Never played WvW but now I have to tame Mr.Snuggles
---
Dear new PvE players. WvW is a team based P V P gamemode. We rely on your co-operation just as much as you rely on ours. 
---
If you want players to be treated well in WvW, inform them on how to become valuable WvW players. Getting a proper build and spec is not "optional" for many groups, it's mandatory. Getting on voice / discord to learn isn't something you do "because you feel like it", it's often a requirement. If you can't accept these, then maybe the group you're following just is not for you. 
---
The biggest damage done to WvW was this subreddit telling players "they can run whatever they want in a zerg because it doesnt' matter"; giving PvE players the entirely wrong perception of how WvW works. 
---
Get on voice if you're asked to. Reroll or change specs if you're asked to. Listen to whatever your commander asks. You're NOT entitled to ignore his requests because "I don't feel like it" or "he's the only commander around". That is not his problem; it is yours. 
---
**So PSA : If your spec isn't useful for WvW groups, your spec likely won't be welcomed in WvW groups.**
---
As a new player I hate on mounts because I'll see an event just ahead of me, start running to it to get that juicy exp, only to see 3-5 people rush ahead and murderstab the boss event.
---
That being said I also saw someone with a bunny kangaroo looking mount and I want it.
---
Tbh, somebody else made a similar post about new people and such, and being afraid of dipping their toes in WvW - here's my response to it if you care to take a look as well as the rest of the thread, I think it will clear out a few points and concerns.

---
To answer to your direct question however - WvW as a gamemode does have potential there's no denying that. 
---
It can be what you want it to be as someone else said here. Its all about the pride and thrill of battle and winning (yes it may sound cocky but it feels good! and also this was more prominent with the old system, before links and pips and rewards). It feels so good being able to contribute to your server, **your Server!** Either with team effort, zerging, or even doing your part as a roamer. Its also where the community and the server really feels like, i don't know, like you've known them for awhile. It feels comfortable and its even fun to spot them in PvE randomly sometimes!
---
 I have been in WvW for 5 years on Yaks Bend, yes you get the occasional trolls and toxics, but damn even those are familiar faces. You get to know people you run with often, have your own little family/contacts/get togethers, its just a nice atmosphere once you get past the starting stages of starting out and not knowing what to do - and joining a guild or 2 helps here too, being on comms, making jokes while bonding with people, listening to music while running together to defend stuff. 
---
This is what really has kept the WvW community going imo and not completely crushed to the ground (although faith is being chipped away). Many think its just a gamemode to go kill a couple randos, do your dailies, troll, and gtfo. But after you get past the initial introduction and **past the passive-aggressiveness and really, truly wanting to get into it its the people and connections, pride and effort that keep you there to keep going.** 
---
**Looking forward to seeing you in the battlefield o7**
---
WvW skill unlocks have long since been account wide, gliding included. Don't see why mount would work any differently. 
---
&gt; Class balance = for zergs, break necro/fb hegemony, similar to what they are trying to do with chrono/druid in PvE. For roaming, rethink "unfun" classes like condition mirage, which hopefully should be present in the next balance patch.
---
There is an argument to be made to regularly change things just to freshen up the meta. Don't aim for balance, just change things so players have to readjust. Although the need to equip and requip constantly is a significant counter-argument to this.
---
Actual balance is impossible and the best you can hope for is changing from one stale Meta to the next. Especially with how players flock to the "one" Meta. No matter whether they themselves can actually benefit from it. (See Raiding, where everyone is running speed clear comps instead of comps that would actually serve them much better)
---
&gt; Siege balance = state a vision for how siege should play out, because right now it's either a quick rush or a slow crawl taking hours where 90% of the players are afk waiting for a few guys to press one button on siege. This is where they can innovate a bit. Perhaps we'll find out mounts are the solution to this, who knows.
---
Siege balance is for me in a rather good place at the moment. Small groups can at best delay (even if many claim otherwise). So you either smash through quickly before the relieve forces arrive. Or you have to fight them. Which adds a lot to the overall strategic decisions made in the match-up as a whole by different commanders. (Things like taking advantage of fights between the two other Servers etc.)
---
New tactical additions like the new mount is a good idea. But it shouldn't get rid of the long sieges. If taking tier 3 becomes easier, it would very quickly become pointless to put in the effort to fortify it in the first place. And this has basically no influence on new players joining in.
---
As opposed to for example adding mounts so all the new players spend less time running back to the com after they died. Which is an actual issue that always shows up as one of the top reasons why people don't stick around in WvW.
---
&gt; Population imbalance = alliances right now. A very important point for the mode, which is why there are so many calls for even an announcement to be made regarding when these changes might be seen (or even prototyped).
---
Alliances have their own problems. see win-trading or selling slots in the powerful alliances. But it hands over population balance to the players, which is the right move. ANet could never achieve that on their own.
---
&gt; Points balancing = another vision point. Do they want night-time PPT to be as strong as it is? Do they want to avoid k-training and blobbing kdr to contribute to points? That said, it doesn't matter because of the next point:::
---
Points balancing is solved with Alliances. It's up to the Alliance to make sure night-time PPP is covered.
---
&gt; Incentive to win matchups = there is almost zero incentive right now to go for a win. Most servers which have enough coordination to control their own PPT are purposefully throwing to avoid bad matchups because of population issues. There is not really much discussion around this point, any change is better than the clown fiesta it has been for the past year or so. Perhaps alliances has a system of rewards or something regarding this.
---
Again, alliances change that. Higher rewards for winning is a bad idea. You already get more pips and others small advantages. The winning side wins fights and already gets more loot. Quite a lot more actually. Making the difference too big means the loosing side has even less incentive to continue fighting. Pretty much the worst they could do.
---
&gt; Performance = probably too late to do anything, but one can hope.
---
There is absolutely no way things can change here in any significant way. Changing the engine enough is prohibitively expensive.
---
&gt; Rewards = if I recall correctly they've stated they don't want to make WvW a reward-generating game mode. Unfortunate to hear, but at least they've given us their vision of the mode. Better than nothing. That said, other people have highlighted how poor the gold generation, and ascended/legendary gear attainment in the game mode is compared to even doing raids once a week. A little extra that could be added without too much drama.
---
Have you seen how huge the outcry is with every single reward change/improvement? About all the horrible PvE noobs now coming into "our gamemode" and mucking things up? Coupled with the issue that roamers, zerg-fighters, guild groups, fighters, people who play the objective, and so on exist. And they all have very different demands on how the loot should be distributed.
---
----
---
In the end, ANet is addressing issues. While these "core issues" are mostly baked into the gamemode and simply can't be changed without significantly reworking it and devalueing at least some of the playstyles within the sandbox. (be it roaming, small groups, guild fights, zergs or others)
---
"push the devs away"? They're there to develop a game, not a fan base. They're manufacturing a product, not giving out hugs. I hate the arguments that devs who make money to feed their families off this are in any way at all ever remotely bothered by the things people say on Reddit. If they were, the game would be different or they'd get another job. If actually you want to live, stop feeling sorry for people who make money off of you. Because that will fucking kill you.
---
WvW is easy.
---
* Get gear with some survivability. If your gear is full berserker as a new player, you're just going to be a grease spot and everyone will hate you.
---
* Find a commander, stay right next to the commander at all times no matter what, join the commander's squad, stay right next to the commander at all times no matter what, *get in voice comms if the commander is using comms*, stay right next to the commander at all times no matter what, kill any enemy that comes in range, and stay right next to the commander at all times no matter what.
---
* If you see a piece of siege sitting around, walk up to it and hit F twice. You just refreshed the auto-despawn timer on that siege so it'll remain available to your team longer.
---
* If you see a big lever sticking out of the ground labeled as some sort of 'tactivator', stay away from it and absolutely do not touch it. Much, much, much later you'll learn what they do, when they should be used, and when they *really should not* be used.
---
That's pretty much all there is to it.
---
/u/TheThreeThrawns

I really hope for the WvW playerbase that you get more players who take the time to pick good specs (which are 3 sadly as far as I know) and gear them correctly. We already know how the "pve casuals" think about meta builds.

---
How do you suggest to fix it? The maps are tiny. The objectives are poorly differentiated. There are few to no combat roles, and the ones that exist are mostly limited to one build of one spec of one class. How messed up is that now?   
---
Make a 10x10 kilometer map with mounts allowed (but tweak some mechanics from PVE, like drastically reduce mount health so dismounting people is viable), implement at least 5 new types of objectives (and not just "small castle", "larger castle", "really big castle), make all supply caravans manually driven but have way higher impact (similar to ANT in Planetside), implement new unique types of global utility for every class.  
---
So basically the solution that actually fixes WvW boils down to "make a new game". 
---
Doesn't help when you don't have a clue what specific slang means, or when they call out a place you never heard of/memorized.
---
Ele staff with survivable dps (can go core as well).
---
Long range aoes can scare opponents , and good long range aoes can destroy opponents as well as siege.
---
You also have water fields that you can blast, or let other blast them for massive aoe heals.
---
Learn how to run with the zerg and not die, so avoid pure glass cannon builds at start perhaps.

&gt; gliding included
---
Tell that to all my alts that fell to their death and ended in a bloody puddle because I didn't learn the WvW gliding skill on that character ... no gliding in WvW is not account-wide, you need to spend at least one WvW ability point on the "[War Gliding](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gliding#Mechanics)" skill line.
---
WvW ability point **totals** are account-wide, yes. WvW ability point **distribution** like I said, is not, you can have one character be a supply saster, and the other be a catapuld master with no points in catapult usage. That's what I'm wondering about, gliding doesn't use up any UI space or special hotkeys, mounts do.
---
Fuck you, imbecil.
---
People don't know what they will like until after they like it.
---
The mount itself I wouldn't agree is content, but if there's associated gameplay activity that's required to unlock the mount then that's something I would consider content. If it's just like unlocking WvW gliding where you open up your UI and spend World Ability Points then that's going to be something of a wash in regards to content.
---
I'm hoping there's something more in depth to unlocking it than just spending currency. Opening up the WvW abilities pane and spending 60 WAP is like three seconds of effort at best unless you've not set foot in WvW before and then it will be a few days of grinding ranks presuming boosters, the event buff and dedicated play time.

i use staff for loads of long range aoes as well as a lot of "movement" cc.

Usually i stay in fire mostly, switch to water when i need healing or conditions removed, air staff auto attack is great for bouncy tagging mobs and some cc, earth i usually use to place a wall mobs cant pass.
---
You can do all sort of tricks with ele, including starting with earth and placing unsteady ground between you and the group of mobs. Switch to fire and start casting aoes and obliterate everyone before they know what hit them.

This kind of playstyle is even more rewarding when in a group , events, or meta events where others take the aggro and you just blast everything to dust from far away :)

My main character since launch has barely any reasons to visit core tyria anymore and I wish that were different.

Plus, this system extends beyond tyria into all current, new and upcoming maps.

I don't know what to say, you want to nerf diversity and that's as retarded as it gets for me.

It's actually just a high tension steel slinky. 
---
If you are fighting in an enemy keep, the mount helps you more than the enemy. The enemy players have to run back from a close spawn WP, your players will run back from SMC at best (in which case you likely don't need help) or your corner keep or even spawn. The further you run, the more valuable the mount.

It's an almost daily occurrence in EB.  And if SBI's in the matchup, for some reason, it happens frequently even in smaller fights.
---
When the server recovers from that lag, sometimes everyone on the map gets "server quickness":  everyone, including NPCs, attacks several times faster than usual for a few seconds.  Don't think zergs really notice that as much since server quickness happens when their fights end so they won't be using many skills, but roamers definitely do.  Ranger LB auto attack shoots faster than Rapid Fire.  Channel skills will have about a third of their regular casting time.  Pulsing aoes only last a fraction of their usual duration.

I assume their DPS against a gate will fall somewhere between PvDoor and a ram, it's also possible the gate siege ability will require supply to use (and if it doesn't, it could be added later).
---
Keep in mind mounts have health bars that can't be healed in combat, so any mount besieging a gate should be easy to dismount using an AC, with the added bonus of knocking the players on the mount down when dismounted, setting up a kill.

Swapping some zerker pieces for something else is fine if you need a bit more survivability. Not everyone can play or wants to play Dodge Wars 2 and that okay. I personally run full zerker weaver most of the time, but that isn't for everybody.
---
A couple pieces to boost your defense/hp is not going to change that you have to learn your enemies patterns and weaknesses, but it does make it easier to get to the point where you can take a couple extra hits while you are learning. 
---

Have you ever created your own squad with your own rules?

All the pirate weapon skins are great, but the sceptre is my favourite. I’ve used it in my necromancer ever since I got it!

I think will get more people to leave than it wil...

Here you go. My reasoning. You even responded to it.
---
36 for the first tier of the achievement line, 90 for getting the last one and ultimately the title.
---
You can carry 30+ people with 5 (but only because it's the same situation on opposite side) and 1 dead = 1 rally in wvw (and probably pvp) for years already.
---
The issue is finding those 5 since players are quitting and/or avoiding (bandwagoning) dead weight players.
---
Which they "forgot" to discuss with players. Another changes of Chrono? That's gonna be "great"
---
You will probably pray for it to happen next Tuesday.

To be fair - if you jump into a pve raid / high end fractals or pvp premade group without first looking up what you're supposed to be doing you'll get kicked too. There are a lot of resources out there that will help with builds / tactics (metabattle, builds.vabbi.org, most servers have a community discord that has sections specifically catered towards new folk etc). There will normally be at least one pug tag on maps (at least during na prime / on more populated servers) that will take anyone - just look for a squad that has a large mix of guilds / guild less people. A lot of times when a group runs open they will advertise their voice comms - if you get in there will normally be people who will walk you through some basics on how to get up and going.
---
You mean : nerf update/make you quit update 
---
Balance around hi-end content for PVE? Doesn't seems to be THAT hard since we have like 9 classes, which have their own roles. Even WoW have more classes than GW2 and you says that GW2 crazy hard to balance?
---
Balance around ranked for PVP? Balance based on players response for WvW? Crazy hard indeed yeah
---
Hello there, i and my fellow Veterans can answer this strawman for you. WvW used to be really well populated actually and then Anet added things without thinking about the impact on gameplay and then ignored the problems to this day. Hope this helps.
---
I just use the spearmarshal’s plea that instantly teleports you to vabbi which unlocks the beginning WP to the area. You can then do the same thing you’re doing and back track/tele through the maps. 
---
I would imagine that once you unlock it in WvW, it gets unlocked in PvE part as any other mount unlock there.
---
You know one thing that I hardly ever see. That mount won't bring PvE players to WvW permanently. Nor will it bring in all those people who say they will magically start playing WvW. You don't play it for a reason and that mount probably won't change much apart from the new smell for the first week or so. You will still get ganked/1 shot(well 2 shot) if you solo in your glass gear. You still need to run while you might feel it's faster zergs/groups will also move faster. You will still be the first to die if you can't play. The list goes on. I'm sure people will hate on this comment but in a few weeks WvW will be back to it's stale self.
---
Chairs are amazing new technology, that isn't fully understood yet, but eventually your characters will be able to sit in a comfortable position! :D
---
I've stopped playing for a year to go to college, but your metaphor is not far off, haha. When I quit it was the new reward tracks. 
---
I think his point is the freedom to speak doesn't mean you should speak, especially on things that someone might have little clue about.
---
Pve goes anything you wish and think you can have fun with.
---
You can create a new character and try them out in pvp lobby where you have everything unlocked as lvl 80.
---
Otherwise guardians and rangers ,maybe also necro cores are doing great in pvp. For other professions youre much better off playing them with elite specs.
---
Paging Mister Moore... Will Mister Hugh Moore please come to the front desk?
---
I really like krytan weapon skins, they define the fantasy and realistic weapons imo
---
I quite like the flame legion and Ascalon armor skins.
---
but their comment is in a reply to a comment (not a reblog) and I have no clue how you can see them outside of the dashboard.
---
The reply (to one of the very first comments) says
---
It doesn't have any PvE-specific skills, but you can run around with it outside of WvW! :D
---
It's the same on riverside. But it depends on time. When there are 3 commanders online at 20.00 some are public, others aren't. Early in the morning or at night there is at best a public zerg.
---
My advice for WvW is: try to memorize commander names.
---
Guildteams can also sometimes be easily spotted bc of guildtags.
---
Memorize players who know their stuff at offtimes. Can be a good idea to stick to them or see when and where they use sieges etc.
---
Well no, it means you should not silence someone, you can speak back tho.
---
PvE can be done on anything, specially if in a group.
---
Berserker anything is always among the top choices for open world pve, but i see no reason why would anyone fear changing a few traits or a skill to be a bit better in open world environment
---
┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠノ)
---
Im a big fan of the Dragonfury spear. Looks neat, simple and somewhat practical for underwater combat.
---
I've never seen any interest in newer players other than getting them out of their flimsy builds.  
---
It is not content it is a feature that will bring people to WvW for a few weeks and after that we still stand were we were before, all those things that been game breaking for years are still there. Nothing have changed for WvW because they never adress the real issues. 
---
But.. they didn't highlight exact issues. They literally said:
---
&gt; Better class balance, the current meta is awful
---
&gt; Better siege balance. Trying to take a T3 keep is nearly impossible. 5 people can defend 50 on T3.
---
That's exactly what they said. Better balance (cause the meta sucks). Why does it suck? Which parts are good? Which parts are bad? He literally just said better balance, the meta sucks.
---
For siege balance he just says five people can defend against 50 (which is only true if the 50 people don't know what they are doing). A zerg with 50 people will easily take a keep from five if they use the siege correctly.
---
&gt;One of the biggest reasons why WvW is such straights is because no one wants to run for 3-5min to catch up with a zerg
---
Ok you found 1 good reason for the Warclaw and ignore every other negative side Effect that the Warclaw brings with it. OK let's put the other Effects aside and just Focus on the one you mentioned.
---
You basically want a faster way to catch up with your zerg. A permanent faster Speedboost Banner speeding up your movement at the start by around 60% would have been enough to do that (at least if the calculations further down the Thread are correct). If you get in Combat you loose your Speedboost and can only reaply it if you go back to spawn. Or you even get it instantly applied up on entering the spawn......
---
This would remove most of the negative Side effects the Warclaw brings with it.
---
Now let's just have a look at the negative Side effect the faster getting back to your zerg brings alone. (No Free Movement just getting back to the zerg)
---
Imagine besieging a T3 castle/tower the enemy zerg realizes that and comes to defend it. Now you will have an endless stream of defenders just trying to get your siege destroyed and if they succeed before you get the gate/wall open you have to rebuild and run out of materials at some point.
---
Let's say that isn't an issue as well and you kill the Lord and make it to the Tap Circle. Then 1 after the other Enemy will jump into the Circle and prevent you from making any Progress cause they will travel back to the Circle faster than you can kill all of them.
---
You will have and infinite Number of Bodys fighting against another infinite Number of Bodys just because ppl can Travel the distance faster than you can kill all of them.
---
At least it seems like that if the Travel speed will be as fast as we think it will be.
---
On the other Hand let's have a look why you even have to get to your zerg in the first place.
---
You just got into WvW and have to catch up to your zerg. Yeah a movement speed boost for that would be awesome  not gonna lie.
---
You just died and need to get back to your zerg. There we have to differ the reasons for your death.  
---
You died cause you were to far behind your zerg. This is easily avoided if you stay with your zerg and stop slacking.  
---
You died in even tho your were in your zerg. You want tell me ppl wont help you up???  
---
You died in your Zerg and ppl wont help you up. The only situation i can imagine that if your entire zerg dies as well and then you don't need to get back to your zerg cause the entire zerg will respawn with you  
---
You died and noon can help you up cause the fight is still going. Then you should get not movement speed anyway cause of the Problems it would cause i mentioned earlier.
---
I still think the more popular combo fields are still in use just as much as they were before.
---
nobody really used a light field back in the day for anyhting, in fact people avoided even using it and got shouted when they casted them over a fire field.
---
People used fire fields mainly for pre stacking might just as much as they do now, and they blast smoke fields for group stealth just as much as they have back in the day.
---
If you run around in a party of a few friends, or do like a 10 man guild mission, everyone still uses finishers on combo fields as far as ive noticed.
---
Yup.
---
Fortunately MY perspective of what is / isn't acceptable will apply to every group I lead. And whoever else tags up will apply THEIR perspective of what is / isn't acceptable to their lead. 
---
Now you can abuse their goodwill by not listening to a thing they say while stalking their group anyways; but it won't make them turn out friendlier towards your cause. 
---
If you think your perspective is more broad and amazing, find a commander that shares this point of view. Or tag up and do it yourself! **I won't stop you, I'll just not follow you if I don't want to**. See how simple that is?
---
But don't go crying about the 50 man queue when I kick your core ranger from my zerg. "Hmh I'm going to join the main blob on the biggest map because it looks nice and active, surely they'll love my SB/SB thief there right?" Certainly couldn't have seen that coming. 
---
Its not really a discussion you are after if you only want to hear from the ppl you agree with is it? 
---
Dont forget to reduce the visual effect. We havent had that for a while.
---
Why do I need years of WvW experience when I am not even talking about "what is needed" or what is "unbalanced"? All I know is that whenever I tried WvW, it was a terrible experience and that mount might still make me give it another try. You know that you need new players to keep that mode alive right? This is a huge part behind gliders and now mounts in WvW. To get you guys new players.
---
what I hate **the most** about german translations are the titles of TV series episode that **completely** spoil the whole episode. its so annoying. -.-
---
Q:  **What do WvW players actually want?** 
---
Honest A: To complain. The topic is not important.
---
The Prize is storm :)
---
Check out the vid for details!
---
Good Luck guys 🤞
---
Roamer can't ride mounts?
---
wELL pLAYED.
---
"Nice" things differ for players. For you is perfect, for an dedicated wvw player is not. Because the 2nd type is asking already years for some changes and they are getting ....mount. That is why so many  wvw-players stopped playing years ago. They realized Anet does not care about the mode they love and will never consider in a serious way their views. We still remember " I'm watching you guys violate my game mode" something Anet employ said while disrupting a gvg. I am sure you even do not know know what I am talking about. You must be just an offended PVE-player.
---
When gliding was added we had 70 man zergs to "fight" all night. 
---
And most of these groups would evaporate within 5 seconds of engage. No really, 5 seconds. Couldn't even tag them all before they were full dead. They literally couldnt' dodge twice before dying on impact. But because every single map is full and queue'd, there's also an infinite supply of these players. 
---
I wanna say it's fun but it's just .... mediocre farm ? At least now I get to jump my mount into them for added RP value. 
---
Ok in that case WvW will be a brand new content next week since the meta is going to change, the way we play is going to change completely and I for one as a WvW player can’t wait. 
---
Balance Change:
---
Mesmer: 
---
Mesmer is now unable to be played in Raid.
---
Well then have fun with that new siege mount. Maybe you even get a dolyak skin for it. God forbid gw2 players actually grow interested in wvw for whatever reason.
---
Thank you :)
---
WvW is a dead game mode, neglected by the devs. 
---
Is there any good build for Soulbeast Frontline in WvW (in zerg obviously) ? Cause I like medium armor profession but it looks like none are really wanted in WvW except medkit scrapper or learn staff Frontline Daredevil 
---
I hope it’s through the skill system I guess we’ll find out Friday. I personally am excited walking around is so first expansion 
---
I used to be an avid WvW player and stopped playing when the maps were updated and upgrades on things became more streamlined. It was great because it took a lot of grievers out of the game but took out a lot of strategy that went with rushing key upgrades.
---
WvW is a great gamemode that Anet has repeatedly shown to be out of touch with. I don't look forward to updates made to that game mode.
---
&gt; If they are serious about fixing it and prioritize the issue they should be done by now.
---
As someone who has actual experience with development and QA, I'll be over here laughing my goddamn ass off.
---
&gt; Visually, I LOVE the design! Baddass horned lion... beast! It reminds me of the black lion from the Black Lion Trading Company. I like how it looks a lot.
---
My first thought was "it looks like a Charr in heavy armor". :D
---
I'm coming with my zerk riffle warrior! &lt;3
---
Huh. GW2 players are so wild. Talking about damn MOUNT that's new content in mmorpg XD cool, really. Such content. 
---
Meantime wow and ff14 makes another ~20 raid bosses.
---
Gw2 community is so pathetic
---
I mean I just that I used to play Rev Hammer in WvW but for PvE I don't like Power Rev. So I wanted to try something else. 
---
And with the new mount and maybe other changes (we never know) I really wanted to invest time in WvW.
---
I guess I will train as a Staff Daredevil it's seems more skilled than thief usually is. 
---
I hate them all. Currently I only run TP for branded shards.
---
Hah, i didnt actually have that one even though I believed I had all karma skins. Thanks!
---
OHMYGOD ARENANET YOU NERFED MIRAGE TO THE GROUND WTF DED GAME ALL MY FRIENDS ARE LEAVING
---
Jokes aside, I love the shatter rotation in raids, please just... it needs a nerf, but don't kill it. After they killed staff weaver mirage remains the only DPS class I genuinely enjoy grinding.
---
Ha ha ha, so funny mate. 
---
Never seen this before - looks great! 
---
There's gonna be a lot of the salt here for a week + given what's being affected and when anet announced it. You might want to come back after the balance patch has been here for a few days/only skim the titles if it's a bit too full of it for a bit.
---
Because pvp isnt about fighting scripted bots. You have ffa arena and custom games for practicing as well.
---
&gt;Comms would regularly lead, announce their leads and even provide training raids. Hell even discussion points and meetings before reset on fridays was common in EU.
---
This never happened in my experience while on JQ while it was T2.  If it happened then it was via guild-chat/guild-discords.  WvW on NA has always just been super exclusive -- you're either in a notable guild or a "useless" rallybot pug.  I've never felt like communication extended beyond guilds or was accessible to anyone outside of them.  It was incredibly frustrating. 
---
&gt; If a commander tags up for pugs and asks them to come discord; is this not you getting presented with opportunities to learn / train? If they also provide you with resources, ~~builds~~ and ~~callouts for what they're trying to do~~... Are they not teaching and training players? What more do you want them to do?
---
As you said, I want them to explain what we're doing, what's going on, what our objective/goals are.  That's never been anything that I've experienced in WvW on NA.  It's fine to provide people with builds, but without the context of how to use them in an organized contest with an organized squad you may as well just be running around in Tangled Depths or the Straits of Devastation.  
---
&gt;If people actually reached out to wvw players to talk the broad sentiment is that this announcement was tone deaf after all the discussions we’ve had, that we hope the balance patch is well thought out and includes the list of changes that would help the game mode, and that we are still looking forward to alliances as something that might spark interest in this game mode.
---
PvE has been asking for new dungeons forever as well and there are no signs of any in development. To me, it just feels like the wvw community is currently throwing a fit in the faces of literally the only guys that try to take care of that game mode. I dont know all of the wvw communitys demands, I just know that this mount has the potential to break your dusty flagship setup with sheer engage power alone. You dont know if the gatebreaker ability is strong enough to ruin sieges or if the devs would be ignorant enough to let it stay that overpowered for long. You dont know if roaming dies or if the mount even makes more classes and builds viable roaming options. You just know that you will get new content and that you are scared of the consequences.
---
Your unbelievable. You'd rather continue bickering and throwing a tantrum than talk about the game, or it's aspects. Did you watch the WoodenPotatoes video I posted or listen to any points made?
---
Listen, i know your feelings got hurt, but i have nothing to do with this. Please, consult a specialist.
---
So when you jump back in again and realise that the ballance in WvW is out of hand. The server lag is still a big issue. Night cap in EU is still a thing and there is still no reason to win the weekly matchup no a reason to take or defend a keep/tower. You get a champ bag if you kill the lord other then that nothing. This and more will still hunt you as a wvw player every day or ever time you enter.
---
WvW has seen a lot of updates over the years. EotM was built as an overflow map designed to solve the queue problems GW2 saw back at launch (primarily for the Chinese launch of the game as by the time EotM came out, most servers had at least one borderland without a queue).
---
The lake on Alpine Borderlands was filled in with the ruins as they exist now (designed for roamers and duelers to fight over), there used to be an orb mechanic at the northmost point on the map (removed and replaced with bloodlust), the Desert BL was released.
---
WvW got siege masteries which enhanced siege abilities and came with WvW ranks and rank up chests. They added tricks and traps. They added gliding to WvW.
---
The ticket vendors from WvW tournment seasons brought an exclusive upgradable weapon set, they've also released tiers of an exclusive WvW armor set (which is addition to the original WvW skins). They've since added another weaponset to the vendor.
---
They added reward tracks, they added pips and reward tiers (with some very solid rewards).
---
Probably the biggest change the game will ever experience in the works for WvW with the alliance system and server restructuring that is going to take place when it's ready. Nothing like that has happened since megaservers replaced PvE servers but megaservers used server allocations and never had to figure out how to balance population participation with guild affiliation and times like the alliance system will attempt to do.
---
WvW has gotten a lot of the years, but the nature of the game mode means too many changes would alienate people who mostly want the game mode to remain the same. PvP content relies heavily on game balance more than new maps or new features, while the latter can help keep the experience fresh (like the warclaw might), game balance and player interactions are always going to be the core of the game mode.
---
It'll be 11 weeks after the previous patch, but there were roughly 2 weeks of holidays and a week or two of Jormag attacks on the Anet offices in that window.
---
So about 7-8 weeks of development time, which is pretty close to the cadence we've been seeing for balance changes.
---
Every community has whiners.  Right now the WvW whiners are drowning out the PVP whiners and the raid whiners.  Which is a major balancing issue Anet *consciously decided they wanted and continue to struggle to manage.*  GW2 isn't one game, it's *three* - PVE, PVP, and WvW - and any attention paid to one mode is met with cries of neglect by fans of the other two.
---
Games with a more coherent play experience don't have this kind of cultural problem, and from a development standpoint that's something you have to consider, and something you have to devote resources to - not just "what kind of game do I want to make?" but also "what kind of community do I want to foster and interact with?"
---
Realistically ... you are wrong. You could be right if the wvw-players never buy anything from the gem store.  I am sure that average the wvw-players buy as much as any other player in the game.
---
I have never bought with real money that many gems for anything else but transfers. Just to be with my gvg-guild. WvW was not profitable at all back then. After Anet did their best to destroy the mode and most dedicated wvw-players stopped playing at all GW2 - well probably they lost some fresh cash.
---
Also the wvw-mode does not cost them that much. If anything at all most of the time. They barely do something about this mode. Probably Anet already  years do not have any dedicated employees to it. That is why they come up with "genius" ideas like mounts when no one has asked for them . It just screams - I am new to this area, I have even never been in wvw but I have to come up with something new about the mode. Let me think: oh, wvw has no mounts...now players know we think about their beloved mode. Ez... job done. Now back to LS because we will deliver not 85% map but 60%. And this time also the blind fan base will see we skipped a lot of work at the new content...
---
[Ruinmaker](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ruinmaker) is so good!
---
[Jora's Defender](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jora%27s_Defender) and [Kryta's Embrace](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kryta%27s_Embrace) for that old school RPG feeling.
---
As a Holosmith, my ideal new elite spec would be Holomancer, which is exactly like Holosmith except with a different name.
---
But honestly, it's really hard to come up with a new Engi elite spec. If you ask for something supporty you condemn Scrapper to eternity in unusedville because Scrapper is presently the third wheel on the Inventions + Alchemy support bicycle. Holosmith is already handling power and condi, which doesn't leave many options. I guess a dedicated condi spec with high DPS but a slower build up time than Holosmith's burning damage might be alright.
---
I put thousands of hours into WvW over the course of the game. I haven't played much the last happy a year, but I don't think I ever saw anyone that mentioned wanting mounts in WvW. Might just be the servers I was playing on, might not.
---
PvE tome? As in, tomes of experience?
---
i think its supposed to be a train mount which the zerg can get onto while the commander controls it, not a bad idea i'd say.
---
Yeah wvw speak for themselves
---
I don't think so, because Mounts don't have much hp, so knocking someone from his Mount shouldn't be that hard. 
---
Also it brings a whole new dynamic into the game where a players chase each other on mounts. 
---
And who knows how the chain skill will work on players. Maybe you will be able to dismount other players with this skill. Either immediately or by slowly decreasing the Mounts hp, so you have to stay in range, both would be amazing.
---
&gt; Support WvW by becoming a casual. Dont' lead pugs, don't organise communities, don't put any effort in. That's the GW2 way.
---
Christ, i'm not a defeatist but this clearly is what WvW is supposed to be, according to Anet's actions: Nothing.
---
Do you know how roaming/ganking works?
---
One day, someone will claim 'freedom of speech' and actually know what it means
---
Which is why the community has a discord where the leaders of the community can discuss and put together our requests for the devs to see. 
---
While its a shame that was your experience, I can say just about everything you said here either isnt typical or isnt true.  Most commanders are perfectly fine with pugs, especially if you are running a meta build there should be no issue.  Assholes exist everywhere.  
---
If you want to learn to roam, just do it.  Get a build you are comfortable with and set foot.  You will get run over a lot, but the only way to learn is to get out and do it.  It will make you a better player.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/asm46y/_/egv7tlj
---
Perhaps you want a screenshot from me upvoting that commment? 
---
No. Most of us said "keep them out." The maps are infinitely small for mounts.
---
&gt; failing to provide for newer players
---
I wrote and updated class guides and builds for my WvW forum for two years straight, hosted vocal training courses on the weekends and answered hundreds of questions regarding the Warrior and Guardian classes on multiple forums. That was back when each server had its own, living, community.
---
More recently I lead a training raid group every friday for about 6 months. 
---
Please, tell me more about how I fail to provide for new players, while litteraly half my playtime was dedicated to transmiting and helping new players get into WvW and raids.
---
But apparently that's never enough and it's always the veterans' fault. Did it ever occur to you that maybe it's the new blood's fault for not caring, not looking for ressources and feeling entitled to the rewards? Or even Anet for leaving all the work to the player base? Learning, training, even the damn tournaments and GvGs are hosted by players ffs.
---
But do you think players who love the mode need these random people who know nothing/little, care not and are just here for the rewards? ...  with the attitude " you do not tell me what to do or not. I have paid for the game, I will play it as I please Do not care about your fights or server"... 
---
&gt; and thus pushing devs away
---
Devs are paid to do a job. A job they should do well. This garbage argument of "Oh, but bad feedback makes devs run away" is exactly that: Garbage.
---
They're PAID to listen to feedback, use their experience and deliver a good game. WvW is but NOTHING of that. It's been a mess ever since it's inception, and that's SEVEN YEARS.
---
The WvW community bled out for SEVEN years. They got small updates to keep them reeled in, the biggest changes had positive shortterm pop increases, until people realized the game mode itself was in a worse state ( condi cap, gliding and all the bugs, glitches and defensive capabilities it gave you in an game mode that ALREADY favoured Defense ), then the pop dwindled to way smaller ammounts.
---
Anyone, ANYONE who thinks that WvWers are "whiny" clearly has no idea of the history of the gamemode.
---
S E V E N F U C K I N G Y E A R S.
---
I don't think rifle or pistol need reworking. Rifle's essentially a shotgun and the closest thing core Engis have to a melee weapon outside of kits, while pistols are your defacto condi choice. They both feel pretty good to play with so long as you're using kits, and if you don't want to use kits there's always sword Holo. Emforay216 has a point on the lack of direct ranged weapons though, the only real options we have are nades and mortars, both of which struggle to hit a mobile target.
---
Hey, so PoF is not required to use it outside WvW?
---
I agree
---
It's not the same thing. There is great concern about how this will affect the roamers. Imagine being chased by a zerg on mounts. Also, the people are right when they say that the priorities are wrong. Is the mount a priority when the META is so terribly restricting? When the servers have so many problems? When there are so many things to fix? 
---
The same goes for raiding and fractals, so yes they should respec. Just because you can drop in and out of WvW at will doesn’t make your pve minion necro build work in the wvw environment.
---
The stats don’t overly matter because their skill will not be sufficient anyways and they will freeze when tunnelled or make basic errors of judgement in a fight and die regardless.
---
Help the WvW players make obtaining this mount fast for you by helping them do what they do best: kill each other and take points. 
---
Treat entering WvW as your first fractal or dungeon or raid: be a sponge and learn th maps and what does what and just keep up with your commander. We all want to have fun so do your part and they will do theirs, good times all round
---
So why complain about the mount at all? Mounts have their own devs designing them, not the people working on WvW's new alliance system. This is literally something shiny and new that cost the WvW community nothing - it's even coming with a balance patch the same day!
---
Well sure.  If you are solo then run whatever the hell you want.  The post you replied to was about zergs though, so I am not sure why you disagreed with anything he said when the context was referring to zergs and running off meta builds.
---
Btw, the implemetation will be awful.
---
We all know it. Gliding was, Condi cap was.
---
I've been dumbfounded by how many posts I've seen saying "I don't play WvW, but this looks awesome! Why are they complaining." Then then WvW players tell them why we're upset they just get argued with like we should be grateful for a mount that is just going to make lag issues worse.
---
I guess i have to add a few points on my wvw panel out of the thounseds and thousends being there totally unused for years and then i can use the mount. At least that is how gliding was implemented.
---
Or we are forced to do the jumping puzzled and try to find a npc that sell it to you for badges.
---
&gt; This simply can't work for fighting based games
---
Works for Planetside 2. An MMOFPS. And that has much greater need for precision then a tab targeting MMO like GW2.
---
Aint perfect by a long shot. But it only starts falling apart when you concentrate hundreds of players in a small area. I don't know what the max map population is in GW2, but I never saw a fight that I thought exceeded 150 players. I've seen fights of 500 in Planetside 2.
---
Point being that we have proof it can be accomplished. The question is whether it can be accomplished in GW2's engine without an enormous overhaul.
---
As a Warrior i would love a dual-wield greatsword spec for power dps in raids/fractals.
---
Dualwielding sunrise and twilight would be so nice.
---
My worst nightmare would be pistol tho..
---
That's a penis
---
&gt;  I understand it's a big job and it will take them time, it's not as easy as cooking a piece of fish.
---
They had seven years. Stop allowing this shitty behavior.
---
Maybe they meant literally big. The mount itself is big.
---
I sunk hella money into scribing out of my own pocket just to get this!! Beautiful skin 
---
I’ve been wanting this for so long. I really hope we get to see them when we eventually make our way to Cantha. 
---
There has been a great number of balance patches over the years, and the WvW META is stiill restricting and terrible.
---
The Underworld and the Realm of Torment are physically connected (as are the Underworld and Fissure of Woe) as we learn via quests in GW1, specifically [Imprisoned Spirits](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Imprisoned_Spirits). Recent lore suggests that all afterlives are more or less in the areas of the Mists surrounding Tyria, esp. as they don't have souls of other worlds in them.
---
Yeah, and people still bring the dumpster fire of an argument "oh, but bad feedback pushes the devs away"
---
Honestly, fuck that. They're PAID to do a damn job, they're not celebrities choosing their party groups.
---
IMO, all of the crafting discipline backpacks. They have great detail!! Especially the scribing backpacks. 
---
\&gt;getting into anything more than zerg vs. zerg is more difficult and exclusive to get into than PvE raiding.
---
There are a lot of casual guilds and communities that have a WvW day in their weekly schedule and that do play at small scale just for fun. Though the spirit for them isn't to "farm" but rather to have a fun group activity that anyone can join with pretty much no restriction in player count, gear or time.
---
The more casual communities I know tend to be much more enthusiastic about playing WvW than about raiding (that they find just frustrating).
---
Nowhere said this
---
&gt;level 1
---
I find that some exclusive textured dyes, like charred and flame, can make any cosmetic item look great.

---
Never seen Anet command a squad no. But I was talking about other player commanders
---
And this been true for...Seven years.
---
This would look good with the Aviators

---
And the solution is to buy the expansion.  Company exists to make a profit.
---
I have 2 accounts, but one of them has no expansions because its sole purpose it to make gold from dailies and mail it to my main.  However, if not having a mount proves to be an insurmountable (pun!) hindrance to enjoying WVW then I will most likely come off the money and upgrade.  For me, not a really big deal.
---
whats a good way to tag champs when farming istan as a ranger?
---
I will put the mount down your throat and you will enjoy it. 
---
Remember this one? https://youtu.be/9eeICU9d0ZI
---
Then you do what i do with PvE raids i do not join them. Even though there are loot i want (looking at you hammer mushroom!!!) or even raids i want to do (i am a old hardcore raider from other games) i simply can not raid because of the fact i can not devote long periods without being able to leave at any point because reasons that is about real life. That is why i quit the other game and why i do not raid or play gam modes were i am not able to click log out or go afk when ever i need. I do not feel entitled to that hammer, and i realise if i join anyway i might ruin the run for the people i go with so i don't raid. I am not entitled. 
---
Why are players who join WvW entitled?
---
Maybe this is why WvW is "dead," because you treat potentially new players of WvW like this. If you were a bit more welcoming maybe they'd be more inclined to stick around.
---
Not dead.” at all. Play it, join an alliance,  and you will see.
---
Mountskins were a huge financial success. It's no wonder they are adding them to WvW. Probably an easy patch to greenlight on company level - something you likely can't say for a range WvW-related stuff.
---
It's monetizable and might bring more resources to do WvW patches. Some people are gonna be alienated but at this point the community for WvW isn't exactly flourishing. A "ded gaem mode" makes little money to sustain it's development and this is what they are at least trying to fix.
---
The negative attitude among WvW:ers make them a tough crowd to please. And Anet probably is probably partly to blame for this. But, it ends up sounding like  "gtfo plebs I have been masochistically playing this game mode for years, blatantly ABUSED by anet and  without a doubt can tell you that this new content I haven't played is clearly retarded and designed as a slap onto my face"
---
Why. Do. You. Play. The. Game.
---
I don't see how a negative attitude like this has kept WvW players in the game so long. Just give it a chance. There is no obligation to play the game if you dislike it.
---
The fun part about this is the fact WvW is still one of my favorite modes. I just wish it got updated more.
---
&gt; I don't think dismounting people off of 5-8k health mounts would be a problem.
---
It will be if the mount even has a basic bitch raptor-like dash, especially if it also benefits from all of the mount masteries (and why wouldn't it with anet design philosophy?). 
---
People who don't dedicate their entire lives to WvW and who also play pve are allowed to have opinions on wvw too. Stop gatekeeping.
---
Legionnaire Axe
---
Yikes
---
Look, I’m just here to get my Gift of Battle.
---
i'm sorry what? how on earth would a thief be able to outrun a raptor?
---
Tough call, because I love very simple hipster style.
---
For weapons, I think I'm torn between the Iron Greatsword, which I feel just looks like a nice good old fashioned Claymore, and the Krytan Staff, which feels like a well designed fantasy weapon. The magic bit is elegant and complicated, but the rest is elegant in its simplicity. It looks like it could actually be used to block a blade or bludgeon somebody if they got close.
---
For armor, there's so many items that I think are less popular than they should be. In terms of what I'm most happy with, I'll go with Vigil's Honor Footwear. They actually look like good versatile boots for marching or traversing difficult terrain. The texture also doesn't feel abhorrently low. They may be more popular than I think though - not like I go staring at people's feet when I'm running around the world.
---
You always have to think about what the unintended consequences of a change like this would be. To me, the downside to this idea is very clear - people would start getting angry when too many people were in their group. Suddenly, this mechanic will create yet another excuse for people to yell at each other. "We can't catch this other group because of all these idiots staying too close to us". You get the idea.
---
Actual WvW player here.  And I agree.  There was a lot of doomsday typing in glider addition.  And broken stuff that needed fixing, but we're all acclimated and using it now.  Will be interesting to see how this is used, pushed to limits, broken and then fixed.  Meanwhile, what's going to happen?  People going to show up, learn something new, and keep playing - the actual WvW players, that is. 
---
If the bonus reward is only put towards t2/t3 objectives I don't think it would really be possible for eotm style flipping (aka what's just known as karma training in wvw) to be viable. It takes too long to build up to that point for a k-train to be able to capitalize on it. And either way it's not like I'm suggesting a massive improvement in the rewards: maybe just like a bonus 10% xp on t2 and 15% xp on t3 would do. Maybe even just limit that bonus to towers and keeps.
---
Just a non-zero *something* to match the increased importance of taking the stronger defense objectives. 
---
Guys, we don’t know if that’s the only change coming for WvW. There will be a full patch 26/02 that addresses WvW changes as well, you can put down the torches and pitchforks for a while. 
---
Maybe the little kitty is not the only change to WvW. 
---
It's still a darn shame we cannot get that skin as a Scepter.
---
Yeah, right about the time they nerfed staff ele into "shit tier" in an effort to make weaver "only somewhat OP" I decided to try mirage.
---
Since then it's replaced my 5 year old ele as my main in most respects.
---
A comprehensive, breaking, mirage nerf would really be heartbreaking. I don't care if they nerf it somewhat, but knowing ANet, it'll be all or nothing.
---
Expecting the next balance patch to look something like this:
---
-Meteor Shower now applies burning stacks instead of damage, increased CD by 50%, roots caster for 3 seconds after full channel.
---
-Lava Font CD increased to 10 seconds
---
-Jaunt reduced to 2 charges
---
-Tempest overloads now cause that attunement to go on CD until daily reset
---
-Using an ambush skill now costs 5g
---
-Chrono still meta, but needs a regear 
---
I simply don't care enough anymore to deal with bullshit classes like Mirage.  Getting run over isn't fun in any context whether it makes you a better play or not.  I think zerging is the least fun part of WvW and the rest of it is closed off to newer players.  Sure, you can roam, but unless you roam with buddies you're just susceptible to burst-condi bullshit. 
---
It's about making money. And that's not a shot against Anet, just reality. You can monetize mounts in WvW, but not so much perfect balance. WvW players likely aren't the whales, and making their game mode well balanced probably won't draw enough people in to bring in more gem store purchases
---
Longbow is a good option for power shortbow is faster attack speed though so i usually go with that.
---
it would be great if, as a warrior main, i really don't want to be the banner guy AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN..
---
ok, those are one of the best buffs in the game, but really, since we got HERALD i tought that finally someone could take this role from the class that should be the best cleaving dps in the game..
---
&gt; The non-WvWers need to stop these posts
---
This is simply absurd, there is place for both of those ideas.
---
WvW is not a closed environment, it is an area which constantly requires new players if you want to be able to cover your maps and have active groups fighting in all of them. Opinions of people who are not playing WvW but might actually try it (as nothing stopping them anyway) or an update that can introduce more people to WvW is just as important as another update that can help keeping both WvW veterans and new-comers alike, those two feed each other. 
---
People gatekeeping the mode and screaming "go back to your fucking PvE mode" are also part of the problem as in the end they will be the ones wondering why no one is in the map at all.
---
For the record, I have WvW'd before and now I do WvW though it is mostly roaming and trying new builds whenever I can find time to play.
---
&gt; How can zergs run over roamers if everyone is using the same mount?
---
If you are in combat, a passing zerg can't easily outrun you, because you can't mount up yourself.
---
&gt; In fact roamers are even faster than zerg players since mobility is main part of their kit.
---
On foot, yes. On mounts, no.
---
If people are miserable playing it then it is a failure as a game.  The compelling parts don't make it not a failure.  
---
WvW players have detailed vague complaints about balance (affects all game modes) and alliances (which has no estimated release set).
---
Detail specific concerns that would benefit the game mode, increase the population, and drive revenue towards ANet if you want to do something productive.
---
All I see is bitching
---
WvW is dying in spite of the fact that there are too few people like you, but yeah, victim blaming for the lose.  
---
Wvw was very boring because of the run to action and I will probably play it now. I love pvp and it’s gonna be awesome now. Bye speed rune
---
Okai thanks :) cya ingame buddy :)
---
You're exaggerating.  Gliding is absolutely fine.
---
Or a staff?
---
Thank you for adding revendication to my language usage. What a wonderful word! 
---
&gt; It only gets compounded by limited player slots in any given map, although I figure it's rarely a problem these days with how depopulated the play mode is. 
---
It's the opposite. The amount of "decent" commanders willing to lead pugs has gone down faster than the amount of pugs looking for a tag. Especially since, as comms quit more pugs looking for a tag become available. 
---
Despite queues obviously being more rare, a popular commander tagging on EU prime will still get pretty big queues on a LOT of servers. And when they get through that 50 man queue they throw a tantrum because they're not welcomed in squad on core ranger. 
---
-Tomes of Knowledge now remove a level.
---
&gt;Three months later...
---
-Tomes of Knowledge were being used to reduce characters below level 10 to repeat story missions for keys. To fix this problem, we've made being level 10 a bannable offense.
---
How dare you!
---
&gt; The only one that would matter is Enhanced Evasion;
---
And enhanced stamina regen while we are at it, which combine nicely too.  
---
Get them all. That way you can experiment you know.
---
Some random spirit from the mists.... a wierd one
---
as if the money is going towards WvW haha, nice joke
---
you know the mount will also be available in pve, right? your theory is complete rubbish.
---
At least they are trying to break the pirate ship meta  in some way...although it is not what they were thinking about. [Already invented.](https://clips.twitch.tv/ProudAlluringCockroachYouDontSay)
---
hyperbruh
---
Yeah I used to play WvW a ton back in the day, kind of stopped after DB died for like the 3rd time and the content wasn’t getting updates. I still love the mode but pve just has more things to do atm and I still need to find a new server when I have extra gems.
---
I’m willing to try the mount but i’m not expecting it to fix WvW long term as it’s more of a bandaid fix at that.
---
Aight, do ever bother asking someone if they can or cannot play anything else? Even if you do I can name you a few commanders on my server who don't and who post in squad message stuff like "rangers or thiefs will get kicked". 
---
And on your "make your own group" what is a newbie supposed to do with that group of his if he is not knowing the basics of when/where/why? What if what he is doing is against the ideas and plans of the proper commander resulting in the newbie leader getting flamed at?
---
In raids there are 10-20 raid groups open at peak hours and unlimited amount of instances that can be opened. In WvW you have 1 instance, 1 map, you can't find a map that will suit you, cause there just 1 map for everyone.
---
In the end of the day commanders act if their side is full of newbies all the time meanwhile the other server is full of tryhards all in comms with full meta squad team comps. Well "surprisingly" the other side is actually running the same thing as you, cause overall the playerbase is the same (with maybe few exceptions). If everyone agrees to give everyone a chance they guess what, sides would be equal (implying the match up was even to begin with and if it isn't that is a whole another topic).
---
Or maybe it is about how you read the post and how you read the chat? Because i was actaully thinking when i wrote it that i hope he will get back and tell. But hey you wanted it to be somethng else and there for you judged me.
---
If you want WvW to survive, you need 'average players who don't like WvW' to come back to the game mode. WvW needs to change. We don't know if this is the only change, either. This sub always explodes in panic or rage before we get all of the info, please stop. 
---
Good thing I'm almost 400 from eotm before they killed it :D
---
It's been over a year since the initial world restructuring announcement, but the last update was in July.
---
I understand that they were quite clear that this announcement would not be related to world restructuring though.
---
This patch:
---
-SoI will now activate one random unequipped mesmer skill on activation. All other effects are eliminated.
---
What would a staff skin do good for that matter? In which hand am I supposed to carry the torch then?
---
I just took your post as a opertunity to write the thoughts i had about it. I should probably been more clear about that.
---
I really doubt this is about monetization, considering how few people actually play WvW anymore. It would make way more money if it were a primarily-PvE mount. The conspiracy theories are getting really old.
---
Yeah I used to WvW a ton back in the day, kind of stopped after DB died for like the 3rd time and the content wasn’t getting updates. I still love WvW but pve just has more things to do anymore and I still need to server change when I have more gems.
---
I’m willing to try the mount but i’m not expecting it to save WvW or anything. At most it’s a bandaid fix.
---
:') 
---
^(this tin box always triggered me, it never had cookies)
---
'Because if you actually spent time...'
---
Except that WvW vets don't like to spend the time training newbies anymore, they just bitch and bitch and bitch while their game mode shrinks. 
---
I have many accounts were several have both or one expac but even thoug this is the case i still am able to realise that not everybody are able to buy the game and not everybody want to buy it. 
---
And then you say yeah but that is their problem, but it is not their problem it is the zergs problem because we stand at a fight missing out on 20 people who are running behind. So it will effect all of us.
---
&gt; And enhanced stamina regen while we are at it, which combine nicely too. 
---
What would give you enhanced stamina regen?  I *really* can't imagine that they'd give us the Crystal Champion abilities
---
&gt; Aight, do ever bother asking someone if they can or cannot play anything else?  
---
Yeah, like a few million times. You really think we don't ask? 
---
Have you ever tried to lead a map with a queue? Have you ever tried to lead 50+ players on discord with a full squad? You're getting whispers, talking in squad, talking on discord all while keeping an eye on the map status. This is outside of fights. During fights you obviously have even more to do, like leading. 
---
Personally, I don't have the time for this during my lead. I prefer to focus on trying to tell players how we should move, what skills should be used, how to coordinate, communicate with the rest of the group, etc. 
---
So it doesnt' suprise me that they use squad message to inform their players. They're LEADING actively which is a LOT of work. 
---
&gt; Even if you do I can name you a few commanders on my server who don't and who post in squad message stuff like "rangers or thiefs will get kicked". 
---
Names please. What server is this :o 
---
&gt; And on your "make your own group" what is a newbie supposed to do with that group of his if he is not knowing the basics of when/where/why? What if what he is doing is against the ideas and plans of the proper commander resulting in the newbie leader getting flamed at? 
---
Go to another map. Tagging over people is generally not considered respectful. You can also, i don't know, pm them and ask. "Hey can I also tag on this map?"
---
&gt; In the end of the day commanders act if their side is full of newbies all the time meanwhile the other server is full of tryhards all in comms with full meta squad team comps. Well "surprisingly" the other side is actually running the same thing as you, cause overall the playerbase is the same (with maybe few exceptions). If everyone agrees to give everyone a chance they guess what, sides would be equal (implying the match up was even to begin with and if it isn't that is a whole another topic). 
---
You're naive. At the end of the day the only servers who still have several good commanders are the servers who can actually get 50 players all in comms with full meta squad team comp. Because that's how these commanders and players enjoy playing. They WANT organisation, coordination, teamplay. That's what they enjoy.
---
If I lead, i like to have 50 players with a full meta squad team comp. And I like to play against 50 players with a full meta squad team comp. If my group is more than half random classes and players who won't listen, then I won't enjoy leading and I'll happily log off and do something else. And then they have no commander. 
---
&gt; In raids there are 10-20 raid groups open at peak hours and unlimited amount of instances that can be opened. In WvW you have 1 instance, 1 map, you can't find a map that will suit you, cause there just 1 map for everyone. 
---
There are 4 maps + eotm. There is just usually 1 map with the biggest / strongest group. And that group is usually the group of "elitists" because they perform by far the best, and people like to win. Who'd have guessed? 
---
Even if someone doesn:t like gw2 end game. I havent met 1 person who regrets them playing this game. If they reach end game they leave but the journey gw2 offers is one of a kind and i believe people appreciate that.
---
No scrapper or weaver or any other class than scourge- rev and guardian that are the holy trio right now. If you are new you might even enjoy scourge especially for the doublexp week because it has so many aoes so its easy to just stick with a commander and farm by just spamming wells around :) These 3 classes are for zerg play though, maybe weaver is good too but probably more roamer-related stuff
---
Great, thanks for the feedback :)
---
Now imagine if more people played, and people were not toxic and elitist to them and they stuck around because WvW is interesting.
---
Assess your own toxicity maybe
---
A lot of people seem to miss my P.S. and get very touchy about the elitist part, which somewhat proves my entire point of the post and results in getting a lot of downvotes. Please let me repeat myself. 
---
Newbies should absolutely look stuff up before trying the game mode, just like with any other game mode, it being fractals, raids, spvp, etc. I am not saying that is ok to enter WvW, join the tag, press 1, hope for the best and when stuff goes bad to whine. NO. But why wouldn't you want to give people a genuine chance of proving themselves and letting them actually improve and see for themselves what they need to change? Why wouldn't you give them the chance to experience the game mode as it should be? If someone literally has just a thief are you really gonna kick him? Well good luck getting that guy back into the game mode if you do it. As I said I am a raid leader myself and I for example would never kick someone for playing non-optimal dps class or spec. This is what I am against, but what a lot of comments here are proving to be the sad truth.
---
Developping GW2? Expensive.
---
Developping WvW? Expensive.
---
Running servers? Not really expensive compared to the development.
---
Imagine you had 27 healthy EU servers instead of 15. Wouldn't that mean more sales and better monitization? 
---
Oh wait that would require balance and health. 
---
P2W MMO's also have great monetization. But then they die because they're not fun. Meanwhile the most succesful competitve games are balanced and not P2W - because they get way more players they can send skins / packs / goodies to. 
---
YES. 
---
lol! thanks!
---
Definitely a great choice.  Somehow I always preferred Cobalt over the Joutun Greatsword though. 
---
Uuuuuhhhhhhhh UHHHH yeeaaaaaaahhhh mmmooooorrrreeeee YEEAAAAAAAAAHHH BAAAABY givve it to meeeee
---
-Fanboi detected
---
There are no women allowed in the flame legion?
---
You will be unmounted on taking some amount of damage most probably and wont be able to mount up in combat just like pve. No roaming will not be killed. And even if does get killed i wont mind since its no less than aids rn with 1 shot, perma stealth, cc lock builds that exploit range and ooc to kill not actually fighting.
---
If you want to explore the story/world you definitely will want to start from level 1 and do the story in order. Keep an eye out for the ambient quests/events because they can tell some great stories as well. You can often help someone out, watch them talk with some people, and then continue to help them as they do more stuff. Read the bit about chained events here:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dynamic_event
---
The elite specializations don't unlock until level 80, and you will need to be level 80 to do anything in the expansions so it's not worth buying them until you get there anyways.
---
Mounts/gliders can't be earned until 80.
---
You then post a picture of your cod to instagram. Now groups of new people come check out the restaurant, and on top of that the entire meal was free.
---
IIRC the gems would cost more if you bought them separately, it also comes with some goodies like a convenience crafting location (lily of the Elon)
---
Sorry I don't have the details in front of me so I'm not sure.
---
If you are more of a ranged class person you might want to consider scourge as its also in the holy trio right now. You can spam wells and condis and never die if you are in a zerg, its very effective especially for the doublexp week coming up - I'm even gonna switch to it from my guardian for just that week. You can just tag a lot of enemies and much easier too! I'm also NA if you need help or more people in the group for hero points :) 
---
I think anet can do whatever they want with wvw as long as they continue to balance and support it regularly. 
---
I am afraid that Anet just releases a mount and leaves it there for a couple months while players find abuse exploits constantly.
---
Black and abyss are perfectly fine for that.
---
This has been done, multiple times, in all sorts of various spots. People like to ignore it because I guess it’s a meme now to laugh at the salty WvW players. 
---
Even when there is some truth behind these "suggestions", the overreacting manner in which they are presented all but guarantees their total lack of usefulness.
---
Yeah, I just don't like non-standardized pvp, and I resent the current generation of elite specializations too so that probably plays into it.  I can understand why some people welcome 1vX fights, but they aren't for me unless playing with or against friends. I hate having to make long treks back and forth, and try as I might I just can't get into it. 
---
I'd suggest you try it out at least, there's no way for any of us to tell you what's gonna be the most fun for you. Personally, I've had a lot of fun playing weaver, though you should keep in mind that it plays differently to the rest of the classes. You're quite squishy, so you should stay off tag - that's where most of the enemy DMG will be. As a general rule you will be mirroring your commanders movement.
---
That's because the leadership has a responsibility to make money. No money, no game, no ArenaNet. I know it's all fun to complain about "greed" but running an MMO is expensive and ArenaNet doesn't pull in monthly fees that provide a lot of funding for helping maybe the game and paying developers
---
GameDevs are expensive, as are writers and artists.... At into the mix traditional system administrators, network administrators, and traditional software devs... Many of which are even more expensive than GameDevs... And you can't run a business in interns either.
---
i recommend leveling up to get a feel for the game.  the expansion only come into play at lvl 80 (they come with a lvl 80 booster but i don't recommend it unless you already know what you're doing)
---
you get a mount at the start of the PoF expansion
---
it's best to level up crafting alongside your character (leveling crafting gives xp for you char), high level crafting requires doing endgame for the more optional stuff.
---
ps: tho they're still a great xp source and i recommend doing it, it doesn't provide enough xp to get to level 80, it's generally better to level up by exploring then by grinding mobs
---
Doubt thr wvw mount is going into pve bud, no point in using it there.
---
Whispers weapons are pretty awesome. Especially the staff and trident.
---
OP does not state that reshade 4.1.1 does this. He states that gw2hook 1.2.1 does this. 
---
I suggest that he tries reshade 4.1.1 and see if the same result appears, if it does, then the result that we get is the issue is local to the machine rather than to any reshade fork. If that makes sense 
---
Now imagine - once upon a time more people played WvW. 
---
People were not toxic and elitist to them. We nicely asked them to reroll. 
---
They told us "fuck you this is gw2, I bought the game and I can play whatever I want". Because they came from openworld PvE, where this is all true. They did this in such huge numbers (WvW reward update + gliding) that it killed off many of the smaller and more casual communities. These struggled to play together because of the sheer amount of players willing to join the group, but not interact or cooperate with them.
---
Many of the nice players had to become less nice to enjoy their gamemode, or quit. The more quit, the more the stress on the rest of the gamemode increases. 
---
Why do you think there's so many "toxic" groups and so little "non toxic" ones. Have you considered you should assess your own toxicity? 
---
Sorry, I wasn't asking for MORE vague complaints
---
Mimimimimi
---
I’m not really seeing your point. You’re starting with an assumption then trying to prove that assumption right. Fact is a lot of things can turn out badly but they can also turn out to be pretty cool. Acting as if warclaw has been released and has ruined all that you love about WvW when you’ve only seen a 40 second teaser makes no sense.
---
&gt; You will be unmounted on taking some amount of damage most probably and wont be able to mount up in combat just like pve.
---
That's exactly why roamers will be at disavantage against zergs, especially while they are in combat and they get runned over by a zerg train.
---
&gt; And even if does get killed i wont mind since its no less than aids rn with 1 shot, perma stealth, cc lock builds that exploit range and ooc to kill, not actually fighting.
---
Not everything is like that. Issues like this could be fixed with balance, not killing roaming. Some people prefer to play in small organized groups rather than following a big blob commander. Why force everyone to zerg?
---
Damnit ArenaNet. WvW is such a unique experience with the combat system in this game. It doesn’t need nearly as much content as PvE. Large scale fights are extremely fun and yet the vast majority of people I have gotten to know in WvW have quit over the years because of a constant ignorance by the developers about the gamemode and the issues it faces. They simply do not play it, which is sad because organized WvW fights are the most fun I’ve ever had in a game.
---
1. Start playing unranked pvp.  Get experienced in fighting other meta classes and know their weakness.
---
2. You will get lot of tomes from pvp. Use them to level your rev(zerg damage), guardian(zerg support) or ranger(solo play). I would advice you to level one of zerg build because there would be lot of people and zergs next week.
---
3. Also dont forget to unlock trait lines which will be used completely before going in wvw. Don't handicap yourself from the beginning.
---
4. Start informing yourself about builds and gear through friends, websites etc. Learn to play those builds and try going in wvw and trying them out with and commander with open tag. Use sigils that suit your playstyle and enjoy.
---
Also i think ranked pvp is better for ascended armor than wvw.
---
wvw is not yours either, and we're not entitled to care about you just like you don't about us
---
*How dare you consider that I should adapt for the content rather than the content be tailored around my needs* /s
---
i am not a wvw but:
---
why does cash have to come from wvw to go into wvw? it makes no sense..one could argue about metrics and all that but i'm pretty sure the money isn't managed this way
---
what makes wvw so unique that it requires separate monetization? people assume pve is monetized the most but the gemstore is overall universal..for instance, you can buy the [insert name] gloves/helmet to use in any game mode and people do just that
---
most of the irl golds come from pve because it's the most popular game mode with the highest overlap..there are so many people that never touch wvw and pvp but almost nobody skips pve completely
---
so to sum up, i consider the issues of mounts and wvw improvement unrelated
---
I still don't see where mounts have role in this. You can get rolled over by zerg anyway.
---
The free to apply armor from the Hall of Monuments.  The heavy male chest is still my favorite in category.
---
yes please.
---
I loved using the [Whisper's secret pistol](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/thumb/2/2c/Whisper%27s_Secret_Pistol.jpg/800px-Whisper%27s_Secret_Pistol.jpg) on my condi engi. I wish it had a silenced pew pew though. That would make it so much better! 
---
We got enough posts about this, thank you we are aware of things.
---
Truthful rants? What do you mean I'm evil incarnate, singlehandedly responsible for destroying several communities and the sole reason WvW is toxic.
---
I agree with you that most players won't just play more because it now has mounts. But I do think players will stick around more if the gameplay improves. I don't think it will, but i'll keep my reservations till we get more details.

TL;DR: Revs were basically just dervishes anyways.

\###Godtouched - Elite Spec
---
\----
---
Developed by human Revenants to hold steadfast to their ideals of the human gods rather than the actual beings, they turn the stories of the gods into templates that Mist energies can fill to override the reality around them.
---
Charr Opinions: "Bah, I never thought I would submit myself to this, but the human gods do have power and I can at least believe in that."
---
Asura Opinions: "Certainly the metaphysical implications of temporary apotheosis is facinating, but did some of them have to come with the indignant addition of feathered boas?!"
---
Spec Mechanics: Godtouched have access to all 6 human gods as Aspects and can shift between them to change their abilities, focusing these aspects on the greatswords they wield to not only cleave and deny reality, but also focus the power of their belief.
---
\###Sample Weapon Skills:
---
Skill 2:
---
Aspect of Balthazar (Skill 4 Override): Trial By Flames - Establish dominion with a sweep of your great sword that creates a ward of flames.  Enemies who cross the threshold are burned and allies are empowered by Might and Quickness.
---
Aspect of Kormir (Skill 4 Override): Cleansing Truth - Channel the radiance of Kormir removing conditions from allies and blinding enemies.
---
Aspect of Lyssa (Skill 4 Override): Illusion's Kiss - Draw Lyssa's veil around you and stealth, your next attack is critical and deals increased damage.
---
Aspect of Melandru (Skill 5 Override): Mass Lignify - Stab your greatsword into the ground channeling Melandru's trial, slowly turning enemies into trees, stunning them.
---
\###Sample Utility Skills:
---
Heal: Gifts Within - Heal and gain boons depending on god aspect. 
---
Utility 2: Sublime Conversion - Convert conditions on you into boons depending on god aspect. (Changes all conditions into stacks of the target boon.) 
---
Elite: Form of the Gods - Subsume yourself with pure Mist energy allowing you to to transform into avatars of the Gods themselves, granting different effects per God Avatar.  Always deal delayed strikes of damage along with additional god effects.  (e.g. Balthazar: Burn and increases power, Lyssa; Gain Energy and increase Ferocity, Grenth; Poisons and increases Precision.)
---
\###Sample Traits:
---
Master 1: Armor of Sanctity - Take reduced damage from foes suffering from conditions, gain increased condition damage. 
---
Master 3: Test of Faith - The last attack on your Greatsword auto attack chain removes a boon, if a boon was removed this way your target is Dazed.  Reduced Greatsword skill cooldowns. 
---
Grandmaster 1: Vow of Devotion - Gain an increased damage bonus the more energy you spend in one specific God Aspect.
---
Grandmaster 2: Mist Maelstrom - Changing Aspects creates a storm of Mist energies around attuned to the god dealing constant damage and inflicting conditions.
---
Okay, but it also means any kind in roaming or punishment is basically nullified.
---
It’s already been confirmed to be in pve 
---
I'm not a WvW player, but a PvE player, and you got what you deserved.
---
Possibly even higher, both to act as a point sink and to force PvE players to put in a reasonable amount of time to unlock it. I'm thinking probably 10-20 for the first rank, which would unlock the mount in both PvE and WvW, with the PvE version unlocking its various skills through a standard Mastery and the WvW version unlocking them through additional points.
---
Alternatively, they could have the WvW skill set use a more conventional progression, and unlock the mount itself through a collection with an associated reward track, achieving a similar result without making the skill set too expensive. There are lots of ways it could work; I just hope I won't have to grind WvW for a month or more to get it.
---
XDD
---
of course that's also a reason without a doubt.
---
The deeper meaning of what you say is ...heartbreaking. All these years spent in joy, hopes, pain and thinking about my favorite part of the game... When the truth has been right before my eyes.
---
2 rocket boots, rifle 5, holo 2... Even blinks have higher cooldown and don't have any advantage over leaps on flat ground. Still has nothing to do with mounts.
---
Mmogamer article explicitly said that once you unlock it in WvW, you can use it anywhere else, just those skills won't be big use. But still there will be people who will love to use it just for show, I am sure.
---
Absolutely agree. I have spent in wvw over 4k hours and honestly...haven't seen anything done with it. When Anet wants to silence players by showing that they are working, they add some pve crap to wvw mode. In pve you don't need skill balance, everybody just care about killing npcs, otherwise in wvw or pvp. Problem is, you have to be skilled developer if you want to balance those game modes, you have to be able to see forward. Anet simply fails to do that. Not only they can afford to place good hardware so players would at least avoid skill lag in mass zergs, but they also put more ressure to their chicken farm servers. Dead game. 
---
I hope they make enough money off the mount skins for solely the wvw mount that it brings back more attention to the game mode and we start getting love again
---
On NA, queues aren't rare but that's basically because the players are all ending up flocking to the same servers even when undesired and clearly makes the situation worse for everyone involved on the server.
---
This comment still hurts me so much
---
I don't know about underrated, but I love Bonetti's Rapier. Been using it on my Weaver every since I unlocked that spec.
---
Only 3/4 of month, as one week you can grind with double xp :^)

---
Hello. You, me, my place? I'll make sure the beers are cold. (;

---
Anet actually confirmed this.

"All Necro damage skills deal half damage when you are above the critical health level. This allows for a better feeling of the thematic vision of inflicting conditions on oneself to spread them further and allows the Necromaner to become a true Walking half-dead Death".
---
Gliding *is* fine though. It makes desert BL bearable to play on.
---
Before you call me a dirty PVEr, I almost exclusively play WvW.
---
In what way, downvotes? Unfortunately I'm not trying to just be an asshole. The majority of complaints relating to the mounts are not valid
---
You're right. I'll just get the mount and leave the game mode to rot. Enjoy the loneliness.
---
Honestly, this line of thought is like going to a starving country and passing out free printers instead of food.

&gt; not wvw meta profession at all
---
I mean that's just not true. All classes that don't fit in the ZERG meta are stellar at roaming in WvW. They're great picks for ganking and high mobility. 
---
You should re-aim your complaints at Anet for not providing build diversity and balance because WvWers surely do want more of it and  I do not think anyone would be against taking thieves or rangers if they had proper builds that are beneficial to them (I know, my guilds have run rangers/thieves/engineers when they brought something useful). There's only a limit of slots in a map and if you're asking for the commander and squad to do you a favor by SUPPORTING you - if you're taking a part slot, they're allocating resources as in buffs, heals, boons, cleanses,etc for you - and basically creating the content for you by leading an organized force then you should accept the responsibility of bringing something to the table that is also beneficial to them. Maybe try offering scouting, there are some commanders that appreciate a good scout and will offer them squad participation in exchange of good intel.)
---
&gt;OP does not state that reshade 4.1.1 does this. He states that gw2hook 1.2.1 does this.
---
No he did not. Read again. It's clear that both gw2hook and reshade are doing this.
---
I just dont enjoy World of Warcraft anymore thats why i would like to test Gw2. In wow im more like a Pve player:)
---
The main complaint about balance is that balances for other game modes normally kill off classes / strategies in wvw for no reason.
---
* Distortion share used to be a great way for a small yet highly skilled group compete with larger groups.  Unfortunately, it was nerfed due to it being used to skip mechanics in pve
---
* SoI used to make it so that you could use mesmers to help keep up stab / quickness / resistance.  With the SoI change, mesmers have gone from having around 1 per 2 parties to 1 per squad, if that. Again, this was changed due to pve.
---
* Spellbreakers used to be a lot for bubbles, which again could enable a smaller group to take out a bigger unaware group if they got the drop on them, and rewarded good positioning.  However, it was nerfed due to pvp and now it's not really ran anymore.
---
* Same with scrappers - superspeed was nerfed due to pvp and replaced with something that only hits 5 targets, making an already niche class less viable.
---
* Epi got nerfed due to pve raids, removing one of the last reasons to go condi over power
---
Imagine if the pve raid meta was literally 3-4 chorno 5-6 weavers and an off class or two.  That's basically what wvw balance has become - all of the nerfs to mesmer and tome duration on guards makes 2 guards per party even more necessary to keep up stab and resistance. Because boons are harder to apply, scourges really shine, and stacking FB + scourge + a few revs / weavers / other off classes will beat pretty much any other comp. Yes, all game modes have issues with balance, but it often feels like wvw gets overlooked due to how badly balancing for other game modes can affect it.
---
As far as alliances go - it's one of the few things left that we see as something that can revitalize wvw. It has the potential to make guilds matter a lot more (giving people more guild pride, a place that there are other people that can work with them / more individual attention, more exciting guild rivalries etc) and mix up some stale match ups. It has a lot of potential, but as the months go by you see different wvw guilds slowly fade away, which induces anxiety that alliances might come too late.
---
Yep, my main Guardian has used the Lionguard Hammer for many years, keep thinking I should use another but non jump out to me, and it’s sort of fitting with the Norn and animal Spirits of the Wild.

1 less queue for us, 1 less clown going around
---
big win for us tyvm for leaving
---
Thanks for the info.  I now know I'm on the Sanctum of Rall home world that has medium popularity.
---
You have to think of it from a business perspective also, the addition of a mount could be just the start to many great updates because in order to add something into the game they have to monetize off of it (adding mounts to wvw)  so in turn since wvw will now make them money it could open up many new avenues and future patches for wvw.  Y'all need to chill, yall need Jesus.
---
You can play with only one friend. Pvp is dead for like 6 seasons now.

Peasant’s Solution
---
Why did they put a mount in WvW? Because lots of players there are on the basic package.  
---
Let's be honest, it's a bunch of guys on alternate accounts (free or otherwise). They either want a different experience on another matchup, or they want to spy on their enemies by joining their server. These are the two reasons to have alternate accounts on other servers.
---
Anet doesn't know that. All it sees is that there are many accounts that don't have expacs - and it is therefore sensible that it wants them to have to buy the expac for their alt accounts.  
---
I've done plenty of Daily Recommended Fractals over the years and opened the reward from it. I have yet to get a single Fractal Research Page, ever. What am I missing?
---
Without really knowing any french and just using google-translator; the "correct" translation would be "griffe bataille"?
---
idk, sounds weird...
---
Yeah I will be trying out different Reshade versions I guess, but I think I need the depth buffer info because I really want DoF to work. Temporarily on my old desktop with a different GPU (still nvidia though) so I can try and see if the same setup does the same thing first. Thanks!
---
Just so you know. I do invest in my respec. I do know the strats. So nah. I'm valuable when I'm around. But the attitude of the average WvW player makes me puke.
---
Add to that, experienced players can figure out if a big group is hiding around the corner just but lag.
---
If a decent comm tags during prime and they're not getting hard farmed, then I expect them to have a queue. 
---
When these mounts get added I expect my server to have 3-4 queues, and the more popular map probably between 50 and 100.
---
Flocking together of players on the same server / map is natural the moment you don't have sufficient comms left. Anyone who wants to follow a commander will go to the servers / maps where there is a commander. Why would they care for the health of the gamemode or overall server when anet and nobody else does? Better care for their personal enjoyment and bandwagon towards the server which is most likely to be active if / when you feel like playing. This is a casual game after all.
---
I mean let's face it, 40k+ on cairn and SH, 30k-35k on largos and 20k on matthias even in terrible pugs with 50% quickness and alacrity is just too much. It does need to be reigned in if any other condi class were to ever see use. But also renegade should be tuned down in order to make slb, FB and thief even remotely good.
---
Wow that's quality posting!
---
nice strawman while missing the point completely
---
I don't have issue with new players trying it out. I welcome that. 
---
It's less about how toxic the community will be and more about how brutal their experience will be. The mode doesn't separate veterans from noobs like PvP does. You may get thrown in and have a 30 man zerg running you over, followed by Deadeye insta-kills. 
---
I imagine it'll be like [war gliding](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_Experience#War_Gliding_Mastery), a low-investment rank mastery. Tier 1 would probably only cost 3 or so rank points and grant you the mount itself (and you'd be able to go back to PvE if you have no interest in playing WvW since anet has confirmed that it has no special skills or masteries in PvE). 
---
This would kill the game for me.
---
I did not judge that group harshly in any way at all.  I quickly realized the error of my ways and asked commanders if i could join.  I'm going to look into joining a more populated home world.
---
Hammer/Anchor was my favorite of the pirate set for a long time. 
---
No because you can never reach a mounted player on a mount.
---
I know, you know, but as a welcoming WvW main I'd like to include our new friends from PvE! Cause we're that wholesome n shit. 
---
First, nerf all the bullshit healing. 
---
Yu might wanna go Scrapper just for Hammer and yu can pretty much run Bomb, Tool and Elixir Gun kits.
---
It works extremely well because of the excessive amounts of damage mitigation from Hammer's Reflect, Evade and Block as well as Stuns, Lightning Fields, and most importantly, Whirl and Leap Finishers.
---
Scrapper hammer is a wet dream of Finishers for me, it has 1 Whirl and 2 Leaps, which is pretty damned strong if yu combo with the various Fields accessible through kits. 
---
Yes, and?

---
gallant sword, shield and greatsword. currently weilding it right now with the new logan skin. it looks absolutely stunning! ditched my sunrise, shining blade and shooshadoo for it
---
I agree, everyone deserves to see that. wholesome WvW community
---
Almost every core spec is going to get outpaced by elite specs, so unfortunately engi isn't alone in that regard. There are some core specs that can do okay (Mesmer isn't bad), but the main problem is that elite specs add a lot more to classes without taking much away in return.
---
Back when I played a ton of core Engi (keep in mind, this was in pre-HoT), pistol/shield was a good choice if you felt that you were going to get abused by power builds. If you feel safer, pistol/pistol will give you more condi DPS with blowtorch, and toolkit will give you a block.
---
Honestly, I'd just experiment in unranked matches and see what you perform better with. No sense in playing one over the other if it doesn't click with you.
---
Right there with you:
---
&gt; Defending is too strong, T3 keeps and tactivators need a tuning.
---
EWP should appear along the outer wall. It takes so long to take a T3 keep outer  THEN inner to have enemies show up 10 minutes later with 50 ppl RIGHT ON LORD.
---
&gt; The meta right now is balanced to 3 classes (Firebrand, Scourge, Herald/Renegade).
---
Yep, as someone with all classes, I'd love to try some other out without being dead weight.
---
Power Herald, Trapper DH, Support/Bruiser Scrapper and Power DD are seen often in pvp. 
---
Yu could still run Core Burn Guard, Core Warrior GS Axe/SH, Core shatter mesmer, Core Ranger and Freshair Ele though. 
---
I never said you can’t use it in enemy territory, read more carefully and don’t be so salty
---
4 overloads a day XD seems fair
---
I kinda like the plain one too, goes well with tea or coffee. 
---
Sugar coated ones taste too sweet if taken with tea or coffee. 
---
Engineer currently is being carried by Holosmith almost exclusively, with some Scrapper builds people keep trying out with questionable results.
---
 The profession doesn't have even close to enough condition output to be a serious threat. Your only hope is to be matched vs revanent which is known to be weak vs condis or surprise people with extremely well-timed Moa from Elixir X toolbelt, with no support player around.
---
Man, I just wish they clean up Explosives and especially Firearms lines, coz atm they're huge mix of power-kit-condi traits.
---
Thanks for the edit info.  I was reading up on what a relink was and also noted that you can't earn WvW pips for 2 weeks after a transfer.  But it's unlikely that the mount will be a reward track so I don't think pips need to be considered.  It also doesn't say my reward track will be reset so that's good.  I'll try finding what home world mine is linked to when i get off work later.  Currently on Sanctum of Rall.
---
Yeah at one point people should stop posting about things they have no idea [about.So](https://about.So) please [OP.Read](https://OP.Read) what people already wrote in this thread and then think accordingly next time.
---
Yeah, knowing anet they'll probably put a big fat account bound time gate like "play WvW for an hour a day for seven days" on it.
---
&gt; interesting plays and tactics that we wouldn't want to give up now
---
Like gliding from fights or gliding into towers/keeps to defend to stay away from fights.
---
Yep, totally wouldn't want to give that up in a pvp game mode. /s
---
As long as she feels the price is too high, the expacs aren't that important anyway. If she gets a toon started that she loves and really gets into it, then it might suddenly not matter to her how much it costs. That being said, I got both expansions for about $30 USD when I returned to the game last spring from a longish break, the sales go in cycles. You can set alerts on some sites like [slickdeals.net](https://slickdeals.net) to notify you when "guild wars" shows up in a deal thread.
---
You're welcome - I've definitely noticed that a lot of the black dyes appear *way* too dark on legendary armour!
---
The squeaky wheel gets the oil. A lot of the people on the WvW forums are people who like to complain and have things their way (from what I’ve experienced).
---
I have not met a single person on two separate servers that wants mounts, and I’m in TS and discord with dozens of people most days. 
---
Nope, I can't wait.
---
I agree. But depending on how they're doing their research, or whether Poe's Law comes into it, there's no good and reliable way to measure that difference.
---
God damn skill injectors. Nothing has managed to piss me off as how complacent people were when...
---
...ugh, yeah. Nevermind. Not the right place.
---
They should remove being able to glide in combat other than that I like it. Rank 1600 as roamer so no pvd.
---
The world is against you.
---
Dual focus Mesmer just because of how cool it would look.
---
Or duel warhorn on anything: *Can't do any damage, but can call for help.*
---
Ayyyy, you're following OP''s guide already. Great work. Don't forget to mention some minor inconvenience and equate it to the developers completely failing the game.
---
Roaming is already a playstyle that works poorly. Since there are several oneshot out of stealth builds running around (Thief and Mesmer), that is what roaming generally devolves into. Add to that that every time you get oneshot without even being given time to react, you have to walk minutes just to get oneshot again, as well as the fact that you will spend more time walking than actually fighting most of the time, and its easy to see why WvW is so unpopular. Most likely, this will help those players who are interested in WvW but dont play it due to running back taking too long, and likely cause them to play WvW. 
---
Also server loads is almost entirely because of the way GW2 handles damage, rather than player models. Every time any stat changes, it has to recalculate, even if its in the middle of an attack. That causes massive serverloads.
---
Give the *Social Awkwardness* fractal instability to WvW! ^^jk ^^^and ^^^the ^^^birds ^^^too
---
I mean, I’m interested in trying out wvw so I’m working on some celestial gear, but my god are the timegates horrible - 5 days for 1 insignia??. I guess I could level a revenant which I have 0 interest in just because I can buy exotics for it and go berserker? It’s just bizarre and wvw info seems so sparse on what new players can actually do. 
---
&gt; spends time making a meme
---
&gt; doesn't even do a simple spelling check
---
I loved that update because it brought new upgrades for objectives and it eliminated the cost of upgrades for the poor mugs who paid for them with zergs that rarely defended. Some of the greatest burn out I saw in WvW was from the dedicated people who spent their own silver to upgrade camps, towers and keeps only for the zerg on the map (often a fight guild) fail to respond to call outs to defend that structure from an attacking force.
---
This also resulted in a snowball effect where paying for upgrades often had very low returns for losing servers because all that money was lost the moment the stronger server rolled over you. This resulted in weaker servers becoming weaker because they often didn't bother to pay the upgrade, and stronger servers got stronger because their structures were permanently upgraded. The weaker server was like a gazelle with a broken foot - any time someone wanted to flip a tower or keep they would choose the paper corner because it was a free cap. The playing field is a little more even with automatic upgrades, even 3rd place servers often get upgraded structures now.
---
The 'strategy' of the old system was also only decided by a single person (so it doesn't really fit the game mode as a server shared structure, losing it is a loss for the tiniest minority of players anyway) and most of the time you went the exact same build order anyway.
---
I don't see how the changes to structure upgrades and tactivators are out of touch with WvW. They are a dramatic improvement for a lot of people.
---
The raid community is not toxic.
---
Because they don't add anything to the game mode, and will likely detract from it.
---
If you invest a good amount of time into WvW, this becomes obvious. A WvW mount is only there for gem sales, not to improve the game mode.
---
&gt; A mount isn't going to entice new players.
---
Except it will. Every time there's an event, or double exp, people "dip into wvw" for the week to mess around. It's almost a known quantity for guilds at this point; a few dozen to a hundred new players, reducing match quality, but with a narrow window to prove the mode is worth their time. Enterprising guild leaders can and will recruit as hard as possible, put on their shiny pugmanding faces, and make the sales pitch. It will *not* convert enough players to 'save' the mode, but it will get some.
---
&gt; improving WvW into something everyone wants to hop into
---
I feel compelled to make the counterargument that WvW **is still** a PvP gamemode, and that's never going to have universal appeal. Yes it should be improved, yes there are huge problems, but ever expecting or even desiring that a "significant portion" of the playerbase should want to be in it feels shortsighted.
---
Anet had a way to guarantee a huge portion of players went in; WvW used to be part of world exploration, to make legendaries. Why did they take that away? Complaints, probably. Justified ones, from a lot of folks.
---
And what makes you think I'm an OWP or have never  played PvP or WvW? And its been just over a year since they announced [Alliances](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/26547/world-restructuring/p1) 
---
I personally thought it would've happened by now but I guess they bit off more than they can chew and its gonna take longer to digest.
---
I have a home instance I hit every day, and I've built up 1k+ blood rubys from that, I'm aware of bloodstone fen.  But bloodstone fen's rings are unique, there are no accessories, and harriers isn't an option (which up until recently was the only way to get more boon duration without adding toughness).  Fortunately for some reason, diviners was retroactively added to blood ruby trinkets, even though harriers/grieving wasn't.  Its still a pain in the ass to regear chrono every month.  
---
Sanctum of Rall have a [website](https://www.sanctumofrall.com/), which has a link in the top bar to a discord channel that appears to be active, so you could probably ask about WvW there. Good luck!
---
Great guide OP. You forgot that it's very important to bring up how the developers are failing in any post you can. 
---
Is someone asking about how to get started in WvW? Post that they shouldn't even bother because WvW sucks and the developers are idiots. 
---
Is someone asking how to get started with the game or whether they should purchase? Tell them that the whole game is a mess, that it's dying, and that the people in charge are mindless monkeys with no concept of how to make a game.
---
Basically, the more negativity you can bring to every single post you see, the better!
---
I consider the rollerbeetle content and PvE gets a lot of things added.
---
&gt; People hated on gliding when it was introduced into wvw
---
Still do. Gliding has unfixed exploits, decreases the penalty for dying in certain towers, and allows people to flat out avoid fighting in a pvp game mode.
---
Hey! 
---
I agree celestial is a pain in the fucking ass. What class are you looking to gear? (Scourge?) Because right now you don't really need celestial for any WvW builds. (It can be used, but it's not the only option for any class). 
---
On scourge you can go for power builds (mix marauder / zerk / cavalier which is cheap and easily obtainable). You stil go heavy on corrupts, but don't really need condi damage.
---
Don't forget to pretend that this isn't one of the most succesful MMOs in the west, with a truly massive amount of active players. This game clearly has only 1000 or so active players *at most*, and only ten of them play WvW exclusively. So surely Arenanet have no clue what they are doing.
---
Yes. But will it be a nerf to onehit Soulbeast? Perma stealth? Will gliders be finally fixed? I guess no, because Anet pushes stuff while others are still bugged.
---
yeah, as you said, the amount of damage the cat can do to the door will matter. 
---
PvP player:
---
*Grabs Popcorn* 
---
*Excited for next WvW dev stream*
---
Well you clearly haven't played the matchups we've played, where by simply getting IN RANGE to RENDER the enemy characters it would start causing skill lag and people porting around everywhere, we've had 3 matchus as ros vs wsr vs kodash where all 3 servers wanted to fight but everytime 1 of the 3 had to sit at about 3k range away not to cause any lag, couldn't even hit a gate if you'd wonder.
---
No, they haven't improved server performance because it's still a shitfest, this was happening last week. 
---
Their argument for 1000 is about the same as yours of “truly massive.” Neither is back by any number. As far as you know the games population could be on part with SWOTR. 
---
They hadn't, I was making an assumption based on them wanting to maximise mount skin selling...
---
That's true - it's technically that you have to be on a server for one full week before you can get pips, so if you were to transfer right before resets on Friday (not necessarily relinks, every Friday at 9 EST the matches will reset, and the losers will move down a bracket and the winners up one. Relinks happens on the last friday of every 2nd month's reset.) you only really don't have pips for 1 week.  Since you're currently on SoR it'd be worth checking out the server's website at [https://www.sanctumofrall.com](https://www.sanctumofrall.com) or hop onto their discord at [https://discord.gg/WfnGuBb](https://discord.gg/WfnGuBb).  Their discord is only for people on SoR, so you'll have to verify by using an API key.  The discord has a link to some builds that are good for running with a pug group (as in, not an organized guild group), along with places you can ask questions / talk with people on your sever, and voice coms for when commanders are leading raids.

How to get insta karma on this reddit. 
---
1) Blind praise everything anet does.  
---
2) Shit on anyone who has an amount of reason to complain. 
---
3) Pick a favorite quaggas color.

4) Post a picture of your legendary with a flip phone. 
---
I didn't, what's it about?
---
Besides constant practice, don’t sell yourself short on group comp. Difficult encounters in fractals become a lot easier when your group has solid support in terms of heals and boons/buffs that increase your offensive capabilities (might fury quickness alacrity &amp; banners). Do not join/stay in groups that fail to have this, with maybe the exception of no alacrity due to a quickbrand healer with no renegade. 
---
Additionally, the faster things die the easier the encounter, so make sure you know your rotation by heart and that the people with you are at least on decent power dps classes (weaver, DH, pSoulbeast are top tier. Engi, dd, reaper are slightly less meta but are still fine to have). Seeing a scourge, berserker warrior, or condi mirage is a sign that the group may have some inexperience and fractal run will be slow/full of wipes. 
---
Finally, make sure you have the easy to obtain items to be a better asset. Mostly all the fractal pots - more damage, more damage resistance, and more dodges (though at high level thief play you probably don’t want more endurance). Always run the best dps food/utl you can afford and note that on several of the fractals you can run utility consumables that makes you do 10% more damage to x mobs and take 10% less damage from those mobs. Really good on 99cm, Mai trin, etc. just be ready to change utility consumables 1-3 times per fractal run. 
---
Hope this helps! Any questions let me know
---
It's a garbage gamemode that'll eventually ruin you mentally. Fuck the balance team and fuck this game, quit while you still have some fond memories.
---
This is what is exciting me, the decreases travel time will surely shake up the tactics used by everyone. And surely after years of the same tactics a shake up will be good fun? Theres a reason all the battle royale and mobas implement big gameplay changes... to make different seasons feel different. 
---
Check out the [wardrobe analyser](https://immortius.net.au/wardrobe-unlock-analyser/) if you're unsure :)
---
Both. I don't raid for the same reason.
---
Shape shifting with illusions. Basically you cast glamours on yourself like when kasmeer disguises you at the end of pof and your shatter skills are replaced with forms that you can glamour into. The more illusions you shatter, the longer you can maintain the transformation, each form changes your skills so you'd have an aoe form, a CC form, a single target form or something along those lines. Would allow use of daggers. 
---
Because if there isn't a delay, why change the season in the first place other than theatrics then? Why not have a single 12 episode season instead of splitting it half.
---
Kettle meet pot holy shit.
---
Based upon his history, I'm going with serious.
---
War would be "guerre", so "Griffe de guerre" is the translation for Warclaw(literally: claw of war).
---
I agree. the community backlash is really hurtful to the WvW devs.
---
All two of them.
---
Which WvW developers ? OmegaLUL
---
I had already created my account years back on SoR so I don’t know much about wvw servers but I’m stuck there. I’d appreciate a link to a power build since the metabattle one says staff/axe/focus and the celestial one scepter/sword (caladbolg can be made into a scepter, Warpblade was going to be the sword) and axe/torch. 
---
Nono this is GW2, meta only ever refers to timed events on a given map. WvW's problem is its meta is weekly instead of every 2 hours, you can't farm it enough!
---
Good points. Of course, talking a camp isn't always a case to bring a zerg at you. Sometimes, a small roaming group may try to cap a tower. Sometimes, while you are fighting a group, a zerg appears out of nowhere. The reason I made this suggestion, is because zergs have strength in numbers; maybe they should give smaller groups a small boost in speed. In my head it works, but I can't be sure if it isn't tested in game :)
---
nah piken has commanders still
---
everything has to be like gandara, clowns everywhere that have no clue how to teamplay, feed themselves into saving garri lord for 3 hours and then go on forum proud of how they got killed for 3 hours straight but won with acs.
---
\^ not a joke they seriously did that
---
Let’s play test mounts in eotm 
---
All you took from that was running fast and damage? You do understand the cc from the engages is more silly than the damage. I'm sorry for actually wanting to play the game and not cheesing my way through stuff like defiance bars with 1 skill that everyone has access to.
---
And yeah running fast is completely fine. Kill 5 people, wait 10 seconds and those 5 people are back on tag like nothing happened. No issue there.
---
the code is the game key you used for the account, if you still have access to the email you registered with you should have this from when they originally emailed you your key.
---
But it's not about what's best for the WvW players, it's about what brings in more people for a healthier population. Can't do that with just balance and opimization. 
---
So I'd say people who don't WvW have as valid of a claim as anyone else.
---
Those are the same players that had to have the story instance nerfed to instantly revive you if you die because it was too hard. =)
---
I've always wondered why Anet continued to communicate with the community on here in any way. Everytime anything was announced that wasn't exactly what people wanted it was shat on. It must kill the excitement for the devs so much. 
---
The silence we have gotten from devs the last few month's has been caused by this communities toxic bs. They're the devs for a reason, they only have so much resources to work with, and they have to prioritise that. In a perfect world im sure they would love to have a team dedicated to each and every aspect of the game but that isn't plausible.
---
The devs can only do their best.
---
Boon chrono is still strong and power chrono is busted op. Shut the fuck up with you chrono pity party. Mesmer is meta in every gamemode and people still cry tears of salt for it being underpowered. All wvw players want mounts except for vocal minority that are the veterans because of whom wvw is the state it is in. Your old and boring mindset is against anything with speed and excitement which new players wanted. Honestly wvw is so booring that i would rather quit the game altogether than only play wvw like some of the veterans.
---
That's what I meant. LOL!
---
Trapper DH? I see core guards and firebrands more often. I think dh isn't in a great place right now. I mean it can be effective, but not as much as other professions/builds.
---
Would be cool if the token of affection they she gives us in the egg chamber after we help teach her about compassion and stuff was her phylactery
---
Ah, I wasn't sure. Thanks for clarifying.
---
How dare you say this! You're clearly not a "real" WvW player! I bet you've dishonored your GvG guild by doing Istan farm that one weekend when you wanted more gold to buy a second ascended set for your WvW infusions. You disgust me.
---
Thank you! How did you get it the 2nd time? Did you end up looking at the wiki? What other parts did you end up doing? I just ended up killing things to gain lvl exp.
---
I'm sorry, but if I'm on fire and also have a headache, I'm not going to take Tylenol first. Yes, more people would be great, but only when:
---
A. The servers can actually handle it (they can't even handle the current population).
---
B. The game is actually fun to play on any class and those classes contribute something. There will always be a meta, but it should be fluid and anyone should be able to reasonably contribute with any class. 
---
The problem is mounts solve neither of those problems and will most likely actually exacerbate the lag. Also, to claim PvE people who have never touched the game mode have as much claim to give their input as the players keeping the mode alive is just laughable.
---
But krakato-blah-blah is more characters
---
I feel as though I've just walked into a room and been confronted by the sight of pie debris scattered around an Eiffel tower of chairs, the corpse of a man in a clown wig and make-up hanging from the curtains, and the back end of lawn flamingo that's been rammed halfway through the wall plaster beside the word "CONSEQUENCES". 
---
Any vague idea about when the next Path of Fire expansion discount will be? Kinda sad to pick the game up again recently and noticing the expansion was discounted 3 months ago, feels like I'd throw away 15€ if I bought it now at full price.
---
Better than being surrounded by selfish children who think bullshit like "I paid money for this game so I can play it how I want!"
---
Except there is no reason here. Wvw is almost dead because of toxic players in it who dont know what they want. Even if anet gives them something after a long time, they hate on it. I dont understand how stupid people can be. Anything, literally anything is better than nothing for wvw rn.
---
We are transforming anet in the next Blizzard. 
---
Is it possible to locate stats for the active player base for this game?
---
At most, another engage option for PvE. Lasso an enemy to pull them to you as you dismount.
---
You are a brave soul. I do not envy the amount of misplaced rage you will receive for posting this thoughtful critique. If my time on Reddit has taught me anything, it is that you will almost certainly fail to reach those who need this message most. I hope it was cathartic to create at the very least.  
---
Your post is the opposite of the person you're responding to. He's arguing that the mount will help roaming, you're arguing that the mount will kill roaming. That's how hysterical the criticism is.
---
Sale or not. It’s one of few games that is just worth it ^^
---
But do keep a look for sales on GW2 main page also they have links to known distributors ^^
---
Here's the thing: one fuckwit with suboptimal gear means one less player who can actually pull their fucking weight. When we tell you to get properly specced, it's because your useless ass is a net negative and your seat could be better filled by someone who can be fucked to spec into the right prefixes.
---
1. You don't need to pay to enter WvW.
---
2. Giving poeple shit for minding their own business is a very bad policy.
---
I even lag while trying to mount in those 20-person mount races in Divinity's Reach. Sometimes, when I try to mount my character will be phased into the ground and stuck until the mount itself loads. In stuff like Istan farm it sometimes becomes quicker to just walk. I can't imagine how bad it'll be if trying to run with a zerg or even look in SMC's direction during prime time.
---
Ok, here is how I see this. many in WvW want the core aspects of it balanced and improved. I do as well.
---
However, that will not happen until there is a need to transfer staffing resources to it which won't happen unless it makes money.
---
Now we have a mount specificcally gotten in WvW that skins can be made for. The knock on effect being that more staff will be allocated to improving WvW once its profitable to do so. My two cents, such as it is.
---
no just pinata, gerent, shaterer, and auric basin. 
---
* nerfed necromancer Wells by 20%
---
Imagine golding a post that not only insults other players, but is such poor satire it has to include the word in the title.
---
Seriously, the people doing that stream are true heroes, willing to put up with the inevitable abuse to demonstrate and give some attention to the game mode.  People need to dial it back from all the hysteria and screaming.  Save it for actual wvw play. 
---
Inquest Bracers [(the gloves on this set)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/4/45/Inquest_armor_%28medium%29_human_female_front.jpg).
---
Oh,  we victims of our assumptions when the world turns out differently than we thought it would. 
---
it's not that hardcorewvwer have no reasons to complain, they have a lot for sure... but, if i try to figure out how anet can resolve them based on the constructive idea those whiners provide, i can only imagine a flat land, not even too big, with no structures, no npc and just the right number of carefully selected players that must pass an abilitation test and on a strict time schedule...
---
I'm excited
---
I’m not denying that some WvWers act like what OP said, but this massive circle jerk that wvw players should just shut the fuck up is getting really old really fast.
---
I do wonder if it will be just that. Pressing your mount hotkey and mounting up. If that would be the case then the servers would be on fire few minutes into the patch.
---
I will actually go pistol/shield sometimes while running SD Holo for some added protection due to the loss of some roll energy. Or also sometimes when running Protection Holo instead of sword for fun.
---
However, the reality of it is that the main hand pistol is just a poor weapon in general. 1 barely does any damage, 2 is incredibly slow and breaks from anything, and 3 is just meh.
---
Adding to that is that the only way to play core engineer is basically glass cannon due to lacking the natural stab/heals/damage/cleanse from Holo and you've got a subpar build in the making. 
---
That's because Anet doesn't provide rewards-based incentives to encourage replaying maps.  Of course it feels like there's nothing to do in this game when anywhere I go the only thing I can do is make gold to buy mats or get mats and sell the excess for gold.  Anet doesn't like gear treadmills, that's cool I don't like them either.  But a gear treadmill serves a critical purpose and if you aren't going to design a game with one then yoy need to find a meaningful replacement or yeah, you end up with people who come back every update for 3 days and then peace again once they've played the story and done the map meta a few times.
---
but they still don't hide poll results 
---
As much as gliding does with non-HoT players.
---
You must also think only rich people's lives matter. Because thats what you are saying here.
---
Oh , now that's useful. I'll try that out. Thanks.
---
I'll concede that. 
---
I'll still say that while it is doable (really, this is code, technically *anything* is "doable"), it doesn't mean it's the highest priority or even easy. I'm prepping for work now that to another programmer probably sounds simple, but due to the nature of the history of this application, it's actually a very difficult and tricky feature to update/change. Which is all I'm saying, without knowing the code, we can't possibly know how "easy" or "simple" something really is. That doesn't mean something should/shouldn't be worked on, just that the "it'd be so simple" argument is flawed...... even when coming from those of us that work in any sort of Development/Technical role.
---
You're also still leaving out that there are business priorities as well. Those will be focused on growth and revenue. I can't speak for ANet, but in our case, all of our work goes into focusing on growth... sometimes that means improving margins, reliability, or fixing bugs. Sometimes it's adding new features. But we also operate on monthly/yearly subs and contracts, no such sort of on-going revenue exists for ANet, so they are forced to focus on the BL store at all times.
---
Gliding is convenient but doesn’t make or break wvw imo. Mounts would change a lot potentially. 
---
Haha , I already said up top I'm using the enrichment.
---
Nope. have you?
---
nothing of what you just bothered to type out is relevant in regards to my reply. if you paid any amount attention, you'd realize that generally the feedback from people that identify as "wvw players" is quite reasonable, if a bit fueled by years-old frustration. those stirring the drama pot on the other hand are generally people that want to ride the memey blame train of "WvWers being impossible to satisfy, and they should just be grateful for whatever they get" with utter disregard towards the past 7 years. i wish you good fun on your further adventures of deflection and ignorance on this matter, fare well.
---
&gt;Ill join your server, get a tag and open for everyone and lose every keep, tower and fight again and again with casual players. 
---
Please do this. 
---
&gt; Wtf will you do tell me. 
---
Tag up on another map and be happy you're taking care of the queue's for me by wiping repeatedly? 
---
It's not a secret that the only people still playing Runescape are the diehard fans, the on-and-offers, and a slow filter of curious newbies, so there's no reason to conceal that information.
---
It actually works in the interesting way on this subreddit. For the first hour or so every  controversial thread floats in the uncertainty, until it establishes a circlejerk around one or two most provocative comments and after that it takes a heavy dive into the direction of that opinion. Regardless of the matter, really. 
---
This thread has a chance to go down in flames too but "how to crush..." post was successfully fought off. But it doesn't prevent another, 100% similar, but differently polarized thread to emerge at any time and have a lot of upvoted "critical" comments.
---
No, WvW players should be happy with the PvE scraps it gets tossed every few years. You already had your content piece 3~4 years ago when they released desert borderland and you SHOULD be happy they are giving you these mounts as pity. Excuse me while i go back to the real mode where i can enjoy actual content every 3 months.
---
So, would I be correct to assume you've never glided into a tower, where your opponent was already inside fighting the Lord.... for the fight?  Cause by limiting yourself to walking or running to that fight, you'd miss it,  AND, have your Commander wondering why you're not there to help win it that fight.  Those two sides to every coin perspectives, ornery stuff that. 
---
So... put mounts in with player model limit, so that we can turn that shit off and enjoy the game with our eyes intact?
---
This is why i browse reddit.
---
WHERES THE DAMN AUTH DELAY
---
i am unsure as to if the mount will be gated behind a PoF purchase. Gliding is an example as to why it could be. Being able to "rent" a mount in PvE would speak against it.
---
&gt; So, would I be correct to assume you've never glided into a tower
---
Of course I have, say NET for example.
---
&gt; Cause by limiting yourself to walking or running to that fight, you'd miss it, AND, have your Commander wondering why you're not there to help win it - that fight.
---
You mean in a game mode where part of the game is response time, you might not make it because you can't respond fast enough?
---
That's kind of the point I'm making. Mounts reduces response time even further -- and defenders *already* have a significant advantage over attackers.
---
Lol wtf is this shitty elitism in this fuckin casual game. Get a better game and be elitist in that if you can. Ill join your server, get a tag and open for everyone and lose every keep, tower and fight again and again with casual players. Wtf can you do? I have paid for the game same as you and you are not any more important than a new player who installed gw2 on a f2p account. Its better that you understand it fast. Lol no wonder wvw is dead because it resides people like you. Maybe anet shouldnt have given mount and left the gamemode alone because wvw'ers are rotting wvw from inside anyway.

Well done, you have followed steps 1,2, and 3 to the letter

Almost a coherent sentence. Almost.

There's no bill at the end of your meal here, so it just doesn't hold up. There is no restaurant that up front says they won't bill you, even if they accept tips if the customer feels like it.

It's good to see people downvoting my post when it clearly makes sense. If you can't beat them, downvote them, right?
---
Hey! Just a piece of advice, have an "abstract" such as the ones journals have, where they give you a tl;dr that actually tells you what the post is about, all you did in the tl;dr was repeat the tittle with more words, without saying what the problem was and how mounts as a symptom of it.
---
I partly read the post but I was disagree with mounts not being a proper "solution" of sorts. I can only speak from personal experience from my friends and I who have played WvW a lot during tournaments but not a whole lot outside of that; mobility **SUCKS** big time, specially when you are few people roaming. Mounts are a nice addition and bound to bring people, which does help with population, catching up with groups, and small group roaming (as well as escaping those damn perma-stealth thieves camping you and disengaging once you corner them, only to do the same time and time without you being able to outrun/see them)
---
The game doest need to cater to commanders, commander can only lead if there are people there in the first place, so  the incentive should be for the non-commanders, the commander's job is to guide people and make best use of the resources available to achieve a goal.
---
I’m looking forward to trying it out, I don’t expect it to save WvW or anything since that is a whole other beast and this is a bandaid.
---
The two most demanded things for WvW in my experience are game balance and population imbalances.
---
Game balance is a never ending quest for game balance, especially when new elite specs come out, and fortunately for those people there is a balance patch literally next week.
---
Population balance isn't an easy fix (and ArenaNet have attempted multiple different bandaid fixes to population including, but not limited to, the server pairing system. Right now the biggest change to a major system of the game since launch is taking place exclusively to cater to WvW players and solve this problem. It's a huge problem that requires a lot of work to fix but ArenaNet are actively committed to finding the best solution they can in the form of the alliance system.
---
Neither of those things are made by the mount design team - the people who design and implement mounts are their own team, they aren't the people who tweak the numbers on scourge shrouds, they aren't the people who code the way the new system will match players of diverse hours, guilds and WvW activity to make the best balanced match ups they can make. They are the people who made the raptor, jackal, griffon, rollerbeetle etc. People who previously made PvE exclusive content were assigned to make something nice for WvW people in addition to the other things in the works for WvW people (future balance patches, future elite specs, the upcoming alliance system). In repsonse to being given something from a team that previously made PvE exclusive stuff (and thus didn't disrupt the active development of the things WvW players specifically want)  the vocal WvW players shit all over the gift from the mounts team.
---
This isn't a case of instead, it's a case of in addition to. Big problems require big fixes, balance is an ongoing challenge that doesn't stop until active development on the game stops. The hysteria about this mount and the reaction to it is unjustified, unreasonable and absurd.
---
In-game in open world PvE the community is great. In-game PvP/WvW/Fractal/Raids can be anywhere between great to complete shit. Official forums are over moderated shit. Unofficial forums/reddit are good to shit.
---
You seem mad
---
Personally I purchased the deluxe versions of everything.
---
The gems are a nice to have, and can really improve your enjoyment of the game. They offer a lot of QoL improvements, that I think make it worth the investment. The deluxe versions give gems at a bit of a discount when you take into consideration the cost of the base expansion.
---
Gems can purchase a lot of things, like lounge passes, unbreakable tools, bag/bank expansions, and even directly convert to gold. So even if you arent interested in any of the QoL stuff you can get a direct head start on your character. You'll also likely want to take into consideration any Living Story episodes you missed, as in order to get access to them you need to unlock them with gems.
---
The PoF deluxe version, in particular the lounge pass, is pretty sweet. I have a mystlock pass so don't use the Lilly one often, but my wife uses the Lilly pass all the time. It's essentially "virtually everything" all in one convenient place. Even if you don't include it's convenient location at the very beginning of the PoF content, I'd say it's worth it. Most perma passes cost about 1200 gems with is \~$15 USD, if you want to think of it that way. That said, I hate the layout of Lilly vs Mystlock...
---
I've been asking for WvW mounts since PoF came out. I wanted a dolyak but an armored tiger is pretty cool too.
---
Same.  I main necromancer, but decided I wanted to grind out a Gift if Battle.  Walking everywhere sucked so hard.  I ended up using my soulbeast ranger with a bird pet so I could get steady swiftness uptime.  
---
I don't like all the whining from either side. And frankly, PvE players constantly antagonizing the WvW players over something they're already upset about is a lot more idiotic in my eyes.  
---
How about everyone just shut the fuck up about this and wait until it's fully released before we make judgement. And to all the PvE players telling WvW players they know what's best for it, I'll keep that in mind next time there's something you're all unhappy with so I can make a thread about how ungrateful you all are and how much I, as a WvW player that PvE's for a few hours once every couple months, think this new thing is wonderful.
---
no, I want a leap, the engage skill to dismount enemy immediately. Like your freaking tiger jumps and pulls down enemy from the seat of his mount kind fantasy. It's a skillshot that you can miss ofc, and it dismounts you to, doesn;t matter if you hit or missed the target.
---

Mounts are made by the mount team. The problems frequently cited with WvW aren't going to be solved by the mount team (and are under active development anyway). In the mean time, here's this cool thing the mount team made for you.
---
Norn are basically glory hounds, Asura are smart-asses, and humans are more generic than buttered toast. Charr are definitely the most fleshed out in their aesthetic
---
Hey, I raid in gw2 at a high level and a long time ago was a top 50 US raider in WoW as well, so my perspective might be welcome.
---
Raids in both games have some similarities but are ultimately very different beasts. The difficulty curve in guild wars is all over the place, with the most difficult boss in the game (Dhuum Challenge Mote) being about as difficult as an end-of-tier boss in heroic difficulty back when that was the upper limit. However, the bulk of the fights are really easy to beat if your goal is to just kill it at all costs. 
---
Additionally, unlike WoW, there aren't really any difficulty tiers to raids like you'd see with LFG-Normal-Heroic-Mythic. There are challenge motes, which introduces a new mechanic to the fight in exchange for a one-time reward and a couple titles, but only 9ish bosses have that available, and not all of them are actually more difficult than the normal version of the encounter.
---
The challenge in this game does not come from the encounters themselves, but from self imposed goals from the team. At a more casual level, that goal may be to complete a weekly full clear of every boss in under 3 hours. At a higher level that goal may be to obtain a patch record for the encounter.
---
Some other notes: The lines of the holy trinity are blurred in this game. There are healers, there are tank roles for most bosses, and of course there are dps, but there's also a lot of overlap. The meta healer for raids (Druid) is actually the worst non-meme throughput healer, but they provide some crucial buffs to the dps classes and more healing is not needed. The tank role is also a bit different, since surviving as the tank is not difficult and there's no threat mechanic.
---
As far as getting into raids is concerned, gw2 makes it incredibly easy. The gear grind is much more mild than in WoW, and you can be ready to raid with most classes by buying exotic quality gear for pretty cheap off the trading post (auction house). However, you won't be able to pug with no experience and training runs on the lfg aren't too common on NA. So if you want to get started, the best way to do that is to join a discord training server such as Raiders in Training, Guild Wars 2 Raid Academy, or a guild that's willing to train you.
---
The massive circle jerk about wvw players shutting up is no bigger than the massive circle jerk from wvw players who are tantruming like children, so don't pretend like the second thing doesn't exist. The first developed in response to the second, and both are pretty tiring already.
---
I'm a casual WvWer, myself, and I acknowledge that the lack of attention to the gamemode bothers me much less than the hardcores because when I get annoyed I can always faff off to do something else. I also acknowledge that WvWers have some legit grievances here, and are well within their rights to voice their concerns. However, I am thoroughly sick of *all* types of players who have been turning up the doom and gloom over the past month or so. Saying things like "the devs don't care at all" or "this game is dead/dying" does absolutely *zero* good for anyone, and can in fact actually hurt the game that most of us still love. The more the playerbase says these things, the more the negativity spreads, and the more the negativity spreads, the more people will quit and the more potential newbies will be scared away from even trying it. I won't deny that there are issues that need to be addressed, but I do not want this game's end hastened in any form or fashion.
---
I would just like to see complaints tackled in a more mature manner than a lot of people seem to be capable of right now. There have been some really good, constructive posts. But there's also far too much childish whining that gives others the impression that some of these people woke up cranky from a nap and can't be pleased by anything as a result. 
---
That's an inherited gameflaw made by anet because they didn't consider that. If they'd balance their classes in wvw the problem would disappear.
---
If you have the wrong class, you are useless. Simple as that.
---
No "but I don't have anything else" no "I wanna play that way" will change that.
---
Complain to anet for their shit balance.
---
Oh wait the WvW community did that for years. We got a mount for that.
---
Oh god, the bum flaps (especially on charr) make me so sad!!
---
Yeah I can understand frustration with Anet, but stuff like this just turns people away from wanting to try the game mode.
---
He's quite the master.
---
When I see someone else using them, I give them an affirming head nod IRL 😂
---
Didn't they say something along the lines of "the story of the gods is not yet finished" when specifically asked about Menzies?
---
Consider DLGamer, an authorised online retailer. Their discount isn’t as high as ANet’s, but their sales are way more frequent.
---
What i meant was that while English and French are not agglutinative languages either, in a fantasy setting one would often find made-up words constructed in this manner. No idea who/what started it though.
---
Comments like this are just ignorant. More than two people contribute to WvW. Game balance is something which impacts on WvW in a major way, are those people not WvW devs? The mounts team that made the warclaw previously worked on the other mounts like the rollerbeatle, are the people who made the WvW mount WvW devs? If not, what kind of dev are they?
---
The skills requires to create the alliance server system would involve all kinds of people from across the company over a long period of time, are they counted in the "two WvW devs"? Or is it possible that an efficiently running MMO development team moves people around for different projects when they are needed and the number of people contribute to a specific game mode fluctuates based on what's in the pipeline?
---
he's not wrong though, there's a time and a place for defending Anet, but the general WvW playerbase's reaction is pretty much right, _especially_ in regards to Point 4. (and I mean actual WvW players, who _mainly_ play WvW).
---
we've been constantly trying to communicate (constructively, for the most part) with them for ___6 years___. we don't expect much, but at least a dialogue outside of twitch chat would be appreciated. at least we'd know someone is listening. 
---
Well yeah, but I couldn't be bothered to type that kind of response on my phone. Buzzwords like "toxic casual" and "whiteknighting" came to mind but that would be to much of a generalization again as well.
---
I mean the entire frontpage was basically a cesspool of counter jerking, defending the addition of a mount to a game mode none of the karma farmers probably every really played or understood.
---
Feels like the "counter jerk" was much bigger than the original one. Reminds me of the refugee situation and lefties living in their dream world. Rationality and long term thinking are unwelcome on reddit anyway.
---
Rinse out the WvW community with bleach water and start over again.
---
They’ve stated several times on the forums and discord for dev communication that, that is how things work for WvW. 
---
Regardless the largest issue is lack and care of lack for balance changes in the game mode and lack of seemingly being unable to understand how their changes affect WvW. I could care less about the mount but it’s silly to leave a broken skill or trait for 3-6 months. A year and a half in some cases before addressing it. Especially with skill and trait splitting being a thing now.
---
People would be fine in WvW if the meta shake ups weren’t due to other game mode balance changes most of the time. 
---
thanks for info m8 i will try out power necro since balance patch comes next week maybe something interstead will come out.
---
Were not allowed to complain now? Its so funny to me because I've seen so much antagonism from primarily PvE players on here, yet there's a post on here about the fact that they won't nerf Mirage and its 100% supported. God forbid the people who play the game mode make their feelings felt about something that wasn't asked for and will most likely have a large impact on the game mode we primarily play.
---
Hey you, stop with your competing opinion with experience in specific modes. How dare you contradict the WvW hivemind?!?
---
In seriousness though, keep in mind that most of the people who are voicing their hate on this change seem to be gatekeeping anyone with a differing opinion in any way they can.
---
"You like this change? You must only play WvW casually."
---
"You play WvW a lot? Must not be your main game mode."
---
"You play WvW as your main game mode? You must suck then so we don't need to listen to you."
---
There are 3 trait lines to be filled for everyone. You will have access to 5 trait lines to choose 3 from and they will have +1 trait lines for each expansion they own. It does not mean you are at disadvantage because at a time only 3 trait lines are active for all. If you choose correct class you can delete other people who chose the fancy 3rd trait line instead of normal ones. There are such builds in gw2 that do not need expansion trait lines to be overpowered and dominant.
---
Kinda sad that Anet didnt asked their custumors, those who call themselves "wvw players" and also those who just go there from time to time or were thinking about it what they actually want, what they think they'd need - thanks to stuff like api-keys Anet could have gotten most of the infos they'd need for that easily anyway
---
Luxons out.
---
I love this skin, i also loved the whispers secret rifle. Not as realistic, but so sleek looking. I even still use the staff. Great set of weapons!
---
Lmao
---
You have a point, but don't shit on the \[Satire\] in the title. That doesn't mean it's poor satire, it just means that OP understands that not everyone easily picks up on those things -- especially in text form, and on the internet where anything that anyone might say *could* be a legitimately-held opinion that's absolutely serious. That's why people include /s when they're being sarcastic, too -- not necessarily because the sarcasm isn't good, but because you can't ever really be sure in a medium where people say legitimately crazy, ridiculous things *all the damn time*. 
---
At the very least, I think having every post tagged is appealing in terms of organization. I would have tagged it too, if it were my post, for that reason alone.
---
You're being downvoted because you nitpicked an irrelevant detail in his analogy and acted like it invalidated everything else he said. It doesn't matter if the analogy isn't perfect, you get the point he's trying to convey.
---
yh Ele was rocking when i used to play Staff for PvE and D/D for PvP and with high enough skill you could deal with anything.anyway i wanted to wait and see if it worth it to buy the PoF coz i dont want to waste 30$ and nvr play it (like i did with FO76) o think i will try Power Necro and w8 for next week balance changes
---
French is a controlled language.
---
Contrary to languages like English, popular usage doesn't determine what is or isn't a word..  there's an official organisation in charge of declaring what constitutes the French language.
---
regional colloquialisms are just that. 
---
Name me one and i will sure jump into it coz most of the MMO out there atm are garbage
---
is it this bad?
---
Exactly, im not quick to judge but us in the WvW community are vocal and very constructive on what exactly we want. This was NOT something we said we wanted lol.
---
His post history agrees.
---
Yo smartypants, if you cannot say anything nice, don't say anything at all. Why blame me for the development of WvW. I've been at this game for 6 years. It's the same old thing and since the last few years, latency has gotten worst. FPS drop has gotten bad.
---
Don't come and tell me your problems about getting ganked. The idea of playing WvW: be smart and tactical. No one asked you to run across the other side of the map, only to get buttraped. And no, no one said I was quitting + giving you my gold will get us both banned XD
---
I mean, PvP/WvW/Fractals/Raids are like 80% of the game.
---
This is clearly a post aimed at how over-exaggerated the communities reaction to any update that is proposed. Yes, devs can accept criticism and should be expected to, but the amount of posts in the past few days of "hurr durr Anet is terrible, game dead, everyone jump ship," has been silly. But this is the internet, and exaggeration and fake outrage is the name of the game
---
By looking at the way the dev we see in guildchats, let's play, etc... talk about the game, I can only feel the total opposite.
---
I think this actually proves my point. So thanks for that. 
---
To be frank, meta shakeups happen in all game modes because of all other game modes. ANets reluctance to split skills is the major factor there, and I kinda understand that reluctance.
---
When you split skills, you're increasing the workload on skill changes. You're also changing the way a character plays between game modes, and that's more than a little difficult to get a hold on as a player.
---
To be frank, the game is never going to be balanced. It's always going to take time and effort to re-balance, and the meta will always follow along to a specific set of skills that is "broken". Fixing those skills, on paper, is super easy. Just tweak that skill, right? Except you aren't just balancing that skill, you are balancing that class and even potentially that race. I get how easy it is for players to complain about balance, and the fact that things take a while to do, but I guarantee if you put 99% of players in charge of skill balance, you'd end up with a similarly broken balance. Likely worse. Because most of the users complaining see balance as "nerf that one skill and done".
---
Criticism comes from evaluation. People havent even tried mount yet and are complaining like the sky is falling.
---
is it a european game?
---
i've bought the box version of HoT on ebay, shipped today, hopefully works ok.  Going to play through that and consider PoF, maybe the Ultimate if still available.
---
Eyyy how dare someone give feedback, amirite?
---
$100 a player?!?
---
I havent spent that much in six years. 
---
&gt; "Coup de main" was used but has fallen out of favor
---
doubtful given that this means "a helping hand"
---
No. Only people that think the same are ignorant idiots.
---
You assume I complain becausd I don't care to respec or something. But I do respect for wvw. I do search for the current meta builds. I do care to pull my weight.
---
I'm just fed up with assholes that treat others like shit.
---
&gt; If you want a comparison google the content releases of final fantasy 14, as compared to guild wars 2.
---
Nitpick: FFXIV gets held up as a high standard of reliability because of the way they do their releases; all at once, nothing in between, with a highly metered rate of communication, and a very very specific schedule, and the nature of the content isn't completely comparable.
---
Anet absolutely could do this, *but* their communications strategy, and deployment strategy don't allow for it. If you look at the averages, release date numbers actually tend to be very similar to FFXIV, but because the updates are split out across a wider horizon, it seems much more diffuse.
---
* GW2 living story update average is 84 days between releases, fractals currently are ~200 days, raids ~300 days or so. Ignore festivals and balance, etc, it's not comparable to FFXIV's content here.
---
* FFXIV main scenario comes with major patches, and averages 100-112 days between releases. Dungeons come with those releases; 2 dungeons and a party/progression raid when tier changes every second patch, 1 dungeon and an alliance/non-progression raid on non-tier change patches.
---
So FFXIV's content volume is much higher on instanced content, but as a result not actually much faster, and the main scenario is actually significantly slower. GW2 also spends a lot more effort on environment, releasing maps with their story, whereas FFXIV is simply quests.
---
The bundling strategy SE uses for FFXIV would definitely make GW2 players much happier in terms of reliability, but it wouldn't speed things up appreciably, and that's important to recognize.
---
Last patch brought a super op support ren build that is very much used in fractals and a bit in raid + it has been top dick condi dps for a while now
---
Ever notice how every time there's a "controversy" threads like this pop up and get gilded and/or hundreds of upvotes in barely a few minutes?
---
Never understimate fanboys.

---
there you go 
---
can you explain to me how mounts give more lag to people?, from a server topology standpoint of course.
---
Maybe gathering runs across the maps? 
---
The sort of "solo" farm I occasionally do is at Silverwaste, you still want a RIBA map or a map with a squad or a commander taxi'ing in people, but you can do it at your own pace instead of running with a zerg. I just hang out in the Red/Purple/Yellow areas and tag the events there whenever I feel like doing some mindless farming.
---
Then I'll farm SMC for a month until I max out that achievement!
---
Everyone who knows any bit about wvw knows who etheri is so you shouldnt worry :)
---
Removed: Lowe effort / Low value post. 
---
Please [search](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=Gold+Farm&amp;restrict_sr=on) next time as there have been a number of recent threads discussing this already. 
---
&gt; 3) Pick a favorite quaggas color.
---
&gt; 4) Post a picture of your legendary with a flip phone. 
---
Do I get a combo bonus if I post the legendary quaggan shield?
---
Oh, nevermind, combos are no longer meaningful anyway lul.
---
Path of Exile or GW1 w/ heroes.  GW2 will never accommodate this in a meaningful capacity beyond grinding winterberries or harvesting nodes for currency like unbound magic or volatile magic because it opens the potential for mass botting. 
---
Acccording to your earlier comment you dont, which of those is a lie?
---
I'm fully aware of all that, although I don't think "quite respectable" gives the idea that I think the population is "truly massive" - which I don't, for the record. The point I was trying to make is that, by making a few fairly reasonable assumptions (namely, that some players spend no money on GW2, a handful spend a *lot*, and the majority spend at least some amount), we can roughly ballpark the population of the game based on information that is readily available. In other words, I was offering some hypothetical numbers to give us an idea of where we stand. I didn't intend to present them as hard facts, so sorry for any confusion.
---
I said most people don't. I didn't say I don't.
---
If she was trying to be stealthy and not alert the entire map to a ojs in that location she may have said "don't attack mobs".
---
This is why reddit is mostly shit and you can hardly have any meaningful discussion here.
---
over a week ago in a post about the unknown wvw announcement, someone talked about a siege mount, turns out they were correct and might have had insider knowledge. however i cant find that thread, i commented in it about mounts in contested areas
---
was it deleted? i cant find my comments let alone the thread.
---
Why you gotta bag on yourself, bro?
---
For a second I read that as “God help” for your title and thought, “you know that’s exactly how I felt when I came back and realized I was broke as shit.”
---
In all seriousness, there’s been a lot of changes but SW RIBA train(Silverwastes Red Indigo Blue Amber (color of pact base rotation) is from the sounds most profitable. Search and read a few posts about how to handle loot, such as what to salvage and what to sell. Rule of thumb for gear 85% or less than price of ecto salvage, more than ecto place sell order.
---
Many of the players excited for mounts seem confused as to why people think they could be a negative addition to the game mode. I wanted to lay out some of the main potential issues to help resolve that.
---
The currently announced [skills](https://www.mmogames.com/gamenews/guild-wars-2-wvw-mount-warclaw-announced/?fbclid=IwAR11j0rg19p7zuxd632YAapelh35JdY0mPZ7YHfZSccf9IqnzZWzgY1Bl0k), particularly the evade, look like a complete disaster for game balance that will permanently warp WvW combat around mounts.
---
Due to the lack of information we don't yet know if they will function as other mounts do in terms of being immune to all CC or what kind of healthpool they will have. If either of those are anywhere similar to PvE they would be additional balancing nightmares.
---
Higher map movement speed favors the group with more numbers for both attacking and defending, if the mount moves faster than 133% (base + swiftness) speed this would be another issue.
---
This is all aside from the development time put into mounts instead of core issues. Even with that being a problem I think most WvW players would be optimistic and accepting of mounts if they were confident it would not have a negative influence on the game.
---
And if the average is less that only makes his point stronger. 
---
&gt;Structured, logical, fact based criticism.
---
And you hit me with a restaurant situation and "Better class balance, the current meta is awful".
---
Ehhhhhh.
---
Yes it's deader than most but not really completly dead in eu at least, maybe you're in na? we can get at least 2-3 organised gvg every raid (we raid 3 or 4 times/week).
---
Might as well! 
---
We've seen: chrono nerf, spellbreaker nerf, firebrand and scourge nerf (still too OP, nerf more!), weaver nerf, scrapper nerf.
---
We can go back to the old meta of power reaper, condi mallyx herald and double Firebrand (Anet nerf it so we take two). What fun! 
---
The French have always been weird when it comes to translation, they tend to name stuff completely different from what it is in English for whatever reason. From their Pokemon(English, Italian and Spanish all use Charmander, but French uses Salameche), to their book characters(Professor Snape = Rogue). 
---
Pirate longbow. The one that looks like a ship's figurehead. 
---
Nice. I'll follow your guide for all the content they implement in the future.
---
Wow, that's quality shitpost!
---
Clearly this discussion is volatile, but as someone who just Fractals and Raids, can someone give a history of the plight of WvW-ers without shooting me? I wanna understand what your guys' side of the playerbase is going through, but I'm super out of the loop, and this thread just looks like a bunch of Charr were told they're going vegan.
---
Thats just really boring, because its just running around and hitting one button. And both "just" reward Gold. In raids and fractals you can archieve some loot, which is unique. I love SAB for that reason. You can do it alone and for some reward, which isn't "just" gold.
---
...baited?
---
More shit to render, double the amount of hp bars to register, and stuff
---
There's no achievement, just one shiny nothing :(
---
You didn't even read those 3 comments then
---
&gt; The biggest damage done to WvW was this subreddit telling players "they can run whatever they want in a zerg because it doesnt' matter" 
---
This isn't just a problem with new players, it's one of the biggest problems with the entire WvW community on the forums and reddit. There seems to be this idea that the game is entirely unbalanced if there is any kind of meta at all that is keeping people from playing whatever profession and build they want.
---
Over and over is just as much an exaggeration as "faster" is. Take the legendary ring for example, we're waiting since a year for one simple item. Anet also has a history of "forgetting" stuff, like the shadowstone, so asking over and over seems necessary.
---
Lmao weak ass gate keeping
---
At the same time, adding niche changes to slow but not completely stop the loss of veterans isn't going to do much to improve the number of players on its own.  
---
Adding an incentive for new players to enter WvW while simultaneously reducing pain points (less walking simulator, easier for zerglings to avoid ganks, more approachable siege) is actually a great way to bring life to the gamemode.
---
Remember like 6 years ago when all these responses actually happened and Anet fucked off and left WvW alone for like 4 years with nary a peep?
---
I 'member. Clearly you don't 
---
&gt; Criticism is necessary. Structured, logical, fact based criticism. So far we haven't had this kind of criticism in this sub regarding this future release.
---
Dude, come on. 
---
You say WvW, but interchange it with any other mode: Fract, Raid, etc. and it's all the same. FOH
---
As someone who just Fractals and Raids, can someone give me a calm rundown of the rage-splosion that is any discussion pertaining to WvW?
---
What are the legitimate grievances? What is people overreacting? I don't play or know anything about the gamemode and its update history.
---
I just hate the "static positioning" gameplay, it feels like the cheap tower rushes in strategy games. Constant positioning and moving is much more interesting.
---
I also prefer building an army of catapults, and then moving them towards an enemy base, instead of rushing and spamming them all of a sudden.
---
Aurene, Aurene, dragon full of light... 🎶
---
Ah yes the same skill it takes to buy a raid clear. Yup 400g for some bosses super skilled. I do pve raids got legendary armor finished all you currently can on legendary ring. WvW requires so much more effort and skill. Builds are always in flux server imbalances, all of the broken maps, yup I see where you think the skill is lacking.
---
While were at it can they throw in some 4000 gem skins for the new mount that strictly increase screen clutter and reduce server stability. 
---
That being said, a new 'wvw' black lion chest and 'wvw' black lion chest key that gave 'wvw' related goodies would be interesting. Make a reward track give one then leave the rest up to some other lame way to acquire them. I'd buy some with some gems I have left over, throw a skin or two in them for the new mount, make sure noone gets the skin but hey its gems. 
---
The numbers are never as generous as people think they are. They never lie, we just tell the wrong stories about them.
---
Even this post is sort of the wrong story, honestly, but I doubt people want the full detail, it wouldn't help anyone.
---
he only works on it part time :(
---
We'll know once we know the strength of their gate attack. My assumption is it will simply quicken the falling of the gate rather than being as powerful as conventional siege.
---
They promoted the potted plant, since it was there the longest.
---
I wonder what thief traits will they nerf without any real reason this time!
---
The last time I tried playing wvw, we wiped trying to take stone mist. The commander went on a 10 minute tirade in team chat about how no one knows what they're doing before untagging. Another player who was in the guild as the commander stayed online to make sure to call everyone mongoloids and declaring that "this is why we need eugenics."
---
This was after a singular wipe. I'm pretty newish to wvw. Not exactly a welcoming experience to say the least.
---
It doesnt help that they refuse to explain anything to anyone who doesn't use team speak. Despite team speak being a shitty program and it baffles me the server hasnt moved to a discord.
---
Sor ded your at the mercy of w/e your linked with
---
I know right? I was chuffed about the firework runes when they came out, but this is even better. 
---
Because wvw is not a competitive gamemode. It would be better of people accept this fact. This is the reason anet do not give frequent wvw balance patches to wvw because for them wvw is not about competitiveness based on comp or skill to kill others. Wvw is simply land grabbing game for points, even if you die 10times over, if you have towers you win. Wvw is more tactic oriented for them rather than fight oriented. Obviously they are not completely mutually exclusive but the main focus of anet is not where community think it is.
---
Yeah, ArenaNet's problems come from management, not individual developers.
---
Look at raids, they were a "side project", and they're by far one of the game's best content. Why? Because the assholes from management haven't put their dirty fingers on them, and the developers (the guys who know how the game works) could do their job without an incompetent bureaucrat pissing all over their design table.
---
The gem store team is also different from the development team itself. That's why sometimes the gem store stuff feels so out of place, and even breaks rules the development team set up for themselves.
---
The best thing that could happen to this game is management getting fired, and developers having more freedom to show their talent.
---
Never had issues with frames, but the servers already slow down to a crawl in large three-ways. Adding another layer to it without improving anything is just nuts.
---
Effort? Expensive.
---
The dragonwagon will rise again. I've been saying it for years, eventually I'll be right
---
If you are looking for a vacation from wow, GW2 is an EXCELLENT choice. Once you get the best gear in the game, you have it, on all toons that use that gear. This allows to to pick up and set down the game at your whim. The game plays very differently, and you are trying to get cool not power. If you are looking for a replacement, it needs to be because you are unsatisfied with WoW endgame, not looking for more of the same.
---
To be fair, if you go into a raid / high level fractal / competitive pvp group and haven't done any research on the meta, you'll probably get kicked / insulted as well.
---

No sense in name-calling. The Sylvari did nothing wrong. 
---
I do PvE exclusively, (never liked PvP centered games or modes)  but I think every game mode should be updated and loved equally. I do wish arenanet would throw more love at PvE but I also agree it’s disrespectful and depressing how they’ve basically thrown their leftover scraps to WvW instead of actually fixing the problem they made in the first place. And now what made WvW fun is gone. And will only be fixed when Arenanet actually cares for its users.

4 is extremely important. If you're not having fun because you hate literally everything, why should someone else enjoy themselves. It's Your job to crush them. Now go out there and spread that negativity! I believe in you!

Amazing
---
We have a business arrangement: they are not our friends.  Do you write this sort of posts defending your cable company?
---
I don't think you need insider knowledge to guess that one right, there were hints from anet in the past and since the announcement wasn't going to be about alliances and they still said it would be something "awesome" I think it's pretty obvious why several people said it's going to be a mount.
---
And mount in WvW obviously means that it has a siege function because WvW.
---
I'm so disappointed they didn't expand WvW tags.
---
Anyway, [some 2014 concept art](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/4/42/User_Lon-ami_Commander_tag_icon_suggestions.png) by yours truly.
---
Not wiping should be 8ncentive enough, meta is only 3 classes rn and they wanna add a cherry on top of this shit sunday
---
It's really sad it's like this. On release I loved wvw it was really fun and the people were chill. I took a break for a few years for college. 4 years later I come back and wvw is a shit show where everyone is just bitter and mean for no reason.
---
I really miss solo farming in GW1. I remember the early days of farming Ettins in Kryta or Griffons in Elona, and later on the more challenging FoW and UW solo farms. 
---
Even Drok's runs were a pretty unique means of making plat if you put the work in to learn the run. 
---
Granted some of these farms weren't by design and were really a byproduct of the game's multiclass system and the ridiculous amount of strange builds people came up with. The 55hp monk really launched solo farming the 8 man group content. 
---
Unfortunately GW2 was designed from the ground up to be very sharing is caring/group oriented so solo farming has never really been a thing. Also the way loot works in GW2 compared to GW1 and a more traditional MMO makes it so there really are NO items of value you can just go farm consistently for drops. 
---
Alchemist weapons, they're so pretty looking but people rarely use them
---
One counter point to increased mobility is that it means less penalty for dying when defending an objective. If a more skilled group is capping something and wiping the defenders then there should be a penalty for dying while defending instead of being able to get back quickly. If the mount is capped at swiftness speed than this is a non issue. 
---
The tl;dr was originally for a must shorter post, but I kinda went ham when rereading and added a bunch of stuff without changing that. 
---
It will be gated as mounts overall are gated behind the PoF. Same thing with gliding. If you dont own HoT you dont glide. It's just incentive for people to buy the expansion if they havent yet.
---
Came back to see what the exciting new announcement was.......Now I'm glad I still don't play
---
For everyone excited I'm happy for you, but as an ex GW2 player who's whole focus was WvW this is bad.
---
You want to see real brand corruption?
---
See what Activision and EA do to companies that get near them.
---
TFW you have to wait until the warclaw arrives before you can go back to farming the gift of battle to finish Eternity. the wait feels like eternity.
---

---
I’d love a permanent queens gauntlet type thing as a new type of end game replayable content. 
---
&gt; There are videos on most of the major exploits but there are ways to get into most of the major objectives without bringing siege due to gliding that have gone unfixed/unacknowledged for years.
---
Wanted to add it's not even required to glide for a plethora of those kind of exploits and they've existed since literally launch. I know a buddy of mine that likes to find all these out and he's gathered so many spots he can jump with rifle engi leap, DH F2, mirage leap, druid, daredevil vault etc. When it comes to the engi leap ones, those are literally as old as the game's existence. That goes to show how little care has been put there. That's 6 years in context.
---
You do!
---
The fact that you actually believe the complete opposite to this shows you mainly play a part of the game that receives constant support, and don't really know what you're talking about. 
---
This thread isn't "just asking people not to be shitty", it's overtly antagonizing us, calling us entitled and whiney and dumb, telling us we don't actually know what we want, etc.
---
Like, we're already pissed about the announcement being yet another disappointment. We're already pissed about alliances. We're already pissed about having been almost completely ignored for the last 7 years, or in some (rare) cases, directly antagonized by developers. And now we have a bunch of people who don't play WvW and have no idea how bad the situation is making posts about how we're crybabies for having very legitimate complaints, and being annoyed when those complaints go unanswered for years and years.
---
Anet is finally starting to do better with communication and community interaction which is great, but this mount thing completely came out of nowhere. Probably because they knew we'd tell them we didn't need it and the project was a misallocation of resources. So that's another reason people are mad.
---
Pretty much all dungeons and fractals are soloable.
---
I remember in TERA there were quests and instances where you would solo really large and relatively powerful enemies and get gold/items from them. 
---
I wish we had something similar in GW2. Bounties are close but they aren't intended to really be solo content, but rather small group open world content. 
---
But its not rewarding anywhere near the effort. And dungeons are to some extend not even soloable (CoE for example).
---
Until binding of ipos, I thought the Anomaly was the best looking one. It’s super simple, but also unique and nice looking. Close second was blade of light. Both are still pretty rare due to the cost of making them. 
---
I really hope they have some repeatable story mission reward system in the works (they probably don't, but I can dream right?)
---
Namtra of Doom would be a very interesting ability. Necro mantra spec anyone?
---
Honor of Humanity
---
You're the best my dude, I will get to trying it out as soon as possible!
---
The Guardian Elite Specialization Firebrand replaces the 3 profession signet-thingies (spontainiously forgot the name) with 'tomes'.
---
They're kinda like Engineer kits, but all skills can only be used a combined 5 times after which they go on long cooldowns.
---
They still retain the effect of signets (passive and active effect) from core Gaurdian.
---
Personally, I think they're epic.
---
The Tome cooldown increase seems to be a rumour. And I've no idea why it'd be needed for PvE in the slightest.
---
Two hours I guess. 
---
Mount hate is something though, since they can be utter garbage in other games, but yeah, some people really need to open their mind to new ideas now and then.
---
Nope
---
&gt; who in sane mind would make a mount gated in wvw only, making thousands of clueless people flood the maps in queue locking the actual players that know anything out, making guilds being unable to raid, making commanders unable to tag without 40 afk in spawn asking what is going on.
---
But that would last only a little time long, a few days, maybe a week. After that most PvE ppl have their Mount and leave the WvW players alone. It's only temporary.
---
&gt;mounts in pvp gamemode can be interesting, when you have servers that support it, right now they don't even handle normal wvw fights without skill lag
---
I don't think it's a server issue. I mean I don't play WvW that much, but when I play, I run with the zerg ofc. And I actually never had skill lags. I know it from early days when some Worldbosses and other zerg events caused skill lags, but these days are far gone. 
---
No matter if WvW or PvE zergs / worldbosses, skill lags isn't a current problem (for me). 
---
you say non satire but all i see is truth. i dont even like wvw and im getting pissed off at all the circle jerks of "be happy that you got anything at all"
---
Preach 
---
Did pocket raptors kill you again? You poor thing.
---
Look I know this is a bit minimizing to the genuine complaints coming out around this, but it has become clear since HoT that Anet was working to consolidate content in GW2. The fact is that the game has been steadily shrinking its scope since release as it became clear that the inital vision of the game required too many resources to support given its popularity. People continuing to play the game should expect by now that anything outside the core content (expansions, living world, fractals and raids) is going to only receive upkeep support, and should be happy at whatever changes they can get. sPvP to a lesser extent has gotten good support but now seems to be in a place where things are going to stay more or less stagnant.
---
Honestly I think we should be happy that this game is continuing to get quantity of content that it is. We live in an age of severe MMO decline, and the fact that I can still log into this game and very easily find people actually doing content is really incredible, nevermind that there is still such a large and active population. Not to say that we as a community should settle for less than what is the best outcome, but that the reality is that when you give it some cursory thought, it's seriously incredible that this game is still receiving updates at all when other title from larger publishers (cough cough Blizzard) are getting shafted. Sure the mount isn't the QOL and depth of content that the WvW core base wants, but the reality is that WvW isn't where the bulk of the playerbase lives, and unfortunately not likely a large source of cash flow. Because of that, the fact that there is still an effort to put quality, fair and not P2W content to that community is seriously awesome.
---
At PoF release I really thought that bounties would be soloable and were really appealing to me. But everything is behind a group search. And thats not fun imo. And rewards are the killer. I would like to see some content with drops like the weapons in raids. Even if it would be like farming mats and a really low chance on 'rare mats'. It would give a little reward. But it shouldn't be the main motivation.
---
What runs, just event after event? 
---
Ir a ball of yarn that disables the cat.
---
Nope. We don't know specifics about it at all. 
---
What we do know is that a dev has said that the total amount accounts on gw2efficiency (211075 active + inactive currently) is much smaller than the amount of active monthly players. 
---
We also know that ESO, one mmo larger, had about 2.5 million active monthly players in 2017. So a reasonable guess would be that that is the order of magnitude that gw2 is in also, something like 2 million monthly players.
---
Now you could haggle about how many hours per month counts as an active player, but that doesn't matter too much as long as the other mmo's are counted with the same metric. 
---
^(Extra: interestingly a dev recently did mention how those active players spend their time: 60% plays pve exclusively, 10% plays pvp/wvw, and 30% plays pve and pvp/wvw. In a GDC talk quite a while back they said that this third group plays the game the most and they result in the most gemstore income. (Which makes sense because if you just play everything you always get something nice in a patch, unlike for example raiders or wvw players. The 30% never feel left out while that is a big concern in the smaller subcommunities))
---
Warhorn Mesmer for a bard/music based class.
---
who says it'll last "maybe a week"? what if it requires rank 500 to unlock? how many pve babies will cry hardcore that they can't their mount in 30m of playtime?
---
and yes it's 100% server issue because when  they switched servers to amazon hosting in eu we haven't had lag for a few months but now it's back and it's fucking wild. 
---
It's called maybe I don't always want to be in a group, having to meet others expectations and just want to chill on my own but still playing the same game I love.
---
This is my biggest issue with the bullshit around this mount thing. There's legitimate stuff to bring up with balance, etc. that ARE things that ANet have avoided doing or clearly haven't thought through (Meteor Shower hyper buff, CoR, yadda yadda) but it's getting drowned out by these fucking limp fish in the comments section "BUH MOUNTS NOT WHAT I WANTED DED! DED! DED GAY MODE!"
---
I get that there's legit issues with WvW, but way too many people are 1. pretending that this mount is even coming from the WvW devs (hint, this is the work of general content artists and modelers and it's just being added to WvW) 2. ignoring the fact that the long walk times are one of the biggest detriments to WvW and 3. not imagining that the patch will actually come with useful balance changes, bugfixes, etc. that will also positively impact the game.
---
I get it! This wasn't an announcement for the alliance system! Big fucking whoop. It's still going to be a cool change that I think will positively impact the mode.
---
For one thing, the crybabies saying "muuuuhhhh, why can the mount tear down gaaaates for freeeee??": 1. We know literally nothing about this. It could be a bee's dick of damage to a gate. 2. Mounts are pretty easy to kill. The guards will probably do it on their own. 3. If this is a real problem, then put a fucking defender on your towers.
---
For another thing, the lack of movement on WvW maps is one of the last things that makes this game mode a chore to play. The reward degradation-removal was fantastic, because I no longer have to run around trying to do things for an hour to get my participation back up after I character swap to better adapt to the situation. Map-travel is useful for keeping zergs from constantly assaulting you/slowing their return, but even the most liberal implementation of mounts would just mean that your zerg needs to win the engagement once or maybe twice more. WvW is a game of morale. If you've beaten them once, do it again. If anything, this means your free bags will come to you faster!
---
There are 2 main issues with this whole thing 
---
1. As great as the mount may be, it is not what wvw desperately needs right now. There are other pressing issues that need to be addressed first. Had at least some of those issues were addressed prior or at the very least along with the release of mounts we would not have as many complaints.
---
2. The fact that anet failed to recognize points of balance in wvw time after time leaves many players worried that the mounts are going to create only more unbalance and issues. And top of that anet also was consistantly slow to react and to actually address  issues that some previous updates brought up so that is another concern for wvw players that if the mounts do have balance issues, it will take anet months to address them.
---
..If you think being in WvW with PoF and Mounts makes you experienced or at least not a new player... we have players who have been in game for a year and have the knowledge of pea. 
---
Not being insulting just as it is..There are still being months into this game think placing a rune into the boots will give the 6th rune ability
---
Not only this but there have been countless suggestions on the forums, in discords, in-game, and on reddit to help improve WvW.  They aren't nearly as big as adding an entire new mount.  There are also bugs in the game that have been around since launch.  This is why everyone has been making memes regarding the announcement being about mounts for two weeks.  Then for it to become true just became a huge joke, slap in the face, and even somewhat of a shock to the community.
---
I'm not sure if its a great analogy or not but I told a friend its kind of like telling a car company you want the color red for your new car.  They call you they got one in and you get there and its pink.  Sure, its red but its not what you asked for.  Now are you supposed to like it because they got you a shade of red or upset because its not what you wanted?
---
Lastly, the thing I've been telling people is that they need to accept this is WvW.  Stop expecting things that won't happen and certainly don't let it get you overly upset.  You just have to take it or leave it at this point.
---
I've always dreamed of Anet, posting a state of projects blog post once a month updating us on the advancements they're making on all 3 modes. Even if little, even if issues arise, I'd love that transparency. I think that of all things would keep the expectations in check way better if they were open about why things are not working well, even go into technicalities for the ones who do understand developing software or games if they wanted. Have this connection that let's us really understand what's limiting them and how they have breakthroughs. I know people believe this leads to people taking for granted that certain features are coming and when they have to cancel something, they throw fits but how is completely in the dark any better? People ALREADY make assumptions, take things for granted as for sure something Anet promises even when they don't that I personally see no added problem with them being more open on what they work and what is not gonna work for us. It would make the waiting time a lot more bearable than what we have now.
---
"We want updates. No not *those* updates!"
---
"We want better rewards. Ugh but now you've attracted the PvE'rs, worst update ever."
---
And my personal favorite:
---
"We need a population rebalance because our game mode is dying. Ugh gtfo PvE carebears you're ruining the game mode."
---
Silverwaste is my favorite meta map, because it has unstoppable action.
---
I just made a post about the Devs being Snow Flakes. 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/assuon/why\_are\_arenanet\_devs\_such\_snow\_flakes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/assuon/why_are_arenanet_devs_such_snow_flakes/)
---
I agree with you on your assessment as I originally thought you were complaining about the people expressing their displeasure with Anet.
---
We used to be able to craft in we've but that brought to many people in that just took up a server slot and only stayed near the crafting stations.
---
&gt; populations weren’t as low
---
I view that as an argument for the mounts rather than against it. You’re not going to drive people to the game mode with “arrow carts do 20% less damage” or “radius of (X) reduced by 30% in WvW only” patch notes, even if those would fundamentally change the dynamics of party v zerg fights in T3 fortified keeps. Most non-WvW players have no idea what changes would fix/break/change the WvW meta.
---
You need something big and accessible to bring people in. Mounts are the best option in that particular box.
---
It's like this all the time on tumblr and the forums too tbh
---
How long does that take?
---
&gt; You'd think they would be better at defending keeps and towers with gatekeeping like this
---
The game favors defense a lot, it's not defending that needs to be improved but assaulting structures.
---
See, that's how it's easy to tell you're not a WvW player. :^) *(humor)*
---
THANKS! They have it for 20€, much better than getting it from ANET for 30€ - since god knows when the next sale will be
---
Well when you have ignored most of the WvW community for the last 6 years what do you expect.  
---
The WvW community was WAY bigger than this!  
---
There were more servers in both EU and NA  
---
The map limit was higher  
---
There was no need for linking  
---
There was no need for Alliances.  
---
But when you do nothing but the absolutely bare minimum for a game mode, players leave!  
---
The gemstore has absolutely nothing for WvW  
---
Players asked for siege skins, tower skins etc.  
---
Anet still did nothing  
---
Wave after wave of WvW players left each year.  
---
But hey, GW2 epsorts FTW right!  
---
All that money they threw at it was well worth it!
---
Man, you know when enemy is near just by the lag they make. You can guess the numbers too.
---
You can see if there is a 3-way on the map, by standing in spawn and looking at lag...
---
Or they'll do their time-tested Arenanet special of nerfing 1 thing but buffing 2 other things and leaving things worse than before. 
---
You should watch their livestreams, they do have passion, they just are not allowed to hype their community cause in the past that made players expect things that in the end didn't deliver, and they don't want that.
---
Man the Potted Plant has quite a resumé - developer for TF2 and now GW2's WvW dept.? Impressive!
---
Do you believe anet won't release the mount just because you trashed it before it was released?
---
The elemental scroll offhands are still some of my fave skins, they just look cool.
---
My favorite skin is the HoM staff skin though, it’s perfect for necros.
---
So stay out of squads? Nobody goes around interrogating roamers to see if their builds make sense.
---
I remember back when I got a notice on official forums for using the word 'lazy' to describe living world vendors always having mini-pet, recipe, trinket. XD
---
This is a great alternative perspective.  Thank you for sharing.  I’m not opposed to these cosmetic transactions to keep a Buy to Play game afloat (and especially for a F2P game).  But I when I, personally, choose to invest my money into a game I like to know what it’s being used for.  Which, upon further reflection, a roadmap would be nice so we know what’s in the pipeline and what’s coming.  Are they working on one thing at a time?  What’s this “new process” to churn out faster and “expansion quality” content?  Should we just take their word?
---
While I have smaller qualms with certain practices (like removing items from the store to manipulate buyers into purchasing before it’s “gone”), I think it’s important to recognize that there isn’t any inherent agreement that buy pumping money into the store we get a meaningful return.  And when I say meaningful return, if we spend, combined, say 100k a month, are we the players getting a return on *our* investment?  Are they putting 100k of content into the game?  10k?  1k?  A box of cookies?
---
Right now I feel like the community and the devs (in general) are at odds because we want to support and continue to play these games but people are not happy with the prices.  Meanwhile, the devs continue to look for ways to produce the most value for stockholders for the least amount of effort.
---
A roadmap and frequent community updates would solve a lot of these problems.
---
I mean it’s easy to cast this off entirely on PvE/pvpers, but perhaps not all wvwers share the “wvw community opinion.”  It’s not a monolithic entity afterall 
---
I highly recommend Kourna. It gets a bad rap for being an unfinished map, but it's my go-to for solo farming. Almost everything there can be done by yourself, respawn rates for mobs is high, get karmic enrichment on top of the volatile magic and gear, and you'll be getting plenty of rewards that can be converted into gold. 
---
Other than that, it's pretty easy to jump into certain meta events like Auric Basin. The Octovine is basically a DPS golem and even if the group is unorganized it's really hard to fail. 
---
There are a lot of questions and a lot of negativity around player concerns which are related to these questions, all of which could have easily been avoided through transparency and player - developer communication. I'll list the questions I encountered from the top of my head:
---
1 - Will there be a mounting station which can be added through guild objective claiming system, or will the mounts be available everywhere?
---
2 - Will it be restricted to gliding allowed areas?
---
3 - Will there be a cooldown timer or can you mount immediately when out of combat?
---
4 - Will the mount require supply to summon?
---
5 - Flame rams are out of the game now?
---
6 - Will the chain require supply to set up?
---
7 - Will there be a rank / mastery limitation to prevent PvE scrubs filling the maps?
---
8 - It took you this long to add something which was already available in the game?
---
Feel free to add more below. 
---
What are you smoking? They take critiscisim everyday on reddit and the forums, but calling developers out for being snowflakes is a bit much, especially from someone who admits they don't play the game anymore. 
---
They've had over 6 years of constructive criticism. Their continued mishandling of WvW over the years has pretty much neutered the game's population. 
---
Eventually people reach a breaking point
---
There's critisism and then there's the change REEEEEEEEE that makesvup the bulk ofvthe feedback.
---
Ppl are complaining about this new mount like anet added the griffon or something
---
Amidst all the snark and sarcasm going around, this is an insightful and important observation to make.  There is *some* burden of responsibility on the *player* to understand your goals, objectives, class, etc before going into a competitive mode.  WvW is full of highly competitive people who like to dominate and understanding that is part of clicking with the community.  It's essentially going into someone's match and cluelessly messing up and then using ignorance as an excuse...which doesn't help when your teammates feel like they lost because half their allies don't really understand the objectives in the game-mode and they unless they know otherwise they will assume that you know what you're doing.  If you don't know something, ask.  Don't expect that strangers' job is just to randomly educate you.  
---
One hour per run. I did it twice so it took me two hours. 
---
You realize the people monitoring the forums really aren't devs right? They had their big push to have community monitors a few years back and that's when the infractions started going up because people get reported for anything.
---
&gt;Before anyone posts the they get death threats/ect please this is 2019. The wild wild west of the internet from the 90's is long gone.
---
Says a guy who actively posts on r/the_donald
---
5. Tell them they should stop complaining and welcome changes even though we do literally the same but whiny wvwers amirite?!
---
&gt;Im a games developer myself. We do what we love, but it is a job at the end of the day. I take criticism, I improve what im doing. Criticism is not, and to be clear, not evil. And yes, their content rate is slow. If you want a comparison google the content releases of final fantasy 14, as compared to guild wars 2. b
---
Odd you point to FFXIV with your post on criticism. FFXIV devs literally ignore all criticism of their game unless you're Japanese.
---
I guess my problem with these metas is the timer. I would like to hop on and off on my solo adventures without the hussle of finding a group, coordinating stuff etc..
---
Last balance patch reduced class viability to 3, stop acting like this patch will solve that
---
Oh, you are absolutely right. And those players are just as toxic. The difference is when you go into a raid/high level fractal/competitive PvP group, you chose to be part of said high level, 'meta' group(unless the PvP matchup was random) and you can easily leave those groups and join another if people get too salty. When you go into WvW, you don't have a choice of who to play with.
---
You have a lot of straw man arguments and attacking me directly because you don’t like my vocabulary?  If you can edit your post to be more civil I’ll be glad to engage you in conversation.
---
By the way, free updates along with expansions are the norm, not the exception.  I am not sure where this idea that microtransactions fuel all this “new content” in games.  See a similar post I made recently.
---
They live in a bubble.  They sit in there only letting praise and fluff through while filtering everything else out.  When they release something they do it with zero prior information or any discussion to avoid criticism and retreat back to their bubble.
---
Anyone remember when a dev intentionally BM'd two guilds fighting each other in WvW?  "I'm watching you guys violate my game mode"
---
More lootboxes!!!!!! 😍
---
It whiteknights until it aligns with their very specific gameplay they fancy. Now don't you dare tell them they can't complain about their shit. Turns out open world pve is the big one that rules it all :/
---
OK, so not istan level farming, but a decent alternative to do to mix things up. Thanks for sharing :)
---
This hits way too close to home....
---
It's still better than going in blind.
---
I like to imagine how things would actually be without the limits and constraints of game development and the medium. 
---
I imagine Divinity's Reach way bigger, bigger than a city in an open world game like prototype and GTA, with labyrinthine corridors and an untouched Canthan District. Walking from side to side would take you more than half a day. 
---
For this fight, I imagined not just the singers, but many more musicians and siege, and way more of them on the terraces, with several different instruments, and the music almost becoming solid among them and emanating forward, turned into magic. 
---
The music certainly matches that more than what we actually got in-game. 
---
What are the major differences in monetization between GW2 and the others?
---
Why are you just pulling random numbers out of the air to prove your point?
---
To add on what u/TireurEfficient has said, it's also because those words have a meaning, and that meaning doesn't come through if the original name is kept. "Snape" means nothing in French, but [Rogue](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rogue#Etymology_2) does, same with the [Pokémon names](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Charmander_(Pok%C3%A9mon\)#In_other_languages).  
---
The translators have to take into account the fact that young children, and frankly a large part of the population, don't have enough knowledge of English to understand what the names are supposed to convey about the characters, if left untranslated.
---
&gt; If you don't know something, ask.
---
Read the stories above. People have and do ask. WvWers just seem to not care. They expect everyone to be top level instantly and won't accept anyone else.
---
TIL that online death threats are strictly a 90's thing.
---
Of course they buy the skins but it's still a separate part of the game and they will need funding to make it worth it to them also.
---
Thanks for the advice guys. I guess i should have said that yes, i plan on trying the condition renegade build with viper gear
---
yes we need mounts so that dying wont mean as much because you can get back to the fight faster, capturing towers/keeps might be harder because of this
---
I go mining my dude i make over 10g a toon mind you thats unlimited gathering tools with glyphs 
---
I dig it, I laughed.
---
Next season: We follow Kralkatorrik to Cantha to find that the Jade Sea is now the Amethyst Sea.

Necros still OP, Weaver still fucked due to difficulty of rotation compared to DPS.

End patch.

I did an Auric Basin meta last night and my squad got filled so I can say with absolute certainty that there are more than 50 people playing GW2.
---
And Charr which is like every commander. XD
---
You asked for structured, logical, fact based criticism, and then ignored it when he provided it.
---
Not to mention the art of clipping for Bethesda
---
and you would have harder time figuring out what the hell is almost everyone else talking about
---
My favorite black is Glossy Black, has the dark color but you can still see the textures on it. 
---
Think of caps as huge excitement.
---
Actually there are huge WvW communities in the background and sudenlly everyone that still plays saying: OMG, OMG, OMG COMBAT ACTUALLY GOT FUN (again)!!! And they reworked points, so that winning matchup actually means something.
---
AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT!!!!! THEY ADDED, THEY ACTUALLY ADDED GVG, GVG CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!! And what's more, it has leaderboards and weekly match system so that guilds representing different servers can compete for that servers bonuses for next week.
---
Now that would be exciting news.
---
The person it is directed towards, if you take it literally, doesn't exist. It's a bullshit strawman that mischaracterizes WvW players' behavior to make us look unreasonable. You can say "oh its just hyperbole" or "learn to take a joke", but at the end of the day the only purpose this thread serves is to smear WvWers for not being thrilled about a feature we don't need.
---
Correct me plz lord of correction
---
I had a thread some time ago where, once there wasn't a lot of activity anymore (few hours old), suddenly over the span of 10min a new post appeared and got gilded with like 500 upvotes, stealing the top of the conversation.
---
Call it a conspiracy, but I've suspected of vote manipulation multiple times over the years. I don't know who could be behind it (ArenaNet itself, fanboys believing they're helping [they're not], etc), but sometimes it's incredibly shameless. I only noticed because I monitor threads I post closely, since I appreciate everyone who replies and try to reply back, and that one came right out of the blue, completely changing the course of the thread's conversation (which was critical of ArenaNet).
---
Agreed.  Sure there is open world but talking more.
---
I think they should make everything balanced around numbers.  That is have everything be solo if you choose it to be.  But for each person you add, have it truly scale. 
---
Then everyone has their choice.  Want to play solo, you can.  Want to play with just one good friend, you can.  Want to play with 5 people, go for it.  10, go for it.
---
People who want to play with others can, people who don't want to, also get a choice.
---
If people can't stand that idea, then increase rewards when groups are involved but at the rate of 1% more per person.  So a 10 person group gets the max of 10% more rewards for doing exactly the same thing as a solo player, but gets that 10% bonus only for playing with more people.
---
So many people are focused on min/maxing the game and all about rewards, they'll go get max players for everything.
---
This makes all instanced content from dungeons to fractals to raids available from solo to 10 man groups.  Just make everything truly scale.
---
The only difficult thing would be scaling tactics and puzzles created originally for groups.  But you can make something else that gives the same level of difficulty while being different.
---
To clarify, no content should be made easier.  A 10 person fractal should be as hard as doing it by one person if it scales correctly.
---
Additionally, include a hard mode later on.
---
The engi monocle is great for your steampunk needs. And who doesn't have steampunk needs?
---
Watch Split.
---
According to the Up Next section on that gfycat link, what follows the brand corruption is a lot of human female meta.
---
I have a revenant I roleplay with and every time he gets a new piece of head armor I change it back to the blindfold because it's cool and suits the class
---
It was the only thing we got after a long content draught. An 11 second trailer with a ton of reused shots from other trailers.
---
Watch the Fight Club and you'll understand.
---
~~Omg~~, don't make me feel old!
---
Still a lot of valid criticism against the mount though, especially the fact that it’s coming out when WvW is in such a horrible state
---
1. Dungeons have story mode
---
2. Most of the dungeons are soloable
---
3. Since HoT their difficulty is a joke
---
4. The dungeon loot is account bount
---
I can't imagine why some people are turned off by WvW
---
can't you rent a beetle for 10 silver if you want to participate in the "new" mount races? Haven't done so yet but thats what the wiki said.
---
I think there may be "influencers" or whatever their name is, that get all the praise when they post at the right time.
---
I had a similar thing sometimes, I posted a meme about Aurene, nobody cared, or even downvoted. A day later another guy, which had more karma / was more active probably, reposted the same meme and got upvoted to the top. Happened with normal posts too.
---
The Reddit logic I guess...
---
Must be amazing to know without a shadow of a doubt the exact thoughts of an entire company about their own job
---
None of that looks like it can be done right until they implement alliance and can get better data of skill usage, participation and exploitability of the content.
---
Now, as soon as alliances get done, they better get to it.
---
How do all the dicks in anet's department taste like? Since I don't whiteknight for them I'd like to hear it from someone who seems to do it gladly. 
---
I'd you insist on it being an MMO, I can't, because all MMOs have the same problem - you cannot reconcile the differences in gameplay between a PvE and PvP environment, one has to be sacrificed for the design of the other, and it is usually PvP on the losing end.
---
But, I don't see why people insist on looking to an MMO for PvP at all.  Ever since LoL blew up a decade ago, the industry has pumped out PvP games like a factory, if anything it is more difficult to find these days, it's good PvE.
---
Adding people on the short term will work from a mount, but if the other massive issues with WvW aren’t fixed soon, people won’t stay. Imo fixing the game mode and then adding the mount would attract new players and retain them, rather than having them leave after realising that a mount is less important than some other fixes.
---
I mean they have basically been neglected for 6 years
---
Yeah, that could be people begging for downvoted outside reddit, like in a discord chat, and having his whole guild vote.
---
What I was talking about is more on the line of multi-accounts or just upvote bots.
---
Look it's another retard mom, I wonder how many times this one was dropped as a baby. 
---
I'll leave this here:
---
https://youtu.be/m90hUvVhSDE?t=18
---
Low effort?? dude i am on a time limit! i have an hour to play 
---
Perfect
---
Well I can't, because their reactions are allways the same
---
Sure they want some specific changes, and that is fine, but throwing a tantrum everytime a change that isnt what they wanted is implemented is just... childish?
---
And I dont get why they are so shocked with a mount being added
---
Its legit the content that has brought more money to them after PoF, and lets be honest, ANet needs to make money. It will also get a lot of ppl to WvW, but I'm sure the elitist there will do a good job keeping most of them away after ppl get the mount 
---
And this also doesnt mean that what was already anniunced wont come, I'm sure it will, but then again it's ANet, I'm sute alliances are here by 2021
---
Most do, and most have good reason to dislike this mount as well
---
We all know gimmick builds and over-rewarding content is bad for the game in the long run, but players will naturally flock to them, and grow dependent on them.
---
It's a rather annoying effect.
---
Instead addressing the situation ASAP, they leave things working for so long that people get used to them. By then, if they try to change it, the backlash will be much greater. 
---
A big thing that will help you is to enforce proper party composition by creating the lfg entry yourself. With a proper party, you'll have supports that both increase the damage the party deals so that dangerous fights end faster, and also give you defensive buffs and heals to keep everyone alive. 
---
Just create an lfg entry that says something like; "t4 lf: druid, chrono, bs, power dps". If you can't find a druid after 10 minutes, it's okay to just search for any healer. If you can't find a bs, you can replace it with another power dps in a pinch but the group's damage and CC will go down. 
---
Make sure you stay close to melee range at all times when you have a druid and chrono in the party. All their support boons and heals will be happening in melee, so if you run away, you're actually putting yourself in more danger.
---
4 overloads a day is still more than what most people use currently
---
I do not really understand how could you talk so much about WvW developers when we still don't have build templates, fix it dice!
---
Legit death threats from Gamers today are easily traced by law enforcement. Back then it wasn't so nor did the authorities really do anything.
---
You know they didn't just pull this mount out of their asses right? That this mount has been in the works for some time now. This is most likely taking from shit they've already had worked on. Looks like a combination of the canceled spider mount and WvW mount rumored about from the start of PoF. They said they are working on the stuff you complain about btw so that still is happening; yet you get another goodie and you itch. Anet has delivered an astounding game and all you people do is itch while totally disregarding the good with the bad. Mob of salt. It's a good game but has flaws get over it. 
---
Whoa Blast from the past! Thats the old Yishis build. :D
---
It was really fun back in the day but now its really holosmith or you're screwed.
---
True, but that’s not unique to WvW at all. There are many posts and comments which specifically detail wanted changes, and these changes have never come.
---
I certainly agree!
---
As I've come to understand it, WvW needs some continued support, not just a single fix that will supposedly solve everything.
---
Step one would be fixing the inherent problems so people aren't driven away by the existing status quo. It struck me that, as this thread has demonstrated, that's really all people are asking for because their expectations have become so bare-bones.
---
Step two would be, as you said, to find a way to bring in new people with shiny new things.  With the holes patched up and the maps full again, this should make the game mode healthy again.
---
Step three would then be innovation, in the same way ANet is constantly trying to innovate on Living World and PvE. This could be where things get really interesting, but this can't happen until the game mode is in a healthy state.
---
I'm sorry, but that's a 9/10.
---
Next time, take the screenshot in the oil fields of Thunderlord Peaks.
---
Although mounts have a much larger risk factor, and when HoT was released, WvW was in a much better place
---
&gt;Perfect
---
wut
---
Good thing white paint is cheap
---
I think you should look up the definition of satire, this isn't it.
---
Tar, although it is is ever so slightly blue.
---
Butting into this I've also server hopped a lot recently. It depends a lot on the server and whats happening at that moment tbf. TC and BG for example are a lot more lax (for different reasons), they will usually respond and help. + open to the average pug. Kaineng or GoM who are known to be competitive and have a lot of trained/skilled players may or may not. Each server has a personality thats been built over 6 years. 
---
I've never seen anyone yelled at for asking noob questions in map... UNLESS the map/world chat is being used for intense situations. If someones talking or asking questions interrupting the information people are going to get mad. I don't blame them for that, use common sense.
---
In my experience if you run around and participate trying your best to survive and not be a dumb green tag and are *willing to change your build/elite spec* to what your com needs in squad you'rd usually going to be OK. A lot of PvE pugs start off defensive and unwilling to adapt to better fit the group, thats where issues arise. Then theyre rallybots, and it will ruin fights.
---
Endure, learn and be willing to change or maybe the modes just not for you. 
---
What does the fact I've posted there have anything to do with the statement you've quoted?
---
This thread has nothing to do with politics actually
---
It's because our language is created and regulated by The Academie Française, which is composed of old people that are very much still following the Charles de Gaulle's ideology of " La Grandeur de la France".
---
Even in younger people, keeping French culture ( and the " french exception " ) alive despite growing globalization is a pretty important thing to us. 
---
&gt; I get that there's legit issues with WvW, but way too many people are 1. pretending that this mount is even coming from the WvW devs (hint, this is the work of general content artists and modelers and it's just being added to WvW) 
---
Who is blaming specific devs? I personally blame anet as a whole, mainly the higher ups.
---
Heavy Order of Whispers chest was really underrated for a long time, then it exploded in popularity some day.
---
Nowadays, I'd say the heavy triumphant armor from WvW is really great, among the best-looking heavy armors.
---
Acknowledging the problem exists doesn’t suddenly mean you can take it out of the discussion. It seems you think that’s how this works.
---
Do you play WvW? Do you understand how overdue the updates we're asking for are? Alliances were announced around a year ago and we still don't have a release date because there's basically one developer working on it, poor guy. You have to understand that we've needed alliances since around 2014 and the problem has only gotten worse since then. The game has been bleeding WvW players at an alarming rate for years, and we're about to lose the last few dedicated hardcores that at this point are essentially relics of a bygone era. The top guilds and groups are already largely comprised of the same group of ~50 good players spread out across various guilds, and if those people quit, I assure you you'll see the effects almost immediately.
---
You are funny and all but let's also remember the fact that Mirage was nerfed in ALL of the last 7 balance patches (dating back to early 2018, I was lazy to check more updates).
---
I think the overreaction is due to the fact that they have been neglected for years
---
&gt; they just come and go without fanfarre, without passion, as if they were more of the same instead of something exciting. As if ArenaNet were just doing their job, instead of something they love.
---
man they just *cannot* win.
---
whenever they *do* use the slightest bit of excitement then they're met with a wall of complaints about how they keep over-hyping everything.
---
I assume it will take wvw tickets too.
---
Aww how cute. :)
---
Lmfao even the subreddit wants to quarantine WvW topics to one easily ignorable place. 
---
Funny how its only zealotry when you disagree with it.
---
Yeah, we do need to speculate, and that just brings up issues with Arena Nets communication 
---
I'm not going to repeat myself in every single comment I make in a given thread. If what I have stated in any of my comments is too complex for someone to comprehend, then it's not my problem.
---
I think people vastly overestimate how moving around faster won't change them not enjoying dying super fast to things they do not understand, having to play builds they don't like and simply feeling like they're at a loss on how to get into what WvW is about.
---
I don't think people underestimate what you're saying, I'm pretty sure this happens all the time. What I believe the majority of the nay-sayers camp I'm in believe is the mount is not gonna be enough to convert players into enjoying the game mode especially when it's in one of the worst state it's ever been.
---
The others are pay to win shitfests. Guild wars 2 is mostly cosmetic at the end of the day 
---
You know I didn't even think about the bird memes but that's totally true isn't it. I was constantly seeing them either on FP or low effort ones being downvoted and everyone complaining about stuff. But since I don't do that content, I had no clue what it was about and just ignored it.  
---
As I'd said in my comment in this very thread, perhaps next time I won't ignore it. I'll stick my big fucking nose in their business because fractals, raids and other unrelated content effect my game mode and I think the devs are being treated poorly for their efforts.
---
So in case things aren't clear:
---
Ixxi is a Botanist and owns a Botanic Garden outside of Rata Sum, she has a pet Fanged Iboga called Igo.
---
Seti is/was an Inquest Guard but escaped with a human thief.
---
Seti and Ixxi are now a couple. They often relax at the Hidden Garden. (One of my fav places in-game)
---
Now I have to make another one with my Mesmer Asura Enya haha. If you're interested in more you can follow me on Tumblr: [http://ilona-art.tumblr.com/](http://ilona-art.tumblr.com/) :)
---
Problem is they replaced the holy trinity with "DPS and a buff guy" then later implemented a watered down version of the holy trinity.
---
No there’s a pretty basic consensus of features and fixes WvW needs, Anet just doesn’t listen
---
&gt;How about everyone just shut the fuck up about this and wait until it's fully released before we make judgement.
---
This is advice that should apply to any update, really.
---
I want to play WvW but it's a fucking slog running everywhere and there's no incentive to hold anything since you get more WvW XP from losing stuff and taking it back. At least that's my perception as an amateur, so even if it's not true, it's a bad perception to be generating. Gaining rank feels like such a chore that it's basically like "why bother?"
---
I know the WvW community wants people to play the game mode because it's fun, but fun isn't enough in MMORPGs. You've gotta get something out of it that makes it feel worth the time investment.
---
When did they call the players toxic? I'm almost certain that you're making this up...
---
I want you to know that this is beyond beautiful and that I ADORE people talking about their characters~
---
I agree. For a game so reliant on fashion, quality costumers should be its top priority.
---
I would give tempest a try. A lot of the damage comes from the overloads and you can move/kite while channelling them. Or try sceptre or staff weaver. 
---
I am sorry but it is so obvious that you have no clue what you are talking about and i can not take your answers serious because most of them are written with Disney Glasses. I can answer this though the last thing you wrote is even more showing how little you know. First of all the big update is not comming by a long while. a LOOOOONG while which the dev it self keep on telling. Same dev have also answerd the questions about the issues and told us that none of them will be solved by alliances. So there you go. 
---
Have a nice evening.
---
Dunno, sometimes my costumer is pretty rude when bringing my outfit for the day. I don't need constant reminders of my belt size, tyvm. 
---
Metabattle is a start, even if not perfect I don't think there are other resources updated atm.
---
If you ask your server for their TS / discord / forums, most of them have builds available there as well. Better ask them before the update hits, then you'll also have a basic idea of where your server is organised and how to join them once the patch comes. 
---
Inquest Shoulders, one of the only medium shoulder skins that doesn't float on a small charr.
---
The Royal Ascalonian set is also pretty, the shield in particular has a fantastic day/night transformation I like to use in lieu of any Mad King weapons.
---
I started the moment you could craft precursor. I had fases in wich i would craft a little, and then quit since it took too much effort and the daily cap in material crafting did not help. I also played the game on and off. 
---
I recently looked at my mats and came to the conclusion that i almost had enough to craft it, maybe invested another 50g.
---
Now i'm off to do my world completion, since i accidentally deleted my old Main i have to start that over as well.
---
I can't wait to be done with that shit. 
---
Other Reddit’s users are using this, do not do it
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/asrm6c/the_toxic_nature_of_the_playerbase/?st=JSDPCUBV&amp;sh=8740ce54
---
This could be a game.
---
in GW2 there are three types of instanced content: Dungeons, Fractals and Raids
---
Dungeons: This is 5 player content which is split into different modes, a story and explorable mode. Those modes are generally different in the level you can do them and how they are "presented". In the explorable mode, you have different paths that you can complete. On completion, you will get Dungeon tokens that you can trade in for Armour, Weapons, runes, etc.
---
Though you should know that Dungeons are not officially supported anymore because their format couldn't be maintained without a lot of work. However, despite popular belief, they are not dead and you can find a party by submitting an LFG by yourself.
---
Fractals: this can be viewed as a replacement for Dungeons. Fractals are split int 100 levels over 4 Tiers with 20 different Fractals. Each level is increasingly harder and each of those different fractals looks and behaves differently than the rest. At a certain fractal level, you will be get affected by a new type of damage, agony, which can only be compensated by equipping ascended gear and slotting infusions with agony resistance into this gear. Only ascended and legendary gear offer those infusion slots. generally, you will find +1 infusions (so +1 agony resistance) and you can craft them into higher +2, +3, +4 etc Infusions by spending the double amount. Which means 2 x +1 = +2 and so on. I should mention that fractals are also 5 player content and generally not that long to complete.
---
Raids: Raids are for everyone who wants to have a challenge. They are not easy but also not hard if you spent the time to get to know the game and your profession. It is 10 player content which means you need to own the commander tag to be able to open a raid group (or any group larger than 5 players). Currently, there are 4 raids, 2 for Heart of Thorns owners and 2 for Path of Fire owners. Some of those raids are split into wings, like a subsection, which consists of a couple of boss fights that can be killed to clear the wing. The clearing of those wings behaves pretty much as other games because you have a weekly reset. But that doesn't mean you only can kill them once per week! no, if you beat a boss this progress will be saved for you but you can still join another group to kill the boss again, as long as the person who opened the raid instance hasn't killed the boss. I'm unsure about loot, however (if you will get the boss chest even though you have beaten it already IIRC that is not the case). You also have a currency in raids that you can trade in for various things like gear and other things, this currency has a weekly cap!
---
Raids are nothing scary really, when you are level 80 you can start with raids. Simple as that. It might be a bit harder because you might lack the appropriate gear and build but all those things can be acquired rather quickly. Though I would first try to learn how the current meta is, getting a meta build and learning it. The more prep work you do the smoother will the kill or you could join a training guild that teaches the encounters.
---
But Raids in GW2 are a lot different than in other games like WoW. The last time I played Raids in WoW which was in 2011 I did the Cataclysm raids and after the tank getting the aggro you pretty much could do anything you want. This is a bit different because there are a lot of mechanics that keep the rest of the group on their toes. They are not hard on their own but can be a bit overwhelming when you are positioned correctly or have bad luck. But raids are a lot of fun if you like challenging content and plan to get better at the game.
---
No true satirist would do whatever this is!
---
Eh, maybe a tad *too* horrible.
---
[Crystal Guardian](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystal_Guardian_(skin))
---
Randomly got this skin as a drop back in the day. Thought it looked super sick compared to the other nongem store skins and used it exclusively for like five years before I decided to cave and buy the alchemist greatsword skin.
---
We've seen these rushes of PvE players in WvW before. The majority don't stay, that's the issue.
---
What PvE players actually do is make long queues pushing out the daily WvWers, won't join Discord/TS3 so not in squad, rallybot because of PvE gear and won't bother learning/AFKs for points.
---
It only irritates WvWers and degrades the overall experience for everyone. The servers and fights are awful.
---
Then once they get whatever they are there for / see the new content (mount in this case), they leave until the next event.
---
I'd feel different if people stayed, but history shows this will be a temporary flux.
---
Can't stand the swords. The blades just seem too short. But the rest is amazing.
---
Ok.
---
But what about... [Evon Dusk](https://i.imgur.com/CRvnJkF.png) ?
---
So we wished for things for soon to be 7 years that none of them have still not been implemented or even talked about, so do not tell me i am weaing rose colored glasses because i would love to see how you feel about Devs not give a single thing you want for PvE in nearly 7 years. That is badly handled. Period.
---
Would love to see them revamp dungeons as an answer to this allowing teams of:
---
1 person, 3 persons &amp; 5 persons and scaling the difficulty based on the team size and targeting a 15 minute timeframe for each path.
---
Revamp the rewards system to a unified dungeon token with ascended options like wvw, pvp, etc. has.
---
but wait.. Anet is *our* costumer =)
---
"Shut up and take it."
---
That’s not correct, we are anets costumers. 
---
They aren't calling their customers toxic, though. No one is a customer, unless it's the devs themselves doing it. 
---
Frankly, I'd argue that in some cases they are just stating fact. Some people in gaming really are toxic.
---
Yeah it’s been the “holy duo” plus that chrono guy it seems for while
---
I really like all the modes the game offers, but most of the time I join PvP or WvW I get hated on. BUT I also head some great experiences, there are nice players out there. I don't play those modes nearly as often as PvE because I lack peoplw to do it with sadly.
---
You not being able to see it do not make it less true. But it is ok i can wait until the mount are in game and you will soon see the issue all by your self and can then decide if you feel it is ok or not.
---
Unless I see a press release or live stream of Anet actually saying those words, I call BS and never believe it. 
---
Yes, the community has its issues, and yes, Anet sometimes doesn't listen, but the last think a F2P game is going to do is attack its customer base by calling us, "toxic."
---
OP needs to be clear when posting so that it isn't misunderstood. It comes across as if he meant Anet said it, but probably pulling it from some other user post that has no credible source either.
---
Do you pay for your PvE updates? Why does WvW which gets a singular updates maybe once a year have to pay for theirs?
---
Lots of casuals who unable to think critically enough to understand why WvW players are unhappy 
---
Imbagon was good support just like ST rit or a capable healer, ursanway got properly nerfed and perma sin took a few tries but was eventually in the right spot as well. 
---
These examples pale in comparison to chrono and it seems to be a lot harder for anet but chrono is getting closer to a healthy spot as well. You may not like it, but anet can’t do this alone. 
---
The community must find alternatives that work well or better if they truly want more balance. Look at fractals where fb/ren comps are now actually better than chrono comps. Would that have happened without the changes to chrono? Nope. Would it have happened without community theorycrafting and experimentation? Nope again. See, both did something right there. It’s not a magic switch, it’s difficult and delicate. 
---
Bashing won’t help, looking for new possibilities might. So please stop bashing and get off your lazy butt if you want things to change. Remarkably similar to real life, eh?
---
If you don’t understand basic English, otherwise a lot of retardation around, don’t you think?
---
The comments in this thread are pretty much the reason behind while I'll just enter wvw long enough to get the mount, and then jet as quickly as possible.
---
&gt;Im a games developer myself.
---
Wow, you played Game Dev Tycoon too? Samesies!
---
Really the only thing we want is to not have 3 specs that are so completely out of balance that it renders all other classes redundant.  Its really that simple.  
---
At last, not a good but a representation of what most of the herd  thinks
---
Ya, that's why I recommend Kourna. No worry about timers. There are also other places where you can just do whatever happens to be going on at the time. I like Bloodstone Fen since there's usually something to do. 
---
There's also a meta or boss event going on at every time slot, so you can just log in, look at the timer and see what's happening either now or in a few minutes.
---
That's some sweet brainstorming we are having here.
---
I think the problem that some people have is that the content doesn't have any lasting appeal, despite GW2 having steady updates throughout the year with no downtime.  Instanced content is also a big deal for some people. Once they get done with open world/story content there's something else to do before you resort to achievement hunting, and GW2 doesn't satisfy that need. 
---
\&gt;  GW2 also spends a lot more effort on environment, releasing maps with their story 
---
Personally, I wouldn't put much praise towards that aspect, when the new maps use a ton of reused assets and get abandoned (with some exceptions) after a newer release.
---
So while other MMOs have huge downtimes at the end of an expansion's lifespan, the first 8 months of that expansion is packed with long lasting content and fewer but more unique zones. Rather than a dozen new mini zones that all kind of look like recycled assets, very little instanced content, and very little reason to play after a couple of hours per release.
---
Asura Wrath: Limbo.

Yes we get people for what two weeks? And then what? Well look at other situations were something close to it have happen, it took a few weeks then 95% of the are gone because they did not want to put down time and effort not getting enough reward, having to deal with server lags and the poorly ballance were you drown in conditions. It was to much for them. So after those weeks the dediated WvW players will stand were they stand now and nothing have change except that we have a siege mount. 
---
Seriously, its why I try and limit my interactions these days as much as possible. It feels like the devs keep trying to reach out an enjoy their time with the community and the only reactions they get are the most trite praise "OMG I LUV TEH QUAGGUNS" or the most toxic bullshit "Why wasn't X in this release?!?!"
---
I can't imagine how much harassment they get when they show up in-game.
---
Unless anonymous / other companies trolls are trying to polarize the costumer base
---
Anet needs to make clear the position and create an open talk environment.
---
They aren't excited about the vocal part of fans.
---
Yeah, discord or minion master spammage made it so easy to finish stuff. 
---
wow
---
Hey! Do you feel included ? I was talking in a hypothetical state where nobody listen to anybody and just enjoyed calling everybody else toxic because they don’t agree with their own opinions.
---
Shrinking scope and ignoring what used to be core content (basically all pvp modes) just leads to the decline of the game.
---
I mean, the whole thread is basically antagonizing the upset people with no reasonable solution whatsoever.
---
Ya I do want to try Tempest, some of the overloads look fun, but that’ll be when I bored of weirding a flaming sword...which will be a while :P
---
I’m not talking about your stuff, I’m calling out other people which brands toxic other redditor because they don’t agree.
---
If Anet would make clear their position instead saying nothing other companies would not capitalize in their passivity.
---
also extra hitboxes, more skills, more conditions, extra movement, tons of extra gpu work for your pc, tons of extra processing work for the servers
---
When did that even?...  
---
You know what... No... Not going down that road.  
---
&gt; you don’t accept other people cultures.
---
and what is your people's culture?
---
is it based around using "illiterate" as an insult when you can barely function in the language yourself?
---
or is it based around using "retardation" as an insult for people that disagree with you?
---
seems like a pretty shitty culture, feel free to keep it.
---
I'd hate my job if I had to try to appease a hoard of raging dweebs. 
---
I actually consider the extremely long travel time as one of the core issues. I get that there's a balance between "instantly defending the keep" and "not taking forever to get back to the zerg" but I absolutely hate having to run back to the other side of the map when I die. And then I get ganked by roamers, and need to attempt the trek again. A mount will at least cut that annoyance by 10%, which I consider an improvement.
---
&gt;  Instanced content is also a big deal for some people.
---
At some point those people owe it to themselves to ask: "Am I playing the right game?"
---
GW2's treatment of dungeons should have been the hint that instanced content simply is not where they want to be. Fractals and raids feel like lip service, in that light.
---
&gt;  the new maps use a ton of reused assets and get abandoned (with some exceptions) after a newer release
---
But compare with FFXIV, specifically for this example, which releases *only dungeons* and *no open world maps* between expansions. That's all the comparison I was making there, not about the quality of those releases - that's an entirely different commentary.
---
&gt; very little reason to play after a couple of hours per release.
---
Your experience with timegating and content pacing sounds way way way different than mine, honestly, and I'm not sure I'm capable of unpacking that right now.
---
"I dont like when I die" says the person willingly entering a pvp mode where killing other players is one of the main objectives
---
Are you trying to say customer or consumer, I really don't know which one.
---
The real issue was people spamming memes and making toxic threads. It was starting to drown out decent discussion.
---
A lot of people ignore double xp weekends. You need more of an incentive to get people who aren't hard core in that mode to come over. XP isn't enough or people just don't care. People do care about new mounts though because that can be then used outside of said mode. 
---
You went off topic. My point is you as a person should accept other people opinions even if you don’t agree and not to calling out other toxic because you don’t agree.
---
This is in the base you are  doing with me calling out people. 
---
Back to pve where they run from an heart to another heart or from event to event... how is that any different.
---
Customer I’ll fix it. Soon (tm)
---
Good, don’t mention it then. 
---
I don't blame them, both the forums and this reddit are a cancerous garbage fire, it's constant bitching and whining, and to top it off, no one at Anet is competent enough to direct a group of developers. 
---
Didn't know Russian trolls were making their way into video game division too
---
Power reaper is basically as good as it get for necro roaming, unless you're doing some kind of weird core necro stuff. As for sPvP, scourge is obviously the better pick, but in solo games without firebrand support or otherwise, reaper is just as strong and easier to stay alive with 
---
Actually you only need some smart people in the upcoming MMORPGs to create havock In exhausted players.
---
Anet is not helping but this subreddit is becoming something stupid with calling customers toxic.
---
I've had a decent amount of success zerging with Weaver when built semi-tanky. Lots of great AoE, and Fire Staff 4 and Twist of Fate are OP for the constant disengaging you have to do.
---
It is fine, but its mostly a convenience thing. Gliders can't even be used in enemy territory. Judging from the video, warclaws can be used anywhere and can even be used as a seige weapon.
---
Only if mount ends up being faster than 133% MS. Also, passive +25% MS from traits or runes or signets is important in combat too, not just out of combat
---
Yes, I agree this is the perfect example for years to come. Thank you
---
Point proven.
---
and I can't tolerate the insulting and inappropriate words that you have used.
---
We do not use "retardation" that way.   recognise and apologise.
---
The Necro ones are cool, I use [Skull Masque](https://i.imgur.com/joXkSUi.jpg) and [Wraith Masque](https://i.imgur.com/BUk9VeL.jpg)(complete with [Princess Wand](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Princess_Wand_Skin) ofc) for different characters.
---
You know you should not downvote because you simply disagree, right? Just saying...
---
I do see your point, I just think you positioned it very badly by attacking Anet (in the title) for something they have not done.
---
You're also making ad-hominem attacks on ANet for that non-action, and others in comments here, winning you no points.
---
If you want people to stop acting toxic, *you* should not also act toxic, not even for comedic or discursive purposes.
---
The slick pack! Love using it with the gas mask and the asura mount skins. A nice brown, steel and green dye set up to match the pack
---
It's mostly important for out of combat. And they give us something expensive to buy (2g a rune x7), only to have it being outclassed and turning useless a month later?
---
Our difference of opinion can probably be traced to the fact that you and I had very different experiences in 2013. 
---
I spent most of my time trying to get to the tags and getting picked by small groups. Run, get close, die, repeat. The only other alternative was to idle near the waypoint and hope they’d come back so I could join up again. Of course, they’d only come back to vendor/bio/AFK for a few/call it a night, so it was “more waiting” at best and “waste of time” at worst.
---
Also, where were these kind and helpful commanders? I was happy if I was silently tolerated.
---
But it's not about excitement for casuals, it's about excitement for hardcore crowd. Casuals are not commanders, owners of teamspeaks, discords,.... You get more guilds players, you get more commanders and you retain more casuals because there's stuff happening everywhere. 
---
You also don't see any talk of WvW because you aren't in those circles, i am and there is a lot of players that regulary chat on guild/server discords that simply don't play anymore, but would return if there was actually something relevant. 
---
Instead we get mounts which don't excite those players, but excite those PvEers that are going to come to wvw for 2 weeks and than leave, along with some more veterans, like what happens on every silly change they've done. There isn't one discord(that i'm in) that talks about mounts as good change and i'm in like 4 ex guild discords, 1 current guilds and 2 server discords along with whole wvw ones...
---
Why? Do you feel identified with those descriptions? Do you feel attacked?
---
Did you openly help those thread to help to sink the gw2 public image?
---
LMFAO!
---
This is such a perfect description!   &lt;3
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama is not allowed.
---
RIBA or regular run?
---
No doubt. It's a tradeoff. Stretch resources thin and provide a wider spread of content at a lower quality level or cater to the areas that are most likely to keep the game afloat for the longest. It's more about asking where are resources best spent to give the game the most longevity as possible. 
---
&gt; Wat? Users here are calling other users toxic, that's not ANet calling people toxic unless there is something I missed here.
---
Yeah, don't accuse our users of being retarded. Verbal warning for attacking another user. Future attacks will result in temp bans. 
---
I majored in Media and Communications, this isn't unheard of. The thing is that the average citizen doesn't knows of this sort of trick or discards it as "dumb conspiracy theories" when they're not.
---
A few axe skins come to mind:
---
* [Faithful](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Faithful)
---
* [Corrupted Skeggox](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Corrupted_Skeggox)
---
* [Legionnaire Axe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legionnaire_Axe)
---
Bunker chrono, S/D thief, Power Herald - these are your best meta bets right now. All high skill cap though, so you will need a lot of practice to master them (guess you should go S/D thief if you played D/P already).
---
i used neither of those. the reliance on minions wasnt appealing to me.
---
my team consists of: 2 nec/rit healers, 1 ST ritu, 1 panic mes, 1 inep mes, 1 necro/para with i think icy veins, curses and some supportive shouts and last 1 more nec/ele with corpse skills like the degen well, corpse explosion and wars of stability.
---
call the support, use the online form.
---
I have not even said something bad about the mount. It is just sad that noone wanted it but there it is. For many years (check forums) wvw guys ask for specific stuff and nothing happens.  And some randoms come here and call us  weenies. That makes me sure they do not know much about the wvw mode and most likely are new players (under 3 years in GW2). So it is pretty much a compliment and I forgive them their ignorant comments. 
---
That my point, I am not trying to change anybody minds.
---
I just pointed out some points which everybody for some reason attributed to themselves like a personal attacking.
---
I just call out a reddit where they are calling people toxic. Anything else is general guidelines.
---
This subreddit is just taking it out as a personal attack which I find it really strange.
---
ESO is interesting and not unfun, but the combat is so boring I cant stay in the game
---
&gt; Why?
---
because it's toxic.
---
because it's an outdated term.
---
because it's not even the proper form of the word.
---
but mostly because it uses mental health problems as an insult.
---
so, do you even try to be a decent human being or are you just a troll that doesn't care?
---
Huh, TIL
---
He actually has a good point. If the tentacles respawned faster, the boss would be over much faster. With every tentacle death the boss loses a chunk of HP. The fight really starts to drag out and feel boring and uneventful in that little time period after you've killed all the tentacles and before new one spawn, when you're just standing around waiting for more Jade Colossi to spawn.
---
Well, the mount does give you more options on a low population map
---
Yeah they'll develop more WvW mount skins.
---
Or vaettier/broodmother Farm. Those were pretty amazing.
---
Also rushing Dungeons for Platin. Or doing some speedclears.
---
?
---
"The Magic lives in all places, in all things. You can block it, even try to trap it, but the Magic will find its way."
---
&gt; taking it out as a personal attack
---
**BECAUSE YOU ARE PERSONALLY ATTACKING PEOPLE.**
---
You're behaving in a toxic manner, to call out toxicity. That's pants on head stupid.
---
Honestly the crying has gone from kind of funny to embarrassing. Like a child throwing a tantrum in a restaurant because they don't like the food they've been given despite not even trying it.
---
Is this the thing WvW needs the most? No, not really. But the WvW devs probably aren't the one that made it? They might have offered help but the mount devs are the ones who made it. So raging that we're getting this is like complaining that the art team gave us a new loading screen instead of working on Alliance. 
---
I really don't see this as game breaking or destroying. It certainly won't kill WvW. The community will adapt to it. 
---
I *yearn* for steampunk gear on my chronomancer. The panoptic monocle is so good. 
---
I like Mawdrey too; I made a Mawdrey corrupted looking Sylvari before Caithe made it cool 😆
---
relax the thread is being removed. nothign to discuss here, ill be glad to keep the conversation in pms
---
Isn't this some stuff from destiny?
---

---
I shouldn't have to resort to a different game, I am on this sub for a reason, I like guild wars and played gw1 since day 1.
---
I like some social activities but the option to do more solo-able content would be nice. Even if you dungeon with some henchmen.
---
exactly
---
Finding the right WvW guild to run with is so important. WvW sucked for me too until I by chance met a great commander. Asked to join their guild, and it's just people chilling and having fun. 
---
you are using your personal feelings to judge the adjetives, in my culture is the other way around a toxic person is not wanted anywhere, not even in the family. 
---
either way ill be glad to keep this conversation in pm as the thread was removed. 
---
Yes, it also has build templates so it's quite useful tool and very easy to "install".
---
Power scourge or herald
---
Of course one will be the best one. But it would be by a slim margin since the main point is to provide those boons. Static groups can play with whatever they want anyways... but pugs wouldn't have to wait for super specific comps if they had more options.
---
A pug is not gonna care if you run chrono or firebrand if they both provide perma quickness/alacrity. Less waiting for specific needs and more playing the game.
---
If you're going for organized PvE content [snowcrows posts benchmarks](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) of maximum DPS on the training golem. Actual DPS in a raid should be lower then that and will be lower by ~12.5% if in exotic and lower without food/utility. If you're looking for open world DPS that really depends on if you're getting boons from others or having to provide your own. If you're hitting 30-33k in optimal golem DPS, ~15-25k in an actual fight (depending on the boss, can upload your logs to [GW2raidar](https://www.gw2raidar.com/info-help) to see how you match up to others), and really anything over 10k in open world your DPS is fine.
---
Some of the story instances are fucking atrocious tho. Looking at you, HoT.
---
every single situation talking and discussing. Sometimes is not nice, sometimes is messy. important thing is not to convince but to make your points across so the other person can understand.
---
calling playerbase toxic is not nice and i did not like it at all. and the community allowing it in the silence is even worst at my eyes.
---
Oh definitely.  Most of the hardcore crowd hit their breaking point 4 years ago lol.
---
&gt; GW1 w/ heroes
---
even without heroes, you could do some legit solo farm with almost every class.
---
agreed 
---
Great stuff, thanks for sharing.
---
So you may not accept thing you don't like, but others shouldn't?
---
&gt;"oh, you have NO IDEA what we'll do next."
---
They still do this with every episode, they just don't tease what it's going to be. No big deal.
---
EA bad updoots to the left
---
When I see a comment I know well what kind of player has wrote it - someone who knows what he is talking about or just has opinion to share here. 
---
Many like you think that the wvw-players are mad about the mount. When they are actually mad because the things they see as problems are not addressed...but someone is wasting time in Anet for something unimportant  that no one has asked for (even the pve-guests). 
---
Every single person that has played the mode seriously and for a longer period knows that wvw-mode is a low priority.  So you become a non-believer. 
---
Do you remember why we got the Obsidian Sanctum? Do you know who Anet chose to communicate with the wvw-players at the official forums? Or what many players think about the gvg-arenas in the guild hall? When was the last wvw tournament?  How many people are in the wvw-development team? Well ... the answers are not pretty. Even when there was a try by Anet they did it in a wrong way somehow. Maybe if they had 1 employee in a semi or hard core wvw guild it would be a lot different. That is probably too much to ask, even I agree. But it could  have been helpful. 
---
Presumably, you need HoT to use a glider in WvW. 
---
Based on this there are several things I need to optimize more. So really 15 gold sounds very doable. Thank you.
---
It's been a while since I played FFXIV.
---
Not a fan of having specific stat combos tied to a specific map. I'd like to just naturally do an event, do quests, do a dungeon, do a raid, and get the stat combo I need naturally. Rather than doing metas in one map over and over.
---
&gt;unless you love all of it or want to (ugh) collect every piece  (which FFXIV is NOT set up for), then a lot of it is just dead on arrival. 
---
It's the same issue in GW2, right? I've done the story and got my roller beetle. What if I don't want to farm for another backpack or weapon skin? What if I don't want to farm gold for new mount skins? 
---
And I guess if you zoom out far enough from any game you can just ask "What if I don't want to pick fruit?" in a game about picking fruit. Fair enough.
---
And yeah I enjoyed FFXIV, GW2, WoW, TERA, Blade and Soul at different points throughout the years. There are different reasons for me to like each game.
---
I'm keen on computer security, so yeah, I know this is a thing (and worse stuff too). I just don't understand why anyone believes it's even remotely useful.
---
You're literally hiding your garbage underneath the rug. It's going to backfire sooner or later. The problems don't disappear just because people isn't publicly talking about them. In fact, they keep getting worse and worse, and you won't even notice because you silenced your main source of feedback.
---
We could get into deeper discussion about this, and talk about the Streisand Effect, or individual vs group cognitive dissonance. Most people are dumb, yes, but they're not *that dumb*. What you'll eventually get into is a silent death, instead of outbursts of consumer anger (many which are useful if you can handle them properly, and transform them into feedback). This is no different than boasting about subscribers, followers, or likes in social media. They mean absolutely nothing if they aren't actual real customers who spend money on your product or services.
---
In this day and age, there's nothing a consumer values more than truth and sincerity. If you lie, you will get caught, and your little house of cards will crumble, followed by your entire reputation. This whole charade is a pointless gunshot to your own foot.
---
yup, it also depends on the type of material your armor is using. The Flame dye looks ever so slightly different when applied on metal, leather or cloth pieces of armor (regardless of actual armor type).
---
I often use [Vintage silver](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vintage_Silver_Dye) , [Imperial red](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Imperial_Red_Dye), [Golden sheen](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Golden_Sheen_Dye), [Cyanide dye](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cyanide_Dye) and [Deep Glacial sky dye](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deep_Glacial_Sky_Dye) on my heavy and light armor.
---
Sometimes i use some sort of gray or brown dye that looks natural on leather skin parts regardless of armor type. 
---
[The whole funerary weapon set](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Funerary_weapons). The sand snake theme and purple hue is very fitting for any scourge/mirage. The design is so detailed and sleek. 
---
[The focus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Funerary_Focus) has sand flowing down towards the ground with smooth animation. 
---
[The pistol](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Funerary_Pistol) has a spacey futuristic shape, albeit the sand snake theme.
---
It's just a pain to do the legendary bounties collection to unlock the merchant, and then farm them some more for the currency.
---
Assuming you aren't playing a necro, reaper, or ranger, you shouldn't have too much trouble finding a commander to join. There are some who leave their squads as invite only, but theres usually at least one commander who lets anyone join their squad. Even aside from that, nothing is stopping you from running with a particularly snooty commander, you just won't be in their squad.
---
if this is for pve then you'll need a few pieces of trinkets (maybe) for open world, so you can survive better. esp pieces that offer some toughness and more vitality. but your gears and weapons should be offensive. take more tanky gears aren't going to help with the survivability as mobs will always tougher and come in group. it's just a matter of time before they nuke you. 
---
for group contents, you'd always have a healer, so they'd keep you alive. try to switch some utility that give you evades/stability, and watch animations better so you can dodge/evade before you get stunned/attacked. 
---
every class is hard at the beginning, but classes with potentially top dps is traded off with less survivability by default like elementalist. weaver is an offensive spec so it'll make you feel even more squishier. take sometime to play with it. it's a very rewarding spec, imo. but definitely not a cup of tea for everybody. 
---
It'll take the same amount of time to complete, if not more, you'll just have waves of irukandji constantly spawning on top of all the other mechanics. Oh, and the tentacles will have defiance so they can't be blinded or interrupted anymore.
---
Can't wait.
---
Don’t smile, if anet here’s you enjoy part of the game they’ll nerf it to the ground 
---
Then again, WvW gear is a rather loose science. Heard all kinds of shit from hardcore WvW players when it comes to gear, and they act as if one celestial piece more instead of a trailblazer one, for example, would actually make a difference.
---
I would say that's a bit looser, not as much "indicates" but more "slightly suggests".
---
But yeah, again I appreciate that you share knowledge. You seem to be quite knowledgeable when it comes to what I would call "fringe" lore.
---
Almost reminds me of the Borg.  Now I need one.
---
&gt; It's the same issue in GW2, right?
---
I mean the storage system mostly. FFXIV still has retainers, which limits the amount of stuff you can store. Their version of the wardrobe, the "Glamour Dresser" can only store 200 items, that's it. Everything is still character bound rather than account unlock. It's just not a game designed for collect-it-all thinking really.
---
&gt; There are different reasons for me to like each game.
---
I've also played all of those, and couldn't agree more. They each do their thing, and each does some things far better than the others.
---
There is this thing called single player games, might wanna look into that.
---
Beautiful.
---
Gliding was a great improvement.... After months of it being completely and utterly gamebreaking with no communication whatsoever and utterly destroying matchups.  
---
You could fly straigth into towers and flip them, that's how broken it was.
---
Well, better go full tank build so your "Stayin Alive, Stayin Alive"..
---
What pants are those? They spell out "Lions Arch"
---
&gt;Siege Turtles
---
What wvw needs is more siege indeed. Now that less and less people are playing it. 
---
Risen? More like fallen.
---
*High fives self*
---
wow speedy response on here!
---
Just to throw it out there, thanks for generally being around.
---
so what are those ways, except tp flipping (which is not neccessarily as reliable as other ways).
---
raiding for example can net &gt;30g/h if you manage to clear the wings quickly, but thats just once a week.
---
the good thing about sw and istan is that they give a kinda guaranteed and constant gold income. doesnt matter if you do it one day/week, everyday, 2 hours or 10 hours - the g/h ratio will stay roughly the same.
---
I’d argue that at a high level, for example monthly tournaments, weaver is fairly useless. They can do fine in ranked, which is what I think you’re talking about, but man I never like seeing eles on my team. 
---
I don't think it is too hard for casuals, at least not open world and personal story/living world.
---
The OP has an excellent point.  I personally worked in a software development role for almost 8 years.  Customer feedback is really important.  We basically relied on feedback to work out what needed fixing/improving in our software.  When you analyse the types of issues customers report over a given period of time, you can often pinpoint the parts of the code that need redevelopment work (usually an older part of the code).  
---
It is just as important for developers to listen to the customer feedback as it is for customers to provide that feedback.  The biggest mistake I often see with software developers, is that they have a tendency to be very dismissive towards customers.  I used to see it all the time back at my old software development job.  The worst example of this behaviour I can think of were the Adventure Quest developers (Knights of Order).  The way they talked to customers on the official forums would have gotten me fired back at my old software development job.  
---
Another thing worth mentioning is that I reckon ANET doesn’t have a very good release/change management strategy.  Their current strategy seems very reactive whereas you really need to be proactive in software development.  It is much easier to proactively improve something in the Test environment than it is to reactively fix something in the Production environment.  
---
Lastly I think ANET really needs to focus more on technical debt.  Technical Debt is something Project/Release Managers love to ignore.  There are lot of outstanding issues at the moment from the “Colin era” of GW2.  I think these issues are starting to compound and affect the way new features are developed (they work around the issues rather than fix them).  
---
10 minutes is the max I'll do anymore before I go somewhere else. I actually want to play the game, if other people want to listen to The Good, The Bad and the Ugly theme 10 hour version that's on them.
---
agree with what part exactly?
---
that veterans aren't satisfied or that they leave?  or that the game is too hard for casuals? 
---
As someone who plays at least 1 hour a da, it took me 2-3 weeks after release to get myself to do the collection. And I know many more like that, so the data after 1 week doesnt say much.
---
I would not be opposed to this.
---
TLDR: 
---
* core world is easy, and core zhaitan storyline is super easy and actually boring compared to the story the expansions, specially the latest living world season has to offer.
---
* You only really need mounts inside PoF zones, just as you only really need gliding in HoT zones
---
* Some crafting can be leveled super cheaply and will boost your character lvl greatly (i get from lvl 30-38 by spending 2-4 gold and leveling cooking from 1-400).
---
* Unless you plan on doing ascendant gear crafting at lvl 500, crafting isnt worth the gold. But leveling it to 400 will give you a lvl 78 exotic backpack with 2 infusion slots (any crafting discipline does this, including cooking)
---
* Starting out as a mesmer (consider it an advanced class in skill complexity, skill combos and squishiness compared to other professions) is suggested to play from lvl 1, But feel free to try it out in the pvp lobby to see if you like it or not. Whenever you feel confident with any profession you can feel free to boost it and go play any content you wish, even skipping the chronological order of several living world seasons and HoT just to "get to the new stuff"
---
* Note that all story, including living world seasons are connected in a chronological order. While the theme and plot is different, the world and the plot doesnt forget who you are and what you did in HoT and LWS3 when you start your PoF personal storyline 
---
mesmer in general is a bit advanced compared to other professions. Its has more active defenses that relies on you using them than lets say guardians or warriors passive immunity, blocks, passive healing etc.
---
most of the 25 core zones are rather easy to roam around, do tasks, join in on group events and lvl up in. Be sure to keep your weapon up to date on your level so you can deal a good amount of dmg, having an average of lvl 30 gear in a lvl 35 zone is okay.

Doing core story can be nostalgic for you as a returning player, you will get some nice rewards as you lvl up, including a free weekly black lion key. Unless you follow up on the lore and know whats going on around you in the world and in your story, dont expect story telling or story gameplay to be nowhere near as it is currently in the expansions and the latest living world season.
---
A character can use mounts anywhere once you unlock them once,permanently account wide. But you dont really need them outside PoF expansion zones where the terrain is designed for you to use mounts in order to get to "out of reach" rewards. Its similar to how gliding is mostly useful in HoT zones that have out of reach places unless you use gliders on updraft and such.
---
Gearing up as you lvl up is fairly easy, and you can buy super cheap gear from the TP if you absolutely feel like you need to constantly keep your gear at your lvl (tho its not really needed). Check the [gw2crafts.net](https://gw2crafts.net) page and you will see that there are some crafting disciplines that dont take a lot of gold or materials in order to get to lvl 400 (cooking can be done for example for 2-4 gold all the way to lvl 400.
---
Generally speaking, crafting is only really useful if you look at the long run at higher lvls.   
---
While you can simply buy cheap lvl 80 exotics from the TP, or get them from numerous other ways...at lvl 400 you will be able to craft a lvl 78 exotic backpack with infusion slots.
---
At lvl 500 you will be able to craft ascendant materials once per day, which in most cases people craft and sell for a nice small daily profit.
---
At lvl 500 you can also craft ascendant armor and weapons..but those only give you like 5-8% more stats compared to a full exotic gear and are only actually needed if you plan on doing high lvl fractals.

I played gw2 for a year and a half. In that year and a half I spent near 1000$ on gems or account upgrades. That is flat, the most I’ve ever spent on a game. 95% of my time was spent in WvW. I left with a rank of nearly 3k. I have since quit the game due to balance issues and frustration of Anet not listening to feedback on class balance. That is money lost because they wouldn’t listen to the WvW Community. There are plenty of people that I used to play with that spent money on gem store. Some dwarfing what I spent in my time, in a few months. So to suggest that a simple mount will generate money is asinine. Them losing players that were consistent gem store purchasers due to them ignoring our concerns is going to far outweigh anything they would make on mount skins. 
---
To be perfectly honest, them adding this mount before addressing the multitude of concerns that have been around for YEARS, is a slap in the face of the WvW community and shows how out of touch with the WvW community they really are. 
---
I assume people can think for themselves. How defiance bars are now nuked by pressing 1 once.
---
-now www player- getting a new map with the same mechanics compared to adding something which can drastically change the game mode -for better OR WORSE- is completely different
---
mirage-scourge is a bad duo. mirage is a roamer class, your scourge is team fighting. it doesn't synergize well in anyways. so technically if your scourge can't survive on their own, your team is likely to lose team fight and you'll get snowball. something more mobile could be helpful to go with mirage, like thief. so they can +1 and make sure you'd always win team fights. soulbeast-thief is good too for duo. 
---
the only time you'd bring scourge/fb is if the scourge is a very good player. can easily survive without a fb. but a fb gonna make that scourge more deadly and make sure you own that node for the rest of the fight. for higher tier like plat 1 and above, harder to play scourge/fb but doable. 
---
or weaver-something else of choice. weaver is pretty much a bunker now with the crazy sustain. so the other one can join and win team fight, like holo/thief. 
---
it's not only the duo comp that is easy to carry, but it's your own skills too. so play something you guys are both comfy and know your utilities and traits well. i usually change according to enemy team comp rather than just stay dead on 2 classes.
---
No, I don't agree.
---
There's zero logic in what you said here.
---
Yes but you cant use them outside of the race maps, and once you dismount you have to rent again. Or was it after 10 minutes. but anyhow
---
I can imagine it:
---
* Replace the run to the boss with 3 platforms, have a leviathan and a jade elemental mini-bosses on he way to the boss platform. The leviathan would teach you hot to deal with the Maw's tentacles, to dodge the sweeping attacks and such, the jade elemental to deal with the Colossi. 
---
* Then at the boss, instead spawning many Jade Colossi, there would be alternating tentacles and jade colossi in phases that can go much faster if the party is skilled.
---
* The first phase would have just a champion Jade Colossus.
---
  * Whenever the jade colossus' defiance bar breaks and whenever it loses 10% of its health, it will  summon 5 small weak jade elementals.
---
  * These jade elementals are weaker than normal fractal enemies and easy to kill, and when they are killed, they will do a Last Laugh explosion and spawn a reflection crystal. Reflection crystals can be used to gain a special action skill that replaces the old reflection crystal and an effect that works like a one time aegis against the maw's beam. (More on what this skill does ahead). 
---
  * Shortly after the fist wave of small jade elementals spawns, the Jade Maw would start attacking with its beam attack, but instead being a targeted flimsy wiggly line, it would be like the attack it does at the end and in the cinematic, but focused in a pattern instead covering the whole area. This attack can be avoided with invulnerability and moving out of the way, and players who have a shard will survive a hit, but they will lose the shard. 
---
  * When the champion jade colossus is defeated, it runs to a spot by the jade wall under the Jade maw, and 'turn' into "Jade formation". Well, it would actually just die there and the jade formation appears in its place, but a green smoke explosion like those that appear when tentacles spawn would be used to hide the change between the colossus corpse and the jade formation. 
---
      * At T4, the jade colossus would be able to cast Jade Winds on players for massive damage and several stacks of Agony, this can be interrupted by breaking its defiance bar. 
---
      * In challenge mode, the Jade Winds can't be evaded or blocked, only breaking the defiance bar and invulnerability can prevent it. 
---
* The second  phase would have 2 champion tentacles and a second Jade Colossus, this time a weaker veteran version, spreading the player's damage and attention. 
---
  * From now own, whenever a Jade Colossus dies, another spawns in its place. This weaker jade colossus also has a defiance bar, but weaker, and also spawns jade elementals  when its defiance bar breaks or 10% health is lost. 
---
  * The current jade colossus would periodically fixate on a target, giving priority to whoever has been killing more jade colossi and jade elementals. 
---
  * The champion tentacles will each have an ability that will summon many irukandji if they complete the activation. The only way to prevent that will be breaking their defiance bars or killing them. They won't use this ability while their defiance bars are recovering, so it is best to keep all their bars broken or the place will be teeming with irukandji. 
---
  * At T4, If all tentacles manage to complete their summon of irukandji, a champion giant irukandji would also be spawned. This one won't drop any extra rewards, it would only slow the party down. So it may be better to focus on one of the tentacles than spreading between all if your party can't deal with all fast enough. 
---
 * In challenge mode, the defiance bar would have a rougher scaling. 
---
 * Killing each tentacle will take a portion of the Maw's health. After both tentacles are dead, the maw will be left with 50% health. 
---
* In the 3rd phase the a weaker colossus keeps spawning, and several small tentacles appear randomly. These tentacles would cripple allies deal little damage, being mostly a nuisance, but damaging thems won't damage the maw, they'll go invulnerable and hide undeground. 
---
 So, how do we damage the maw now? 
---
 * Reflection crystals will be renamed to Jade Shards. And now Instead giving a bundle when picked and getting a skill when hit by the maw, they give an effect.
---
       * The effect gives an special action skill, replaces the character's back with a Jade Shard back and makes players 1-time immune to the Jade Maw beam (like a specializaed aegis), but the effect and the action skill are lost if a jade maw beam hits you. This back will also be a skin reward for completing the Jade Maw's Challenge Mode.
---
       *  The special action skill is a ground targeted skill that can be used on enemies to deal 50% defiance bar damage (just in case you don't have enough CC to break the tentacle bars), or on the "Jade Formation" to transfer its magic to it. 
---
       * This formation is basically a series of Jade blocks on the jade wall were the Jaw Maw is trapped that will be slowly grow and move up as jade shards are thrown at it. The more shards players throw on it, the larger it gets. 
---
       * When enough jade shards have been thrown into the formation, the current veteran colossus will run to it and explode. No more colossi will spawn, and the jade formation will be finally completed with the missing steps between blocks that will spawn behind the green smoke of the explosion. 
---
   * Players can now climb the jade blocks and fight the Jade Maw directly by attacking its neck, but it will defend itself spawning tentacles horizontally from the wall. The higher the fractal tier, the more would spawn, from 2 at T1 to 8 at T4. It is possible to attack these tentacles, but killing them does little damage to the maw, so they can be ignored if you can can learn to time your dodges to avoid their attacks, and focus on the maw, or they can be killed to be safe but slower.
---
* When the maw's health is finally 0, the jade formation begins to crumble and players must hurry to get off it. It will explode into several Jade Shards are scattered over the platform, and the Jade Maw will do its classic final attack that covers the entire area. Players have to hurry and grab a shard to survive. 
---
Of course, the [Irukandji ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Veteran_Irukandji "Irukandji ")gotta get changed to use the [Rainbow Jellyfish](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Rainbow_Jellyfish "Rainbow Jellyfish") models instead a wind rider mode. They look nothing like [the actual ones](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Irukandji "the actual ones").

Let's hope it eventually happens:

Gee maybe if anet regularly held XP events in WvW we'd not have a playerbase issue. If you think a mount is going to magically fix the declining player base of what's effectively an abandoned game mode (until the patch that redefines a world comes out in 4 years) that's just optimism I even think is silly.
---
The declining mode has come from a lot of things, and, for many, it's just not a fun mode anymore because popular PvE requests just don't pan out in the competitive environment. 
---
Best we'll get is a surplus for the duration of people getting the mount, and, depending on how much it impacts the gameplay, may end up with a worse situation.
---
Depends on how easy it's going to be to force dismount someone. If there's a chance that breakbar of mount charr is not going to be insta destroyed with 3 basi venom hits, there's a chance we'll finally get a goblet filled with gank thieves and mirages squad's tears. 
---
That'd be glorious, though I'm not holding my breath.
---
You're just extrapolating too much from that statement.  I'm not saying the match *belongs* to anyone, but not realizing that a new player's learning playground is also another player's competitive match is very narrow-minded and short-sighted.  My point was to highlight that people who main-play WvW put in a lot of time and effort for the team, and they can feel frustrated when new players don't take the time to learn and thereby trample on or disregard the effort that dedicated players have put in.
---
It's not about the right to be toxic, it's just that it's wrong to be toxic and I believe we both agree that how a person expresses themselves is very, very important when it comes to communicating your expectations for your allies.  Being toxic is not only unproductive but unnecessarily and potentially hurtful.
---
&gt; If you play WvW, you have to live with the fact that others might have different goals then you have. 
---
Absolutely, all goes really are the same goal though - team success. How we do it or which activities that lead to that depend no the individual player.  I don't want to muddy the waters here.  It's more that there is a productive way to communicate and thus work together or a toxic way to divide people.
---
Great counter. Hats off to you.
---
you see yourself as a veteran, but tbh that does not mean that you aren't a casual player.  
---
even playing much does not get you out of the casual branding in gw2.

Follow up post after doing some digging into the matter, and some tips for contacting support for OP and everyone else reading this:
---
1) The ticket definitely isn't deleted, and appears to have been submitted normally. Our agents also replied to it, as they normally would, earlier today, so we're not entirely sure where things are going wrong in this case.
---
2) Make sure to always submit your ticket using the email connected to your game account. If you're contacting us about the game account on myaccount@email.com, don't contact us from myaccount2@email.com.
---
3) Since it seems that we did reply... Double check, triple check, that our replies aren't going into your spam folder, and maybe add our support site email to your contacts!
---
True. 
---
But told this way: It makes me want to avoid WvW. I'm noob, not stupid or five years old. ;-)
---
Your advices are not really advices because it's easy to know these things only with roaming. Maybe you could welcome new players in WvW in a more friendly way. 
---
...and casuals too.
---
What's the best and/or easiest way (method or profession) to unlock bloodstone bricks? Like should I farm for gold to just buy my way to 400 or is there a decent way to farm materials directly? Have a grow lamp and light source, need the bricks for the backpack thing.
---
I'll edit in a few minutes with my profession levels for which is closest. 
---
As in "more difficult to kill unsuspecting victim"?
---
You can't mount in combat anyway. 
---
I mean, as long as you aren't doing anything to provoke them, ya, reporting them is a good choice.
---
"First I was afraid, I was petrified..."
---
You're the proof i'm right. Cantha confirmed. XD 
---
Especially since it isn't just adding new players. My guild already struggles to make sure we get everyone on map, but now we're going to throw in a bunch of players gridinding their mounts? People that have loved and committed time to playing WvW are going to get blocked off map sitting in queues so a bunch of people can come get their shiny new toy.
---
I might have missed it, but I didn't see all the bird memes and complaints with the fractal update get quarantined to one topic.
---
&gt; they are really mad because i jump on there bodies in wvw
---
Big think.
---
I know right! Super surprised by it been helpful so far
