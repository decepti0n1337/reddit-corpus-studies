I think you should add in your ticket all evidence you can get. Add your public api key so they can check for themselves in gw2 efficiency. Explain them what is gw2efficiency and how to check the achievements and items,xD. After they have this, they can't tell they  can't check if you have or not the infusion. So, they only have to choose if they want to help you or not.
---

---
 Remember that for a company the most important is to avoid bad publicity. If you try your best and they have the means to help you then, it is better for them to help you than receiving bad publicity.
---
---
---
CC should have diminishing returns in pvp.
---
If it's from employees, it's not speculation.
---
I spent thousands of dollars in game usually I will stop playing as I'm just wasting my money but then I get bored re instal and end up wasting more of my money and feeling terrible. 
---
Late HoT and path of fire is when i really started to lose control of my spending.
---
So, did some testing. GW2 Efficiency cannot track infusions that have been slotted in an item, either that or their search is ignoring them. Now when I look at the item through GW2 Efficiency I can see the infusion on the item I added it to. 
---
What I think is happening is when you slot an infusion in the game it ceases to be an item and rather becomes part of the properties of the item you slotted it into. The when the item is deleted the logs only store the item that was deleted not all of it's properties so there is no way of searching to see if it was deleted. 
---
Either that or they do not have a tool that can readily find an item based off of it having a certain property so they would manually have to go through the player's entire account inventory searching for the infusion or everything they had deleted to confirm that it was not on their account.
---
Ah ty didn't know this!
---
I know its *much* easier to design weapons but the lack of armor rewards is really depressing. We get so many weapon skins nonstop but armor? We might get a new set every 3-4 months if we're lucky.
---
So you're saying there's a chance? :D Time to start hoarding statuettes.
---
With that charr right behind her I thought they'd added in a fluffy tail cosmetic hahah. (please don't)
---
This is probably the most lovely thing I've ever heard.
---
Lmao, who pays for 150 raid kills? How much would that even cost?
---
The warclaw was an entirely different situation. It's a WvW mount and has no overlap with PvE mounts so it makes sense for it to be completely separate. I think the only reason they added this Skyscale pack was because there won't be another mount select license pack for a couple months and they wanted to add some options (and catch up on the number of skins) in the meantime. You're right that there's no guarantee, but it seems likely to happen.
---
It does, however, have a biased sample.  
---
But it's the best we have.
---
I did an experiment. It took me less than 1 minute to make a screenshot that mad it look like GW2 Efficiency was saying I did not have any salvage kits anywhere on my account using nothing other than windows paint.  
---

---
As to your second question. Given Dornsinger's comment, I believe this is not as edge case a you believe and that there was serious community outcry when such a an event took pace.  
---
&gt; This was in the past heavily abused by some players when they contacted us, stating they lost the Moto Infusion - when they had not. We granted some users several of them as a result (and there's still the reddit thread about that fact somewhere around here).
---
The bottom left channel is really hard to make use of. Completely imperceptible with a lot of combinations.
---
Been playing a few months now and I am more intimidated by raids and Fractals in GW2 than I've been in any other MMO I've played. Haven't even investigated how to do dungeons let alone the raids.
---
Historical economics tells us there's more profit the other way.
---
Consumer choice leads to less profit. There's no way to make profit and consumer comfort compatible, we can only encourage society to value mental happiness as much as profit.
---
GW2 has such bad optimization which makes this very unlikely to even attempt. The entire engine is just modified from GW1
---
Yeah it sucks, but ICM still works.
---
They added a new aura that can only be obtained with combo fields quite recently. Also combo fields are still important in wvw/PvP parts of the game, so it would be good to also teach them.
---
id actually like to do story first you have somewhere where i can a catchup on everything up until pof?I started playing around s2 and left gw2 until i got a better pc(so i dont have anything from hot).
---
So, basically the flat earthers of Tyria.
---
And by making comments claiming that they could be worse, its normalizes their practices now.
---
While the Commanders fan club fights them.
---
True I have also checked it and works fine. It doens't matter if the infusion is inside or out of an item, you can always write the name and it appears.
---
Not everyone has the same legendary...
---
There are many, each requiring a lot of time to acquire. That's why they flex. That's why it's okay.
---
Same here...
---
Get the elite specializations, even if you not going to play some of the class.
---
The rule is to make those who want to contribute content also contribute to the subreddit in comments and discussion. Part of the reason why you were downvoted and then reported is that this community wanted that rule and as moderators we enforce it. All of your submissions have been links to your own content and comments on your own content so that violates the 80/20 rule.
---
Unlock your elite spec (do hero challenges on the expansion maps, you can also use skill points from core maps but they are worth 1/10th of expansion maps). The elite spec is usually a powerful upgrade on your core mechanics and offers new gameplay to each profession.
---
Aside from that, you should level up masteries. In PoF that means unlocking and upgrading mounts - simply play through the Path of Fire maps and story, explore the maps etc.
---
If you are asking specifically about Season 4, just do it in order of release. Save up the map currencies if you want a skyscale mount.
---
im working on that rn but i havent started the story so i didnt know that pof masteries give more.i got the skills il wait to max it out
---
Well for one don't just frolick after his ass :/
---
Is this your work?
---
They're not EA. At least they don't lock bits of the game behind "surprise mechanics" or game progression behind them, either (NFS Payback without mods).
---
Thank you for the build and all the info.
---
I have never used GS + Axe w/ Warhorn.  What's the best way to go about doing everything in a fight with that combo and build?
---
Sorry for the dumb questions it's been years since I played so I have forgotten a lot.
---
Why is it when I encounter an invisible wall I just go around but when someone else does it they complain they can't leave the map to explore with guaranteed no reward?
---
Replace charr race with pussy juice and you got yourself a perfect label for a bottle of rum    :D
---
I suspect the biggest problem for me will be time-zones.  I'm on an NA server but I do not live in NA.  Generally speaking not a lot of people on when it's my evening, WvW it's not completely dead but it might as well be.  It starts to get active around 1-2am my time. 
---
Which translates into around the same time when PVE is most active with groups.  Weekends people tend to be on but my evening during the week?  Sometimes the meta fails because there's just not enough people on the map to do it.  It is what it is. I joined the NA server because I had family who was already playing and they live in NA.   They got interested in other games and moved on, I stayed.  They sometimes come back and play for a bit then fade out again.
---
I didn't get into raiding nor into high end fractals because I didn't find people I felt comfortable going through the content with.  However, if there's someone easy going etc, then yeah I'd be interested in trying again.  
---
Lol, I totally understand that your gear is important but if you have the correct gear and don't know the correct rotation your gear will not help and you'll likely be dead or driving whomever it is in charge of healing you nuts.  I tend to play supportive not DPS classes.
---
Get the mounts, they're fun, thats it kinda

Is there any better way than sending ticket to get attention from someone in Anet with regards to PVE dynamic event bugs?
---
Hi all! I'm currently running a tempest [Condi might bot](https://youtu.be/hzEUxTyZEOs) in open world and I'm thinking of gearing it to be a heal slave for raids and t4s. Am I gimping myself in terms of wantability in raids or t4s as compared to... say if I went with an alicragade?
---
fidelity should not be tied to the wallet.. detail maybe, but texture res? thats a joke
---
Totally get that. Anet is a business and needs to make money. However, they could make more money if they didn't force people to buy the whole pack for 2k gems. They're missing out on a lot of sales, when many would only want 1 or 2 skins. That means 2k gems for 1 skin, or 1,000 gems each for 2 skins that people like. A lot of people will just make do with the default one because of that. If Anet offered individual skins for, say, 500 gems each, so buying the whole pack saves you 500 gems, but allows people to buy individual skins at a slightly higher gem price, I believe they'd make more sales.
---
Excellent sleuthing, seems possible! :D
---
It's called addiction because it's something you usually can't leave or accept you have without outer help, they distort emotions and perceptions, it's not as easy as "just quitting".
---
Do Tequel every day and gets hoards of karma
---
Soon you will overflow with it seriously!
---
Flame and frost 2: we need more signposts
---
You there, you look useful.
---
Actually got pof with a discount.will do the same for hot when one comes up.it will be less than the bundle.
---
Meh. Looking at this, I think I'm actually just going to boycott the GW2 cash shop instead of kissing them for it.
---
And why in god's name are they charging 2000 gems for this? So you spend an extra $10 for 800 ggems after the $20 spent on 1600 gems? So you always have 400 gems left over and feel tempted to buy more and more and more and more?
---
Jim Sterling made me realize GW2 is extremely to predatory with its limited time sales and loot boxes.
---
Go away, gemstore mount skins. 
---
Maybe stop handicapping the base mount skins with only one dye channels instead.
---
It still is meaningful though. Because you could argue that the playerbase that comes online and plays the game for 2 days a year are somewhat "outside" of the community.
---
So while GW2 Efficiency statistics miss out on the new players, it actually helps guide the statistics toward active players, your real competition and your real companions out in Tyria.
---
Ouchie no love for engineers
---
&gt;Any idea how to beat him?
---
1. Get the 15 people to waypoint instead of laying there waiting for a rez so the executioner will scale down.
---
2. Learn [their patterns](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_Bandit_Executioner) so you won't suicide your thief while spamming Unload when they block, just for example.
---
3. Have non-heavy-hitter players kill their adds ASAP.
---
I think this would be a better thing for Commanders and Mentors to be leading than runs through Verdant Brink IMO. Teach lowbies the importance of break bars, boss mechanics, and filling the roles your profession is best at in a group event like this.
---
Explaining the stats will also be great, many people don't understand how precision, ferocity, expertise, concentration work from just the game itself.
---
Canceling games in development happens all the time in the videogame industry, so I don't know why you seem shocked about it because that's how things are. 
---
Also, no, gw2 won't keep anet on bussiness forever and they better come up with something good next time cause daddy ncsoft won't be willing to finance many more failed projects.
---
It did not receive a sale during the anniversary last year. Only Path of Fire, and the Path of Fire + Heart of Thorns combo.
---
I'm not trying to discourage you, just setting realistic expectations. HoT doesn't go on sale. You'll have to buy it full price unless you can catch it for cheaper at Dlgamer. You are basically required to purchase it to have the whole game, and my suggestion is to hold off on Path of Fire until after you own and have completed HoT, but you are free to disregard that.
---
I like that they have a direct purchase option. I always make sure to go for that one.
---
Can someone explain? Ive made the mistake by sorting through 'new.'
---
Dude, get over it.  Even if you don’t like the beer example, I’m sure you can think of tons of variety packs of products that do the same thing as the mount pack.  
---
All advertisement and capitalism works by appealing to psychological tendencies people have.  That doesn’t mean you’re getting “preyed” on anymore than anywhere else in the world where you shop for something.
---
At this point though, I’m fucking done.  You really wanna play the victim card for some optional item in a video game that doesn’t even require real money to be spent.  Sadly for you, video games aren’t developed and maintained for free.
---
why is it predatory? its not rng, you spend money you get what you pay for. they dont make you open rng loot boxes to get the mount skins.
---
This is a screenshot of a quest in World of Warcraft. "There's something in the water" is a very popular meme from GW2 referring to the quaggan who yells this every time Tequatl spawns.
---
LOL I was the guy in the chat! Telling people to go kill the Champ Fleshreaver in Timberline Falls for the champ bag while waiting for leyline anomaly to pop.   
---
It's the only champ bag in PVE that drops Razah's Nightmare \[which sells for \~50g\] Link  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Razah%27s\_Nightmare](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Razah%27s_Nightmare)   
---
The only difference is, in my country, at xx:20, there's no one there to kill the anomaly, much less the Champ Fleshreaver. But in your country, at xx:20, you have tons of people there sitting idly passing up a chance at 50g!
---
&gt; Also I'm pretty sure that Elder Dragons can only absorb unbound magic. Zhaitan doesn't have magic from all 6 gods because that magic is bound to the gods. It's the same reason why they can't absorb an elementalist's spells and suddenly gain elemental power.
---
They consume magic of those they corrupt. It's part of the corruption process, as explained in the asura and Whispers storylines dealing with Professor Gorr.
---
Zhaitan got magic from various Orrian artifacts on top of the Orrian priests, who in turn had magic flavored towards their respective gods. He corrupted all six temples and had ransacked the magical vaults of Arah that the Six Gods had built up with their own and other forms of magic.
---
On top of that unbound magic is still a "type" of magic, just as ley-lines are still (all) type(s) of magic. Unbound death magic is still death magic, and unbound fire magic is still fire magic. It's just not bound to a specific person, place, or thing.
---
Got HoT for half off in May. They did PoF for a week then HoT then the bundle. Only needed HoT since I got PoF key during Alienware Arena giveaway.
---
yup.with the discount i got pof for 10 euros less so if i buy hot full it will be same price has the bundle. if it does not have a sale on the birthday of the game il just buy it full price.
---
Ok sir. ArenaNet are approximately up by 3.5% in Sales from Q4'18 to Q1'19. 
---
YOY - The company is down by 30.9% (Q1'18 vs Q1'19) in Sales.
---
If you really cared you could've worked this out.
---
play this on my own holo fairly often, the one thing I can recommend is get an MMO mouse with lots of buttons cause you've got a ton of stuff to hit
---
The Legendary Bandit Executioner was introduced as part of a side-story event during Living World Season 3. They may appear after specific Champion bandits have been defeated while at least one player character has a Death Mark in their inventory. In general, Executioners are meant to be extremely difficult, even for geared-out level 80s.
---
I'm assuming you mean the bottom left  dye channel on the Bioluminescent one? Yeah, that one looks to be suited for high contrast at the moment.
---
&gt;Now, remember there are pay to win elements in GW2 as well. Bank slots (default bank is very limited) and stash size, unlimited harvesting tools, to name some. Not as shameless as other games, but they still on the long run give a noticeable advantage to those who pay.
---
These are convenience items that do not make your character stronger. You have no idea what p2w means.
---
Yes
---
Spooky, here I typed this (and even said food for thought in it);
---
&gt;It's really interesting food for thought given the layoffs and NCSoft's push for ANet to focus on GW2 development.
---
&gt;In relation to these figures, I don't know if this quarter's sales are (as of yet) going to be reflective of the effects of the layoffs. Like in terms of development at least, the content that's went out has realistically been stuff that was being worked on well before that all happened. So, here some time later after Season 5 gets rolling (probably a couple episodes in at least) and the fallout from the layoffs starts feeling more apparent, it's going to be very interesting to see what impact that could have on the earnings and possibly what other ways NCSoft might try and push to boost their revenue.
---
Then before I posted, I refresh the page just to make sure you didn't edit in some like correction information or something, and you edited in basically what I was going to say. 
---
Read my mind. xD
---
Honestly, no. I haven't tried it lately. I played it all through Heart of Thorns, and, honestly, I loved it. Going back to Scrapper, now, seems like a step backwards somehow. Maybe that's my own psychological hangup. I dunno... I guess it's enjoying some replayability due to recent "balance changes," right?
---
Holo is good in pvp
---
Don't spread rumors.
---
"Leveling a crafting discipline to 500 is equivalent to gaining 10 levels, while leveling to 400 gains approximately 7 levels"
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crafting
---
I've also done this 5 times for levels. 0-400 is 7 levels
---
1. Fractals can pre-stack boons and shouldn't have any issues stacking might/fury in a normal setup (which is a lot of what boon tempest does).
---
2. There are many better healing options for fractals, mainly in the case of druid, firebrand, or renegade
---
3. Lots of good fractal groups run low or no healing though this is more of a thing in statics/CMs and not pugs
---
So to sum up, condi is not great in fractals, there are better healing options, groups prioritize damage and heal tempest doesn't bring much. So yes I think you would be better off gearing a heal firebrand/renegade if you want healer or just power alacregade if you have that close to set up.
---
Npc only outfit. The closest to that dress side cut would probably be order of whispers light female gear.
---
Well then they've changed it. Because I specifically remember leveling characters with crafting, and it gave 10 levels. But that was back when 400 was the max. I've done it so many times back but never since it has been upgraded, since now we have much easier ways to level-up.
---
Hey! That's me! Damn Dragon Cultist's, they go from one superstitious belief to another!
---
Personally I don't think gw3 is even close to necessary yet but developers do seem to love developing.
---
It does seem a bit harsh. I think a reasonable expectation is you rep your guild when you do a guild run (duh-- if you don't rep there why even bother?) and we remind everyone to do such a thing when it's going on. 
---
Kicking people willy nilly for not repping the guild on alts is nonsensical. I won't even talk about 100% rep/you can't rep another guild at all, because that just sounds like the psycho possessive type that I would not associate with. 
---
Granted, people can run the guild any way they want, even if it is nonsensical.
---
Wow! That's quality armor!
---
Why do you refer to yourself in the third person
---
So a basic rotation would be something like Locust Swarm &gt; Weapon swap &gt; Well of Suffering &gt; Nightfall &gt; Grasping Darkness &gt; Reapershroud &gt; Death Spiral &gt; 5 - 8 reapershroud auto attacks &gt; out of Reapershroud and swap to Axe &gt; Ghastly Claws &gt; Axe auto until Ghastly Claws is off CD &gt; Ghastly Claws, Locust Swarm &gt; Weapon swap &gt; repeat.
---
If you want a full rotation, check out snowcrow's guide.
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/reaper/power/
---
Yeah, that's what I'm playing, now. It's not *bad*; it's just not as good as I would like for it to be. I don't expect to be able to just dominate every fight. I'm not a ***mesmer*** or a ***ranger***, after all. It would just be nice to be a little more competitive--especially in teamfights.
---
man, and I was looking forward to another branded skin since I have the branded mounts pack :/ at this point I may as well have just bought shimmerwing...
---
Anet really should make season 5 a f2p season. They have nothing to lose and everything to gain. System is the same, once the episode is over after 3 months or whatever it’s in the gemstore but please just let absolutely everyone play the season.
---
I can play classic RuneScape through an app via my phone.... make pvp like this!
---
Schoolgirl and boy outfits would save this game and the company.  The assets are already in game, they just need to release it, and everyone's wallet will open and pour forth profits.
---
Mesmers don’t dominate in every fight. And holosmith is pretty good right now. Maybe try a new build.
---
There is no gambling in this pack. You get all of them.
---
Level 8. My speculation is that you change weapon. Would you mind elaborate what class you are and where did you actually get the regeneration boon, if you remember.
---
**Food for Thought:** PoF had 7% higher sales than HoT. 141750 mn KRW in 4Q15-2Q17 vs 151548 mn KRW in 3Q17-1Q19.
---
I adore the Shimmerwing.  The quality and resolution is high and the dyes let me really create a mount that feels 'legendary' which is what was promoted as the reason for the process needed to earn it.  The dragonfly wings are gorgeous and the dye channels make sense.  It's a work of art.  These new skins, unfortunately, they feel very low quality with poor resolution to me.  I'm not even a little interested in any of them.  Hopefully there will be more variation down the line.
---
I don't think it's poor support. Sequence of events is this:
---
Your account used language that's not acceptable Ban.
---
You contact support and say, look it wasn't me, my nephews were playing on the account, which is also against the TOS.
---
I'm not saying it's right he increased the ban, but if you're going to contact the authorities, it's probably better not to tell them you've committed other crimes.
---
Worst that can happen is you escalate the ticket, explain the account was used without your consent by kids who were visiting and hope for the best.
---
I played holo for the first time ever in pvp and won 10 unranked matches in a row. Forge 5 out of stealth is a bitch.
---
Knowing my luck they will just double it again smh. I appreciate the feedback. I don’t think people understand  I’m not letting others use my account, they got on their uncles(me) computer and got on. Should of had something to stop that but never viewed it as a concern. Safe to say the little shits won’t be able to get on it in the future.
---
Raids give karma now
---
And the rewards scale with karma buffs 
---
Pretty easy 300k+ karma per week
---
Please *do*

*\*sadly gazes at empty bank account\**
---
The Room is one of those "So-Bad-Its-Good" movies that is HILARIOUS. Ya'll are salty.
---
Personally I like to run sword n board holosmith with just the one kit, grenades, with which I'm spamming 1 while my forge cools down.
---
My other utilities are the healing turret, spectrum shield, laser disk, and prime light beam.
---
If you're having trouble surviving, hard light arena is helpful to replace laser disk as it offers a pull (to give you a breather) and like 15 sec of regen and protection, or utility goggles can give you a second stun break if things really get tough
---
How many classes actually have cc abilities at low levels?
---
just an idea, make sure you are not running off an  integrated graphics card if i has one
---
In my institution's budget meeting last week, the head cheese presented figures with "salaries" and "wages" (for hourly employees) separate from "operating expenses." I don't know how others do it, but that's one case where salaries weren't included in operating expenses.
---
Assuming you're speaking of PvE. It is indeed really viable, with an great DPS and an easier rotation than the rifle meta build. 
---
Someone posted a video of the build few weeks ago :
---
https://youtu.be/OP7Q-TwATX4
---
😻 lovely shot Kitty!
---
The LS model is really killing this game and unless they drop it they won't be doing business for much longer.
---
Yeah, because we need that kind of rage while holding a small, fragile, and expensive electronic device.
---
I wish I could get into FFXIV like a lot of people seem to.  I literally fell asleep playing it, and it was like 9pm.  I cannot imagine getting very into a game with that boring of combat.
---
Actually, it could get complicated when you consider that while the base game is F2P, all current Living Story chapters require the latest expansion to play. Logging in during the release window will unlock it for free, but it can't be played until the expansion is added to the account.
---
So it probably isn't feasible to do this for technical reasons.
---
&gt;You just don't enjoy difficult content
---
You made that up, read again.
---
&gt;you don't want other people to have it because you don't like it.
---
&gt; I played that game a lot, but I only got into doing the higher end stuff towards the end because I wanted the HoM statues. 
---
Then you suck. And if you had not at least some of the statues you, for sure, did not play a lot. 
---
Ressources were available, I asume you never read any forums?
---
Why should we as a community talk about it? Its up to anet to develop the game and I highly doubt MOB is trawling reddit for ideas.
---
please yes
---
Criticisms is harsh. I was trying to point out pitfalls in interpreting the numbers as posted.
---
I know next to nothing about coding, but it sounds like the game does a check if the user owns an expansion before allowing the content to be started. Thus, for a free LS season, the check should simply always come back as positive.
---
More importantly though, if something like this would stop them from implementing such an addition (that is, if they decided it was a good idea and this check made them rethink the whole idea) they are fucking morons. I can understand not implementing something like this because their info does not justify it, but if their info would justify it, and then they wouldn't implement it because of a poorly coded check ... that would be moronic.
---
All of this feels like LoL forums "pls unban me" - posts have started to leak. "it wasn't me, it was someone else on my account! Oh and btw I buy (insert cash shop currency) so unban or I don't buy anymore" is like a blueprint for an excuse post.
---
Man I'm so far the opposite it hurts. I went back for Shadowbringers (played Heavensward upto finishing Alexander, skipped Stormblood) and really wish I didn't. The glamour system is a pita compared to wardrobe, the entire inventory / retainer system is a god damn mess. There's tons of random material drops but checking market prices or selling them is all a huge pain. All non-dungeon content is HP meat sponges that don't threaten the player in any way but take forever to kill, the amount of talk to NPC &gt; walk 2 feet &gt; talk to NPC &gt; walk 4 feet &gt; talk to NPC &gt; run for a few minutes to go kill a literal single random enemy &gt; go talk more in the main story quests is insane. Losing buttons due to downlevel when doing roulettes also feels absolutely awful.
---
If you don't find a single new feature in GW2 since 2013, you're a hopeless case and are better off playing FFXIV.
---
I'm pretty sure that wouldn't fly for anything publicly listed. Unless the entity can operate without paying salaries.
---
Oh God please no. No korean dress-up bullshit. It's already bad enough as it is.
---
PoF related revenue was driven by mount skins
---
We literally get a new map every three months with fucktons of content. What...I...how...
---
Are you looking for blobbing? Guild raids? Servers are different
---
Free means no cash for anet.
---
Agreed. I never said useless, just misleading. Having said that, if I could just have one I would usually take the corresponding quarter from a year ago over the previous quarter.
---
"No real new features since 2013"
---
If you dont count
---
Raids
---
Gliding
---
The structure of most metas 
---
Mounts
---
Most of the fractals
---
Elite specs
---
Ascended gear
---
Most content worth doing.
---
Now, are all of these features good? Up to you, I think they are. But if you wanna sit there and say that no new content was added post 2013, you're a liar.
---
And even content that isnt """"new"""" is still fun. Dragonfall is the perfect example of this. It's a meta but done in a new and fun way.
---
Blobbing mostly, but if there is guild raiding this time that would be awesome!
---
RoF was linked to deso in previous link and it is dead too for weekdays (my time) only Flangor was leading on holidays but not the last week so deso not an option for me.
---
np :)
---
Yeah where's this fr\*ckin dude's piano gat dang h*ck
---
But they had no output over before the refocus either.
---
All those people on internal projects? Did they produce revenue? If not, did they produce loss leader products able to produce revenue later?
---
Or was money thrown via bad projects, which in turn meant GW2 had to actually produce more income than the dev team working on it needed?
---
Personally, I stopped playing gw2 because I have stuff to do in real life and I didn't quite like the gameplay (collections, skyscale, focus on easier, grindier stuff) anymore. But I still really love and care for the game (and its devs, even though I have a lot of critique I do criticise. I do criticise because I care so much). I'm with you, with gw2, anet isn't as immoral as other companies, the gem store is by far not as exploitative as other practices and loot boxes. At the moment, they aren't our friends - but contrary to others I wouldn't say they are our "enemies" either.
---
I am still not a fan. I shared for raising awareness that issues *do* in fact exist, and I am happy and surprised so many people understand. So thanks for sharing, too. :)
---
Hi 'play (collections, skyscale, focus on easier, grindier stuff) anymore', im DAD.
---
I will never understand why people waste their time on a game whose content releases they neither enjoy nor play.
---
LS are tied to specific expansions: the HoT LS was tied to HoT, the PoF one is tied to PoF. Creating a new season of LS that is tied to something else (like the core game, thus allowing it to be played by the F2P players) or tying it to nothing, isn't a an exception ... It should simply be a new rule that gets added to the current rules.
---
As I have said, if this idea would tick all other boxes and would thus be something that they could see as a worthwhile addition to the game, but would be stopped because of the "LS are tied to expansions" rule ... that would mean we are dealing with some massively moronic coding.
---
Oof :/
---
Can't be weirder than getting the Witcher to run on the Switch I'd imagine...
---
turn character limit to low. thank me later.
---
current conversion just over 3800g.. yikes!
---
Doesn't it take a while for bans to catch up to you? Is it possible this ban was from another time?
---
Did YOU read what you wrote? Shitty map you play for two hours and never go back is NOT something someone says about anything he enjoys, let alone genuinely spends time with.
---
...you're not one of those weird people who hang around subreddits of games they hate just to hate on the game, are you?
---
Q1 would have included all the payout deals that probably ate into their profit.
---
To complement the other reply about raids:
---
* If you are in a static then it is a very viable classe to play that can accommodate various comps
---
* If you intend to pug I would not recommend it as you will usually have 1 heal Druid and the might stacking you are providing will usually end up being wasted or wasting the Druid's might (so in any case it's net loss of role compression for a very limited certainty increase that you will have 25 might)
---
While it can definitively be fun to play I would also recommend gearing an Renegade either with a healing build (mostly Harrier and maybe a bit of Minstrel in Fractals if you have the potions) or with the Diviner build. In the long run you may appreciate to have both but I think the best bet right is probably the heal Renegade because regular pug T4 groups will usually need a dedicated healer and Renegade is better for this (and the overall DPS) than the Firebrand.
---
Are you sure? If you can just have GW2 run in wine on linux, I'm pretty sure you can just run GW2 in X on whatever Y the Switch uses as an OS. No spagetthi code voodoo needed.
---
How much should that cost upfront and how many can we buy from a home instance node? Im not sold on this one because they primary way people get the envelops is from the daily 16+guild hall. Sure there is dragon bash but these things arnt used for collections ap or anything other than opening for gold or selling on the tp for gold.
---
I wasn't really serious about that. I was mostly trying to point out that dragon bash isn't the only holiday without a home instance node because of anet's consistent inconsistency
---
Meanwhile, I'm here playing gimmick builds every game in an attempt to make Berserker playable in the slightest.
---
 Underworld or Farshirverpeaks 
---
Hard choice here((
---
Don't want to transfer again after link is over
---
FSP seems to have more active commanders, also fsp has community raids, but the current link they have atm is a beast.
---
So just use skyscale?
---
[removed]
---
I didn't have one of those either. I am a surgeon with my raptor.
---
Hi 'a surgeon with my raptor.', im DAD.
---
I know you're trying to defend it, as you should be, but *you* need to be real. Lets break down everything you said, shall we?
---
* Yes we get a new map, but the majority of them don't have meaningful repeatable content. The newest maps have done better in that aspect but what about all the others? How dead are the other LS maps?
---
* New Skins and collections - Yeah these are nice but its not repeatable content, which the game desperately needs. This is content you do once and when done you never go back to the zone unless you're farming something.
---
* Fully voiced content that is free - This is one of the best aspects of GW2 but as I said in my original content I think the bulk of the patch being LS is hindering the game. When they spend the majority of their time on the story and everything that goes into that we miss out on other things they could've added. 
---
I know you're in shock for some reason but you have all these other MMOs doing what GW2 does and more. GW2 has glaring flaws that I want to see fixed. I love this game and it has limitless potential and I wish Anet could realize that.
---
Mordremoth : submit to modre-
---
Nuclear launching sirens 
---
Mordremoth : oh shit!!
---
There are also fine quality Divine Envelopes, the mailbox wouldn't need to give us rare and heavily limited Lucky ones. It's still not really needed imo.
---
You only get two hours of content out of the new maps if you blast through the story and do nothing else. You literally do not play the content besides a tiny fraction of it, and do so on maps you think the worst of.
---
Full stop here.
---
&gt; Why should we as a community talk about it?
---
I mean you ask why then you talk to yourself and you bring up exactly why we need to. The game is obviously in a decline and we need to ask what can Anet do differently that will draw in/retain players. The LS is amazing but its not giving the game what it needs.
---
the story is free and entertaining enough to do once. thats what a lot of people come back for. The mediocre maps not so much. basically all the things they keep adding are just fluff that wont really enhance the quality of the game.
---
Get the mounts and a set of harrier's for a heal build
---
That's sadly all PoF delivers
---
Damn you beat me to it
---
Sure let's all switch and buy consoles.
---
Yeah no fuck off. 
---
If Anet release a console game, there's 100% chance I'll never play it.
---
oh, well I toss it up to need/use for a home node. Like Lunar new year I think makes sense for not having a home node, to me at least. Im not put out about not having a home node for either.
---
&gt;I know you guys like the game but its important to talk about why the game is doing badly.
---
But the game ISN'T doing badly. That is the thing. People love being all doom and gloom as soon as these reports come in, but in reality the game, while it might be doing a bit worse than before, but that doesn't have to mean it is doing badly. It still has a very solid revenue, especially for a 7 year old game.
---
Multi core!? It clearly uses just one to 100%!
---
They should but since it’s a “play how you want” type of experience I doubt it will be implemented. There is a huge benefit to that system no doubt about it but let’s be real.
---
Populations is good, revenue is bad. It is edging close to Aion levels and they ahve much higher operating costs. Anet maybe aren't in trouble, it is impossible to know as we don't have all thet much information, but it isn't great.
---
Gotta liberate those jotuns tho
---
Sounds great! Just the kind of stories im looking for.
---
Tnx for sharing :)
---
I also got the game 2months after release.
---
I had a few breaks mainly due to work but i could consider my self as an old active vet still.
---
Dont say that ! ._.
---
Cool as it is I doubt it has anything to do with GW2
---
Because asuran technology is somewhat re-mark-able.
---
There's already more than enough throwbacks like the entirety of PoF. I'd much rather see something new.
---
No I'm saying its disingenuous
---
I still prefer the Stormchaser, but the Starbound is a very close second. And I only like the Stormchaser more because I main ele, so... theme.
---
Despite the naysayers, this would be nice to have and explore again. A little updating to the story perhaps or maybe some twist of events have taken place (and thus, locked into the Fractal) but it would be nice to go back to the OG dungeons and play through with a team today
---
When you post a good idea here, its like you put them in a trash.  
---
The worst thing is you give some hope and enjoyment to fanbase, but that's all. It's sad :(  
---
The only feeling I got ? Returning on Gw1 to clear them all with a hero team.
---
Their not allowed to reuse gw2 assets.
---
You mean like the entirety of wow/ffxiv/esos world maps? Its pretty much the same right? 
---
New expansion- Clear map and move one. Clear map move on. At least with GW2 they dont charge you for it, its free and map events keep this moving and feeling alive.
---
Mirage may not technically be tacky but if you run it Sigils of Energy (gain Endurance on weapon swap) and Stamina (gain Endurance on kill), plus Energy regen food, then it has a crazy amount of evade.  The only thing that’s a problem for it is consistent AoE or Condi damage that it can’t dodge or evade.
---
Right but this guy seems like a new player not sure if all of this makes sense yet. I may be misjudging the level of his skill but by all means dude if you’re not a beginner and want to try something more juicy go with mirage, really fun to play
---
Should've voted for Gnashblade.
---
I always thought that's phrase is shouted by Hylek. I don't think there even are any quaggans at Tequatal.
---
That is true when you are a company and your concern is staying in the green.
---
But NCsoft is a corporation. They are concerned about constant growth - to keep their investors happy.
---
For them if something isnt growing, it is dying. If it is dying, you axe it.
---
Yup, change the video title to "OMG 100+ g/p/h GW2 farm!  5x the gold of Silverwastes!"
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Slupsloop](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Slupsloop)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I adore Slupsloop and his little singsongy warning of doom &lt;3
---
That there will be sales at August. Save up the cash :)
---
plot twist: he only stands in LA and spams chat :-)
---
Don't complain, just consume.
---
31% drop from the previous year is doing badly in anyones language
---
31% drop from the previous year though
---
Just get a better PC LOOOOOOOOL
---
No, but for real there needs to be a change to culling. The thing that actually shocked me few days ago since I came back to the game to play mostly wvw was using the Best Performance preset actually made my fps worse to the point it went below 30 fps while playing the game on high settings fps goes easily over 60 and I genuinely don't understand how or why that is. Of course it dips when zergs clash in wvw no matter what the settings are, but the game feels waaay smoother with settings on med/high. Maybe it's just my PC but you can try it out.
---
Specs:
---
i7 4790k overclocked
---
GTX 780
---
16GB ram
---
Right now I'm using the Best Appearance preset with render sampling set to Native
---
Cantha isn't new.
---
Or don't consume, it doesn't matter. Or waste your energy on complaining idc.
---
Do they have a color channel affecting the flame circle like the Shimmerwing?
---
How the hell can you see Asura in a WvW blob????
---
I can't decided if you just like being exploited by multibillion dollar copanies that dont give a fuck about you or just dumb
---
Voltaic spear farm fractals.
---
SoOSC all over again
---
Would also add a way to go for Jorbreakers (for the holographic wings) out of season!
---
I'd like it if they even just turned GW2 dungeons into fractals.
---
Oh it definitely is. Many locations have never been visited in GW1 before. The mystic forge with mythwright Gambit, woodland Cascades with bastion of the penitent, large parts of ascalon, the entirety of Orr, etc.
---
East isnt exactly new either it’s the charr homelands and we had that in GW:Eotn
---
I cna understand that someone likes the game but for fuck sake keep some common sense. The moment I realize some company is trying to trying to take advantage of my goodwill I instantly stop to like their products. 
---
Also look at the bigger picture, even if you like something  don't mean it's good for the game. Mount packs are designed to get more money out of your customer base than you would usually would, it  promotes positive loop for the company and their shareholders. It's a short term gain in expene of damaging your brand - and GW2 is already poorly received by MMORPG community.
---
A new continent would be new.
---
The Death Magic traitline is terrible, please stop recommending it.
---
Adding a Shadow Fiend or Flesh Golem to your skillbar doesn't make it worth losing Spite or Soul Reaping just to get some extremely subpar minion traits.
---
Wildstar, iconic? Are you fucking kidding me here? I can get CoH (which was bleeding subs from a failed F2p conversion, a mediocre and unfinished expac and a poorly received update that destroyed the endgame progression of CoH), but WILDSTAR? This game was mocked by every single MMO player out there, my friend.
---
Knew it was a joke as soon as I saw ele.
---
........ no it’s not I’ve been running fine with it with 0 complaints soooo
---
Did it have a new expansion during Q4 2018? No? Ok then.
---
This is actually something I didn't think of. That I am part of the problem and screaming - it is okay to set prices high, there will always be someone who will love that one item.
---
Good point.
---
Nope only one. And justified it with "if people can buy one skin for 2k, what is the reason for me to not buy one skin I want from package for 2k?
---
That's a very small part in the north. What about east of Elona and Ascalon?
---
People assumed that the direction and slow progress of gw2 continued development was because of those projects taking so many resources. And while they certainly had an impact, removing those never guaranteed that gw2 would see a massive increase in its own content. 
---
A bitter pill to swallow for most fans.
---
Off topic: nice flair!
---
Ok by that logic Cantha is new because of the Ministry of Purity we never visited Cantha after the take over
---
Is it a build that's listed somewhere? I'm currently gathering HP to unlock holo and a nice kitless build sounds like my jam
---
Bugger off.
---
Going from GW1 to GW2 Orr was a new region on the same continent.
---
Thanks fro your input, I'll consider that, but at the moment I want to maximise my condition duration. It seems that bringers gives more expertise so I'm focusing on that.
---
That's fine but it like feeding your dog only on his birthdays. Don't get me wrong I do the same. Beside some minor things :3... But that's it.
---
Yet we have to help the game we will actually miss if it dies. Let's start by being positive. Cheers!
---
You can maximise it with food and traits anyway. Having non offensive stats can significantly lower the value of expertise.
---
What's your normal rank? Pretty sure even golds cannot win 10 unrnaked in a row. 
---
PS: I know I'm gonna get downvoted for this
---
Reality says otherwise.
---
Rifle holo is multipurpose so it is not S tier in any one role.Its kinda like a jack of all trades : you can TF , You can plus 1 , u can even 1v1.
---
So if u want to be a very good at 1v1 then play sword shield holo.
---
Have you even faced an ele like illegal math / faenor 1v1
---
All you gain is some lacklustre passive defenses, while losing a LOT of offensive boosts.
---
The game is all about maximizing offense while using ACTIVE defenses to circumvent damage.
---
Holo is very good in PvP and also very flexible.
---
For condition builds you want Curses (condi damage focused) and Soul Reaping (life force generation and Dhuumfire).
---
I see your point, and might consider a mix of bringers and vipers.
---
However I'm not really concerned with damage for this build.
---
what he says : raid player will finish it once and never again.
---
what you say : this poll shows raids need easy mode.
---
Not only does this not disprove what he said, it doesnt even have anything to do with it, and is at most subjective. Readings not your strong suit is it.
---
sword/pistol no kit is for boy, holo rifle with kits is for men...condi engi is for gods :D
---
Came here to say this. Necro is allways a good pick in this regard. Mesmer is good too, but it requires much more skill to play it correctly.
---
I allways avoided necros, but I tried it once and he became my favorite class for open world. Most of the time I wasn't able to solo HoT HP's, but with Scourge it's like a walk in the park lol.
---
Yeah thats what im running in raids but are there any other non condi (good) builds? I heard scourge healer is a thing but lazy to get plaguedoctors yet gonna have to look into it. Also is reaper still viable?
---
No, *you* look useful! You *all* look useful!
---
When I'm bored, I switch to my Mesmer to spam GS5 in open world to see people like you blame the Rangers. I'm not proud of it but it's surprisingly cathartic. :)
---
I dont get why ppl ask for stuff from GW1 as its better to create new ones raher than recreating old, already used ones.
---
Ah I see, I didn't realise that condition duration could be capped. Is the 100% cap 100% for the relevant boon/skill?
---
Essentially I have a [fear-based necro build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vRUQNArYWjk0QvNWeDG3AHOOqFK4cGANA9NWjyIuBZQKA-jRRUQBfSJIA2f4Sm/OmyvRq+DA-e) and I'm trying to get the most out of my fears as possible
---
The two things that keep turning new players away is the lack of real rewards for effort and the lack of balance when they dip their toes into WvW/PvP.
---
Only server that offers daily blob for 4.00-14.00 cest is desolation, but they are fighting against wooden doors, because no one bothers to play against them. FSP or UW offers probably the best chance to fight it at the moment.
---
During the eu morning to early prime its pretty low activity everywhere, espercially during summer, unless its weekend. Uw Fsp has at least this matchup huge activity in ur stated timezone compared to other servers, but its boring empty tower capping mostly. Weekend is pretty fun tho and acitve, we had queue 10 am this saturday on eb and enemy hadnt yet given up against the numbers.
---
Then they can start giving me content to buy, not skins. 
---
Otherwise my money stays in my wallet.
---
Rigged, I tell you!
---
At the maximum possible cap of 100% conditions last for twice the base duration. [Rune of the nightmare](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Nightmare) is already one of the best duration runes but it also has extra fear duration. Also this is all assuming you don't just take [fear of death](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fear_of_Death) which automatically caps fears out at 100%.
---
the rest of the story happend in LS S1
---
I would also recommend Angeels to learn holo from.
---
Aurora Glade (Or it's link, Riverside), due to the recent bandwagon. Try aim for something that stays under T1. Why, you may say: Those in T1 are always PPT'ing, not wanting to fight with quality. Instead, let's take Gandara, it's Siege Wars.
---
Heal scourge is more of a mix of Marshal and Magi stats. Snowcrows has a pretty good build guide.
---
Power Reaper deals some pretty decent DPS with a very simple rotation.
---
Yea but a computer running linux is still not the same as a switch, xbox, ps or what ever.
---
&gt; Anet even earned a little more
---
Since last quarter, yes.
---
But dropped 30% since last year's Q1 and this little uptick is just stagnation.
---
Oh I know, I'm just saying, it's not that much of a plot point, could be just as well mentioned offhand in her secret lair.
---
Would much rather have a fractal flashing back to ancient Arah with Abaddon. Would be a bit more substantial lore.
---
You are correct.  The info points out how many players have "At least 1 Magnetite shard"  
---
It is fair to point out that there was a VERY long time when HoT exp gain was locked behind having to kill one of the raid bosses and fill those masteries in order to begin recieving spirit shards again... Which I imagine caused a great many people partake in that 1 kill.
---
Because the Gaeting Crystals never affected the open world AFAIK, those numbers are going to tell a more accurate story.
---
&gt; gw1 still has a healthy population
---
Ehm... have you tried to find a group for a mission or dungeon recently? You may find a full group for Zhaishen missions/quests but that's it. 
---
And have you looked anywhere else than american districts? it's totally emptyness in europe.
---
Where do I sign?
---
Last time I spent money was PoF. When I know another xpac is coming. I get hyped and buy gems to “prep” my characters.  Too bad there may not be xpacs in the future. LS does not hype me at all.
---
Yeah, but PoF was released late 2017.  
---
We would need player graphs to factor in.  
---
Could have been drop of playerbase during 2018.
---
How about classic dungeons? They need some love so urgently!
---
Putting resources into fixing/updating/adapting janky content vs creating new content with the most recent tools and assets.
---
Same as META and viable :D
---
If they get more money than it cost them, they have no reason to stop.  
---
They may change what they plan to invest in it, change priorities, ...  
---
But as long as it bring money, they won't kill it.
---
Riiiight. So the fear of death trait maxes out fear anway. That sucks, I wanted superduper long fears.
---
Thank you for your answer(s) they've been really helpful. I currently have Carrion gear and Necro. runes, so I'll look into the others you mentioned and see how I feel.
---
Thanks again.
---
I have a question about sigil of blood. From the Wiki:
---
* Heals for 453 at level 80, and an additional 1 health for every 10 [Healing Power](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Healing_Power).
---
* The damage portion of the siphoning effect scales with [Power](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Power) at a rate of 7.5%.
---
What does it mean that it scales with power at the rate of 7.5%? Assuming my power is 1000.
---
Everybody is bashing the dragon or collecting skyscale...
---
&gt;  plus almost all raids are already GW1 nostalgia catering.
---
Not really, it's actually only Wing 5. 
---
Wing 7 only takes place in a location we know from GW1, but that's it. 
---
All the other wings are completely knew.
---
Basic Mounts - get the Raptor, Springer, Skimmer and Jackal from the PoF base maps and level up their masteries
---
Open Skies - the Griffon collection, flying mount that's probably the best reward in the entire game, also unlocks griffon speed challenges
---
Funerary collections - a series of collections for exotic armor that will direct you toward some interesting content and locations in PoF, if you complete them all you get an ascended armor chest
---
Triumph of Conquests - collection to defeat all the legendary bounties, opens up a secondary collection that rewards an ascended weapon chest
---
Severance collections - there are a series of tombs that you can explore in Desert Highlands to find pieces of old exotic weapons, they fetch a decent price on the AH
---
Lasting Bonds - living world ep2 collection series that rewards an ascended bag
---
IG-6417 - living world ep2 collection series that rewards an ascended back item
---
Roller Beetle - living world ep3 collection series for the beetle which is the fastest ground mount and unlocks beetle races
---
The Convergence of Sorrow - living world ep4 collection series that rewards a nice looking exotic armor set, part 2 rewards an ascended armor chest
---
Chasing Tales - living world ep5 collection series that rewards an ascended weapon
---
Skyscale - living world ep6 collection series for a flying dragon mount that can permanently hover and can make a fire field
---
Warclaw - a mount that is earned from World vs World, available to PoF owners
---
Specialisation weapons - each class gets an ascended weapon collection for their elite specialisation
---
After all of that:
---
Raids - Hall of Chains, Mythwright Gambit and The Key of Ahdashim
---
Legendaries - legendary weapons as well as the legendary trinkets Coalescence and Vision
---
Note: most collections for ascended gear are not time efficient or gold efficient but they are more fun for certain types of players
---
You know that the last episode came out 1.5 months ago, right?
---
Home instance nodes are not about "becoming worth".
---
Countries don't matter because of megaserver.
---
You just want those thighighs, don't you.
---
Cheap healer food for healers?
---
Delicious Rice Ball costs a ton and Bountiful Maintenance Oil cost crystals to make...something cheaper then these 2 would be awesome to know about!
---
Kiel and her damn waypoint discount. Now waypoint costs are almost irrelevant. Go figure.
---
fenixwarrior is still crying in chat? what a legend
---
In the past we had story episode once per 2 weeks. We shouldnt wait more than 1 month. Its too long.
---
what about wing 4 with dlassio
---
Yeah there's no way they will be able to keep this MMO going for over 7 years.
---
Oh wait...
---
Bullshit.
---
ANET is getting funded.
---
If you missed the memo GW2 was no longer the main focus of ANET.
---
That has now changed and they need to show growth in profits/expanses which with a downsized team should be easier.
---
Also you dont axe something immediately - you milk it for as long as you can.
---
OH it goes to the beast, I was thinking it went to the player ... I should read more carefully :P
---
Yeah, nvm what I said, Soulbeast conclave is a great upgrade to the PHB beastmaster.
---
No problem I’ll add that to the text for consistency, thanks for review :-)
---
graphs :)
---
&gt; Really?
---
Yes really, things take time to come up with, think about, design, implement and ship out. There is enough in the game to keep you entertained for more than thousands of hours, if you only play for the story then it feels long but, you know, you can always play something else since nobody is forcing you to play the game.
---
And judging by your other comment I don't think you have any idea or clue what it means.
---
When Season 1 and 2 released the episodes in a 2 week window we didn't had a whole new map available to us with new vendors, new story, new masteries, new collections and so much more but rather only 3 maps (silverwastes, drytop, Kessex Hills with and without tower of nightmare) and the story, other things too but not to the extent we have right now.
---
Another thing is that we had a pretty long content drought in the middle of the season so that the devs could catch up and it was not sustainable for both the devs and the players as well because you are constantly pushing for the next release. Even worse, if something went wrong you had players not being able to play at all for a large percentage the content was available, especially since Season 1 was only temporary available.
---
season 1 and season 2
---
true
---
How about this post?
---
Those were way smaller though.
---
I'm all for being randomly sniped out of mount when near a map limit :)
---
So many people getting baited by this post is unreal.
---
[Fuck off.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/2019-05-14)
---
Being immune to CC 1s after being free from one, and can't get CC if you're already CC ?
---
Yeah, but that was what OP meant which just shows how uninformed OP is about the whole thing.
---
ANET PLEASE SAVE SFR
---
&gt; Holomancer
---
Stop self-exposing yourself.
---
I don’t play gw1 but I welcome the idea of new fractals!! But not too draggy ones pls... 
---
God damn siren reef...
---
Your "bases" in WvW (i.e. where your waypoints are) change every week so if the pet is deep into enemy territory then you can try next week when you might be in a more favorable position.
---
If you want to get it asap then you can try equiping as many movement and stealth skills you can so that have more chances of escaping enemies (many just won't bother chasing you too much).
---
Also jumping up and down repeatedly when you see an enemy is often seen like you are saying "I don't want to fight". Not everyone will respect that though.
---
Also, being able to upgrade all festive nodes like the candy corn one would be great.

Ah, yes...it must be because I care that I keep feeding you more comments to downvote, and upvote yourselves. Surely must be the reason I leave my comments up so they can rack up downvotes.

You're not very bright, are you?

One major problem for WvW is that Anet only attempts to balance based on playtime.  In PvP they at least try to make matches based on player experience and skill, even if that is not always successful.  Servers like SFR and Piken fill up with new players entering the game mode who want rewards/WxP and karma training.  Then they end up in a match-up with a server like WSR which is filled with veteran players who like to fight and the result is pretty obvious.  
---
WSR was up against SFR just before the relinking and they appeared to have really high numbers on the maps most of the time, but the quality was really low.  It was mostly PPT blobs and players pew-pewing from walls and seeing how many arrow carts they could build.
---
Then people complain about stacking and bandwagoning.  WvW is a team game.  Players who take the game seriously and put effort into learning their class, playing meta builds, etc, just don't want to be in the same team with people who are "PiSS OfFF LeT me FuNz".  Not much you can do about that unless Anet finds a way to artificially balance the mode without causing everyone to ragequit.
---
Welp, we did visit the realm of torment, it's just that Kormir cleaned up the place.
---
After her leaving it though we could see Abaddons forces trying to reclaim it. But the devs have said that Abaddons story is done. So unless we get a fractal about it it's most likely not happening in any way that you'd wish for I'm afraid.
---
he dies everytime
---
The hype was there, but if you watch the video until the end you'll see how the everchanging scope, the half-baked idea of hardocre experience and awful economic entry dictated its end.
---
It sounded well, but the only good thing that was eventually appreciated was the housing system.
---
&gt; no payoff in the end  
---
W1-3 was foreshadowing LS3. They realized later raids shouldn't be related to the major story.
---
last month those BEST guild BEST player move to SFR from ROS\~  
---
now relink \~SFR+ROF \~ same boys just move out to other server at first 1-2day ASAP\~
---
  
---
the funny part is those BEST guild/player sh!t talk to XXX server\~  
---
but now move back to same XXX server Look For Carry but no more sh!t talk ?! XoX
---
You have a pretty bad memory if you already forgot.
---
It would be interesting if they didn't drop the 2nd sylvari tree and we could find that.
---
Yeah, I am not suggesting we have all new fractals that never revisit gw1 stuff. Its good to have bit of both.
---
However, we have to keep in mind the pace of which new fractals are released. At the moment new fractals are released once every two LS chapters, and each chapter is released once every 3-4 months, so we can expect only 1-2 fractals every year. So not only we won't see a huge number of new fractals in near future, but the time between each release is rather long. This is important because if a new fractal visits gw1, players will need to do the gw1 themed content for 6-8 until a newer fractal that explores other stuff comes. For those that do not like gw1 themed stuff or feel like we have abundance of it, this may be a too long of game time.
---
I also distinctly recall (but cannot give sources) that devs want to have 25 distinct fractals at the end so there is one of each fractal in every tier.  If they intend to stop there or at least halt the release schedule temporily, we can expect only 5 new fractals as we have 20 distinct fractals currently. While this is not too relevant to this discussion, I think the potentially small number of  newer fractals would affect the variety of content we would get there. Even 2 gw1 themed fractals would be significant.
---
english?
---
There was a tiny part of Woodland Cascades in EotN iirc. A filler map linking the Depths to the Far Shiverpeaks. Too bad it never was properly expanded (besides Bastion) in the current game though :(
---
maybe you want to update your system then. for most ppl i know and also for myself every encounter in wing 6 just does fine fps wise.. and it also did on my previous machine which was from 2013
---
I love your comment thank you stranger
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Clairyx/Standard_Raid_Foods
---
The problem with unranked is that it usually is nonbalanced af, so you can get total begginers against you, or you get legendary team trying new stuff...you never know and such games can end very quickly. Especially when you can premade whole team.
---
New location, new bosses, new story. Well, we knew Cairn as Jade-Constructs from GW1, but we also know them in GW2 from Bloodstone Fen. 
---
Actually the only nostalgic there is the Eye and Saul in the end. And since the Eye of Janthir was part of the GW2 story as well, it's only Saul. I mean you could remove Saul (and take a random NPC for the fight) and it would be the same (except for the last cutscene).
---
Good to know, one more reason not to buy them.
---
Your days for BoD and CoS are off BoD Mythic opened on the 29th and Method got Jaina on the 5th shortly after Limit started reclearing. You are counting from the opening of normal to the clear of mythic. To compare the first raid of PoF had only 1 guild clear CM dhuum within the first 3 weeks of the raid release.
---
Yeah that's actually what i've been doing but to no avail, my gaming time turns out to be in the mid of night since i'm not from Europe, guess i will have to be patient then
---
Do you think zones, voice acting, new items, mounts, skills, etc just boop into existence?
---
This takes time. It might be quick for us to finish the story, but it still takes time to make all this shit.
---
Dungeons are only peripherally connected to the main story line. Most of the lore/story you can get from dungeons, you can get from reading the Guild Wars 2 novel Edge of Destiny. In fact, it's better from the book than the story dungeons themselves.
---
That said, story dungeons can be soloed for hte most part. There's no one specific build to do it. Just check out builds on meta battle and experimental.
---
I’m glad we got Thaumanova. Seeing Scarlet in it makes me worried that had Gnashblade won we would’ve seen Scarlet shoehorned into his fractal. And that would’ve been no good at all. At least scarlet being in thaumanova can make some sense? It also means if we ever get Gnashblade’s fractal now there’s no chance of Scarlet being in it.
---
oh, in fact I made a typo, I wanted to write "have" indeed. Won't correct it in my previous message, the downvotes were legit
---
This is one of the best things about GW2. I think that skin/dye combination would make my list of the ugliest things ever done in GW2, but that doesn't matter because it's yours and you like it. Keep having fun.
---
I struggle with heat management in open world so i go for the extra heat bar trait thats the only difference when i raid i go with the link. Overall its a great build with flashy effects and such.
---
You said you weren't against difficult content, but then you described it as easy content. I didn't make that up.
---
Some things just aren't for everyone. You describe things you don't like as bad design. GW1 and GW2 have very different combat systems, yes, but describing the GW2 combat system as flawed because you can't kill raid bosses while being immune to damage is ignorant at best and arrogant at worst. You sound like the latter.
---
And the hypocrisy in the last bit is palpable. I'm not going to deny that I was worse at GW1 than I am at GW2, but that was kind of the point. Even as I was, I was still helping most of the people I ran into get stuff done because they couldn't on their own. There was a large portion of the community that was significantly worse than me, and that's the portion of the community that you think GW2 raids should cater towards. That level of player in GW2 would not be able to complete the elite missions of GW1. That level of player regularly struggled to complete normal mode missions.
---
And after that, you made another point for me. You thought I should have browsed the forums more, which is exactly what you don't think GW2 players should be held accountable for. Yes, I did watch YouTube videos and browse forums. That was how I came up with the builds of the heroes I completed UW with.
---
It's also not that I didn't have "at least some" of the statues. Here is my HoM calculator( https://imgur.com/Y6k5z1k ). I played a good bit. You said that I don't understand what a casual is in GW2, but your idea of a GW1 casual is so far disconnected from reality that it's unbelievable. Fun fact: most casuals suck. The ones you described for Guild Wars 2 don't even know what their skills do, yet you think I'm bad at GW1 when I made a a group of heroes to do the UW on my own? Your parallel is broken at it's very foundations.
---
It amazes me whenever people bring up the old dungeons as though they're expected to be relevant content. We have 5 man endgame dungeons, they're just called fractals instead of dungeons.
---
"Who's better than us, Vinny?"
---
\- Brad Leone, It's Alive
---
GW1 was 7 years old when we got GW2 which is now 7 years old aswell
---
and you should stop parroting the BS that ppl tell you. not **one** release since HoT/LS3 was "only 2h".
---
Stability..dodges, etc.
---
Game is alive, content is released periodically and population is doing well.
---
I’ve heard this said a few times here, but never seen a source. Do you have one?
---
GW2's target audience isn't people seeking prestige for their gaming prowess
---
Yeah, feels bad. Being linked with ROF. Happened that for WSR. Worst 2 months experience ever. Trying to communicate to Wy Man is like talking to a wall. I kinda feel bad for FIRE guild members, to have such braindead leader. I'm sure some of FIRE guildies have some talent, but being lead by Wy Man himself it's like skill limiter. 
---
Server population adjustment never made any sense, WSR's full/ very high till this day, and yet, it's what? Already like half year, we don't have any day time coverage. I don't get it how this pop adjustment makes any sense. LINKING especially. Linked to frenchies this time, fun thing, their day time is dead as well ([https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/499618557793927168/595893657668812800/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/499618557793927168/595893657668812800/unknown.png)) WSR green btw.  
---
I've no idea what kind of stuff devs consume, but pretty sure when relinks come, Anet just pick names from a hat and link what ever they pick out.
---
It's a fkin joke no doubt. And don't worry about your current link. Pretty sure anet give 0 fks, so just wait. It was glicko reset, got put to T1, over the weeks 1U1D system will put you to like T4-T5, where enemies are your level.
---
Another thing to consider (on top of what has already been said) is fields and blast finishers. You may be granting yourself might by using certain skills in the right order. If you changed skills or weapons recently, it could explain why you're giving yourself Regen instead of Might. Without knowing your class, skills/weapons, it's hard to say exactly what's going on, but look into finisher combos. You can tell if a skill can combo into a finisher (or set a field) by looking at the skill description.
---
combined with your username, that's a killer two-part epoxy
---
Of cource compared to Q12018 we saw a huge decrease, but this might be influenced by the previously released expansion.   
---
If you go even further back and compare it to the pre PoF and post HoT era, we are slightly above. So that in mind i think the game is doing pretty decent in terms of sales compared to what it used to do.
---
But considering that there are more pricy things in the gemstore which might have pushed the sales a bit i think the overall motivation to buy things might be stale ( that is just an assumption not a fact btw).
---
Even tho i think if ArenaNet wants to see a bigger bump in Sales again they need to go back to the expansion model as soon as possible. Of course expansions have a higher production cost but without an expansion the community remains more or less the same and is most likely decreasing. So to bring young blood into the game you need a major release like an expansion. Living Story as a in between concept works just fine, but as a long term concept it just bleeds out the game.e
---
So basically you mean I can try hard my run and watch an anime episode after or watch 2 while doing them, that's a win-win in my book :p
---
Joke aside that's a very interesting point. To be fair I have only ran T4s and CMs from time to time for a while so I probably have not encountered the kind of situation you are describing. The main issue I had was related to being able to always maintain 25 might when DPS was not the best but I guess your recommendation would totally solve this I could run with a Staff.
---
My main issue with FB was/is that a lot of the big healing is behind F2 that has a not so small CD but I guess the passive healing makes up for it by a lot. I usually had not too much trouble keeping people topped up with heal Ren because I was not greeding too hard for Kalla elite uptime (ie. not swapping to kalla as soon as possible).
---
I suppose you pick Jallis mostly to proc the Elite when a big hit si incoming or on a more regular base because you have 75 energy when you swap to it anyway?
---
In any case thank you very much for this advice I will try to see how it fares in my future runs (I'm not pugging but my friends and I are not try-harding fractals either)!
---
Cancel your sub and don't buy any more season passes
---
Fractals are great but the AR wall makes them a poor selling point. They're legit my favorite thing to do in gw2 but "They're really good but you have to do the shitty low level versions a bunch to play the fun versions and you need ascended gear for the arbitrary gear wall" is a pretty tough sell.
---
Why can't they just also have regular dungeons? It'll never not be ridiculous that they just gave up on dungeons completely.
---
Let's give guild halls a greater reason to exist before adding any new ones.
---
Maybe get to the endgame before complaining about it?
---
Just my 2 venta, not trying to flame you.
---
PS: last night we had to kick a weaver. He was doing under half the DPS of my friend (who is also a weaver). Our renegade actually ragequit mid skorvald...
---
Its lord krall. Hes trump supporter levels of delusional except anet is his orange buddy.
---
Except it says right there REVENUE, not PROFIT.
---
Same issue on Piken.   
---
We're "full", despite not even hitting queues during primetime. To top things off, we don't have a linked server, which leaves guildies stranded and unable to join us.
---
Very disappointed in the WvW team atm.
---
They don't even have to remove the lantern, just remove collision on it, or adjust it so it's too high too jump up to.
---
Depending on the group/context I skip on the Bountiful Oil (and maybe get a bit more boon duration from a basic oil if my build is not capped in Boon Duration) because they can be overkill and a bit wasted.
---
For the healing food the most important part is the 10% modifier and the only other food that has that is more expensive that to craft than the Rice Balls.
---
Are they called Conclaves? I don't remember it being official, but even if it isn't it's a great name
---
Apologies I couldn't be arsed to read the report. The heading of this post mentioned the 64% fall in **PROFIT**
---
mmos dying is a meme.
---
theres just more types of "mmos" than tab target games now.  destiny is considered an mmo and has over a million concurrent players daily.
---
WoW isnt dying, it had a terrible expansion and people have unsubbed it can always come back.
---
people think because wow once at 12 million players and now it doesnt that mmos are dying.  No, wow just had a strangle on the market as it was the bigges online game for years, and now every game is online.
---
ESO and FF14 teams have both said that their player numbers now are the highest theyve ever been.  GW2 is suffering because its not on console
---
Dungeons are tied to main story in relation to destiny's edge. You don't need to do any of the dungeons to progress the core personal story except for Arah which Anet made soloable (the story part of Arah that is).
---
Yeah, the chances are engine rework so it works on console, or new game.
---
Pfft, I wish. Nope, just Lead, meaning Magister and myself who lead the troops, as it were.
---
Ok but we are not talking about size.
---
No, it's not.
---
Definition: impart knowledge to or instruct (someone) as to how to do something.
---
Leaving someone to practice by themselves without giving them knowledge or instruction is not teaching.
---
We should count ourselves lucky. WoW players are likely going to have one more patch to last them to the next expansion which would likely be next year. LOTRO just got a new story update after 5 months of waiting. 3 months is actually a good timescale. If you don't like it then don't play the game till the next update go play ESO or Final Fantasy 14 or WoW while you wait GW2 doesn't force you to log in every day. You don't have a sub to get the most out of so go play another game.
---
I'm not sure how far Anet can account for player behaviour though.  Like Piken being scared of WSR so they PPT like crazy when we're not around and then Alt-F4 during prime-time.  I'm sure Piken and Kodash will come alive for their next matchups if the enemies are less scary.
---
Unfortunately not. Nothing you do in the game rewards gold in Path of Fire, sorry. /s
---
Out of context yes, but considering that we've been 2 years without and Xpac it makes sense. There's only so much money you can make selling BLK and mount skins for 2 years straight.
---
&gt; they would need to make fractals that look like the dungeons
---
You are talking about size, there is nothing different between fractals and dungeons aside from multiple paths and the size.
---
It could be a mix of both, to slow down the combat pace a bit and to disincentivize skill spam:
---
* Break stun: 0.75s immunity to CC. Not simply using a skill that breaks stun, using one while stunned so you break the stun.
---
 * This way stun breaks are always useful, giving you just enough time to dodge away to a better position or use some other defensive skill, instead being pointless skills if they do not have stability or if the enemy can also remove boons easily, since they won't be able to just stun you again right away as you break stun anymore. 
---
* Cumulative stun resistance: Using CC on someone who is already stunned would give them a stacking effect that reduces further CC durations on them by a %. If enough stacks are accumulated, they lose all stacks and get a free stun break. 
---
 * This way more spammy behaviors and less organized teams are punished if they gang up CC on a single enemy to burst them down in one go, if they do not watch out for their CCs and use them all together instead taking turns.
---
Sigil of Blood deals damage, although the damage dealt is independent from the healing
---
You heal for 453x0,1healingpower
---
You deal damage equal to 451x0,075power
---
More power means more damage, but not more healing. The healing depends on your healing power.
---
We'd nuke them most likely.
---
Even respecting hardcore players requires a presence in a community outside the game. YouTube and Twitch are big audiences, but they're absolutely miniscule compared to the group of people who just play the game and don't bother searching for additional content. 
---
Smash has tens of thousands of viewers on Twitch, but sold millions. You can see similar disparity with actually popular streaming games like Fortnite or League, and GW2 doesn't even lend itself to hardcore play or spectating. The bulk of the money to be made is in casuals who sign on now and then and buy a couple mount skins, not hardcore raiders.
---
EA bad, CDPR good.
---
What tier of karmic retribution is efficient for Sandswept Isles?
---
What global trend would you use?
---
I pulled a different question out of your post than others it seems. You've been told about condi might tempest's viability, but it seems like you're asking about changing from that to something like harrier since you said heal slave. You wouldn't be gimping yourself too hard if you did heal/boon tempest since you'd essentially just be replacing a druid at that point. If you can upkeep might and fury and healing, many groups should be okay with having you around instead of a druid.
---
Thanks for your input, but I'll carry on regardless.
---
Umm I went back to ffxiv the game is very much alive and had its highest active sub recently. I use to spend 100 a month supporting anet now I just spend 12 ish sub fee to se. ffxiv shadow-bringer is the best expansion I ever experienced and I haven’t felt like this since my first video game. I agree in general mmo are declining but there are still millions who are playing. 
---
Gw2 lost me during the long content drought. There was nth much to do After you make 15 legendaries etc. I love the story but after I finish it is just done. In ffxiv since not everything is in gem store, you could level crafting ( actually leveling with real skills etc like battle class) make money by selling cosmetic etc. there are 7 crafting and 3 gathering class with full set of skills. That it self is a huge amount of content. 
---
I love gw2’s bank system esp crafting ( aka zing) etc , but they need to put more things into game that is achievable through achievement not just gem store( yes you can convert gold to gem and farm gold I know). Ffxiv revive dead content like dungeon through daily roulette giving you current gear times etc! In many ways gw2 is ahead of its time and it was my first real mmo. I will always play and support them but to come back fully I just need more content. Honestly , it is still an amazing game for adults with busy schedule to jump back and in. However it is also because the lack of need to grind new gear, it lacks “ content” that other games force you to grind through each time level cap hit higher.
---
Wish I could give you 20upvotes
---
GW2 wiki is all we need.
---
A good GW2 wiki, not like the one we have now.
---
I mean
---
Love it that you have fun fearing stuff
---
But prepare to get rekt on expansions
---
I see the appealing, but just saying that you will run into some troublesome situations

But by all means, go for it for as long as you have fun

Verdant Brink (Heart of Thorns) has the easiest access to exotic armour of any stat choice

---
It's easier than that. Koda's Warmth is account bound, so you can't mail it to anyone :)
---
Holy shit yes all of the above please.  
---
Also add expanded tool tips:  
---
* show skill range/aoe on mouse hover
---
* show breakbar value on mouse hover
---
* show full attack chain/stealth/ambush on mouse hover

I don't know why you went from word of mouth to twitch viewership.
---
&gt; The bulk of the money to be made is in casuals who sign on now and then and buy a couple mount skins, not hardcore raiders.
---
Every single f2p game makes the larger portion off its money from whales and there's no way gw2 is not the same. Of course that's a shallow argument anyway because a games value and long-term propositions do not come exclusively from the money spent in it or the people specifically doing that. It also requires active communities both in the game and out.
---
Would be cool? Sure. But imo taking into consideration the day and age we live it I’d rather anet go ballsdeep with anything else. It’s hard though since we’re the commander. But hey why not pull out something from your ass if that something might be gold. The commander could be like “I’ve done so much yet I feel like I fucked up everything. I must go into exile” *commander travels far far east to the other shore and there begins a new life (player housing?) but he’s forced to pick up his weapon once more because the demons from the mist have invaded and he must protect the fisherman monkey people (a new playable race?)
---
&gt; I don't understand why many content creators do a sort of error when think Gw2 need educational contents and push too much effort to this things.  
---
because the game is terrible at explaining any mechanics and throws the idea to your head "that anything works" while most stuff anyone would try out is medicore as fuck.  
---
if you straight up compare the pugs of old level 50 fractals and dungeons back then there where a lot more people which did know what they have to do or why certain stuff is played in that way.  
---
today nobody cares, being a special snowflake is the norm so content creators within that area rather go to other games instead of doing another "i play some openworld and shitchat".
---
viper renegade is a build i believe
---
ok
---
Are you gonna ask this for every single item you receive now?
---
Nope, just seeking for an opinion
---
When you connect this with the fact no expansion is coming for a year, maybe two or ever, this is indeed bad news.
---
All ncsoft games are p2w (except Gw2). No wonder why people stopped playing them in the west.
---
Of these 3 sets, Vipers all the way.
---
Herald runs mainly Berserker's gear.  Renegade runs mainly Viper's for DPS OR Berserker's/Diviner's hybrid for the popular "Alacgrade" build which is vital for several group comps.
---
What channel are you talking about
---
&gt;   If you do that it would be more appropiate to conut the days to the first clear of heroic the 2nd difficulty of the raid similar to gw2 CMs. 
---
IIRC both W6 and 7 got cleared within a few hours precisely in CM.
---
I was mostly comparing the best GW2 and WoW had to offer in terms of PvE challenge.
---
But you are right, GW2 top difficulty (cm) is closer to heroic or even normal in WoW.
---
&gt; 1 guild clear CM dhuum within the first 3 weeks of the raid release. 
---
In this case it is mostly showing the small size and the lack of investment of the GW2 "raiding scene"
---
Only Woodenpotatoes and reddit. I can’t relate to any other content creators really, they all seem to have some retarded agendas.
---
Op is an troll account
---
slaughter your pet and eat it.
---
All they need to do is replace that white dye to make it less hideous. :)
---
Yea OP is an troll account , his prev post about gw2 has been deleted and or removed from several subreddits as he posted them there
---
I want a fractal that makes everyone sylvari in the magnuma jungle. Where the fractal voice is the tree lady person. You have to fend off waves of incoming soliders and occasionally rescue one who has been brainwashed. Finally the boss shows up and the voice warps to mordremoth the boss you are fighting is the fact commander. There is one for each of the party members and they have the exact same stats/traits as you just pumped slightly. Periodically they commanders plead with you to "snap out of it!" And "you're being controlled" this is what causes the agony in the fight.
---
As always, it depends. Conventional thinking is that you pick Viper's as they are expensive to craft and you stated you play mostly PVE. On the other hand, Celestial might be a better pick in certain game modes IF you are running with an organized group (guild, buddies, etc.); or depending on the game mode, your group's role (havoc, cloud in wvw for example) and your specific role within that group  Grieving might be better.
---
I say when in doubt, pick Viper's you can always get a set with one of the other stats later.
---
The glamor system has its limitation mainly because ffxiv was revived from 1.0 within less than two years. The codes yoshi p and his team had to deal with was spaghetti. They are suffering the consequences still daily due to it. I hate the glamour system in ffxiv. Both games are not perfect and have its long list of flaws. But ffxiv is still pretty fun for millions of people. Gw2 is still fun for many, but in between story patches I find my self in other games. When my works etc in real life picks up, I tend to go back to gw2 fully since I can manage time better.
---
at this point the only realistic way to to freshen gw2 pvp is to introduce something new, so this might help, in my opinion our 5v5 lacks both dynamic and strategy/tactics, it’s just close+mid or “try sides guys” these days. 
---
Well obviously balancing could also freshen the shit out of pvp, but something tells me it’s not gonna happen, especially considering the recent changes to scapper, holo and whatnot
---
:P I mean it only for those very high cliffs framing the hidden garden JP where there is no reason to actually ever go unless you want to break into the JP. Would go well with the elemental theme and make for an exciting and dramatic plunge. 
---
As a general solution to map boundaries, it would be the most rage-inducing thing ever. xD
---
You have power and courage, but no wisdom.
---
Oh you're EU anyway.  If you were NA I was going to tell you to avoid Dragonbrand like the plague.  It's only entertaining for those occasional weeks when Monkey isn't banned.
---
3 Living world releases in 2018. if you dont count festivals...
---
I'm not a PvP person, so I'm okay with passive survivability. I'm guessing Mesmer would have a steeper learning curve? I don't have a lot of time to invest. It's just something I'd like to play more casually.
---
Where did I say more than 3 released in 2018.
---
Thx!

It is extremely boring in early game I can’t even stand it and I went back to ffxiv full time and play gw2 in between. It is only fun in raid etc and trial. Almost every single friend who tried ffxiv ended up buying jump potion lol 😂. I like both games, both have flaws and ups. Gw2 ‘s drought between story  is how I ended up in ffxiv. They are for different audience slightly though. Gw2 My first real mmropg , ffxiv I met my husband in it. 
---
I main healer( sch rip)  too ... so this expansion other than healing intensive fights which aren’t they many yet, Gave me 3 buttons to press umm 😐 to dps.
---
Wouldn't there be a tactical advantage to disable standard enemy models then? Why don't more people do it if it means potentially easier identification of the commander?
---
*cough* Jagex *cough*
---
Go look in the other threads where this was discussed.
---
Wing 6+7 give development to characters actually in the GW2 world. Zommoros is someone you interact with in this game. The rest indeed, is just finishing up loose ends from GW1.
---
Well, the question I asked was what you got out of but I'm glad so many others replied! In a sense, it really made me realise I didn't know what I didn't know :)
---
I see... Thank you :) Just to check, in a purely T4 setting, would pugs ever request the heal tempest to swap for more offensive boons despite being able to upkeep might, fury and healing?  
---
Also, if I'm running heal tempest, the preferable way to go is d/wh for the spike heals instead of the staff right?
---
Okay, explain how it isn't then. I mean, they could've gone any other way with the story but they chose to bring back White Mantle to appeal to GW1 players. The entirety of PoF is the same. Why not do something interesting storywise instead of going back to worn out GW1 stuff?
---
can you explain "retarded agendas" to me please?
---
You're being downvoted to the underworld but the assets being in the game suggest that something will come... maybe a signal of the end times.
---
Didn't we get the quartsz crystal node as a S1 purchasable award not from FotFW?
---
This must be it! Thank you.
---
Yeah, but it develops something actually relevant in the GW2 story instead of historical characters only mentioned in a previous game.
---
you can solo on both dh and fb(and core guard), there is so much you can do in terms of precasting abilities to set-up a nice burst
---
since you're clearly new i'd say your best bet is some condi fb build because there are many adds in dungeons to reset your f1 and spam it forever
---
having quickness and other boons is extremely important so spec for that..you can technically precast those too(especially with some boon duration gear)
---
not sure what's the optimal build for solo but i bet [this one](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition%20quickness/) will get the job done
---
you can replace the elite with renew focus and take a focus offhand(don't skip torch though) for more defense, should you need it
---
If you like both minecraft and guildwars, then I just need to link the game I made for this year's april fool's day: [BuildWars](https://kulinda.github.io/buildwars/)
---
(It works in your browser. Just don't try on a low-end mobile device.)
---
What are the best / most thorough W7 guides out right now? I'm playing druid and would like video + written guides to get me started. Thanks!
---
Curses also has the trait to heal for 10% of the condi damage you apply. For a open world scourge , that one trait blows the whole death magic trait line to shit.
---
Scourge healer is good, and can carry bums , but says it's a healer is a weird term. It's basically barriers and regen. Mine is full Magi with flock runes and does very well.
---
Reaper is quite good dps , and is quite simple to play. Mainly for PVE open world , but there is a guide for pvp / wvw on reaper that went up here on reddit just today.
---
You really, really overestimate the gw2 playerbase. The things if'ver seen... \*shudders\*
---
What build do you recommend for power reaper?
---
Thanks for the reply! Assuming I'm going to pug a lot for T4s, would you say there's a higher number of quickbrands out there as compared to the meme healbrands due to how much easier it is to gear a quickbrand as compared to the latter option? If that's the case, what kind of renegade should I run if I see more quickbrands out there?
---
If there's no more expansions coming then for an MMO that's basically the same as maintenance mode. Living story is not going to bring GW2 out of its rut. All it's doing is extending the gemstore sales for those casual players that currently keep the game alive. 
---
It's unfortunate they went the path of catering to mostly casual open world play because there is so much potential with the gameplay and systems that will likely remain unexplored or undeveloped. And God damn there is so much old content that is awesome and left for single use living story stuff. Other games would have slapped on group mechanics and made it a dungeon or something replayable but instead it's left to die.
---
Such a waste.
---
Yeah but you have literally posted the exact same post  like 3 times and people have told you the same general reponse each time. Even the item is exactly the same
---
WvW been a mess since last Tournament. Populations have been manipulated by players and developers across the Link System, with poor excuses about "we can't remove servers" or "we can't merge servers with different languages"... confirmed lies actually, since megaservers make "server identity" outdated for competitive mode, and the actual "plan" proves that language never was a problem for linking servers.
---
Excuses and more excuses.
---
Players brought Alliances as "lifesaver" when they will be same thing than actual system. My argument is supported by the long silence that WvW team keeps since last news we got... news that, said be, caused a lot of confusion and disliking along more tries of explaining/confusing were posted. Clearly, WvW community was buying smoke, and Anet was glad of this, hoping this smoke would keep players quiet.
---
After many months of silence, as OP points, we have no news about this "fantabulous" Alliances system... probably 'cos devs are noticing how wrong will go, since it won't resolve the main issues the game mode suffers since years ago.
---
More players leave the game mode 'cos boredom. This incentive to blobbing killed lot of roaming guilds, and the few ones that survived are damned to join the bandwagoning or die.
---
WvW needs to address many troubles:
---
1. Worth rewards for incentivizing new players to join. Yes, it's a "poor" reason, but let face it: many players want their spent time rewarded fairly.
---
2. Real balance between teams. Call 'em servers, alliances, gangs... whatever... but change the game mode for incentivizing the balance and avoid third teams to be stomped without mercy 'cos lack of interest or feeling of helplessness 'cos not having enough coverage/population.
---
3. Make structures really valuable, that people really learn it's important to attack/defend/capture.
---
4. Balance the value of PPK (Points per kills) and PPT (Points per tick). WvW is a massive fight and siege activity field; both scoring systems should be fairly balanced for the sake of stopping this bullshit about "&lt;write here the concrete score system&gt; is shit!&gt;", about manipulating matchups going up and down in the leaderboard. Every server should play both systems in a healthy way, and be rewarded 'cos this reason. *I know this point will mean lot of dislikes, but I don't mind a shit about it, honestly. People who think only one of both score methods is valid, is lying to themselves.*
---
5. Give a purpose to the game mode, not only the "just for the love of big battles". Give it something deeper, that offers a real motivation and repercussion.
---
6. Offer places for GvGs and duels where deaths don't cause drops in the score, or give them an own game mode where they can enjoy this.
---
7. Make roaming valuable again. This includes making guilds really a thing for the game mode, not only a nice tag and lot of buffs.
---
8. Fix the \[censored\] lag that is caused in Stonemist, for the sake of...
---
I could continue with more ideas, but I think people will get the point. I want a really inviting game mode, with all servers having lot of people in the most of hours, with timezones not being a red line, with offer for every player who joins and that all those players can enjoy and contribute in the way they wish.
---
**#makewvwgreatagain**
---
can you give a link? i cant recall seeing one of those

https://youtu.be/OKiFEr-UPew
---
It’s definitely not as profitable as it used to be but some people still run it. Dragonfall is a good map to farm. And silverwastes riba is still good.
---
Pretty much dead. The two metas are only good for one run each, per day.
---
Trust me, if you have to ask this for every piece you get, believe me when I say that what you select won't matter and you won't notice a difference regardless of what you choose.
---
Unless you understand what stats do and what is its context, then you won't know how to tell apart someone with +28 ferocity and someone with +28 expertise. It will be all the same for you. 
---
So yeah, the answer is pick whatever you think is best. Honestly, there is no way that it would make a difference for you, right now!
---
Wish Anet would actually put it in the game but after all this time I doubt they care at all
---
The old Istan farm that you watch is kind of old news. Istan is still a thing, but not the multi-hour that it used to be since there's a limit of how many Chests you can get from the metas per day per account. In my opinion, the best ways for anyone to get easily join in some farming is to join a LS4 train, HoT Metas (TD, AB, and Matriarch in VB), Silverwastes RIBA, Dragonfall, and T4 fractals. All of those listed happen daily and can be found on LFG. Once in a while, if a commander knows the events, they could run very specific map farms such as Sandswept, Kourna, or a POF event train that can be very profitable.
---
If its on Earth, they'd just fall asleep and starve because ain't no Magic here except at Disney!
---
&gt; Living Story as a in between concept works just fine, but as a long term concept it just bleeds out the game.
---
They have to be able to actually build an expansion though and that takes both time and people. With what we heard about teams being pushed onto other projects before the layoffs and pulling everything back in after, LWS5 is probably the buffer they need to be able to work on it and we'll see an expansion teaser around the last episode. As long as they don't try to rush it.
---
yeah, i really just don't understand the hard on they have for LS unless it's like one of the lead guys passion project or vision for the game, in which case it would make sense why they stuck with it, because they sure as hell aren't sticking with it because it's profitable. if they went back to an expansion model and did it properly, they wouldn't have to do all their dirty little tricks with the gem store, lootboxes and forced bundles of 5 medium to low quality skins. this game could be a great mmo but for the mind-bogglingly stupid decisions behind it.
---
&gt; ArenaNet, you won't keep **me** interest**ed** if you release it that slow
---
FTFY
---
Not going to disagree that Piken WvW is empty this week. Last night we couldn't even muster up the numbers on our hbl to fend off the enemy blobs.   
---
Guilds and tags are trying, but you got to admit there is no point throwing 30 pugs against a 25+ organised group. Anyone knows that's a guaranteed lootfest for the organised party. Instead of cowardice, it's logic to not face a group you'd be guaranteed to wipe to, no matter how many times you'd charge at them. 
---
Believe me, I think Piken's guilds would like to provide your servers with decent fights and some resistance. But a lot of guilds depend on the linked server to have their members play with them because we're "full". As it hasn't happened, some guilds lack a lot of players and can't play their usual style. That's the issue I wanted to address as well. 
---
Hoping that next relink we'll get a link again and can offer you more fun!
---
When I first did 100% map completion on my main (which is like 4 years ago) I pretty much rushed through it and didn’t appreciate any of the events, exploration, or dialogue. I’m now going back on an alt and trying to experience and interact with everything that I can. Are there any interesting/fun events or secrets in the open world that I shouldn’t miss out on?
---
I don't have an addictive personality and have personally never struggled with stoping that kind of behaviour, generally only paying cash for things I want. That being said this leaves such a bad taste in my mouth I might stop altogether.
---
Anet has nerfed istan in many ways (Amala champs, daily chests, etc) to force people to visit other maps and not stay on one map farming the same thing over and over after their first round of it.  Because I of this, two things have happened: many people have migrated to the most recent map (dragonfall; see xteh's post on farm rotation) or haves developed a meta schedule (type in-game /wiki event timer).  I usually command a ls4 meta train and make a meta schedule for myself:
---
Meta Schedule (3 hours):
---
Pala/Gy/Akili/Smoldge/Gh/Brewmaster &gt; Thunderhead Oil &gt; Jahai Shattered/Djinn/Incursions &gt; Thunderhead North &gt; Sandswept North/Specimen/Dominus/Mark 3 &gt; Kourna Meta (multimap)
---
"We don't want to make Living World a live thing anymore because players will miss on the story".
---
*Proceeds to sell out expansions with story chapter microtransactions so players won't miss the story... unless they don't pay or buy it on time!*
---
If you can withstand the massive lag and loss of the easily identification of classes by just looking at the model, sure.
---
Man I really wanted that Abaddon fractal, still a little disapointed we lost that.
---
I’m a simple man - I see dungeons, I upvote.
---
Okay thank you for the precision !
---
Lore videos.
---
...that's it. Huh.
---
It's reddit. Everyone assumes negativity when there isn't direct praise. \o/
---
Step 1: Pick the build you want to play at snowcrows/metabattle websites.
---
Step 2: Gear up according to your build.
---
Step 3: Don't be silly.
---
This sounds amazing. Would love to play it
---
&gt; Lord of the rings doesn't take part 250 years from each other.
---
And what's the difference now? (If you take the whole lore, you have similar gaps, but however.)
---
&gt; Compare W6 and W4. One shows the inner workings of and explains an object which most players use regularly for crafting, finally properly introduces the djinn behind it, gives lots of lore to all kinds of GW2 stuff.
---
We literally get there, kill some bosses and that's it. Zommoros say a few sentences about the Mystic Forge, there are a few books and that's it. There is no "lots of lore".
---
On the other hand Wing 4 no only ended the story of a long forgotten character AND gave even more background information about him, it also gave a story/history about the whole prison including the story behind Samarog and both of her slaves.
---
&gt; The entire ending and titles are making sure nobody ever hears about this (Silent Saviour) and thus it can contribute no further to the story. Fun.
---
Oh, you mean just like Wing 7...
---
I've been playing GW2 for 7 years and i still don't have any idea whats going on in the story. The life of an MMO lore/dialog writer is one of unrequited love.
---
*This* triggers you? Do you have the mining nodes (especially the iron one)? Just asking. ;)
---
I would be very excited to find a 'home' for every race. Like the blood legion, a second tree, another Norn settlement that reclaimed   parts of old. We kinda have that for the charr with the Olmakhan and a few attempts of the asura but more is welcome.
---
I hope the devs don't just forget the Olmakhan in the future.
---
Once per day.
---
What gamemodes do you tend to play? What weapons are you using?
---
Yup I learned all the skills almost played 15 hours of Herald. I realized that I can't survive half as good as Dwarf at fractals or open world. Dward hammer skill combined with Retribution skill line feels insanely tanky and good and Because of Herald skill line I can't take retribution. Idk maybe I will like Renegade more?
---
I run all the life steal skill line and retribution skill line. I have so much regen and life steal it is insane. I will try Dragon dwarf too.
---
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if anet saw some losses. After everything that happened loyal players may jump ship, meaning less gems being bought. 
---
It's not a big loss though so maybe we'll get more insight to what's being done so the game isn't seen as a dead game by those outside of the community
---
You know how the Inquest does all kind of terrible and dangerous stuff to profit form dragons/dragon minions and how it always ends exploding at their face and fucking up the enviroment?
---
Well that's what would probably happen.
---
I have the iron ore one yes, working on getting all home nodes! but is there something evil about the iron ore one? :S
---
After everything that happened loyal players may jump ship, meaning less gems being bought. 
---
Plz dont give them idea's it would drive me insane! :O
---
I run the devastation line full of life steal skills that gives Shiro insane sustain. But I will try dragon dwarf too thanks for the advice!
---
&gt; the boss you are fighting is the fact commander
---
i got a giggle out of this typo
---
Because equating certain stuff with another way more ignorant/harmful stuff gives some weird vibes
---
But why ?
---
I spend a crap ton of time here, can't recall the last time I saw a thread about the wiki being not good, so I'd hardly call that beaten to death.
---
So, source? Or are you just making baseless angry comments and then "go look it up" handwaving when you get called on your crap?
---
Exactly my problem. The class felt so smooth changing legends at the right time for more energy doing auto attack chains and stuff and I insanely loved it. For Herald I just open all facets dump proper ones and switch to assassin. It really didn't speak to me maybe I am the problem idk :D
---
[Duncan the Black in GW2...](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Duncan_the_Black)
---
Its a meta event you do once a day now, Everybody went back to Silverwastes for a unlimited farm or the new Dragonfall map for easy rare gear
---
Hard disagree since I really dislike the GW1 story, but to each their own.
---
Yeah just take Mesmer hero to interrupt them all, super interesting.
---
While you wait for a response, check with your bank to see if there was a problem with the payment.
---
Lmao if you can't see the entire interior of the mystic forge you're blind. Or the lore books, story, etc.
---
W4 is basically nothing of interest in comparison.
---
The argument of no endgame is simply not true today. It hasn't been true for years.
---
RIFLE
---
So some kind of hunter, I guess. I don't know, I just want to be able to use a rifle skin on my ranger :p there are so many good ones. GW2 seems to be forgetting its steampunk side a bit.
---
if I see more reapers in my games Ill blame you.
---
Cool!
---
Oh I see. It really confused me because I have a warrior and a necro over 100 hours too and core classes of warrior and necro can never beat their elites. When it came to rev I felt the need to play as a core and that felt weird so I asked on Reddit. Thanks for the help!
---
"Conclaves" are the name convention for the revised ranger from the UA material.
---
Elite specializations power crept the *game* not necessarily each class for damage. 
---
Herald shines most in an offensive role rather than DPS. Generally you're going to look for Assassin (Shiro) + Dragon (Glint) and frequently swapping between the two. It's not specifically meant for solo play however still as most of their abilities are for 5 allied target. 
---
My assumption is going to be you're working with Devastation 231, Invocation 213 for your base class specializations. Herald's traits specifically are tailored around being support in both defense and offense. For your solo play, I'd recommend 113
---
This ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MFLeIAgL0M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MFLeIAgL0M) ) represents an upper bound of what you can expect when you're fully buffed and booned but notice your the statement in the description is that about 2-3k of your damage is actually missing in this parse because it uses Shiro's Facet of Nature in that account.
---
If you feel yourself struggling with survivability on dwarf over assassin specifically, then there might be something to be said about your damage mitigation. Damage mitigation in this game is kill things faster than they kill you (which Shiro would do because of impossible odds), evasion (ie dodges), blocks,  and reductions (protection, % reducers). Because damage reduction is multiplicative scaling though you'll still want to evade the biggest attacks and heal up afterwards if you need to.
---
The soldiers you are "saving" are ending up in those conversion pods.
---
What the heck are "Ingos"?
---
Im level 80, what now?
---
It's always hilarious to read you because not so long ago you were a new player. Now you are a full grown keyboard warrior making arguments of things you don't fully grasp.
---
&gt;we would need a miracle to compete against FFXIV, and even ESO.
---
Oh yes comparisons. What facts are you basing your comparisons on?, please do share any links.
---
i mean thats better than games who wait a year or years for expansions...
---
TD hasn't halted any of my purchases :o
---
Mhmm, exactly. And consider the fact that we got to go to Abaddon’s vault as a map and story instance if say that the player base won all around.
---
Shield 4, it reflects projectiles back at their source.
---
I was a big advocate for expansions but they have been a huge letdown for me.
---
I wanted expansions because I was hoping that paying for content would mean more repeatable content and more ingame rewards.
---
Instead we got more of the same, it's just glorified living story content with extra features.
---
I love these ideas but like a lot of homebrew they're really poorly balanced.
---
Much like GW2, you'll almost never want to leave beastmode because commanding your beast requires an action just like vanilla beastmaster
---
Beastmode gives an effective 10 HP increase per level, effectively increasing the player's HP by 150%. Rangers and druids are now the best damage sponges in the game. It also means they no longer need a dump stat and get absurd advantage with something like pack tactics.
---
Stout aspect offers huge bumps to HP when hitting proficiency milestones, potentially increasing HP by another 120 at level 20. Not as strong early game.
---
Versatile makes you outshine the defining feature of a knowledge cleric
---
Deadly and support aspects are fine
---
Rangers and druids with beholder rays and dragon breaths is nutty.
---
Astral form is pretty bad. You can already get stout and support by assigning one to each pet and your attack will outpace the ones given to you by your pet.
---
yeah. NCSoft is a Korean company, and a lot of their MMOs are primarily made for a Korean audience. they also happen to publish GW2.
---
I thought the new version of ICM just adapted to the new action camera, does it still binds 1 to the left mouse button when turning on action camera?
---
Love the dialogue, it's practically ready to be copypasted into the game. Amazing job here.
---
You could try to setup something like https://github.com/jacob-keller/L0G-101086
---
This tool uploads to dps.report and then posts links to a discord chat so you can find them all later.
---
Alright, not trying to White Knight but genuinely curious: if anet can't sell cosmetics (since the community-declared fashion wars endgame means it's p2w), they can't sell stats/power as that IS p2w, and they can't sell convenience (as that's nerfing their own game to sell it back to you and therefore scummy), what can they sell to avoid having a subscription on the game? They give us content updates for free and only charge late comers to catch up if they so choose, which is great. And no one that I remember made a fuss about the default glider only having a single, muddy stripe dye channel when HoT came out. They even went back and put in the black and white wings as gliders and gave them for free to those that already had the back piece! That's hardly an indication of a scummy company.
---
But, where is the line? Posts on this thread warn against normalizing scummy behavior but not even in Jim's video does anyone state where their tolerances lie. They can only point to stuff and say it's bad, but they never indicate the degree of scummy-ness. Or will we not stop until most advertising is outlawed (due to manipulative tactics) as well as limited time offers/sales (buy now! pressure)?
---
I for one don't mind chipping in for extra account space (nerfed account!) and the occasional outfit (cosmetics!) but have stayed away from key buying and random mount skins, as I detest lootboxes like everyone else. The fact that key farming and in-game gem buying (and multiple achievement gem awards - not just an early 'hook' one) exist also mitigate arguments for p2w as people can still access stuff behind the paywall without actually paying.
---
&gt;ignoring my support request 
---
You said this literally happened today. It can take weeks for support to get back to people.
---
Final Fantasy XIV does this too. There's a quest chain which teaches you all the basic knowledge you need to know and for completing it they're giving you a nice armor. Having something like this in GW2 would be godsent. Not nearly enough players know about breakbars and dodging, even with the "dodge tutorial" in the starting zones.
---
You are comparing a very old game with an already old game. That's diferent environments in every aspect. I'm not defending Anet in anything but let's be realist with this.
---
lol
---
i'm having the same problem. however i checked for updates and i'm on the latest driver, so i have no idea what's causing this issue. i modified the config to use pso_precompile and pso_keycache for quite a while, however at some point i had to change the settings so that i didn't use up all my ram. thought it would be enough but it's still giving me that error.
---
lots of stuttering/hangups, and crashing. i'm going to set dx12proxy to be my d3d9.dll and see if that helps any. it might simply be the order of addons being chainloaded that's causing an issue. i'm not a techie at all so all of this is like operating a space ship to me lol
---
Not only will they not listen to the NPC, they'll even get annoyed with it. Do you know how many NPCs there are in the game that tell you what to do? On every corner, every meta, every boss?
---
Anything less but gigantic, blinking, red letters in the centre of the screen will be ignored to death.
---
I wish ANET would just make dungeons besides fractals. I hate how regimented it is, all the same length. Not only that, but I hate the instabilities too. 
---
I just want one long dungeon.
---
Most of the hardcore players did vote Gnashblade.
---
It was casuals who voted Kiel.
---
As usual, casuals ruin everything about GW2.
---
&gt;	who are very cynical and do this purely to make more money for their shareholders stock-owning executives.
---
Achievement unlocked!
---
Knowledge of all giant corporate evil acquired!
---
Seriously, this is worded so well and applies to so many corporations.
---
&gt; for an account issue. Please contact Support for information.
---
That’s the important bit.  Something may have gonnwrong payment side that you need to resolve with them.  Just work with them and be patient and you will get back to normal in no time.
---
You prob have a first free transfer to spend if you never moved before?
---
You're comparing to a quarter DIRECTLY after an expansion release which is unrealistic.  To get realistic numbers you need to compare to the same quarter after HoT realease, not the one from a year ago.  The comparable quarter after HoT release was only 13,557k vs 16,337k.  Those are VERY different numbers and PoF has consistently outperformed HoT on every relevant quarter.  The game is doing fine.
---
Post-reset Pala used to be the most attended event, but it's hard to justify it after a month or two of boss rush, meta rush, and now Dragon Bash stampedes. I imagine once the more lucrative farms leave it'll come back slowly.
---
Maybe you use the regen boost and now you use the might boost from your inventory that game awards you when you level up. It gives you specific boon for period time longer than your skills (between 5min and 30 min i think.
---
Thanks for creating this version.  My new favorite Dragon Bash  song. Very well done all. Thanks for the good feels.
---
Thankyou for the reply!
---
We finally got him and it was disappointing lol.
---
Hello thank you for the reply!
---
We ended up beating him but he didnt drop anything good.
---
The nice stuff about ranked pvp in season is, that after some time, you either rank up or down to the position with people of similar skill level. Not perfect, but in general that's how it works. 
---
And after all, intensive combat is pretty solid way how to learn more about your class and such :) And it does not take long to throw there some matches every day, and is instant dailies. :)
---
Oof, if this pack had been released before shimmerwing, I would buy it. Unfortunately I see no reason to get a pack of default model based skins (doesn't help that I'm personally not a fan of the default model shape) so soon if I already have the perfection that is shimmerwing. Maybe if this pack ever goes on sale I'll finally get it
---
Your Healing is from Staff 2, 3, 4 and that Bow of Truth Utility + passive Regenration, passive Virtue, passive Symbols on the Ground...
---
Jalis is picked for its semi damage but mose importantly for the stability "street" you build every 6 seconds or so... that really helps a lot in fractal CMs and is consistently great to have around! the elite is too expensive to reliable trigger it and normal Protection Boon / Aegis should do the trick.
---
Hardcore player here who voted for Kiel.
---
You can hate me for it if you like, but know that it wasn't *just* the casuals.
---
You are the pervert here, if you see a school uniform (very common in Britain and Japan) and you immediately think of pedophilia.
---
You know exactly who's the target audience of those outfits.

I hope they do, but I'm not expecting anything until at least mid way through LWS5 when they have that story fully mapped out through the end of that and the story for the expansion mapped out to a "we can work with this and are making assets" stage and not "notes on a whiteboard" stage. It really just depends on if they think it's necessary to put out something now or if finance thinks it's alright to wait a year.
---
you get the story chapters if you log in in the 3 months time period, even if you dont own the expansion, but yeah you obviously need the related expansion to play the chapters
---
That rocked
---
you dont even need to do the "Low not fun fractals", there are like 1000 other ways to get to ascended gear in a few days.  so saying it has a "wall" is simply not true. Its like saying "omg I need be max level to do endgame content what a shit game ".
---
Actually it is, considering that i can literally go into the aerodrome and select a full set of diviner armor and weapons in like 5 mins
---
For wvw a lot of servers are linked to eachother, meaning that players from both servers will play together for a few weeks. Just recently they removed the language restriction on the servers, meaning that German/French/Spanish servers can be linked with eachother and the general (non language specific) EU servers.
---
Right now that means that your server (Miller's Sound) is linked with Jade Sea, which is a French server. You can see the other links here: https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/80778/about-the-new-eu-world-links-6-27-2019/p1
---
Yes, during his fight in crystal sea, before his imprisonment.
---
Bonus events were another thing I always wanted.. but I haven't done any of them. At this point I don't even care enough to log in for them.
---
Anet really needs to do something big if they want to bring back players like me, but with no expansion announcement on the horizon it seems like they are just shrinking instead of growing.
---
Sc's didn't work that way and required different roles to achieve the dungeon. Also, mobs weren't considered trash simply because Sc's strats skipped those mobs to directly go to the boss. Also, sole of the strats were insane and required decent skill, such as uwsc where everyone had to clear its own path to finally reunite for the last boss. I don't think gw2 has ever reached such depth.
---
&gt; I have to wonder why they didn't learn the lessons leading up to HoT
---
Apparently they were working on other projects internally and prioritized them which meant they didn't think an expansion would have been necessary if the projects were completed. Things changed with the layoffs and now they have to play catch-up. That doesn't mean they didn't learn any lessons leading up to HoT, it just means they made different mistakes. 
---
&gt; I want more elite specs, I want more ranger pets, I want new masteries and new parts of the world and I want it with content that isn't primarily focused around the weak story instances 
---
From what they've said something is coming with LWS5 that's "expansion worthy" so it wouldn't surprise me to see something in there like that. Maybe it'll be another Elite Spec, bleeding off the excess HP's you get from the Core maps so we don't instantly have enough to max out a spec on day one of an upcoming expansion, and introduce a few more Core Mastery lines. There's almost assuredly going to be new parts of the world, just like with the last few LWS's. 
---
Everyone has different reasons why they play so that's kind of a weak argument to make. I'd love to have story instances that weren't filled with "play like a coked up lemur dodging around avoiding patches of rainbow colored projectile vomit to find that one tiny 'safe' spot that if you're not totally inside of, which you may never be, you get screwed over, on top of only having limited dodges and those safe spots can be across the field of vomit or hard to see inside of it." We don't always get what we want though, since that's apparently "difficulty" to the devs, so I've learned to temper my own expectations and do the story on a character that makes it easier to deal with. Tedious BS made up GW1 in a lot of ways and GW2 is following right on its heels.
---
In wvw it's very susceptible to ranged pressure.
---
NA: 
---
How do guilds/servers work these days? Is there any issue with cross-rep outside of wvw? 
---
I'm a returning player on Jade quarry looking for a guild that does fractals/spvp (or one of each), but I'm having trouble figuring out how to filter for guilds that might be a good fit, or where guilds looking for members are likely to be advertising these days
---
&gt; This is not true at all. Color do not randomly change, they change depending on your placement in the tier you played in.
---
I never said it **randomly** changes, but I should have been more clear. OP most likely doesn't know that the matchups are redone every week and your team's colour can change after reset.
---
I don't know why you say I made it a big deal. OP asked for help and I just gave my input.
---
Oh man, you're correct. I totally spaced and thought Axejaw in the moment.
---
He's beautiful in his own way lol
---
The German [DC] has been doing this for the last couple of GameComs
---
Not fun at all
---
As much as I want a homenode pinata too, none of these nodes were implemented during the first itteration of all these festivals (and yes it technically is the first itteration because dragon bash during ls s1 wasn't an annual festival just a content drop). Wait one or two years and you will most likely see a home node as the list of event rewards is growing in size.
---
It would be similar if these people committed crimes against others to buy lootboxes. Then you can compare it like that
---
It was the achievement reward for [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bazaar_of_the_Four_Winds_(achievements)](the original) Bazaar of the Four Winds in 2013.
---
we need actual infos. are you running hook with reduced distance fog? have you tried different texture/environment/lod-distance settings?
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Abaddon
---
&gt; In 1 BE, he spread magic to the races of Tyria, and thus was indirectly responsible for the wars that came afterward. King Doric pleaded to the gods and they rendered magic into the five Bloodstones, diluting their gift. Abaddon was incensed and went to war with the others, and **he was eventually struck down at the Mouth of Torment, in a blow that turned the Crystal Sea into a desert.**
---
I just removed hook and the game looks great again! It didn't occur to me that the hook could be the problem because I was using a popular preset. I'll play around with the settings within hooks. Thanks!
---
As far as I remember there is only one pet that is exclusively found in WvW territory, and that would be the https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Wolf 
---
All the other pets ( that aren't HoM-related ) can be found in the normal PvE maps and don't require participating in WvW if you don't enjoy it.
---
Check out the maps on that Wiki page, they show the wolf's location.
---
The desolation is the place where Abaddon died, which is located slightly south of the Crystal Desert
---
Did they not have the select licence when they first came out? I guess that's where my confusion was, because the select costs 1200 gems and you couls just pick the Storm Chased Griffon from that.
---
&gt; there is still time.  
---
No, there definitely isn't. The work for adding a piñata would have had to been completed about a month ago. Game builds go through a process that takes time and they can't just decide now to add a new feature. Don't mistake a change like this with a hotfix. They are not the same thing. We could get one next year though.
---
Oh, I hadn't played WvW in a few months, was just thinking of going back to it. Thanks for informing me.
---
I only watch news videos from Wooden, why should I watch gw2 when I can play it easily.
---
What you described is just plain what happens when you push out the fog distance in hook. The fog is there to hide the low quality distance renders, and AFAIK gw2hook doesn't offer any tweaks to that distance rendering itself, aside from maybe blurring it with DoF.
---
Try hammer and sword/shield.  Hammer 4 is a projectile wall that gives your AA life steal.  That + the regen + well-timed evade from Hammer 3 is how I sustain.  Then when you actually pop the heal, you have to dive into a big long AoE and dodge out just in time so you get the most healing out of it.  Shield, despite the relentless nerfs, is still a reliable source of protection, more sustain healing, and a nice long get-out-of-jail-free block for rough spots.
---
I play a full celestial herald with divinity runes so I'm a lot tankier than you are and I find long range, offensive pressure with hammer, passing boons to allies, to be where herald shines.  Great at Teq or frontline in a WvW zerg.  It may just not be the class for you.  Take a look at Renegade, it's got some neat stuff.
---
We decided to play in Divinity's Reach today by attempting to make the rainbow.

See it from their point of view (if we assume that the bank stopped the transaction):
---
1: You pay for a product.
---
2: ArenaNet supplies the product.
---
3: All of a sudden the money you used to pay for the product is being recalled.
---
4: ArenaNet ends up not getting paid for the product, and therefore revokes your access to the product.

imagine a piece of tech that could just convert a gw1 asset into a complete asset for gw2 ready to go

We need BDS's in gw2

Hasn't he made it into the captain's council anyway? He should honour his campaign promises as a sign of good faith
---
Yeah no the first generation was all lootbox rng, at least you could not get douplicates so if you bought 30 licenses you will get all mount skins! Eventually you'd end up with all...
---
Starchaser Griffon was my thirtieth skin, so yeah ... really got lucky with that one. *cough*

Not that I'm aware of.

I'm on the case!

&gt;It's always hilarious to read you because not so long ago you were a new player.
---
And where exactly did you get this idea from? Care to quote?
---
Unpopular opinion, I think we’ve had more than enough GW1 nostalgia pandering for now. I’d much rather see new areas and stories we’ve never explored before.
---
yes
---
Pride Month might be over, but Pride is forever.
---
Yeah but it hasn't been that way for a very long time.

GG as always, lol tried to convert the Speedy-Build from last vid and ended up nearly the same gear 😁
---
I have almost 2k hours on my revenant and do lots and lots of raids &amp; fractals with it since they came out, and I can assure you: herald+assassin is very strong if you know how to use it. The fact that you can't survive is likely due to poor positioning, wrong builds, wrong usage of skills and overall inexperience on gameplay. As you progress in the game (I mean skill-wise) you'll learn how to time your skills and blocks, and how to make use of your precious survivability skills. Assassin stance alone has a bunch of things to help you deal with difficult situations, especially the elite skill. Make sure you're using your gap closers also to run away (yes, you can use them for that), and if you're running a fully aggressive build, do NOT take attacks do your face, you HAVE to dodge stuff.
---
I'd be interested in talking about a pre-cataclysm Orr fractal tho.
---
I'm trying to get the beetle mount, but I'm having trouble finding a group to get the bounty done. What to do?
---
Especially the boss battle with the Great Destroyer. That would make an incredible fractal (as long as it was scaled for 5 people)
---
Wow vg has been soloed and escort has only been 3 manned.  I guess that settles it, escort is harder than vg.
---
Oh, like the sealing of Abaddon? I would've liked that, actually.
---
I would love to return to some of them in GW2. Not as a fractal, but as a dungeon.
---
I could see some of them being very similar, like Heart of the Shiverpeaks (objective could be to find dwarven ruins) or Vloxen Excavations (return of Zoldark the Unholy), while others being drastically different like Arachni's Haunt (turned into an Inquest base).
---
Similar to how Sorrow's Furnace returned as Sorrow's Embrace.
---
I wouldn't mind some of the big boss battles like Urgoz, Kanaxai, The Great Destroyer, and The Darknesses becoming fractals.
---
You do the Chasing Tales achievements to unlock the "Vision of X" things. You get one for free each time you finish the collections, so buying them is not worth the cost.
---
You did Astral weapons not Stellar correct? If Astral, log out &amp; back in, it may update, if not wait till reset &amp; check after. After that I would do a support ticket.
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
Could have said the same thing and gotten upvoted if you had a bit more tact.
---
People who are addicted to shit have a condition that they cannot control. In many cases they brought it upon themselves: A heroin addict didn't form his addiction by staying away from drugs. That's simple cause and effect: they started using heroin, they formed an addiction. The physical dependency is out of their hands at this point, but they are the ones that brought it upon themselves. Although, a gambling addiction is very different. When you see a high school kid who is addicted to gambling, did they bring it upon themselves? I can only think of one way that somebody that young could have ever even gambled before in the first place: The games they played in the past included gambling systems. And all of a sudden you aren't even a high school graduate and you're in debt... I've seen it happen.
---
you have to buy the item from yana whatever her name is for 5 gold I think
---
These are Thunderhead Peaks weapons, not Istan.
---
Ive been going Dragon/Assassin stance and its been great. Im still a new player and not great by any means but Herald has been proving strong to me. Get berserker gear with scholar rune if you can.
---
Yeah, you're probably right. It was just all the similarities that were there made me think of GW2.
---
Like the quest is handed out by a fish person / the phrase being said by a Quaggan (fish-whale person)
---
You have to kill Eye of the Corruptor / Zhaitan being a corrupter, Tequatl being his minion and Eye of Zhaitan being another powerful minion of his.
---
The quest descriptions mentions how the eye must be destroyed lest it start spreading corruption / Tequatl spreading corruption if you fail to kill him.  
---
If you then add in Blizzards history of easter eggs and the number of previous Blizzard employees working at Anet it's not completely out of the question, but it is probably pure coincidence :)
---
Wow I was way off...
---
That's what I mean by locked. I can't purchase it , it's locked.
---
Gratz! Lowman kills are always super interesting.
---
LFG, map chat, commander/mentor tag.
---
Looks Cool! :P
---
This is only true if you had a free to play account first, and later bought one of the expansions. If you bought the game when it came out, or you bought the game and didn't make a free account, you don't get a free transfer.
---
I usually trigger that event just so she can shut up
---
"Anet saying something that contradicts me does not mean that I am wrong but that they are lying. This is a very sane way of thinking. I am a very stable genuis and everyone who does not agree is fake news."

Counter magic.

Wait..people actually go to DR when theres no festival there? Ewww
---
It’s reputation for the guild
---
The imperfection of the white one triggers me.
---
Obviously because Zojja is still ~~fucking dead~~    ~~out of contract~~   ~~kidnapped by phlunt~~   in a coma.
---
I like how you went after that and *nothing that was actually discussed*. You are a poster child of a white knight, aren't you? Or did I strike a nerve?
---
It kind of is, all you mentioned is extremely generic and can be applied to almost any fantasy setting ever. Fish people and bad guys corrupting stuff is hardly unique to GW2.
---
I don't know where you are getting the idea from that Anet is full of ex-Blizzard employees. MO worked for Blizzard. Like, almost two decades ago.
---
because they are apart of that guild...?
---
Thank you for the feedback, there is potentially a few misconceptions for which maybe you could help me clean up language.
---
Firstly I tried to make the language that you could never summon two beasts at once, your first gets banished when you do. And even in Beastmode that is still only active when your Beast is not banished so would end early. Secondly the CR of the creatures you can summon isn’t supposed to increase, only ever CR less than or equal to 1/2 beasts, the advancement is via the Aspect progression only. Also I tried to make the language state that you only get one Ability Score eg Str of 15 from a Black bear, while Druid gets Str Dex and Con from their Wildshapes.
---
When out of Beast mode you have two options for actions, as an action do an action on statblock ie. Multiattack, or as a bonus action perform one Attack. So for example out of Beast mode you could have a black bear attack 3 times or cast a spell and bear attack once, spells being the main draw for not being in Beast mode.
---
For discussions on health pool I’d recommend comparison to Moon Druid who is becoming a Mammoth with 126 hp while you are becoming a Black bear with 119 hp which is comparable. I think 5+Prof times level is probably too much so I might lower it to 3+Prof maybe. Either way it mirrors closely to the language used in both Beastmaster (4 times class level) and Spore Druid (5 times class level).
---
For Aspects the aim was choose one of the ways Beast master pets advance, “also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls” and gets ASIs while the Soulbeast has to choose one of them.
---
I think most of my response boils down to yeah Beastmode sounds high powered but Moon Druid spec which focuses on wildshape does it even better, or the pet sounds powerful but not so much compared to the revised beast master Ranger. That was the design process take but reduce the benefits of each of wildshape and companions bond.
---
In all the aim was to provide a way for Druid to go in and out of “wildshape” without losing the HP by having a physical pet holding the health pool in between Beastmodes. To give a more realistic reason for summoning/changing/reviving pets than Beastmaster and to balance the pet by more restricted advancement but being easier to control than a BM pet. And finally give the steal  abilities which only last Wis Mod times and disappears if the beast goes back to Feywild. Which is hard coded as every longrest for the Druid version.
---
Already know some adjustments I need to make to the language but let me know what you think I should adjust to make it more clear or places that still need balance.
---
Less tiers is absolutely required in NA and has been for many months now.
---
Commenting to probably watch this later. Been like... probably two years but I used Engi to cheese towers due to large amounts of AoE knockbacks. I guess thumper doesn’t work anymore so it wouldn’t be as useful anyways. There is the uh, explodey boy tho. Blast gyro, shield 4, and big ol bomb work well, stealth gyro and smoke fields for stealth to get there without CC. 
---
Curious to see how it goes on Mesmer as I’ve been out of it for a long while.

Your expectations for GW2 casuals and GW1 casuals are just way too different, dude. Let's use GW2E for a rough comparison. 109,226 linked accounts have the Traveler achievement, or 5 points in the HoM. 8,932 have Legend of the Mists unlocked, or 45 points in the HoM. In other words, I had more HoM points than 92% of the GW2 players who played GW1. It's actually worse than that because I was close to max on most of the titles I was missing. You were able to carry people who couldn't use their skills properly in GW1? Congrats, you can do the same thing in GW2. Maybe you're not good enough at GW2, just like I wasn't good enough at GW1.
---
On top of that, your expectations for GW2 design are nigh impossible. Sure, perfect content would be accessible and fun to everyone. But that will not happen. Realistically, you just need to accept that they need to make different content for different players. If you're upset about the amount of content for small teams (I think that's what you were talking about in another comment in this thread), don't take it out on raids, because they just aren't where a lot of the resources in the game go. The largest issue with content development in this game is their focus on content that isn't designed for replayability. The more players like you bitch every time there's content for PvP or WvW or raids or anything you don't like, the worse off the game is as a whole.
---
You remember when GW2 was trying to run a competitive scene with Pro League and such, right? Well, Pro League had issues due to the balance team (Bunker Chrono permanently marred it), but it still more than paid for itself by their own metrics (they had metrics of view converting to game purchases and stuff like that). Originally, they were advertising the stream for each weeks match ups in the game launcher. They stopped that because it was too upsetting to PvEers that PvP had anything going on when they were experiencing a content drought. They stopped advertising something that was pulling more resources to the game for everyone (and the money came from the advertising budget, so it wasn't related to the PvE content drought) because they couldn't stand others having content they didn't enjoy. The fact is, this game needs different kinds of content to maintain a healthy player base.

Teapot is doing raid guides, albeit slowly.
