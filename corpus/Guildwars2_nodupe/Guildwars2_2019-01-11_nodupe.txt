Thanks for your response! Yes, I found that one. Still need more space, going to work on that tonight hopefully.

Haha, eat that arthritis! I'll keeo you at bay for yet another day!

Just keeps it pretty spooky.

I am working on Chasing Tales: Asaliea the Channeler (focus). The overarching hero panel window for this includes: Acquire the Dragonsblood focus. Acquire the heroic spirit of Asaliea: deed #1, deed #2, deed #3. Lastly on that page: Meet with the spirit of Asaliea at a heroic font. 
---

---
I believe this is bugged because I have individual screens in the hero panel for completion of Chasing Tales: Guidance, Chasing Tales: Locus of Power (focus kill 30 things), Chasing Tales: Storm's Eye (kill temporal storm ele) and Chasing Tales: Torrent of Magic (defeat 30 enemy wielding a scepter and focus). I believe the 3 latter are deeds #1, #2 and #3. Deed #3 on the first page listing all of the steps does not have a green check by it. Consequently, when I approach the font with a vision crystal in my inventory the prompt to let me interact with it is not showing. I'm not sure which of the above is truly deed #3 so I can't tell you which is bugged. 
---
Are they though? In this case for example joining a custom arena for fast dailies where "blue wins" etc i'd say are as far from competitive as it can be. 
---
Next time you wanna sound smart try to remember Improved alacrity exists

Beetle and skimmer. Beetle is too slow at the start and you almost never have the space to drive him without crashing against something. Skimmer bc he is just too slow above land :( (tho I love the skimmer above water)

Sword is more of a PvP-oriented skill set for Guardian. It's used on the core radiance build in a defensive set for the purpose of setting up burst with the fury boon from Sword2. You usually swap to Hammer2 right after for burst potential after fury application. It's necessary in context of that one build because you run very little precision or ferocity through stats, the critical hit % comes from traits and on demand fury from Sword2 in this context. I think that build runs an amulet with no precision, so that's why. In a PvE context, sword is pretty much useless as it's completely outclassed by scepter for most purposes (aoe, immobilize, built in might generation, better range, better synergy with GreatSword traitlines, and so on.   
---
Ascended gear is only mechanically necessary for higher level fractals from tier 2-4. Overall, it's about a 5% overall stat increase from exotic and while you can feel the difference in power, it's not mandatory in many cases unless you play high end PvE on a semi-hardcore basis. It's a means for players to be able to min max without completely centralizing the game around vertical gear progression. And Legendary and Ascended armor share the same stat totals. The only difference between legendaries is that you can change their stat combos at will. Ascended will cost you to stat swap. Hope this helps.
---
Two questions:
---
 
---
1) Are elite specs worth activating even if you're only a few points into them? I just unlocked my first elite spec but I'm only 3 or 4 abilities into the tree so I have a way to go before it's full. Am I better off using a full specialization for that third slot until the elite spec is maxxed out?
---
2) Is Chronomancer or Mirage better for someone that's playing mostly solo open world content? I specced Chrono first because I assumed it was more defensive and would help with my self-sustain, but I can go farm points for Mirage instead if that's smarter. 
---
no staffs from PoF- OP said they were making zojja's spire.
---
That's what I meant while saying that they don't care about match-manipulating. Custom Arenas follow exactly the same rules as non-ranked matches other than not requiring full/balanced teams - they are just not rated by system. Every gamemode where someone loses is "competitive". Regardless - I don't think they will allow multiboxing in Custom Arenas, they would specifically say that they disallow it in Rated sPvP otherwise.
---
So true about the beetle, he feels rather useless most of the time :(
---
Not to be pedantic, but BiS can apply when referring to sigils/runes/ammy/weapon and even traits, especially in the context of min/max. 
---
“Best in slot (also "best-in-slot"; usually shortened to "BiS") is a term meant to describe the very best item, enchant and/or gem available to a character for a specific slot. While there are differences in opinion there is usually a generally held idea of what is the BiS.”
---
I tried setting one up for a friend last SAB, for some reason macro was really inconsistent. I can do it normally at like 99.9999% success but macro tests with various delays/no delays etc. (i tried for 2-3 hours) all failed like every 10-15 tries once or twice. 
---
Still unsure what i did wrong. I even record and copy my own manual presses and was same result.
---
It's.... so beautiful...
---
Feel free to use your army to upvote this post though, that would get you a lot of leverage.
---
I like the idea of Season 5 being a quest to bring Aurene back. Maybe she's shattered herself and we have to  collect fragments. Maybe we have to work to kill Kralkatorrik in the Mists where she is so she can absorb his power there and then return to Tyria. Etc. Honestly, I think both keeping her dead and bringing her back have problems. If the devs are really going to keep her dead, we'll need a huge amount of handwaving or exposition to explain how the powers of a dragon of undeath, a dragon who can regenerate from literally any part of himself, AND an unkillable Lich are somehow not enough to bring back a stump of a dragon (oh yes, there's also a fucking god in there as well). Meanwhile if they're going to bring her back, there has to be something big that happens in balance with that and that's a tricky thing to handle.
---
Been playing off and on since launch and I'm only at 7500 ap lol. I dont know how people even come close. Literally have to do your dailies every day and do every tedious ap worth 1 point. Nuts
---
The way I see it, the story has three directions it can go. 
---
1. Aurene uses the Joko hook to return, similar how Kralkatorrik summoned the power of Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Balthazar.
---
2. Aurene dying was a necessity for her to "ascend" to the mists in order to become a "Dragon God" or some-such mists entity akin to the Six alongside Glint, Vlast and any other yet unnamed scions.
---
3. Aurene's sacrifice was necessary to deal a blow strong enough to Kralkatorrik to scare him into a change of heart. Glint mentioned that he was already fearful because of his prophecy of a world without him, and now we've blown a crater in his face and destroyed one of his eyes.
---
Honestly, #1 seems way too overt not to be "the one" IMO. ArenaNet tend to really telegraph plot twists, Omadd's machine in LS2 really overtly alluded the "too much magic" plot thread, but it didn't end up being outright stated/known to us in-universe till PoF.
---
I can't believe you are comparing the writing in this game to Lord of the Rings. Honestly if the entirety of Dragons Watch and Destiny's Edge got swallowed by Krak and Shat out of his ass, would you really care? 
---
The good thing about Sindrener is that you learn just by watching a regular stream because he always explains his rotations.
---
But Taco doesn't do anything for you. It doesn't help you with your rotation. It doesn't help you make that difficulty jump. It doesn't help you dodge that damaging move.
---
Sure, it helps you with some timers like with Sab and the cannons, but it's not going to do it for you. And before you say that text makes it impossible to mess up, look at how many people get teleported on VG when there clearly is a circle on the ground, a sound effect, and the edges of your screen changing color.
---
Taco is nothing more than a guide that's on top of the game. You could accomplish pretty much the exact thing with a PiP of a YouTube video.
---
Well I mean, technically the build templates are a huge, faster macro. It definitely holds an advantage to swap between builds faster than most normals do, or at least raises the skill ceiling with accomodating rewards.
---
I thought it was a mini pet battle arena. I'm still waiting for it to become a feature.
---
F
---
I've tried. It's absolutely inconsistent and it will screw you over when you least expect it.
---
You can always use a VPN to buy keys :) But I understand your sentiment, that's why I hope the entire EU follows Belgium so anet is forced to come up with a solution instead of disabling stuff (Unless they'd be willing to disable items for every EU country)
---
TacO doesn't in any way interact with the game, though. It uses data from an official front via the Mumble API and just overlays everything on top of the game in a realistic-looking way.
---
Diviners is great for boon Chrono, but you don't want a full set since that's too much boon duration, and you still want as many offensive stats as possible (Berserkers/Assassins). 
---
The recommendation I've been given is to start with full damage gear, pack runes, and sigil of concentration. Then slowly replace some damage gear with Diviners, starting with your backpack, hat, chest, leggings. Maybe your weapons and rings if you want even more boon duration. Once you're comfortable, you stop.
---
The radiant one is really nice actually
---
They may do so in the future, but until then they'll allow this :)
---
Nice, multiboxing in pvp is against TOS now. Let's see if they enforce it. 
---
I'm sort of expecting Aurene to comeback, but in a different sort of way. My current thoughts are that:
---
She'll become essentially a Mist Dragon/Guardian that fights against Kralk on that front while we deal with his physical side. She could, in theory, still absorb his magic and use that to come through portals. Essentially becoming a ghost or even a Lich-type dragon herself (considering she'd have Zhaitan's abilities, too). Or absorb his magic and decide to remove that presence from the world without taking that magic out of the system.
---
My other thought would be that she comes back like a Mist spirit, but can't hold her form long. So, instead, either Caithe or the Commander becomes a new 'host' of some sort for her abilities/powers/mind. Heraldic-style powers insue, although how they'd be different than Glint's, we'd have to see.
---
Either way, we've seen/heard more of Glint than Destiny's Edge ever did when they first fought Kralk (although that could be just poor writing on the book's part because of time constraints).
---
you can enter the purple seal room by the story step or randomly as one of the possible rooms for the daily trial of the light of deldrimor...
---
I suggest to bring a friend togheter, do the story step, and then both alternate with a teleport to friend to unlock the poi with ALL your character, as I already did with my friend for the poi in the treasuer room; taht way you can complete the rest of the map exploration without worries \^ \^
---
The light of deldrimor is buyable off the tp if you don't wanna do the meta. 
---
You may! PMed.
---
I just had to look these guys up since I never played through Factions or Nightfall. Is there any proof that these Saltspray dragons are actually still around? I haven't seen any sign of Shiny while completing the PoF maps.
---
That's awesome, both the painting and that they play together. I love the heart detail :)
---
even doing my normal istan gold farm has become a painful experience since she always appears to assist on the assault the sanctuary meta event :c
---
Same, I had a laugh when my asura replied!
---
The only macro I used is /gg on a single key. I hope this isn’t against ToS. 
---
I have no issue with the death of Aurene, this isn't the first time someone dear to our character dies, lot of secondary characters in the personal story may die depending on your choices, and even big favourites like Eir, Thraearne, or even Blish.  
---
It was also been prophetized in the visions, and, of course, I'm upset more than usual, since we literally raised her as our own baby dragon (wished to soar the skyes on her someday T\_T).
---
For me, the main problem is the immediate aftermath of the event...there's none, except our main character losing hope, and that's it...I was expecting the words GAME OVER to pop out; something similar happened in the end of the bitterfrost story, when your character react passively to braham verbal abuses, like nothing matters.
---
If there were something, even an after dialogue where you character say something like "it can't be the end, we must have missed something" or some of the sort...instead a simple "I don't know..." and that's over, I understand the shock factor, but if your character, the supposed main character, the commander, the leader, if he/she gives up, what the rest of the dragon's watch should do?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think the final confrontation with Kralkatorrik will be in the mists, where Aurene, Glinth, and maybe Vlast, will be able not only to suppress Kralkatorrik, but also prevent all it's magic to return into the leyline system, so maybe tyria will not explode after the defeat of the crystal dragon. There's also the chance for aurene to come back from the dead like we already do, since we're connected in some way. For those who think she'll be awakened or resurrect cause of joko, just remember, dragon's and gods have their special abilities (like raising the dead or walk in to the mists) cause they're forces of nature, Joko was only a very powerful wizard, and, after all, bot the balthazar's sword and zaidra feel's balthazar's powers in aurene, but no awakened feel's joko power in her.  
---
&gt;Note that this does not mean that you cannot be away from your computer (AFK) while you are online. Idling in a city or even in the open world is not prohibited, though your character should not perform actions, participate in content, or otherwise engage with the world while you are away from your computer.
---
Soo, afk farming (nightfall autocast, turrets) while alt-tabbing is not ok now? *About time*
---
It's intended in SAB.
---
Have you heard the word of our lord and saviour Aurene Dragonchrist?
---
Problem is the Realm of Torment was largely turned into Kormir's Library
---
If theres a GW3, i won't care.  
---
I think ill be done with the franchise by that point.
---
just the same as before, if at some point a gms pings you teleports you or whatever without you responding you gonna get a temp ban
---
SAB can be completed without it. It just makes it easier.
---
Also I highly doubt they made it intended just for a SAB when it's been removed from the game more than it's been up for.
---
Actually, the Realm of Torment is still there, and there are still demons.
---
The library exists within the Realm of Torment, but it's moe of a sanctuary more than anything. When Kormir leaves the library, demons start flooding it again.
---
We learn this during the Griffon quest.
---
She died protecting us, and it was clearly stated before that to defeat Kralk, we would have to strike together, which in the end.. She tried going against Kralk alone to keep us safe when we were knocked down. I doubt she would give her life for us just to turn around and say 'meh, you're not my champ anymore'
---
Engineer hammer is mutually exclusive with Holosmith as the hammer was introduced with the Scrapper elite specialization. Regardless, I would definitely recommend sword.
---
I looked back on this and Rytlock's reaction is really sobering.
---
He's been here before. Kralkkatorik branded his homeland. That he already took a crack at Kralk with Glint and for the longest time he blamed Logan for leaving and Eir for leading them into a doomed battle. This time Logan was there. They had not one, but hundreds of dragon's blood spears.
---
Aurene still dies and Kralk gets away again.
---
I am interested to see how everyone deals with this, but for me, Rytlock has the most clarity of what this means moving forward.
---
Im 30k here and I hope they can fix the radiant backguard on asuran before i get to 39k... Right now the backguard is blocked by the asuran's head. An unfortunate side effect of having a big head i guess..
---
if they respond to gms they are still fine, same as before
---
You need to spend hero points/testimonies to unlock scrapper/holo again if you want to use those traits/skills. However, for collection purposes, what you have unlocked previously won't be lost. Refer to the achievement to see what you are still missing. 
---
For most cases, if the text didn't mention it must be obtained by engi, any character can get the item and unlock progress on the collection.
---
I've never found the blue or orange plates for Dwarven Room Raider- the first day I did it, I got red-purple-yellow-green, and both yesterday and today I got purple-yellow-red-green.
---
Does anyone know if there's a "trick" to it, or if you can break/port in for credit?
---
Can someone link me to the reddit thread where they were discussing alternative Deimos tanks?
---
For example, when the team is doing the range strat, having a Chrono tank is not that important because the Chrono's boons will only go to the oil kiter anyway. So assuming the tank can play other classes, it's more beneficial to try Heal Rev as tank because it is self-sufficient and can provide more group support.
---
Thanks!
---
This is the typical retarded attempt to stirr some shit out of a widely used third party program. Reminds me of that guy that got arc templates to delete his infusions but it was just him while drunk.
---
Grow the fuck up.
---
oh boi!
---
Well... Hope he didn't get fired for that...
---
I felt like kralks face wasn't much larger than the mordremoth face that we fought. It might have been a perspective trick like they're known to use, but it definitely seemed like it was a lot larger in the Balthazar battle. 
---
How would they know you're using taco when it's an overlay that doesn't interact with the game at all?
---
I still say she branded him and he's going to be falling under her influence.   
---
Though this doesn't give the devs a clear path to a knock down, drag out fight so probably not.
---
But you can only trade it in once per day.  
---
I have the same issue. Looks like it is because the Torrent of Magic achievement is giving the same reward as Storm's Eye (both give the Storm's Eye item)
---
Sounds like you have some personal issues. Telling people to "grow the fuck up" on a video game sub reddit won't help your mental health.
---
Just wanna chime in that beetle is amazing for travelling long distances for the first time on a new alt. Basically the perfect mount to unlock WPs. 
---
Beetle also made my weekly key farming more enjoyable, specifically for the level 20 and level 30 personal stories. When I did level 60 key, I had a beetle route down for Harathi Hinterlands to reach the Skritt cave in the north western part of the map. It was like having my own personal race course heh. 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence
---
Playing a game doesn't make you immature.Telling you to grow the fuck up doesn't make me mentally unstable.
---
There are still some niche reasons for using a macro. Maybe have one that only opens 20 or so bags at a time so your inventory doesn't overfill.
---
That's true but the post stated you need to do 2 metas separated by an hour each to get the jewels, which isn't necessarily true since the items you get from the metas are tradable. 
---
now thats a good joke
---
Take a break than do it on another armor class, every time I reach a goal in this game i get a comedown so I break for a bit. Come back, enjoy my newly kitted character, then work on the next goal. Or try a new game until the next chapter.
---
It's the top mount for rough terrain where the raptor's large leaps don't work. Also for uphill stretches or very long and very fast mid-air teleports. Thanks to the endurance regeneration you can perma-teleport for its entire duration. Since the griffon is quite clunky, requires wind-up and a large area to navigate, you can just hop on your jackal and perma-teleport all the way across a chasm that would be too far for a raptor leap or too cumbersome for the griffon to slowly flap across.
---
Well those arent automated things, Like the Arc Loadouts. Cause I cant find the thing that happened between Anet and delta. Can you show me that please. wanna read it so I can get a grasp on it.
---
That's a thing now? How do we do it?
---
Please. I'm sick of the humiliation-yellow every time I need to use a diving spot.
---
This one starts right next to the Durmand Priory heart in Thunderhead Keep from time to time. I stumbled across this one while doing the dig sites for daily.
---
Same in sPvP (at least in combat) I think.
---
Arc has a buildtemplate add-on 
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65547/policy-third-party-programs
---
Here is something else that just came out
---
It's not. Just a low effort shit post.
---
I would go with heal fb who can actually aegis everything.
---
GL playing for another 10 years then.
---
If I were you I’d up my warrior game because banner slave is needed everywhere and the class plays like a dps. 
---
However, between DH and Chrono I’d choose DH. DH is cheaper to gear and versatile enough to change skills and traits according to encounters. It has great burst and cleave but sustain damage trails off a bit. 
---
As for Chrono, if you aren’t playing a support then be mentally prepared for pugs throwing a fit because they thought your dps chrono was a boon chrono. Things may change with Diviner’s gear though, time will tell. Personally, I think open world power chrono is very fun to play. I’m using that on the latest episode atm. 
---
Go for DH. Solid raiding Class as well. As you said you can't obtain gear easily, so zerker gear is one of the easier stay combos to get. The upcoming Quickbrand build for Fractals uses full zerkers too, so you even got some alternatives to rolling full DPS. Don't know how hardcore you are planning to run Fractals though. Also getting into raids as chrono might spoil your experience, since people still tend to expect a lot.
---
As DH you can kinda blend in. Big plus for chrono on the other hand, it's meta on all bosses. If you decide to go chrono wait for the dust to settle over the new diviners gear if your care about build optimisation.
---
Aw man
---
I don't think it is really described the same judging by this
---
&gt;You cannot use macros to create skill chains in any competitive environment, including PvP, WvW, open world activities, races, etc.
---
and the fact that it doesn't speak against any other content. It seems like its actually ok to use skill chain macros now as long as its not competitive, like using macros for opening burst rotations in fractals/raids.
---
Ya that's what promoted this thread. Was wanting to know what has changed and not in regards to the rules.
---
No, the intended method is to jump forward and quickly back to the previous rock to bait the jumping rock into jumping, then jump back on it and continue forward while it's on a brief 1-second cooldown. If you label the rocks as 1, 2, and 3, the intended sequence is: 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 3. 
---
As long as it is armor. If i join with legendary gear and you are there in the gear you spawned with after tutorial at lvl 2 we are still equal as long as you have 4 armor pieces.
---
No it's not.  I downloaded the addon today.  I read people recommending it so I tried it out.   It makes it much easier changing builds now.  I was hesitant about downloading it but glad I did.
---
&gt;moving around and positioning 
---
*Especially* for 100CM where being caught in a blast is an instant KO. Wtf were they thinking? This goes to the person that suggested this clusterfuck and the devs that think this is a good idea. 
---
I’d *love* to see Slippery Slope activated for raids. The amount of backlash would be monumental. 
---
it'll also probably be a good idea to hoard at least 250 of each map currency for the season 4 maps. Im guessing just like season 3 with aurora, that there will be its own legendary introduced with the final chapter and map, and that will most likely require a full stack of each for the mystic forge.
---
I think the whole point of instabilities is to add a layer of difficulty like Challenge Motes. Key note here is difficulty, not impossibility. If the instability can't be counteracted by a better player or more effort, I don't see the point of it. You could be the worst player or the best and this instability still fucks you over and that's exactly why I don't like it.
---
I'm just got into GW2 was Cantha any good in the previous game
---
The city was terrible, but all the cosmic stuff, the luzon pirates and the Kurzick goths were really awesome. The music and atmosphere was great. The raids, the deep and urgoz Warren were so cool. The pvp was great. And I think people just like the east Asian influence because it sets itself apart from the rest of the game and added a new flavor. Plus many people loved the ritualist and assassin and stuff like that. I just liked the feel of it the most.
---
I made a macro for it last SAB and from my experience it would only fail very rarely. 
---
Record it, screenshot any chat if there is, add timestamps, when and were and account name and send it to exploits@arena.net
---
If you have solid proof so that they can check the account and verify it they will act on it. Might take a while and you will for sure not get any info about it from them but that is how you do it.
---
Am I reading this correctly? There is a massive amount timegating for the new stat?
---
https://www.godsofpvp.net/api/tournaments/
---
Only one I know of, maybe there are others. The website also has excellent guides and builds. 
---
seems to me that a mystic forge script would be ok as long as you have to manually click to repeat the cycle each time, and i'd be fine with clicking to repeat as sometimes the available item screen shuffles content with it gets a duplicate.
---
in lfg, you can sell a spot in your raid, but you cant offer to buy decorations for your guild hall. maybe there should be a trading page.
---
Open all is pretty god awful with anything that gives currency items like Winterberries. It just rolls one and multiplies it by the stack. 
---
Would you mind sharing your macro?
---
I tried about every thing I possibly could and still couldn't make it work.
---
Maybe ping has something to do with it? I don't play on the best latency.
---
Not as far as I'm aware. 
---
A single skritt wouldn't be smart enough to be a playable character, but say, 30 skritt? That sounds more like it. 
---
technically a dps meter does give you a great advantage over someone who doesnt have one. as you will practise and learn the best way to get higher dps over someone just winging it. i have no problem with that because it just improves your personal game.
---
It's a lot easier when they're dead, see. 
---
physical aurene is gone, i doubt they will revive her, but spiritual aurene may be still about, tho do hope they dont keep her around long term, let her finish up kralks story then we move on when we deal with next threat

Troll’s Revenge jp is visually my favourite jp in the game. I enjoy doing it without mounts and glider to appreciate how well the jp is integrated into LA. Used to do it everyday before I bought expansions, now I’m too busy with other end game content.

I just slammed into this.  Bought keys for all the alts.  Got my necro through yesterday; got the key for Consul's Tomb first and did the whole thing no problem.  Today running my Mesmer through I got two other rooms then Hammer's; no key for Consul.  I now have to either do the story with the character, or acquire another key and hope the next time I'm allowed to do the puzzle I'm given the key that gets me the POI.

This runs counter to all other exploration design in the game.

I just made a macro for my logitech g600 and it works 100% of the time. I made the alternate key to / for dodge and no delays between events. The order goes like this: hold down space, hold down \, release space, release \.

&gt; I just don't find it remotely interesting or enjoyable to have a mechanic that causes you to lose control of your character

This is true for pretty much any game except those going for something along the lines of IWBTG.

When you combine the plate halves you get from both metas, you can do the dwarven Catacombs mini-event. There are 2 hidden chests per room that have a chance of dropping the jewels. And there is a final chest in the last room that drops 3. This chest is the one OP is talking about.

Loved that. Unnoticed the Inquest guy on a second playthrough, talked to him, and thought, "neat, what a cool detail." Then I felt this surge of pride when I ran to the last crystal and see him holding off a horde of branded alongside the Olmakhan. Then when Kralk hyperbeams everyone, they're gone. Crushing.

Everyone is jumping on the misuse of they're but the real title gore here is the abuse of pronouns. Really should be my parents, my mom, my dad. As its written him appears to refer to the closest singular specific which leads to confusion as a mom is presumably female and probably isn't gifting herself but there isn't any other specific person that him can refer to. Even if the current writing were easily understandable it should be avoided if possible as it is overly hetero-normative requiring the audience to assume that the second parent is male.

Jumping puzzles! I forgot to mention their jp designs are good too haha. I found some of them while trying to "investigate" NPC houses or just trying to explore corners of mountainous areas. It's quite fun to do these in this game. But sometimes it's kind of frustrating when I kept falling. Lol. There's alot to do in this game. I think we need a few years to get some stuffs completed (including the seasonal cosmetics items) xD but it's fun this way and we won't ever get bored. 
---
In the interest of throwing new ideas out there, what about Livia and the Scepter of Orr? We’re already a member of the Shining Blade and she trusts us. It has power over souls and to a certain extent, necromancy. It could possibly be used to activate Joko’s Lich powers in Aurene. Bit wild of a thought but you never know.
---
Jackal. Every other mount has obvious uses but they literally had to invent sand portals to justify me even getting this one. 
---
WAYPOINT IF FULL DEAD!
---
I have RA and have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Was waiting for finally someone to post about this. Absolutely ridiculous time gating, especially in addition to the fact that light of deldrimor is ridiculously expensive you might as well just buy a new set of stat selectable gear
---
Unfortunately it's random.
---
You will always get green as your last for the reward and PoI, though.
---
As an aside... how does our (new, especially) mastery even work once we're done with the episode, storywise? Maybe we should just ignore it as game mechanics, hehe.
---
Wait, when do you talk to Rytlock after Aurene's death? I just remember the instance closing after the final bit.
---
&gt;[no spoilers] " I finished Ep. 5. I'm in mourning!"

...
---
Open world but every event spawns dhuum cm
---
... that i wont get arthritis from spamclicking because i can use an autoclicker?
---
remember they may not be able to tell especially if IP is spoofed.  And also remember you can have multiple users in same ip on different computers too
---
Just checked and my real IP address matches with what GW thinks it is. So no big deal.
---
Thanks.
---
What does “your headcanon” have to do with any of this 
---
You couldn't handle the spooky forest 
---
How do you manage your gameplay?  I don't have it but other issues and always looking to learn
---
Not to forget that you need laurels in order to obtain a part of the set of ascended Diviner's trinkets rather than lots of map-specific currency.
---
It's a pity that there is only backpack skin. It should be a glider as well.
---
If you want to experience more friendly dredge in core maps, go to the following locations:
---
1) Sorrow's Embrace dungeon's explorable mode where you see a conclusion to War Minister Shukov's story from the story mode (where he originally retreated swearing to return) and witnessing friendly dredge Rasolov and Koptev beginning a revolution against Shukov and his cabinet.
---
2) Groznev Delve in Frostgorge Sound where a heart involves helping Rebel Isaak sowing the seeds of an even more large scale dredge revolution than what is seen in Sorrow's Embrace explorable mode.
---
Too bad this revolution didn't seem to do much given that the moletariate's corrupt leadership aligned with Scarlet a year later. I hope our three dredge revolutionary friends survived and weren't being sent to the gulags.
---
At least Varya's collective was friendly, so it gives me hope that we may see more pockets of friendly dredge living here and there in the fringes of dredge areas. It would be nice if we got more dredge joining the Pact just like we had other occasional enemies like grawl and ogres doing here and there after aiding them. :)
---
Fake news.  Kormir transformed the Realm of Torment into the Redeemed Realm.
---
As does arcdps and most programs even super simple ones.  Also if you expand program to include websites, dulfy, Wiki, and many others are all far more illegal.
---
That has always been the case, as long as you answer the whisper of a GM if they check on you, there is no problem
---
One more tip. Salvage immidately, but don't send materials to the bank. Open between 15-25 bags depending on how many items they give (looking at you, Bag of Gears...), salvage them immidately and watch everything stack on top of themselves. Then send them to material storage, once.
---
That doesn't really hold up though. "alapart" or any other variation doesn't exist but "altogether" is valid.
---
and opening a chest?  
---
You're welcome. Yes, he is a vocal chameleon but thankfully his whiskey bass voice does make him somewhat recognizable even when he does his best masking his voices (which tend to range from Spike Spiegel to Rytlock and Green Goblin from the Specular Spider-Man). 
---
Giving Mikhail a noticeable lisp was such a nice touch as was your example of Sergei, making both dredge memorable on the map just as Varya ended up being in the story. :)
---
[Frying's Pan](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Frying_Pan_(toy)) has a skill that spawns a [Roast Pig](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Roast_Pig) bonfire. 
---
suxon to be you, go soak your head OHWAIT
---
The human gods didn't leave specifically because of Kralkatorrik, they made the decision to leave long before that; before we even killed Mordremoth. And they didn't leave because they can't contest the Elder Dragons, they left because the cost of a war between the gods and the dragons might cause even more devastating circumstances than those we're already in.
---
I actually liked the city for what it was, but it definitely delivered on the ugly, overcrowded feel.
---
arcdps and TacO are completely different. One interacts with the game directly, the other does not.
---
In general, the reward structure in the new map is probably the weakest part of the update. There is too much complication and time-gating around the rewards to such an extent that I feel zero interest in working towards it. The same issue happened with both the last LS's armor and some of the armor sets in PoF. I have yet to finish my collections of any of the recent armor sets with PoF. I love having a reason to play, but gating it behind crafting and a new material tied exclusively to the new meta at a particularly low rate just doesn't appeal to me at all. 
---
I don't get why ArenaNet feels like they have to reinvent the wheel here: what was wrong with...  an account-bound currency that I earned by doing EVERYTHING in the new map and got in significant quantities? Heart of Thorns, to this day, has one of the best reward structures for new content around. I barely use any of the armor sets it gave us and yet I own all of them simply because of how fun and easy it was to unlock them just by playing. 
---
But PoF and the recent living stories seem to be aimed at involving the crafting system and it drives me fucking bananas. No, I don't want to have it tied behind a flat gold cost and materials that can only be earned in a very specific way. No, I don't want the entire process to revolve around the absurdly boring crafting system.
---
They build up and eventually auto open I believe.
---
I agree with you wholeheartedly.
---
The only thing I'm not sure about in this story is I do like the mists being an afterlife, and the connotations of it being the stuff between worlds.  It's interesting to me.  But not when those souls are so...active, in the story.  At least directly.  I know we don't see the souls directly, but Glint literally just being "Oh I died guess I have a ghost army now." just doesn't...feel right.
---
They do autoloot indeed.  After 4.
---
I am aware.  Was responding to user that if you apply that quote to Taco, then you must also apply it to a variety of other programs.  And that if you expand it to include websites, the quote applies there as well.  In other words that quote is not meant to applied that way.
---
Given the tooth on display in Nornville, the scale of Kralk in the PoF battle with Balthy, and description of Kralk in Edge of Destiny, I took it as implied that Kralk can change size. 
---
Worst time gate I can think of was the backpack for the sand swept aisles. 
---
Are you still offering people? If so I'd like to take you up on that offer. 
---
Ah, my bad I misunderstood your meaning. We are in complete agreeance!
---
Clearly you didn't give enough of a skritt to take a closer look?
---
Tenno, while travelling through the void, you have wound up outside the solar coordinate system. This land seems strange and does not obey the normal laws of physics. I am picking up large amounts of unknown energy readings.
---
Be careful, Tenno, and do what it takes.
---
I indeed did not know this. Or that it applied to the login rewards.
---
I'm still learning multiboxing with new accounts.  And I must admit many days I don't bother because it takes time (even with launchbuddy) to log in, open chests, close.  But you can automate the launching itself?  Might I ask for more details how that can be done?  
---
And of course days happen where I am just too busy to even log in with my main account.  But I think that's yet another level to be able to schedule automated log in and closing of client.  
---
Anyway, if you do have any tips or ideas on how I might multibox better or more (without it taking so much time), I'd love to hear it.  And thank you!
---
:)
---
I think the story will continue in the mists and that Aurene will be just fine there. 
---
I could have written this reply myself, right down to the reasons I don't really use the beetle. It's annoying to have to wait to move only to boost into a tree or wall that didn't load.
---
Kaineng was to reflect poverty or how should I put, it had big contrast between porverty and the ppl in power that whilst being a very dense urban empire. The luxons were seafearers not exactly or  necessarily pirates which is associated with plundering and pillaging altho there were factionwars after the jade winds. I wouldn't also disclude them from not being relevant to the story, afterall Cantha was known as the empire of the dragon whilst also having a mythicallike dragon named Kuunavang.
---
The map just seems to have a lot of downtime betweeen meta-events.  Most of the time there's just nothing going on which makes me feel like I'm wasting my time so I just log out. 
---
The Karka attack on LA
---
The line of dialogue from Treehearne, “Here, at the end, I am glad that it's just you and me.”
---
The destruction of LA
---
Dude only has 2 laurels.  What a noob!!!!!!!!!!
---
I guess it's hard of me to think of Anet having issues with it.  You're not even doing a single macro in the game.  Not even opening a chest!  Just log in and out.  It doesn't give you any advantage over other players.  
---
But I completely respect and agree being sure as who wants to risk their valued accounts?  
---
If I might kind of poke you, though, I'd love to poke you to write them again.  It would be wonderful if you could share something like that in any form even if so very limited.
---
As for your shortcuts that you do use, if you don't feel safe describing them either, I understand and respect it.  But if you're okay with it, would like to know what shortcuts you do use.
---
i smell that taimi have in pocket dragon revive tool.
---
I have OA and it can certainly hurt to use some functions, and a macro can help a lot with certain things.
---
Though that one you only had to wait what, a week? Have you tried going for legendary armor?
---
Yes and no, for rough terain springer is better, you can just travel in straight line, no need for pathfinding, i have no problem with gryphon clunkyness... I didn't know it was clunky tbh :D 
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but is there any chasm jackal has adventage over gryphon other than w5?
---
Honestly it should just be removed entirely - while it's amusing at first it quickly loses its charm:
---
* It makes slopes annoying to navigate, which isn't really interesting: at the start of 100 for example, it's awful trying to get everyone to safely land on the platform with the mistlock for prestacking.
---
* It totally ruins weapon skills that involve movement: it is very easy to miss with skills if you were moving even slightly in the wrong direction when you attempted to cast them. This is especially bad for skills which have a defensive component.
---
* It interacts very poorly with other instabilities: to use 100 as an example again, SA and slippery slope could well render prestacking impossible, and today's combination of slippery slope and sugar rush makes it incredibly easy to simply be chain-knocked off platforms.
---
I was genuinely concerned that half my group was going to quit mid-run due to this instability
---
Arguably you make substantially more from trading that extra hour of work for in game cash
---
I've never noticed his legs before but now I can't stop looking
---
2 Accounts, Multiboxing. 
---
I mentioned that, 2 hidden chests per room, but you explained how to use the light correctly :) There is an achievement to find 50 chests that way too... so quite a lot of time will be spent in there. 
---
r/GW2mildlyinteresting
---
What's wrong with that? And you're fine with the males?
---
I'm just upset because since she was an egg, she's been my baby. I've watched her grow. I've trained with her. She wasn't ready. Even her brother who was older wasn't ready for just Balthazar.
---
This episode made me cry, so it's great for the writing to evoke that emotion, but I just want my baby back. 
---
;_;
---
Please don't pull a Cayde-6 and Uldren thing...
---
I just went through Source of Orr with my sylvari the other day. That was one the best lines. Then the music starts to play. Such a touching moment. Got me a bit misty eyed. 
---
Oh that's a good point. I was trying to think of consumables which didn't have a "Use All" option; because then according to the wording of the policy you should be allowed to use an auto-clicker on those, even though the game provides no option.
---
&gt;Ghosts can appear out of the mists, with agency, and fight things in the real world, as shown in the previous episode. Why is this possible? Who knows. The Shattered Observatory fractal suggested it wasn't possible for people in the mists to punch through to Tyria, but I guess that's not canon any more.
---
The Charr could only wish Ghosts couldn't affect things in the real world.
---
My grp laughed about it alot and we were all certain it would be a cluster fluff. I fell of the edge before making it to the mistlock, one person just slide right past it, we skipped the pre-boon for SKorvlad. Game lady was pretty much the same outside of catching the balls, it was really ez to miss the aoe by just sliding out and then not being able to get back in fast enough. Arkk was again not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I think it went smoother because we were all so prepared for how bad it would be that we compensated well.
---
I personally think the converstation at anet when something like "They think SA is bad!?!? I'll show them what a really terrible instability is!" now just imagine Ark with the slip and slide with the new SA.... I cant wait to try it.
---
Just a side note about the new SA. You can totally troll your party members with it. When you push someone with and they bump into someone else they get pushed too. Also you can push ppl over edges and into AOE's. So there is that... its totally better than the old SA..... /s.
---
A R C D P S
---
Yeah but it shouldn't have ever been a thing. It's not something skillful either. 
---
On top of those, the developers' video talking about the addition of Sun's Refuge shortly before the release of episode 4 mentioned how the second half was coming.  We had three episodes available at that point.  I expect one more to come before season 5?
---
 No kit holo build is my fav and has an easy rotaion. You use sword /shield or sword /gun
---
From core-Mentor missions, enjoyed the racial missions, their purpose as our true friend worked well, and first character I got attached to so much that his/her death still makes me a bit emotional as well as seeing them as visions here and there in the story whenever they pop up.
---
From Season 1 (played a little bit of it due a stupid break I decided to take, been playing religiously since 2014 :P) The thing that stuck with me was helping Rox free the hatchery and meeting Frostbite. As a fan of robot characters I greatly enjoyed Job-o-tron storyline and consequently I find all the releases he appears in pretty cool (Southsun Cove missions, Queen's jubilee, and Escape/Battle of LA).
---
From Season 2 Defending the Pale Tree after she was badly injured by Shadow of the Dragon, playing as Caithe, and the reveal that Sylvari are in fact Dragon minions.
---
From Hot Enjoyed seeing Rytlock after he disappeared from Season 2, Eir's death was well done, and enjoy Dragon Stand.
---
From Season 3 Aurene hatching and the Balthazar reveal as well as fighting his honds inside a volcano that hosts Primordous.
---
From PoF Overall enjoyed the story whole very much, but a standout was when Balthazar sends us to the Domain of the Lost and reclaiming our identity by seeing basically a recap of our story start to finish.
---
From Season 4, that's though because I have enjoyed every episode in one way or another and I feel Anet has stepped up their game in story: rescuing Taimi from Joko, infiltrating an inquest base and meetting Blish and Gorrik, infiltrating Joko's fortress for a final confrontation with the lich, Dealing with a powered up Kralky and Seeing Eir again and Snaff fro the 1st time, each episode the different allies we recruit. The ending. Season 4 is on a roll!
---
I did this mission with a friend for the first time tonight. We were both playing human female toons, both the same height and i think body. During that scene our models overlaped and some parts were thier toons armor and others were mine, it was freaking and cool looking. I think its odd that part members have the same spawn point for that scene. And yes our minis were in the shot.
---
AFAIK it's the only way to get to the eagle shortcut
---
Ah okay, ty.  I think launchbuddy does that already.
---
I do hope you'll get something back from support.  Thanks again for the discussion and tips.
---
Can you explain what you mean by the end of your number 1
---
I forgot about that, hasnt joko died or been thought dead a bunch of times in lore? Maybe aurene picked up that bit of magic when she ate him. 
---
Someone make a minion summoning macro please.
---
I was gonna say the same thing.
---
Ah okay.  Thanks.
---
Same with the new SA. I like it because you can troll with it, but I really dislike shit that makes me lose control of my character.
---
I bind dodge to 'v'. It's just one press with spacebar. :)
---
While hoping it would drop for me in a busy map I ended up disconnecting. When I got back on I was on a new map. I still had the light buff, however it would only drop more purple plates no matter how many times I killed it or if I already had a purple plate on my back. 
---
whoosh
---
Thats third time i see this on reddit in one day xD
---
No... Sudoku is ritualistic Japanese suicide. Sorry if you got confused sweaty
---
Nothing Viable. This is just my lvl 35 storage character. Signets just because why not.
---
Been wanting to do some sketches but my tablet broke.  I loved this scene, too.
---
as soon as I got the "Honorary Skritt" title, it has never been removed. 
---
That's probably the coolest looking Asura I've yet seen. I was planning on making an Asura warrior and a Sylvari guardian... might swap those two now.
---
I wonder if a timed auto-clicker on the Candy Corn Gobbler is a gray area. 
---
Because it’s working 
---
No worries, she will WP
---
I believe it's because natives learn to speak before they learn to write, and since the words are pronounced the same, here comes their confusion. People who learn English as a second language usually learn to read and write first, so they see the difference right away.
---
A few people liked to multi-box ten accounts into the daily ATs and just AFK. It's hard to have fun in an AT when you have to wait 45 minutes for your first actual match &gt;.&gt;
---
Looks like a tiny Tom Bombadil 
---
Decided that making a new character is simply too tedious for my schedule right now. I have level 80 thief, necro, berserker and ranger. Which one should I use to play through PoF for HP, experience, mastery, unlocking new mounts and the new specialization... Thanks.
---
I could see that. I've never really looked into what the other types of arthritis are, until today. I've only really know about how RA works. Most of the time movement helps my joints, unless it flares up.
---

---
I don't recommend arcdps
---
Taco is very usefull too.
---
few days after they announce it
---
Jewel should have been a craft for the jewelers to make with map mats. This is just annoying to do
---
It's basically the crippled/walk animations mashed together.
---
Does this mean stacking candy corn gobbler boosts with autoclicker is fine?
---
We probably gonna kill kralk in the mists anyway since his magic cant flood tyria if he dies in the mists
---
Yeah, I know that. Never appeared on my back. Same for multiple others who were in the room with me at the time.
---
Difficulty wise it was not a problem at all. Doubt any regular 100cm players will have trouble. Annoying as fuck? Yup.
---
meta battle would tell you it's also a meta https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Holosmith_-_Protection_Holo
---
If I remember right I think it's a gemstore item.
---
It's a bit more than a guide on top of the game, because guides don't use an API to get your location.
---
I think it would be more precise to compare it to having a friend sitting beside you and telling you at all times where to go and what to do. It still sounds fine.
---
I think we will find a way to return her in the next expansion...probably right at the end of it.
---
So does this program called chrome that allows us to open the wiki or youtube guides.
---
Don't have to pull it out of what it means. Taco doesn't interact with the game itself but the API, it is just an overlay over the game. They could just disable it if they had trouble with it since it is really only used for such stuff at this point.
---
I can already hear rip &amp; tear in the background
---
I've been stuck at 32k for so long now. Kind of sucks that I wasn't able to do season 1 when it was available. 
---
Pretty much the entirety of episode five. 
---
We are hit with a whammy by telling us that Lazarus was actually Balthazar and then he steals Omadd's machine to try to kill Primordus because he can. So we fight his dogs in the caldera of the biggest volcano on the planet while Primordus watches, because he's simply too powerful to give a shit about us being there and his dogs haven't eaten in a while.
---
And during the entire fight, we hear the first music of the next expansion. Absolutely epic.
---
You mean, like the Communal Boost Bonfire, except without the boost effects, and just a pile of burning sticks on the ground ?
---
This happened for me too yesterday, I got sent into the graveling room and then no plate appeared for me to pick up from it.
---
&gt;You may bind dodge and jump to a single key.
---
For everyone who told me that this is bannable before. HA-HA-HA!
---
Same, killed the vet 5 times just now and no plate dropped. Only time it dropped for me is when i was doing the story
---
Yolo Mouse! 
---
Arc has a built in delay with its templates if used anywhere outside of the raid lobby, hubs, or cities so that it directly avoids the above concern.
---
Im gonna need a forward clip now. (yes I could just log in to an asura, but none of mine look similar enough for comparison)
---
At first glance this appears better than the normal forward run..
---
That is what one (very) young 'god' told us. There may be more reasons for their exit, e.g. fear of their own possible demise, she didn't know herself or wasn't told ny the others.
---
I think they hired Martins to write this episode.
---
The whole jungle-- or at least all those corrupted plants-- was literally all a part of Mordremoths body. The mouth was an avatar he used to battle with and consume ley energy. The locus of his power however was that huge tree. It was where his mind was. If we blew up the tree the mind could simply move to any other region of the Body and establish a new locus - the location there was just very convenient for him.
---
They are skipping update 3, and will post update 4 when they have enough words typed for the post, will probably come with next LW Season, and will have no information regarding Alliances.
---
Aurene ate Joko and kept his nastiness contained so that when kralk ate her it would be released and poison kralk from the inside.
---
Put her into a golem. Put them all into golems. 
---
I agree
---
What? I don't even understand what's the deal...so you don't want an auto...what happens when u use all your other skills....do you just....wait?
---
Dang dude, that's pretty rough sounding. Have you ever tried one of the MMO mouses that have like 30 buttons by your thumb? I'd say try one of those if your thumb is functional enough.
---
There seems to be more of a push to make video games more accessible, at least by microsoft. I've never been a huge Xbox fan, but their [adaptive controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEKIAHrugZ4) looks awesome, and some version of it is probably in my future.
---
Medicine is pretty close to there, just not quite to the chopping off your arms there. Hopefully for your sake it advances really quickly. I fully intend to ditch my legs too, just give me the full Skywalker treatment and make me more machine than man.
---
I hope you keep finding ways to do what you love. Taimi would want that.
---
I also don't think it was worth a full removal, but you gotta admit that a throwaway account does give a very bad vibe... And he didn't help his case by calling those who opposed his opinion "delusional fanboy" or that he was "holding the truth". He may have put lots of effort, he was not seemingly interested in a discussion. 
---
You're totally right. I can't believe I missed that. Thank you. 
---
and if i recall he made it so you cant swap templates in combat and has a greater time period to swap while in wvw/pvp
---
I said it before and I say it again: Anet just pushed themselves into a corner this time.
---
Here where I live there used to be a radio novel about a psychic super hero; one episode they put him in this horrible situation where his powers couldn't save him and he was surounded and pretty much doomed. The writter left the episode in a cliffhanger and then the dude couldn't figure out how to continue. He just dropped the thing and made him get out of the predicament in the most mundane way possible to continue with the story, to everyone's dissapointment.
---
I feel they're over using death and defeat way too often to end the episodes and instead of shicking me or making me emotional it's driving me frustrated because this whole Kralkatorik plot line is dragging on too much in my opinion, and because I really feel they'll need to pull a big deus ex in order to present a solution.
---
I'm already expecting more failure to come to the hands of the commander and more important NPC deaths, I just sigh now...
---
I don't quite get what you want to say. Either you have autoattack on skill 1 or you don't, but you do not seem to like either option. What else is there? And, do you know that you can change which skill is on autoattack? It doesn't need to be the first one.
---
Want to know more, please explain.
---
He's making an argument against TacO. Arguing against TacO by using examples of things that TacO *doesn't even do* is a strawman at best, and probably arguing in bad faith.
---
&gt; activate Joko’s Lich powers in Aurene
---
Hadn't thought about that, but it might just happen by itself and not need an activator, since she has been shown to easily absorb magic.
---
Yes which is why we killed the mind, trapping the "body" in the mouth and ending both facets of Mordremoth's existence.
---
Hi, it's me, the other person. I just want my Diviner stats change :(
---
https://sf.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aeauj2/if_your_guild_hall_has_the_fractal_console_you/
---
Nope. You can jump up tree using normal jumps
---
In both expansions, but probably more frequently in Heart of Thorns, people do "HP trains" where groups of players hunt down hero points together. Check the LFG every now and again to see if they're happening. 
---
I play mesmer and I find both quite solo-friendly, but the mirage is possibly easier to start with as chrono has to time blocks whereas mirage can mash evade more successfully. 
---
But we killed a dragon
---
Why thanks alot :3
---
Probably need ep 6 for epilogue to the next expansion if they are making one, or we just go into another LW season :/
---
Their wvw update is taking forever tbh

Imo taco is no different to having a YouTube video up on your second screen.

it's gemstore.
---
Condolences friend. 
---
What happened to her flower at the end
---
I would like Razah to be the guide
---
Jackal in the beginning but since I've got Shrine skin it loads faster than any remaining mount with default skin which is quite helpful (no idea tho why that happens). Now it's skimmer because of its movement nature.
---
As an other redditor said, Vekk (and the Asuras) in GW1 made me fall in love instantly. The whole Mayan theme, little arrogant geniuses that can don't let their size stop them, inventors... There is a lot of personality into play here. I just love the idea of creatures having really grandiose ideas which often turns into catastrophe.
---
Then there is the aesthetics. They're unique. Sharp teeth, long ears, big eyes, originally albinos since they preferred underground areas, weird feet, golems... And the goofy animations. Oh god my character is as clumsy as I when he moves. 
---
I was a bit bummed when GW2 showed that they became more sci-fi and cute, I preferred the tame ugly goblin from GW1, but it grew on me anyway and I had options for less cute characters. I'm also a bit annoyed I can't stay in my exo-suit forever like a true Asura. Still hoping for a tonic... And more racial armors.
---
I've been sticking with my main Asura since betas and I'm still in love. I adore my little guy. 
---
It is only 5 people however on most bosses if you are in the same group as the Druid they will have a warhorn so you won't have to worry about swiftness+fury generation. With that only the other sub group will have to use the banner every once in a while if you don't take stuff like Rune of the Pack.
---
What I'm saying is that I don't like how skill 1 is an auto attack taking up a skill slot  
---
If you don't have auto attack on skill 1 it is basically useless and you have to spam the button
---
Since some longbow skills track in stealth (ranger rapid fire for example) i really hope this doesnt appear there. Can someone test it? Might be really gamebreaking.
---
Nope, a dragon killed a dragon
---
You failed to deliver your rant... 
---
At no point in your rambling, incoherent post, were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
---
And the ghosts gossip. The Mists don't forget. The one time where you accidentally your legionnaire's armour? The Mists remember. That incident causing you to be banned from the Serrated Blade for three days? *They know!*
---
Holosmith was the sword, Scrapper was hammer. To add to this you also have access to the Caladbolg line of weapons, of which include a Sword and Greatsword. May uave minor crafting requirements (which honestly can be bypassed with certain collections rewarding materials like Vision Crystals) and come stat selectable *and* can be re-rolled at practically any time (and multiples made if you have alts that did the HoT story).
---
no u
---
Why not copy some stuff from Dulfy, she's got everything up and running hue hue hue
---
well a good skill design would be that you are active throughout the fight but avoid flimsy combat approaches like spamming a single attack
---
Ok is this actually a problem, or are people just being lazy?  If you enter the room (NOT during the story progression) and the graveling is spawned, likely in combat, defeating it will NOT award you the plate, regardless of if you damaged it.  If you want the plate, you must check the sarcophagus while the graveling is not around/ therefore you cause it to spawn.  Once defeated, then you will be awarded the plate.  I've done this on multiple characters and never had an issue.
---
It's a specific example to disprove an argument frequently brought up in TacO's defense. That's not remotely a strawman.
---
its the wizard hat its 200 gems
---
We are going straight into season 5 from season 4.
---
What the fuck where they thinking? Its such an obnoxious and unnecessary thing to have
---
&gt; They've already redone their Chrono gear *multiple* times in the past 6 months, and ANet comes along and drops Serpentine Jewels on them.
---
This is the crux of the issue for me. I was legitimately pumped for this update, and waited for like a month to re-gear my Chrono after hearing rumors about Diviner stats, and now I can swap like maybe one piece per day? And sometimes (like today) not even that because the damn graveling is bugged and not allowing progress in the treasure rooms? I'd honestly even be sorta ok with it if the bug didn't exist, but now I have no guaranteed drops of this shit item on any given day. I don't have to do the metas, but hey I can throw 10 gold at the trading post for a lottery chance at not having the bug show up for me. This is practically leadership runes (pre noxious pod buffs) all over again.
---
A relog just fixed it for me.
---
200 Gems, just coming 
---
Well, there were two dragons - One of them is still alive, and the other one was pierced by Kral's crystal spears.
---
So unless I didn't gain the ability to create and throw branded spears within the last few minutes, I definitely didn't kill a dragon
---
I have this for my 4 accounts. 3 account shortcuts use this command line, but my main account doesn't as it's opened via rich discord plugin thingy.
---
death to all asuras
---
Her death had no emotional impact on me because I knew it was temporary. They didn't kill her in a way which convinced me her story was done, it's painfully obvious there is more and so I can't see this moment in the story as anything other than going through the motions.
---
I genuinely don't understand how her death is supposed to have an emotional impact on us, the player, because it's so transparently temporary. If we had actually completed our mission and tied up the expectations of what to do with Aurene, and her death was a sacrifice to accomplish something rather than a a bad result from a fight, I might believe it and be able to have an emotional reaction. Instead it wasn't convincing at all and it just feels like some kind of magic story explanation will happen and she's back after they invested an entire episode in faking her death, which frankly sucks imo.
---
I also just don't believe Aurene is gone when we had an expansion that was mechanically about mounts and narratively about bonding with a dragon, but not a single time did they actually allows us (even if just in a story instance) to use the dragon as a mount. It makes 0 sense as a game designer to not do that and they are obviously saving it for the finale (maybe it's the final mastery for season 4, at least it will be in a story instance). It makes more sense to take down Kralkatorrik flying on Aurene's back rather than doing some clumsy special action key mechanic and relying on ley lines.
---
Aurene's death wasn't believable narratively or mechanically, and so the impact of that moment in the story wasn't there for a lot of people.
---
I would argue Aurene's the worst attempt to exploit this that the writers have made. They've been going hard for two seasons and an expansion at making our character (and players themselves) personally invested in a relationship with Aurene. To try and leverage that with a fake death that's so unconvincing is one of the worst "emotional death for impact" moments they've done in GW2.
---
Season 5 it is. They stated on this a while ago : 
---
&gt; And so, onto the future. With  Season 4 reaching its conclusion and the promise of a huge finale for  players, what can be expected from Season 5? Well, there's the promise  of even more significant content, including things that would usually be  saved for an expansion, as well as another "amazing story" that will  immediately kick off right from the conclusion of Season 4 and take them  on a ride. 
---

---
Oops, mixed up elite specs. Thanks for correction.
---
The argument that TacO doesn't give an unfair advantage? If the goal is to show how its functions are unfair, it should be illustrated by disproving the fairness of those functions. It shouldn't be illustrated by saying "well what if there was an overlay that used machine learning". Because TacO doesn't use machine learning. It doesn't do anything remotely like any of what he described. This whole line of arguing is total horseshit. 95% of what TacO does is stuff you can get from the Wiki, presented in a somewhat more useable format. Tons of machine learning there, *for sure*.
---
&gt; Maybe she just does whatever Joko does. 
---
Necro here. I cast my vote for that Joko thing.. whatever it is.. 
---
Were you fighting it alone? We did it in a group yesterday and the plate kept dropping for me only until i left the room. It seems it always dropped, no idea how you make sure it is you though
---
Couldn't it be that there exists a real Dessa cum laboratory in the Fractals, but we can never be sure, unless we find it? The echoes in the fractals have a fractal nature themselves and there can be echoes of echoes, which makes it even more confusing to navigate that part, but given incredible luck, you might find the real people among the echoes. Or an echo of yourself, if you look hard enough.
---
&gt; Have some random spirit from the mists 
---
I wish they would have done more with Gwen instead of just using her as Glint's messenger.
---
(She could take down Kralk single-handedly. I saw what she did to Ascalon during the GW1 open beta ending.)
---
no personal responsibility, that is why we cant have nice things
---
&gt;That dragon has been impaled by crystal dragon-piercing spikes. Was anyone seen holding crystal dragon-piercing spikes at the time of the crime?
---
Whats multiboxing?
---
The daredevil spec that thief gets in PoF is pretty popular and good for open world. 
---
H xrs
---
Had you already done this in the same day or on the same character prior to that encounter?  I've heard that you are only able to do the tomb raiding once per day per character.  It makes sense because you only get the light of deldrimor halves from the two meta events once per day per character.
---
Nah. I'm over 30k I don't go out if my way too much for AP and I'm still not daily capped.
---
I do go back and get AP from stories, but I'm definitely not one of these people that sit in a story instance with a warhorn auto licking rats. I have just gathered them up, with a small effort of going back into areas to collect them.
---
 Nope, first time that reset. Never been in that specific room, too.
---
Yep i am in this boat. I spent a ton of time girding the freshwater pearls for minstrels, DS for Leadership runes, nupe - we changed SOI so now you can be in zerker/assassins. I too was excited for the new stat. It felt like a reward for the patience of having the chrono meta so drastically changed so many times in a year. NUPE grind all the things.
---
should probably have said in recent memory. the only other death i can think of is blish (who's more MI and presumed dead then confirmed dead)
---
I keep waiting for an undead branded mordrem Joko to return and be all, "I'm backkk, bitches!"
---
Honestly, it would be nice to see Razah and Koss talk to each other. They didn't get any interactions in the original game, so this is a good opportunity.
---
You're right that Razah would be good as a guide.
---
How I imagine Razah could be interpreted is that he finds the demonic environments of the Realm of Torment very normal to him. What the player finds unusual, Razah simply talks casually about. In fact, he even finds some parts of it very soothing to him.
---
&gt;Razah: "Although I was bound here, I have no resentment towards this place. The soft, pulsing light that permeates the land reminds me of the Mists."
---
I shall but.. what am I actually looking for?
---
Necro McNecroface
---
Well maybe it's bugged then? Fortunately I never came across that issue at the moment, but I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble.  You're sure you weren't on the story step where you have to go into that room?
---
You didn't need to click every few seconds if you chose to drink wintersday beverages, and not wintersday tonics. And even if you chose tonics, there was a workaround : you could spam the tonics if you were downed. I downed myself as a necro, and just spammed all the tonics I had.
---
This is a good point. I usually just watch Netflix on another screen as I manually click on the gobbler. Should be ok as long as the account is still attended to. Time to write an autoclicker! * flexes fingers *
---
It’s not a new mistake, but it’s one that’s generally made by native speakers, not by people learning English. Similar mistakes exist in other languages, too. For example, German has seid/seit, which are mixed up by native speakers all the time. 
---
&gt; Yes, it is an ancient trope that can be used well and for great effect.
---
I would say that we were in the part of the hero story where we tried something and failed. The next battle, if it follows the formula, will be Kralk's death.
---
With /sit or on a chair? Can I bring my own chair? Is that chair allowed to be an artifact from the Mists? 
---
i'm pretty sure the absurdity was kinda the point of his death because as far as i know anet thinks of joko as a joke (i'm not ok with that but i accept it for now)
---
Nah, it's more that the context doesn't fit thr quote
---
Excellently put. I have faith that Anet will give us the story in the way you describe, and I want those high stakes. &gt;:D
---
It's time for us to step up and do the impossible, or die trying. And at the very least, prove that we're worthy of saving. 
---
I mean it works on Scruffy Ver1 in the HoT story if you're fast enough after that one cutscene.
---
taimi will replace kralk
---
The problem with Aurene dying is that it basically means we've lost the war. There's four dragons left and all are hostile to Tyrian civilization. We need to kill them to survive, but their deaths are *also* world ending.
---
Caught between a rock and a hard place and our one out kicks the bucket? Game over.
---
While a story can certainly end on such a note, it is, actually, the end of Tyria and maybe Guild Wars *the franchise.* Any sequel would have to be a new story because Tyria at best is uninhabitable and at worst stops existing. Maybe it follows the Six to a new place?
---
No, Aurene is definitely coming back. My personal theory is she's going to be a god, and take the place of the Six in the Mists on top of supplanting one or more dragons.
---
However, I also hope that both your possibilities for the next... episode come to pass. There needs to be the grieving, just as there needs to be the effort to succeed without Aurene. I think ArenaNet should put the former into the Current Events, similar to how Caithe spoke to us between episodes, and then the episode proper can tackle Dragon's Watch trying to forge their own destiny now that all prophecy seems to have failed.
---
&gt; Has anyone else had issues with this bug?
---
Why? You want to start up a support group or something?
---
&gt;This has frequently been met with:
---
"They shouldn't bring her back! That would invalidate the death completely! That's bad writing!"  
---
  
---
I heard this on many occasions. In most cases those players weren't really worried but rather wanted to make their opinion or wishes more valuable and in place.  
---
I got this exact message yesterday, when I wrote a long post about why I personally believe Aurene will be back and I replied in a similar way.  
---
Throwing deaths everywhere won't make the story writing better. Good story writers don't need to depend on cheap death tricks when they need to make their readers experience some kind of emotions.  
---
This episode was an amazing example of how emotions can be drawn out of us.  
---
My favourite was when our bond with Aurene finally manifested on a whole different level.  
---
She willing to put herself infront Kralky's blasts every single time the  attack was directed at us and ultimatelly to see the impact Aurene had on other characters like Taimi and even our own realization (in real life) that she meant to us more than we thought.  
---
And let's not even start with all the willing branding, which adds soooo much more to delve into later on - of course, if she'll come back.  
---
She gave way more to us while being alive than she would give us with a permanent death.  
---
That's why I personally hope and believe that she'll be back.  
---
i find the idea of a mist map very dubious at best
---
I would be glad already, if the quest to make thie asc version would even work at all. It's the horror. But ye, besides that .. I agree with you.
---
Eh, I appreciate that she momentarily shut down that den of vipers. I still remember the amount of Ministers acting against Kryta for their own interests. Bah. Better have an Imperator than that.
---
I don't know if you watched any of Teapot erp or arp raid tournament, but you will see that they use build template there to try gain advantage over one another.
---
darnit canach, illegal gambling *and* murder
---
I don't see anything in that post that wasn't said previously. The main "guidelines" are still the same overly vague bullshit which, as already pointed out in the "forum", would ban not only arcdps and TacO but also voice comms. If we take "interact with the game" to mean the more sensible "directly interface with the game process during runtime" that still includes pretty much everything arcdps does, music macros, and at least those parts of reshaders which improve visual clarity or long-distance rendering.
---
TL;DR: their statement is so broad as to be completely meaningless, judge by actions not words.
---
I was also speechless just thinking what just happened, not moving for 5min looking into the void.
---
It was epic indeed
---
There is a story step where I have to go into that specific room? I've never been inside before.
---
I've heard about this a lot but i dont know how to it works exactly to think about it. Where does the concept of mind transferring come in? Also idk about the concept of 'good' elder dragon. The whole concept of elder dragons relies on their awakening being something similar to that of a natural disaster in our world, tsunami, earthquakes etc. No elder dragon is bad for the sake of being bad, they feed and consequently cause damage to the world, but thats not their intent. Its collateral damage. So Aurene becoming one with Kralk would mean that she herself has become an elder dragon, but not a 'good' one. But thats just my take on it. Your theory does sound pretty cool though!
---
Why do I suddenly get the urge to play Fable: The Lost Chapters?
---
Something about having Joko towering over me made me have a little hope
---
Yeah ir crossed my mind that jokos magic will have something to do with the next episode. Maybe she will be some unique form of awakened with the power to finish off krak. I don't think that's it by a long shot. 
---
I think you can search the nearby coffin again to respawn the graveling. I had to kill it maybe five times before the plate dropped. Not sure if a bug or intended behavior. 
---
i have interacted with the sarcophagus 15 times and never got a plate ever. i ended up having to portal to friend to get the end room
---
A feeling Caithe shares with Aurene btw. 
---
What about the farming path markers? They allow you to play *as if* you were more skilled (memory/map knowledge in this case) even though you are not.
---
Things like this are my favorite part of this game. Lol
---
There is also the fact that [Season 4 Portal Tome has 7 slots](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1042751382921637888), so with Sun's Refuge that's 6 episodes in total to go in there (since we didn't get any "bonus" Scroll this time :p).
---
Wasn't Aurene's death predictable as well? Was it boring? No?
---
Storytelling is not just about what happens, but how it happens. That's why some works will give you the ending in the first chapter, then tell the story of how it got to that point. This wouldn't work, if predictably automatically makes things boring.
---
Also, I'm fairly excited about the aftermath of that attack. While the casualties may be fairly low, Kralkatorrik is still out there. I expect Almorra and Logan to go after the weakened dragon, while we have to figure out how to prevent Tyria from crashing. 
---
I have so many revive orbs but even then...
---
Tonics were substantially cheaper, I had no idea they wouldn't have a consume all option until after as I was just buying the cheapest with buy orders to get enough, and I don't remember if I tried the downed drinking bug and it was still a lot of work or that the exploit become more well known after I got the achievement. Either way you're risking you're account though with their pretty draconian rules. 
---
I still feel bad for all the people that didn't use the apple bug on that stupid mastery and actually made 100 trips back and forth that's a couple hours of their lives they'll never get back.  
---
&gt; Just a quick doodle but hopefully I was able to set the mood
---
Oh, don't worry about that. The lighting, the colors (and the cute art style) are really great!
---
Probably not, but can't you just hold the button down?
---
Yes! This is what i mean, predictability does not equal a bad story. ESPECIALLY in this case. Also i totally agree with you there!
---
so it has never happened in the history of fiction that they predicted that failure was inevitable and then they succeed anyway against all odds? and it's not that that is a extremely common trope?
---
i meant i'd be locked up for suicidal tendencies and the murder of close friends.
---
Can't you place it in the book you can buy from the magic vendor for one gold? So you can save space? 
---
Oompa loompa doobaadyda
---
no I'm pretty sure thats that thing with numbers and boxes. I think he meant sepulchre 
---
I attempted this for a while tonight, and after nearly causing me to ragequit I'm 100% sure I completed it but got nothing. Until we hear something on either the criteria or a bug, I'll be putting this one on hold.
---
I accidentally picked the right one -- greatsword was pretty easy. Now I just need to farm 50+ map currency and three of those stupid jewels, the most annoying thing.
---
Can you? I was under the impression that that was so you could read the lore from the Chasing Tales tomes that you buy from the same vendor, I wasn't aware that they could be used to store the Vision items as well. Have you managed to put the Visions in?
---
They really can't win.
---
When there is nothing to "grind" for, people complain about the lack of repeatability and point the new maps. When there is people complain about it requiring too much grinding. 
---
I think you know what you want to do - you've thought it through and you have a beautiful story behind it! Also, the new name sounds better for a character's name (at least in my opinion).
---
It’s a different item every weapon, you don’t have to pay that addition cost unless you want to craft the same asc heroic Dragonsblood weapon twicez
---
It's not that bad, if you were to look at crafting costs for ascended weapons you'd see they are between 40 and 70 gold depending on the Stats it comes with. 50 gold is not unreasonable at all.
---
I thought about the mind transfer thingie because iirc when Destiny's Edge fought Kralky, Snaff had some kind of mental battle against him(probably similar to the one we had with Mordy maybe?) before dying. Maybe seeing as she can't win by force she made a final attempt at trying to brand Kralky and she partially succeeded(the light blue crystals on Kralkys face).
---
It's not that necro itself is Bad, there are simply other classes that can fill it's roles better. also they're pretty damn strong in PvP.
---
I've been a decently active player since launch and I STILL find new things regularly. Last week while puttering around Queensdale, occupying my time until the new patch, I found a staircase I didn't recognize right outside the front gate. I climbed it and was rewarded with an adorable little scene of two kids playing tag around a treehouse while an elderly woman enjoyed the view of the dam and the river. It was sweet and new and has probably been there since the beginning and I just never saw it. I absolutely love that this can still happen to me in this game. 
---
Bonus: a few weeks before that in the same map (while key farming) I stumbled across a small scene with a lady whose picnic had just been stolen by a bear. It was adorable and I saved her lunch. 
---
honestly it's why I stopped main a squishy thief and instead boosted a necro to continue the HoT story
---
I love the skin but I know I basically can't get it in years as I didnt play almost at all during original LS1 etc.  and have no even half of the possible dailies.
---
I hate dailies, they're boring and feel like a job I have to do. I generally dislike DAILY and time gated things in games, it is supposed to "force" you to play every day or you will miss out, it's a "how to addict a player" system and I don't support it. 
---
I like achievements without time gate - do them when you feel like it, it's never too late. That's how all achievements should be.
---
Am I somewhat a "worse" player if I prefer to play at weekends for 8-9h rather than every day for 1-2 hours? That's how my free time turns out.
---
xD
---
It was downright annoying during Skorvald. After that it was just a nuisance. That being said I still 100% believe they never bothered playtesting this instability and just added it because they thought it'd be funny. 
---
As others have said you lose control of your character in a game where positioning supposedly is meant to be a huge deal. The instability extends the duration of stability applied to you, but that seems pointless since stability doesn't negate the sliding effect.
---
Worst of all is how they 'coincidentally' discovered that it was a 'bug' the instability was applied to Underground Facility and Cliffside on the day those two were on the fractal rotation. What about Uncategorised and possibly also Chaos? Have fun sliding around when jumping on the platforms I guess. 
---
I did have this obscure thought when Kralkatorrik just decided to leave.
---
To be fair, there's boring grind and there's fun grind. And that's also pretty subjective.
---
And there are people who enjoy grind and those who loathe it.
---
It's not like there's this single group entity who have both arguments, it's different people.
---
But how did Aurene  get the ability to do that? It sounds cool af but i think itd be difficult for the devs to explain it that well to players who havent read the novels of played HoT.
---
Whaaaaaat!?! I never knew about that. Well i hope theyve changed their mind cause i really want Cantha xD
---
I guess this kind of fits the theme in glints lair. They mention reforming crystals
---
I think Rox wants to stay with the Ohmawhatyoucallthem.
---
This is an awesome story :D IMO some of the best moments in MMOs come from exploration and personal goals without just rushing from A to B.
---
PS. I agree - your screenshot is cute :) 
---
This is the first living story episode where you can't get the achievement skin ( Corsair Trousers in this instance)  from the reward chest in WvW( or Per v Pee ?) ,this is disappointing as I have no interest what so ever in chasing achievements,  never have never will. 
---
Nah the whole instance wouldnt be on the ship. It would be more the starter mission of PoF, only it would be a lot more tense and we wouldnt get to go so far into the region straight away. I feel like theyve hyped up the 'Cantha closed its borders centuries ago' so much that if we just arrive there with no conflict i would be disappointed.
---
Not quite, the TacO markers actively respond to *your* actions which puts them above even a full path guide video. The ones for Guild Bounties are quite dumb but try doing a Guild Rush without anyone clearing the hostiles, that second you spend looking at the other screen can end your run.
---
Otherwise, what's wrong with synchronised multiboxing? A [professional competitive gamer](https://youtu.be/HRsDAX8DfBw?t=780) could *easily* operate 2-3 separate GW2 instances side-by-side so you're only making available what already is humanly possible.
---
I want Joko to come back as DRAGON JOKO now that Aurene is dead.
---
that is still irrelevant. A prediction can be right just as often as it can be wrong. In this case, Aurene's prediction became reality. 
---
Something I've changed in the past years, don't do everything everyday, you will enjoy the game a lot more if you play the longterm instead of rushing everything and grindind all the weapons/armors/etc...
---
I dont think it would feel rushed at all considering hes been one of the main antagonists since PoF. But to each their own i guess. The end of this season should mean a clear distinction between the stories of this season and the next. If season 4 and season 5 both deal with kralkatorrik we might as well have a season 4 with 12 episodes so people wouldnt be confused.
---
Do you actually play WvW? If you do, howmuch and how do you play it? I'm really wondering here. 
---
You keep on talking about roleplay ideas while you have no clue how this affects WvW behavior or gameplay. This is a problem, and hte reason most people here dismiss your ideas and say "plz no". 
---
Take secret tunnels. Every single EB keep has secret tunnels to get in. All of them. Half the PvE plebs don't even know about them because they DO NOT FUNCTION. Because even when commanders - the ones that know what they're doing and actually can attack keeps - attack these objectives, they know not to use the "secret tunnels" more often than not. 
---
These tunnels have limited space and are massive chokes. That makes them super easy to defend with just siege, meaning you most likely won't get in. 
---
So there are "tunnels" to get into eb keeps but... nobody uses them becuase while they're great for roleplay, they only work when the keep isn't upgraded to T3. And that never happens unless one side is getting slaughtered... Because of how OP T3 keeps are.
---
Adding tunnels doesn't fix the issue, or make it better, or even do much... And if you want those tunnels to be relevant and used, you still need to nerf T3 keeps.
---
T3 sm is the biggest reason you karma train in circles without fighting enemies all day... But here you are suggesting various changes to make sure you keep karma training in circles because you don't have the slighest clue about WvW. 
---
Please stop improving WvW by adding elements that make the gameplay worse. You need to - as the user above you literally stated - promote interaction between players and groups. Give them healthy objectives to fight over. 
---
PS. You say more nerfing but outside of the AC nerf, defenders have gotten massive buffs since the coer game (where fighting in objectives was obviously much more common - because you could get in without already steamrolling your enemies) 
---
She was in PoF
---
Reaper is pretty ass in raids and fractals though which is most of the pve group content
---
i think this is not allowed with the new policies....
---
Anet gave the winning team 2000 gems right, which shows they do care about it. And do you think it is fair if one team use template and the other not in such a competitive environment?
---
Order of Shadows would be the best bet I guess. I can't imagine thief being in the Priory or the Vigil.
---
depends on what character you've given her.
---
but i'd soy the order of whimpers
---
Are there any restrictions on farming the currencies like there are with Bloodstone/Petrified Stumps? Just so I can focus on learning the routes of actual time-gated ones. 
---
Currently this mob has
---
1. A chance to drop the plate (its not 100%)
---
2. and it randomly distributes one (1) plate to one person of the people attacking it
---
------------------
---
Long and soulcrushing tests show the following:
---
- Last hitting doesnt matter
---
- Being the one who activates the sarcophagus doesnt matter
---
I actually like Ashes of Mallory; it has a feel of Lady Stoneheart from GoT and is reminiscent of the Ritualist skills from GW1 (Vengeful Was Khanhei, etc). I have also recently started enjoying descriptive names so it's really just my own opinion here lol
---
Fair
---
Condi damage, banners, playable on 16/19 bosses as meta or less, not recommended in fractals, eats open world, everything burns.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Holosmith_-_Static_Sword/Shield i see at least 2 turrets in this one, you could add more
---
I had to kill the thing like 8 times to get my plate from it... which was green. So I think there's either a random element to the plates you get or just a lot of combinations available. 
---
Thanks. With axe if you have a necro you could, probably go all self-condi and yolo into a group of mobs after you're at 10%. It feels very weird though, like if they originally meant "get down to below 10%, (maybe heal up), kill 5 enemies within 5 minutes".
---
Even weirder: for mace
---
Defeat 60 enemies while wielding a mace and a shield in Thunderhead Peaks.
---
Fully equipped, Mouglon was nigh unstoppable.
---
Like, not just mace but explicitly a freaking shield as well. *triggered frog*
---
But of course it's totally up to you, read some stuff about all of these orders and choose whatever is the best suit for you.
---
For me personally it's just better and faster than the jackal unless it's a steep uphill. I don't care much for the jackal, bought it just so I can say I unlocked all the mounts, didn't really want it
---
Priory, if you want to hang around with one more sylvari
---
Depends on what you want the story of your character to be. Are they a stereotypical “spy” type thief who goes undercover, than order of whispers. If they are some kind of spelunking adventurer kind of thief, maybe the durians priory. Or maybe they are a badass kill everyone special units thief, then the vigil would be good. Overall it doesn’t have too many consequences outside the story immediately after choosing so I’d say it’s mostly for head canon.
---
Thank you!  
---
Opinions is what I want, I appreciate it.
---
Not saying it excludes it, im saying that id much rather have 100% might, fury, regeneration, protection, 5 man res through spirit, entangle for mechanics, vuln from storm etc. Than a scourge that gives barriers, some might and some regen and ressing abilities. Support scourge is nice if you are playing with bunch of monkeys that down 24/7, but if you want to run a 2nd support healer is usually just much better due to its utility
---
&gt; Especially for chronos, who have a dedicated rotation and calculate their boon duration very closely to achieve best goal. 
---
In the current state you don't need very little boon duration for min-maxed groups. Diviners is min-maxing DPS of your supports for speed runs. There's absolutely no issue with doing zerk chrono or previously geared chronos including commander / minstrel pieces. In fact - full diviner is a huge DPS loss (due to a significant lack of crit) over a diviner / zerk mix. So even if you need boon duration - you don't want full diviner but suffice with a few trinkets.
---
Lets be honest here - if your chrono is GOOD you don't need diviner, especially not full diviner, and if your chrono is BAD then your DPS is the last of your worries. 
---
Even if you want to push for "min/max dps at 100% boon duration" I suggest waiting for optimized builds. Wouldn't be suprised if its not full diviner and again adds leadership / concentration / ... especially on classes that don't get free additional crit (e.g. no firebrand with +60% crit from radiance). 
---
Trinkets are trivial from raids / fractals / pvp / wvw (+15g for wvw) and can be reset if you have them already. Also LS4 presumably (i heard buggy from LS3 currently because lul).
---
&gt; People have no problem playing the content to farm materials to achieve these goals, they have a problem with randomness and timegated content. I bet there wouldn't event be a backslach if you could farm a stuff for 3 full days (let's say 20\~30 hours), and have all you need. 
---
And I'm saying people overreact because it currently takes 30 DAYS MINIMUM (!!!) for 6 celestial pieces (armor only) to stat swap. +5 days per weapon because why the fuck not. 
---
So why is there backlash now? 3 full days, 20-30 hours? I mean it's not like it's new - as i repeatedly shown above- 
---
It takes farming DRYTOP for nomad stats. Goodluck with that shit. Hell you even need all them shitty fucking recipes. Same with silverwastes and sinister. 
---
Minstrel costed more than 200g, at the start of HoT almost 400g to STAT SWAP (!). That's absurd! 
---
The backlash isn't there because it takes a little while to get certain gear stats. That's already the case for plenty of stats. T**he backlash is there because many people BELIEVE these are now meta chrono stats for PvE.** 
---
And while i'm certain that they are great for that purpose, I think "full diviner" is not. In fact i'm pretty sure you don't need any diviner armor for a minmaxed chrono builds. So as I was saying, the issue exists but it's heavily exaggerated just because "muh chrono" and because "muh pve".
---
**If diviner stats weren't believed to be a meta stat for Pve, nobody would bat an eye. Because I don't see anyone complaining about the 5 day (!) time gate PER PIECE for celestial, or plenty of other stats.** 
---
Didn't she say that they leave because they don't want to take sides again? They left while Balthazar was still on his crusade to kill Kralk. Kralkatorrik himself was not really the mist-walking, reality destroying beast he is right now. This only happened because we killed Balthazar and Aurene/Kralk absorbed the mist walker magic from him.
---
But I don't remember exactly her words... So I may be wrong on that. But I think her main reason was, the last time the gods were fighting one of their own (Abaddon) they destroyed almost half a continent in the process. And they didn't want to repeat that.
---
By the way... Fun fact to that. Balthazar didn't had access to his full power when we killed him. And even that would have been enough to destroy half of Elona if Kralk and Aurene didn't absorb the magic. As seen by the bloodstone explosion in LW3. It was stated, that the magical explosion would have reached DR. Abaddon was also not the only incident of an powerful person dying what resulted in an cataclysmic event. When Shiro was killed, his magic destroyed half of Cantha.
---
Try using the Dragonsblood spears (special action skill) when doing Thunderhead Keep meta. Get low enough then one shot the mobs with the spears.
---
I just wished the AP system would get a rework. Better rewards that reflect the current economy and put everyone on the same playing field, even if that means awarding instantly to new players 2k or whatever AP. Obv they can re-implement some of the content where the AP is locked :) 
---
Doesn't make sense having an AP system if you can't play on a fair ground against other players just because you got late to the party. 
---
I'm nearing 20K myself, expecting once I finish the raids tab and some other easy AP + the remaining 9K I have on dailies to get to 30K by the end of this year but after that I will have to start the grind. 
---

I guess this is the important "change/update"?
---
Where is a hole with enough hyenas to kill a lvl80?
---
I don't git, if you are not interested whats all the disappointment about?
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I have killed the elemental. chasing tales storm's eye achievement is completed for me. got the ap for it but it didn't trigger as completed in chasing tales: asaliea the channeler achievement (deed#3). so right now I'm stuck ;/
---
arenanet find always weird way to put new stats in game...
---
Oh the "should of" is killing me. As a non-native speaker it's such a glaring mistake, and yet so common in native speakers' writing.
---
***Pure*** turret builds dont function very well outside of world bosses, farming (for example Istan), or general openworld shenanigans. Generally speaking 2 turrets and a flamethrower tend to be a lot better from a non-raid non-fractal PvE perspective, though you could swap flamethrower for the wrench to repair your turrets.
---
In Fractals/Raids the only turret that gets some use is the Rifle Turret, as the toolbelt skill is independent of the turret itself (so second casting the turret blows it up, not the toolbelt skill) so some engies would drop their turret for some slight extra damage while retaining the toolbelt bullet attack).
---
Pretty much my experience today
---
I've done the key thing one time so far and I luckily havent had that issue. First I thought I got the same plate (had orange first) then I noticed it was the yellow room next to it. Since the symbols and color look almost the same.  
---
Ive heard people are having an issue with the purple room waiting forever to get a new plate there when other players come in there aswell. Guess its not the only issue there. \^\^
---
Hey! I’ve finished crafting the Heroic Dragonsblood Axe, and thought I could give some tips on how I got those achievements.
---
Killing enemies was simple: I ran around killing enemies while progressing my daily hearts and eventually got it without issue
---
Killing enemies while below 10%: I simply used a Reaper. I spammed my corruption abilities (blood is power, corrupt boon) to give myself conditions and lower myself to below 10% hp. I then entered Shroud, and proceeded to kill 5 enemies. Very easy to do.
---
Hope that helps! 
---
I remember a cutscene where my mini choya mocked a crying caithe
---
Season 2 pretty much belongs to HoT and some achievements like that special armor from silverwastes needs this season (as far as i remember ) to complete it. Also explains a bit more of the story, soif you are story interested I'd suggest to get all seasons. HoT PoF... Living world 2 , 3 and 4. They all have some achievements / features.. points to get etc.
---
Recommended Boon Duration on Chrono - I've been out of the game for a good few weeks and logged in to start the new LW chapter. regarding the SoI change, how much BD is now thought to be optimal? Should we still be aiming for 100%? 
---
I play mainly PvE for now but will start getting into Fractals as soon as I've completed the new chapter.
---
Also, I see theres a new stat combo, Diviners...any Chronos using that? The volitile magic vendor by the forge in Thunderhead Peaks sells Dagnars Badge...expensive but the stats look awesome?
---
Swiggity swiolets

I say more violets

Swiggity swiolence

Exactly, it was definitely not a joke. I bet that the WvW devs just wanted to share what they (or rather he/she) have done so far but probably the PR management decided to remove the post for unknown reason.

When I got the message that the egg was cracking I got so excited I rushed to AB. /map hey anyone remember where the egg room was? I forgot... no reason I'm asking everything is fine, just fine.
---
I got in there and I wasn't geared right for the fight because I was still in my raid chrono gear (a mistake I made for Bath's fight as well dragging that out to a 45 min ordeal) So juggling all the guys who were trying to get at the egg was hard since I was basically an unkillable tickle machine. I also didn't know about the bomb mechanic so I was trying to figure that out. At the end her shield just had a sliver of health left, but I desperately defended her and Aurene was born.
---
Also that time I got Carin from my downed state when I was the only one left alive. I felt like a super hero!
---
Isn't dragon effective against dragon anyways in Pokemon? ;)
---
Not really random NPCs, a very few specific NPCs have special dialogues for Whispers members.
---
I think there are a few NPC dialogues for Priory members too, and I can't think of any for Vigil.
---
Anyhow ... those dialogues are very generic, they just add to the flavor of the character and not to the lore.
---
Also, I strongly recommend making 2 more characters in the future to play the other 2 Orders and fully enjoy all the story the game gives.

---
&gt;The wiki talks about BD and says there are some skills and traits that affect durations from specific sources that can exceed the cap, but doesn’t list which of those are able.
---
Herald's facet adds 20% (base) boon duration and can exceed the cap. This means it's an additive 20% boon duration which can exceed the cap. 
---
 If you have 100% on gear / traits / ... and a rev using the facet you'll have base boon duration x 2.2. If you have 0 boon duration except for the rev facet you'll have base boon duration x 1.2. 
---
There are some traits in the game which "increase the duration of boons applied by \[specific weapon\]" I think most of these aren't subject to boon duration (but i'm not 100% certain, you can test this in PvP if you want to be certain with leadership + harrier for 90% boon dura). An example would the trait for mace skills on guardian, which increases the duration of mace-applied boons by 33%. 
---
I believe the 33% increase to the boons applies to the base boon. In fact I think adding boon duration on top of the trait scales multiplicative with "regular" boon duration from concentration / gear / ... - this is quite unlike all other increases (herald, regular boon duration, ...) which are all additive. (So trait + 100% boon dura leads to x2.66 modifier rather than 2.33 modifier as would be the case for additive). Again - not 100% certain, but you can easily test. 
---
On the other hand all the traits which give "concentration" such as the staff trait obviously do count towards the regular cap. 
---
Really, just mix LS3 with LS4.  I love LS3 because it's so very solo friendly.  And that's one of my favorite things to repeat like bitterfrost.
---
Of course, I'm super low in the minority because most people just want giant zergs like Istan.  
---
So give us good solo content like LS3.  Make achievements and such all solo friendly as well.
---
Then, to take care of those who want grind and zerging, create Istan like zerg events.  Just make it profitable with a zerg and that's all most of them really want.  People can change between Istan and new ones for change of somethjing different.
---
And as for special materials and other things you need for collections, make them again available from solo as well as zerg.  That is equally available so you can play what you want, have fun, and get what you want.
---
As for timegating, I don't have too much opinion...because as long as it's fun, does it matter?  
---
Anet already announced that they're going straight from season 4 living world to season 5 without an expansion in between. If they're planning another expansion right after season 5, then I'd think July would be way too early to announce it. 
---
So either gay rox or shes converting to the Olmakahn
---
Im curious why she would think its hard to tell Braham about wanting to be Olmakahn though? He seems like hed be more then supportive of that...
---
So im leaning towards rox being gay (gaybies save the world!)
---
Yeah, the wrong one ...
---
This remembers me of my POF mastery tours.
---
I used to be spending hours on trying to get 1 hard to reach mastery point, so when someone asked in guild chat if someone could help I hosted a POF mastery tour with my mesmer and tagged up. It was time consuming but I loved seeing how much people appreciate it. :) 
---
it depends on your definition of "solo" content. I mean, dungeons and fractals aren't solo content, but if you count them as such then what stops you to say that, for instance, raids are solo content? 
---
Is istan farming solo content or not? You don't really have to interact with anyone, but you aren't doing it alone either.
---
If you have a higher ping you may need to fiddle with the delay between key presses. I’ve noticed that occassionally my ping will spike and my dodge jump wont work. That assumes you have consistently bad ping though, if your ping fluctuates a lot, often, you may have a hard time making a macro.
---
I joined a few of those a looong time ago to get reward track dungeon currencies for one of the lesser-frequented dungeons I just couldn't get a group for.

I felt dirty.  Like I was obviously cheating.  Got my gift of whatever and never did it again.

The match organisers were SUPER ban-happy too  - We're talking Tarir Multiloot commander levels.  If anyone put a foot out of place or even used a skill when on the "losing" team they'd be instant kicked and banned.

Somehow asura feels even more full of swag than normal  xD

---
Echoing what u/Tulki said in their response, i really hope that what is dead stays dead - that death has **impactful** consequences, and not just serves to advance the plot; it's a pretty poor storytelling device if used just to make another character rush into things without consideration.
---
I personally hope Aurene stays dead, and we actually face the end of days. As with the last dragon cycle: the dragons awoke, consumed magic, the older races fought them but didn't achieve much, and once the dragons have been satiated and the magic was gone, they went to sleep. We managed to kill some of them this time, and we were this great hero of the current dragon cycle, but in the end - the dragons win, Tyria is forever changed, and the dragons go to sleep again.
---
Enter Guild Wars 3.
---
Theoretically, the real version of Dessa's laboratory should exist somewhere in the Mists, but there is a possibility that it was either destroyed or swallowed by the Mists.
---
If you build your house in Tyria, then you can expect a certain level of permanence. Unless a dragon sits on it, that house will stand until the bricks and mortar fall apart.
---
But there's no such guarantee in the Mists. When your computer encounters something unexpected, sometimes it can enter and get stuck a programming loop, or it can just crash outright. Perhaps that's what happened to Dessa and her lab.
---
However, I don't think we've ever found real people in the Mists aside from our player characters. It might be possible, but to date, it's unprecedented.
---
RIP me, my axe is soulbound to my Warrior so I can't switch it to my Necro .\_.

The Pale Tree is NOT a dragon. She's implied to be one of the blighting trees without her master's influence. The champion of a dragon does not mean it is itself a dragon, it's just a being with a significant investiture of the dragons power with some level of autonomy. For instance, the three Mordrem commanders are champions. 
---
Aurene is very specifically a dragon, biologically and metaphysically.

Sure I will add you!
---
ah didnt see that one, will delete my post, cheers
---
T4 Fractals gets you 10-25g per day and only takes 30-50 minutes depending on your group. 
---
In fact, the wording of these new policies mostly contains variations of "does not provide the user with an unfair advantage over other players" (direct quote from the macro policy linked above) so *technically* something that merely lets you *break even* with the average player might be entirely legal. Try contacting support about that, I have never seen any official statements regarding the use of genuine disability aids. 
---
Failing that, if it truly is a concern you should be playing differently/less. Just moving around requires holding down turn/camera buttons *all the time* even with autorun. Mobs take at least one keypress each, more realistically 3-5 for normal trash and many more for veterans or higher. Regular nodes are far more common and each rich node is only 3 key presses without macros. Kill one less trashmob per rich vein and you break even. Or if your condition only affects one hand get a mouse with a lot of side buttons and add a keybind for "F" interaction to whichever one is easiest to press. Even on a regular mouse you can bind it to "middle mouse button" (mousewheel press down).
---
Granted ArenaNet generally is pro-inclusion so even if they ever do ban you (which is unlikely to begin with unless you do nothing *but* farming rich nodes) they will probably show leniency once you explain your disability.

---
While there's some issues in this benchmark, I would like to see more discussion on this subject overall. Optimization of high-boon duration builds isn't trivial due to the lack of crit once you push to high boon durations, especially if you also want pack runes which many pugs do. 
---
On top of that you get huge differences in performance based assumptions making it harder to evaluate builds. Slow uptime is required for danger time, as well as a tighter rotation due to losing improved alac. How worthwhile is the tradeoff in realistic scenarios? Even if danger time is worthwhile - how bad is the DPS loss when slow uptime is bad? 
---
Currently the optimized chrono builds are already running quite a lot of assassins to boost critrate. The more you spec into diviner, the more crit becomes an issue... But i've not really seen benchmarks to gauge howmuch of an issue it really is. 
---
Especially ingame I notice a lot of players gearing towards (nearly) full diviner, but I've seen very few chronos do relevant dps still. 
---
And how big is the DPS loss of pushing boon duration higher? I assume 40% boon duration from diviners will have quite respectable DPS still. Howmuch do you lose pushing that up to 60 or 80%? 
---
Does you rotation become easier or more difficult by going into danger time with more boon duration? Sure - your boons last longer but you also apply them less frequently (which makes applying boons to then prolong them especially for bosses with mechanics / movement even more difficult). 
---
Personally i'd be interested in "chrono benchmarks" for things like 40% / 60% / 80% / 100% boon duration. While these are obviously irrelevant for speedrunners I think they're fairly relevant for (most) pugs. Also interested to see if optimal runes / sigils / traits / ... swap for high boon duration builds (e.g. swap of force towards accuracy just because the critrate is /that/ shit).
---
It is probably less about the trees but more about the jump to the section with the block. Due to how the engine works with kinetic energy to a certain extend, walking down a slope and jumping from it results in a shorter jump distance than jumping from a horizontally level surface. The last small rock pillar has these slopes to all sides and that makes the jump timing reeeeally tight - too early and you'll fall short, too late and you'll be too low - so tight in fact that dodgejumping is the far more reliable way to get across.
---
The only way to alleviate this is to start walking along the ledge, then turn 90° and jump at the same time. Or you walk along the corner of two adjascent slopes, which is a slightly less steep slope and thus results in longer jumps.
---
W2Z2 has a second jump of this kind, the one from the flower pillar shortly before the hill with the ton of bouncing rocks. That one is also incredibly difficult to time unless dodgejumping.
---
&gt; So what happens if that /lord/ is defended by a group of players? 
---
You either wait until they leave, you make sure they leave (by providing some incentive to defend something else instead), or if you are strong enough, you concentrate on killing the players first and prevent new players to join on the lord.

You can also learn to control your movement, like roller beetle racers do when doing a big turn. Slippery slope bomb carring in underground facility is not that bad if you know when to walk in which direction so you do not hit the wall and lose acceleration.
---
Oh no, I actually think they did a lot, but they probably think there's nothing exciting to share in back-end development.

You've convinced me to make a female norn for my main story character. 
---
People on this sub have a really bad habit of not reading the OP.
---
You only need a lot of boon duration when playing Duel Illusion (and then 80-100% is recommended I'd say).
---
When in raids while playing Inspiration you can go low-ish even if 50% is a safe mark.
---
Then depending on who you play with you may want to get some extra boon duration for safety in case people miss you some of your wells or ToT.
---
Yeah but one Druid can do all of that so typically in experienced groups the second healer is a scourge/herald/tempest. In speed run groups there’s only one Druid and no off healer

I wouldn't hang my hopes on something they said they'd deliver by a certain time, tbh.

I'm all for getting another episode in LS4! I just don't want to get my hopes up as we don't have any really reliable information to build expectations on either way.

You could do gathering stuff. Or Trade Post content, though that's indirect group content. Could also farm certain mobs for certain drops with high magic find. What those mobs and drops are, I don't know, but have heard people farming them for profit.
---
&gt; You either wait until they leave, you make sure they leave (by providing some incentive to defend something else instead), or if you are strong enough, you concentrate on killing the players first and prevent new players to join on the lord. 
---
Exactly. This is why "buffing" lords and making them more "interactive" removes interaction between your group and the enemy group. 
---
How is it an improvement to WvW to further increase the waiting time in between the (already short and increasingly more rare) fights between groups? 
---
In reality, increasing the amount of mechanics on lords or buffing defense means "even" fights are more and more rare. Objectives do not promote or create these anymore because most objectives, especially once upgraded, are very overpowered. That's fine for home keeps and garries which should be very defender-favored, but not for central objectives which should promote interaction such as SM. 
---
As you admit - even groups or even somewhat even groups don't go to the lord. They stall. Wait. Do something else. Avoid the engage and further weaken the enemy group. You say kill the players first - but there's no reason for them to walk out and get killed. One side avoids the fight because if they force it (go out of lords / safe zone) they lose. The other side does the exact same because they know if they go on lord early, they lose. 
---
These added mechanics dont' promote proactive plays or player interaction. They promote stalemates as long as groups are evenly matched... Which truthfully is just boring. You only go to lord once you're strong enough to power through. 
---
And without enemies, unless they make lords literally dhuum it will /never/ be challenging or make things more interesting. 
---
WvWers want to fight eachother - not look at eachother until one side gets bored, logs off while the other side demands more interesting PvE mechanics for their karma train. But that's exactly what lord mechanics and overpowered defensive measures do.

Heartbreak isn't always romantic. It's entirely possible he could feel a sense of heartbreak with Rox leaving.
---
I'd love a scene of him and the Commander just sitting, staring at the view, where out of the silence he says "... I miss her" and we get to have a heart to heart moment with him.

Rytlock speaks a few times before the big fight, during the original charging the crystals mission and right as you prep for the final battle. He references his past battle and "being here before" on at least 2 occasions.
---
&gt; it is ok if not everything is achievable.
---
The problem is that it’s not “this will take you a long time to get” it’s “this is only possible to get if you have all the AP from S1 and early festivals, back when they handed it out more freely”. There’s a gap between people who played back then and those who didn’t that will never close if Anet keeps being so stingy with new AP.

200% yes. I was super happy when they almost connected in ??? In that one fight with the asura gates.

Braham is easily my favorite after taimi solely for his happy go lucky bro attitude he has when not angsty. I mean E-P-I-D-E-M-I-C Ka-Braham had me in stitches

I loved the angsty Braham arc because I was genuinely annoyed at him, which made the moment at ??? So much better. That moment of mutual forgiveness would've had no weight without the angsty Braham arc and that's really developed the relationship with us and him quite a bit.
---
Using the festive tonic is way far cheaper ;) But very, very, veryyyy long to achiev.  
---
I just feel like in original Guild Wars right now. "click-click. click-click. click-click. ... ... click-click -\_\_\_-"  
---
Ah, this. The deeper yoy get in and the more skills/builds you unlock (especially on things like engi and elementalist) the more complex skill managment gets
---
I am quite sure they didn't establish it for just one episode. It will be relevant again. 
---
Why should this gab be closed, it is ok if not everything is achievable.
---
Oh no no im not saying angsty braham is bad, it was extrmely important to his character growth and felt natural with his mothers death and how the world and the commander went about things.
---
Just i love me my bro norn

Seasonal stuff like gifts for Wintersday can be very profitable. Other than that your thief can solo dungeons. It may not necessarily be quicker than a five man run, but it's definitely challenging. Someone even managed to solo a raid boss, but that can take hours.
---
Here's an extreme example: Solo VG
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8n799l/bats\_solo\_vale\_guardian\_4h27m/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8n799l/bats_solo_vale_guardian_4h27m/)
---
So, unless doing it with pugs takes even longer, solo raiding isn't the most profitable.
---
I know what you meant, don't worry :D 
---
Although I do feel like the majority of the community might not like angsty Braham purely because of his sooty attitude and they don't realise the wider implications
---
But yeah I love his bro attitude right now as well
---
I had this on one any of my 4 accounts too, it's never consistent or just the 4th. What works for me is I close the game client. Open it back up and it will give a new error, this time saying wrong password. I put in the password (correctly, again) and it lets me in.
---
Taking control away from the player in anyway is a terrible idea. Difficultly should come from the fractal bosses/content itself not a randomly rolled instab. It is flat out fun and unenjoyable and should be removed.
---
How can I use different login servers?  
---
i would want it to deal with grief and us trying to get her back but in the end the game just says no, but there's still hope (which would be the set up for season 5)
---
Final Fantasy 14 did exactly that. Ended the world, big cut scene, everyone loses. Square Enix then massively updated the game and relaunched it.
---
Only if you have some specific mastery and heart of thorns.
---
I was playing with a friend that had an Festive Aurene mini.
---
Awkward...
---
You know, it actually looks a lot more natural than the weird waddle they do when walking now.
---
I know that there are certainly some gender issues, especially in this industry (speaking as a woman who has worked in the industry) - and that the thing she claimed happen actually *does* happen to people..  but it seems like she's so defensive that she's no longer able to discern legitimate issues from normal interactions. I didn't think the guy was talking down to her or undermining her professional opinion by any means - it seemed like he was just interested in the conversation and wanted to participate. Which is what happens on Twitter (seriously, LOL). She certainly lacks the patience to understand or at least try with people who may or may not intend whatever offense she's reading into things. 
---
It's not very rational or sensible to discuss elements of game design (incl. narrative) in a public forum, then freak out when someone has the audacity to want to engage in the discussion. Of course a post is going to get public comment and feedback on Twitter of all places, and with a post history like hers she has to know she's courting the very type of engagement she complains about. I'm guessing she's reached the mindset of just assuming everyone is attempting to discredit/attack her, as opposed to actually reading the situation or giving the benefit of the doubt, because it's "easier" or less time/energy consuming to just be an asshole to people. Which is unfortunate.

you might be asking if you should purchase the game and remove f2p limitations, in which case - if you did not like the game so far, there is little chance you will like it at all, and not spending the money on things you don't like is preferable 
---
Nah, we going further north to Kralks resting place in the Charr homelands. Anet made map changes up there when they were making changes to create Istan and co.
---
it wasn't my best performance but there was something happened in guild and i just wanted to blow off some steam. so when i saw that lfg pugging and nobody joining, here i came.  
---
they indicated "comfortable with slippery slope" which i've never seen before. lol. but shhh they don't know that.   
---
died at least 4 times just trying to get the first mistlock. so i stopped trying, think they'd kick me. lol. but it's a lot of fun! i still feel the sliding effect from that 100CM with the rest of t4s later. i think Anet did a fantastic job on these new instabilities! especially SA and slippery slope. 
---
we call SA - bumping cars and slippery slope - tony hawk's pro skater
---
In fairness, they are extremely weak characters, just say they retired and are living happily ever after. I'm more than happy with Sayida and her crew and now Zafirah too. Braham and Rox have both been developed in the living world episodes, I'm really not holding my breath for any more Marj and Kass. They can go the way of Zojja and Eir.
---
Before you didn't need to complete the achievements if you weren't a big fan of open world you could get the skin by completing the PvP/wvw reward track
---
Aren't you using launchbuddy to multi-box? Because launch buddy has the option afaik. http://i.imgur.com/7eI1ee8.png
---
No it’s more about getting a boost I heard people say the early games boring and that’s the same reason I quit 
---
A dragon and her fashionable lesbian plant mom 
---
Yes, but the combination of named and "string" threw me off. At that point I felt the urge to end every statement with a ';'.
---
Well I'd generally like to see more crafting stations in the world. 
---
It's a big deal for charr to change their warband.
---
Nope. I use the mac clients to login mostly. I can run the old 32-bit and the 64-bit at once without any additional programs. It's slow, but for multibox purposes like farming home instance it works. Otherwise I just log into them individually.
---
A level 80 adjusted to the area, who may very well have "level 80 gear" that is not that good can die pretty much everywhere if not careful enough.
---
Being level 80 helps, but the adjustment makes sure you still have to look at your screen at least every minute or so
---
unlike gw1, here all the loot is individual which means soloing stuff isn't as profitable
---
you can however solo and sell dungeons but the market for that kinda died out(people still buy arah though sometimes)..also selling cm fractals but those might prove tricky to solo
---
so if you wanna turn a profit: daily crafts(some not all), gathering routes, map completion and selling the gift/legendary, TP flipping
---
Yeah, I'm not touching that with a ten foot pole. I'll buy my plate from the TP and use a tele to friend or mesmer portal from LFG daily for the next week or so.
---
&gt;they
---
*he
---
yea the 15k AP from dailies are a lot of work, but as you see they take up almost half of the max AP possible so far. so doing them everyday is definitely worth it.
---
It’s ok if things aren’t achievable because they’re really hard. “This isn’t achievable because you didn’t play in season one when we got 5x the AP we get now” just seems a little silly.
---
How does it work? 
---
Buy low, sell high
---
I first tried it on a Mirage but was having no luck whatsoever, either because axe clones or the condi ticks don't count for the kills. Then I swapped over to my necro. I would aggro some Does and allow them to whittle my health down before killing them one at a time.
---
I loved this scene, just played it yesterday and stopped there
---
This is anet design in a nutshell. Why do something that takes 6 hours of farming when you could do something that takes 20 minutes, 18 times, once per real world day?
---
She looks like frozen lettuce. Loved this scene though in all seriousness 
---
The voice is of unknown origin. Is it really dhuum?
---
And knowledge too? And Kralkatorrik absorbing that ting from Aurene, Making him a new Joko somehow? If a little dragon could do what Joko could, and chose not to, still a big one would need to eat the small one first, no? If that is how you transfer Joko's knowledge.
---
The dragon is semi-immortal, as there was nothing to kill it at the time, but fs that was his elaborate plan to destroy other dragons and god(s) - they would most likely find a way to resist.
---
alredy sent a report, might be intended as well.
---
no, he can teleport so there's nowhere to run to
---
Sometimes in gw1

&gt; sepulchre

No, I'm pretty sure that's just a small room or monument. I think they meant sepia. 
---
* New story. 
---
* Three-part meta event (north+south unlocks key to catacombs puzzle sequence with rewards - essential if you want diviner's gear, nice but not necessary otherwise). 
---
* Mastery points, achievements etc.
---
It does always drop, the tricky part is you have to be the one that does the killing blow to get it.
---
I would say the expansions and Living World content are all improvements on the core game. The development and design team have learnt and grown and refined things over the years. There's generally more variety and more experimentation, as well as an increase in production quality for much of the newer content.
---
Well, she loved Aurene, as my Female character, does it mean my character is a lesbian? Nope, love has many kinds. As I love my father, it doesn't mean  I am gay. 
---
Finally! That worked, awesome. Thanks :) Updating the post.
---
They are such weak characters that their names actually mean something to me, unless the Sayida and Zafirah you mentioned which I had to look up on the wiki :d
---
Current LS is just a mess. It's funny for what **we** are doing, but other than Taimi the support cast is just utterly forgettable. And the stories written so that it doesn't matter either.
---
So you place orders to buy stuff and when someone uses the sell instant option, you place that item in the tp and wait for someone to use the buy instant option? 
---
Probably, his magic is inside her now for all we know.
---
Personally, I really enjoy the shake-up of slippery slope. I had a lot of fun with it today.
---
I did that yesterday for first time i found 3 chests but did not get anything. I guildie of mine also told me i would get 3 but unless i did something very wrong it did not happen. But i retry today and see if it works. Thanks for the answer though :)
---
Dayum that's true, it's not even Cherry Blossom Clothing. I'm not sure what it is now.
---
Thanks for your replies guys! I'll just buy extensions then, i don't mind about doing story for now
---
Even then, it makes sense within the context of his character - Braham tends to shy away from his problems.

Unexpectedly well-put together. Well done.

I think it's less the monetary cost and more the hangover from consuming 10k alcoholic beverages.

Yup. I know the dev's answer. For me this answer got more importance than a random witness. And i know that evrybody should be carefull with what is said here on reddit. "Everybody lie" \_ Dr Greg House ;p

That said, i can pay more attention myself than intended. As I said, it's really just my two cents. No offense. :)
---
I dont get the whining. Did it with 250kp rnd grp and we didnt have a single Problem. Actually it was quite fun tbh. 
---
Maybe, but the female asura voice didn't have that particularity, or I  didn't notice it at least.  I didn't play my asuras too often, though as I'm beyond horrible on Ele (my female asura) and Mesmer (my male asura).
---
Sounds like they should got gud 😎

What gameplay is locked behind grind in this episode? You dont NEED diviner gear anywhere. It makes some builds better yes but without they are also viable.

Did racing scarf changed material or something? It lost intensity of dyed colour by the tenfold.

I've recently replayed the whole story, missing season 1 for obvious reasons, and while Anet's storytelling has been all over the place in terms of quality, I really think that this past season of living world has been by far the strongest in terms of storytelling. It's understandable that you might have had to look up who Sayida and Zafirah were because Sayida was only introduced in episode 1 and Zafirah in episode 4, but I believe they have far more potential to have interesting stories. K&amp;M have been in the story for 4 seasons and 2 expansions (a few exceptions) and have really had nothing of note to offer. Marjory had that thing with her sister being killed which beyond the shock factor was so unintentionally hilarious due to GW2 ghost rendering that it lost all value. Kasmeer... hiccups I guess? and is wildly apologetic for everything?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but I would guess that you wouldn't have to look up who Zojja is or who Eir was but legacy value doesn't take away the fact that they were hugely uninteresting characters.
---
Swiggity swest
---
this one's the best
---
In pre HoT era, you would have seen some weird runs in arah's dungeon
---
Which achievement were you referring to? The enemies I killed for the below 10% achievement were branded enemies near Sayida’s heart quest (as it progresses the heart and lets me grab some Corsair supplies) 
---
As for the “kill 30 enemies” achievement, I honestly just got it while doing my daily hearts and the meta. Same with the other achievement.
---
I have heard that the achievements require you to last hit the enemies, but I was having no trouble at all using my Condition mirage to get the kills. Only issue I have is the lack of a progress tracking achievement that tells you how many more enemies you need to kill etc.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Solution is simple for now, Logout and login.
---
Same thing happened to me, there was always around 7-8 other players with me killing the Graveling, I must have killed it 20+ times and the next plate would not drop for me.  
---
I tried being the first to interact with the Sarcophogus, I tried not interacting with it, tried to tag/deal as much damage to the Graveling and not attack it at all, and I tried to be the first to attack it and the last, but with other players with me I can't be 100% I succeeded in doing any of that.  
---
The one thing I did notice though was that players that came in after us seemed to be getting the next plate and leaving. So I took the teleporter pad out of the room and back in and killed the Graveling again and the next plate dropped for me. Not sure if it was pure coincidence but worth trying if anyone else is experiencing this.
---
Assuming you have all the other requirements to craft a  gift of mastery, or a legendary, this would be my farm of choice. Lots of income.
---
Never gonna let you down!
---
you only get the light of deldrimor buff and scan skill for 30 minutes after you gave frodak your daily light of deldrimor plate, so you can only find these hidden chests in those 30 min. Once you know how to navigate each room and the upper/southern part of the catacombs, you can find the 6 chests in the 3 rooms you unlock yourself, the big hidden chest in the throne room and the 2 hidden chests in the southern part within 10 minutes and then you have 20 more minutes to find portals/teleports to the other 2 rooms you didnt gain access to.
---
But i am not sure, if you scan skill goes away, if you leave the map to join another shard via LFG.
---
Asura is both the singular and plural form. Asuras and Asurans are both no-nos.
---
You don’t need to use an axe to get the 10% achievement. 
---
I was wielding a Greatsword on my Reaper when I got the achievement
---
Shadows/Priory. EZ
---
Didn't he only manage due to several bugs/exploits?
---
She stopped being a detective long ago, though.
---
She kinda lost her her touch after S1 and went from leader type, to... I dunno how to describe it. She regressed for me.
---
If Spotter and all Spirits were *that* important, the meta compositions for raids wouldn't be one druid. 
---
As it stands, all spirits isn't that important. Sun Spirit is a tiny amount of DPS for power classes, Storm Spirit is often redundant given how many DPS classes put out decent amounts of vulnerability. Frost Spirit is again not that useful on bosses that favour condition damage, and Stone Spirit is sometimes just overkill on easier bosses like Samarog. As for Spotter, a few classes crit-cap without it, namely Dragonhunters, Holosmiths, and Deadeyes so you should pay attention to the DPS classes in your subgroup to see whether they benefit from spotter or not. 
---
I would even argue that a Healing Renegade brings much more value than a second Druid: they provide buffs a Druid can't, namely Assassin's Presence, Soulcleave's Summit, and higher healing. As far as I was aware it was even very much said on this subreddit that a Druid was actually among the worse choices for a second healer if you wanted one. Besides the obvious exceptions like Twin Largos. 
---
I confess that even if in reality it could totally do it, devs would never do it I have never seen in the history of GW2 a character like "Light Yagami" even if it would just be awesome. It would surprise me if such a complex character existed in a MMORPG  when most of the players see the story as a simple "little nice addition". :/
---
Caithe would probably know it, because of her connection, but she considers Aurene dead too.
---
So many posts on this sub saying exactly the same thing over and over, and I wonder why I'm clicking on them all.
---
that's the least like thing i've heard since the episode launched
---
Omg. I just realize what you say. Lmao. 
---
And yus butt cheeks and panties :"&gt; 
---
Look at skorvald cm. Do you think 3 reapers + warrior + chrono can phase it before the boss is not cced anymore? The damage between the classes is huge. I easily spike to 90k with my soulbeast on skorvald in the opener whereas reaper wont even pull 50k. Thats pretty ass in my eyes
---
No, god.
---
I hate Dark Souls for doing that.
---
i too have 1 main and 3 alts, i use launch buddy to launch the 3 alts at once and have no problems. are you using launch buddy? i was getting the same error on one of them, turns out i entered the details wrong on one of them. i deleted all 3 entries and remade them one by one carefully and it works fine.
---
I had this issue last night too.  I found if I was on a mount, the shaking immediately stopped, but it came back as soon as I dismounted, and continued to worsen.
---
Start playing à chat acteur indeed, left-click the daily chest and you're done.
---
Nowadays guilds play mesmer in GvG setup for Illusion of life and focus pull. Those, especially IoL is too impactful not to be used in 15s comp. the rest is just build around those... however you like.
---
I would absolutely love the guild halls!
---
It sounds like your ISP is screwing with you. Follow the instructions on [this page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments) and try the "-clientport 80" option. That eliminates a lot of the nonsense caused by your ISP.
---
I totally understand your first point about how DPS meters change the way you see things, I experience that myself. Just wanted to point out that arcDPS is actually very safe to use just so OP doesn't get scared away from it because of security concerns :)
---
In EU: yes
---
But from what I have heard NA is just a mindless blobfest 
---
I agree to an extent, but I'm willing to give Anet the benefit of the doubt because I've really enjoyed their recent content since HoT (Great maps, patchy story). Hopefully, the new characters get some love but it's early days.
---
To be fair, the persistence of crystals is no evidence per se. Risen and Mordrem didn't exactly revert to their original state upon turning into Unchained after their dragon masters' passing. Draconic corruption (whether the Elder Dragons' sinister, or Aurene's benevolent variant) persists after the dragon's death and apparently the physical manifestation of the energy can't be reversed in corrupted beings as far as we know. Thus Glint and Twitchy the Risen chicken remained in their corrupted form after their minds had been freed via the Forgotten purification ritual in Arah.
---
I'm surprised that none of these weapons have a sigil VS branded enemies or dragon minions in general.  Another missed opportunity.
---
From Tuesday's [release notes](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65145/game-update-notes-january-8-2019):
---
&gt; Fixed a lighting issue with the Racing Scarf shoulder armor.
---
Im not talking about other healers right now. Im purely talking about druid vs scourge because thats where it started. Mentioning meta builds is irrelevant here btw since you usually dont run 2 healers anyway. Im just talking about why people value druid over scourge
---
I like all your ideas ! I support them all. Some more than others which are very usefull and some of them (the estable for example) are just good cameo. But everything's still very good !  
---
Especially this :
---
&gt;5. Expand Special Forces Training Area  
---
a) Customize equipment  
---
b) Mechanics
---
Where do I sign for this ? How much is the portal scroll at gemstore ? XD I didn't know I needed this, but i need it !
---
Do you know what's the radius of the reveal of the light? Is it as tiny as the orb? Are the hidden chests always in the same spot? Do you have a map?
---
I'm thinking of doing a necromancer as well I don't think I'm fast enough with my moves you have to be elusive as a ranger lol (I use a controller) I do love the class but I don't think I know how to use it yet only been play 3 weeks 
---
Thief's pros and cons? I play both PVP and PVE and need a main that is meta in both
---
Struggle
---
Pretty sure they didn't know.
---
Didn't we already figure out that killing them is a Bad Thing(tm)? So what is the downside of an Elder Dragon immune to the one thing which could **utterly** unhinge the world?
---
He just has to consume enough magic and lower the overall level enough (read: GW2 servers eventually shut down) so he'll go back to sleep until a future time where the magic built up enough again (read: GW3 set years in the future).
---
There's plenty of guides on this sub or even youtube, just search for Istan farm.
---
the reason your raid build doesn't work in open world is because it's a highly specialized build that relies on team support to function (aka a druid to keep you alive and other support to boost your damage). in open world (while it is easier) requires you to be self-sufficient. 
---
i found that this is especially true for ele given how squishy he is.
---
if you really want a build metabattle has a few open world builds.
---
Wow! That's quality armor!
---
I would also like to see at least 1 episode that has no new map but instead additional things to do in the core maps (instanced) and more story. I think building a new map for every release consumes months of work that could also be put into story missions. And this is the reason why everything feels so rushed in every episode. They need to fit the story into 3 to 4 missions. Thats it.
---
In an ideal world, we would get the big episodes like now plus in between current event updates that already build upon the big story beats for the LW releases. This way we have time to address even smaller things while also having a sense of urgency to the big plot points in each episode. But this would mean, that the current events team also ups their game a bit. For example: A small story mission every 2 weeks between LW episodes. It doesn't need to be something big with gigantic boss fights or story revelations.
---
It wouldn't be so bad if we didn't already have to grind/regear about 6 times in the past year. 
---
Why believe there will be only 6? Season 2 had 8.
---
I already mentioned which arguments it disproves in my original response. The fact is, TacO is a 3rd party program that gives an advantage. It's also a fact that ArenaNet is currently okay with it. That doesn't mean it's a permanent stance, like how they changed their decision on marching a dodge jump. The discussion should be focused on how much of an advantage is allowed.
---
On that note, you decried a tool that marks the real mesmer as obviously not allowed. However, that still fits the criteria many people defend TacO with as obviously allowed: a visual overlay that doesn't play for you. It shows his example is relevant.
---

---
I often hear it can take 2+ weeks to get a respond, some are lucky having one after a few days.
---
&gt; The worst part is that this best-in-slot stat set (which is going to remain best-in-slot probably forever since it's pretty much perfectly optimized) is now permanently tied to Serpentine Jewel farm on this one episode 
---
I highly doubt that. They will add a recipe for the serpentine jewel and the raw serpentine ore probably in one of the coming episodes.
---
I hate that I can't tell if you're being serious or not
---
ngl fam this sounds fanfiction tier bad
---
I am not fond of how much less accessible LS4 stats like Harriers, Grievers or Diviners are to their LS3 equivalents like vipers.  It just seems like it sets a not so great precedent.  Logging in once over the course of a day and completing 2 short metas or buy-ordering the top/bottom plates isn't really a huge deal.  However, I do feel a little disconnected from the map as a means to an end... 
---
I think this sort of stat-design only really hurts average or casual players.  Long-term hardcore players can easily dip into currency stockpiles and get the new stats immediately whereas other players will be casually grinding for 1-2 weeks.  I generally don't think that it's a good idea for either trinkets (jewelry) or weapon recipes to be gated behind laurels -- completely out of left field, really. 
---
Sure, you don't need optimized stats.  However, for a lot of people optimization is satisfying and fun.  Telling average/casual players that they have to choose between either stat-swapping weapons/armor or the new LS4 dragon's blood and heroic set just feels like a bit of a low blow to me since you've never had to do so before in the past. 
---
&gt; left-click the daily chest
---
you can save this part for later.
---
Hah, I thought the same when my human female said "our children." I wonder what Sylvari characters say. 
---
Sounds pretty much like the weird Anet logic, so i think your thought about it might be possible.
---
I play chrono. I have given up and started gearing up guardian and revenant. 
---
have you seen the (comlaints from) raid armor? good luck with some single item which even less people will have in the next coming years.
---
The only thing that is not fine is that the graveling in the purple room does not always give you the plate. You have to kill him alone to get the next plate. Hoping you are alone in an open world area is clearly a bug and will be fixed soon I'm guessing.
---
Well, at least some other people are disappointed too.  
---
I really really didn't like this episode, and since the only thing i ever liked about aurene was her cuteness, I'm quite happy for her to stay dead.  
---
I don't like that we failed and have no backup with no option for interaction by me. Everything felt on such crazy rails to me. The Missions were again unfailable, the glints-lair one even more so, because you get resurrected right on the spot, instead of the usual 10s walk back.
---
In the end, I played quite horrifically bad, but still easily succeeded at reaching the failure.  
---
And that is supposed to be the season finale? About as bad an ending as Crimes of Grindelwald.
---
not sure what orb you are talking about but the it seems the light of deldrimor skill has a pretty big radius, maybe 2k or even 5k but i dont think it detects chests in other rooms. 
---
The spots of the chests also vary each day but since those rooms/areas are pretty linear, they arent really hard to find. Usually there is one at the start and one somewhere in the end.
---
Have a stun-break on your bar of via traits like Arcane Shield or Twist of Fate. 
---
Sickness must be purged if you play ff14!
---
I dont like timegated stuff in general, why does anet tell me how to play their game? If i wanna blow through everything in a 24h gaming session, then let me? Its my choice.
---
And no i dont complain afterwards that thers no content.
---
Try to tell that to the community... I almost never see firebrand/renegade/tempest played unless a friend of mine or I do it.
---
&gt;You don't need Diviner stats for your Chrono!
---
I don't need to play GW2 either, but I do so because it's fun and because I like to try out different builds and theorycraft and crunch numbers. When something like this is unnecessarily difficult to acquire, and out of line with similar mechanics in the game, it's frustrating. No one is arguing that we need Diviner gear. He'll, we don't need to play chrono. But we want it. So I guess your opinion  is technically valid? But you're kinda missing the point.
---
I mean, they HAD episodes without new maps, or several episodes in the same new map, and people complained about that (Dry Top / Silverwastes for example).
---
Good thing raiding is only a small part of the game that only a small part of the player base takes regular part in.
---
This shall be a mercy
---
the metas only have a low chance of dropping a jewel (and you only get to do one each every day).
---
The only guaranteed drop is from the Hidden Chest on the Throne Room, which awards 3 jewels. TO get there, you need the 2 plate halves form the metas ( or buy them from tp)
---
All i hope is a revisit to Eye of the North and and maybe start putting stuff in it again.
---
I guess im just unlucky as i opened all hidden chests, the daily chest and both metas every day and i still got only 11 for 3 days..
---
So what does and doesn't belong in dyejobs? Not impressed
---
How I play Ele in open world: relog to reaper. I played ele/tempest from launch to end of HoT. I unlocked reaper/scourge and never returned. Rip bag slots.
---
I don't see the point in struggling with 12k hp and playing piano when I can just play this juggernaut in full berserker who never dies. I could swap some berserker for valkyrie pieces to get even more hp.
---
What is a relatively short period of time? How fast are you switching?
---
Oh shit I am sorry to hear.
---
Can you tell us what the minimum was? Hope itll go better in February. 
---
There are different dialogues based on being commoner or Nobel, the order, race and class. You can check the wiki for the different ^^
---
Also, some events like in HoT, Sylvari can hear and understand the dragon Roar, other races just hear a loud roar.
---
There are a lot of such hidden things that you can only find out experiencing yourself ^^
---
Have fun ^^ 
---
Well, guilds just have to run 1 chrono i guess, but even that isn't all that required. Since you are only mesmer in comp, you will need veila nd illusion of life. Heal being well and elite being gwell.
---
Idk more than that tbh, i haven't played for more than 2 months now. 
---
But well, let's see. 
---
Interupts are not worth it, really, i've tested it out multiple times during different metas and it never works in a pressured scenario, which GvG should be. (you can see number of interupts in arcdps)
---
As for swaping traitlines, yeah, i would swap out chaos immedietly, it's just bad. Almost no GvG lasts long enough to use manipulation CD effectively, self boons on bountiful are just bad, since you will inevetably be running more revenants than before and they can cover with AOE boons. Middle trait.... well they suck.
---
Inspiration... Well, there has always been that 1 big reason why run inspiration and that's resportative illusions, that trait is one of most op traits there are on mesmer, if not THE best. But let's say you get enough cleanse from guards that you can change, but this one is more optional i guess.
---
Now what would we swap that for... Well, dueling would be my first guess, it has sword trait (since you are using double sword main) and 10+15% dmg modifier, on almost every relevant ?spike (slow traits are better imo, with dmg build on chrono 50base+30+20). 
---
As for domination and illusions idk, this is where i would probably prefer inspiration on really tough fights. But between the two, domination for me comes on top, with boonrip, dmg on vuln and dmg on shatters. 
---
Double dmg traitlines are quite hard to play tbh and shield IS REQUIRED. With my own agressive plays i make really good use of it's 5 too, but real thing is 4, with it's double block, soo good.
---
As for 3rd utility, probably blink, but depends on how agressive you are, also makes illusions rather consistent.
---
Ofc you can always play tankier.
---
Not just HoT, but also PoF. Auto looting is part of core Tyria mastery that unlocks of you buy either expansions. 
---
My warrior has very strong shoulders!
---
&gt; It may be because of the foefire, that made the ascalonien ghosts....diffetent.
---
It very much is. The Foefire was essentially a ritual or incantation performed (either inadvertently or otherwise) by King Adelbern during the Charr invasion of Ascalon. The soldiers that were still alive were essentially turned into spirits that are permanently stuck in that moment (hence why they see anyone not like them as an invader). It's also why the ghosts have permanence in the game world, as their residing in Tyria is due to a magical curse rather than just traveling from the Mists. 
---
That's also why the absence of Rytlock in the Mists was such a big deal. The whole reason of his owning Sohothin and attempted collection of Magdaer (alongside Eir) and the crown fragments was to help put an end to the ghost's assault permanently. The ritual he performed in Season 2 would have done so if it hadn't failed and led to him becoming a Revenant.
---
Yeah?
---
IF you had to regear 6 times in the past year, you'd be min-maxing raid / fractal builds. 
---
Half those regears were doable with just trinkets unless you wanted to fully min/max. If you fully min/max I assume you raid with an elitist static that has no issues clearing in under 3-4 hours. If you don't then honestly, 99% of pugs chronos I encounter don't do any damage. You can raid on full minstrel on chrono and nobody will bat an eye. 
---
Doing a full clear (W1-W6) gets me an entire, fresh ascended armor set every 3-4 weeks. This costs me 3-4 hours of time during that week. So if you're min maxing for raids because you do them frequently and with high requirements, you should be rolling in gear long before the next patch hits. 
---
If you're not rolling in gear before the next patch hits... why do you need fully min-maxed gear ?
---
Timegating is bad but celestial, nomad, sinister and several other stats have significantly worse timegate than diviner. 
---
While the game is not extremely optimized and using newer engines, it's not as bad as you make it sound...else I would not be able to hold a steady 50+ fps (usually hovering around 55-70 fps in the middle of the zone) in mistlock with models at low/medium (everything else capped and hook turned on) on a 1080ti and 8700k.
---
Check your firmware and drivers.
---
The stat combo isn't worth it, people are being fooled into it and wasting their gold. It isn't needed for t4 fractals or raids nor does anyone outside that content need it over the previously available items.
---
If you just have some desire to farm gear for a theoretical benefit, go for it. But if your someone stressing over a timegate for this gear, I don't know why when its not like its mandatory to complete any part of the game or even makes a noticeable difference compared to existing stat choices.
---
Tried googling if I can replace the parts but this is the best possible parts already. Saving up for a new laptop
---
Elementalist is super squishy in Berserker's gear. To get around this, I use the Fresh Air Tempest build with Scepter / Warhorn, but I sub out the Conjured Lightning hammer for Arcane shield and usually pop it when I initially aggro with overload air. You don't want to sub out Signet of Fire because it helps you generate crit for Fresh Air procs. I also run the passive trait that procs another arcane shield based on health percentage. With this build, you have to be pretty reactive in terms of switching attunements or you will eat dirt. Keep in mind, open world builds can be built off of meta raid builds, but consider that raid builds are made for content where you will have many other people supporting you and soaking damage for you. In a group PvE context, lightning hammer synergizes well with overload air and glyph of storms for heavy aoe damage, but in context of solo overworld PvE, lightning hammer is a liability since it removes direct access to your other weapon skills necessary for surviving. In circumstances where you'll be directly targeted 100% of the time, lightning hammer just doesn't make the cut.  
---
Here's a general rotation for a modified raid build you can find here:   
---
[http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vFAQJBLhFSxgmG2zAzGQHxSDgJEIDAfQ3Lbn9zWkFuCJSA-jpAXAAdZAY/BA](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vFAQJBLhFSxgmG2zAzGQHxSDgJEIDAfQ3Lbn9zWkFuCJSA-jpAXAAdZAY/BA)  
---
1. Start in Air, overload air on pull for stability and aoe. Use glyph here if there are a lot of mobs.
---
2. Pop arcane shield if under direct pressure before overload completes.
---
3. Orb, spam lightning strike and blind off cooldown.
---
4. Swap to fire, wildfire, dragon's tooth, phoenix, spread boons with warhorn 4.
---
5. Dodge while swapping into earth for the blast combo, pop reflect with warhorn 4.
---
6. If low on health, swap to water and pop skill 4, 5 while walking in the direction of the water orb, and skill 3 if necessary.
---
7. If not low on health or after step 6, swap back to air and repeat from step 1.
---
Also as a Herald if you’re channeling Glint, she says “everything has unfolded as a I knew it would” every now and then, even after the events of the latest chapter. She was dirty all along
---
&gt; laptop
---
That's the problem.
---
And now the final curtain! (71% health)
---
Gear stats should be something incredibly easy to get. I don't understand why everything that isn't the core stats have to have a bunch of other requirements 
---
Oh it's because they abandoned their easy to acquire gear philosophy when they brought in Ascended gear. 
---
&gt; I'd rather we just use Glint+Aurene's powers within the Mists to fight Kralk
---
I intended my use of "bring her back in some manner" to suggest she isn't totally out of the picture. Whether she Joko's herself back to life or manifests as an Ascended being in the Mists, *whatever actually happens,* her death isn't a total removal from the story.
---
You can always afford the closest waypoint!
---
NO REALLY? I thought WvWers just didn't deserve development because PvE is bigger anyways! 
---
I thought WvW wasn't profitable despite hundreds of people paying 500-1.8k gems every 2 months so they can't afford any devs!
---
Oh wait no, only PvErs buy things from the gemstore and fashion. Nobody from WvW ever would. Just walk through WvW and you'll notice everyone has the standard skins\*.  ^(\*requires enabling standard allied models and standard enemy models.) 
---
Whenever a zerg in WvW glides down, i swear there's no fancy gliders either. 
---
This seems like a bug that should get fixed pretty quickly. 
---
I'll buy it but only if it's a respawn point
---
Spoiler title, low effort post, late to the party...this post is bad on so many levels
---
To be honest, I think he's just preparing the next alliance update (the update is probably a few months out); alliances themselves I doubt will be released in 2019. 
---
I expect nothing and i'll still be dissapointed. 
---
ok
---
I saw someone post here that made it sound like the winner in "Odds and Ends" is not random.  I should have saved it, but they had a real good breakdown for which team would win based on the two contenders.
---
While Dulfy is faster, I appreciate that yours ends up more complete.  For example, Dulfy had a few that were skipped because they were bugged, and she doesn't often go back and update the page once they are fixed.
---
One party member of my static felt some dizziness. Possibly because of the constant accelerated and decelerated camera movement. It almost feels like head bobbing in Half Life 2.
---
What is gw2 gvg?
---
We've been Glint Roll'd !
---
I was looking for this comment.
---
If you really think the Corsair captain was a generic NPC, you've been ignoring half the story and dialogue and rushing through it. You're not forced to stop and look at NPCs as they talk anymore, so unless you actively look at people you won't see them.
---
If you'd never been forced to stop and listen to Marjory and kas's dialogue, or seen them in cutscenes, they'd be just as generic to you.
---
People are fine with grind. Silverwastes and Istan remain the most popular maps to this day. Heart of Thorns metas are completed daily.
---
The grind people hate is the time gated stuff.
---
I disagree with OP about Jahai Bluffs - that was a well designed map and achievement list and not that bad of a grind (it was mostly unique content each stage).
---
Time gated grinds like the current weapons or things like the Henge are really unpopular, but casual grinds (like Istan or Silverwastes) are endlessly popular.
---
ArenaNet really can win.
---
Low effort posts get only removed if they have the slightest negativity in them.
---
Talking from experience.
---
Other then that, the lowest of low effort is ok.
---
By any chance do you know of any NA guilds that GvG? Just curious.
---
Don't watch it.
---
Polymock*
---
If you look at the contenders it's possible to figure out who will win. There does seem to be a pattern along with certain contenders always losing. It's quite easy to pick 5 winners though. I'd go in to further detail with it but I'm not sure it really warrants it.
---
making some nice shoes out of her would be a win win. she has no pain, we have some nice new shoes.
---
People are definitely being ridiculously impatient about getting this stuff. OMG you didn't have it the first day after release!? what are you some kind of *peasant??* The time gating is pretty obnoxious for the PoI's, but still, it's really not that bad. It's only day 3 and people are losing their minds that they might have to play this content for a few more.
---
I'll concede the grind can get pretty boring, even Requiem armor required just doing the same shit over and over and over on multiple characters, for a good while. But when people come around talking about "replayability" and then get pissy when they have to repeat content to unlock stuff.. come on now. 
---
that trailer will take a while to come out and the trailers usually don't reveal much (just some setup for the episode)
---
Isn't it possible that both aurene and kralkatorrik will die. Aurene foresaw her own death no matter how the pact and the commander intervene. And kralkatorriks death was also foreseen in a similar way by him and glint.
---
I used to just pop the cooking fire of WoW and afk on a spot every now and then, I very much like the idea! Although Anet doesnt have a history of adding many "fun" toys like these often, maybe with the new novelty system they are building the infrastructure for it!
---
I didn’t have it quite as bad as this but I feel you. Since I was playing a sword/dagger ele I had the joy of using "Ride the Lightning" which lets you usually move forward beyond the speed cap. But on slippery slope you transform and continue moving at the same movement speed, if not slower. Movement related skills seem to be completely untested on slick surfaces.
---
Picking up my conjures also send me on a jolly adventure.
---
Good feedback? I smell a warning.
---
Turn model limit and quality to "Lowest", helps a lot in open world.
---
i doubt there are more then 3 pvp teams
---
thats what im saying. the episode is set up plenty good already. I really think it would be to the storys detriment to have a trailer at this point, similar to how infinity war part 2 can barely show anything in theirs because of how big a n ending part 1 was.
---
i honestly think its the opposite. the hardcore pvp crowd left the game long ago when anet didnt introduce anything. when they started to bring new modes, maps, automated tournaments it was already far too late
---
Skritt are dirty, and they often appear in poorly lit locations. So the white looks gray, and the red eyes look reddish brown.
---
Thank you!
---
Personally I play sword/dagger which gives high mobility while specd water/arcane, its got decent burst in fire/air and switching to water will give regen whenever you get low, it's the most fun I've had since switching to weaver, if you want details on the spec I'd have to wait till I'm home for the specifics 
---
Do both map metas to obtain the two halves of the Light of Deldrimor Plate. If you are a person with a real world schedule you can buy them (or the completed plate) from the TP for about 10g. You'll need one of these every day for each piece of Diviner's gear you want (more if you want the pretty new skins).
---
Go to the Hammer's Hoard, talk to the dwarf ghost and he'll give you a special treasure-scan skill in exchange for your plate. This skill only lasts for a certain amount of time.
---
Now complete the puzzle and scan at the end for a resplendent chest that contains 3 Exquisite Serpentite Jewels (this is the ONLY guaranteed way to obtain this account bound item, every other way is RNG). If you're a person with a real world schedule or a person who doesn't like doing a boring puzzle every day for two weeks to gear a character, you can use teleport to friends or friendly mesmers on LFG to get into the final room (but you still need the special skill from the Plate).
---
My prediction is that we might visit Cantha soon. Dredges are our friends now, and they are the key to Cantha since they have both areas linked by tunnels
---
What does buying raids mean? And how much is it usually per raid run? I heard it's not worth right?
---
Her death is not surprising honestly, we've been hinted at this since the last episode with the Dr, Strange's style visions of her being impaled in multiple cases, so it had to happen.
---
It's a bit farfetched but to me It wouldn't be surprising if the scenario takes a road implying a time travel or a parrallel universe (like Avengers) or something like that to prevent Aurene's death or even prevent Kralkatorrik to become as powerful as he is.
---
Right now there is nothing that we can do to stop him except if the other gods come back, or if one bigger powerful entity appears in the scenario.
---
I'm serious but if you find my arguments wrong, please express your opinion x)
---
Kasmeer &amp; Marjory mount pack confirmed!
---
This one stays blue.
---
There's a few PoIs still locked in HoT, tho. 
---
The Emperor protects
---
i meant more setup as in "why are we going to the new map?" and how are the characters at the start and that's usually all we get for the trailers.
---
i don't see what they usually do with their trailers that they would need to approach the next trailer with special care
---
/r/ofcoursethatsathing 
---
Well if we think this from a point of view of Aurene actually winning the fight and getting all that power and magic from Kralk, she would be storybreakingly OP ally to have. So I would say it fairly safe to say that she had to go no matter what. She didn't need to die, but disappear atleast. And what would be the best place to hide all that power than in her faar away from everyones reach.
---
Now keeping this in mind I think she did a bamboozle for us. She won the fight and became the most powerful dragon up to date, but when we were unconsious (wiki does say so aswell) she re-animated Kralks body with Zhaitan magic and made it to fly to a spot where Kralk woke up (the rumoured next map), then she planted the vision we saw of her dying to our minds with mordremoth magic and finally disappeared into the mists using Balthazar magic.
---
In next episode we track down Kralk to find a dead or sleeping dragon and have a "wait a minute" sensation, rush to where Aurenes body is supposed to be to find nothing - and roll credits.
---
Aurene is alive but we don't know where she is. We don't have an insanely OP ally. And we don't need to rely on resurrection or Deus ex machina gimmicks. 
---
I am running gw2 on a laptop and getting well over 80 frames in cities with g-sync at a 165hz on an external monitor. The laptop factor isn't the problem. The problem is that the laptop is not powerful enough. 
---
TBH I don't care if they return or not, they're the token lesbian characters, Faolain and Caithe weren't a walking cliché and Anet had the balls to make a tragic LBGT story with an evil character. Marjory and Kass are two curvaceous women with beautiful faces who happen to kiss each other, their relationship is so forced, plastic and artificial that we have to be CONSTANTLY REMINDED that they are in one!
---
In HoT I had no idea, they had to bring it up as forced dialogue during LS3, many times, and it's such an "in your face" thing because it usually comes as jokes.
---
In fact this episode keeps making reference to it as a joke with Taimi asking about it... Like "LOOK PEOPLE THEY'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP WE CAN MAKE FUNNY QUOTES ABOUT IT HAHAHAHAHA!"
---
The whole setting of that map is just an invite for an epic battle, raging from the South to the North and culminating at the Keep. There are even two bridges in between where we could have a '300' style fight.
---
Organizing Dredge support, getting the battlements ready, slowing the advancing enemy... Probably a massive forced retreat to the Keep in the face of an overwhelming enemy and then the final fight.
---
Gosh, now I am even more sad when next time I log in.
---
:(
---
Oh, no you don't! Back in chrono jail with you.
---
Yeah lets hope the same thing doesnt happen that happened to DS /s
---
I guess I'll say Springer, because there's no point to using it aside from "jump over this one wall and then swap back to an enjoyable mount"
---
in open world, there is almost no outside healing, you got to take care of yourself, so bring a full set of defensive utilities. e.g.
---
Healing: Glyph of Elemental Harmony since it has low recharge with large healing amount
---
Utilities: Arcane Shield (this is the best), Aftershock, Signet of Earth, Mist Form, etc
---
Elite: Glyph of Elementals. Earth is great for stuff like HPs. Air can cc and do some damage.
---
Buying raids mean you pay a group of skilled players to carry you through the encounter.
---
Raids are not that hard. If you are at all interested and have a bit of time, just learn to complete them yourself. There are great raid training Discords that will teach you everything you need to know.
---
Buying raids mesn that you pay a group of players to let you join the group to kill a boss, where you hit the boss for a bit to get killcredit and then die. The thing here is that they are able to low man kill it (8-9 players instead of 10), so they have 1-2 free spots which they can sell. Prices vary from boss to boss (and guilds have their own prices).
---
Normally you can see regular kills from 50-80 mystic coins, cms / extra hard bosses (dhuum, qadim) ca 120 mystic coins. That can vary thoufh.
---
In my opinion its only worth it if you want to either speed up the legy armour collections or if you are working on a title which your level of pugs or guild cant do, and you dont have the time to invest.
---
That could be it yeah.
---
But that creates a big problem. People don't play because ANet don't care about it anymore. Meanwhile ANet don't care about it because people don't play.
---
So how do we fix this?
---
Okay, will camp Observation Deck Waypoint!
---
I was waiting for an even to pop so I was just sitting there and I figured it would be cool if I was able to build a fire while I waited for the event. I am not a role player but I am somebody who will /sit when waiting around 
---
I really like the use of colour under the black lines. It makes it look like they're glowing!
---
Well done, that's awesome!
---
She stopped being a character after LS2. Now she's just a cardboard cut with a recorder to remind us she used to be a character.
---
But then you are back to the lowest settings. 
---
Well, they will be weaker with the lack of writing space they get these days. Kasmeer was just a tool to reflect the human deity crisis this expansion, for example. I personally love that they exist, maybe a bit selfishly, because they are an mmo pairing that actually works and we get so little relationships within relationships. 
---
I get that doesn't appeal to everybody, but I find it a shame they weren't brought along as characters (first), as a dynamic in the team particularly now that everybody else will fracture, and they could be leaned upon for stability, after the failure. Maybe it's a way back into writing for them.
---
It looks like how i run in my dreams. Like running under water!
---
Holy 67 gold minimum, alright thank you!
---
200? No. It would be 400 minimum. Probably 600
---
Can you simply craft an exotic inscription and then use the Mystic Forge to transmute and existing Ascended to a Diviner's Ascended to get the new skin?  
---
And if that's possible, does it also give the lesser (exotic) version?
---
If the early game is too boring to be worth pushing through, I dont see how being max level would magically make it more enjoyable. 
---
Gw2's levelling is one of the best in the genre, its fast, fun and rewarding with knowledge of the game and your class as well as a ton of mats for crafting/selling. 
---
The levelling is in my opinion a necessary experience. Gw2's combat isnt hard, but it isnt easy. You need to telegraph attacks, predict big hits to dodge them, calculate when to use your stunbreaks and condi-cleanse, etc Nd skipping the whole tutorial(levelling) will cripple you in the long term. 
---
Of course, if you wont play unless you boost, go ahead and try it, maybe for some reason it will give you a taste of the game you didnt have in the early levels and hook you, most likely it will just overwhelm you and you wont see any difference in the combat except a much higher difficulty in the level 80 maps. 
---
It was on sale! 
---
It would have been funnier if that last panel was the self-satisfied grin at the end of the /cheer emote.
---
Right now, its not a laptop. I have a potato computer
---
I mean, jackal and raptor pretty much fit the same role: go fast but not as fast as the beetle over unimpeded terrain. Everything else is specialized and doesn't really encroach on other mounts' territory.
---
Jackal is faster overall, and you can hold down the mount skill button for instant cast warps as soon as endurance regenerates.
---
Raptor is slower, but its "boosts" are faster and larger (but less frequent).
---
The trailer will include the line: "I don't know."
---
Step 1) aggro everything
---
Step 2) press lots of buttons
---
Step 3) downstate lava font
---
Step 4) ???
---
Step 5) profit
---
50 gold for the vision crystal as well as the other three components normally. Not 50 gold for an ascended weapon.
---
Dont worry about wasted xp, its not an issue, the mastery bars fill fast and missing out on a few k of xp is only god ng to cost you a few minutes. 
---
Or not. I forgot who Kasmeer and Marjory were after Dragon Bash (LS1E7) and rediscovered them in Nightmare Tower (LS1E13).
---
When you look at new laptop, make sure that you future proof yourself by investing 500 more than you are willing to spend. The wait to save up is worth it in the long haul. 
---
Sell the shitty phone, sell the shitty computer...make a new one (not buy...but make).

I want what you've been smoking :)
---
Honestly I think that's some great ideas.  A Branded Arachnia sounds immense and would be an awesome world boss.
---
One thing I wondered was, given it's the Mists, the Gods don't have the excuse that fighting an elder dragon would cause too much Collateral damage.  Maybe they could turn up?  Then again, maybe people have had enough of the Gods.  I just want to see a full on Pantheon vs Elder Dragon fight made real :)

jUsT RelOg reApER

Good idea, thank you!

There's quite some difference in presenting information, however context sensitive it is, and multiplying user inputs
---
Rendering sample: Supsample also helps a lot

The screenshot I took for this painting wasn’t ideal... I had to do some creative manipulating. There was a gpc on the screen with our characters I removed and I changed the background a bit. I tried to keep it bright but with the artistic flare that GW2 has (one of the reasons I love the game!) I used acrylics watered down to the point of watercolor for the effect. 
---
I took the picture with my phone of the screen so it wasn’t very good! That’s the great part of being an artist! 
---
You're trying to be sarcastic but the point you've raised solidifies my point. Dragon Stand metas have died off a lot. At their peak you'd have active DS maps in every single time slot. Now, they're much harder to fill and get done in certain time periods. If you're in peak EU or peak NA, good for you. If you're not, hope you have an active guild. Dragon Stand also reliably gives an amalgamated gemstone that can be sold even if the player has no use for it personally. Additionally, the number of harvestable pods in Dragon Stand was greatly increased from the initial launch value to ensure a reliable way for players to farm crystalline ore even if the map population dropped off and meta completion became inconsistent.
---
So thank you for raising a very good comparison between the similar problems that Dragon Stand used to have and the way that Anet addressed them.
---
You don't.
---
In all seriousness, I think the class still has a long way to go to be truly balanced, as playing him even in Open World is tricky because you die faster than most other classes, but at the same time you take longer to kill them because your single target damage sucks, your AOEs are quite good but the Open World builds are pretty much all the same and quite passive. Even being all aggro on enemies the damage you dish with full Zerk doesn't even comes close to the rapid burst a Holosmith or a Guardian can pull out with less cooldowns, more survivability, and more single target damage.
---
I'm not bashing on ele players, but many argue that he's good in open world and you can play whatever when I know PLENTY of players who moved on with another class after they made it to PoF (me included). Enemy AI in PoF maps isn't as braindead as before and they usualy move out of your static AoEs, and some even have time enough to CC and kill you from afar as you use Air Overcharge for example.
---
Bad groups think it's impossible to play with, good groups see it as a small nuisance or have fun with it.

**PvE -**
---
Pros:
---
\-Top tier power DPS for raids and fractals (right now anyways)
---
\-Enough build flexibility to adapt to pretty much every boss.
---
\-Has several viable builds across both elite specs: viable at both melee and ranged, easy and difficult rotations.
---
\-Strong on-demand CC without heavily disrupting your rotation (Except on Rifle deadeye)
---
\-Great open world/solo class.
---
Cons:
---
\-Despite having great CC and some nifty buffs from stealing, it's not a core support class.  It's vulnerable to falling out of the meta during balance patches.
---
\-Squishy
---
**PvP - (Pros and cons are build reliant, but in general...)**
---
Pros: 
---
\-Incredibly high mobility
---
\-Several viable builds
---
\-Great at taking unguarded points
---
\-Great ganker/forcing favorable fights
---
\-Lots of escape tools if you get in over your head
---
\-Squishy, so your mistakes can be punished hard
---
\-Not a teamfighter, favors small fights
---
\-Not great at holding points
---
I think you’ll make a great parent someday!
---
Literally unforgeable. 
---
I never said it was the game's fault???? Would try making a laptop instead for studying purposes, ty for advice. Would like to keep my phone thank you very much
---
I love my wings too!
---
Have you tried not being a cretin that makes so terrible fucking picture of his screen that we even see you in full shame in it?
---
Ty!
---
You are clearly mistaken.  It's actually the perfect gear for min/maxing chrono for Fractals, allows for a Power Support Renegade build and a Power Firebrand.
---
How much did it cost?
---
Rifle is way more fun than sword IMO. You run a bunch of kits like a mad bomber, and the rifle has some incredible CC options (and the leap is amazing for positioning)
---
Right, really sorry
---
Lololol 👍
---
I only need 1 more jewel to finish the sword. I was lucky I equipped it on a class that had conditions on sword (blindness &amp; 2 stacks of vulnerability meant I only needed 1/3rd the hits .
---
Your phrasing in your title (btw, that's not what a title is) comes off as a complaint against the game requiring high end PC.
---
I don't know what I was expecting but that really made me laugh. Thank you!
---
About 1k a few years back
---
Quick what's the opposite of "hotdog down a hallway"? 
---
&gt;I love gw2 and their take on skills and abilities and I felt that it was very refreshing to play a game with such refined mechanics. I however get so frustrated with the Auto Attack within the game I mean it's great that you have an Auto Attack feature and that makes the game very solid but the fact that the first skill in your skill bar is basically an Auto Attack frustrates me to no end.
---
You can switch the auto attack feature off or assign it to any other skill to auto cast. So there is nothing to be frustrated here. Great! Right?  
---
&gt;The reason is because when you turn it off you have to constantly press the first action slot and it just annoys me to no end.
---
The first action slot is a skill with 0 cooldown and usually with a chain feature, so 1st hit does something consecutive hit does something else and so on depending on the weapon and profession mix.   
---
And here I dont understand what you want...you don't like auto cast on skill 1 then you don't like to push it to use it...  
---
Btw, you can just hold the key down.  
---
U wish they did.. 
---
The machine or the display? 
---
Dragonsforge weapon skins that can only be crafted at the forge anyone??
---
You are completely right, any suggestions for rephrasing the question? 
---
yeah, why "reskin" a character [redo entirely her model tbh, she had a normal cultural so far, just an unavaiable face] for just 2 instances?
---
It's too bad, what she did. because it hurt a legitimate cause in the same way that the ladies who instigated the GamerGate reaction hurt their cause. A lot of American progressives are trying to achieve what other parts of the world already have achieved. but they're impatient, obnoxious and bullying, rather than open-minded, forward and patiently explaining. They have a lot of pseudo-theory going on that just doesn't fly with how northern Europe got where they are on Women's rights issues and LGBT issues. There's a lot of misleading, lying and verbal assault going on by clearly unstable people.
---
That's sort of the main problem for the modern American progressive movement. One they seem to have started to wrangle after the midterms: since Gamergate, the progressive "leaders" or the core people that people "looked up to" were just people who got there by being forceful, loud and not taking shit. But those traits aren't always indicative of a passionate fighter. Sometimes it indicates an angsty asshole or an opportunistic sociopath.
---
On the media and entertainment side, that's all the progressive movement has been, really. opportunists and manipulators. Most rational people are already progressive in almost every way these people claim we're not, but they really somehow want that cult-like obedience and people get suspicious as to just why. It' why people kept and keep groaning when NeoGAF and ResetEra gets brought forward as a journalist source. Because that forum is just such a cult.
---
Anyway 
---
TL;DR: What she did hurt her supposed cause, in that it hurt the people that unlike her, actually care about women and minorities place in society. But for her, it's just a cult. a purpose to wake up in the morning and a licence to abuse other people. She's in it for the appearance of power and influence, not to make progress. Much like Most other prominent Twitter feminists.
---
People have been labouring under some delusion that entertainment is where America will turn around systemic racism- but it's not. This blue wave is the first time i've heard people lay out and talk about progressive ideas without making it sound like a paranoid ramble full of holes or sound like manipulators trying to play an angle. 
---
**I hated every minute of GamerGate, because i got labeled a sexist and racist for liking games. I hate that EA have exploited progressives these past months to try to stay afloat. But i love me some blue wave. I love me some infrastructure, healthcare and education. because THAT'S what breeds tolerance!**
---
Really shouldn't play Chaos anymore - there's no benefit aside from a bit of protection and boon duration.  The nerf to Bountiful Disillusionment really killed the trait line.
---
Now, you take Insp + any of Dueling/Domi/Illu, which each have their own upsides. Dueling/Illu is also still great in 5-man content if you don't need aegis share.
---
So giant obvious PvP markers using every bit of information still available despite an enemy being stealthed would be okay? Things like giant growing circles for how far they could have moved, flashing warnings for incoming projectiles, explicit display of every skill that hits you if it appears in the combat log?
---
What about PvE oversights where they *tried* to hide something but it still renders shadows or a pre-placed marker clips through obstructions? Squad markers on the Eyes in W5 seem reasonable enough but I doubt they anticipated the use of AoE circles in JP darkrooms or calling target on Aurene while playing hide&amp;seek.
---
Light is a cool character but he's not very complex. He's a God complex character, plain and simple. If anything, L is more complex.
---
Not really. Op states he has a potato and that his potato cannot live up to his gw2 expectations. Not sure how "anet bad" came out of that
---
Also - you still get only 2 completed Gifts of Exploration for full map-comp. As it was before. (ok actual after rework its 2,5 GoE for full map-comp)
---
Its just seperated to per-Region reward instead to get enough for 2 legys after 5-Regions.
---
Well rQm gvged a lot, they transferred to EU for GvGs, but they disbanded. 
---
There is a NA WvW discord and im occasionally reading about GvGs but not often. Find out yourself, here is the link:
---
https://discord.gg/kpbZvHb
---
casually clicked it at work, NOPE.
---
i find slippery slope fun as fuck and i don't get the whining. pressing WSAD more carefully so hard?
---
Then you should never use a video guide as it's essentially the same thing. 
---
Very much on board with how stupid this is.
---
I do understand them saying "we want ppl to get serpentine jewels for the new dragonsblood weapons", but, putting them in the divinier insignia/inscription part of the recipe was very much the wrong choice.
---
I wanted to reroll an armorset and when i looked at the recipe and, honestly, i already quit when seeing the map materials. I didnt know what those jewels were until i crafted the Dragonsblood scepter and, knowing it now, whoever thought it would be a good idea to timegate these things like this should seriously reconsider how they value the players time.
---
If they moved the jewels from the insignia/inscription to the dragonsblood weapons (instead of the "more currency here" part) and then left if be, it probably would have been fine.
---
No.  You'll get the antique skin with Diviner's stats that way.
---
Oh, that question was asked to Zosin
---
eksdeeee
---
And i can only agree with you. I only used the "dps meter" and i never had any problem. The only thing i've through is "the-update-thing" when a big update for the game is available you usually need to disable and download the newest arcDPS. Not that big a deal.
---
I'll edit my first post. I don't want to scary anybody. 
---
So TLDR gw2 needs more wow-esque toys.
---
Cus what we got are fun as hell
---
I haven't had the chance to play it yet so without any spoilers, does it seem like the latest LS episode was the season finale?
---
&gt; You don't need diviner stats for your chrono!
---
but what if i want it tho
---
the gear situation in this game is ridiculous, most attempts at trying new builds are killed by "yea im motivated lets try a new build.. oh but id have to do random shit for a week to get it.. oh but id also have to find 2 other players whod want to do random shit for a week to adjust their builds to mine.. oh it turned out bad lemme just throw away all this expensive junk i just dumped a week into.. oh i guess ill just fucking stick with what ive got"
---
it may be good for player retention or whatever but its killing buildwars more than any op chrono build ever could
---
I think they mean Rox joining Olmakhan, so she wont be as close with the group coming forward.
---
Machine.
---
As said : \*Kralk to Aurene\* "Truth is, the game was rigged from the start"  
---
But nonetheless, pretty interessting thought you had there, i liked the read
---
So at what point do you think conspiracy theories actually write the story of this game, because anet has no idea wtf they are doing?
---
I went back and sat through it all (takes about an hour for it all to play out) not sure how exactly it's timed though. These *should* be in order, at least they were when I uploaded them.
---
[Spoiler Warning - just in case!](https://imgur.com/a/zuUTecK)
---
Every ds meta ive done was full? I dont know what youre talking about. Even at 2 o clock or smt
---
No - it's been confirmed there is one more episode in S4.
---
just do T4 fractals, minimum of 10 gold a day ez  
---
you need a full ascended gear and 150 agony res tho
---
We don't know if any of the other Elder Dragon's couldn't see the future; it should be noted that the Pale Tree, the creation of Mordremoth, could see the future via the Dream:
---
**Avatar of the Tree:** To know the future, even a mere possibility, can be a great burden. I am sorry, brave heroes, that you must walk this path.

---
So? That is normal.
---
Only if the magic was distributed randomly.  Killing them without Aurene there to absorb the magic means that it just powers up the other remaining, and unbalances their elemental forces even more.  Aurene was supposed to eat the magic for us and just keep it or something.
---
Rip what time was that?
---
You can easily ignore season 2. Gameplay wise it's rather dated, and storywise - just read up on it if you're interested in the story.
---
Better get s3/s4.
---
as a necro main i will tell you this:  
---
pve:
---
i have done every boss in raid wings 1-5 with my necro (condi scourge) , and never been told that it's bad or unwanted, you can even play as a healer scourge which seems to get more popular everyday.  
---
it has some decent dps, not the best but its not bad either, with a very easy "rotation"(you actually don't have one, you just spam skills of cd) you can provide some cc and could get more with your elite minion.and can even give your subgroup barrier.
---
not to mention the greatest skill in the game for clearing mobs: EPIDEMIC.
---
pvp:
---
necro is one of the strongest classes, both scourge and reaper.
---
sadly i can't help you about its state in wvw bc i don't play that game mode.
---
I just hit 10k last year with about a 1000 hours logged and I was very proud of myself. If I even make it to 20k someday I will be amazed.
---
Valid point! I should've put an /s there first of all, but I meant kralk's brand attack has a big tell meaning you can see it coming so just hold up the mirror then
---
You dont want a LIVING WORLD trailer to have LIVING WORLD information can you see the silliness in that.
---
Ah yeah I totally get what you are looking for :) I am one of those "comfy" and "candles" people too. But apparently I wouldnt know of such a bonfire. Havent seen one. :(
---
Koll those Asuran rats, kill them all!
---
I provided them with previous order numbers, the associated email address and the old SMS auth number. Think that'll be enough to get the SMS authentication removed? 
---
Totally agree with you on that
---
NOOICE 
---
I may be wrong, but I think it's the NPC that starts one of the delivery adventures in the south..west of the map? 
---
This IS Sparta. 
---
I was thinking more about Rox just having decided that she's gonna go live with the Olmakhan.
---
The imminent separation drama has been coming for a while now, and I think it's okay. Messing it with a weird interspecies/same sex triangle drama with a non-character would come off as a really weird twist that I think feels more like a beginning of a character arc for Braham than an ending to a (mode of) relationship. Maybe if it's revealed in an epilogue that Rox went to live with Bottica, it might work, but if they screw it up with "Hey, Braham, sorry, but I'm moving in with Bottica now!" it feels like a beginning of some shitty teen comedy.
---
[*Braham Doesn't Know*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgi0o-klEw)
---
Actually... that's kinda funny. Now I want to see it happen.
---
Oceanic. About 9 or 10PM for GMT+10? This was during the period when the Istan meta farm was in its peak, so I don't doubt that was part of the issue. The player population is probably more spread out at the moment so it's likely more viable than it was back then, but even now getting a successful DS map off-peak can be a bit touch and go.
---
I wish I still felt this way. I've almost completely 
---
 fallen out of love with gw2.  Played since head start and I come back once a week because of the time I invested getting legendaries and saving for infusions. 
---
'Foolish creature! I am a Force of Nature made manifest! What are you?'
---
"Still standing, bitch!"
---
Diviner gear is probably more important for Rev/FB which is why I imagine people would want it.
---
Then lower the settings more.
---
Yea, because 70% of the story of Gw2 our character is wirtten like a mary sue, that gets everything and can do everything after at least two tries. 
---
What makes him appear relativly OP, only in PoF they started to make the commander to something significant, like that one time with balthi, but that doenst even really count, because all it did was ... nothing, we just stood up some time later and killed Balthi. The only thing that part of the plot was devalue the concept of death in gw2, thats why so many people "hope" Aurene just pops backs in during the next two episodes. 
---
The last fight, is the first fight, we actually got f'd up. This was the first time, taimi, aurene, or some of the others didnt came up with a magnificent plan to instantly rescue the after gathering some information and the first time, that we saw how strong the elder dragons should have been all the time. 
---
Was this last night in Gendarran Fields? I remember someone commenting at the end it was just for the tree it was on top of XD
---
&gt; Missing the point entirely.
---
Why the fuck do you think I asked all those questions in my wall of text? Because you didn't explain your point and I admitted to not knowing what the fuck you're talking about!
---
My personal theory is that Caithe will sacrifice herself to resurrect Aurene
---
Chances are Glint planned this she is prophetic dragon. Yes she is the scion of Kralky but she fought him if she was working with him she would have let Destinys Edge face the dragon on their own. 
---
but why? You can right click and ''open all''
---
Order of whispers also has cool full concealment hood and mask(although i think on female characters its only hood but no mask), which was main reason why i chose order
---
I just player 2.5... ul’dah must be purged!
---
Well not just us sure Braham shielded us but Caithe and Braham to a shot from Kralky too.
---
If I remember correctly in gw2 fps drops are in highly populated areas only. That said comparison with bf5 makes no sense (when lot of people are in your fov bf5 reacts badly as well). Try limit max models in gw2 keeping rest maxed out
---
that number includes you, and "friends" is flexible :P you can always grab some bored randos from LA
---
I'll take 12.
---
Removed: Please keep bug discussion contained to the [Bug Thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/adx8ul/patch_bug_thread_8_january_2019/).
---
Yeah like I said ;p
---
&gt; That_shaman also founds out there were 7 slots in the Living Story portal book, 5 being used so far by episodes and a sixth one for the Sun's Refuge, leaving one slot left for a potential episode 6.
---
Nobody claimed that it cannot be finished anymore. It is poorly implemented and is a nuisance instead of a well thought increase in difficulty as well as a decent synergy with existing mechanics of fractals. 
---
This guy/gal mounts! Completely agree with everything you said.
---
I mean look at dictators like Kim Jong Un he knows if he opens up North Korea he is done for so he does eveything he can to prevent being removed from power. Its human nature if you feel or know there is a threat to you then you try and prevent it this doesn't mean human beings can see the future. Thats what I see here. Kralkatorrik and the other dragons know that when they woke up the races would try and fight them they learned this when they woke up the last time so they probably knew that the races would try to fight them. Kralkatorrik wants to eat magic he wants to live. It fear vs flight. He is scared and will continue to fight. 
---
Plot armor.
---
EU I guess?
---
Because I definitely went almost a year on NA not being able to find a single clear of Dragons Stand.
---
Wait wait wait, you could use the tonics??? Oh my goodness I wasted so much money...
---
Likely so. And I feel that in the time remaining that Taimi has left, her desperation will lead to the discovery of some way to accomplish just that so she die having done something she felt was important to everyone, seeing as she feels useless a lot of times.
---
Well, Jessica Price said on [twitter](http://archive.fo/8KJ1N) that this was the last episode that she worked on. Added in the discussion that they worked on this episode long before infinity wars.
---
And I was like, what would that matter, kralkatorik just left, he didn't kill half of....oh. People predict that what Dr Strange saw in the future was that half the people HAD to die, so probably in guild wars 2, glint predicted aurene HAD to die, so we can win. My guess is that she will come back in the next episode. And we will kill kralk.
---
Which is a shame, I really wanted to see the conundrum between avenging aurene and having to deal with a supercharged jormag, primordius and bubbles or letting kralk live.
---
One additional safeguard would be to try and make the macro slightly inefficient, ideally with minor randomness on top of that. Say it takes 3s to strike the node with your gathering tool, so set your macro to 3.5s delay or 3.3-3.7s or something like that.
---
I don't think we ever got answers on "auto rotation macros" where you spam one button to satisfy the "one button per action" rule but that approach might help with your voice program if it has enough processing options.
---
Note these are definitely not "ANet-approved" but merely intended to help without drawing unfriendly attention. Definitely avoid any program known or advertised for clearly nefarious purposes such as Cheat Engine or whatever they use for actual gathering bots as those will get you banned. Also don't try to sync-multibox by running the same voice recognition software on multiple computers that's just asking for trouble.
---
I don't know how viable consumer-grade software is but one other control option might be eye movement. I saw an almost-fully paralysed student attending *physics lectures* using a kind of grid chart to indicate symbols with their eyes (granted they had a human assistant to "read it out"). Maybe there's a software equivalent using facial recognition to press buttons when you look at them, the individual components definitely exist. Sorry if you've heard all this before but maybe it's outlandish enough you haven't considered it yet.
---
Seems strange. While gw2 isn't optimized indeed, I experienced same issues in both gw2 as well as on bf5 - too many net packages lead to longer rendering times. And I experienced on three machines. 
---
Unless my math is wrong, its about a 26% loss in crit chance going full diviner + leadership runes for a return of 103% boon duration.
---
So I guess it depends on how easily you can replace the lost crit with food/traits versus how much investment you needed to maintain 100% boon uptime via food/traits. I agree its a good stat set and is nice for Chrono/Renegade/Firebrand but my point is that its not game changing or suddenly opens up content to classes that couldn't participate before. Thus, the mad panic about how its time gated (a week) is unreasonable.
---
Must have skimmed through the message too fast this morning, my bad \ ^^

Chasing Tales: Asailea the Channeler appears to be bugged as finishing the Deed#3 does not provide the unlock needed to progress the collection. See images: [https://imgur.com/a/iKeyNcb](https://imgur.com/a/iKeyNcb)
---
Does it not at the very least make sense to let the reddit users know about stuff like this? It wasn't meant as a bug report. 
---
:l
---
I should really get my shit together and do more of this. 
---
Mostly my random acts of mesmer are impromptu. Like last weekend when I was getting HPs to finish up my Deadeye, and the same new player responded to map chat for the last 3 I needed.
---
After I was done (in Verdant Brink), I asked if they needed more, and as it turned out, they only had gotten one other than the ones they did with me...so I switched over to my mirage and together we went through and got them all the rest of the VB waypoints and HP.
---
Just helping and hearing how much of a help it was reminded me of my first free weeks in the HoT maps, and I was glad I could help someone through that process a bit.
---
Side-Note: You can combine any of the materials needed. You dont have to use 3x25 of the same material

1x25 Coral Orb

That was my first thought, came to find this comment, not disappointed!
---
Network does not affect fps. Something is probably bottlenecking your system.
---
I think this is a weak way to bring her back, it just reduce the overall impact of the episode 5 ending from a dire moment to a shock factor.
---
And we're not sure how dragon magic work, I mean, dragon can eat magic, but they seems to obtain only innate abilities from powerful entities, like gods or other dragons; Joko was a powerful necromancer, but still human after all, and it's power to awaken was bonded to his knowledge, not an innate ability.  
---
The fact that both Balthazar's sword and Zafirah can feel Balthazar's magic from Aurene, but no awakened can feel's Joko's power from her is also weird.  
---
You’ll do 900 days of dailies in one year? :thinking: 
---
Welp,  glad the title was a spoiler too.  
---
Amen
---
Yeah but you can't start in Thunderhead next episode because some people might not own the current story. The same reason why we will never really go back to Suns Refuge in any patch. This was content for Episode 4 and exists only within the borders of that patch. If you don't have it linked to your account, you will have no access and they can't build new story for that place in later episodes.
---
For this to happen, Arena Net would need to change their business model for living world. Either by scrapping the free unlock as long as the episode is live or make parts of each episode (maps) free for all. And both things won't happen.
---
Actually... I maybe would prefer a seasons pass kind of thing for living world. That we don't unlock the story for free, but can buy the complete season before the first episode goes live. This way, everyone who bought the season will have access to all episodes and then they can also start connecting the stories from all maps together. (And, much more important, can build on features that, with the current system, are immediately abandoned.)
---
No worries ahah, it happens to the best of us.
---
Putting this on SO is idiocy. The fights take place in limited space and require precise positioning, especially on CM. This shit is obviously cancer there, it will always be cancer and nothing more. I'm not even a game designer and I'd be ashamed beyond measure to release this in public.
---
Hello from the past, future people. I don’t know how many clicks deep I am anymore. All I know is I can’t quit now. 
---
Nobody in NA GvGs.  Its 99% dead.  There are a few small groups of people that will go to EOTM to fight if their matchups are boring though.  However this is mainly because the PPT guilds just run away after one fight.  Its a shame when you see groups of 40+ running away because they don't want to fight in a PvP mode.
---
Buying directly from the tp cheaper than the cheapest recipe with 9 gold doublons.
---
To 7
---
My concern was that you could just complete the same two or four regions on an alt delete him and then complete them again. Or just complete the fastest on every character you have and never do some that you don't like. Even with your changes you could skip up to 3 regions for your legendarys. You wouldn't do that if you're crafting a lot of them, but I you only make 3-4 their is not much reason to complete every region and instead doing the easy ones. My goal was to make the first legendary easier and to reduce the number of world completions needed overall.
---
To 8
---
Want I meant was that even with less boss health and damage taken some mechanic can still easily wipe you while others become trivial. So dhuum will still be harder on easy than most bosses on normal because greens will still just kill you. Also even mechanics where the damage will be reduced don't always mean that the boss gets much easier. For example the black at deimos would have to do about 90% less damage for them to not wipe the group if it covers the platform. For the hard modes I didn't mean that having to play a mechanic like vale guardian greens or gorseval updrafts is bad. Just that with increased fight duration it gets harder and harder to do so especially if people go down to other mechanics. Finally some mechanics might just become to strong like corruption from matthias with to much damage you won't make it to alive without support. For dungeons it's been a while since I did them so I can't say for sure but I'm pretty sure that their would be problems as well.
---
My point is simply scaling %boss health and %damage taken is not a good way to make easy/hard modes.
---
PvP died when aNet introduced dragonhunter guard.
---
Got to put that up to the feel of the class:
---
Tempest feels toned down for what was essentially an Avatar State inspired class. And it didn't feel all that different from basic elementalist. Shouts aren't, visually, that impactful and warhorn is, well, a warhorn. I loved tempest, but I love spellweaver more. Firebrand has a similar problem, I think. And I love renegade and not sure why people don't like that one as much other than it's not overly boon heavy.
---
Chronomancers, however, control freaking time and create big, flashy wells. I mean, that's a very appealing play-fantasy and adding in the huge amount of boons they generate(d) and shared, just made them a lot more acceptable to play.

For masteries take what makes sense for you. My recommendations for rushing are:
---
Tyira: Either _Pact commander_ for auto-loot or _Fractal Attunement_ for fractal related stuff.
---
HoT: Gliding.
---
PoF: What ever mount seems the most important to you.
---
Marauder gear is also excellent for open worlding as a Tempest, imo at least. :)
---
&gt; So how do we fix this?
---
Nothing short of a GW3 I'm afraid
---
I normally dislike fan art but, I really like this. 
---
Pretty much this
---
I'm glad Rox's found somewhere she truly wants to be, but I don't like the idea of her breaking off with us so soon :c
---
Never said it was fine. I just said it made sense.
---
You also have to switch off your outfit if you're wearing one.
---
I applaud you for spinning this elaborate theory, but I don't deem it very likely... you make it all line up somehow, but it works in incredibly random ways and causes Kralk a lot of pain. 
---
Besides, Glint would never have fought Kralkatorrik directly if she were really loyal to him. She wouldn't have made a spear out of his spine. I also don't believe that Kralk would have ever seen a world without himself if he had such a vicious and loyal lieutenant as Glint at his side - he would always have won, no matter what. 
---
Besides: No, it's completely fine that Kralkatorrik would still ask Glint for help AFTER the ritual cleansed her. The corruption was mental, the purification likely not visible to him. He might very well have had his vision only moments after Glint was purified, because in that very moment, the Forgotten changed the course of history and created the most powerful and wise ally the Tyrian races have ever known. As far as we can say, he only found out about her purification and her betrayal much later. 
---
I recently bought the expansions, and I finished my core story. I don't own any living world stuff. I watched the season 1 recap at the npc.
---
I am for sure buying the living world seasons after I get paid at the end of the month, but I'm a bit torn over whether to get started on HoT now or play everything in sequence... Does it matter that much that it's worth waiting?
---
I kinda want to get into either HoT or PoF areas just to get hero points, since I still need to unlock chrono and mirage.
---
Am I being crazy about this?
---
I am more intrigued about the plans for LW5 she shortly mentioned. I really hope that Arena Net takes risks with their story, as long as they don't go overboard with time travel shenanigans. 
---
The deal on the expansions right now is a good one. They do occasionally go on sale so you're not screwed if you decide not to buy them now, but it's unlikely you will get a better deal by waiting.
---
HoT is typically $20-$30, definitely not always $10.
---
How living world works is if you login while an episode is active, you unlock it for free. To unlock old episodes, you need to pay 200 gems for each of them. This equates to about $2.50, but keep in mind you can also convert ingame gold to gems at reasonable rates.
---
The only unplayable lw content is season 1, due to how it was structured. Seasons 2, 3, and the first four episodes of 4 would need to be unlocked this way if you don't have access to them. If you logged on during the time those episodes were active but didn't have access due to not having the relevant expansion, they will be unlocked once you get the expansion.
---
For the higher tiers of the expansions, they add some nice stuff, but nothing you need. The expansions and the older lw episodes are the only content locked behind a paywall.  All other gemstore items are just for convenience or style, none of it necessary.
---
I have a more simple design I had for this too I wish I could like it for you to check it thanks for the input :) 
---
No, that's a reddish-brown color associated particularly with monochrome photographs of the 19th and early 20th centuries. I think they mean serotonin.
---
GW2 scales horribly with newer hardware and you're going to see bigtime diminishing returns with increasingly expensive components. 3ish years ago I upgraded from an AMD R9 290 to a 980Ti and saw zero noticeable performance increase in this game. Zero. I can almost certainly guarantee that you will not notice a difference upgrading from 1080Ti to 2080Ti. Save your money.
---
Been a minute, but PvE Staff, Fire, Air, and Arcane with sigil utilities has served me very well over the years. Dodge works great for extra spell casts and defense, and combos put out a lot of conditions and boons with yourself and when others join in. Happy fun times had by all.
---
Actually I think we wounded his eye from attacking it. I think Aurene did "die" but Jokos magic will revive her. They can't do a story where Aurene dies unless they are going introduce another powerful being we can't kill Kralkatorrik without her.
---
They scale, it’s going to be fine?  
---
It appears as if the majority of people prefer to not spend more time on readjusting their positioning, particularly when precise movement is required in crucial moments. Not that it necessarily prevents the encounter from succeeding - the change you experience with Slippery Slope is simply too drastic compared to all the other instabilities. I suppose they generally prefer changes to actual mechanics of the fight over changes to fundamental ways the game works. 
---
100% not worth it. 1080TI SLI performance &gt; 2080 TI. 
---
Heart of Thorns unlocks the maguuma jungle maps, the HoT story, the revenant class,  the first set of elite specializations (side/upgrades for each class), and several masteries including the useful gliding ability and autoloot.
---
Path of fire unlocks the crystal desert maps, the PoF story, the second set of elites, and all mounts.
---
Living world content is story/map content that takes place between expansions/base game but will require a seperate purchase to unlock unless you logged in during each chapter's release window. Season 1 is unavailable, Season 2 requires the base game, Season 3 requires you to have HoT, and Season 4 requires PoF.
---
Every release/expansion also comes with a bevy of weapons/armors, unique materials, special stat combinations, and event metas. Breaking all these down would take a lot of effort.
---
You mean the one with ice around it? Sadly, while it was a better attempt, it's not quite well designed either. The image was poorly cropped, and I'm pretty sure the image was squeezed to fit the char, which also didn't look well either. But don't give up! Everyone started where you are now, just keep on going, seek feedback and improve! :D
---
She had a role in L3 Ep. 2 when Balthazar showed up in the guise of Lazarus to "protect" Aurene. 
---
He's the magnet / oil adventure npc in the SW corner of the map.
---
I don't know about others, but my mouse allows me to set a "random" delay feature between presses. I discovered it when creating music macros and also assigning Mount-up macros for each mount.
---
So in effect, this random delay could have the button pressed anywhere between 3 seconds and 3.5 seconds after the first "click," in increments of 0.01 seconds. So I could take a swing at an ore node in 3.00 seconds flat, or 3.16 seconds, or 3.48 seconds if I were to set up a macro for such a thing. That way the delay isn't always a static 3.5 seconds or some such, but appears much more human in reaction time.
---
Not a helpful feature for creating music macros or for mounting up, however, so I haven't tested the feature out myself. But it seems potentially really useful for disabled gamers that don't want to trigger an automated detection system or something.
---
Read your comment thinking "Well really, how bad can it be?". 
---
You are a smarter person than I am.
---
Who? :(
---
With mounts not anymore lol.
---
I think Aurene isnt dead, she ingested Joko so that leads me to believe she will come back, also I can see the next expansion being the last of GW2 tbh, seems right for the commander to die at the end of next/last ex-pack, would be a good natural end to his story.
---
Dont upgrade its not worth it, you will not have any noticable differences , both config are already really good for this game. This is juts how the game is. I play on a 1080 + I7 6700K and ive played on a computer friend with a 2080 TI on a friend computer ( we have the same type of screen 144hz monitor 2K ) and i cant notice any difference, it's totally not worth it for gw2
---
&gt;ing seriously since Im considering if someone is using 2080Ti can give me some comments about the new GPU :(
---
For GW2 you wont see any difference as the game is very CPU bound. However for other games that are more optimized the 2080 does roughly 12% better than the 1080TI, and the 2080TI does has roughly 28% general performance on the 1080TI. But given its vastly more expensive the price to performance ratio is really low on the 2080 and 2080TI. Mostly because the main benefits of the new architecture (Tensor cores and Raytracing cores) are not yet supported by anything outside of their demo.  in the future they might be worth it but right now and atleast for another year i do not see many, if any, games release with that hardware support. So i would personally not spend the extra money. I would say get one of the more overclocked 1080TI's to get the most bang for your buck while retaining highend performance.   
---
Rumor does have it that anthem will support it. So when that releases in less than a month we will get some insight to what performance the new architecture can bring.  
---
TLDR: Buy overclocked 1080TI to get the most of your money or wait till anthem which supposedly releases to get better insight into the performance that the 20series actually brings to games.
---
 I'm think this part says the exact opposite:
---
* You **cannot** use macros to create skill chains in *any* competitive environment, including PvP, WvW, open world activities, races, etc.
---
I just assume the etc. part means all the rest. But it does seem odd to me they say "open world activities" and not PvE in that regard, so you might be right. It's hard when they leave it a bit open.
---
Thanks! I was super SUPER happy to have this pop up right after coming out of the last instance since I wasn't really thrilled with what had happened and this sort of made up for it since I really miss interacting with Kasmeer and Jory. Still not the same but better than nothing!
---
I still feel horrible every time I see Ceera at the entrance to AB. The first time I talked with her after HoT launched, and she remembered and hated me for what happened to Tonn, I was legitimately struck with actual remorse and empathy. 
---
Nope, I don't play heavy armors much so please correct me if wrong someone.
---
Helmet is PvP
---
Shoulders ???
---
Chest PvE Legendary 
---
Gloves PvE Legendary

Pants ???

Boots PvE Legendary

This is my [Tempest build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vFAQJBIhdSfJ00A25A4fJQHBWaAMhCQA4D6eZ7sjWidwMIGA-jhRBAB4pn4hTAAAPAAKV/5KlfmpEEA-e) that I usually use, I mainly play my elementalist in story and open world stuff because I frankly have enough other characters for instanced content.
---
For utility skills, Lightning Flash is always there simply so I can get out of bad stuff if my stunbreaks (like from Overloads) are down and I get knocked down or such. Glyph of Storms is nice for either damage (Fire/Air) or if you want to blind the mobs you've grouped up (Earth). "Feel The Burn!" I use mainly because it's the only instant shout skill, and I can use it while overloading without breaking the overload channel. Elemental glyph so I can have a sturdy earth elemental tank. Sometimes I switch out Glyph of Storms for Arcane Shield depending on the situation.
---
I use air traits because Fresh Air, and Water traits because having a heal/cleanse on attunment swap is awesome, and having auras apply to more than just you is nice for when you go into group events. It's only a small heal on auras, but since you give quite a few out through overloads and Air-3 on dagger, those small heals can add up.
---
So TL;DR: Despite going power glasscannon, I run a build that does give a bit utility and team support, because in open world events, you never know if one of your heals can save people.
---
If you remember Zafirah as a generic NPC, I don't think you were really paying attention to the episode  as you were playing it. It's fair if you subjectively like Kas and Marjory more, but you're really not at all judging these more recent characters fairly. It sounds more like that as soon as you realized your favorites were not in an episode, you breezed through that one without a lot of interest in whoever was speaking and what they were saying. That's not a good baseline for judging how a character is written and how much "of a wash" they are. 
---
Could you post your healing build plz?
---
gpu stays at 60% ish, frames somewhere 40+ in fight. Frames more or less stay there, only drop i've had so far is with fireworks or snow areas(gw2 particle system is just horrible)
---
My boyfriend and I play WvW together occasionally, usually to go after a specific reward skin. We both are obviously on the same IP as we're sitting across the room from one another and hooked into the same router, but on different computers. How robust a detection system are they talking? Are we at risk for being flagged as "multi-boxers" in such a case?
---
The buff stays with you if you switch to another instance of the map. Another tip i can give is to find someone with keys you didnt get and port zo them via port to friend (if your buff is still up you can loot all the secret chests in the ruins) 
---
But if your Light wears off, you cannot loot the final chest for the dungeon, or any other little chests along the way, so this is not a fix at all.
---
Unless it puts you into a new map, because then the rooms are different. And you might not be able to get into the right rooms. 
---
It was quite fun as we were discovering that new instability, it reminded me a lot of Super Mario games that I played years ago, and I personally would not mind having to deal with it a few more times, but not more than that. 
---
I like the fact of adding a new challenge that players have not seen before, or only recently, and it is honestly refreshing. However, I would probably not want to have to deal with it in every daily fractals for days, like we did for SA (social awkwardness) prior to the 8th of January patch.
---
The Overseer's Cave, for instance, requires to do South. It's a closed cave that won't open until the event chain is completed.
---
Removed: Getting a lot of reports about the title being a spoiler. Removed a similar thread the other day for the same reason... I think knowing what happens makes it seem like more of a spoiler than it is but better to be safe than sorry. Please feel free to post with another title. 
---
He looks over encumbered.
---
From what I understand of GW2. CPU is the biggest problem with graphics. I would say investing in a better CPU and cooling system. 
---
Those are my problems at least.
---
This would be great for me, as I've started a character several times over the years but never get very far. Would probably get a lot farther with some people to play with. I can start a fresh character at some point. Just gotta redownload when I get the chance. I'm working the next 3 days. 
---
tyria can't be a fractal. if current dragon rise is a repeat of the last one, then we'd have lupicus going extinct right about now, seers and dwarves alive etc
---
cycle =/= loop
---
fractal must be within the mists, tyria isn't the mists. pockets of time in jahai are pockets nonetheless - parts of the mists residing in real world, the veil being so thin you can basically enter them freely, same like in the tombs of primeval kings or wvw gates. also the tyrian space isn't the mists, but as everything that can be found in real worlds, mists also have it. thus there are astral landscapes in the mists which may be frozen in time, like the comet in mistlock sanctuary
---
Which, has always been this way and nothing has changed
---
Those people don\`t want to play the game, they just want to get what they want as fast as possible and the game itself doesn\`t matter at all.
---
I’m pretty sure I found my way in by glitching wuth the griffon and springer though. It’s been a while.
---
Poor, poor mole. But I'll take anything over zadoroiny in the armory
---
Something else that struck me about this: Glint and Aurene couldn't see past their own deaths.  Kralk CAN.  He saw a world without him.
---
This suggests two things.  First, that power is key to foresight.  Glint and Aurene didn't have enough power to see past their deaths, but Kralk does.  The more power you have, the more pieces of the puzzle you're able to see.  Thus, second, Kralk's vision is the "superior" one.  Glint and Aurene's visions were just secondary visions.  Imagine a chess board, and all three dragons are pieces.  Glint and Aurene saw where their pieces would go and be defeated.  Kralk saw the whole board and the final score.  And that final score was "Kralk loses."
---
Also, trapping Kralk in a time loop wouldn't fix the situation, because then no one would be regulating the magic.  The whole point of replacing Kralk with Aurene is that you still need to regulate the flow of magic in Tyria.  Trapping Kralk in a loop means all the magic of his domain that isn't currently inside him is now unregulated.
---
We HAVE to have a magic regulator or it's game over, so taking Kralk out of the picture - by death or time loop - means we HAVE to have Aurene or game over.  So if Kralk's superior vision was a world without Kralk, that means Aurene is coming back.  Which is fine, as long as ANet doesn't make it TOO contrived.
---
I don’t think Kralk domain of magic is Time, but perhaps Possibilities. Crystal has many facets, both literally and figuratively, gazing into crystal from different angle may yield a different perspective. Prophecies may not be definitive but rather the most probable. 
---
Make [The Moot](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Moot) and [sing](https://youtu.be/mdlyEC2wcQQ) to her.
---
Yeah that is one thing I would love to see come back somehow. Both of those events were really fun.
---
The ancient karka event.
---
It only happened once and was a laggy mess but it was cool fighting the boss and watching everyone work together to complete the event.
---
&gt; Actually I think we wounded his eye from attacking it. 
---
That's what I though at first, but when I watched the cinematic, I noticed the eye looked fine when he delivered that final blast. Could be a goof though...
---
It's a MINERAL Dragon, Marie!
---
Don’t do it. 1080ti in sli is probably just about the same as a single 2080ti in any game outside of GW2 the only major thing is you then can do is ray tracing. But non of this really matters in gw2
---
Looks like a Super Mario game.
---
It is!  I'll have a post detailing it tomorrow once I've got it up! 😊
---
I've played every elite spec and know what classes bring to the table, but I still want some opinions. I'm set for my dps options, I have 2 power and 2 condi classes to clear every encounter.
---
I have a druid and support scourge. For my final character I want another support or hybrid dps + a boon. I can't decide between heal or hybrid firebrand/revenant, chronomancer and support tempest.
---
This will be mainly for raids which I've started to do regularly.
---
If any arenanet devs are reading this. This new instabilities are fun and most important its something new and different which players need to learn control and adjust to. Good job. Dont listen to these haters. If this didnt happened they would cry that nothing new is added. Thank you for not making this dead game. Keep making us uncomfortable. Thats how you keep us 
---
This actually gave me a thought... What if that's exactly *why* he can scry into the future? 
---
Maybe in the next ep we completely blind him and when he thus loses his future sight, we deal with him? An outlandish theory, bur possible o.o
---
I think Anet has a different idea of what they want fractals to be compared to what me, my friends and my guildmates want them to be.  Anet seems to want them to just be an RNG cluster f\*\*\*.  I mean they made the instabilities able to be "countered" with specific compositions and/or traits/skills but doing that in a PUG?  Forget it.  Even doing that in organized groups is an absolute pain since you need AR to do T4s.  No one is going to run a specific composition in a PUG to counter the instabs so they are just a RNG mess.
---
I would much prefer they remove them completely and actually make T2-T4 more difficult OR at least go back to how they used to be with instabs fixed on specific fractals OR randomize them ever 3 months or so not every f\*\*\*ing day.
---
fyi, there's also the similar  
---
[Witch's Hat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Witch%27s_Hat) which is available from Candy Corn Cobs
---
&gt; Losing control of your character is not an enjoyable mechanic imo.
---
Main point right there. Which is why I was against this shit before even released and tested. Oh well.
---
Yea, i play Sword/Dagger too (only berseker 'cause why not), and it's both powerful and really fun too play. But you need to get use to weaver first and you must plan your attacks. 
---
What's very cool with sword tho is that it has a lot of mobility and dodges and you always have a skill to cast.
---
I like new SA better than old. No more agony, and I've not had an issue with trolling yet. If someone does troll you, just move.
---
I decided to play against type a bit, so my Sylvari thief is Priory. But my plan is for my Thief to become a Daredevil, so I imagine him as a scholarly martial artist type. Cycle of dusk.
---
they were talking about afk farmers that dont respond. Not sure why you need to mention that players who play their account actively while farming and are responsive while doing so in this context wont get banned.
---
Great! When I get home and have some time this evening I will create the guild and send PM's to anyone interested so we can sync up.
---
&gt; But it seems potentially really useful for disabled gamers that don't want to trigger an automated detection system or something.
---
Friendly warning of course that this will **NOT** stand up to extended scrutiny. It should avoid rudimentary auto-flaggers and a sufficiently wide interval combined with **sparing** use should make it vanish in your more general gameplay activity. And again: if the software you use to implement this is involved in any large-scale botting you might get banned as collateral damage. **Only** use in case of disability or other impediments *not* as a general convenience tool!
---
&gt; Fixed a bug in which the Hammer's Hoard point of interest could not be activated from outside of the gate.
---
LOL
---
You manage to surprise me with how much of a cunt you can be at all times. Go jerk off to your tp flipping.
---
Have you tried not being a trumped up lab rat?
---
Not sure if that's a bug seeing as how there were several other story instances like that before... Either way I didn't find this batch too hard to solo and I didn't do a particularly good job at it anyways.
---
&gt; Where does Joko come into play?
---
Yeah, I wondered about that too!
---
I just read [this post](https://redd.it/aeuguc) where OP points out that if Kralk really killed Aurene, then *he* should now be the one with Joko's powers. So if Aurene is really dead, she should not be able to make Joko-style comeback.
---
So I like your idea that she is going to use that power for something else entirely possibly reviving the other Dragons! We do indeed still need to deal with the magical disturbance caused by their deaths, so that would be an interesting way to tie up that plotline.
---
I did 100 CM last night and my group spent a good 5 minutes missing the mistlock singularity before the first boss. It was funny at first, but got old fast. Strangely, it didn't hugely affect the fights themselves...
---
Currency exchange I guess
---
Gay dredge confirmed? Truly Anet is dropping the realest of lore bombs here
---
I always love playing more Support roles in open world mainly Chrono for the mad boon up keep but I have been playing Auramancer ever since Tempest was released. 
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vFAQJBIhdSfJ0fJWhJ4gJwhJWEBshAwA4+52Wjr1ViOwG4AA-jBSBQBFSPAlU/5KK9AwJAgMKDMjSQis/wEfAAkCYUtWA-e
---
That is my current build but with the introduction on those absolutely wonderful Diviner Stats with this last patch I'll be swapping my gear over to that.
---
I highly doubt its code issue. Judging by how much priority anet gives to open world pve compared to raids /fractals/wvw/pvp, its an issue of them not giving a fuck
---
What if I get a friend and start pushing you off disappearing platforms just for fun? 
---
I agree with the Monstrosity! LMAO. That's just awesome! 
---
I always thought the Ventari Tablet and the benevolent intentions and love of Ventari and Ronan somehow cleansed the tree as it grew (which is weird but really poetic I think). That's also why sylvari are humanoids, the Pale Tre copied Ronan. Where did you see the implications of the Forgotten purifying the seed ?
---
I must of missed that. Thank you for the reply.
---
I agree. I really enjoy the Norn starting area. It feels the most well-paced in that it starts insulated, opens up later, and has tons of events in a relatively small area. 
---
I’m actually okay with the serpentine jewel acquisition as well, and the tradeoff decision on stat-changing my Chrono’s gear versus getting Dragonsblood weapons. It’s my plan to do everything eventually, and now I have a daily activity that takes me to the new map. Also, I realize I only need to stat change like 3 pieces of armor and get a couple Diviners trinkets and that’s enough boon duration with sigil and runes. Berserker and Assassin stats are still best for damage.
---
That's actually was my original route when I was level 13. I had done the vigil quests on another character so I knew about the portal and when I looked up where salamander drakes were I figured this was the safest way to get to blaze ridge steppes (since the salamanders were at the southern part of the map near the entrance to fields of ruin.) 
---
So when I took him from plains of Ashford through the branded area I was like "hmm I dont think I went this way when I was low level..." as I had to clear waves of monsters to keep him from getting 1 tapped. 
---
The decision to go southward to follow my old footsteps was on impulse and was a fun decision. I really love ebonhawke I wish it was a popular hub to hang out in.
---
ATTENTION DOWNVOTERS: THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A FUCKING JOKE
---
Your title implies something sad happens, which is a spoiler... 
---
Thank you! :)
---
That's a great idea with modifying the pauses.  Voice Attack lets you do that and it seems safe.  Usable I think in any game and got it recommended from a disabled gamers website.  
---
I did hear a little about eye movement hardware and software.  When I was really bad, I thought about it but the price for both was out of my range.  And I try to retain hope that I will get better though it gets hard sometimes after two years and seeing so many doctors.
---
On the other hand, actually being able to play GW2 freely and for as long and when I wanted again...wow.  I miss that greatly.  So your reminder is something I will try to keep and remember.  Maybe prices will come down and it will be something to help keep spirits up if my health doesn't improve fully the way I'd like.
---
Thank you for writing this.  I appreciate this.  Have a great day!
---
I would be interested in this as I'm looking to level a new character up in a traditional way without tomes, scrolls, or crafting so that I can make sure I actually connect with the character before getting to endgame and not liking it or understanding it as well as my other alts. 
---
Acquisition method aside....can we get the ability to deposit them into material storage???
---
what other profession would... benefit from it as much? firebrand and druid like healing power, firebrand and renegade like condition damage, tempest needs healing power, scourge needs healing power. i can't think of a single other support spec that it would be competitive for 
---
Maybe well try that with our lil guild god I can see it going horribly wrong.
---
I don't mean to be that person, but I do hope you asked to use that art, as I don't see a proper credit (just leaving the URL in the image isn't considered consent or free use or a credit).
---
The artist is Gears2Gnomes - https://twitter.com/gears2gnomes | http://gears2gnomes.tumblr.com/
---
He's generally very nice about using his pieces, but I think everyone prefers if you ask/credit properly.
---
what exactly is this item? is it giving random buffs?
---
nice rickroll
---
It took me about 5 years to get back into the game. There was a period when heart of thorns came out where I played for almost a month kinda out of obligation but it took until now for me to feel the same addiction I used to
---
&gt; I can see it going horribly wrong.
---
that's what makes it interesting
---
Not sure how your networks works...
---
If you connect to your laptop remotely (through VPN or whatever), and launch gw2, then it's fully transparent for GW2 servers as what they see is your laptop running your game from its location... But this wouldn't help you with performance, it would actually make it even worse...
---
The only reason you would gain performance would be if you were running GW2 on a different PC (installed in local on your remote PC), but then they are able to see where the connection come from and so it's considered as sharing, somehow, unless you can proves it's you who is using it 100% of times that is.
---
Ah you're right! Sorry!
---
YMMV.
---
i recently went from a 1080 Ti to 2080 Ti (CPU: 2700X) and saw a noticeable improvement in GW2 performance at 4K. even with the 2080 Ti, my system is routinely hit 90%+ GPU utilization.
---
with that said, situations that were CPU bound (large crowds, WvW zergs, map metas etc) didn't change very much.
---
Now let me tell you exactly what's going on with these comments. I mean, you and me and everyone knows it anyways, but it needs to be said so it is written down somewhere:
---
He's jealous that people do fractals on a daily basis and make some money. Quick, fun gameplay.
---
He's not good enough for that, that's why he hides his insecurities and disabilities behind insults like elitist gold farmers and speedrunning (just as a reminder: GDQ is live atm, it's a good time for speedruns.)
---
So because he's not good enough for daily fractals, and also jealous of the money to be made and fun to be had, he wants everyone to be miserable and stop playing.
---
Then maybe, just maybe fractals become this one-time thing that you do once in a blue moon and you can laugh about shit instabilities, because they are something new and interesting and not something that just annoys the shit out of you on a daily basis.
---
These comments are pretty much everywhere, because these idiots are very vocal about content they do not play and problems that do not concern them because they are not good enough for the game.
---
End of that take on that stupid comment. This is a trash tier community sometimes, not gonna lie. Parts of it, at least.
---
the problem isn't ascended gear, it's agony resistance. if you can't bring it to fractals, the most popular high end content in the game, then you aren't geared 
---
You can't interact with her, so I doubt it :(
---
Yeah with the novelty wardrobe they could do all sorts of cool stuff
---
Then I'll move away, easy.
---
Pretty sure the achievements are making those prices.
---
He’s not wrong. DS meta is a lot less popular than it used to be, at least on NA. At peak hours you still get full ones, successful runs, but there are other times when there’s no instance of the map running the meta.
---
Are you opening the correct chest?  There's a hidden resplendent chest that needs to be revealed via the Light of Deldrimor skill before it can be looted.
---
Sure thing I was not sure how to do it sorry 
---
I choose to believe charr have humanoid genitalia and that would be even worse for a tiny asura.
---
Performs like potato in both.
---
Now, how about those mines and oil spills? :)
---
I just stopped doing fractals all together, the "gimmicks" grow old really fast. More of a nuisance than a challenge.
---
Rather than Probability or Time I'd go with something like Vision or something to do with seeing the future.
---
Kralk interacting with the Mists is a big part of what makes him so dangerous, but all indications point to that being a result of him absorbing Balthazar's magic, and not necessarily being a part of his domain (if that's what you mean by powerset). Replace Kralk with any other ED, and they would likely gain the same ability of Mists tampering that Kralk got from absorbing Kralk.
---
It also brings into question on whether or not ED are able to upgrade their domains. They can manipulate the domains of dead EDs by absorbing their magic, but are they fully in control of said domains or are they just using what power they can from it?
---
Your theory does bring up an interesting thought though. Clearly, Kralkatorrik, Glint and Aurene are focused on their visions, especially Kralk after he saw his defeat. With Aurene's absorption of Mordremoth's magic, could she invade Kralk's mind; not to try to take over his mind or body, but to plant a false prophecy? He's understandably focused on self-preservation; if he sees a vision where he triumphs over the good guys, would he question whether the vision was false or not (again, assuming that Aurene is not really dead).  
---
&gt; Unfortunately at some point those who enjoy challenge and competition (in general and specifically) in instanced content will have to accept that GuildWars2 isn't the right game for them.
---
Word for word what Deaxxon said in his stream the other day. Guess you're right.
---
Dragon minions consume and are empowered by magic the same way dragons are. We actually see dragon minions becoming larger and more powerful upon consuming magic, and it's stated in the PS that the more magic a dragon minion is given when corrupted, the more powerful and more intelligent it is. Similarly, it is stated elsewhere that the more power a minion is given, the more draconic it turns into (hence the appearance of the Risen Knights / Unchained Kingpins being humans who were warped into a draconian appearance with wings and a new dragon head; or the warped appearance of the Mouth of Zhaitan).
---
I mean, Tequatl is unlikely to have been born a dragon. I want to say there was a dev comment that Tequatl was originally a hylek, though it's been ages since I heard the comment so for all I know the dev meant the name "Tequatl" was of hylek origin. But with no dragons beyond Glint in Tyria in GW1 (and the dead Bone Dragons, I suppose) where did the Claw of Jormag come? And The Shatterer is hollow, while the Shadow of the Dragon is pure plant. These are "dragons" but yet they are not biologically so. All the same, Tequatl nearly replaced Zhaitan in Season 1 before we killed it canonically.
---
Point being, all indication shows that "dragons" can be created by giving a ton of magic to a dragon minion, just as much as they can be born. And as you say, the Pale Tree is a dragon minion - specifically, a dragon champion - that has been purified of Mordremoth's corruption.
---
Farming Silverwastes or Istan for Gold to buy materials to craft your first ascended gear. Do Fractals because sometimes you get ascended gear drops, even in the lower tiers. Check out the specialisation tab, you get ascended weapons a lot cheaper this way. Maybe try raiding, you don't need ascended for that.
---
I main Ele, and am around your level. 3k hours, 400Li, etc.  
---
Open world PvE usually means going down two different routes.  
---
For dps events (bosses, chak, tarir) i stay on weaver and do dps rotations since i don't have to worry about aggro.  
---
On solo/roaming content, i almost exclusively play S/D or D/D tempest.  
---
D/D priority, with scepter for ranged encounters.  
---
I mix up the traits alot more, speccing earth and water because i don't care about the minimal dps loss.  
---
I keep storm signet, it gives dps in fire/air and blinds in earth.  
---
Lightning flash for mobility, and lastly i often run a shout in the third slot. (it heals when specced, and gives an aura)  
---
FGS for even more movement, or overload for safety.
---
I have 6 different fully ascended raid-ready classes. Most of the time I’m on Chrono, and most of my attention is to keeping up with changes to Chrono. I even have a Quickness Firebrand ready to go if our raid comp ever changes away from using Chrono, but so far it’s not happening. Chrono is the meta.
---
Also it's the only convienent and guaranteed way to obtain Exquisite Serpentine Jewel, the other methods are RNGs. And you get exactly enough for one Diviner's Inscription or Insignia.
---
CPU does not equal frames, Graphics card = frames.
---
Can dredge have optical implants, or panscopic monocles?
---
I don't know specifically who you are (though I have a fair idea), but that's not it nor would it have been my response (or it might've been misconstrued). We need the claim information to process extras releases (otherwise we have no idea if you'll ever do it). All of our packages are insured when they're put in the post - regardless of fault. 
---
I have an active list of anyone who has placed a damaged query with us, and we hold items for the duration of the hold period. Once you get the claim information, as per legal reasons we've clarified in several spots, you can either choose to keep the damaged copies and the insured compensation from the post office, or transfer it over to us to cover damages and we'll work through the remainder of the claims process.
---
Nope, not that easy. I'll make sure to body block you so you cant move before the platform disappears. It's called trolling. And there's people who derive enjoyment of it. Kick them all you want. They'll do it to the next group.
---
lol 12K HP twig. My power weaver is sitting on about 20K HP and beats the living bejeezus out of pretty much whatever I decide needs beating on. Go marauder, use sword, don't look back. 
---
Also at current cob prices the Wizard's Hat would be cheaper (if it was available)
---
It’s supposed to be guaranteed. Some folks have said they didn’t get it, but I’m wondering if they opened the right chest. There’s at least 3 chests in the treasure room, and I think the hidden one gives the guaranteed jewels.
---
random fun fact: the graveling can drop purple plate.
---
It just been fixed a few minutes ago!  
---
Extract from Patch Notes:  
---
* Fixed a bug in which the Hammer's Hoard point of interest could not be activated from outside of the gate.
---
How do I specifically farm Silverwastes or (what is Istan?) ?
---
I'm crafting the special Reaper Greatsword and Caladborg (can be changed into several things but I'm going for GS as well)
---
So just do daily fractals? How do I get higher agony resistance though? Any easy way to get ascended earrings easily? And I only have 1 open slot on my rings for resistance, I've seen people have like 3? How??
---
i mean its not even like we get soo much fking gold for the afford we put in the fractals.
---
for example the new fractal:
---
it takes like 20 mins in best case 20 damn mins and rewards you the same as aquatic ruins
---
i've used a double clicker macro for mystic forge sometimes. it depends if i have alot to throw into it. if its just a bag full of items i'll just double click normally
---
I miss a customizable UI :/
---
It's true, if you want to have an easier time joining groups for high-end pve content most other classes will be better than a necro.
---
Yeah the hidden one is the one that gives it, along with a chance from the hidden chests in the other rooms.
---
Im guessing the meta jewel isnt 100% then?
---
You can TTF into one of the rooms before the room with the POI and start picking up the plates at that point to get to the room with the POI. Obviously you can't get the hidden chests since you didn't start the puzzle. 
---
Its not bugged, it seems like only the players that you last hit the mobs to get the rewards. I camp 10 minutes there with spike character to test that and I stole the plate really frequently. So know I only do this with character that can spike Dps and wait when Hp is low.
---
The only level 80s in our guild are all idiots who don't know how to play the game except one. That one is NOT me. I really want to try this now. We have like 5 newb friends who all started playing I'm sure I can get one to follow us for adventure reasons lmfao.
---
I'd say no, while it's the most powerful card in the world currently, the price for performance is way too high imo, most of the money goes into the ray tracing feature. An "1160" card has been leaked which is supposedly same performance as the 2060 but cheaper (and without the ray tracing), so hopefully an 1180 will be released too.
---
&gt; I’d *love* to see Slippery Slope activated for raids. The amount of backlash would be monumental. 
---
Put it in PvP &amp; WvW for a week / weekend event.
---
Imagine the horror
---
While it is pretty likely to be temporary, it doesn't have to be. We never needed Aurene specifically, we merely need a replacement for at least two but ideally four to six Elder Dragons - something Aurene couldn't do alone anyways. No matter what, we always needed at least one more replacement so that we could then kill the deep sea dragon.
---
For all intents and purposes, the plot can leave Aurene dead forever. So long as we get a replacement for Zhaitan or Mordremoth going (or another dragon to replace Kralkatorrik). If we get *one* replacement, whether it's replacing a dead dragon or Kralkatorrik, then we can kill Kralkatorrik and continue the plot.
---
So while I would agree it is very likely Aurene will return in some form, eventually, in Season 5 or later, the plot can turn into a "okay Aurene's gone and not coming back, where can we get another replacement?" and only touch Aurene in passing until she comes back.
---
omg, that sounds amazing lol
---
Then what’s the issue?
---
Edit: no you’re getting downvoted for your poor attitude. If you had said “hey guys check out the performance using this hardware” it would be different
---
so there is, in fact, only a dozen of us still in spvp, no meme, no lie there's 24 people still pvping
---
No one should be going full diviner. You get so much boon duration from runes and sigil of concentration that you only need a few other pieces of gear switched to Diviner’s. Even if you’re aiming for 100% boon duration, you can still afford to have Berserkers and/or Assassins gear in the mix. I love the new stat combo, but I’m not gonna go overboard with it. It’ll just help me optimize for boon uptime without needing any Commanders gear or sacrificing too much damage.
---
There are other games out there that do gear grind better: GW2 has an absolutely shitty gear system and putting progression into it makes the game weaker because the devs are pushing players to spend time on something that isn't done well. 
---
Make me grind D3-like gear, where that grind will lead to a fun result. But GW2 gear, where I get a tiny bit of extra stats by running around in lvl 30 maps, avoiding foes and chopping down trees? Blish, please.
---
It in the actual forum posts. In the examples of  allowed macros. 
---
The very first vision from Aurene was proven wrong. Mordremoth never made a clone of Trahearne.
---
Just saying.
---
It’s probably an NPC-only outfit. There’s a lot of those out there.
---
She still has the tippy taps
---
You can use gw2timer and have the same stuff in a secondary screen, it is just inconvenient.
---
Low key i hope they add unlimited use/time Basenji goggles or some shit. Throw ALL the shade 
---
Interesting, I can't wait to see a Deadeye build !
---
What about them?  You can complete those two achievements within like three metas. 
---
I would so love it if this was true. I like how this theory is consistent with elder dragons having dominion over 2 domains of magic. I also love the implication that the heroes will have to use some kind of time travelling to beat Kralkatorrik ala Avengers 4 and time stone shenanigans (Maybe, who knows). It's fitting too at how the last episode ended. Queue Aurene saying "Commander, I don't feel so good".
---
It was fun to me. I made lots of mistakes but nothing as threatening. So this is a new challenge with this kind of instability, yet lots of fun to play and try to position yourself right. 
---
Hey there - I'm sorry for just getting back to this (I've been off of reddit for the better part of a month). I can answer this concretely as the person who ran the project.
---
1) This was done by a group of artists and writers known as the Guild Wars 2 Artist Collective, and we worked for free. Personally, I dropped around 2,200 hours in the last year.
---
2) The smallest run we could do is 500. While this is actually possible from the requests I've received via email, the price would also be higher than the original sticker price (due to run counts), and there wouldn't be any way to work around customs costs/etc this time.
---
From those two reasons, it'd end up with me doing another 200-300 hours of work for free, and I unfortunately don't have that time to spare, or the space to commit to it again (since I'd pay for some of that out of pocket).
---
If you're interested in obtaining one, we'll be releasing the last (ever) sets mid-February once the hold is gone for remaining sets. 
---
Let me know if you have any further inquires I can answer. Thanks ~
---
Yes there are 3 level 80s. Me the old timey veteran that gets confused when things have changed in the past 5 years (I ran in circles in a spot in plains of ashford where I tamed my first hyena for 10 mins only to look it up and see they moved them somewhere else).
---
The guy who used a level 80 booster to get his level 80s and only knows that "mesmer is pretty i like mesmer"
---
And the one guy who knows his shit who gets exasperated by our nonsense. I'm quite poor since I didn't have much gold whenever I stopped playing and I realized my thief character didnt have level 80 gear in my backpack slot. I spent all 11 gold I owned on the "lucky monkey backpack" cuz I liked it, instead of 1 gold on the skinless ones that still had the stats. "STOP SPENDING GOLD ON MONKEY BUSINESS NOW YOU CAN'T AFFORD GEAR FOR YOUR OTHER CHARACTERS" was shouted very loudly and has become a catchphrase among the newbs who were there. 
---
The twin bartender rp?
---
If you want another mostly clueless level 80 to tag along, this sounds extremely fun and I’d love to be a part of it
---
&gt; Maybe because it's the very first "meaningful" death in the whole story.
---
Depends on your story choices, I suppose. Quinn was perhaps the first meaningful death to me, since I allowed it to happen, even if it happens off-screen. There's also Pol, Tiachren, and Vallus who could die to your action, and I felt more involved with the latter two than any death in Orr (besides the two I mentioned). Probably because my choice forced me to kill them personally.
---
And honestly, how many ghosts do we meet of those who died? Just Eir, and that was more for Braham than players. We never go to the Mists to meet old friends, and while there are "memories of them", that's not quite the same (thinking Mordremoth's battle specifically) since it's not actually them. It's more a reminder of the Commander's failure than a "temporary reunion" (of which we have yet to really have with anyone who died - again, there's Eir, but do we really reunite with her? Braham does, but not the Commander).
---
1. Warrior [https://www.google.com/search?q=metabattle&amp;cad=h](https://www.google.com/search?q=metabattle&amp;cad=h) Builds change with the seasonal updates.
---
2. Yes
---
3. No
---
4. Watch Youtube videos on PvP guides and practice dueling with people.
---
Deepstone has nothing to do with Dhuum or the Underworld. The Voice is just a nightmare demon, not related to Dhuum.
---
Next patch: Increased power scaling of Elementalist downed skill 3 to 5.50 from 2.25, as it didn't feel impactful enough.
---
If one argues that it must be a descendant of an Elder Dragon, then we were fucked from the get go, as we only ever had one and we need a bare minimum of four if we're to kill all six evil Elder Dragons.
---
You got the point here, tbh I WANT to play support chrono but I've skipped straight to trying to get leggy armor for mine because gearing her in ascended just seems like a waste
---
i actually used it a few days before the episode to finally finish the aurene doll collection thing to get the mini.
---
Herald power in Diviner can be interesting. You could provide too 10 players Might, Fury, Protection, Swiftness, good CC, descent Dps.
---
I play it in Fractal/Raid and it make run smoother. The Boon application  is mobile and constant. Its really Cool and the lifesteal from Shiro really help keeping alive and the CC Staff 5 is amazing. The Dps isn't that bad, Im not top Dps but Im close to average Dpser.
---
It actually makes me chuckle. Lol. Maybe next Wintersday, I'll be like this xd
---
&gt;Fixed a bug in which the Hammer's Hoard point of interest could not be activated from outside of the gate.
---
EXCELLENT change, but there's still the Consul's Tomb POI in the same area that has the exact same problem :/
---
It's still gameplay affecting content, as opposed to cosmetics. Tbh I feel the same way about HoT stat sets still, getting Viper's sets is still a pain
---
My favorite was "I don't even *remember you.* That makes this easy."
---
She already woke up at the end of Knight of the Thorn. She's been recovering since the beginning of Season 3, per Caithe, but was fully conscious once we restored Caladbolg.
---
And yes, her instantly becoming an Elder Jungle Dragon would be bad, but her being well into the process by the very next episode, far enough for us to kill Kralkatorrik without a replacement waiting, imo wouldn't be, if we spent most of the episode completing that then killing the heavily wounded Kralkatorrik.
---
This is how i feel about last night. Lol
---
I generally don't mind hopping in to help, but f'k if Executioner doesn't need more rewards for its HP Sponginess. 
---
It's impossible to know for Kuunavang or Albax, since Cantha.
---
Honestly, Shiny should be. Saltspray dragons live for centuries, and it was a hatchling in Nightfall. But it has been MIA (but so has a lot of things that suddenly turn up).
---
I normally run staff and fire/air/arcane in full berserker gear and heal glyph, glyph of storms, lightning hammer, primordal stance and fiery greatsword. For some of the harder events might swap out air for arcane for the vigor on crits and arcane shield traits and primordal stance for glyph of elemental power trait for a stunbreak. Kind of got a little used to using fire staff 4 and fiery greatsword 3 as extra dodges but end up going flying off ledges sometimes. For staff skills water 4, air 5 and earth 4 and lightning hammer 5  can be pretty useful for kiting and glyph of storms in earth for the blind. Then if all else fails downstate lava font for moar dakka.
---
&gt; if he sees a vision where he triumphs over the good guys, would he question whether the vision was false or not (again, assuming that Aurene is not really dead).
---
GuildWars2: Endgame?
---
^ couldn't have said better myself
---
That sounds more like a single episode, rather than a full season.
---
Also, Balthazar was no longer a god. Just to clarify.
---
Just entering the Mists won't instantly heal him. He'd have to recover, just like he was before we lured him in, after he got injured by Glint's ghost army in the Mists.
---
Taking a shit is a biological function, playing a video game is a leisure activity that is meant to be mentally stimulating. 
---
Wait, what? How do you deal with I/O delay?
---
I leveled my ranger from 53 to 80 exclusively by exploring high level zones.
---
I've always been a proponent of getting a decent amount of map completion done before max level, but it was my 8th character and I needed something to spice things up. So with that goal in mind, I set some rules for myself:
---
* Spend as much time as possible in areas where enemies have red names
---
* Minimize participation in events
---
* XP from hearts is acceptable, if they can be done
---
* Getting to places by letting other players clear the way is acceptable, but
---
   * Ask for help as little as possible and
---
   * No following zergs
---
This suddenly turned every open world map into a Metal Gear sneaking level. I had to study enemy patrols (with [increased aggro radius](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Character#Exploring_high_level_areas)), and plan my use of [Signet of Stone](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Signet_of_Stone) and pet sacrifice to get past mobs. Mind that you can't use mounts until level 80, even if they are unlocked.
---
I got every waypoint unlocked on every HoT and PoF non-LS map before 80. The hardest maps were Southsun Cove (every karka is a sniper) and Tangled Depths. Dragon Stand was surprisingly easy.
---
from the ones that crafted the ascended version, does it come with Infusion Slots?   
---
I just did the Heroic Dragonsblood Hammer, but it doesn't have them T.T
---
Report them for griefing then, or kick them -- no pug is going to jeopardize their chances of success in a fractal just for 10 seconds of lulz. If that were the case flux bomb trolling would be a thing. 
---
Wait.. This is actually real? :D.......:D....:D:D:D:D8=================D
---
&gt; Hm no,the small amount of magic dispersed from Primordus and Jormag s attacks did not cause Ley Crazed creatures,and the drain from Ommadd s machine was perfectly safe.
---
Where is your proof for any of that? The world's magic worsened after the events of Season 3, what else would cause that?
---
&gt; Also,Gods and Dragons do line up
---
No. They don't. People have tried, tried, tried for years. It got to the point where [ArenaNet made an in-game reference](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragons_and_Gods) to the fact people try but never manage it. It got to the point where an ArenaNet developer denied any connection.
---
People try, but it does not line up. Sorry, it's been fully, 100% debunked.
---
There are *some* similarities, but the similarities stop halfway always.
---
&gt; Balthazar is fire as well,just like Dwayna is Air,Melandru is Earth and Grenth is Cold.
---
Yes. But Dhuum was never ice. Kormir is not water despite the fact Abaddon is. This shows that secondary domains are mobile, can move from god to god based on their preference, and is not tied to their actual power, unlike the Elder Dragons' two spheres of influence.
---
&gt; Nothing says Balthazar cannot replace an ED except the fact that the PC fears he will destroy the world with his powers.
---
If Balthazar could be a replacement in The All, there would be no reason to stop him. The PC didn't just fear Balthazar would destroy the world, the PC knew Balthazar's actions would even without Balthazar intending it. And Balthazar knew it too. The Six Gods knew it too, that's why they left the world:
---
&gt; Kormir: We, the gods, saw there could be no victory in our inevitable conflict with the Elder Dragons.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Kormir: Waging war with them could only lead to the destruction of Tyria—and we, the Six, would be the match that would start the blaze.
---
&gt; [...]
---
&gt; Kormir: Whether he won or lost—by his death or theirs—Balthazar's ambitions would bring about the end of Tyria.
---
(Note: By Kormir's statement of "his death" leading to Tyria's end is in reference to when he was a god, where a singular god's death would be enough to destroy the world as we saw in Nightfall).
---
&gt; Balthazar was already being opposed by the Pact at that point,of course he would be against them. He got caged for wanting to help mankind,and then when he s free we go and oppose him. He s rightly pissed.
---
The Pact never, at any point, opposed Balthazar. Elonians did after he began massacring them left and right to add to his army; the Vigil never opposed Balthazar directly in Flashpoint, they just fought his mercenaries and escorted the Commander to the island. Balthazar still tried to convince the Commander to join him during Path of Fire, after the massacring of hundreds.
---
Balthazar didn't get caged for wanting to help mankind. If you actually played Path of Fire and listened to Kormir, you'd know he never cared about mankind. A dev even confirmed, the reason why Balthazar initially wanted to fight the Elder Dragons was **because he was bored.** To quote:
---
Balth the god of war had been more or less idle since the Exodus, with very little in the way of human contact or terrestrial combat. He's a fiery god of action and he was champing at the bit for the chance to do what he was born to do (as he sees it).
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/74qjlh/path_of_fire_devs_here_ask_us_anything/do0exa5/?context=3
---
He didn't care about Tyrians. He didn't care about Tyria. All he wanted was to fight.
---
&gt; Also no,neither of those 3 was as close to humans as Balthazar was,even by in-game scriptures,
---
Dwayna outright stopping a war is not as close as Balthazar when he fueled a war? Abaddon stepping in to wipe out non-humans when asked for aide, then empowering a bunch of humans, is not as close as Balthazar? Lyssa living among humans was not as close to humans as Balthazar who only appeared when they called on him during a losing battle?
---
You're more than just a bit biased here.
---
Actually the Pale Tree would qualify as a replacement since it is also descended from an Elder Dragon, as you pointed out. Glint was a dragon champion, just like the Pale Tree.
---
Also, another thing that people have forgotten is that the Forgotten purified Glint. It's entirely possible that her plan would've involved us purifying more dragon champions and rehabilitating them. 
---
As for being fucked, it's possible that this is all part of Glint's plan and that she foresaw that we needed to make these sacrifices to win, similar to what Dr. Strange did in Infinity War.
---
As stated in other posts and comments, the more we involve with Kralkatorrik, more we get closer with Dr. Strange type of situations. Like fractals, time loops, time locks, seeing alternative futures, maybe another case of "that was the only way"... But I believe Anet will consider a unique path for the demise of this dragon.
---
Would we call it The Krak?  
---
Hard to imagine big scaly claws snapping.  A bit too much anthropomorphizing there. 
---
" We're fighting an intelligent force of nature. One that potentially knows all of our plans before we've even started making them. "
---
Implying that the commander is of the plan-making sort.
---
Excuse me, taking a shit is leisurely activity.
---
In addition to trouble with pre-boon stacking, like you mentioned, we had had two instances of a player falling off the map because of slippery. 
---
It’s just plain silly. I would understand if more if stability helped, but it doesn’t. What’s the point of longer stab if you are slip-sliding uncontrollably off the map?
---
She went from a sultry detective who wears an ascot tie like Fred from Scooby Doo. She loved money almost more than anything else in the world, second only to her lover. Oh, and she received a sword with her dead sister in it, baddass!
---
Now she's a flanderized lesbian minority who pulls out of the story for 2 years because of a little injury, all while having angsty arguments with kasmeer. wtf
---
He has one of his branded do it for him. If you invest the time to get that many minions, might as well make them do something.
---
So that's why the new map runs so poorly.
---
So reading up on this (sorry, it's been a long time), you actually need to *complete* the first mission to start training masteries for gliding/mounts. So you will be able to explore the maps but you will quickly run into areas you will be unable to reach and your progress will stop.
---
Bonding with Caithe: In one of the last scenes the crystals on Caithe's body became smaller as far as I noticed. I'm waiting for a moment when Caithe's crystals start glowing bigger and brighter and we know Aurene is back - somehow, somewhere.
---
Technically speaking, Glint was more than a dragon champion; she was literally Kralkatorrik's daughter. The Pale Tree is a dragon champion, but not literally a child of Mordremoth. If anything were children of Mordremoth, it'd be the Spitfires that look like smaller Mouths of Mordremoth (the Mouth being Mordremoth's actual body, despite its name).
---
Hence my statement that "replacement must be biologically descended from an Elder Dragon" means we're screwed, since Aurene was the last such being we knew about.
---
That said, it's unlikely Tequatl was a literal child of Zhaitan, and Tequatl was confirmed to be becoming a new Elder Death Dragon during Season 1 before we killed it.
---
For the record, I do think the Pale Tree is a viable and intended candidate for Mordremoth's replacement, and that we'll find that she's on her way to becoming such when we next meet her - baring that, we'll find out in Season 5 that Malyck's Tree is replacing Mordremoth, as that tree likely wasn't knocked into an on-and-off coma for three plus years.
---
Unless you have a static that runs FB/Ren, just make a chrono.
---
It's not hard to play, and it's still incredibly useful.
---
I wouldn't really recommend heal tempest anymore. In any situation where you would consider bringing it, heal Scourge is an equivalent or better option. Heal Tempest is also really boring to play.
---
There is still a lot of uncertainty about Chrono gear right now. Good chronos in coordinated groups need minimal amounts of boon duration now (I run about 50%), but in PUGs and less experienced groups you want to have quite a bit more. I recommend going to 80% or so.
---
For open world.. I run Tempest. It's a lot more self sufficient than Weaver. Just run Staff and kite around, dodging as needed.  Even just camping fire is more than enough for open world, though fresh air helps keep things bursty
---
To follow that thread, it would work much like how you take out Mordy.
---
Mordy was too reliant on his mind powers.  We attacked him via an outlet there to end him.  
---
Kralk fights, knowing he can predict the actions.  Without that, he has to go on instinct, which he has none of.  You beat him because despite all his power, he no longer has any clue what to do, and thus just doesn't do anything (or leaves himself open to simple failures, etc).    
---
It's actually an old fantasy trope.  First time I remember reading it was the fight of Bink vs X(A/N)th in the Xanth book *The Source of Magic*.  The character discovered in a previous book that he was immune to magic, in a world filled with it.  It made him essentially Superman.  At one point, he has this immunity removed (actually reversed) and only survives because he spent his whole life training to have nothing.  
---
I don't agree with the negatives you present, to be honest.
---
Mostly because her *flanderizing* was part from her from the start and the whole thing actually adding to her character, instead of deminishing it. The good old lower class, upper class dynamic, etc.
---
She went out of the story because of loss. She needed time and that's understandable, because grief is a thing.
---
What's not really fitting is mostly that she doesn't really show her *leader* side, or her *cool head* as much anymore. The writing o her turned also pretty *lackluster* as she is barely using her *priory* or *detective* knowledge anymore. Most of her stuff has been delegated to Taimi.

1 - Depends on what you want to do.  I recommend a team fighting approach.  The best team fighters are tough and have good aoes.   So I'd recommend Necromancer or Engineer.   Necromancer is not too difficult to play and wins team fights.  Engineer is slightly harder to play but is more versatile as well.
---
2 - Yes, definitely.   
---
3 - No, just make sure you have armor in every slot and the right weapons.  You can buy lvl 1 versions in the pvp zone for nothing.
---
4 - PvP is generally about taking and holding 2 points.   If you're not a great duelist, don't be the guy who tries to take home.  Don't be the guy who tries to run to their home.    Go into mid with the pack, kill people and stomp the yard.
---
Alright, I think I'll just do the first mission of HoT then and try to get hero points for chrono, hold off on doing more story past that until I have season 2. Thanks for the help :)
---
I gotta disagree with your examples of other prophetic beings. They have either been something a simple scout could have reported, or not come to pass. Glint and Aurene, and probably Kralkatorrik assuming we're killing him soon, are the only ones who have definitely shared positively prophetic visions of the future that definitely originated from a place of future sight.
---
The gods granting visions to their followers doesn't mean they are prophetic. Especially not when the vision pertains to an event that is currently happening, just far away. The Pale Tree displayed *a* future, but nothing indicates it was prophetic in any way, especially considering literally none of the events shows came to pass.

Overclocked 8086k is better for GW2 than overclocked 9900k.
---
Fite me.
---
That's not information that is available through the wiki, api or the mumble api, so that would require reading data from the game client which is prohibited
---
Congratulations. What do you want us to do about it?
---
Didnt the forgotten also tried to cleanse Kralk? So did he got his powers from him?
---
I’d break out my pitchfork but I can’t forge it!!!
---
They can use a single room /small part of the map of any former episode in an upcoming episode before moving on to the new map, if they want to continue with the business model of locking maps behind gems.
---
Commander! I've found a way to absorb dragon magic... but you won't like it. Come meet me at the forge, quickly!
---
Everyone please make sure to report any posts you see that have spoilers visible in the title or body/image. 
---
Try these:
---
- Environment: low. cuz it renders a lot of ambient objects you don't need
---
- shadow: low/medium. Since i saw you tick ambient occlusion and it's quite resource costly. So putting on shadow may help with the change. Plus shadow in this game isn't that resource hogging.
---
- character model limit: lowest. Aka even less players rendered on your screen. the rest will just appear name tags if you have players name tag toggled on.
---
  -  ambient occlusion: off
---
  - best texture filtering: off
---
  - technically the rest of the tickboxes are off except LOD
---
No worries. Just as an fyi, there are often hero point trains run on the HoT maps with squads completing them in quick succession. Many of the hero points are champion level events or locked behind advanced masteries, so running with a HP train with people helping out will make unlocking chrono really quick
---
Looks great on my FB, play around with other armor slots, something else is fucking up the attachment points

Either.

New player question about mounts:
---
I have just started the game but I have both HoT and PoF expansions. I was wondering what the fastest way to get a mount on all my characters is? From reading the wiki it seems to me that the fastest way is to use one of my free Level 80 Boosts on a character, and complete a quest in PoF.
---
My hesitation is that I'm so new to the game that I don't want to use a level 80 boost this early, because I want to experience leveling up the regular way. I guess I can just use it on a character and not play it anytime soon, but I wouldn't know what profession to boost to 80, etc. But I really do want a mount on my new characters ASAP to cut travel time. Any suggestions?
---
Alternatively, any other fast ways to get a mount on a fresh account?
---
Well... they could show some cute cats?...
---
Oh, and show that the next legendary weapon will be a third staff, only to fck up everyone who waits for the greatsword.
---
I do like the idea that he has domain over time, and I like the idea of trapping him in a fractal. (that also gives us a new fractal)
---
But I'm gonna chalk this one up to inconsistent writing. I have a really hard time believing that back when HoT was released, or before, the writers had a plan for Kralk and Aurene and future sight. 
---
maybe I give him some catnip first :)) 
---
Interesting use of the Escapism song.
---
While something like that may be interesting to explore and can't be ruled out directly, &gt;!Mordremoth was a special case because his magic was specifically attuned to minds (as the mind/life/plant dragon). If aurene also absorbed that ability from Mordrmoth, it *may* be possible&lt;!
---
Well, since we will celebrate Lunar Newyear and maybe SAB, before we do our next step... ;)
---
Me, every time I fight the Shatterer.
---
anyway. I really like your art style. I hope you will show us more :) 
---
i like to use this version of reddit when i don't want to get spoiled:
---
https://qq.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/
---
its basically the same subreddit but it filters out all posts with spoiler tags
---
I’m confused. If you don’t intend to finish the ascended weapon, why start the collection for it in the first place?
---
She was supposed to die in the final confrontation with Scarlet but it got leaked, people complained and they changed the script. Ever since anet has no idea what to do with her or Kas. 
---
I tried all different combinations, only changing the pants to something different fixes it. 
---
yeah I was thinking about Jormag and Primordius that's why I made the comment. wish we could fight them too and discover each of their special magic. &gt;.&lt;
---
Beautiful &lt;3
---
Considering he doesn't exist? No.
---
Oh right, 5 from the grand chest in the hoard right?
---
But... it is fun.. it is something else. Sadly it doesn’t change the fights a single bit
---
&gt;wah wah, gibs me dat easy gold
---
yeah 2+ days is typical. 
---
You and your fat invisible hips ...
---
I know it's so freaking great. It really irks me that Siren's Landing is described as a filler episode when it's a really great epilogue to Personal Story just like Knight of Thorn is to HoT.
---
yep, the snow on wintersday events is also terrible. I think snow is only a overlay while the other is real particles with/in depth 
---
Fair point, mounts were not always around. I just meant I wanted to run around, do hearts missions and events, and explore faster.
---
I prefer to save my boosts for now, so I will ask if someone can run me through. Thanks for the offer. If I am on when you are, my character's name is Neemu, or Ashe Snowfire.
---
Is it from Knight of the Thorn?
---
Seriously. Braham and Rox are almost family and she know found fellow charr that make her feel like she belongs. Her soft nature finally has a place in the world since Acalonian charr are rough assholes.
---
I am also interested! Looking forward to playing with you all
---
Welcome to GW2

I got 3 from the light of deldrimor chest in the treasure room.

Slippery Slope still isnt deleted

unless they've changed it recently, I don't believe that it's a hard requirement.

are you on NA? I can help you get that right now if you'd like

[This Firebrand build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cM7W0KbFWI) is my go-to OP open world build when I wanna solo group events and stuff. It's not quite as OP as it used to be (sigil of concentration and tome CD nerfs hurt it a lot) but it's still one of the most OP open world builds I've played. (replace the sigil of concentration with sigil of bounty and make sure you keep those stacks up)
---
I quit playing fractals because they got so fucking repetitive and easy. Just becasue you have to figure out the optimal strategy again doesn't mean mixing things up once in a while is a bad design decision. Try playing for fun instead of gold for once.
---
Yes, if you get a plate, you have a 50% chance of getting this POI without having to do the story.
---
Is power zerker not a thing anymore? Trying to find what a current build would look like but can't find anything.
---
And legendary gear has a huge quality of life advantage over ascended gear that it ahouldnt have. Give free stat swap and sigil/rune swap to ascended gear and it would reduce the grind. 
---
You're doing it wrong. You only need to do each meta once each day, then do the puzzle and use the Light of Deldremor extra button to fidn the hidden chests in the plate rooms. That's where you get your dailys Jewels. 
---
There are also two hidden chests in the Gauntlet that leads to the Mastery point, and they're near the beginning (unless the location's randomized, I've only gone to get them once).
---
I understand what you're saying, but in context of my advice for a new player that won't understand the nuance involved in predicting an enemy player's movements and whether they will try to move to a point to contest it or not, it's not a super-helpful distinction to make for someone trying to understand the mechanics of the conquest mode with no real experience with which to contextualize your advice. People generally say "don't fight off point" because most of the action impacting the absolute immediate influences for winning (de-capping enemy points, capping free points, team fights on contested nodes, rotating, holding) are focused near, on, or around points or the movement to them. Sure, you're absolutely correct, if you can kill someone off point, near the point, or someone otherwise that you know is coming to contest you, definitely don't hesitate. However, in context of learning mechanics for the first time, it's more important for a new player to understand how nodes centralize the movement of a PvP match. If, for example, you don't have any contextualized experience for your advice, someone may chase a Daredevil or a tanky Weaver, Mesmer, or Warrior in a match up that is fundamentally advantageous to the enemy player's class.   
---
So, in this sense, my advice is directed at a player with a rudimentary understanding. And telling a new player how nodes centralize play is more useful than telling them that they should, with no experience to contextualize, seek to fight away from pivotal map objectives, potentially their teammates, and also potentially ignore the intricacies of how strategic momentum, snowballing, or rotting can influence a victory. I agree, of course, in some situations, you're not going to stick like glue to a point if your spec or class relies on kiting against a less-than desirable match up, but I meant quite plainly to fight on point to contest captures rather than, for example, a new ranger player trying to longbow a Firebrand on mid node from a distance while the Firebrand is uncontested capping -- this is the context in which you generally fight on point to delay capture of a contested node, which is absolutely and fundamentally important for a new player to understand.
---
For a while after mounts where introduced, the engage skill wasn't scaled properly, and you could just one shot everything in the low level maps with them.
---
Now, it's a lot less disruptive, and will certainly speed things up. Certainly can't blame you for wanting that.
---
And agony is just artificial difficulty and a way to gear gate fractals. Fractals can give you ascended weapon and armor boxes, but you need ascended gear in the first place 
---
No you're rather wrong on that front bud. Bottlenecking exists. Older engines, and older MMO engines in particular are very, very single core CPU intensive and don't utilise more than 2 cores in most cases. Usually the widely accepted best everyday CPU for GW2 is the 7700K, that thing is a single core overclock beast. Bottom line though, if something is getting bottlenecked by the CPU (and the GW2 engine very much is because it's shite), your GPU really doesn't come into play very much. Don't matter if you're running a 1080ti, which in my case, I do, it'll still run like shite in populated areas.
---
To me, the bigger deal was the dramatic hue shift. 
---
Or we gonna kill them and eat them. That's a secret technique passed on us by Aurene.
---
i believe i crafted about 12k mithril ingots for Pharus yesterday
---
I'm mostly just running around doing the new thunderhead stuff.
---
Well, looks like we might have a Steven Universe fan at ArenaNet.
---
You're making a lot of false assumptions about my post and attitude. My post was simply to inform others on the performance of the game paired with an i9-9900k cpu. You simply chose to perceive it negatively.
---
And how the head was cut off. 
---
Eh, is she though? Reading what she wrote actually explains a lot of things about the things Anet's story lacks. In specific:
---
&gt;*But if they stick with what we'd outlined for next season, it's going to be a doozy, and not the sort of storyline that games like this normally attempt. I wasn't sure how to do it well (I tend to be like, I dunno, we'll make it work), so I'm really curious to see HOW they do it.* 
---
This means pretty much that they write the entire story with only the ending in mind, and not the entire journey. And this shows on every single release they've made. Most of the times, the final mission and ending of each story is amazing, the same with this episode where the entire last mission and ending were the most well-written parts of the story, but the entire rest was rushed and sloppy, almost lazily written. 
---
If they only put as much care in the writing of every mission instead of just making sure the last one feels good, then GW2's story could easily be the best in the MMO genre, but so far they just don't do that, and it's a damn shame because there's potential. 
---
I for one am very interested to see how they will do things from now on that Jessica is no longer with them. Hopefully they change writing mindset as well. The journey should be interesting throughout, not just the ending.
---
To counter this, I will now endeavor to use this phrase in the title when something hilarious happens in the story so precedent is set and no one can tell.
---
Considering that the single core performance of the i9-9900k is better than the 8086k and the 9900k can also oc higher, I don't see how you came to that assumption.
---
Do.. you know how gen 2 legendaries are made?
---
Taco doesn't show anything *through* the game client, only over (it's an overlay).
---
Taco also doesn't have any image recognition, and only uses the apis ArenaNet have made available to developers.
---
Taco could render on top of any app, not just GuildWars2, if the developer chose to do so. It could easily render on top of Microsoft Word. For convenience the developer chose to hide the overlay for all other apps though.
---
Discord uses the same mechanism to show which people is talking on top of the game.
---
Trapping Kralk in a time loop is a surefire way to ensure someone has to come and shout him to death as he goes into the mists to devour souls sometime in the future.
---
Amazing.
---
Pretty much.
---
Might I ask how? What is your initial investment, what is the amount of spread and what's the volume of the items you're trying to flip?
---
Its fkn fun! And that's all that matters. Would be nice to have world wide collision.
---
New physix in the engine, always welcome!
---
Pretty much. Str/Disc/Bers (top line) with power and precision signets, throw bolas, and headbutt. Greatsword/Axe+Axe.
---
To be fair, the Commander is really going to have a lot of aches and pains when he gets older. I can see it now, sitting in a pub in Divinity's Reach, grey and shriveled, boring everyone to death with stories of how he beat up dragons and gods and Skritt. 
---
Maybe, but yours plate don't change if you enter the room. So it is probably bug with that Purple Room, and for now you can logout and login to try to get the plate faster, till they not fix it. That is all, what I wanned to say and now we doing dicussion on bug I dont know for what reason.
---
I find the new SA 100 times more enjoyable as the old one. I didn't have any problem with it in CM's and T4 and it was fun to play around it.
---
week or more
---
I read that as later on we find out shes been kinda endlessly running from kralk trying to kill her so shes dead ass tired. She cant hide anywhere shenknows of yet, shes 2 years old suffering under a legacy she never had a choice in and shes been running from so many things.
---
My only beef is with slippery slope, new SA is pretty damn fun
---
no i mean if using X spears in some sort of constraint was an ahci, as it is not who cares, just afk while others do it /s
---
DH wasn't even a significant offender, but you are right about the timing. Elite specializations being designed without considering PvP is what really killed the game mode. Every skill doesn't need to have 3 different effects and apply 3 boons. It's just made the game so spammy.
---
This brought me to tears... again. And then watching the clips of streamers seeing her body that they just showed on Guild Chat made me cry AGAIN! I'm dehydrating.
---
Lol you don't know how companies work do you? 
---
Salvage what? She was it. There is no salavging without her.
---
Would you want another BS ex-machina to show up to deal with the fallout of defeating the dragons. That would be far more lame than a lore justified resurrection. 
---
There's nothing wrong with aurene coming back via Joko's magic and whatever Glint told her about Ascension. It doesn't lessen the fact that she died. She had to. Just as she has to come back and replace Kralkatorrik.
---
lol you got me buddy, i have no fucking idea. how?
---
Who pays for the salaries of support personel? Oh yeah... Maybe smarten up. Lol
---
Yup. Agreed. Too many players are far too disenfranchised with the gamemode to ever allow it recover, I include myself in that.
---
I actually quite like the SA change because it introduces a new, interesting game mechanic whereas it seems like other new instabs like Sugar Rush and Outflanked just makes shit hit harder which just makes pugging more annoying.
---
If Abaddon can still take Kralkatorrik's power then... Balthazar can too.
---
Of course, we also have Dhuum, who used to be the God of Death, and that guy has died like three times now.
---
Maybe aurene splashed all her dragon blood on him 
---
You should get 3 from that chest. There's a small chance to get them from the other chests around the place though
---
I think it would be fine since the forge is in a friendly, peaceful area that you can waypoint to easily.
---
Sorry, there seems to still be some misunderstanding here. What do you *think* I am implying to warrant this rebuttal? TacO does not employ image recognition *right now* but it *could* do so in the future and I see nothing in these guidelines prohibiting that besides the overly vague bullshit.
---
yup EU
---
It's a "free" in-game armour skin, not a gemstore outfit; what do you expect?
---
Wrong attitude to have. If you want your game to be around in the future people need to pay for it. But ya know, it's cool, push people away from your game. 
---
Yes! Salvage things and sell the materials on the trading post. The salvage kits pay for themselves very quickly. 
---
Dan from accounting? Lower your ego when talking to us peasants Mr. Education 2019, sir. We of lower intellect can't even grasp the portion of massive knowledge your kind possesses. Please, be kind and don't shit all over us from your tower of self-righteousness right away, let me at least use my umbrella first.
---
Oh man I wish that Kralk would have  visited me last year before a statistics exam...
---
it's not bad and won't kill you most of the time, but it is very annoying indeed. i find myself hating other people more with this version of SA than the previous one....specially those idiots that instead of finding a clear spot to stand to attack the boss they push you out of the spot you have by force....AND SPECIALLY those idiots that haven't realized they are not using seaweed salad and for no reason just wiggle and push everyone around them instead of standing still like a person with common sense.
---
i was hoping the new SA just meant you couldnt walk through other people's hitbox, but being able to push other people just makes me hate very player and dev who thought it was a good idea
---
I approve this message
---
The Pale Tree wasn't the only tree to produce Sylvari.  The Sylvari personal story can introduce the character Malyck who was from a tree that didn't have a Dream of Dreams.  His tree was west of the Pale Tree.  The other humanoids that came from trees were Mordrem.  
---
Spoiler: The Pale Tree is a blighting tree.  Sylvari are just less obedient mordrem.
---
And dan from accounting also gets his salary from players. So yes, you obviously have no clue how this stuff works. 
---
... if people do the other 2 metas.
---
Somehow I feel like pulling that one off would take an even bigger contrivance than bringing Aurene back.  But it's an option.  I can see Taimi reverse-engineering an artificial dragon regulator, she certainly has the experience studying dragon magic.
---
I use arcane shield, ice bow and fire signet, i occasionally swap ice bow with glyph of storms but that's about it. 
---
It’s the [Candy Corn Gobbler](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Candy_Corn_Gobbler)
---
I guess it's too late to mention two things that are being overlooked here.   
---
\- It has been stated that tickets are worked as they get them. Like waiting in line.  
---
You aren't the only one trying to get back in.
---
\- There was just a new living world... Like times before... support times start to slow.   
---
I believe you can figure why.
---
AP and a sense of completion
---
Oh right, it’s that time of the year again when I temporarily unsubscribe from the sub to avoid spoilers on my front page. Thanks for reminding me. 
---
Which is exactly why any support company splits tickets between simple, password resets or simple account connection issues, and real support issues. Any company who has people locked out of accounts for more than a few hours is failing drastically.
---
There's just a lot of coincidences that feel too convenient to me.
---
Ronan is said to have stolen the Pale Tree's seed from a cavern in Maguuma that was guarded by aggressive 'plant creatures'. During the living story arc that takes us through Caithe's memories, we discover a cavern in Maguuma that had been sealed by the Forgotten. We end up having to bring some divine fire to get it open. It turns out to be the den of the dragon that attacked the Pale Tree.
---
It's also where Caithe's final memory seed blooms, and is where Wynne told Caithe that the sylvari come from Mordremoth.
---
In Dry Top, we encounter a tribe of centaur who, though they don't know of Ventari, also splintered from the Harathi centaurs a few hundred years ago and follow similar teachings to those he inscribed upon his tablet. One of their villages was situated directly outside this sealed cavern.
---
If you think back to when Aurene was a baby and we had to try and teach her right from wrong in the Tarir trials, I consider that analogous to what Ventari and Ronan did with the Pale Tree. I believe that the Forgotten cleansed her seed and freed her from Mordremoth's control, but being free doesn't automatically mean you're going to be benevolent.
---
You have to remember that Glint and the Pale Tree are essentially the same kind of creature. They're both direct descendants of Elder Dragons, and oracles.
---
Ventari and the wisdom of his tablet nurtured the Pale Tree. It's also hinted at during one of the 2012 lore interviews that yes, sylvari are humanoid because the Pale Tree was influenced by Ronan since she was planted upon his and his family's graves.
---
It's *very* vaguely hinted at that Malyck's tree, or what we've heard about it, is what the Pale Tree would have become if she were never influenced by Ventari, but that implies that Ronan actually had very little to do with the sylvari race's humanoid appearance.
---
She's more known for working on MapleStory at Nexon America, like in [this MapleStory Class Auditions video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF7VAqqY_WI).
---
As i understand, your decision was well-weighed and fairly indicated. And xen just gave proper farewell message. There was no need to point out the wrongfulness of user's attitude, this is just a basic etiquette over here, when someone leaves we tell them: goodbye, o/, or something similar.  
---
Hitting them squats. 
---
It's hard to tell just *what* he wants - I *think* those are supposed to be mostly English words, but there's not really any cohesive sentence structure to guide us to his meaning.
---
Look, I don't know what the inner working of ANET are. And I'm not gonna criticize something I have no place in criticizing. I stated my peace. You can either wait your turn like everyone else or not.   
---
SPOILER TAG BOI
---
See, I just wish they’d let us know whether or not they intend to restore instruments to their pre-August 26th state(when they were working), so I’m not just sitting around expecting a fix and can just quit playing gw2.
---
&gt; Commander: I saw the Master of Peace take an egg.
---
&gt; Ogden: The last one intact. It's been in stasis since her death. The Master of Peace is taking it where it will be safe and allowed to hatch.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hidden_Arcana
---
We don't know what happened to them, but they're no longer "intact" and, since Aurene is the *second* scion, they didn't hatch. So they're gone.
---
Thanks for the suggestions everyone! 
---
I did not realize it was about the entire world, silly me. Maybe i can find some will and strength to read through it in near future. In which case be sure ill be back with questions and inquires for further development.
---
I agree with ChmSteki. Don't run the earth traitline if you want protection. You're better off using arcane and attuning to earth. With a bit of the new diviner gear and the warhorn concentration trait you can maintain protection pretty easily by swapping to earth and wh4.
---
The open world needs more crafting stations in general.
---
It would also be cool if some recipes could only be crafted at specific crafting stations. Immersion and stuff like that, you know.
---
Man, that video is terrible. The build section isn't until 4:58 in to a 7:34 long video.
---
'Goin' for a walk in the countryside... Who's the Hobbit now, eh, Frodo?'
---
This is quite frankly hilarious.
---
Like we learn in fahrar:  
---
Asura are friends, *not food*.
---
are you serious?
---
&gt; It also allows players to push each other without another players consent
---
do you think i gave my consent to get 5 agony stacks when pugs kept chasing me around?(i doubt they did it on purpose, but still)
---
the scenario where you get pushed into something bad and can't recover is pretty rare..yea it's a frustrating instability but tbh it's one of the least annoying ones
---
so what do i think? i think it's about a hundred times better than the old one
---
I feel like this is supposed to be her portrait. It really captures her beauty, at the same time coldness and a tad loneliness. 
---
Collison detection should be trivial for an Asura.
---
The jewels seems fine to me, yes. But without laurels from daily (which, yes, I know happened long ago but god forbid you actually use your currency they haven’t added sinks for in 4 years) has me waiting until Sunday to make my first weapon. Yeah, I can wait, but not being able to actively work towards it feels like a bummer.
---
Firebrand with plaguedoctors gets 100% quickness uptime and almost all the damage as vipers... running diviners would be extremely silly 
---
okay now this is epic
---
My double click macro is way faster to drag across multiple stacks of whatever I want to spam than right click - consume all on each stack. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9d9ahp/tried_benchmarking_power_berserker_on_warrior_29k/
---
This seems to be somewhat up to date. It is definitely playable, but often worse than other alternatives. 
---
if you care about spoilers dont go on reddit
---
It's fine, people just love to bitch and moan cause they can't get what they want right away. There are far worse MMOs out there with FAR worse RNG objectives. 
---
is the Iron and Plat ore node farms marked?
---
Change your playstyle a bit and you should be fine.
---
I've changed from sword weaver to fa tempest and had no issues.
---
I remember people were not happy at all 5-6 years ago
---
so...
---
Nope but I can add them
---
you can solo all fractals also to make it easier you can multibox
---
Aetherblade solo with multibox- https://www.twitch.tv/videos/276224529
---
For fractals up to T2, you're still fine with staff. T3 has a large step up in difficulty which needs more attention to your build but staff will be fine for T1 and T2, likewise I sometimes run chaos in lower level fractals I like the way it works. 
---
If you feel like trying PvP, condi with staff is very strong because of the variety it brings. Mirage with staff as an opener weapon is powerful because it's confusing and staff 5 has a very long range. 
---
It's a jack of all trades weapon for mesmer. It does lots, but nothing is enormously strong. For everything but raids and T3/T4 fractals, it's absolutely fine.    
---
Well, we don't know what the internal politics are like on this one.  Maybe there's clear-cut design notes and documentation somewhere saying the POI is supposed to be activated at the door.  Maybe POIs have a base AOE and are scripted up to a larger AOE and something was off with the snip of code that sets the AOE of that POI.
---
Just sayin', maybe it actually *is* a bug fix.  Since (in my opinion) they fixed the wrong dang POI and left the one that requires story completion alone I'm inclined to think that's the case.
---
Day one in the first few hours of the patch, someone was all-caps shouting in chat OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE *SPOILER*. And they kept going on about it. Naturally everyone jumped on his ass but come on. Why isn't there a report option for spoilers? Make these jerks face a consequence for their mindlessness.
---
Firebrand with nothing but a Fractal pot can get 100% Quickness uptime, regardless of stats. The extra buffer is just helpful when in Fractals.
---
And Power is better in Fractals in general since if you've got fights with short phases, power spikes hard early and trails off, whereas condi starts weaker and ramps up. Additionally, Power FB uses Perfect Inscriptions and shares Bane Signet for 216 power to the rest of your team, which is a pretty significant damage amp after a bar break.
---
But like I said, 5 man content. Power FB doesn't hold up in Raids, where condi Quickbrand outpaces it over time. But even that build doesn't use Plaguedoctor stats, it runs Viper.
---
 Chrono nothing. I want to use the stats on Firebrand, Renegade, and Druid.
---
That's exactly what I was thinking when I saw it in my home instance.
---
I dont know but i love seeing mesmer die.
---
But better then the true death? ..... although I mean she might be in the mists right?
---
I did in fact buy a bunch for POIs, because I'm not putting 14 alts through story.  This update doesn't fix *that* problem, though, as storyless access to the other POI depends entirely on the the catacombs puzzle (which *ends* at the hoard POI) routing through it.
---
Imagine being this fucking shallow.
---
What is the current raid and fractal build for Chronomancer?  What is chrono main role in each?
---
How is an external (albeit officially provided) API *more* acceptable than what the game itself puts right in front of your face? I never claimed TacO did any of those, but in my opinion reading character-specific API data is more intrusive on the technical side than observing the screen. I certainly consider TacO in its actual present state more invasive **and** more "advantageous" than the old chatlog-reading dps meters.
---
Also technically TacO *does* access the "non-public" information of which account/character *any one specific user* is playing during its runtime. At least that kind of stuff *should* be non-public.
---
Prices will plummet as supply increases.  C'est la vie!
---
As it stands, if you're doing the metas they're a nice bit of additional daily income, and probably will be for a bit.
---
&gt; That's literally what a prophetic vision is. A display of a possible future.
---
No, it's not. It would be if it was accurate, but it wasn't. Only Aurene and Glint have shown themselves to be prophetic by accurately foretelling the future.
---
And regardless of that, that's a semantic argument with no bearing at my actual point. The fact remains that Glint and Aurene are the only ones who have accurately foretold the future, making the skill unique to them.
---
&gt;so either Dwayna knew what kind of magic the charr were hoping to enact
---
She's literally a goddess. There's no way she *wouldn't* be able to immediately notice the incredibly powerful magic artifacts they were suddenly in possession of.
---
&gt;with the fortune teller and Shiro's future
---
She didn't foretell shit. All she predicted was that the Emperor would have him killed during the harvest ceremony. She didn't predict that he would enter the temple. It's not a prophetic vision when 1. it's not a vision, and 2. it's a setup. I'm not prophetic for pointing a gun at your head and saying "you will die soon. beware the man with a gun", and then pulling the trigger.
---
I don't care how long it takes to get the plates, I care that Anet loves to implement *schedule* gates. They don't release content that takes "six hours to complete". They release content that takes "20 minutes to complete, that you can only do once per day, and you need to do it 18 times".
---
Just gonna necro this comment real quick.
---
I feel like these new bosses are too boring, while they can be very fun, the attacks hit hard without much indication, and with stupid aoe circle indications(spider and elemental), cc phases are quite unimportant between phases, actual adds/puzzle phases are kinda boring (hello derpstone), unimportant adds and aoe spam everywhere(hello cancer oasis), weird attack pattern, bosses without needing special tools like reflect or stab (cough cough the voice), weird special action with no benefit aside from spamming it on cd (I'm looking at you again derpstone). I just don't feel like these bosses are meant to be challenging and fun as much as it was meant to be a pain in the ass to clear every day. Every time my group sees derpstone/cancer oasis/siren's we kinda just sigh and say something like "oh look it's cancer oasis today, let's just get it over with". But if it is something like 99 or 100, you see many groups doing the CM with no ess requirements (in NA at least, I know we are casual plebs plz no hate). 
---
Way to make me cry. Thanks. Good video tho. 👍
---
I don’t understand why people don’t do this. If you don’t want to be spoiled, avoid the internet until you do whatever it is you need to do (watch a new episode, play a new expansion, whatever). A couple of hours without reddit won’t kill you
---
That's really pulling straws. Do yourself a favour and avoid the internet.  Can't expect nobody to talk about the hot new content because you can't stay away from social media 
---
Still get downed by pocket raptors
---
Many Thanks for all the work that you do on the markers.  they really help me a lot.
---
I like not having to deal with the dmg aspect (only an issue when playing with idiots) of the old SA even if it was a minor thing to play around. The new SA i really dislike for losing control of my character. To me that make the new SA and slipper slope the worst instabilities in the game hands down. 
---
thanks, nobody cares
---
Well
---
I care tho
---
oh yeah i agree for sure. but I'm sure theres a lvl 13 out there without a high level pal to help. If they get to the point of frustration then there is another way. Just highlighting that other way.
---
Ohhhh, now I get it. My brain's running on coffeine, just waiting for the r / woosh comments 
---
You don't need it so just make it super frustrating for everyone to get LUL. Make up for the lack of content by time gating everything so you have to grind for 1 hr each day instead of grinding it all at once LUL content amirite?
---
check his username
---
tupac cares, if don't nobody else cares :D
---
(but i see what you did there :D)
---
I really love stuff like this. It feels so natural how you progress from wanting to cut down a tree to fighting one boss after another, and how it’s perfectly normal for a bunch of strangers to join you in the middle to help out. 
---
wtf does that even mean?
---
Not really found of questionnaires, but i would really like to see a discussion like this in the sub.
---
Mental health in relation to gaming, well-being are really interesting subjects. You see people invested in farming, worried about meaningless stuff, or annoyed about not being able to reach some virtual goals, and doing same things over and over; around here. Would really what to know what PhD's have to say about this stuff.
---
any elonian changes the position as well, at least for light
---
Dont you agree the 300% dmg within range 300 to ur butt is a bit ridiculous? the adds that attack, basically kill you faster than ever in fractals 
---
how about taimi just pulls a kormir and becomes the new elder dragon, problem solved
---
$ pip install gitgud
---
I believe we did get confirmation about that, don't quite recall where though.
---
&gt;Eh, is she though?
---
From little I know, I've heard she is an excellent writer.
---
Sadly, temperament is a virtue, and it's just very disappointing she ruined her career.
---
On some level I've kinda forgiven her for what she had done. And I hope at some point she realizes it as well and apologizes to Deroir.
---
Let's be real for a sec. She was obviously going through some sort of issues, especially considering the timing it took place, July 4th, when most people were celebrating.  I do not know what specific issues haunt her, but I do hope her the best at some point coping. It can be very hard for some people to get help.
---
Now, I'm not approving of what she did that eventful day or anything. But I think it's important to acknowledge the whole of a person, and not just the bad. She did a lot for GW2, and there were others in the company who obviously appreciated her work as well, and had a huge respect for her. A side we haven't seen.
---
Maybe I'm just overthinking it. But I think the topic should be looked at with a bit more compassion in retrospect. Mental illness sucks. And I'm not saying that to gaslight. I just think that it's possible to forgive and move on.
---
OK GOOGLE, Wtf El-ahrairah
---
Plot armor thicker than Chinese wall.
---
I've only really played with the light and medium tops.  For heavy I see some dramatic repositioning with different bottoms and my entire fashion wars look for a character is based on finding something that doesn't swallow their weapons.
---
&gt;The whole setting of that map is just an invite for an epic battle, raging from the South to the North and culminating at the Keep.
---
I mean, yeah - "Thunderhead Keep" - it was a mission in GW1.
---
Gentlemen, i would like to just thank you for this topic - saved my sanity and a lot of disappointment.
---
Thread removed: Spoiler(s) are not allowed in titles, feel free to re-post this without the spoiler in the title.

Was getting nervous about you Tekkit. Got spoiled with last episode being up almost at launch lol. Thanks as always!
---
Question: Was your Necro the very same character as the one you were online on the moment you unlocked the achievements at the smith NPC?
---
"It took a fallen god to kill us."
---
&lt;cough&gt; Pocket raptors &lt;/cough&gt;

either cocks or jesse cox cant be too sure
---
But labour deserves compensation.
---
&gt; Fixed **a bug** in which the Hammer's Hoard point of interest could not be activated from outside of the gate.
---
That's just charming
---
Ya I had it spoiled in map chat too. Jerks.
---
Oh, no worries:-P Last time I had a lot of time to make it on the test server but this time we had a way shorter window, servers did not close every 10 minutes (what always allowed me to mark a lot of different spots) as they used to and I haven't much time during Christmas as well:-)
---
Sadly I can't mount up on that event, the mount never loads and my camera gets stuck Faaaaaaaaaaar behind. I guess it's the environment. It doesn't happens on other parts of the map.
---
im telling you adadadad spam increases your dps without food anyway this is how it works in my head
---
this, i remember this happening to me with the force awakens and 4chan
---
Sorry for the delay. The post had gotten a few reports and we're being a bit strict on spoilers due to the content of this episode so a few reports and we'll remove it. Mod team got the episode spoiled in barely an hour and we're trying to do what we can to help it not happen to other people.
---
But yeah basically just repost [Spoiler] in the title and make sure to flair as spoiler and it's good. 
---
Lmao I see, sorry man, Ive been thoroughly bamboozled
---
Years ago I found the charr cub and her strawberries. I was just exploring and noticed a pipe in the dump in Diessa. I got through, and it was a beautiful garden. Quiet. Serene. Magical. And there I find an adorable charr cub, raised only for war from her birth, taking care of her strawberries. It's silly, but one of the best videogame moments of my life.
---
Also, finally killing Caudecus was a good moment
---
So, first off; thank you so much for all the effort you put into this ❤️❤️ 
---
Second; I've already said that I'm making the GS (Caladbolg) and it's taking me A WHILE. I need mastery 4 on 2 of the HoT masteries, and I think mastery 3 on own and mastery 2 on one (maybe even mastery 5, not sure though) WHICH IS A LOT TO DO. I've been doing stuff in those maps and I've only leveled up a couple of times (in the hours I've spent there) only to get kinda bored off it ^^' and I've spent money on the creation of one of the ingredients, about 25-30 gold.
---
3rd; how do I craft the daily crafting stuff? Do I need to buy the ingredients? Oh and do I sell rare equipment (for 16 silver ish) or do I salvage them as well? 
---
4th; is Living Story 3 free? I don't think I have it :( (I did get beetle mount if that's Ls3)
---
5th; can you explain how to atttune and infuse a tiny bit more? :D
---
Not sure who she is or what she has done in the game itself. However.... that one little tid bit.
---
&gt;she gave an interview to Gamasutra in which she argued that lockboxes can provide a “value” to players that they can’t get any other way.
---
Yea..... 1st impressions of her not off to a good start. I'm not sure if I should miss her departure or celebrate.
---
Came for a theory on elder dragons, stayed because the TLDR had [my ranger's name in it](https://i.imgur.com/Aywv7gB.jpg) (had that name for several months now).
---
Though I would not say that Kralk has exclusive use of future site, divination, or what say you. As others mentioned there's been non-Elder Dragon beings who have seen into the future.
---
The only issue is how *detailed* of a vision did they see. We don't know if beings capable of seeing into the future are limited by clarity (detail), scope (how far they can see), or both.
---
Pistol/Shield is not a great PvE set, the two weapons just don't mesh well together.  Most of the time when you take Pistol mainhand, you are running a condition damage build.  By taking shield instead of pistol offhand, you're missing out on Blowtorch (Pistol 4), which is a large DPS boost.
---
Snowcrows lists [a support scrapper build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/scrapper/support/) that uses pistol/shield, but I wouldn't recommend running that in fractals.
---
you can solo all fractals but its not easy for the majority of the players, also to make it easier you can multibox (like with gw2launchbuddy)

Hey.... Spoilers
---
Between this and Z's comments regarding the next season of living world, the game's future is looking pretty bleak. I honestly can't get excited about a single raid and fractal a year with no expansion on the horizon.
---
*Cue George Michael*
---
This sounds fun, never get very far alone. And I had just started the game again after years.
---
I pvped a lot, did tournaments and stuff pre-HoT (got to rank 63 before they removed the insane leveling requirements). But in my opinion, elite specs completely killed pvp. They launched so poorly balanced, and are insanely overloaded compared to the core specs. A lot of the nuance and thought that went into fights were lost and the game turned into a boon/condi/evade clusterfuck where ultimately games were decided by team comp and not individual skill. 
---
It really was a lot of things together which killed pvp,
---
The learning curve of deciphering teamfights and interactions became way too high for new players, the reward systems came too late for veteran players, and the lack of balance ruined it for everyone. When a class is clearly overtuned, but you have to wait 6 months for a balance pass which may or may not fix it... why bother. 
---
You're right about fury, but there are other DPS classes that can make fury without losing anything, and there are a huge number of dps classes that just don't need spotter, since they already crit-cap with traits. And you don't need all spirits, only 2-3 (Frost + Sun and/or Stone, Storm shouldn't be needed, many classes make small/large amounts of vuln I think. Holo makes infinite vuln forever too). And yes pug chronos are never gonna do that lol
---
I tried that from Edit 2 now several times as well (Thief, Necro and Warrior each &gt;2x so far) - nothing worked... there is definitly something buggy/weird there
---
Removed: Obvious reasons. If you have an issue with this please feel free to submit a mod support ticket, we'll get back to you in 2-8 weeks. 
---
Instabilities are bad by design by I doubt anet will ever learn.
---
Maybe the new lead (Jennifer something I think) fixes all what's broken/obsolete/wrong with gw2. Starting with dungeons.
---
Lot of issues like this with armor lately. The Requium and Elegy armors for Light weight, at least on Human female that I've tested, are really really bad. Everything floats away. The Gem Aura outfit is equally as bad. 
---
I am more terrified of the implication that if we kill Kralkatorrik, at least one of the other Elder Dragons will be able to see the future too.
---
Also the comma
---
There is not. Anet is usually pretty quick with support, however the latest living season episode just dropped so they are likely a bit backed up. 
---
The moderating team is trying to do the best we can. This was a rough couple days. We got the ending spoiled to us in barely an hour.
---
As I said before the expansion launched though. Please make sure to report things that you see improperly marked as spoilers. If there are enough reports automod will remove it automatically and we can check it manually. We're only human and we will miss things even though we're trying our best. 
---
It's been absolutely impossible to avoid spoilers on this sub for this episode. Really frustrating, as someone who won't have time to finish the story until this weekend... I already know the big twist.
---
Oh no, giant crystal dragon godzilla can not only see the future; he's a smart boy too.
---
Firstly as Novaa says (What do you mean by solo?), and if you mean truly solo as not playing along/besides another player then: TP/ wintersday/ crafting/Mob farming/ Mad kings labyrinth/Solo dungeons/solo fractals/map completion/MF convert/gathering/PSMM from PSNA/ giveaway/ranked pvp. If you mean with no party or squad then these will be added on that: ‎Sw vw/Sw cf/Sw riba/Istan/fractals/dungeons/raids/TD/AB
---
What's the error code? 
---
Do you see a crash dump in your GW2 folder? If yes, copy/paste it into a text share. 
---
Great, now can we actually get a wardrobe skin for Rockcrusher?
---
This really bothers me...
---
You mean type it here? Or is there a way to share it straight from the app?
---
I don't care about golden samples and anecdotical evidences. I care about statistical significancy. Also my standards for stability are more than "yay it could run cinebench without crashing".
---
&gt;4.7ghz 9900k outperforms the 8700k at 5ghz in single core

lol no

&gt;ranger in wvw
---
literally anything you could do, another class can do better
---
I really don't want them to touch the old dungeons. They're going to fuck them up if they do and ruin all of my favorite map breakouts.
---
Who?
---
Heyho,
---
here is what I believe to have found out, feel free to add it to the post:
---
I tried overall three different characters with different professions (Warrior was only using Axe for all kinds of damage) and killed different kind of enemes all together below 10% HP without going above 10% within a few seconds (in Edit 2 mentioned spiders, branded dredges, oil elements, ...) over two days, and guess when it worked for me? Right, after I changed into a close to empty map instance - it literally worked first try there ... maybe it was just coincidence, but I believe that this achievement has a similar issue as "A Different Kind of Shatterer" (and I believe some others as well) so far - meaning that only one person on the map instance is able to get process with the achievement at the same time. 
---
Aka: Until ANet fixxed it, try to make sure via getting on empty instances and communication via map chat that you are the only one on the map who is trying to get the achievement. 
---
Obviously I could be wrong, but at this point I am running out of options.
---
&gt; become clear that we were lied to by Glint: Aurene could not survive the fight.
---
Glint never told us Aurene would survive.
---
Hoping they do a fix for the Rockcrusher and Ancestral Guard weapons, they don't have actual wardrobe unlockable skins even though they are unique.
---
&gt;  Balthazar tried to absorb magic from a single bloodstone and still left a radioactive crater.
---
No, that's not true. 
---
The white mantle caused the explosion, Balthazar just used the situation and absorbed the biggest part of the explosion, to empower himself. The explosin wasn't his fault, he actually saved us and many other lifes by absorbing it.
---
&gt;There's no guarantee that any of the gods could absorb an elder dragon's magic quickly or reliably enough to keep the world from exploding. 
---
It is, we already saw it a few times. 
---
We saw how Balthazar used Omadds machine to absorb Primordus and Jormags magic. And we saw that Balthazar used his own machine (that thing with Aurene inside) to absorb Kralkatorriks magic. 
---
We don't need to kill an elder dragon first, before we can absorb it's magic. We just can "suck him empty".
---
What if we just seal him inside a pocket within the mists?
---
I actually went into game and looked for it. Was there a heart vendor right next to it? Because then I found it. But it's only three juvenile and five regular ones. However, they almost downed me...
---
Turns out they're like pocket raptors. Die instantly if looked at, but damn they crit my 4k health Assassin's Mesmer for 400+, and you do have four of them on your hands the second you jump in.
---
Impressive.
---
Kralkatorik and the Sands of Time
---
At that point, I'd just use them on rares and save a few for exotics to clear bank space.
---
I got spoiled without even coming to the subreddit. I was just scrolling through my homepage and someone literally posted the ending scene and the picture was just loaded and visual for me (on mobile). It was literally a few hours after the update and I was still at work and I already knew the ending without even coming to this subreddit.
---
How do I get the rope around my Charr biceps?
---
yeah if you set your autoclicker to double click every ~6 seconds you can just leave it there stacking up
---
So much swag, much strut https://youtu.be/jrcu6KbcMcg a must have. Thank you. Anet make this happen.
---
To be honest, I see the fight as its own reward. Being in the bubble, hunted, struggling to survive while people outside can only watch, or vise versa. There isn’t really any fight I can name that gives quite the same satisfaction when you finally manage to best it.
---
If we ever got a dungeon team again, the only thing I'd like them to do with old dungeons is to go in and fix any bugs. Maybe an exploit or two, but nothing beyond that, leave everything as it was.
---
What we really need is a set of entirely new dungeons, with varying difficulty, but preferably on the harder side.
---
I'll have to keep an eye out for story POI ports.  If there's a porting service in the game that's deserving of tips at the moment, it's that one.
---
Not sure how you KNOW that it wasn't a bug fix. I mean, I agree, you're probably right and they probably just labeled it a bug fix, but there's really no way to know what was intended, unless you work at Anet.  Why be infuriated over something you might be wrong about?
---
For raids check out [Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/support/), for fractals [Discretize](https://discretize.eu/builds) and for all game modes [Metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Mesmer). They might not be completely up to date, as a new stat combo was introduced with this patch, but those builds should still top up on boon duration.
---
Chrono is still regarded by the community as the default boon bot with pulls and fractal skips, so it's still a strong option, although the Firebrand+Renegade combo is still a solid option and can output quickness and alacrity more reliably. Chrono pdps is also very good atm, if you want to go for that, on either fractals or raids.
---
Several types of dredge use sound to attack as well, so I agree that echolocation is probably a thing.
---
The unrecognized heros. You got it spoiled for yourself so others didn't have to. Genuinely thank you, you make this sub one of my favorite on all of Reddit. &lt;3
---
fuck, i wasn't even at the part yet where we found out Rytlock had a sled!
---
In case whoever stumbles on this post:
---
* Sieran, Forgal, Tybalt
---
* Trahearne
---
* Aurene
---
Showing up in literally the final minute of the expansion shouldn't really count. These voice interactions have just as much -- if not more -- substance as her PoF appearance did.
---
I know. It's like.. thirteen posts I've seen already with some clickbait title "Something EVERYONE is ignoring/I CAN NOT believe Anet did this in the story".. and it's just a generic opinion about the story. The whole subreddit was flooded with these posts the first few days of the stories release, imagine if they just all got shoved into a megathread.
---
Lucky you, I have seen my fair share of empty DS maps, it's especially bad for Oceanic players. When a new LS is released, the attendance for DS plummets even further.
