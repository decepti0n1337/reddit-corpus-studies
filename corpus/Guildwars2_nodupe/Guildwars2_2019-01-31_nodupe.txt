The old defiance system had many flaws but in some ways was much cooler than breakbars. Getting rid of Mai Trin's defiance stacks and hold back CC's to be able to pull her into the lightning field felt very rewarding.

I bought the dye actually haha.. not my first character

---
I've been trying to get the griffin mount over with, and have nearly completed all the requirements but have been stuck having to do this event. The NPC has been stuck in the same spot for over 24 hours, I have submitted a support ticked about the issue but can't help but feel frustrated at how long it's been going on.
---
Not sure if it's important but this is on the Henge of Denravi server, I am not sure how the servers work on GW2 other than there being a megaserver. I attempted to be a guest on other servers (don't know if i did it properly), but the NPC was still in the same position.
---
I guess the question stands whether there is something that I can do to bypass this annoyance, first thought being that I could transfer to another server but had issues with that method. If nothing else let this be another source to reach out to the GW2 staff maybe.
---
\-Humble Player Desperate to Get off the Ground
---
Thank you!! This character actually reached lvl 80 recently but I still like drawing him in this outfit cus it's simple haha 
---
I had a problem like this once, physically reseating my graphics card fixed it in that instance
---
It hasn't been announced, so anywhere between this fall and never would be my guess.
---
Absolutely nothing you said is observable fact. Get fucking real.
---
Check right after the Dailys refresh and see if that resets it.
---
That looks very refreshing. Not a dirty charr engineer, not a grinning asura engineer, not a flashy overdressed human. Thanks for sharing!
---
So, it seems like you recently watched The Lion King.
---
Exactly.
---
Pretty much.
---
 You obviously never been headbutted by a Charr. That stuff hurts so bad you'll be completely paralyzed with pain for 3 whole seconds!
---
Your inability to comprehend =/= my necessity to "get fucking real".  I suggest you get your arse out of your post-modern, neo-marxist arse and get real yourself.
---
I honestly have no idea. Definitely not how devs push a certain design decision for which players vocally refuse to pay real money, while apologists scream "don't buy it if you don't like it (and shut up because your opinion annoys us)".
---
I think warrior should get focus, but instead of casting spells they throw it like a boomerang
---
Lol are devs pushing this aesthetic? Will people not buying this outfit tank the game? I'm just not sure what you're implying
---
Supporting the platform at the hero point southwest of the Cathedral of Glorious Victory in the Straits of Devastation are 4 pillars that each have an interaction point at one of their corners.  I have not been able trigger any events by manipulating them alone or with a  group.  Does anyone know what (if anything) they do?
---
Well, the question isn't if they would make a profit, it is "is the development time of making this happen worth the profit compared to other things we can put time and money into". I know a lot of people think otherwise, but ArenaNet has people who monitor the time and money investment vs what they get out, and it is possible they've already done the math on this one in the five + years of Guild Wars 2.
---
And while I agree that I would THINK the investment would be worthwhile, maybe that's simply not true -- we can't see the numbers, we don't know for sure. All we can do is keep insisting that, as a community, we want it to happen.
---
Fingers crosses that it will, I haven't really thought about it but i've never noticed the game doing a server wipe. I would think that would be a quick fix, although one that forces everyone out of the game for a blurp of time lol.

are u bad at math or do u not know that the price you are quoting includes mystic clovers
---
2am on a Sunday... That's quite suicidal but doable because yay for CNY day off. But I checked online it says Saturday 830pm for us... How do you check?
---
Nobody expects LS5 that soon, especially not the dude who's comment we're talking about.
---
&gt;if we presume 6 episode in LS5, and we'll count 2,5 months between episodes (so the same standards we are used to so far), that's 18 months before we see the next expansion. **That, and** I personally think that we will get a small hiatus
---
Yea you see I did exactly this like 6 times, no luck. I then did warrior and got it. Other people are the other way around, or no luck at all. Its just very iffy.
---
I agree. I have some outfits but I almost never use them because I can't mix and match.
---
Karma boosters back in some form would be especially nice.
---
Awesome! Rare to see another fellow sg dude on gw2. I know it's deviating from the original topic but can I pm you to ask whether you are in any SG guild?
---
I nade 10g before giving up, even with script its too much work \^\^
---
\-clip missing-
---
Awesome! I love the style!
---
Im from Philippines though but yeah nice to see someone from sea playing this game too. 
---
For guild, I have 2 active guilds atm, one International and one Filipino guild. 
---
&gt;I just picture like Charr that are like working on mixing up some type formula, look over to grab an ingredient they need, horns bopping the formula as they try to grab what they needed
---
Unlikely.  Observe any creature that actually has antlers.  It is amazing how well they can manage them - to the point where I've observed deer in full antler just walk straight through the middle of heavy scrub rotating the antlers about exactly as required so they didn't hit anything.  Admittedly, mistakes happen sometimes, but they don't bumble about like we would with a set of horns strapped to our heads.
---
not really, i hated them because they were annoying more than anything in HoT
---
You said you were not talking about exp, but that is in fact (part of) your answer. You need experience to fill a mastery bar, and then you need mastery points to unlock a mastery with full bar. Since gliding is part of HoT, you need to earn HoT experience and HoT mastery points to unlock gliding masteries.
---
HoT metas should give you good experience.
---
the only thing I hate about it is the same thing I hate about mount skins and toys. They're on the gem store. But even if they weren't, they'd probably massive gold sink, which is basically either grind the repetitive stuff or spend money.
---
Agreed. I will never pay money for an Outfit, no matter how cool it looks, but I would have dropped **SO** much money on armor bundles. 
---
The most important, if most time consuming QoL overhaul that they need to make to this game is to unify the armor weights, make them all interchangeable so that you can mix and match any piece with any other piece. I understand that this would mean stretching and re-texturing a ton of armor pieces, but it's worth the effort in the long run, and the earlier they get on it, the less effort it will take. 
---
If you have spare laurels, you can buy Plague Doctor trinkets from one of the living story chapters for them.
---
For Shaman or Magi gear, you can buy the insignia off the trading post to stat swap some ascended gear to one (probably shaman's). Magi's trinkets are hard: You probably will need to get the mist trinkets or use map trinkets for them.
---
Apothecary insignias are super expensive but you can get rings/necklaces for cheap.
---
Obvious that someone would post it. 
---
fuck no
---
I was under the impression the eye of ~~god~~ Janthir showed us where he was **currently** causing chaos, which was deep in the crystal desert. Then refugees from Amnoon specifically started showing up in LA which led the commander and crew to head directly there. It could be possible that Balthazar went to the causeway first but didnt cause as much chaos as there was no need to do so, and then started his campaign in the crystal oasis.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Im not denying that its incredibly unlikely and probably wont happen, but I there is still a slight possibility he was there.
---
I miss understood that then. Was not aware that the exp for the mastery bar and the normal exp for mastery points are basically both just exp. 
---
I thought that I maybe could've earned it faster if I used special spots for gliding or sth. 
---
Not entirely sure I understand that sentence, but if you just want to play PvP, you’ll be fine. You might miss out on some useful stat combinations and easy ascended trinkets for WvW though.
---
Ty man and all of uthanks a lot
---
I'd guess they'd want a big dick.
---
A personal portal that, out of combat, can trasport you to any previously explored open world location.
---
[Alliance patch](https://youtu.be/xOIF1JDpddQ) is in the works but b4 that we are losing commanders and die hard WvWers so move could either turn out as a total waste of money or salvaging some fun for WvW rewards.
---
I don't think anything you said here disagrees with what OP said, though. "The expression just didn't preserve his character" is valid criticism -- nothing was said about Rytlock not being *allowed* to cry or feel sad. They just felt that the artist had trouble capturing how Rytlock would look when he's sad, which is fair, because you probably don't suddenly start looking like an entirely different creature when you cry, either.
---
I agree that trying to convey the emotion on a creature who's not human was probably a large part of the difficulty (the artist is clearly talented and what they were doing was certainly not easy!), but that doesn't change the fact that it didn't really turn out looking like Rytlock. 
---
The problem is that it is a mix of art and a product that has been bought, and this is only amplified by the fact that it is constantly in development.
---
Of course I will criticise a game that I feel has shifted away from producing content that I really enjoyed (HoT) to stuff that I don't so much. Is that narrowminded? Not really truth be told. Being narrowminded would be to discredit or ignore others opinions, or see my opinion as the only opinion - which is simply not the case. There is unfortunately a lot of narrowmindedness in this thread - particularly on this subreddit anyone with an unpopular opinion will always face backlash, and frankly it is what it is. I wish we all could have a good discussion without feeling the need to constantly discredit a point of view.
---
Old defiance system was rudimentary but fun at times. I wish the current breakbar has tiers so you break first layer of bar, it's a short stun but if you destroy another layer of bar within the stun then it's susceptible to first hard cc - looking at you ice bow 5. Though a knockback would be annoying haha
---
i assume by 18 slot inventory expansion, you mean bag and not really the inventory expansion (400 gem)?
---
will definitely try to join the train if time allows, thanks for the event!

[Wiki has pages](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Story_summary) on all the story chapters with small sections on each part but I can go over the very basics below:
---
[Personal story](#s "Start of story depends on race and choice but all stories start get introduced to the 3 orders and start to meet up with members of the old Destiny's Edge group. Learn about the orders and pick one to join, you get a mentor from that order. Destiny's Edge tries to reform but end up arguing and splitting off into the dungeon story modes [they reform as a side story to the main one]. With your order you help some of the "tribal" races against dragon minions. Trahearne learns of a coming attack by Zhaitan and your order sends you to claw island to deal with it. The fort is lost and your mentor stays to cover you. Trahearne visits the pale tree, she gives him Caladbolg and shows him a vision of Orr with him leading a unified pact of the 3 orders. The player retakes claw island with the help of the orders joining forces and the start of the pact. The pact invades Orr, weakens Zhaitan then face off against and finally kill Zhaitan.")

Rox, a gladium that lost her warband, is sent to retake a hatchery as a test to join Rytlock's warband. The Molten Alliance base is found, Rox and Braham band together to fight their common enemy (some of the story can still be played in the fractals Molten Furnace and Molten Boss.
---
The Secret of Southsun: Refugees from Molten Alliance attacks were offered new homes in Southsun by the Consortium but are now bound there by contract, some feel like they are now prisoners. Riots and general issues happening all over the island. Kasmeer Meade shown on island as one of the nobles there. Wildlife being riled up by toxin introduced to the area by a mysterious sylvari suspected of being Canach.")
---
[Last Stand at Southsun:](#s "Canach is in hiding from assassination attempts by Subdirector Noll of the Consortium. Canach feels sympathy for the refugees and has been trying to free them. Canach's hideout is found and he is captured but had already marked Consortium record locations for Karka attacks [events are still active on the island]. Ellen Kiel, part of the captains council of Lion's Arch, gathers all the contracts to send them to Lion's Arch for safe keeping but Kiel sets of an explosive destroying the ship and contracts. Kiel claim's that the attack was Canach's doing and the settlers are now free to leave.")
---

During the ceremony the pyre explodes injuring the council members and others. Later announced that one of the council, Captain Theo Ashford, did not survive. Logan Thackeray finds Marjory Delaqua and hires her to investigate the attack since Ashford was a close friend. Marjory, a former member of the ministry guard, encounters 'E' [she doesn't see them] during an investigation and is asked work together to stop the forces that would take down the world. Marjory and Kiel find out the explosion was triggered by Mai Trin, her plan was to fill the newly emptied council seat. The player attempts to capture her but her Aetherblade pirates show up and she escapes.")
---

It is discovered that the Aetherblade pirates are backed by the inquest. Mysterious person 'Scarlet' mentioned. Ellen Kiel is nominated for the empty council seat.")
---
[Bazaar of the Four Winds:](#s "Zephyrites and new zone Labyrinthine Cliffs introduced. Evon Gnashblade, owner of the Black Lion Trading Company, is running against Kiel for the council seat and they need trade agreement with the Zephyrites. Zephyrites are discovered to be the successors to the Brotherhood of the Dragon and have connections to glint as her current servants after the dwarves.")
---
[Cutthroat Politics:](#s "Election for council held, Kiel wins and gets trade agreement. Backstory given on both Kiel and Gnashblade.")
---
[Queen's Jubilee:](#s "Anniversary of Queen Jennah's ascended the throne in Divinity's reach. West area [used to be a large hole] is transformed into the crown pavilion. Jubilee [new area] is introduced with arenas to fight in. Watchknights are introduced as guards and have the ability to transform with mesmer magic into the enemies in the jubilee.

---
[Clockwork Chaos](#s "During the closing ceremony of the jubilee the Previous assailant appears again and is revealed to be a sylvari by the name of 'Scarlet Briar'. Scarlet takes control of the watchknights and attempts to kidnap the queen. The player disarms 4 bombs around the pavilion but Scarlet reveals that there is a fifth bomb at the evacuation point that explodes killing many. Scarlet teleports into the arena level with hostages and no access into the area. Player gets more information on Scarlet's [given name Ceara ] backstory, she rejected the lifestyle and path of the sylvari instead seeking out knowledge from many teachers across Tyria including Norn, Charr, and Asura. She becomes fascinated with the 'Eternal Alchemy' and believes it will give her access to the basic fabric of reality. Omadd, the Headmaster of Synergetics, and her teacher while enrolled in the college tracks Scarlet down and offers her an experiment that will allow her to view the ' metaphysical vortex of reality'. When she awakes from the experiment she says she saw 'everything', says her name is now Scarlet, and then kills Omadd. After some time Scarlet's portal technology is reverse engineered and the player is able to rescue the people trapped in the arena but scarlet escapes thanks to the aetherblade pirates. ")

---
[Tower of Nightmares](#s "The lake is Kessex Hills is discovered to have strange activity going on and possibly a mesmer veil covering it. Kasmeer Meade is called in to remove the illusion and eventually does, revealing a large plant tower. The krait and nightmare court have formed the Toxic Alliance and are defending the tower. The tower spreads a toxic mist around it that causes hallucinations and sickness. Toxic seedlings start appearing in the surrounding area [seedling events as well as parts of the tower are still in the zone now]. Marjory Delaqua works on and eventually makes an antitoxin to allow people to enter the tower safely.")
---
[The Nightmares Within](#s "Marjory and Kasmeer assault the tower with the player and meet up with Braham and Rox who are searching for scarlet. The tower is guarded by molten alliance, toxic alliance, aetherblade and clockwork minions. The group reaches the top of the tower and fight what the krait believe to be their prophet but is birthed from a pod like sylvari and is called the 'hybrid'. Marjory was able to improve the antitoxin and destroy the tower. Parts of the tower can be played in the Nightmare Fractal.")

They also confirm that everything has been her doing and that she is planning a raid on Lion's Arch.")
---
[Escape from Lion's Arch:](#s "")
---
Yes, I do miss the Forged too, and out of all the villain groups they may be the most deserving of redemption as they were once the heroic Eternals (veterans of the Eternal Battle against Menzies's Shadow Army) who were brainwashed/tortured/otherwise forced into committing atrocities against the Elonian population to boost their numbers for Balthazar's campaign. Devona/Herald's [scrolls](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Strange_Burning_Scroll) in "Night of Fires" even revealed that a few of the Forged officers were being conflicted over their orders, and Devona had to reassure them that times had changed, that the ends justified the means, and that they had to adapt to their new orders or suffer Balthazar's wrath. The scrolls also mentioned the unseen General of the Burning Forest who was ordered to travel south to prepare for Balthazar's coming, but the general never showed up in any of the PoF maps to my knowledge.
---
While we have Zafirah with us (who collaborated with the Zaishen and the Forged), we could use her as an emissary to try to approach the Forged and convince them to join our side now that we're trying to stop Kralkatorrik. However, these negotiations should be tense as we try to explain to the Forged why Balthazar's approach was bad whereas ours is better, and Zafirah might help them realize what they already know deep inside: the Balthazar they had once loved and respected had fallen from grace long before his death, and perhaps the devs could even sprinkle in hints about Balthazar's potential successor in the Six (after all, as shown with Abaddon and Dhuum, a god's stripped divinity has to be absorbed by another or the results could be volatile).
---
If I were to reintroduce the Forged to the story at this point, there's a perfect living world map location for it: [A map in the Desolation containing the Sulfurous Wastes, Dynastic Tombs, Remains of Sahlaja, and Joko's Domain](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/guide/?v=4&amp;x=-1466.3125&amp;y=1070.375&amp;z=3).
---
This area could be our tie-in to continue the Forged, Joko and Abaddon plots and explain why Balthazar was using the Realm of Torment (at a time when Kormir technically was still in the Sanctum which is part of the RoT) to stage Forged invasions from as suggested in the Maws of Torment meta in the Desolation. :)
---
Perhaps the General of the Burning Forest mentioned in Devona's scrolls could be stationed in the Sulfurous Wastes with the surviving Forged since Balthy's defeat, researching the area's Margonite ruins for Abaddon's knowledge. If we successfully convince the Forged to join us, we could investigate the [Great Margonite Temple](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Great_Margonite_Temple), which was supposed to be Abaddon's seat of power in the merged realms after his victory in Nightfall, for the God of Secrets's remaining secrets hidden deep within. We could even run into [Captain Mehhan](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Captain_Mehhan), General Morgahn's old friend, who was tainted by Abaddon's touch during the Kournan campaign, and could technically have lived for centuries if the taint turned him into a demonic Margonite over the years or otherwise gifted him with unnatural powers.
---
Further investigation of the [Dynastic Tombs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dynastic_Tombs), the tragic ruins of the once prosperous [Sahlaja](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Remains_of_Sahlahja_\(outpost\)) which Joko sacked before GW1 story, and [Joko's Domain](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Joko%27s_Domain) (we only see the northern bit of it in GW2 Desolation compared to the more expanded area in GW1) could likewise shed light on the origins of Joko's immortality and lichdom, why he began building the Bone Palace in the Desolation in particular, and if him [possessing some of Abaddon's scriptures](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ascension_Pilgrim) (or possibly making a deal with a very powerful djinn who [only granted a wish once per century](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/One_Man%27s_Dream) in Vabbi's Forum Highlands, which could also tie neatly into Qadim and the cabal's [lore](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zommoros%27s_Journal) from Mythwright Gambit raid, as Joko was known to possess a map to a mysterious djinn overlord) allows us to find forbidden knowledge about the origins of the Elder Dragons and discover something else we can use against Kralkatorrik.
---
What if Abaddon had used memory crystals similar to Glint's (from the recent "Scion &amp; Champion" instance) which operate on an [adaptable, reactive magical AI](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/804120/#Comment_804120) that recorded his thoughts (think of the holocrons from Star Wars) so we could actually converse with an Abaddon AI (and hear Abaddon's voice from before his fall from grace!) and learn some of his forbidden secrets. It could also be a nice tie-in to bring back the enigmatic Mist entity [Razah](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Razah) who Abaddon had unknown plans for (there had to be a reason why Razah was hidden in the very heart of Abaddon's domain, and I've wondered if Razah was supposed to be Abaddon's son after there were datamined entries of a [graveyard](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Abaddon%27s_Dead_Children) of Abaddon's rebellious children), and maybe even figure out the fate of the Margonites as Linsey Murdock said that a scrapped plot for GW Beyond would'e involved us meeting surviving Margonites. Just imagine the lore on [Mallyx](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mallyx_the_Unyielding) or [Lord Jadoth](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Lord_Jadoth)...
---
Given how Kralk's shenanigans are now upsetting the balance of the Mists and making ghosts leak into Tyria, this proposed map could also have us interact with the ghost of Margonite [Varesh Ossa](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Varesh_Ossa) too. It's really been unfortunate that both Varesh (the Kournan front villain working for big bad Abaddon) and General Morgahn (a Kournan antivillain who joined the heroes' side after realizing Varesh's descent to madness too late), notable characters from Nightfall, haven't been referenced anywhere in PoF or Season 4, so exploring Margonite and Desolation lore could tell us more about them.
---
If the devs wanted to be really sweet aside from all the above references, it would be wonderful to see a pocket of [Zhed Shadowhoof](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Zhed_Shadowhoof)'s centaur descendants survive despite Joko killing off most of the Veldrunners and Losaru prides in Elona. If there was any place where Joko might not look for survivors, it would be the most inhospitable area in Elona and the Crystal Desert, so theoretically some centaurs could've survived the genocide up to the present day deep within the Sulfurous Wastes which are now barely habitable. While I understand the devs likely want to keep the centaurs' fate tragic and have them all be killed off between the games, I'd welcome a glimmer of hope by having these few survivors join forces with us to earn their peace at long last while the repenting Awakened make amends with them.

---
if you get to bash a game as objectively a failure because you personally dislike it for whatever biased reason you can pull out of a hat (the content's boring/they changed my favorite skill/outfits are dumb), I can discredit that argument in a fashion that shows the fallacy of said argument. in this case, the argument is that the content is boring to *you* and the OP without actually citing specifics as to what content is boring, *how* it's boring (that one's pretty important), and the statistics of people saying the same thing. oddly enough, all of those arguments *can* be biased but they don't *have* to be. you can be very specific about how a certain event is narratively, mechanically, or visually boring. 
---
coincidentally, people said the same thing about HoT when it came out. funny how that works out.
---
no one - *no one* - should ever expect a developer to take every single suggestion that their official forum or subreddit or whatever and implement it into their game. that strategy only works when the majority of the playerbase uses those outlets, and from my recollection that development style never lasts for too long as more people join and play the game. unfortunately, GW2 does not have that same atmosphere and as an MMO, is unfeasible to use since not everyone will use the forum or subreddit or whatever. case in point, there's exactly 198,369 people subscribed this specific subreddit and I'm genuinely positive there's many more active players spread across three specific regions (US, EU, SE) and two different clients (western and Chinese).
---
hell, I've heard suggestions ranging anywhere from making Reaper's "Rise!" skill having no body count cap to *removing the gem store*. keep in mind, "Rise!" is not GW1's Shambling Horror skill. they act nearly identically except for a very specific game mechanic: body blocking. can't body block in GW2, so the strategy of grouping up your enemies behind a wall of undead creatures is effectively dead (pun very much intended). mind you, this was a suggestion made during the HoT days for *PvE* - and it would work the same way for WvW... in zerg fights... with tons of dead bodies... see why that would be a problem?
---
the second suggestion is just silly at a base level. the gem store is their *consistent monetary revenue source*. a lot of people think that selling expansions can cover the difference but if they're at all active on this subreddit then they would have noticed the number of people asking whether or not they should buy the expansions. without them asking that question, they may not *ever* buy the expansions and thus they're a lost customer with lost revenue and all the problems that entails. meanwhile, the gem store is almost open to everyone - among the prohibited items are gliders (an expansion feature), passes (which are unnecessary anyway), and the Plush Quaggan Pack (apparently). I'm sure that list is a bit longer but I doubt by so much that it makes the gem store an nonviable revenue source for both free and B2P players.
---
those are just two examples I distinctly remember from GW2's suggestion past and some arguments to support the idea that they're not so great.
---
look, I didn't mean to come off so harsh and I *do* in fact love discussing these kinds of things but if the crux on your disposition is that you don't like PoF's content because it's not fulfilling, you're going to have to tell me *why* in order for me to counter it with an equally thought-out reply in order to facilitate the discussion further. otherwise we're making vague, blanket statements and the true meat of the discussion ends there as the only viable route forward is laced with insults and "no-you're-wrong's", which has no room in a discussion or debate. it's being an asshole.
---
Shares the skin with [one of the Weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Qadim%27s_War_Gavel) from the latest raid, a mace (the Mystic Forge one), so probably a skin that really shouldn't be there.
---
I have the same problem, except I started out as an engineer main, and have found myself increasingly unable to play the class I love as my joints get worse and worse. Luckily, I discovered I can play the no-kit holosmith build just fine, which minimizes button-pressing and still does really good damage.
---
*However*, if you're not already in love with engineer like I was, it's probably better to go with something else (when the meta changes in the future, engineers are likely back to intensive hand-movements again). I don't know exactly what parts you have trouble with, but for me, it's the hand-stretches to hit the utility keys. I can stretch from 1-5 up to F1-F4 just fine, but any build that relies on *frequently* hitting 7-0 in order to do respectable damage with its rotation is just more than my hand can handle sometimes.
---
So any build that uses signets that are mostly used for their passives, or other abilities that are situational and/or long cooldowns usually works best for me. I fractal and raid regularly as a Bannerslave warrior (both vanilla power and condi zerker depending on the fight) and do fine with those. I set my banners to 8 and 9, and most of the time can just set 'em and forget 'em and not worry about having to stretch back to those keys often. I've also had some success as a daredevil, so long as I'm able to reach Fist Flurry okay. It requires some dodging to work the rotation properly though, so if you have trouble hitting whatever you use for dodge (I double-tap) this one won't work well for you.
---
If you don't already have one, I recommend a mouse with programmable side buttons, too. It doesn't have to have a ton like the Naga, just one or two can really help take some of the strain off of your left hand by letting you tap what it can't reach with your right thumb instead. I have my weapon-swap key and my elite both bound to my mouse even for regular play, and can bind my utilities there too if my joints are really bad and/or I'm messing around playing a class with a more difficult rotation. I managed condi engi this way for literally *years* (though going no-kit power holo was easier and less strain on both hands overall).
---
&gt; This is another case of the community going 180 on something once they experience the alternative, like how suddenly everyone loves HoT now that we have PoF.
---
This has more to do with the age of the content or practice and the content that came after it than how much people actually like it.  The people who hate something usually move on once stuff they do like is released so the only people who are still talking about the old stuff are people who liked the old stuff.
---
I personally still hate playing HoT's maps when I go to grab some hero points for a new character or when I'm going for map complete.  I don't just care enough to complain any more because: 
---
1. there is so much more newer content than it that I do enjoy (especially PoF),
---
1. PoF's mounts makes exploring HoT's maps so much faster and easier,
---
1. I've gotten most of the masteries unlocked already,
---
1. I can now enter the maps with a fully unlocked elite spec,
---
1. and most importantly the only thing left for me to do in HoT (other than getting hero points on new characters) is to play the meta events which is the one thing I really liked about the expansion in the first place.
---
If Anet released another expansion with HoT's like progression then you will probably see the people like me who hated HoT come out of the woodwork.  
---
If on the other hand they take the best of both expansions by having all the progression be front loaded onto 3 to 4 PoF exploration focused maps and then have 1 or 2 HoT meta events focused maps with good loot then you will probably see most people praising it.
---
Thank you! this is much cheaper than what showed up at first!
---
&gt;us if it means anything? N
---
Yes, just thought they would follow Kralk instead. But what Vincent said is also true.
---
Male Elonian Elementalist doesn't make sense. Somehow over the last 250 years elementalists forgot how to wear pants (https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Elementalist_Istani_armor_m.jpg).
---
i spend tons of money on outfits..
---
Here we go again.
---
&gt;Part of) Mordremoth's magic, Joko's magic, and Blish have all been eaten by the same dragon now. Hopefully you follow my line of reasoning here.
---
Did he get Joko's from killing Aurene? Spooky.
---
If this really is run by ArenaNet, I think there's a different way to potentially take it and it could be a hint.
---
I don't know if it necessarily makes sense to look at it as "stuff eaten by Kralkatorrik." For one thing, as you already note not all of Modremoth's magic was eaten. For another, I don't think we can really say that Joko's magic was eaten by him. It was eaten by Aurene, and there is no evidence that Kralkatorrik actually consumed her magic. Heck, some of the speculation has been based specifically on the fact that he doesn't seem to have and whether or not he may eventually wish to. Finally, for this to work it would be Mordremoth's *magic* and Joko's *magic* and then for Blish, NOT his magic, but just his person.
---
I think it makes much more sense to simply interpret it as "people who died." Mordremoth died, then Joko and Blish "followed him" by dying, too. If this is really the joke, then there is a conspicuous absence of someone else who died in the very same timeframe as Joko and Blish, suggesting, perhaps, that they are not really dead.
---
Yeah.. I just wanted to get sure, that you are up to date and then state something similar &gt;! (but with spoiler tag :P) !&lt;
---
he looks like a dickbutt
---
Honestly? If you haven't activated it yet, sell it. 
---
You'll get much more value out of the Gold now rather than adding it to your home instance and mining it for years to gain the equivalent sale price.
---
what are the top 5 goals as a fresh 80?
---
Yeah, it wasn't obvious the first time I looked at the art, but subsequent viewings have made it pretty apparent. And looking at it closer even makes it seem less like he's Skrittish or cute (because his eyes look big zoomed out) as opposed to a little tired.
---
A raid of them would be cool.
---
So if you double click it, it'll go into all your characters' Home Instances. The location of a character's Home Instance depends on their race - a Norn's Home Instance is in Hoelbrak, a Sylvari's is in The Grove, a Human's is in Divinity's Reach, an Asura's is in Rata Sum, and a Charr's is in the Black Citadel. 
---
You can mine this node in your Home Instance once per day, once per account. So if you use the node, log in with a Charr and mine the node, you can't mine it on a Norn or a Human that day.
---
It will appear in your home instance and you'll be able to mine it once a day (or anyone who joins your home instance). Note that you cant mine same nodes from different instances.
---
If that doesn't sound good you can try to sell it on tp (if it's not account bound already). 
---
uh... BDO?
---
maybe not a good option, though. open-world PvP in the late game... a super in-depth and confusing life skills system... horses...
---
but you can play as a cutie-pa-tootie Asian gril, so that's pretty cool.
---
Screen shot isn't hard, you press "Print Screen" in your keyboard, paste it into paint and save...
---
This happens to me semi-regularly...  When I am lagging and try to mount up my character freezes but I can still move (use the mini map for guidance), and after a few seconds it'll skip ahead to wherever I've run to.  If I hit certain surfaces while my character is still frozen I will end up under the map.  Fun to explore sometimes, but often annoying if I'm in the middle of something.  
---
If you really want Nevermore or the Greatswords, just go for it. You won't be able to use them in raids or fractals, but you can use them in open world, and more people are going to see them in open world than in instanced content anyway.
---
OK, *time* out on the puns now
---
&gt; or if using windows using the 'Snipping Tool' program
---
I mean I just hit print screen on windows... I thought that was available on every PC.
---
Bodysnatchers, from the Mists.
---
Theyd sell much more outfits and armor skins though.
---
And how many people buy transmutations anyway? Its not that difficult to earn them in game
---
Yeah bad wording there, I went and re-wrote it. Print screen should work everywhere as long as you have that button on your keyboard.
---
Snipping tool is really nice if you want to screenshot just a small part of the screen though like OP did.
---
refine them with artificer click 5 times profit?

What a juicy reply! Im not a gw1 type, never really got into it, but what youre suggesting sounds interesting enough. I didnt know that about the forged, i figured they were new to gw2 (even though I think i got the achieve for that scroll thing, im ashamed in myself). And the internal turmoil about following Balthazars commands is really interesting, further reason I want to see more of their lore in game. Who knows, your map idea makes enough sense to me, and despite the gw1 heavy implication there could definitely be current story reasons to go.
---
Mechanically I thought they were better than Mordrem (snipers and stalkers with huge health bars are garbage design imo) but narratively I found the forged to be a huge let down.
---
There were hints of forged having some story behind them with Devona as the forged champion we kept fighting (it's never fully confirmed in game that it is in fact Devona) but it's just a glimmer of story and depth and never fully explored (like most of GW2's villains or even peripheral characters).
---
Compare the forged to Nightfall's characters Morgahn, Kehanni and Varesh. They were characters that had stories and motivations, people of faith and belief, in their gods, in their nation, in their leaders etc and it evolved over the course of the story. 
---
Morgahn is an honorable general loyal to his leader Varesh Ossa, (who is descended from Turai Ossa the legendary Elonian hero who vanquished Palawa Joko, bringing Prosperity to Elona). Varesh was raised to be a great general and leader for Kourna, but also a person with spiritual interests (Morgahn was one her teachers and is himself both a brilliant general and a devout follower of Lyssa). When Varesh's studies and ambition leads to her being manipulated by the forgotten god Abbaddon into working towards fulfilling a Prophecy to free him, going as far as to sacrifice or even murder her own people, including Kehanni, a priestess of Lyssa and close friend of Morgahn, Kehanni's death becomes the final straw to convince Morgahn, a loyal general to Kourna, to turn his back on the woman he taught as a child to become the leader she is today and fight against her. He becomes a traitor to his own people in order to save them and the story explores both his loyalty to Kourna and his (and Varesh's aspirations for it) and his faith and worship of Lyssa and all the good things she stands for (arts, crafts, performance etc) and the prosperity it represents.
---
A story like that would have been possible to some extent with Balthazar and the forged. Someone like Zaffirah, fighting the awakened, fighting the branded - fighting for her people and bolstered by her literal god returned to save Tyria from the Elder Dragon plague after centuries of their absence, including Kormir who ascended and seemingly did nothing. That story was there to be told through the forged and how a worshipper of Balthazar ends up becoming one, but instead it's muddled by making most forged appear as nothing more than constructs with no known identities, or obscured identies of long dead heroes (forged are recent appearances on Tyria so either Balthazar went to Devona's grave and brought her back as forged, or more likely pulled her spirit from the Mists and gave it a metal body to serve him on Tyria). Devona certainly embodies the spirit of Balthazar but it only confuses the story of Balthazar's return to Tyria and how living Elonians (or others) dealt with his return and the potential horror of what his return did to Elona. Zaffirah is a welcome addition to the story but she simply comes too late.
---
Guild Wars 1 was much better at telling stories like this and while GW2 invests heavily into Living World and it has more modern gameplay etc, it really falls flat at delivering the more complex narratives that GW1 was able to explore. I'm not saying GW1's story was world class, but it was better imo - for the reasons I outlined above - than what GW2 is offering these days. Focusing so much on Aurene and Taimi means we keep missing the opportunity to explore the more interesting themes going on in the background, left to the imagination or speculation rather than represented in the primary narrative.
---
&gt; start any difficult fight mounted
---
It's open world who cares? There aren't any difficult fights. Any good player already does start on the mount to help nuke bars since so many people don't even try to break them.
---
Yeah but ease of use is no good arguement.
---
Dragonhunter literally places his 2 traps, Greatsword 4 then Greatsword 2 and deals like five times a Necros damage and don't even get me started on AoE because Guardians hit up to 5 Targets with this shit.  
---
Dragonhunter is known as Newbro Class but its really stable and really good additional support on top of its damage.  
---
It's generally worth it to use the filter options when looking for popular stuff like Berserker gear in the TP.
---
Especially weapons tend to have named variants, which might just have the stats you're looking for.
---
If you have too much Karma, you can also get Zerk gear from the temple of Grenth in Cursed Shore, or from AC, CoE or Arah dungeon tokens. Not everything has to be paid for in gold!
---
That's not the point. He wants ARMOR pieces. So do I.
---
I would love them to be armor, too. 
---
I would just kill to have a kirin as a mount. I've wanted that since Guild Wars 1.
---
Mirages use axe+torch+Pistol, or staff or scepter in some niche builds.  
---
I think astralaria looks great and is really fun to do the collection.  
---
But you should really wait up with the leggy...they cost a fortune and require a lot of dedication and account-bound mats to make. Astralaria requires to have almost all HoT masteries maxed.
---
and aoe skills?
---
HIGH DPS IS BETTER THAN LOW DPS 
---
CHANGE MY MIND
---
Supports cannot clear raids without dps but dps can clear raids without support. *Change my mind.
---
Heh, well I always appreciate Art.  It takes a lot to put yourself out there.  Just feels like there aren't many fans of Kormir is all.
---
Thank you sir! :)
---
Thank you sir. I meeded that information! :) 
---
Haha I totally understand. I have a job on a shift basis but I normally work 32 hour weeks. Aside from working out and time with my girlfriend. The grind and some music are always good. (Also that sounded dirty...Ill leave it there) its like meditation sometimes. I have to concentrate a lot at work and quality in action and in speech are constantly required. So I like a bit of mindlessness that gets me better stuff in game.
---
......sir. Thank you. Really...*drops everything to do boss I just misses*
---
I'm too old to be really good at PvP, but I still enjoy it to a degree outside of some balance issues that are quite universally criticized.
---
I'm also not really good at my PvE rotations either, but it's sufficient to clear content. Suffice to say I can still enjoy all kinds of content in GW2.
---
My pet peeve is people who whine and cry for things to lowered for them instead of either getting better or just accepting that things are out of reach. Story too hard? Please nerf. Raids too hard? Easy mode please.
---
If I'm no longer fit for a marathan I ain't going to complain to the organizers to make a shitty 500m marathan for me, I'll train myself if I really want to or just bid those who can a good run and fun time.
---
I don't think you'd be too old for raids. I'm a bit older than you, and am doing this content weekly. I'd say just keep on practicing, don't give up. Eventually you'll get used to the cues the game give you (example: VG blue circles also give you sound AND plus visual cues now (yellow (?) border line on your screen, just like at Cairn - when you see that, just step aside or dodge), not to mention they always appear in every xx seconds).
---
I'm not exactly sure.
---
According to another thread (1) from 2 years ago an envelope with minimum magic find yielded around ~97s in vendor trash. Assuming this is still correct and the value increases proportional to your luck, getting your money back even without a great deal of account magic find should be possible (Plus you can actually use the luck).
---
After all, the trading post takes a 15% cut, so when selling an envelope for 1.40g you actually only get 1.19g back.
---
Downside is of course that ideally, you would need the gold reserves to either stockpile the envelopes to avoid wasting boosters to repeatedly getting your magic find back up.
---
Haven't tried anything myself yet though.
---
Had 3 reports for spam as the link itself is essentially spam.
---
That is precisely what I needed to know, if it might actually be out of my reach already, so that I wont keep trying and feeling miserable for something that I can't "fix" and stop giving others a hard time while trying haha. Thank you for taking the time to answer :)
---
I'm over 60 so you're not necessarily too old. VG is a horrible beginning raid boss because it -is- pretty difficult. See if you can get in a group doing Cairn (a bit easier), Mursaat Overseer (likely the easiest), or Samarog (much easier than VG).  
---
You don't say what profession you're playing, but I'm going to assume a power melee. That's tough on VG, but one tip I received is that the edges of your screen will turn a color when you're about to be teleported. I believe there's also a sound that increases in volume. If you're not in a set role in your group, you might also consider switching to something like condi Scourge which will allow you to back off from the Guardian a bit (especially if they do greens). Other ranged cond classes I've done are shortbow Renegade and Soulbeast, all with greens and without; the best runs are no-green runs.
---
I do know how you feel, though, because I've given up on trying to become a dependable support Chrono. I just can't get the rotation down and also handle a target that hits back.
---
Gives me the "walking through Queensdale while figuring out what the heck to do" vibe. I love it!
---
Even then, bound staff daredevils have a place in the WvW zerg meta if played well.
---
Pretty much... and heck, in our fractal static we'll still happily take an experienced Daredevil for any t4 as one of our DPS slots.  They are one of the better classes at defiance breaking, and staff has enough cleave to work fine. (Our first DPS is always a power soulbeast with spirits because we run a quickbrand/renegade comp)
---
Ok ok, so I might not be so hopeless after all haha. I've been told about the yellow border line, but unfortunately I am so focused on the skills that I haven't been able to notice those in time to react. And I keep the game volume very low because I'm on discord too. I go druid and it also might have something to do with how much stress I put on myself xD Thank you so much for the advices! ♥
---
Thank you
---
The minimum take is now 88s for the golden boar, but you also get some food and fireworks to sell at tp
---
Yeah, lately sometimes our havoc will run a boonshare rifle deadeye for just this purpose... still does plenty of damage, and its low HP isn't as much of a liability when surrounded by scourges and firebrands, especially at the range rifle has.
---
Sadly, we would be limited with the models skeletons to do anything super different. It's why we don't see much of a difference in base models. So a tiger would be better suited for a jackal reskin, etc. (The raptor arms are just too short, the tiger would have to have short arms too). Wyvern they would really just have to replace the griffon but no idea how buggy that would be. Let's see.. the moa would have to have different shaped legs to fit the bunny, the model animations removed from the beetle-car. Kirin would be interesting, but they would have to make a new skeleton/rig/animation for a head, if they can't stretch out a jackal neck. (But I'm sure you know all of this so it's probably redundant to even say)
---
I would so love these, though, if anet was willing to put that work in to such a project. 
---
Its easier to out-heal mechanics than do enough dps to skip them. 
---
Sure, 10x magi will take a lot of time, but harrier, diviner and seraph builds? The difference to your usual 2x minstrel, 2x harrier druid comp is not that big.
---
Consider a more accessible dodge keybind.  In fact I'd suggest reconsidering all your keybinds.  Good keybinds are almost all different from person to person. 
---
Then I definitely need to practice more, it's much better knowing that my "issue" is fixable hahaha, thanx!!!
---
If you can't clear a raid, you just need to bring more chronos.
---
That might definitely help a lot too, thanx!!!
---
Congratulations! I don't even know if my sweepstake registeration was succesful.
---
I secretly want to see some mysterious force out there(or the forged themselves) take control of the remaining Forged and  have them experiment with their form. Either that or have us find the site where they proto typed what forms the forged would take. 
---
Actually that sounds like an amazing fractal.  
---
Overall ESO shares the design philosophy of GW2 more than any other MMO on the market.  It also does many things better than GW2.  The only thing that is strictly worse is the combat, which feels much cleaner, smoother, and more polished in GW2... and definitely faster paced and more varied by class.
---
i couldnt imagine doing this on a phone, tablet pad maybe. i myself use the desktop pc's onboard video card connected to my 40 inch tv and have navi and wiki open on both, or gw2efficiency when needed.
---
Thank you!!! I promise I will ♥
---
It's a game based on gear grind, which Guild Wars 2 doesn't have, it's based mostly on open world PvP, with very little by way of story, or PvE stuff to do. AFAIK there aren't dynamic events. There weren't in the parts I played anyway. 
---
The game is based around PvP.  I'd have played that game if there was a PVE server, but once you get to a certain level, or move out of the safe areas, you're auto flagged for PvP.
---
You either have to grind like mad to keep up with gear or spend a ton of money to keep up with gear, because unlike Guild Wars 2, if you're running around the open world, you're a target for other players. it's like living in WvW.
---
BDO is a sandbox MMO and Guild Wars 2 is a themepark MMO.  Like I said, very very different types of games.
---
It's just a background scene but you can trigger different states of it and it has interactable objects in it. [More about this  place](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1088029425747312640)
---
I will definitely boost the sound, thanx!!! ♥
---
If you're not getting credit using this method, try switching instances (join a meta squad and switch maps, for example) and doing it again. I did it at least six times to no success, then got it first try after changing instances.
---
Awesome!!! I am feeling most motivated knowing that it's doable and thank you so much for your kindness ♥♥♥
---
okay, okay lol. I get it, sheesh. sorry for the recommendation.
---
I do not know if this is a legit site but I got my HoT and PoF via cdkeys.com. Also buying my gems there. 
---
Sorry, mate. I wasn't trying to nag you, just explain the actual differences. My bad.
---
I want to see how long they will dragon.
---
Star Trek Online
---
I'll have that in mind, thanx!!!
---
Adding some clarification: in regards to gathering from a home instance, your race does not matter. A human can gather from Rata Sum, a Charr can wander over to the Grove, Asura can go visit the Black Citadel, etc. Home instances are a good way to take care of daily gatherer if it happens to be Maguuma, Kryta, Shiverpeaks or Ascalon and you can find someone with a decently full home instance.
---
Considering most meta DPS builds are glass cannon DPS builds, being carried by support builds makes sense.
---
Better get going on that updated build/rotation videos instead of posting on reddit Jaffa 🤣
---
Which region are you on? We have mega servers but are locked to America and Europe for lag/physical server locations. 
---
I'm using the button under the thumb to dodge, it's pretty smooth.
---
Yeah, it felt like a great game but the combat made me quit after a few weeks... Tried it recently again but still can't stand it.
---
That is precisely the one I was thinking about using, thank you!!!♥
---
Sold! Thanks guys!
---
Dungeon armor skins. Not quiet sure what kinda look you are going for but stats wise:
---
Soldier's gear will be available in Ascalonian Catacombs.
---
Berserker's gear will be available in Citadel of Flames, Crucible of Eternity, Arah.
---
Note: each dungeon path drops dungeon currency/tokens at the end of each instances. You can bring a party of 5. There's a daily chest of each path once per day on top of path clears. The merchant to trade in your tokens at Lions Arch. The armors and weapons are exotic gear or orange colored gear better than rare (rare) but one tier below ascended (pink) or legendary (purple).
---
It looks like most people weren't even aware that it was possible to do that back at release, but yes.
---
According to anet it was a bug and I can see why they nerfed it (you could even gain height lol), but it completely destroyed the Griffon for me. 
---
Imho befor that "fix" it was way more responsive.
---
Love it. Great work
---
Short and sweet answers.
---
Don't worry about respeccing. Just try to learn all the skills as with 80 you will have enough to learn all.
---
Don't need the expac to get to 80 (max level)
---
He is literally a dragon dildo
---
Then she has something planned for Saturday anyway
---
With nearly 20 mil luck points it would still take way too long.
---
Yeeeaah! Ranger is awesome! And by the way, numbers aren't that bad with it right now. Right before PoF it was basically a dead DPS class, right now both Power and Condi Soulbeast do over 30k on Golem. By no means a hard carry but can definitely pull it's weight.
---
It almost an insane concept that if you do 30 instead of 20k as disci bs you are basically doing 2k extra on every dps class
---
He was practicing rotatione? What a neet
---
You definitely and desperately need so much love, thank you for reading my post ♥♥♥
---
Thank you, you are right, I need so much more practice :)
---
Disabling skill effects would definitely help a lot, very good idea, thanx :D
---
I'm sold! Your knowledge of lore is impressive and it's a shame this was not a legit gw novel. Enough here to fill several books from various characters perspectives. Wish I had time and the lore knowledge to write something like that. Any who, thanks for your contribution!
---
Hot metas are still quite popular, you can go back!
---
Really nice, I like the way you draw faces. Blog?
---
My mouse has 6 buttons, I need to actually use them now, and I also need to check my skill keys to find a better binding, thank you ♥
---
Wow awesome drawing. If only I knew how to draw^^
---
Yes I still think it applies because players are more likely to do the things in the immediate vicinity rather than run to the furthest part of the map.
---
Though, my point was more about how the game guides you through the world. If you have a questing system in place like WoW or many other MMOs you basically have two locations that you move between, the location where you accept/turn in the quest and the location where you will complete the quest. I can still remember my time in WoW in which you completed all quests in one area and you got another one that guided you to the next.
---
This is different because the only guidance is what you see on your screen, Scouts will show you Hearts on the map but you will still have to find your way to those hearts on your own or you could follow the other part and end up somewhere else.

Of course, the level is not totally to ignore just because of gear and the enemy level but I think it isn't the main objective for you to get to the next level but rather to explore the world on your own terms.
---
Thing I love about being a ranger main is that I can swap to Druid if need be. (though I prefer to stay on SB)
---
Firstly, I thinks there's not all about reflexes. Average human reaction time is about 250 ms, with age it probably can drop to like 500 or even 600, but blue circles hit after 1.5 or 2 seconds after they pop up. But it works with expected events. For unexpected events average reaction time is much more, because your brain gotta make a decision what to do immediately instead of just executing already prepared action, and that time may not fit in those 1.5 sec yet. So, my guess, you just struggle to read those blue circles. I sometimes lead a training raids, and I saw many people with exact same problem. Many people just don't notice a telegraph of that attack, so don't worry, usually just knowing telegraphs and paying attention to those solve the problem.
---
As explained to a few others, I still believe killing berserker first is the better way to learn the fractal as there is less crazy damage to worry about in the last fight ^^ 
---
But yeah for high lv groups there is a split leaning towards the firestorm as you say
---
I was able to do the focus normally, tho maybe that was after they fixed it, (seeing as they patched in a solution at the forge master NPC to unblock people too).
---
For PvE, Staff Daredevil. For WvW/PvP, Longbow Ranger
---
It's a bit weird, but we did choose not to kill her when we could have, and she did seem to understand that Balthazar had gone a bit mad by the end.
---
I doubt they are replacing anyone just yet tho. They tend to float between varying groups each season. (At least s3, pof, then s4 did that...)
---
Could be one of those things where the head was given a lot higher resolution compared to the body, a lot easier if it's separated (You can even kind of notice this where the neck connects to the body).
---
For Path of Fire, I'd recommend Elon Riverlands. On the east side of the map theres a tonne of untouched earth elementals ripe for the picking, after that make your way south and east to trash along the water line and the harpies (which are skipped frquently).
---
Heart of thorns is a bit tricker as the maps is frequently cleared, hunt for ubpopular routes or near areas where the meta has been there yet or has long since moved on.
---
Core: anywhere with water that isnt a heart. Theres a bunch of other spots but thats the general rule.
---
I am a bit younger at 35 but i definitely see a huge difference between my reflexes and 20 year olds. Still i have no issue in playing in good statics in raids. You are definitely not too old. It is just that  you need a bit more practice than the younger people to create the muscle memory you need. 
---
The way you handle the mechanics is to make sure you get used to of doing the rotation as automatically as possible leaving brain space for the mechanics. Also you have to fins way that can work for you. In VG for example you can keep yourself slightly off that the stack and instead of dodging walk out of the blue. Different keybind that are closer to one  hand are also essential. An instant dodge button works as well. For example buy a mouse with a few extra keys and bind dodging  to one of them thus you can dodge instantly  with one push. With a bit of practice you should be fine. 
---
With your setup you should get 60fps constant with model limit low/medium and quality medium even at highscale fights 
---
At least that's for me like this with my rtx2070 and an i86k (graficcards doesn't matter to much here)

If you also have the ability to use DirectX12 then you could use the DirectX9 to 12 Proxy [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ak0mqs/d912pxy_directx12_for_guild_wars_2/). though you should know that this is a very early development and will likely crash the game some times.
---
Another thing would be to use [GW2Hook](https://04348.github.io/Gw2Hook/) to apply shaders to the game.

This is lovely.
---
Kill neutral creatures that have a yellow name. The longer someone lives the more bonus exp they give. Since neutral creatures don't attack directly they tend to not get killed often.
---
Sucks that outfit shoulders cant be disabled 
---
The teleports on vg are indicated by a buzzing sound and a yellow border on the screen. Dodge as soon as you notice either of those.
---
For Warrior it's not specifically about the numbers but more because you have nothing else to do but a DPS rotation (and mechanics like the rest) and drop your banners every 70-90sec. Before you could say that you were trying to focus a bit more on might but now you have nothing else to think about except hit the boss once you dropped the banners. You're "just" a DPS in full DPS gear with 2 mandatory slots.
---

It's possible there's an outfit that looks similar to the mistward top. I don't know a lot of charr fashion looks.

---
Just chiming in to say - pretty much everything others said - that after you level this character and play them more/main them, you won't need to level any other as you will start to get Tomes of Knowledge soon :) Also if you do consider leveling 1-2 toons consider joining Edge of the Mists for easy xp trains (if they still run, I don't know. Haven't been there in 2-3 years but they used to be a thing + use boosters). Or you can even dab into WvW after lvl60 to break the monotony and get XP as well as more Tomes of Knowledge :)
---
HAPPY LEVELING! 
---
Cuddles? That smells like Canach, but I don't remember fully
---
&gt;not much different from collecting 20 bear asses
---
LOTRO will always be a fond memory for me but the bear ass collecting quest will be its legacy.
---
it'll leave me scared stiff
---
~ 600 MF I'm kinda doubting, unless you're comparing with selling on TP instead of directly.
---
[This](https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime) shows you about the average reaction time, 100ms being mostly unreachable by most people. Even 200ms is already pretty fast as youc an see. So definitely not in the &lt;100ms range.
---
Worst part is that the rotation is really fucking easy besides discipline. Half of tactics zerk is auto attacking and on core it doesnt even matter that much. Just finish aa chain, press skills of cooldown at make sure to use kick before axe 5
---

Him? Thought it was a whammen! :O

2k gold profit may seem easy money for some people for "opening a bunch of envelopes" but if you consider that he had to invest around 35k gold up front to buy them, its just a Return of Investment of not even 6%, which is a piss poor ROI, if we are honest.
---
And even with consume all, we have to consider opportunity costs with large sample sizes like this, meaning the time it takes to update buy orders and sell your loot as well. And if you, like OP, want to log your loot for research/community service, it takes a whole lot of time of sorting your inventory. 
---
So in terms of investment strategies, I doubt that OP is doing a 2nd round this year.
---
Its a trap! :o (it’s a human male with the long hair/pretty face preset) 
---
Thankfully he doesn't seem to be heading down that way
---
Specifically for GW2 it would be i5 8400 if you're not going to overclock your setup. With overclocking both should be more or less the same, while Ryzen being vastly superior if you're going to stream or multitask. I would personally go with Ryzen, as it's multi-core capabilities and good OC potential can make a good difference in the long run.
---
It's definitely neither of those. The Mistward chest has a glowing gem in the center, and the mistward pants have big spiky structures over the hips where this just has fabric. 
---
And the weapon is the Forged Staff.

I only got bored with leveling when I decided to speed demon level a bunch of classes at once, way back in LS1 times. So....so much running around a burning LA. I’m so glad you’re having a good time, it’s a wonderful game and I hope you enjoy the real goal of the game: Fashion Wars.
---
How often are they?
---
You honestly can't go wrong with either one. If you are just purely using your rig for gaming, I would say Intel. Most of the time, you'll get a marginally bit more frames. If you do need the processing power video editing or other CPU intensive tasks, I would go with Ryzen. Both chips are more than enough for GW2 I believe though.
---
Have my upvote!
---
When u mentioned multitask, does it include things like opening discord, spotify and such in the background?
---
Would the minimum frame difference between the 2 be noticable in events like, for example WvW and Metas?
---
works fine for me
---
Thank you so much! :D
---
resources allocated to wvw were always more or less limited to the bare minimum. as such, it is unlikely that there is any significant project being worked on while alliances are still unfinished.
---
It won't be noticable. Usually Intel chips for games in general will get like maybe 5 more FPS than Ryzen. Both chips are powerful enough for you to not have a problem running GW2. Personally, the upgrade path for Ryzen is much more appealing since Ryzen motherboards will get support till 2020. This just means that the motherboard you buy can still be used for newer Ryzen processors in the future. 
---
Definitely. Most of the apps running in background like to get some attention from your CPU from time to time: discord when you get mentioned, spotify when it changes song and needs to download and decode it, youtube, netflix or other videos need a lot of resources to decode videos in high quality, if you're watching them on the other screen... and so on. So if you're planning to run a lot of apps in background, Ryzen may be better - but if you're not going to watch movies while having game on, i5 8400 should also be enough.
---
and meanwhile everyone else gets buffs in the same sense that istan chests supposedly did
---
Awesome thanks for the info
---
Thanks for your input.
---
Is not a surprise if Mesmer and Thief gets another nerf those 2 classes are the more nerfed ones .
---
Honsestly i think that their main problems are the precision works, because of their sharp claws.
---
turn off reflections and shadows or at least on low these are the big hitters on cpu
---
Meant selling directly to a certain buyer on gw2exchange who is totally not me VS selling on TP.
---
VG blue definately has more than enough time for anyone imo
---
Here's what I recommend:
---
1. Turn on Limit effect LOD in graphic options to reduce other visual noise
---
2. Turn on Sound. Most mechanics have a distinct sound queue to them
---
3. Look for the yellow warning border around your screen. If you're standing in the teleport circles, that will light it up
---
4. Bind dodge key to something easly accessible, I recommend the middle mouse button
---
5. When you start raiding, focus on mechanics a LOT more than anything else. Compleatly stop eveything else if you need to. Once you have the mechanics down, you can work on improving your rotation and damage output.
---
Hey I think I have a solution for you, maybe? If by dodge key you mean the ‘v’ key, as is default, why don’t you just remap your controls for dodge. In fact you should buy a mouse the has extra buttons—perhaps up to ‘mouse 5’. And map the dodge key to your mouse under your right thumb  or a scroll wheel click or something. Maybe it’d help?
---
How about an Asura with title.."Nani?!" xD

The meme "template" i used had no credits on it. Sorry for that.

Fractals, go with tempest. But getting 2nd spec will only take 1 hour more, so there is real need to choose only 1.

Getting 30 in two weeks and raid commander of a casual guild. I don't think you're too old for this and I can understand you concerns of slow reflexes. Our raid group is mixed from 24 up to 45 and we see in any age: if someone got a vary exhausting day or a horrible energy drain, doing mechanics is affected by that.  
---
As others told here, another key bind is helpful. I work with space key as dodge and e for jumping. I changed it because of the mirage and it helped a lot.  
---
If this is a common concern for not-so-easy bosses, try to communicate with your raiding commander about that, if you got a static group.
---
Besides the armor, he uses the Forged staff. Wonderful weapon skin, looks great on daredevil.
---
You forgot about Caithe mate :)

I didnt mean reaction time being there, I meant the decay in it as people age.
---
I'm in a 30+ guild and we have many members between 50 and 60 and we still raid together. Sure, here and there it isn't first try easy mode, but if you find a group (maybe around your age) it shouldn't be a problem.
---
Keep up the spirit :)

There is still a lot of mystery in Rytlock's arch. There was a time in LW3 that two Adamant Guard escorted him away to the Citadel for questioning. Possibly about the LW2 attempt in Barradin's tomb or something but still it was never clarified what's going on with Rytlock and the High Legions. This momologue now suggests that Rytlock is now much against the legislation of the Citadel. It would be interesting if he turmed into a literal Renegade in both senses. 
---
I wonder how much compassionate did Caithe grow. I expect similar relation to the Commander, a sort of trust in their plans but still Caithe liked to take action into her own hands.
---
Zafirah though, the only connection she has to things on a greater scale is her devotion to Balthazar and it all falling apart. Seemingly the same thing that Kasmeer went through. I mean, can't we have such a blog post of all the characters?
---
And funnily, when Logan became the Pact Marshall, it was said that it would be a desk job. Now I understand that everybody must fight this war against Kralkatorrik, but still. Logan had almost retired by now, surely he has something to say about it. I hooe the writers manage to give attention to all the relevant characters. I'm all in for Zafirah, Gorrik and all but I hope this doesn't mean that they'd replace older characters. We'll see though.
---
Best part is that you don't even have to do the meta for the chests. 
---
TBH every T4 Fractal or Raid build is niche as they are built around very certain mechanics.
---
I see u/srgrafo, I upvote.
---
The thing is that there are many players out there who want to do a dungeon but very few add groups them self and wait for others to do so if people want to change that they gonna have to put up their own group on the lfg-tool with exact info of what path and what you want the group to be like for example All welcome or speed run only lvl 80 or have 600.000 dps and 35 k ap (i guess this guy can solo it) and so on.
---
I think if there is enough interests they may do that. Remember when people kept bothering them about the bunny ears re-release? It took a while but anet gave in and brought it back. Same for the tribal armor that was lost.
---
I am not an ArenaNet developer. So I can't say for sure. But that's the only logical explanation for why they still calculate an empty hash in case of a file being unreadable and why they would have said empty hash in their blacklist, to begin with.

He didn't have a shield if that's what you are trying to remember. But he used the Herald skills which have blue crystal dragon visuals.

\^ i loled but hes right sadly

This is genuinely the first time I have heard this :o
---
can they release another purchasable % dmg modifiers for account, so i can buy power reaper balance if they can't do it themselves?
---
Thank you! :D 
---
it works full-screen, but there is still bugs in focus handling
---
Ah yes now it's at least on par with every other viable ranged power weapon, and the only use is it's 2 skill.
---
Im on R5 2600, 16 gigs of 3000mhz ram, 1070 SC and I'm very pleased at how it runs gw2 or any other game. Even OC'ed it to 4,05 ghz with 1.13v which is amazing and I'll keep playing with it until I find a good spot. Probably cheapest long term love you'll get :D
---
As for GW2 specifically on mostly high settings Fotm 80-150fps, raids 45-100 fps, wvw 40-100 fps. Depending on how many bigbois you have to load. 
---
Still buffed, not saying it is op 
---
I dont understand. What do you mean? XD
---
You might want to:
---
- Upgrade your armor from rare to exotic.
---
- Upgrade your trinkets.
---
- Take a greatsword with berzerker starts, you do not profit from condition damage.
---
- Take a stunbreak to deal with the stuns (blink sound like a solid choice, breaks the stun and gets you some distance for further kiting).
---
I do not know mesmer that well, so I cannot comment on traits. Maybe check out the open world section on https://metabattle.com/wiki/Mesmer
---
but who banged so big?
---
Awesome!! Is it available in gif? 
---
If you do the on-demand (hearts, PoI, vistas, ...) content in a 10 level map, you get around 4 levels.
---
Mirror images and decoy are quite useless, take one of the phantasm utilities (or both, they do high damage AND create clones afterwards anyway). If you have problem with getting CCed a lot get stability mantra or position better. Offhand sword seems a bit useless if you're fighting many mobs, take focus for pull (so you can cleave them with GS skills) or even torch.
---
Not a single aura? Not even a leggy?
---
2/10 do you even endgame? XD
---
REALLY awesome art dude! Gib moar!!!
---
Train your reflexes, make more convenient keybinds, read guides, watch videos, play proper builds and you’ll be raiding like a pro in no time. Raids aren’t as scary as they seem once you know what you’re doing.
---
Heads up, you can reply to a comment itself instead of posting an entirely new comment
---
"I am nerf incarnate!"
---
My suspicion is that they'll add further buffs to Necro scepter because they might have concerns that it still has room to move from disgustingly overpowered to obscenely overpowered.
---
Does someone know when the Balance Patch is comming?
---
Anyone else remember the days when balance patches were exciting? It's become quite the abusive relationship
---
That’s odd - since I thought it was. I’m suspect having nothing traited would hurt my play a lot.
---
Thinking about it I might have swapped it out to check what a Chrono could do and failed to retrait when I swapped it back. That would place it at about the point I perceived a difficulty step up...
---
I mean it works with sylvaries without the infusion and naked
---
And its not a little bit of experience either. Its a good hunk.

---
I'd probably go with Ryzen since I do visual stuff besides gaming and it's a lot cheaper, but games tend to be notoriously bad at utilizing multithreading and you probably end up getting better performance with the Intel CPU, as said in this thread before. I recommend not skimping out on the CPU. I've ran through multiple GPUs but I'm still using a decade old mid-high range Intel processor. GPUs tend to scale into the future and so far you have been able to put newer gen GPUs into older PCI slots, but once the MoBo gen switches, you might not be able to upgrade your CPU without changing the MoBo as well, which is expensive and all sorts of hassle.
---
Also, think there's a new generation of Ryzen coming out late this year.
---
I'm with you, I've got max levels on each class and a few back ups that I just use to get map completion again. Every few weeks one of my friends and I have a race to 80 and a race to map completion.
---
To be honest, balance is generally fine and a-net doesn't seem to be confident with just shaking things for the sake of it. Maybe they'll buff something like scrapper, but not enough to make it relevant, maybe they'll nerf something like a mirage, but not enough to push it away. For me thats a problem, I'd take unbalanced, but dynamic game over the stale one. 
---
And nercomains(tm) will whine either way. 
---
The toughness on Chrono is only if you need it to take tanking mechanics.
---
This is probably your main issue, playing a class where the rotation is too hard to combine with the mechanics.
---
Two ways to go about that -&gt; 1: learn your rotations so you don't have to look at your skill bar anymore -&gt; using the raid training area
---
2: Play a class that doesn't have a rotation and focus on the mechanics, viper scourge = use skills on cooldown for example, snowcrows/metabattle has all the meta builds for raiding go through them and pick a class you like. This also means staying away from support roles until you actually are able to perform well under stress on them.
---
Dueling 1-3-1
---
Illusion 1-2-1
---
Domination 2-2-1
---
this will ensure maximum damage for the traits you selected.
---
for gear, try to get at least all exotic gear. the minimal boon duration increase from traveler rune won't do you any good with just them alone. you're better of with something like rune of vampirism, strength or even ogre. swap cleansing sigil too with strength, force, or impact. if you really need condi cleanse, slot the mantra that does it.
---
for skills, use blink. it's a stunbreak and teleport, so they can't cc chain you. phantasmal disenchanter is good as well for open world. core mesmer don't have much going around for AoE so you'd want to use Focus 4 to pull them together then burst them with GS 4,2 and 3.

Yeah.  Whack an XP booster on, eat some XP food and the levels will fly by using this method.  (If speed is your aim)
---
PvE wise I'd like:
---
* Heavy scrapper buffs of any kind that finally give it identity and a true place somewhere. Function gyro getting a dedicated key, gyros as a whole being less like a very stupid pet and more like an actual gyro.
---
* Several tweaks for condition soulbeast trait wise, it's nothing amazing and hasn't been nothing amazing for quite a while.
---
* A very good, non-meme power revenant build (hah).
---
*Laughs in necro focus 5*. From swiftness to chill ez.
---
They are the same amount of clutter as weapon and armour drops now.
---
One of the fun things about getting random runes is that you get runes you'd never normally use.  Yes I could go on the TP and spend a gold on a major scholar rune or buy a major sigil of force but if they were reintroduced as drops you could use the runes that you wouldn't even know to look for on the TP.
---

Is condi Daredevil still viable for some bosses? Thinking of making a condi set for my Thief but it would suck if i never had a chance to use it.
---
You can use Chaos [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos) with trait [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bountiful\_Disillusionment](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bountiful_Disillusionment) \- a lot of stability and another boons. It's very helpful for the "faceroll" gameplay :D F1-F2-F3-F1 (with illusion [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shatter\_Storm](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shatter_Storm) ) and you become very powerful. I use it when play in open world.
---
It's funny how PvP-driven their rebalancing can sometimes be, considering how tiny a part of the game that is.
---
So, I'm currently playing a Dragonhunter in Fractals, with pugs. I'd like to gear out a more supportive character as an alternative.
---
Considering I have both my guardian and my ranger ready, should I go for a support firebrand or a druid?
---
So, I haven't played since around launch-ish. I did the first Halloween event and then drifted away from the game. I understand there's been a few expansions since then; do I need them? Do people still run vanilla endgame content? (Endgame is fractals, right?) I'm not sure how exactly to get back into the game or what I should be doing. I remember I have at least one max level character, assuming max level hasn't increased. 
---
When is next patch?
---
Hi! I’m thinking about making my first support spec, and I’m thinking about gearing a scourge and a Druid. What would be the best gear to get in both of them for general use? I’ve heard that half shaman and half marshal is good for necro, as it allows them to still do decent Condi damage while also having strong heals. With druid, I heard full harrier is the best. Is this the optimal gear for both specs, or is it something that I can play around with a little more? Thanks!
---
Yes Anet has let off a complete team and didn't tell us or and this may seem crazy perhaps they don't have anything to share with us. I know thats crazy because if a company doesn't update us about anything it must mean its been abandoned. I'm sorry for my crazy theory but I just like to think outside the box.
---
Its not like they will be unplayable, dont get too much on this hate bandwagon related to nerfs, when signet of inspiration was changed for chronos people were complaining and crying, but its still good and the most reliable class for boon share, same as some other classes that got nerfed
---
Elementalist's squeky fire sound on 1st skill, is it a bug or intended. If intended, why not just record a crackling bondfire? The squeking irks me alot
---
It's the supports job?   
---
Is this a thinly veiled attention thread?
---
pretty sure a proper build wont help his reflexes   lol
---
Gw2timer us broken I believe, it is no longer pulling from anet's gem store fourm, you might check out gw2timer's support first as it seems to indicate support is not going to continue.

You can check out [this chart](http://www.nojamtoday.com/upload/guild_wars_2_content_and_feature_update_chart_290.png) for an idea of what has changed (the chart is from before PoF so there has been even more since then). Max level is still 80. Ascended gear was added as a slight improvement over exotics but it's not much stat wise (about 10% increase). Vanilla does not have any raids, Heart of Thorns has raid wings 1-4 while Path of Fire has wings 5 and 6 (and maybe more).  Yes, people still run fractals, many of them run daily clears of the recommended and their tier (mostly T4) and the better players run CM (challenge mote) 99 and 100. Without the expansions you will not have any of the new zones (besides the ones added in season 1 and 2), no gliding, no mounts, no mastery (specifically stuff like auto loot and the fractal mastery), no elite specialization (which can make finding a high level group a little harder depending on profession, limited to core stats on gear, etc. If you do decide to get the expansions they do go on sale often (usually 50%), right now DLGamer has the [combo pack 38% off](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911). I would suggest you get both expansions if you're planning on upgrading.

Except for that you cant? They can chain iframes and blinds for 20s while doing damage. The only classes with enough conditions cleanse are weaver and conversion holo
---
tl;dr opinion: The charms should be drops. 
---
You already have your answer but also resembles Draconic 
---
I disagree, that is like saying ecto should be a drop. 
---
Depends on game mode but you're correct for raid setups on [healing druid](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/druid/healing/) and [support scourge](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/support/). The main reason you're taking harrier on druid is for the boon up time but you could get away with other gear in a double druid group (though I'd still say that harrier is your optimal gear set).

Idk what your referring to

It's still not the stupid ranger SSS+ tier :P. Pew pew from super range with heal, cc, dmg and pet ; P
---
&gt; Condi mirage also has a power damage element that can't be ignored even if you can cleanse everything all the time, which you can't.
---
Yes, but that's true of everything, not a mirage-specific problem. Heal, block, evade or go invulnerable to recover. Oddly, I think the best profession to go up against mirages is another mesmer because of the arcane thievery, so you can just send all those conditions back to where they came from and and watch the mirage one-shot itself. 
---
That's because you only get to see his head and neck in this mission, so why render the rest and slow down performance?

If you are talking about e.g. mechanics add on for arc, that is developed by completely different person and you need to download update from their site. Same goes for any add on for arc that is not maintained by Delta.

Yeah i love to run DD on matthias always for the ecto steal, and would love to play around with condi set (Death Lotus spam looks cool cmon) but yeah i guess its not worth it

To make it funnier I do not even know if this post is about pvp or raid condi dps xD

We get it.

You play chrono and copypaste builds while trying to feel superior to other classes.

---
Epic would be that it transports you to some extremely high point in the map where you could then glide/griphon anywhere you wanted in the map with extreme speed.  
---
It would have to be on a per-character &amp;&amp; per-map basis though.  There was an odd item from the BL chests (iirc) that kinda did this: a portal scroll to the Bitterfrost overlook.

All should be in [WOOD] guild tho.

Id like a guide on the most profitable way to use my 4 alts. Currently they all sit at malchors leap since I'm able to log in a few times during work that's about 5-6g per day. Keep in mind total time playing is only about 30 mins for that gold.
---
If anybody can help me beat this afk / low effort build then I have many internet hugs for you. 
---
It's really sad that Anet abandoned WvE because it's the only unique thing about their game. No one else currently offers RvR aside from ESO but that game is such dogshit I don't count it.
---
But sure, Anet, go ahead with your medicore tumblr-fanfic quality story that you keep pumping out. Squander the only thing that makes GW2 unique in favor of contrived, half-assed fluff content.
---
It bums me out. WvW could have been amazing, but all we ever got was "decent".
---
I thought they were because of their followers. @Anet, @GW2, and multiple employees. 
---
Thank you! I will make some research and let you know!
---
I logged on the my Engineer for the first time in forever and I noticed he has a full set of gear with the (PvP) tag. It’s exotic, but I can’t equip or sell any of it. I think I tried PvP once years ago but I was more focused on story and exploring back then. Is the gear supposed to stay with you?
---
Also, is the flamethrower buffed by Power? Or did I accidentally choose an OP spec combination, because right after boosting him I went to Verdant Brink just for shits and giggles, but I was unstoppable. That area’s been giving me trouble on multiple characters, but I was soloing group content with my Engi.
---
Yes, you can easily gain enough levels by jumping around and doing the other level appropriate maps. But this once again plays into what I was talking about earlier: this will limit the way you can play your game.
---
You want freedom in your game: use the lvl 80 boost or play ESO. Otherwise you are going to be stuck following some pretty straightforward paths.
---
GW2 would be a fantastic game of exploration if it didn't have levels. But since players wanted the level grind, we also gave up on some of its freedom.
---
yes... agreeing totally, i do miss the part where bosses were pushed to the corner so their projectiles could be mitigated or freeze, immobilize boss in position so they can't run away. With the new float, I just can't imagine what gorseval be like in midair hahah
---
often used, in fact, during the weekend, I will be on so u can add me up if server NA. 
---
ign: carrot shank
---
I just loved the way how he tested things and explained them. He had a way of  bringing up new builds in a manner that I haven't found in another Youtuber.  
---
He never appeared to be an elitist snob, unlike many other 'established' people in the community.
---
It's too bad that he didn't pick up other games, I would love to see him tackle those.
---
If Mirage actually was a condi DPS and not a Condi/Power/Tank monstrum that's absurdly hard to beat even if the player is just spamming random buttons, that'd be fine. 
---
Most of Mirages skills have a pretty decent base damage even on condi builds, and considering evasion chaining makes mirage nigh unburstable if the player isn't afk, the very concept of Condi DPS (evade condi AoEs and burst them or get rekt by ticking damage) simply doesn't apply. Condi Scourge has decent sustain and AoE, but no mobility and no burst without preparation. You can likely burst a scourge down if you hit him with enough CC. Mirage has no matter your build 3 or more stunbreaks, insane mobility and evasionspam/target breaks out the ass, making it nigh impossible to burst one down. On top of that Mirage unlike most other condi classes doesn't rely on AoE or freerange skills but mostly on autotarget low cast time low cooldown abilities. 
---
If Mirage actually got a specialization on Condi DPS like Condi Engi or Condi Scourge, where the aforementioned concept applied, it'd be fine. But currently it's doing everything at once.
---
i kno i kno hahah but still good times :)
---
They have frost bow, which is 1200 range, so qualifies as a longbow. Shortbow (900 range) isn't an elementalist weapon yet.  
---
Due to conjured weapons ele has a bunch of weapon options (axe, longbow, shield, greatsword) that ANET would have trouble with making full fledged weapons *because* they exist as conjures.
---
obv it's not the right choice, but u see people do it anyway which is prolly how his donations were bought
---
buy them on the TP, level crafting, there's a couple of karma vendors in orr that sell exotic lvl 80 armor, dungeon vendors, wvw vendors
---
i recommend using the wiki for additional info
---
the main change was that the amount of volatile magic was drastically reduced (*to* ~1/3 as per wiki).
---
Does medium get something other than trench coats without the gem store?
---
if you have Path of Fire - just doing the story puts you more than halfway through the collection for an ascended backpack.  
---
Other people mentioned classes, but I think playing with a gamepad/controller will help you out a lot more because you're moving less fingers compared to keyboard/mouse. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/708eoz/how_to_play_gw2_with_gamepad_do_you_want_a_guide/dn35vgy/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=u_crankpatate) is a written guide not by me on how to setup the controller. If you have a steam controller, [here](steam://controllerconfig/guild%20wars%202/1239244776) is the link by the same person with the configuration. I hope that you can enjoy the game like we do soon!

Arenanet: Say no more. *Nerfs reaper again*
---
The game is long (with exploration and such). Don't worry about gear beyond 80 exotics unless you want to do fractals, then you can try to get ascended armor.
---
Exotic 80 gear should run you both more than 10g for a set, maybe 20 with accessories etc. I would think that's doable pretty quickly just with dailies.
---
If you're not enjoying your character and you delete and reroll, then it doesn't seem like you gave us enough info to see what the problem is. My advice is roll a warrior, learn how to melee and telegraph all the attacks and even open world becomes more enjoyable. But ive only ever played a warrior so my advice is skewed.
---
Plus condi necro "philosophy" is still probably the only class where you can kill yourself mega-easy by trying to kill something :( (as in the conditions you apply to yourself is way more effective than on actual enemy and if you goof with sequence you'll just die) 
---
The new system is great for maxed characters (most people) but worse for people levelling.
---
OP's solution is one possible soluion but thre might be some other good options. Giving runes/sigils back on salvage would be a step backwards.
---
ArenaNet could also add an option (either in the options menu or on kits themselves) that makes upgrades not automatically be salvaged.
---
Reading the comments here, I think a checkbox to salvage runes on the confirmation prompt for "salvage all" would make the most people happy.
---

---
I mean...scepter was trash outside of confusing images for a long time. It's nice its finally usable.
---
Can Stellar weapons be salvaged? 
---
Honestly you are better off buying Monster hunter world. Most mmo aren’t great. Gw2 is better then the rest. 
---
Curious: What's in the meta now that makes Sentinel stuff so expensive on the TP?
---
Yep, but they give a regular vision crystal back, not an irradiated one.
---
Doesn't necessarily have to be mob drop tables, could be for opening chests at the end of jumping puzzles etc, completing dynamic events, heart vendor/karma merchants and world bosses.
---
Yes. That's how they work on all armor classes. That's why rangers don't get pants without trenchcoats very often, they have a very different rigging system than light armor, and costumes are different than all of them. 
---
It's like saying that a size 6 shirt won't fit on a bodybuilders frame, and you're asking if the designer can't just design the shirt to fit them. No, that's not how sizes work. 
---
How to healbot or how to boonbot
---
Just like undead things in RE, GW2's "esports" is very _very_ hard to kill. It keeps jump-scaring by nuking random stuff and lowering your enjoyment of PvE content :( 
---
(and those new instabilities in fractal that clearly were never tested on real pugs, fuuuuu.... :( )
---
Definitely; buying sigils/runes from vendors for karma seemed like the best idea to me as wlel.
---
Use this website here https://benzhaomin.github.io/bdiefinder/  
---
It'll help you find the RAM that has the good samsung b-die RAM that helps with timings and such. Look up the ram you chose here, and see if it has it!  
---
It was a rhetorical question. There is an overwhelming amount of trench coats and it's very hard to find something I find satisfactory for an engineer :(
---
Tried using that but for some reason the dyes look very washed out 
---
It def feels different but maybe im crazy. The first 2 feel much closer together than the 3rd (or 3rd and 4th if you're doing mid strat and count the first one that goes nowhere on side)
---
Its seems so gnarly because people used to expect balance patches to balance and not smiter's boon things into oblivion. Anet can tweak a lot of things, but they can't stop bad players from choosing to dodge auto's over burst, or spamming buttons with confusion on them.
---

What are the character level ranges for Gold and Platinum Doubloons? 
---
Engineer. I'm a fan of super heroes that don't necessarily have a "super power", but can still contribute to the overall success of the group just because they possess a unique skill set. 
---
I’d personally start by re-learning your old characters - they very well may have new builds and/or abilities that will make you fall in love with them all over again. 
---
For me when I returned after 4 years away it was Power Necro - with Reaper in the mix now, I can finally play her as the unkillable Minion Master I always wanted at launch, but was never quite able to achieve. 
---
If after tweaking and re-learning, you still have your eye on a different class, remember that both the PoF and HoT Expansions come with free Instant Level 80 tokens, and the gear you get with them is totally viable for all OW content.
---
Welcome back!!  :)
---
Actually have skipped that a few days on accident :P
---
I've played a fair bit of both and I prefer the Tempest over the Weaver. I play mostly solo stuff right now and I find the Tempest more suited to that type of gameplay. Huge AoE damage with Fresh Air - Air Overloads and Glyph of Storms. Great defense and utility as well.
---
The Weaver will melt things insanely fast once you get rolling and comfortable with it, but if you get caught without cooldowns you're toast. 
---
I'd say learn both, obviously, but start off with the Tempest and then use that to unlock the Weaver. 
---
Tempest is great for solo play and I also like to solo roam with it in WvW.
---
Weaver is the group content king of DPS and likes to have good support from other players to keep it going. 
---
This is my $0.02 and I'm sure it will be subject to debate.
---
And then there's the warrior nerfs every patch
---
Those were always expensive because they are required for guild hall upgrades I believe. 
---
The collections for [Eclipse](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guide_to_Greater_Understanding) and [Scion's Claw](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Healing_Heir) are fairly easy and will get you stat selectable exotic greatsword and sword, but you need to have your crafting high enough be able to craft vision crystals.
---
[Bandit Weapon Specialist](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bandit_Weapons_Specialist) is only 19 rare skins obtainable as loot or crafting and will get you a 20 slot bag and unlock a few (albeit fairly standard) skins in the process.
---
Uncanny Canner will get you a second bag.
---
Tip of the spear is only 16 rare skins to buy/unlock and will get you a path of fire named exotic that can be used to start the PoF specialization collection to get an ascended dagger if you go soulbeast.
---
The only thing mirages get that even gets them close to tanky is maintaining protection via staff. And that's the most passive, least burst weapon them have. Scepter has short duration on everything, making it the most aggressive weapon. Axe has moderate duration/ high application but is reliant of offhand for safety and wants to kite since you can't trade blows in melee unless you want to get melted.
---
*flies away in the mists*
---
I'm just getting back into the game, havent played since pretty much release. Leveling a mesmer now and would like to focus on pve, dungeons and raids. Any suggestions on what build would be best and also where I should start to catch up on current content?
---
that does suck... i hope they should allow certain collections to craft doubles..
---
Mesmer will never die, and every time you think it’s dead it’s just ANOTHER FUCKING CLONE.
---
How the fuck does anyone even beat spell breaker? Fighting a spell breaker already feels like fighting a truck. I would rather fight a scourge or a mirage any day than fighting a spell breaker.
---
This hurts the most.
---
But there are alot of Nerf Warrior topics lately, so a warrior nerf is not so farfetched.
---
If you're not going to go for a full home instance, not really. If you ever need a couple of extra LS4 materials if I were you I'd just open a party in the LFG-parties asking for a full home instane or leeching off a friend or guildmate.
---
Maybe it just has a big head.
---
If it helps the blue circles happen about every 7 or 9 seconds. I used to do mental countdowns when starting since I couldn't dodge in time
---
I will discus this with my raid party and let you know. For now we are doing combination Renegade+Firebrand for boons and Druid for heals. 
---
&gt; this will limit the way you can play your game.
---
How does an increase in options limit the way you play your game?
---
You have 5 maps for level 15 and under. To reach level 15 **by only map completion**, you must choose any 1.5 of those maps.
---
This literally means you have 24 possibilities, if you're **self-limiting** with just doing map completion alone.
---
This, naturally, is excluding leveling via doing events (~300 unique events), 4 world bosses, level 10 personal story, crafting, or jumping puzzles (7 total in those 5 maps), and is literally just the first 15 levels of the game.
---
Once you get to level 15-25, you're adding:
---
1. 4 new maps (7.5 maps for 15-25 levels when doing nothing but map completion).
---
2. Chapter 2 of personal story.
---
3. Even more jumping puzzles (+4) and mini-dungeons (+1) in said maps.
---
4. Even more events (~240) in said maps.
---
5. Rollerbeetle racing (4) (available to non-PoF no-level-80s players via cheap rental).
---
And by the time you get to the next set of maps (25-35), you're exponentially greater in options.
---
You don't have to be level 80 to avoid straightforward paths. I'd say you're full of bullshit, but you're lacking the bull.
---
We could compile yet another complete list of all the things that they have the clear possibility to resolve in all the areas of wvw, given the efficiency shown on the pve ones of the same nature; but knowing the priority level shown already on it from them in this years it's evident that it would represent only the yet another ignored act, regardless of the benefits.
---

---
During Scarlet's Secret Room, Mordremoth's name is mentioned for the very first time (in in-game lore/storytelling). However, it is implied that the name is already well known to both the player and their companions. 
---
The issue was recognized and addressed by Bobby Stein on the official forums: "(...) the player character's knowledge of Mordremoth and how that fits into the story. For some players, this may have felt like it came out of nowhere". The possibility for a future fix has been vaguely mentioned, though not confirmed
---
I've leveled 10 of my 12 characters to level 80 and not once did I worry about what runes I put in the armor.  When you don't even have all of your traits  or skills unlocked, those littel but of boost you get from runes is insignificant.  Just put in whatever upgrade you have and run with it.  Don't overthink this.
---
Many of the fractal ones are actually very easy to get and can be done on T1, meaning you don’t even need agony resistance. Eg: Don’t trip in swampland, /bow after boss in cliffside, don’t die in underground mid boss fight. Just look them up on the wiki.
---
Protection implies you're actually hitting the real thing for real damage. What makes mirage soak up damage isnt their ability to face tank but the constant damage negation by redirecting it to their Clones and distortion/evasion. 
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again-knowing how to beat HoT mobs is the mark of a truly good player.  Figuring out how to get through those maps without getting bodied felt like a true achievement.  PoF just didn't have that, sadly.
---
Sadly that's just how most software development works, when you don't have someone really competent in charge. Or even if you do, people further up the chain can ruin everything. Features creep into releases where they don't belong, looming deadlines force you to cut corners to make the release date, and then when it's finally out there, instead of taking time to go back and fix things, you're immediately piled on with more new development, and told that it is top priority. If managers / stakeholders don't see the value of cleaning up bugs, developers will mostly not even be allowed to do it, as any unsolicited changes to the codebase means more work for QA that was not planned (in theory anyway).
---
I'm just glad I don't work in an industry where people come online and shit all over my work when they have no concept of what the actual problem is. Or, hell maybe they do; I'm just not expected to ever interact with them, much less be friendly and welcoming of their ignorant critiques and conspiracy theories.
---
T4s without ascended armor and infusions? Not a great idea
---
Actually VG is excellent starting boss. It is one of the more difficult and mechanically heavy bosses - and that's wonderful! Because it creates the right mindset about raids. Embracing the cycle of "fail - figure out what's wrong - fail some more" is the best thing you can learn about raids.
---
Please anet, give some love to weaver
---
In my opinion its only a lack on quantity, when we talk about skin rewards for playing them game. the quality of the release in game rewards is awesome; legendary armor and weapons, astral weapons, headhunter armor; just to mention a few.   
---
But of course you are right, when talking about gear trademill, without this its very hard for an mmo to keep players entertained.  
---
But as many players before said, offering outfits as seperate armor parts in the gemstore would likely give them even more money, because many players; inculding myself, are not buying any outfits, because i want to customize my character, if all the outfits were armor parts, then I would buy so many of them.  
---
So, I dont see how this can only be a money feature, but maybe i underestimate the buying power of outfit hypers :D  
---
UI can be done in the last step.  
---
At least now I would like to know  
---
the status of the backend code  
---
and if it was tested.
---
Yeah, though it's not as bad in most places Orr is completely fucked, if it's not part of the "main" events there's like 70% chance it will completely lag out and eg. spawn npcs you have to revive under the map. And even for main events, if it's not a single NPC escort there's high chance it will break because part of the group blocks it.
---
My favourite so far though is the one where the event escort npc just decided to stand there after someone started the event. 
---
He ran out of content. 
---
Nope. You bought garbage and got scammed. 
---
A drake would make more sense. Dragons wouldn't really work in a Canon sense, surely? 
---
Very nice! The only problem is that now I want to Gate of Babylon people with illusionary swords, and that probably isn't going to be a thing any time soon.

Condition mirage is such a carry. 
---
Anet nerf on mirage: "we updated certain skills description to match their purpose."
---
Anet nerf on chrono and base mesmer: "weve reduced boon duration and amount of boons chrono applies to themselves per shatter, they will only apply swiftness now. We have increased cool down times on wells. Wells no longer apply boons. This effect is for wvw and pvp only (wells are useless in wvw) we have also increased cooldown time for shield skills and all elites by 30 seconds. We want to ensure that chronomancers usefulness is limited to veils, occasional portals and focus pulls only in wvw. weve reduced the damage per illusion shatter by 55% and increased cooldowns on either feast by 15 seconds and healing is reduced by 80% per illusion summomed. " 
---
Anet nerf on necromancer: we've reduced dhuumfires damage to 1 stack of burning for .05second and reduced the damage by 75%. Weve reduced all reaper shroud ability damage by 45% and increased cooldowns by 8 seconds. Weve increased cooldowns of on every elite skill by 1 minute. Weve reduced cooldown of spectral wall by .03 seconds in pve only."
---
Antes nerf of thief: "weve increased revealed time by 3 seconds and reduced all stealth skills duration by 10% respectively. Increased the CD of backstab by 8 seconds per hit." 
---
What a twist.
---
Eh, I don't find the link just now, but I saw a study that around age 40 many people *think* they lose their reflexes and they do without training, but they still can train them and get good again. Not 16-on-caffeine reflexes, but good.
---
So, don't think you are *too slow* or whatever, but that you are *untrained* (just like the guy above said).
---
I am 40 myself, going 41 next month, and yesterday I started doing fracs again after not playing them for at least a year, maybe two. I played well into L70. Yesterday I played L5 and L10 and I *SUCKED*. Badly. Well, I managed not to get downed and did some DPS, but I *sucked*. 
---
So, get in the game, maybe find easier raids and go for it :)
---
The amount of edgelord chronos on reddit is fairly high
---
Thieves right before PoF: wow, deadeye is going to be awesome! Finally we will be able to hit ranged, but it seems fair because we can't move at all!
---
Anet: we'll give soulbeasts range AND being able to move.
---
I know someone will mention the days before the Nerf when deadeyes were stupidly op, but now they're nerfed and still can't move.
---
This this this!!!!! I raid once a week with a group of friends. We are not the best and we get frustrated on occasion, but it avoids the toxicity you get in some groups. For me yes it's nice to clear as much as you can but having fun and not getting stressed is miles more important.
---
Also 38 and play druid main and hell yeah it's miles more demanding than some other classes and you screwing up often causes a group wipe (something I still feel guilty about) but if you enjoy it stick with it because it's rewarding when you realise you have really helped the group achieve a kill. 
---
This comes up quite frequently but we've seen that Anet doesn't care. There are events that are bugged from the game's beginning and haven't got fixed yet, and very likely will never be fixed. If anything, newer zones will have similar bugs.
---
Its one of the reasons why i dont play my ranger anymore 😫
---
:)))
---
I can beat SB as condi thief, but it takes minutes dancing around until the fuckers fall, and if you get cc'ed once you're dead. But it's possible.
---
I mean, they did buff scepter last patch, which was nice. But yes, I agree they should buff us more in general. 
---
also you need to completely regear your chrono
---
You could, kind of, for a time. There was that bug with legendary sword projectiles. :P
---
Clipping is just going to be a fact of life when you have a huge diversity of equipment and skeleton shapes. You either need to devote an insane amount of time to fixing every case of it (expensive, time consuming), or you spend development resources on bandaid fixes like this. Or you do nothing.
---
What I don't really get is why outfits can't be sold as a pack of armor skins, which would leave everyone happy.
---
Banners and Spirits will continue to be overpowered in PvE for another 6 years.
---
I swear, if they nerf Warrior in PvE without nerfing Banners I'm outta here.
---
Oh ok, takes up too much inventory, but I might keep the chest piece because I am that idiot who keeps items he can’t use only because they don’t exist anymore.
---
And ok, I know it does both but since I’m still using the basic Soldier armor you get from the boost, I was wondering if it was mostly effected by power, if I’m criting like crazy since I’m pooping out mines and health kits every 2 seconds, or are Mordrem actually weak to fire? Because only other skill I’ve used that does anywhere near the dmg of the flamethrower is the upgraded Mesmer GS skill that hits the target, causes Vulnerability, and then spawns two angry illusions.
---
This is false.
---
I'm 39 myself and have successfully raided for years.
---
I don't raid as much now, taking a break atm. 
---
Necro isn't bad. Complaining about necro being bad is a meme.
---
Since when can mesmers use Rho Aias D:
---
The ~~spirographs~~ [gates](https://www.homestuck.com/story/1606) maybe?
---
I stopped thinking people can be too old for raids when I saw a 66yo lady outdamaging 90% of players on FA Staff Ele (back when it was meta everywhere).
---
The quality is most likely due that this is a multiboxed client and he runs several accounts on the same TD meta
---
Or rifle. Would be badass ro have arcane rifleman with elemental bullets
---
since they can use The Hand to erase space
---
I'm trying
---
oof
---
thank
---
Mirage PvE DPS has been silly for a while now. However, Chronomancer support has been sillier for even longer. Mesmer isn't a profession that sees many meaningful nerfs in PvE. When a nerf does happen, like with Mirage Axe and the change to Torment, the Mesmer players tend to get incredibly up in arms and fixes are issued within days.
---
Meanwhile I'm over here on Thief remembering the months it took after the Deadeye rework to not leave the profession in a pretty useless state. 
---
No, most likely not. I'm glad I haven't noticed that.
---
I'd rather you think of that than the truth which is I'm too lazy to draw the various wells and such mesmers use
---
That's really the meta-narrative here. The Mesmer code has grown sentient and is now actively evading Anet.
---
personally I want mesmers that use warhorns so we can FINALLY have a Bard class
---
with 150 base MF; is it worth to open or sell them to TP?
---
"Boonshare" it only lengthens applied boons, instead of shared boons applied. 
---
Unfortunately, this would never be possible since it would break other modes where Tempest is already good and Anet would never split balance something this huge. 
---
I was planning on using both builds for open world/fractals since I haven’t gotten into raiding yet. Would that gear still be optimal for both? I was thinking about running sceptor/dagger + torch for more Condi damage on necro, and the suggested weapons for Druid. 
---
Haven't seen anyone mention this, but swap off the Traveler Runes.
---
They're giving you *basically* 0 combat stats. Look for some that give Power, Precision, or Ferocity.
---
Also, the Signet Heal fully recharges Phantasm skills (GS4, Sword 5). Because of this, you can abuse an opener that will basically kill any normal/Veteran mobs.
---
Mantra of Pain (12 Might) + Sword 5 (8 Might) - Swap - GS4 + Signet Heal + GS4 + GS2 + GS3
---
Fractal God.
---
I've been looking forward to another of these ever since doing it for the first time last month 
---
Gotcha
---
i cant buy named exotic weapons and armor, it says i have to wait 4 days, the thing is that i made the account sunday and it has told me to wait 4 days for multiple days now. anyone know what is wrong? do i have to contact support about it? i have both expansions if that matters
---
Give revenants a source of quickness so I can replace chronos pls!
---
Fixing it would mean either a complete redo of armors of the game, or clipping issues. 
---
Its better to bend than to break
---
I'm having trouble finding the support page right now, but if they aren't going to support it anymore then I'll need an alternative anyway which is what I'm looking for...
---
That comment seem to have any examples whatsoever though. 
---
Hey, I'm only casual, but why do you say reaper is low dps? Pve wise (open world, fractals) he's deleting mobs incredibly fast.
---
Mirror images is a stun break and has some uses if you shatter a lot, but the two phanatsms are definitly better than decoy and MI.
---
Same thing happened to me last night. I went directly to the farms after talking to Gorrik.
---
They called it a buff.
---
I despise mesmers at this point. They are the pure love child, but I hate their play style... but its always so tempting to play one just because if how God damn useful they are
---
I think Anet is trying to find a way to deal with the BlackGate problem where guilds started trying to game the system using WvW guilds. BG had the largest group of WvW guilds and generally had no problem staying ahead of the other servers. WvW guilds on other servers got tired of being constantly outnumbered by larger and better organized guilds from BG. So they started migrating to smaller servers where they could fight easier opponents.  In other words, WvW guilds kept screwing over random servers and servers with large PVE populations kept being pushed up to fight BG despite having small WvW populations.   
---
I've heard somewhere that timer is bugged and always shows 4 days until it runs out after actual 4 days. Check again later today or tomorrow. 
---
Also don't forget the free envelope(s) in the Guild Hall if your Guild has a high enough level
---
Lol. Thief. Pew pew
---
I understand
---
wheres the part where a scourge comes in and shadebombs them
---
Theif spec with a one handed/off hand weapon. It's unfortunate that the specs available to theif both add two handed weapons. There's no new dual wielding combos. Both are mostly power focused too. A brigand/marauder spec with offhand torch would be neat. 
---
He probably uses gw2launcher now that launch buddy is dead
---
Balance in PvE doesn't matter that much, as you can do all PvE content on any class. Nothing is really hard enough to require a certain class. 
---
Only issue is what the community accepts, and that will always be an issue no matter the balance.
---
The program is called Launchbuddy and is greenlit by anet. If u plan to multibox make sure to read the policies on the forums otherwise you may be subject to suspensions like other offences.
---
Staff eles and tempests will let you eat your lunch at their table.
---
Gw2launchbuddy is the name I hear being thrown around. For as far as I know you're allowed to us it, but you aren't allowed to use more than one of those with the same input, if that makes sense. If you press forward on one of your accounts, the input isn't allowed to be used on a second account.
---
I was making some research - I found one place with iron ore and seasoned wood - It takes 4 minutes to make round around with one alt and it will get you min 60s. 
---
Or you can park at the end of jumping puzzles. But profit depends on loot.
---
Another tip is farming flax seeds - they are little bit more expensive than elder wood.
---
And the last one is  leaving alt at the Tomb of Primeval Kings in Desert Highlands - there are small chests you can loot.
---
31st of Feburary.
---
I wasnt entirely wrong then! 
---
Studies have shown that reaction time doesn’t actually vary that much from ages 20-50. It’s really more a matter of practice to train your reflexes, and older people typically play a lot less than people who are younger and practice less. In essence, you think as young as you feel. 
---
think how awesome fashion wars would be if they made it work
---
Just please give electronic a strong and FUN PvP build. Haven't had one since D/D cele ele.
---
Haven't bothered to calculate it yet, but guesstimating like 1.46ish maybe. Though that's return per envelope, not profit.
---
was he having a stroke when he wrote it
---
Thank you :D not the best one but always fun to get something out of the ordinary, especially from a end chest like that, when u least expect it.
---
Hello, you can check ytb there are already many videos explaining (for example from CommonTale). If you couldn't find what you need let me know.
---
Regear chrono is the new purity of purpose.
---
Sounds fair
---
Hello, you can check [www.snowcrows.com](https://www.snowcrows.com) there are builds with rotations for support Herald and Renegade and for Firebrand.
---

---
Elementalist already has the most limited range of weapons to choose from. Out of all weapons to get for an elite specialization, why would anyone want a duplicated weapon of their conjure weapon? The beauty of a conjure weapon is to create something you do not have. And no, a dev has not confirmed that they are intentionally avoiding conjure weapon duplicates, but it logically makes sense and there hasn't been a duplicate so far. I also do not think we will get many more sets of elite specs (I wouldn't be surprised if we only got 1 more set of elite specs ever) unless they get creative with warrior elite spec weapons. So with this in mind, the Elementalist will have enough options if they never duplicate a conjure weapon. In my opinion, my rationale is more of "critical thinking" than "narrow-mindedness."
---
They do
---
I want to be like her when I grow up!!! hahaha that's awesome, thank you for the example :D
---
Reaper isn’t top tier in fractals, but is way more survivable than other DPS due to the reaper form acting as a secondary health bar and panic button (which if you’re using it as one, then you’re lowering your DPS because your rotation is messed up). The class is all around great and can play every mode competitively, just not top tier at any except open world where top DPS isn’t needed and survivability is useful.
---
Good for you!!! keep the positivity going ♥
---
&gt; Even though the balance shifted since then, the mentality of players are mostly the same.
---
He was wrong about how the game worked then, we all pointed it out, and history has proven us right. All his insults towards us about all our "spreadsheet numbers" were totally invalidated once DPS meters and the DPS golem were introduced showing that, in fact, people who urged people to run good builds were correct.
---
&gt; Alas, getting flamed while providing community service isn't fun and I guess he saw that he couldn't change it all by himself.
---
He was the one flaming, with the object of getting attention. His videos called *me* out. He was the one making videos bashing Snow Crows. Neither my guild, nor anyone else in the speed clear scene EVER made a video bashing him or calling him out by name. But he made plenty about us. So who was the victim?
---
I agree with you, sometimes I feel like I got it but others I feel like... you know haha. Thanx!!! :)
---
that'll be done when someone pays me to do it or another video
---
If they would just change applied force to apply its quickness in AOE then revert the change to the elixer that used to grant quickness then medi scrapper would be amazing.
---
very good idea with the phone, thanx!!! :D
---
I'm 41 also, and while I'm not in the tippy-top raiding elite, I feel like I do pretty well in my pretty good statics. I, too, am aware of some reflex degradation over the years. The thing that stands out to me about the intersection of this issue and raiding in GW is that most mechanics seem to be a matter of anticipation and sometimes of reaction, but almost nothing really requires a fast-twitch reaction. You cite the blue circles at VG, which a lot of people struggle with (me too sometimes), but those circles are sitting on the ground for like ages before they go off. When I get ported, it almost always not because I wasn't able to react; I have plenty of time for that. It's because I was too wrapped up in something else (like my dps rotation or whatever) to recognize that the mechanic had begun, and that I needed to move myself (usually not that far!).
---
So I know what you're talking about with regard to reflexes, and I know that for example, I am never going to be a high-level PvP player because of this. But the things you have to react to in raiding mostly seem to be a recognize-react cycle that is much slower than reflexes. If you think about solving these problems by better anticipating what is about to happen, and reacting while there is plenty of time to do so, you'll have more success and probably just really be playing better!  Best of luck.
---
IDK about weaver but it would be amazing if they buffed the duration of the trait that gives a damage bonus on overload and made it apply to nearby allies as well. 
---
(just make it so it cannot stack with frost spirit)
---
Then support ele would be nice.
---
Yeah I'm super interested in seeing where the story takes me. Makes me want to keep playing. Sadly I stream the game so I can't play my main in my down time. Maybe I'll make an offline alt LOL
---
I think we will deal with primordus and jormag before we go to cantha
---
Due to backlash from Asian players, NCSoft told Anet that they can't put in Cantha.  Anet is allowed to make a lot of decisions on their own, but still has to listen to daddy owner on key issues.  This is the main reason why there no Cantha area in Divinity Reach.
---

That's just the WvW zerg detection system at work.
---
Rythm is key, you are right, thanx :)
---
Thank you :D
---
My axe is ready!
---
That has been debunked by ArenaNet multiple times since release. People ASSUMED it was the case, but that doesn't mean it was.
---
hahahaha let me know if you find such a thing and I'll goo too, please :D
---
Its not possible to out heal every mechanic(proof in tpots stream) but it is possible for dps player to sustain through mechanics without support if you have appropriate build and class as dps. :)
---
Great, thank you and /u/Gulbasaur
---
Ooh :( That's very much how I feel many times and that is my case about gaming as well. I started playing when I was 33 and it was a game not as sophisticated as gw2. If playing solo makes you happy it's ok to stay like that. But I really wish you give yourself the chance to find the right people so that you can enjoy more of what gw2 has to offer. We have to try not being so hard on ourselves, and I know it's much easier to say it than doing it, but little steps and little accomplishments can do a lot, I promise. Thank you so much for making me feel I am not alone in this ♥  
---
This doesnt happen. You get chrono if you need one and there is a virtual limit set to how many one has even in pug groups. 
---
*most. Im talking about all. All dps builds can clear each and every raid without dedicated support but pure support raid group cannot clear every raid.
---
this is the dumbest i have ever read !!! ,,,,?
---
Wow that's retarded. If everyone would be salty like that we wouldnt have norn because scandinavians would be pissed we wouldnt have the withcer universe and so and so on.
---
the best part about the leveling is that you can skip it with tomes of knowledge and leveling cheap crafting
---
I've been out of the game for a bit, is Mirage OP now?
---
Cool as this could be, this would be a *massive* undertaking for the ArenaNet teams, so I don't think it would ever happen. 
---
That's a lot of new art, balance, and other design challenges.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **7th Cakeday** sariaru! ^(hug)
---
Gw1 already had a dual class system, you had your main class and could use whichever of the rest classes as your secondary, with all their skills and stats (except the core stat of each class). 
---
They are just too lazy to add this system, or from other point, "the current classes are an evolution of the gw1 ones" 
---
Well, the thing is eastern culture is vastly different from western, and based on historical issues and such, Japan and China reeeeeeeally dislike each other. In a way that is quite foreign to most of the west (the closest would probably be like England and Scotland (or France) back in the days)
---
this boy out here spreading lies what a fucking clown haha
---
Yes. *Usable. 
---
Couldn't have say it better, that is exactly how I feel and that's what brought me to post here. I needed to know if I can fix it or if I should just quit this kind of content. But, as you can see, there are many things we can do to get better and be able to enjoy the harder fights. We already gave the first step acknowledging our flaws, so let's keep on trying with all the help we are getting in this post. We can do it!!! ♥♥♥
---
Thanks for your hard work!  
---
Sorry for this dumb question, but it seems that I'm don't know how to login now... When I select an account and hit launch, it opens the regular client with my last stored user+password, but the game itself does not open up. 
---
I loved Leveling in GW2 because there was a huge incentive to just getting lost.  You gain XP in everything you do, and the content scales to your level... so I would randomly end up 3 maps away from where I started because I saw some cool tower in the distance or because I was hunting down hero points...
---
I also loved that crafting gave XP.  It was a great way to patch up some gaps in the content.
---
Hmmm, after reading some of that page you linked, sounds like all rewards should be removed from matches in custom arenas.
---
If i remember correctly, Mirage was nerfed in the last 12 ( or something) Balance Patches but is still considered the strongest PvP Class to the point of called being broken OP.
---
Couldn't agree more, RL stuff gets in the way many times. Thank you very much!!! ♥
---
I'm more impressed by you being a diamond legend.
---
I'm just barely about to hit silver invader on the climb to gold knight.
---
If the information from Brazil was true, Nemezis got more into his real life job - politics. Therefore he sorted his priorities well, dropped the game and lives his life outside of internet.
---
Gonna pester you with one last question, if that's okay.
---
You've been playing for longer than I have, so you know Anet better than I do. I've only been playing irregularly for a year and change.
---
Do you think they're going to do something about the economy soon? In the next expansion maybe? Add some new material sinks or something? Or will they just let it slide?
---
My big fear is that, since most players make their gold through selling mats, and mats only keep going down, we're going to reach a point where the liquid gold of most players will dwindle. It's a strange combination of material inflation and currency deflation. Anyway, at least for the expensive stuff I'm investing in now, this would mean that sell orders will be out of reach for the average player - they won't have the gold to be impatient. So buy orders will be smothered underneath an enormous volume of orders, and sell orders will go unfulfilled. Flipping expensive items will be pretty much impossible.
---
I guess the solution would be to invest in cheaper, low return stuff. But that market will quickly become hyper competitive, because that's where everyone will be chasing profit. And I don't think I'm savvy enough to cut it in a market like that.
---
But maybe my forecast is totally off the mark. I seriously hope so.
---
You are definetly not too old, my quess is that you don't know what to look for. VG doesn't really ask for fast reactions rather than listening and actively looking for the tells. The blues do have a very distinctive sound to them before they explode. 
---
" I was too wrapped up in something else (like my dps rotation or whatever) to recognize that the mechanic had begun, and that I needed to move myself (usually not that far!)." 
---
Me all the time hahaha. Consequences of being educated on linear thinking I guess. I will follow your advice, thank you!!! ♥
---
&gt; What would u guys think it would add to the game
---
Many ragequitters.
---
I don't see the point of raising the level cap.
---
Leveling in GW2 always felt more like a tutorial than anything else.
---
I might try that too, thanx ♥
---
Do you have any pictures of the Elon Riverlands that you'll be dropping in the next tour? It's my favorite area in the PoF expansion. :)
---
It wouldn't bring anything but more powercreep. Every level would improve your stats even more. Other than that, nothing would really change except needing new stuff for lvl 100 and with that pissing off a lot of people who would have to regear and stuff. Also legendary armor would need to be changed or it would be weird for the "best" armor in the game not being top level. 
---
The level progression between 1 and 80 is fine and a further 20 levels wouldn't add anything to the game. The secondary progression mechanisms that Anet has implemented work really well for character growth and expansion. I honestly do not see the point.
---
Making GW2 more like WoW is a step backwards IMO.
---
Damn, that was a quick fix! As always, it works perfectly and now I can go back to my easy logins for my daily :)
---
Thanks for your work!
---
Using staff more and staying a bit ranged will definitely help, I was trying too hard with warhorn and axe but I guess I should do that when I get used to mechanics, thank you!!! ♥
---
My favorite is how lead attack were nerfed on Trickery to weaken Deadeye, but the trait is actually bugged and the nerf doesn't take affect when playing DE. It's been like that for nearly 2 months now, shows how much Anet cares.
---
What is unclear?
---
Increasing the level cap is incredibly pointless when they can just design more challenging encounters mechanically around the current level cap. I don't see a reason why this should even happen.
---
I run this with 8GB of ram and it works fine for me.  I've had 1 crash in like 3 days of play, played wvw for about 4 hours in a single session too.
---
Kralk absorbs Aurene's love for us and becomes our new awkward best friend.
---
That looks scarily sophisticated hahahaha, I'll try to get used to the mouse buttons. Thanx!!! ♥ 
---
Funny thing about Chrono nerfs is most of the "nerfs" are just reworks that weaken the spec in 1 targeted gamemode and ends up buffing it in others. This is why Chrono can keep getting nerfed eternally.
---
Did it ever occur to you that this was possible only because all classes functioned the same way in GW1? In GW2 every class is different at its core, you can't just copypaste that system, not without changing every class to use Energy and to use it exactly the same way first. Not to mention overlapping weapon skills. This is simply unfeasible.
---
Any updates on this?? People are stuck for days now, there's constantly 5-10 players waiting at the area
---
Yes. I'll be maxing sound from now on, thank you :D
---
I'm super late here but if you go to LFG under world bosses you can find a world boss train and just do all of them lol. World boss trains are pretty fun
---
It would be pointless. Leveling in GW2 is just a tutorial of sorts, not the objective of the game.
---
Games that increase level cap do so in order to make old gear irrelevant and force people to farm new gear. And that goes against one of the core aspects of the game. 
---
So if they did that, they would also have to upgrade any existing level 80 exotic, ascended and legendary gear so people don't have to get it all again.
---
So the only difference is that leveling up to the cap would take a bit longer, unless the adjusted the exp per level so it's still the same time.
---
What are you talking about.. they only balance around PvE since the start of HoT which was 2015. Every rework they do is centered around PvE and PvP ends up suffering because of it.
---
Yes, I definitely want to success on doing it, thanx :D
---
Yes! I'll try to do a per region list next time
---
i left swtor because every time i hit cap and spent months getting bis gear, they'd raise the level cap and gear again. then they put bis gear in rng lootboxes (earned lootboxes, not p2w)
---
[Reserved]
---
What's the point? It'll make most of the current content easier, people would reach max level with all the ToK that they have, legendaries are supposed to be BIS forever so many people will also have the gear. What could a higher level cap do that elite specs and mastry system don't already achieve?
---
Totally agree :)
---
I still think we give up and evacuate tyria...
---
[I am a stick.](https://brandonsanderson.com/words-of-radiance-deleted-interlude-stick/)
---
Yes, I'll do that, thank you! :D
---
Reaper in open world is also useless because if you are max level then the only time you need to think about your build is farming for gold and reaper sucks at farming. Survivability on a class you leveled up is never an issue because anet made sure to give every class enough tools for survivability instead of direct high hp pool which if you ask me is more stale and unreliable. An invulnerability/blink/shadowstep/stealth/evade/block is better than a definite hp buffer as these things dont have limit to how much they can tank. This is the reason reaper is bad in pvp also.
---
Ignores Z axis btw because reasons.
---
Thanks as always!  Hard to live without LB.
---
I just started playing a few weeks ago. I bought both HoT and PoF. I want to play through the story quests in order to avoid spoilers.
---
I got to 80 last night and just started the Victory of Death chapter of the personal story. But the mastery system keeps telling me that I should spend my mastery points. I can't spend my mastery points because that requires me to play through some parts of HoT. I don't plan on doing that until after completing the Personal Story and Living World Season 2 (which I got on sale for 20% off this week!).
---
My XP bar is full and I get an annoying popup every time I earn XP. Am I losing XP? Can I turn off the popup? It'll be very annoying to have to dismiss it to see chat every time I gain XP.
---
Give them another 2 years, they'll get around to it. /s
---
Ah, the classic conundrum. So none of the problems are them in PvE?
---
Yes, I want to be able to make it as a druid, might be personality related, but I would like to success as the healer momma hahahaha. Thank you ♥
---
Nail in the coffin for GW2.  All the pointless level 80 gear people spent hundreds or thousands of hours getting would be pointless.  People were upset enough when Anet added ascended gear.  I can't imagine the response if we went to level 100 gear with some new tier name.
---
Scourge is pretty weak in terms of sPvP, out of hand in WvW though.
---
Also Scourge beats Reaper :C
---
It's funny because they actually did nerf Berserker somewhat recently when they nerfed all the passive activation traits.
---
They increased Headbutt cooldown by 5 seconds because of unreasonable reasons.
---
hey I am jealous, I only got top 14% hahaha. But still happy to know I might not be as slow as I thought :D
---
A buff to Power Berzerker... the Dream...
---
The current "level cap" is 283...
---
I'm expecting more masteries to increase this too. There's already a lot of things inaccessible without some masteries so increasing the level cap to close off more content to x level and above would be kind of useless.
---
Thank you, i got it a few months back.
---
I played alot of eotm when it was still viable so got alot of ranks from there (hands down eotm best map still), kind of lost interest in wvw after i hit 10k, no goals to work towards :/ hopefully alliance system rework lights the wvw fuel in me.
---
I would greatly recommend buying the candy corn gobbler that pop up during halloween, that perma 50% xp/reward bonus is so helpful. Also try enjoy wvw for what it is, if you focus to much on the rank you will be burnt out.
---
Also if you have played since launch and deleted old characters long time ago you can send ticket to support and ask for it to be restored, granted you have free slot (i dont suggest abusing this, but there is a section where u can restore deleted chars) doing this will get you the birthday boosters that character accumulated while being deleted.
---
Good luck in the mists o7
---
The GW1 update that changed dervs entirely was really fun to watch. Both because of the response and how fun, imho, the changes were to the derv. Was almost like playing a fresh new class again. Same when they changed that mesmer skill, cry of pain i think? It interreupted everyone via aoe regardless of what happened and did damage to them all..then it didnt and people weren't happy hahahaha
---
https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/dev/ at quick glance everything seemed alright, linked here in case anyone else is still reading and wants to try.
---
I'm not sure if you want to add support for D3DX9 stuff natively, in particular D3DXCreateFont, otherwise that arcdps extension patches it out in a very hacky way (https://pastebin.com/SXWhhv7H if you want to keep it in your thirdparty stuff with the imgui patch) when placed in bin64
---
Fuck this game and it's balance.
---
You can also buy armor with the runes already in them. Same with weapons.
---
What? The OP clearly stated that he is not into achievements, story instance-based ones or otherwise.
---
At least, that's how I interpreted '...that typ of archievemt hunter...'

„Obviously“ :D

Thanks bud!

Sorry, I can't agree with you.  Imagine a game with no outfits.  People would undoubtedly say "Why can't there just be a simple outfit system so I can change my entire look all at once and cover up my noob gear?"  There's no making people happy. 
---
Should be noted that at the end of the personal story, it is mentioned that there are five Elder Dragons remaining, which was our first main plot confirmation of six Elder Dragons, and outside CoE and some seemingly random NPC dialogues, is the first such statement that players would experience.

Also some fun trivia: The original Season 1 ended was planned to be entirely different than how it did end. I don't know if you went through Season 1 story recaps out of the game (which are far superior to the in-game one, I'd youtube search Dreamy Abaddon's 3 hour long Season 1 movie or just hit up [guildwars2wiki.com/wiki/Living\_World\_Season\_1](https://guildwars2wiki.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_1) if you'd rather read), but the ending is basically that we injure Scarlet on the outside of the Breachmaker (while fighting the Prime Hologram, her main defenses) and follow her into the drilling airship where we confront her; she triggers an explosion breaking Braham's leg and knocking Marjory unconscious and not breathing. Kasmeer goes batshit crazy on Scarlet and you join her in finishing her while Rox tends to Marjory and Braham, and we save the day, Marjory's recussitated, Kas and Jory kiss, cinematic showing the drill hitting the ley line and waking up the sixth Elder Dragon. Afterwards the heroes go to The Dead End bar to celebrate.
---
The original season 1 ended featured Taimi showing up in the Breachmaker, and somehow messing things up forcing Braham and Rox to go after Taimi, while Kas, Jory, and the PC go after Scarlet; while separated, Scarlet would capture Marjory, and kill her. During her tauntings in this original version, Scarlet would mention the name Mordremoth before dying. Later the group would return to The Dead End to mourn the death of Marjory and celebrate the defeat of Scarlet, and the name was discussed.
---
How do we know this: folks dat-dived and found the voice recordings: [https://soundcloud.com/that\_shaman/sets/livingstory\_1](https://soundcloud.com/that_shaman/sets/livingstory_1)
---
This ending was changed because, during Season 1, players ***loved*** Marjory. So they spared her due to popularity. Ironically, her popularity dropped after Belinda's death and Marjory becoming rather... one-dimensional in writing.
---
Your clickbait title get me crazy.  Knock it off.
---
no, I'm using the shroud as active damage dealer, with a Spite and Soul Reaping - not using minions. I can be in shroud almost constantly and it just deletes anything less than a champ. The added survivability is great too in fractals - many times when my group was down, I could continue fighting the boss on my own and win the fight for the group. So that's why I'm confused why it's seen so low...
---
As an aspiring artist (not a good one by any means), I would respectfully agree with your overall point, but I think you're taking the joke too far into this. The art was good. Great, even. It just wasn't what I was imagining and I wanted to try to visualize how *I* saw the situation, partly just because I was curious if I could. And figured I'd share it since the community also seemed to have a strong opinion on the piece with a different image in mind. Sorry if I offended you, I get where you're coming from from.
---
Admittedly, I have two mesmer alts and only one thief (my main). I don't even enjoy playing any mesmer spec but it is pretty much essential if you want to be a good contributor to a static raid group such as covering that always essential chrono spot.
---
Of course this just points to the abject failure of the elite spec system. We absolutely should have seen multiple chronomancer/druid/warrior alternatives with, at the minimum, PoF but instead the best we can do is a composition relying on more specific professions that is arguably less useful. It isn't a good situation. 
---
Personally, if I'm not just gathering from nodes or farming map currency, I'm killing mobs in Kourna. They respawn frequently, and you can run solo through most of the map. With karmic retribution you'll get a lot of karma on top of the volatile Magic. 
---
If you're looking for a big meta event, though, the Thunderhead Peaks aren't bad. A meta every hour at :45, and they aren't too difficult with a decent group.
---
This may just be my most favourite piece of art I have ever seen on this sub. 
---
And I think I really need this as a t-shirt.
---
Only dragons we don’t know the ‘whereabouts’ on us DSD so I think it’s coincidence.
---
Wow. Thank you!
---
Try adjusting your sound settings in game. I keep most sounds (music, dialogue) low so I can hear discord, but turn other sounds (UI, sound effects) a bit higher so I can hear audio cues more easily.
---
Yeah it's not like weavers can just evade everything while nuking you.... wait.
---
i see something that looks more like a horse.. with veeery much imagination
---
doubt it would be for S5 with the story going the way it is.  we have a better shot of exploring the Mists than going to Cantha at this point.  I could see S5 pulling a S3 and having us jump all around Tyria and Elona either continuing the Kralk war or addressing other story points and maybe tying up loose ends on various fronts.
---
&gt;No song reference this time?:
---
I'm... &gt;!still standing.!&lt;
---
Could also be seen as a reference to To Kill a God though.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
Dear God please yes, Scrapper buffs would make my day! 
---
nah it was wrong. dps meters changed the meta. people use crap builds in crap content that you melt bosses in 5-10 seconds. people trashed his work and start to flame him first way before. you're just "mimimimimi". it's so easy to just antagonize one person instead look at yer flaws and others. he exposed you hard and others for lying in his videos. deal with it.
---
it'd add nothing of value. all it'd do is waste my time
---
I came back myself after a 5 year break just a few months ago. Keep your old characters and start a new one. Level that one until you feel comfortable with the game again and then you can go back to your max lvl characters. HoT is a pain but not too bad. If you need some help and are on NA hit up Qwyksylver Vyqtunos.6312 (that's me) and i'm happy to help 
---
Everyone knows horses aren't real.
---
I played for like 5hours in the days after release in 2012. I’m in the process of restoring my account.
---
Is it worth investing in path of fire in order to boost a character to get mounts before I engage in the content?
---
Any other tips for when I begin my adventures?
---
I really don't think it makes this much of a difference. You still unlock skills very quickly. If someone cannot bear through the first hour of an MMO because he doesn't have utility skills, they are honestly just not patient enough imo. There are many different weapons to explore and skills unlocked through those weapons during the first few levels. 
---
But it is a subjective matter. 
---
As the other comment recommends, try it out. Simulate trying to react to mechanics, dodge, move around, and see how it feels.
---
At 200-300 ping, I can only get through the kit rotation if I don't need to interrupt it (I can just go through button presses and queue skills). I definitely recommend sword over rifle, since rifle 4 can mess you up and it can be hard to control with high ping.
---
they wanted breakbars for players back in HoT-beta. ppl didn't like it 
---
I blame staying up over 24 hours! Not exactly by choice, mind you.
---
&gt;I don't hate the armor described as "garish" in a lot of cases. I'd never use a full set of any of them, but all pieces have a place somewhere in some sort of design.
---
That's fair enough. And I would say I don't hate it universally. I just strongly dislike the vast majority of it. But I think people should be able to wear what they want. I just want some more options that will let me wear what *I* want.
---
&gt;Shorts, jeans, sleeveless shirts, skintights, straight up realistic armor, or things that are light looking (like this outfit the topic is about).
---
I'm not sure if modern clothing would jive with the fantasy aesthetic of the game, but then again, the aesthetic is already slowly being whittled away by stuff like cat ears, aviators, and the other modern stuff already in the wardrobe. So I guess that doesn't bother me.
---
I'd just like some nice models with good textures based on early modern and medieval clothing, primarily for peasants and the merchant class. Folk dress. A few more proper tunics, trousers, shawls, vests, dresses, petticoats, overcoats, shoulder cloaks, breeches, and the like. 
---
It only needs to have the beetle covered in black lion and consortium stickers.
---
Maybe some of the auras could use a buff, fire aura is kinda eh.
---
Also unfortunately the wider playerbase is wising up to this so it’s becoming less profitable much faster each year.  For example current profit is ~55s if you sell at 7.15g and buy orders.  A much better return but as the festival goes on the profitability tanks.
---
Visually it would make sense to fight others, as sometimes trying to check if your enemy has stability is more a distraction that harms gameplay than anything. I would like to see a temporary breakbar as well.
---
Maybe I'm blind, but I just don't see it, or oblivious to the obvious. 
---
Is it released yet? The link takes me to the homepage. I vaguely remember your post from before though and can't wait to see something come to fruition.
---
Don't worry about it. Text can sometimes be tricky to interpret, without human interaction and all. Happy to have a nice, civil conversation.
---
There are two major playpatterns that dominate GW2's gameplay. Mastering them is the key to success in this game, and you'll never stop struggling until you learn them.
---
**First, dodging big attacks is expected and required**. Those knockdown attacks all have long, obvious wind-up animations from the enemies using them.
---
First you need to learn which enemies use knockdowns and other control effects or deadly attacks. Then, you need to learn what those attacks look like when they are used by the enemies in question. Lastly, you need to dodge those attacks, or use your sword 2 skill "Blurred Frenzy" to evade them, or your sword 4 skill "Illusionary Riposte" to block them, or use your fourth shatter "Distortion", or some other way to negate the knockdown effect.
---
Part of this "avoid big attacks" idea is also recognizing minor attacks that do a small amount of damage and nothing else, and not wasting your dodges/evades/blocks on those inconsequential attacks. 
---
**Secondly, you need to kill your enemies quickly**, before they can do anything substantial. This is the reason why everyone recommends full glass-cannon gear with all offense and no defense. You only have a limited amount of dodges, blocks, evades, and distorts to negate attacks, and before you run out of them, you need your enemies to be dead.
---
As a mesmer you have some great tools to help this, especially on your focus weapon. Specifically, your focus 4 skill, Temporal Curtain, can be used to pull all your enemies into one spot all together, so that your sword attacks can hit all of your enemies at once and kill them all quickly.
---
Mesmer has exceptional burst damage too, so it's very good at the "kill enemies before they kill you" mentality. Between your phantasms which are bursty, your sword 2 skill Blurred Frenzy which hits hard, and your Mind Wrack shatter, you can burst your enemies into oblivion before they can land more than one attack on you. 
---
*its
---
12th Feb, there was a link to a forum post somewhere few days ago I think where Gaile gave the date.
---
"Balance patch." Then use the same weapon skills, the same utility skills, as I've used for years. Maybe change some armor piece from berserker to assassins or switch a trait. WOO-FUCKING-HOO. Can't wait.
---
As a sylvari, I object to the use of "potato" as a derogatory insult! I have friends who are potatoes, and they are very fine people!
---
How exactly does a dps meter change the meta?
---
For clarification - I've never used the mirage elite until now. 
---
I love it! Looks like one of those typical qwertee designs. I'd buy that one (:
---
Earth overload had one, right?
---
I'm still buying them on gw2exchange though, but yeah I won't do an organised recorded opening because of inventory management hassles. Only reason I continue buying is to get more luck points just for lulz as 20 mil isn't enough. Plus I guess I could post unorganized data somewhere too if I manage to keep track of drops.
---
They are aware and working on it. 
---
But bugs aren't solved by simply pressing a button. 
---
Development by accretion.
---
I assume you are being a druid so yeah. More importantly role for you is to heal and and control the seekers. And for that you just need to be close enough to support your squad. Give it time and you will get used to it.  
---
The problem wasn't the breakbar, it was how they were done. They were not removable with anything other than CC, and they took too much to break.
---
An ideal situation would be a mix of stability and breakbars. Have different skills remove different amounts of stability, show better how much stability is left without having to look at stack numbers in the stability boon, but still make it removable with boon removal.
---
Yeah they know about it. They put it in their known issue tracker as well.
---
https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/231272908-Known-Issue-Tracker
---
And it have been fixed. Multiple times. But sometimes bugs come back for one reason or another. 
---
To be honest.
---
I didn´t know who SrGrafo was before i posted this Meme and people told me.
---
You can find this Meme ALL over the internet. Never seen it with a Credit.
---
Back me up!
---
If you haven't, then you shouldn't worry at all tbh. Most of these changes will only really affect raids/t4fracs, wvw and pvp. In the latter you can use mirage right off the bat, provided you own PoF, so you probably don't even PvP atm. 
---
Your open world/casual pve experience won't really be affected. And mirage will most likely retain its viabilty even with nerfs, so you don't have to fear investing in a "future mediocre class" at all. 
---
If the class is finally set back more in line with the other classes you might even dodge the mirage hate in chat when you start pvping and wvwing.
---
Afaik they don't actually need all the perms. Leaving some out normally just means certain functions of the bot won't work for you. With GW2 bot for example, you can give it as few perms as you like but if it tries to make an API call to check your LI, it will just get an error if it doesn't have access to your inventories and bank info.
---
True. I wonder if it was fixed or if they just rolled out a reset each time to fix it. I was thinking maybe every so many hours that map could force a new shard  for people to join to help reset the scenario, but I’m not sure how easy that is or if it would mess with meta events and spawns. 
---
Hi, either I am been extremely dense I am not quite sure how the feature works I go to account settings and click the "set login file" type in my credentials close the gw2 account down then hit the ok on the confirmation window I repeat this on my 16 accounts. When I come to load up 3 of the accounts it uses the same email and password as account 1 so I end up having 3 instances of account 1 open.
---
Anyone can help this strange man solve this LaunchBuddy is a godsend.
---
Mfw I'm a druid main
---
For the Tamini!
---
hm, not sure why it's doing that for you brother, it should take you directly to the comic, try this link my friend x
---
https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/guildwars-purpose/the-domain-of-the-lost/viewer?title_no=263655&amp;episode_no=1
---
Considering that Ele has been ass in PvP for what feels like forever... Yeah very uneventful.
---
I want to come back and spend time on this game, but Weaver being so ass in PvP kills any joy. I pray we get buffed to viability. 
---
Does the same thing with that link for me, though searching for Guild Wars there worked.
---
Im still working on my Paint TM skills
---
The silence movie power, really like how the outfits fit the character/situations they suppose to represent  and honestly in black/white the "mammal" really looked suspicious XD
---
I'm not saying they should revert the rework, it would be exactly the same amount of management as it currently is. Instead of getting some trash masterwork armour piece as a level 80 you would instead get a trash minor rune.  It would still get salvaged by the salvage all masterwork option, same number of clicks, same amount of management.
---
Is there any recentish guide anywhere that explains how the following works:
---
Fractals  
---
Raids  
---
Mystic Forge
---
he never said rabid and rampager are good. he said condi on certain bosses are better cuz of mechanics. he just didn't have sinister gear so he ended up soloing mossman with rabid gear or something. you just confuse everybody. and the time you said condi engi is strongest dps while nemesis showed you condi ranger is strongest dps before HoT. lies, lies and more lies from nike.
---
You said dragon and for some reason I see upside down Lion head like on lion's arch sunken statues! for me this gives even more clue.
---
It has a popup for mature content warning, that's probably stuffing it up
---
FOR THE PANINI!
---
For real though, the problem with mirage is if you took off the entire mirage trait tree, and just left it with mirage cloak, the ambushes, and axes, it’d still be pretty decent in sPvP. The entire concept of having full access to damage AND evasion at the same time is inherently busted in sPvP. Distortion was on a 50s cooldown before for a reason.
---
[Mike Z did say they're planning on releasing a mount](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/agbpg7/mike_z_we_are_planning_to_release_a_new_mount/) in one of the upcoming episodes (either season 4 or 5) that no one will expect. Could it be... A horse? *tinfoil hat on*
---
Class mix not but few new weapons types hmm.
---
Hmm, I don’t follow your logic on why 3 different is any less profitable than 2 and 1. That doesn’t make any sense. 
---
For me, I find it’s nice to slowly accumulate volatile, as it’s a great long term source of t6 mats. The spreadsheet I referenced put leather very close on the profit per strike estimates, and then bounty on sickle can be very effective if you’re often gathering rare or high profit plants.
---
Been happening to me since the Lunar Festival patch. I'd be fine at 120-140 ping, 250 in more crowded places and then it jumps up and pretty much freezes the game to the point where I have to use the task manager to quit it.
---
&gt; Just a reminder [that] anet is 50% ~~away of~~ complete in adding ~~actual~~ horses as ~~mounts~~ a playable race.  
---
ftfy.
---
Annnd desktop background at work.  I love this.  :)
---
They happen quite often, I mean I think roughly few months, it was on sale a while ago if I'm wrong someone correct me I think it was December, so I think soon it could possibly have another sale (around February/March), for now just try to enjoy base game to the fullest, it'll make your wait shorter (speaking from experience when I was waiting for HoT sale years ago).
---
I doubt it. I don't see horses have any special ability other than exactly what we already have with raptors.
---
Also, horses don't seem to exist in Tyria. Never seen any (gw1, gw2). Even the rocking horses in orphanage are rocking warthogs.
---
I've been seeing spikes of 2900+ ms and even DCs since 17:00 UTC yesterday.
---
Between 17:00 and 18:00 the launcher was either failing to login or would take 10-15 seconds to connect. Usually this is instant.
---
Changing maps, relogging or PC restart all made no difference and no other online traffic was affected. 
---
Currently I'm playing with a VPN connection. The ping is higher but it's stable and not spiking over 200ms.
---
why cant we get centaur mounts? and just have them shoot arrows at enemies you run pass.
---
I want this so bad
---
Can someone explain the reason to run multiple clients if you can't key input them all together? Just farm guild nodes, stand afk at events? Or can you solo raids somehow.
---
As far as I know, there is one  SMS authentication  system in this game, which triggers only when you run account on PC for the first time. Most of these accounts use this system, It doesnt pop up when I run game through LB. I type e-mail, password, I check "Remember email/password", I log in and press "ok" at LB window, it closes gw2 launcher itself. I saw your previous, deleted post. There is only "0.dat" in this folder.
---
This is in the mists, and probably a fantasy creature, courtesy of Thorn.
---
Sorry :(
---
By clenching one's buttcheeks. 
---
:D
---
you can use sms auth,windows auth and google auth
---
...no actually I love that and as a mesmer main I would fully support this because I'm trash.
---
I have "0.dat" in this folder, should I delete that?
---
Common test they perform to check for afk farming/botting. Naturally people notice they've been teleported.
---
Yes but what about actual horses ? :)
---
I think if this is what you want you have to look for another game. Arena Net have always said this will never happen and everything is designed around that and it is also why we got masteries which is our raise of levels. 
---
As personal opinon and being a old time hard core raider in other games were level cap was raised each time and new raid gear every new raid, at that point i found it to be important but looking at it now from GW2 perspective i don't see why raising our hp and our dps with the levels we get and at the same time raise the hp on the bosses. It is just flipping numbers and nothing have really changed. 
---
10
---
Looks dead to me
---
They'll probably just nerf power damage on axe again....
---
Gum Drops, the Noble Steed was in Elona in Guild Wars 1, though it does currently only reside in the Labyrinth in Guild Wars 2.
---
It's no more a fantasy creature than anything else, though.  I mean, look at it!  It's a magnificent pony.
---
guild commendations are pretty much free if you've done some GM from time to time some takes less than 2 min to do
---
Will be 57 this year and raiding 2 nights a week. Best part of gw2!
---
I'm all for easier to read stability and better stability in general. This game has so much cc its nuts.
---
If you are going to play the game for a while you may as well go for ascended, but in GW2 the best gear doesn't make the same massive difference as other games.
---
How long it takes depends on what you do. If I was desperate to get ascended gear I would craft it.
---
To farm gold I would maybe mix up Silverwastes RIBA farm, and Istan meta. Playing an hour or two a day you should be able to get 20 gold per day. That means you could probably craft an ascended piece every three days or so.
---
Totally agree with this. It's the same 3 classes allowed in squads whilst the odd mesmer, thief and ranger wander around 1 shotting each other occasionally. 
---
While some skills, traits and effects give a determinate stat increase, others give percentages.
---
It would be nice if when you get a % increase, it also showed in parentheses the exact amount it increases (or would increase once applied). 
---
So if you had 2500 power rand you got an effect that gave you +10% power, it would appear as something like this: 
---
* ⏫Power Increase: 10% [+250]
---
And if the stats have derived stats, they could also be shown next to the line. For example, with 2000 base precision:
---
* ⏫Precision Increase: 10% [+250 (9,52% critical chance)]
---
  &amp;nbsp;
---
Also, GW2 could use colored numbers in skills and effects to show the changes from stats. 
---
Blue is used for additions to skills made by traits.  
---
Green/Red could be used for change sin values caused by increases or decreases in stats. And it could also be applied to traits. So when you looked at that trait, the part that changes because of your stats would be green instead white:
---
* ⏫Power Increase: 10% [***+250***]
---
* ⏫Precision Increase: 10% [***+250 (9,52% critical chance)***]
---
And these colors should be used also in the numbers that appear in the line with the name of the skills and traits: blue recharge time when a trait reduces recharge, green when alacrity reduces the cooldown, red when chilled increases it, and so on.
---
1. delete the accounts listed in launchbuddy if you have some from before this version.
---
2. recreate the accounts from scractch in launchbuddy.
---
3. when you "Set Loginfile", log in manually with remember login name/password checked with new credentials.
---
4.launch the game. 
---
5. tab out, press the "OK" launchbuddy confirmation.
---
that should have created a new dat file for the newly created account
---
Well it makes sense that the PC, like in-lore characters, already knows about Mordremoth even if it's not mentioned "on screen" to the player. The game was released with quite a few clues about its existence, and obviously people in Tyria knew. Most obvious clues (for the player) in CoE : the upper level (coil area in Mount Maelstrom) has 6 sides representing the 6 Elder Dragons (including a green plant side) and the end boss of storymode, in which Kudu put powers from different dragons, has something from Mordremoth.
---
I mean, I want to believe you; but tbh that sounds like a fake creature based on a centaur.
---
Might also be able to find some of those on the GW2 wiki. Just in case they can't help. 
---
So did anyone win one of the big prizes? Like PC or even the car?
---
Oh mine says 3/8 too and I just wasn't paying attention to it since I skip events when I'm doing the story quest.
---
Surely you don't think everybody has a fair chance of winning this? 
---
It's worth it if you plan to do fractals or if you want to optimize your stats. The improvement over exotic is not huge, but noticeable.
---
I'd suggest starting by getting ascended trinkets from LW maps (bloodstone fen, bitterfrost frontier, the new thunderhead peaks, etc.) or Laurel vendors, and if you can use it, am ascended weapon from the Caladbolg quest. 
---
Once you at least get your trinkets, you can infuse them and start playing fractals. Ascended gear drops rarely in fractals, but they also provide materials you can use to purchase ascended gear chests. 
---
Also, you should start working on crafting, and at least focus on the professions that can craft the appropriate weapons and armor for your preferred profession. Crafting is not all that daunting, especially if you have been saving the crafting materials you picked up while leveling.
---
Well if felines and devourers are amphibian ranger pets, then so too can horses become underwater mounts.  
---
Underwater seahorse mounts!
---
There actually already a mini that's a skritt riding a fake horse carried by skritt that was introduced at last year's lunar event.
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini\_Lunar\_%22Horse%22](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Lunar_%22Horse%22)
---
not being able to skip launcher anymore just sucks ...
---
\^ this is about the extent of content in WvW for the best part of a year and a half, I'm afraid. 
---
dad?
---
That was the funniest fucking balance patch lol
---
When you charge over $20 for mount skins, there's no excuse not to.
---
i still cant believe anet screwed us over (again) on this
---
yes, i have plans for a chronicals series... basically featuring prominent characters from the gw2 story. mini series telling their story from when they weren't around us as the commander, rytlock and trehearne are planned so far to have a chronicle. Rytlock's story will be dealing with his sword and the foefire, trehearne's will be dealing with his internal struggle against mordremoth
---
In dps Reaper is about the lowest of all the none support classes. Doesn't matter open world though, you can use it and have fun there. It is moistly a raid thing.
---
Always in all online games
---
This is true to a certain extent. When you become proficient enough as a Weaver, you \*really\* start to know every evade the class has to offer. At the moment, I survive more when playing Weaver than Tempest due to Tempest being more bulky I suppose? But interestingly enough I can evade more damage as a weaver than as a tempest.
---
YES! Not sure if it's just me but it remembers only the last one but what is the most important Instance Manager don't swap windows when I click on them. I had the same bug in 1.8.2. Anyone else have the same issue?
---
You are in the minority then. most people hate leveling the first time (myself included), so much so they added the lvl 80 boost to stop people from quitting out of boredom, since the real game starts at 80
---
Supposedly they fixed it and it came back
---
Sure - I'm not disputing it - just curious why. Granted, I only tried 5 professions at 80 (mesmer, guardian, elementalist, ranger and reaper), but out of all, the reaper feels the fastest (followed by guardian and mesmer)
---
name d912pxy to d3d9_chainload
---
I can't believe how many times this bug comes back xP.
---
Open your crashlog file in %appdata%/Guild Wars 2/Arenanet.log in editor and delete all content. Then save it.
---
If its like other events it simply involved resetting the instance.
---
Now do the same thing in PvP so we can get rid of botters. Thank you.
---
Have you checked wiki? It has info on all of those.
---
I've never heard S tier equated with banned. S is the best, A is good but not optimal, B is suboptimal, C is bad.
---
Banned stuff goes in a banned-tier in my experience.
---
hey, the support chrono and condi mirage both interest me, would they be good outside of raids? also i need to do living world for viper gear?
---
thank you so much I didnt know how much i used this until it was broken, but I must be missing something since you can't name accounts and when I click the icon the game doesnt start :S
---
Totally agree. I'm running a Ryzen 5 @3.8MHz and a 2070 and I can barely pull 40-50 in cities and metas. I'll tap into the 100s in open areas with less people. This is all 1080p at ultra/max settings.
---
There's not a lot you can do to get crazy high frame rates out of the game. It's just not that well optimized, sadly.
---
Although, I'm looking forward to a stable release of that DX9 to DX12 mod that was just put out. That sounds amazing if it can work all the bugs out...of the system. 
---
The wiki has up to date detailed info and there are more in depth guides that I'll link but in general:
---
[Fractals](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractals_of_the_Mists) - 5 man short "dungeons" that scale in difficulty. Currently there are 20 different fractals spread throughout the 25 spots in each of the four difficulties fr a total of 100 levels. As you go up in fractal level enemies get stronger and start to deal agony damage. This damage is percent health based and can only be mitigated with agony resist in the form of infusions that you get from doing fractals. Infusions can be combined to make better ones and need to be socketed in ascended gear. At level 100 the suggested agony resist is 150. Fractal instabilities are extra challenges that you'll start seeing as you get to higher fractals, up to 3 at a time. [dT](https://discretize.eu/) has up to date builds and guides for high level play and this [detailed fractal starting guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bt-vFeeLAeEsaoz72bkc4ZODsudIQ2hiQdvSnFYLtw/edit) has more information.
---
[Raids](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Raid) - 10 man mainly boss fights with many mechanics. They have team compositions to try and get as much damage as possible while keeping everyone alive and killing the boss quickly. They feature enrage timers so if you are too slow you fail or have to deal with a much harder boss. [Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/) is the go to for builds and guides in general and [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7zlH3pVPvW21WIh5-qL-IXDeABtJzIqnZYXP8tCcM0/edit) is my suggested in depth raid info. For gearing I'd suggest looking at [this guide on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) as well.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Forge - Used to combine items together. It's what is used to upgrade materials to a higher tier, turn 4 of an item into a possible higher or same tier random item (or of the same type if you use say 4 rare greatswords you'll get a rare or exotic greatsword back (average level is taken into account with some slight upward adjustment). Mainly people use it for the daily and making [mystic salvage kits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Salvage_Kit) though others try and gamble for things like precursors from it.
---
I have now downloaded and used this version. It works perfectly for what I need. Thank you very much for your efforts and time!
---
I always wanted to ask: why this thing called "buddy" like the famous bot? Is it just a coincidence? :)
---
I got my alt acc updated to full core game, u can ask around if any keys left from friends or so. As core acc or f2p u can star journey to fractals and that is not just fun but quite a lot of work. There is also a lot of farm to do , and u can buy gems and gems can be used to add living story achis. Fractals are awesome btw.
---
You can easily practice dhuum green alone as a thief by stealthing the first reaper. 
---
full brained people go to melee deimos, fail, then go to ranged strat and deny they do it. isn't rifle DE like 4 buttons? 
---
Keeping my guys right on the spawn so they don’t miss it ha ;)
---
Wow its almost as if simple incompetence is the root of all of our problems.
---
Even do i think reaper is hardly enough mobile for wvw i like that u try roam on it. Best luck :).
---
It’s referencing the poster for the classic 1998 cyberpunk anime “[Akira](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(1988_film))”
---
So my suggestion for people starting out is always to gear a power DPS class and learn the fights while working on the legendary armor collection. When you finish the first stage of the collection you get a free full set of armor which I would suggest using on your druid for harrier (I used my precursor &gt; legendary on my mesmer later since there are many stat combos that are desired and being able to gain or drop toughness for tanking is important). Remember that you can [stat swap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) armor and weapons if needed. On to accessories you can get a "free" amulet from [act 2 PoF achievements](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Path_of_Fire:_Act_2) and the back from finishing the PoF story and doing one of the [raise the banners collections](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Raise_the_Banners:_Amnoon_Arbitrator). You can buy a ring and accessory from S4E2 [Ethall](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ethall) and attune one of the rings to use a second copy of it. For the other parts you can farm trade contracts if you want (I liked setting some alts next to the tomb of primeval kings chests for easy daily farming) or use raid tokens. Making the PvP, WvW, or Fractal stat selectable gear is also an option, you can check [this guide for more details on gearing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character).
---
Just look for Akira on google.
---
I think it would be great to add horses for the FtP players. No abilities, faster than run but a bit slower than a raptor
---
Clipping literally makes or breaks an outfit for me. Literally all of the long hairstyles have clipping issues with chest pieces or shoulder.
---
Can someone sum up the White Stag and Shield of the Moon stories for Sylvari? Just finished up the Green Knight one and it was good, but was thinking of starting over to try the other two, but not sure if it's worth doing. lol.
---
Open and salvage if u craft with the mats
---
Salavage to raise your luck 
---
Sell for straight gold 
---
They offer very little improvement over exotics (like 5-10% more). Their main advantage is that they allow you to do higher tier fractals and are account bound, meaning you can swap them between alts.
---
If they ever add horses as a mount, I want them to be an inexplicably expensive &amp; secretive mount, just for the sake of keeping the ol' running joke on horses in the franchise going.  
---
Congrats OP, your edgelord characters made me want to change main. 
---
Diviner stats are now added into the pool of Path of Fire stats so any item that can select them should be able to get diviner along with the all stat sets found in WvW, PvP, Raids, and Fractals. Both builds are good outside of raids though for open world and fractals power damage is preferred to burst enemies down faster. [This guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) has details on where to get gear, again any PoF stat selectable gear or all stats can get diviner.
---
How many times smaller is Zhaitan? 
---
I read somewhere it works out to be a 12.5% increase for a 70-90g vs 20g? cost. As for how long, some depends on alts/how much crafting you have already done. Its 30? days to craft all the time gated mats, if nothing else you might be able to sell them off for a bit of gold over the long term.
---
There is a bot called buddy? :o
---
It was alled LaunchBuddy because a buddy is something everybody can relate to. Another reason was that Gw2 Launcher, Starter?, Helper.... simply does not stand out as a unique name and very likely would be mistaken for the vanilla gw2 launcher.
---
Best is GMs in raid getting green on Deimos or Slot mecanics, lul.
---
BTW getting something like [copper-fed](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Copper-Fed_Salvage-o-Matic) in an account slot will save you many slots across all characters and just getting your bags all to 18-20 slots is more than enough room for most people. Also remember that you should be depositing items into your collections and you can store extra stuff in your bank. Oh and just selling/salvaging your gear when it gets full.
---
How do I take this across computers?  Sorry, newbie with this software.
---
Well there are some items we have no idea what they do or why they exist in the game , tie it up with a legendary horse mount that that_shaman kinda hints and nudges us subtly with his tweets and posts since he would probably notice a new model of a horse in game :)
---
Balance patch? Within a couple weeks. Not sure of the exact timing, but we're in a PvP season and they always drop then. 
---
Yea right my plasma sword will slice right through your weak ass bones
---
You are lucky, 1.8.4 is the first version which does not use machine specific encryption as accountdata is now encryptet by the Gw2 Gameclient. Copy %appdata%/Gw2 Launchbuddy to your target computer and you should be good to go.
---
Ya, that's my biggest complaint for the mastery system, I had to go through it when I did all of season 2 as well and it got annoying lol. They should have just hid the tracks until you did the first story mission like they do with raids now. Anyways I did just [bother to write up a recap on season 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ak0p8l/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_january_26_2019/efetwqq/?st=jrl7uqr0&amp;sh=f5719b18) and there is a 3hr video linked there as well if you're really interested. Might as well have someone else read it since I spent so much time writing it all.
---
If you do some WvW (2-3h a day), and set Triumphant Armor reward track, you should be able to buy a full set of ascended armor after a week or two.
---

---
Well...we better get to them before they wake up then.
---
You want a training mode or easy mode, which could be implemented by giving the players various buffs such as increased vitality and  toughness.
---

---
I am sure Anet will be thrilled to implement a virtual training area for each and every mechanic for all 19 current raid bosses. Or maybe they could just add some player buffs at the raid entrance and call it training mode.
---
What is launchbuddy?
---
Wasen't there a cave in harathi hinterlands? Center of the map give or take. Currrently at work i'll check later o.o
---
I had a tour of the ANet offices about 6 years ago, right around launch, and they had a big monitor that showed literally where everyone in game was.  It was pretty cool seeing all the little dots move around.
---
Indeed, I’m not sure why they’ve marked my comic as adult lol... maybe webtoons wasn’t the best platform too launch this on. I’m probably going to fix the mobile issues and this adult tag and relaunch it again next week x thanks for the update though brother x
---
Fuck, that was the only halfway decent VM farm (that I'm aware of). None of the resources are as good as Winterberries in LS3 which makes them a pain.
---
[For those who don't see it.](https://i.imgur.com/Sbxzo9l.jpg)
---
The original spelled the same A-KI-RA but in katakana; this one... RU-KE? Definitely not PE-TE ( ペテ ) /shrug
---
As someone who came from WoW.
---
Ide actually be really happy if Anet Never adds a horse mount. 
---
What is it going to do? Run fast?
---
All of the mounts we already have make a horse seem very boring IMO.
---
Yea this seems to only be working for one log in....if you make a new/second one it just uses the last log in credentials
---
screen shots if you can, there was not an event that makes them spawn at all.
---

it was WINDROCK!
---
Yes. The eye sees all!
---
So for some reason mine is bringing up the first email saved from the previous one.
---
Let's say I set  "account1@gmail.com"  to the first account.  Then I try to do the 2nd account.  It'll still come up with the same email saved from the previous one.  What am I doing wrong?
---
Yes, and there are videos too, and one was even a pretty upvoted post on the sub too
---
Could just do the "this map is closing because of too few players" except it's not too few.
---
Read the OP and follow the links... jeez
---
Read the OP and follow the links.. jeez
---
Herald is only really used effectively in PvP, renegade has good support and condi DPS builds.
---
Same for me.
---
Cutting edge achievement: should I craft mordant edge or buy cothol field burner off the TP? I have 0 weapon crafting.
---
1) White Stag is a creature of the Dream and would be very good at helping the Sylvari people. Friend who helps you catch it actually is Nightmare Court and wants to torture it to increase their influence on the Dream. You get the Stag.
---
2) You rescue a male Sylvari. Was poisoned and left for dead by the Nightmare Court. He wants to rescue his female love interest. She has turned to Nightmare and wants him to join. We find out that once you become Nightmare (even forcefully by torture) you never leave.
