I was on his stream when people were baggin on gw2, and he would tell them GW2 has a lot of great to it.

---
The problem is they need to start communicating better with players about the future. I dont mean oh hey LWS5 is coming. I mean tell us you are not going to abandon raids and fracts, wvw, tell us you are looking at adding in new features like alliances elite specs a new class or race. Tell us these are the things you are working toward. But to remain silent makes the player uneasy.
---
They need to add in new content be it in the form of an expansion, or expansion type things added alongside the LWS. Otherwise it looks like the game is in a slow spiral to maintenance mode. And they are just pushing as much gem store as they can before the realization sets in on the playerbase.
---

---
Gw2Hook comes with Reshade and you shouldn't use sweetfx when reshade is a thing.
---
Could you do one for Aion as well from an soft??
---
There are people on this subreddit so salty about this game (or just their sad lives). They are determined to keep yelling the "the game is dead/dying" hoping that if people read it enough, it will become "true" (basically US politics). Very sad sad people.
---
probably up there in good cartoons like adventure time, spongebob, avatar, gumball... I still need to catch up on it.
---
I mean it's also the core design principle of FFXIV, RDR2, Cyberpunk 2077, and basically every game ever made according to the other half of the SJW/incel equation.
---
The term is losing all meaning if you throw it at a game like this, which is guilty of "having gay characters who show up for one episode every 2 years" and basically nothing else.
---
Why the fark dont they advertise? This decline is due to a bunch of things, development, upper management, lack of visibility, its like they say, meh why bother. If you want a successful game that has a future, then these  things have to happen. You always have a development team working on future content releases, upper management needs to keep their azzes out of development, and you promote your game.
---
&gt; That it to say we're 7 years into the game, a couple of years out from an expansion now, and we're still doing more than we did quarter 4 in 2016 and quarter 1 2017. 
---
They could decide to scrap expansions and just release expansion content in the Living World model. It might take two years to make a full expansion, but if they just release elite specs with Living World seasons they wouldn't need the big expansion drop.
---
It might be more sustainable for them to build small and medium updates to the game compared to big expansion updates followed by small updates every few months.
---
It's not good considering GW2 is ANet's primary source of earnings.  
---
They don't have other products to fall back on like Blizzard(e.g. no Overwatch,  no WoW Classic).  
---
If their earnings and growth continues to decline, they won't exist as a company in within 10 years.
---
Ahh, thanks for the concise explanation. It all finally makes sense now lmao.
---
HoT had more interesting content overall but the PoF mounts definitely carried that expansion on its back.
---
Same but jesus christ the early game in FFXIV is so mind-numbingly slow. I would have died of alcohol poisoning if I had to take a shot every time the main story quest forced me to do that pointless run from Horizon waypoint to go talk to Minfilia in her cuckshed.
---
Armor sets are now reserved as in-game rewards, while outfits are primarily Gem store items.
---
If anything I feel like if they would forgo the hard trinity the game's combat would excite me more. The music *is* fucking god-tier though, that's for sure. I got goosebumps in that Ramuh fight during the story from that music.
---
No man's sky's mouthpiece (Sean Murray) also was radio silent while they fixed the game so if they were following his example you wouldn't know
---
Honest words and cool that you are reconsidering your own character.
---
  
---
\&gt; he LOVES this game. did you see the liquidation videos? i would consider  myself having "beat" the game if i had played as much to the point that  my account was worth as much as his seems to be   
---
You forget that he is a streamer with a great followerbase. Yes, he does raids and has a good gold income, but let's make clear that without a doubt he has probably accepted gifts before his account was this valueable.
---
Well, it is newsworthy just not related to recent happenings. Someone leaving the team is almost always talked about.
---
Thank you!
---
This is the historical list of all drops from BLCs from 2012 to 2016.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Chest/historical_1
---
It's possible the list is incomplete, but if you go through the items you'll find that all skins/etc. aren't Key RNG only and all items could be sold on the TP or bought in the gemstore directly.  This also fits with my memory of there being no BLC Exclusives from before 2016 (been playing for 6 years).  Pretty positive BLC Exclusives only started popping up very late 2016 early 2017,
---
Both sides agree with this.
---
If there was one game I could go back and experience for the first time again, it would be the original Guild Wars without question. The sense of adventure, friendship, and more I had on my original play through when I was younger will never be met.
---
Because armor skins (full armor sets) take months to create. Outfits are way simpler and faster to create. If they make only armor skins instead of outfits, we would get like 2 armors per year. They also said that they prefer to make things like armor sets available as ingame rewards and not via gemshop. 
---
They actually *do* create armor skins for the gemshop, but only the "easy parts", means no chests and no pants. But no full sets.
---
Thread removed: Do not use this subreddit as a marketplace.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
You know the cash shop on FFXIV is *completely* irrelevant, right? You can't even see it ingame, you need to log onto the mog station and click through a very half-assed looking interface to see a few ridiculously underwhelming and overpriced mount and outfit skins. Most of which you can apparently earn ingame anyways. There is also no currency exchange like on GW2, so again the cash shop is irrelevant and more than likely an extremely negligible influence on their revenue compared to the sub fees.
---
This is awesome!  Didn’t think of it at first!
---
I respectfully disagree. Personally I think a sale is the best way to handle it.
---
I felt the same why about swtor but eventually you learn to move so you’re not constantly sad seeing something you used to love die.
---
I told myself that coming back to GW2 Reddit would lead to depression, but this... this completely broke my heart and soul.   
---
Sigh, if only it was real.
---
My guild was anticipating GW2 for WvW for a long time.  We were the top WvW guild on the #1 WvW server. We then transferred to a mid tier server and quickly that server became the #1 WvW server. Then we went to Europe, achieved #1 there, and Oceanic where once again we were #1.
---
Do you know what we got for it? Absolutely nothing. No WvW specific gear. No titles, no achievements. Just bragging rights which was soon forgotten once we stopped playing. 
---
If a game wants to hold attention of players after launch, perhaps offer an incentive for the modes of the game you create, not just the ones that are expected.
---
I'm at lvl 24 quests. When does it end. Bitch is getting annoying, ngl.
---
The problem gw2 has is more to do with people running out of things they want to chase....real or perceived.  Sure there might still be content but players need something they want and can chase.
---
Wow does this remarkably well
---
Gw2,has fine content and sure the cool pvp stuff seems ignored...really this game to me evolved into a casual players game...that's fine to have that appeal but a game needs hardcore players to draw crowds.  The game lack that.
---
What am I chasing? Skins and cosmetics...I can buy cool ones...so now I'm playing for a mount and just to play?  
---
Fix that and drop in steam and this game gets a secons life and competes fully with the big boys...like it did at launch.
---
I hope it can be saved. I spent 5 years playing WvW nightly until I left the game for a while. That's a mode that should never die, it's too much fun.
---
I'm personally excited that we can now get HoT masteries anywhere in Tyria. It made me so sad when they said PoF wouldn't include HoT originally - I wanted to glide in Elona.
---
Dragonfall really showed how great the masteries can be when you have access to all of them (even some of the S3 ones which I thought were pretty junk ended up really good - like lava tubes). I thought mounts made so many redundant but I discovered they work really well together (lava tubes into griffon or skyscale is one the better combos).
---
Its great with minions though, go look at the last “Boots bad builds”
---
It would die simply because the majority of the playerbase probably play GW2 due to no sub fee.
---
These are charr though, known for being wild, ruthless and brutal.
---
I dig the band cuz it's a fun gimmick, but I really hope they won't roll with the "stoopid floofy kitty" aesthetic all season long.
---
If I am the one giving it then yes.
---
I suspect ANet will focus on “carefully controlled media announcements” from now on.  I suspect the big event was them testing the waters.  
---
I think they want to “sell the message” that the company is on the “up and up”.  “Exciting updates are around the corner” and “GW2 is growing” will probably be the key marketing messages.  ANet want hype, they want consumer exciting and they want a “media buzz”.  
---
The thing is they have no choice.  The earnings for past 7 years, ANet’s financial have been consistently stagnant over the past 7 years.  There is no financial growth and the company has shrunk considerably in staff numbers.  Anecdotal evidence regarding GW2 suggests “consumer confidence” is at an all-time low.  They need to attract new consumers and marketing is but one way to achieve that.  
---
We’re probably not going to see any “what went wrong” messages from Mike O’Brien anytime soon, which is what people have been suggesting.  If anything, we’ll probably see many “exciting content coming soon” announcement in the very near future.
---
 At no additional cost to yourself.
---
If it's vital to have a mastery (like Koda's flame) for a new map, there's no rule saying it can't be unlocked by either the S3 episode or the S5 episode. I expect it's more likely we will see it used for things like the Roller Beetle breakable walls - nothing vitally important is behind the, but it's a nice little bonus for people who have the mastery.
---
I actually think it's really cool that we could run into an exhaulted marking somewhere in the Far Shiverpeaks and use a HoT mastery to trigger an event, or unlock something with it. Even some of the most basic HoT masteries have potential interesting uses.
---
Just don't bring in any of the world's Rian Johnsons and we should be okay.
---
Assuming you wanted the Gem Store Team to adress the lack of new elite specs today in a blog post.
---
Yeah. That asura cosplay of slothazar is great.
---
I have to pay the sowing costs, they dont.
---
I wish GW2 story content was as engaging as GW1 story content. I actually found GW1 story missions enjoyable and challenging at times. In GW2, more often than not, I find it to be tedious dialogue with damage sponges in between.
---
The fact that player concerns are ignored but asking for money is going full steam ahead; tells you everything you need to know about how Anet views us. "shut up and give us your money"
---
New publisher yes, It's an EU company, so they have some rules to follow.  
---
According to them, no more P2W. Just cosmetics.  
---
No more Apex, no more premium account, no more labor pots. If they actually deliver, then it will be promising AF.  
---
Main reason I left AA was because of crafting and regrading.
---
Are the servers still up? I would 100% play with people
---
Fuck fuck fuck. Did u play the beta previously? I’m so doubtful but this is the best mmo for me and for many people :(
---
Given that the preview showed them showing off firearms and effigy's, I'm sure there will be plenty of badassery as the legions deserve. Meattoberfest still stands as one of the greatest things they ever came up with, so if it can be even half as entertaining I'll be pleased.
---
Oh, so you want no communication at all about topics that dont interest you until your interests are covered. Got it.
---
&gt; LS2 is not worth in terms of rewards. It's worth buying if you care about the story but other than that you won't miss much by not purchasing. It gives core Tyria mastery points so it can help if you are struggling to get enough, but you can get enough without LS2 (you will have to grind some achievements though).
---
There is one of the best armor sets (imo) gated behind LS2 (Carapace Armor). Several of the pieces can only be obtained from completing the story steps.
---
There are a LOT of bugs going on with new stuff recently.
---
Do you have any tips for getting used to the combat? Last time I tried playing I was a lancer and couldn't get into the global skill cool down.
---
I did! I was hooked on Beta! Like seriously hook. I guild was from Ollo and we were the first one that manage to build a merchant ship and train in Freedich. At the peak of my guild, we had more than 10 merchant ships going to freedich everynight!  
---
Everything went to hell after the failed castle capture, not because we were lacking, but because the game decided to disconnect the person that has all the materials to build the capture item. He couldn't log in for hours.  
---
My guild slowly died after that.
---
Well the builds I mentioned are viable for roaming and small groups. When it comes to 30+ players ina squad, the commander will request specific classes as they complement each other in a fight. These classes are pof builds except for Revenant where herald is always used.
---
W7 came out 9 MONTHS after W6, not really much to brag about. Would you be happy with living story update every 9 months? Probably not, right?
---
Weapons set is the last thing they should be worried about for WvW. People's been asking for actual balancing and reward structure for ages. The most important update you're talking about: alliances, has been "worked on" for 2 years already and all we got now is "talk to you in the coming months".
---
After these two points of yours I actually didn't even bother to read the rest as I'm sure it holds the same value...
---
Yup servers are up and people still play it.
---
This was so well done and literally has EVERYTHING I would want in an expansion.
---
Fuckin sick
---
More like I want the gaping hole in the boat fixed before gilding the captain's desk.

What? Very few raid encounters have significant rng that can decide if you kill the boss or not. Your group and the skills of individual players decide if you can beat a boss. They require persistent effort with a group. The chance of failure comes from your skill. Raids are the definition of non random persistent efforts.
---
Would you rather have the game play for you? It's the case in most open world content where failing is impossible and the game holds your hand.
---
Nothing if you're a casual

&gt; a whole set of underwater themed Legendaries
---
Not a whole set, or even "underwater themed", just adding the missing underwater legendaries that were scrapped from gen 2 (spear, harpoon gun, trident)!
---
Everything about this chart says "we tried to make more money and we failed so now we're going maintenance mode."
---
I've been around long enough to lose games before. I've seen MMOs shut down, it does happen. And I'm worried that it's going to happen here because Anet cannot monetize their game.
---
This is the often-repeated rant that holds some truth: "Why won't Anet take my money?"
---
They've managed to completely lock mount skins in the gem store, almost completely lock all flashy back items in the gem store, almost completely lock all outfits in the gem store, and they're still bleeding out. Because most of their products fucking suck. So let's real talk on what Anet could have done to stop this. It's probably too late but still. 
---
1. Fix hair. If helmets worked with hair, people would actually buy gemstore headgear. There are so many gemstore hats it's embarrassing that Anet never fixed hair/helmets. One of their baseline products is almost unusable for fashion, which is its only purpose. 
---
2. Fix black lion chests. Right now they provide absolute trash. It's virtual goods! You're not giving away anything real, Anet. You can afford to up BLC drops a lot more than you can afford to rent a theatre for some horseshit press release. They improved by putting in unique high value rewards like mount skins but at the end of the day they are only appealing to gamblers. No one looks at a BLC and says they want to get it and see what they get. They buy it to try get one of the rare top tier items. That's a great way to retain whales and completely alienate casual buyers. You could say the strategy is working, but the numbers show it clearly isn't. Every BLC should give me something I want. Because Anet wants me to buy more, and that's what will encourage me to buy more. Doesn't have to be a 2K gems item. But I should be slightly disappointed at worst, not actually wondering why I spent real money on a bag of T3 mats and a repair cannister. 
---
3. Split outfit headgear. The technology is clearly there already. Let me match one outfits body and another outfit hat. Come on, that's the bare minimum. And it wouldn't take any effort. Fashion wars improves, revenue goes up. Mix and match also promotes more buying because you want to use different things with each other so you buy more than just the one or two you need.
---
4. Basic mount skins available in game. This isn't a revenue drop, it's a revenue increase. It brings everyone into the market. If everyone is playing dress-up, then people want to 'win' at dress-up with the nicest things. If the line is just "people who pay vs people who don't" then it's a lot less fun for the flashy skin users to be flashy. They're in a room full of potato sacks, instead of a room full of nice but not quite as nice as their fashion.
---
5. (Desperation option) stop supporting gold to gems. While I personally love it, it's cost Anet a lot of revenue and its actually tied to #4. Technically gemstore items can be farmed with gold so nothing is truly exclusive. That's why it's okay that Anet has categories that are unique to the gemstore, but also why a lot of people buy from the gemstore without using money. Leave in an option to buy gold, I don't care. I won't use it, some people will. But if you reframe gem store categories then Anet could cancel gold to gems without pissing everyone off. For example if mount skins are in the game through collections I'll be way less upset that I can no longer gold to gems for the 2K skins thst are in the gemstore. Now that's a luxury purchase, plain and simple.
---
There are a lot of other things (fix sylvari male armor scaling) but those are the really low-effort things Anet could do. Choices that if they made them, they'd be better off financially.
---
did you just assume my gender? Check your privilege, racist
---
PRAY RETURN TO THE WAKING SANDS
---
You must look at the greater picture. NCSoft fully owns Anet. NCSoft has plenty to fall back on, hack their mobile shit makes them multiple times more profit than PC games. NCSoft has proven in the past that they are quite quick with closing games and development studios that they think aren't worth keeping in business. I'm not saying that the plan is to milk everything out of Anet and GW2 that they can and then throw them away. But I'm sure they have a plan. The former is a possibility.
---
In my experience, I don't feel the need for a new elite spec for my main.
---
It's the classes that I don't play because I find their specs annoying or boring to play that I'd really love a new elite spec for.
---
She comes out of nowhere plot-wise, totally disconnected from the established series, some old characters just so happen to gasp and remember her now. It's not terrible, but quite bland. But yeah soooo many similarities to Scarlet, except it's all love, friendship and magic in the end. Must admit I enjoyed watching the movie as a GW2 fan :D
---
Though that means they would need to have all specs ready to be able to give an option of whatever you want.
---
Maybe. I'm homebound by circumstance and running a medium sized guild since before launch. I really like the people, so I hang out a lot. It's not always active playing.
---
The alternative would be EVERYONE waiting 8 months rather than having a 1/9 chance of waiting 8 months.
---
If there was some way to use whole weapon skill bars from other professions (i.e., GW1 skill system) sign me up!
---
dulfy actually left the game?
---
When the west coast and PNW outrage slash safe space culture makes it to your day games development team.
---
These young adults can't handle online toxicity.
---
You wonder why anet doesn't communicate? They wouldn't be able to handle the toxicity....
---
Didn't use to be like this, devs could handle the trolls, which are usually children.
---
Thank you for all the responses, my question is answered now :)
---
I will avenge you would be pretty silly to use in PvP. Your allies all already rally from 1-ing a downed person.
---
if you aren't looking for a long term game, go for it. if you are looking for something that you will enjoy for years to come, you are way too late.
---
Last I heard, her real life work took priority.  When I've been on, I never see her anymore so I assume she plays very minimally.  I'm not actually sure if she full quit the game though.
---
How can one post, simultaneously produce so much excitement and disappointment?
---
He didn't say that at all. Literally. Not even close.
---
The thing with Path of Exile at least is I bet they still see massive jumps at the beginning of major releases, with it dropping over time. It's just that they release major content often enough that it never really tapers off to the point where they see a major low, so it looks like they're always generally rising.
---
The release schedule also keeps people interested, even the less hardcore players.
---
Gw2 is older. The combat is really smooth compared to something like ff14, graphics is decent as well. As for making money, I have not properly read it yet because I didn't wanna get hyped too much, but I will be surely read it thoroughly before it launches
---
Holy crap this is freaking amazing
---
That is a blast from the past. I'd be standing in ascalon waiting for a good price for a droknar run.
---
I remember that in GW1, winners of certain tournaments or competitions got a unique pattern for their capes.
---
I know it's not the same as a private server. That would be a step in creating a private server though, would it not?
---
I'm super stoked on build templates.  Looking forward to another great year of GW2, not paying any attention to all the complaints.
---
The only thing that really sucks about this game is "not so secret"
---
With axe the way it current is true.
---
As is Axe (A condi weapon) scales far better then sword does.
---
Something to keep in mind is that it's really hard to know how the public is going to react to something you put out. It may seem obvious in hindsight, but before you put it out to the public you have a much smaller range of people looking at it. Those people also often have different perspectives as developers; they know all the constraints that got them to the point they are at and their perceptions may be jaded by that. In this situation, they did have a lot of cool stuff to announce, so they were probably feeling like that would drive the narrative.
---
As far as tweets, one thing to note is that Rubi is one of the people who post on the official Guild Wars 2 twitter. If she was posting something official, it would be there. Likewise you can't consider a former dev who was laid off over half a year ago to be speaking officially for Arena Net in any capacity.
---
I agree with you that discussion around this has been pretty lame. There's lots of low effort hyperbole that is getting upvoted that adds zero value (see the "why can't we have an expansion instead of Funko Pops" post today). Not much room for any nuance.
---
Ursanway!
---
Funny thing is you aren't wrong, it's the person that used 'earnings' that is wrong. He meant to say revenue...
---
Yes, this is correct, yet it still a decent source of gold whilst getting progression at the same time, In the end, getting trinkets alone will allow you to get into T2 towards T3 and as you slowly build from there it isn't too bad.
---
This is why some games value the rank in "solo queue" as that itself is the challenge and not just get a good group and do everything easily.
---
It's both casual less headache and potentially more challenging to the randomness of the groups and improved strategies. If you just make everything perfect it gets boring and unfun. The same does not happen in PvP because the enemy can adapt as well.
---
Re-read that bud. Never said he did.
---
My advice is don't try to marathon it. Don't try to catch up by the next big raid drop. Don't go insane and speedrun mode. Just take it easy. The moment you get into the horrible trap of thinking "Just _____ much time till I get to the proper endgame" you're fucked. I estimate 200ish hours to catch up to the current playerbase, based of skillups recent streams. However, keep in mind he had that twitch streamer boost (help from chat, etc).
---
Also, don't bother trying to do the harder trails/raids synced so you can experience them as they were at release. It's a trap. You'll never be able to. Also, don't try to take advantage of the daily roulette xp bonuses every day (you'll get too much XP and will start worrying about micromanaging multiple classes do and doing daily roulettes every day) Just make sure your main class is leveled for the story and that's it. Same advice applies to crafting.
---
There's also a trans npc in LA that exists to be the trans rep.
---
wow Aidan looks like a noble there
---
&gt;It's not good considering GW2 is ANet's primary source of earnings. 
---
Well, we don't know the details for what their internals are, we can't say how much money they need to consider this "successful." You're just making assumptions as to what they would need to keep running (and maybe you're assuming that their numbers would continue to drop indefinitely, even though they've been fairly stable).
---
iirc that "light at the end of the tunnel" referred to in the vidya was when they released the Founder's Packs. That is to say: A lot of money came in from the game's release. Well, "release" I guess since the whole process of publishing the game was kind of all over the place.
---
The game has definitely grown since then and there are a lot of factors as to why, but for the people here looking for a direct comparison: It was not from catering to their hardcore audience and adding more endgame / challenging content. In fact, over time, they reduced or removed challenging content.
---
lol, that was totally unintentional.
---
&gt;I know how helpless you are...when you fail to comprehend anything I said, and actually truly believe "raiders" only raid and are an isolated community.
---
I've never claimed that raiders only raid. That's just something *you've* said is *not* true several times. 
---
I'm well aware that raiders do other things.
---
But they still only make up a tiny tiny tiny portion of the community, so if all of them vanished over night, most people wouldn't notice, since the overwhelming majority of the community would still be there. 
---
&gt;I also know how helpless you are...when you continue using efficiency numbers, failing to comprehend the fact that it's invalid data because of multiple reasons, including the fact that not all accounts are active, nor main.
---
It's imperfect, but still the most accurate data we have to work with. If you have better numbers available, please share them. And most of the inaccuracies of Efficiency would tend to lean towards there being *less* raiders, not more, since there would be *massive* amounts of players who have never signed up on Efficiency, and those players would be much more likely to be casual non-raiders than they would to be hardcore raiders who would want to keep close track of their stats.
---
i dont think anet will respond to us anymore after 6 days they will just do what they always do hide their heads in the sands and pretend everything is good
---
The mount visual bug is driving me insane
---
You don't have to play them on a phone at all. Or tablet. I play most of my mobile games on BlueStacks or NoxApp. Both have extensive control mapping capabilities as well as controller and Mouse/Keyboard support. Playing on an actual phone is... not my idea of fun. But a lot of the games are actual games. *Not most by any means though*
---
Why is it still referred to as Path of Fire when the purchase includes both and the story has moved far past the PoF timeline?
---
Yea...although this is a super detailed post and i think its interesting as hell...its very unlikely those topics would be touched on for a variety of reasons (even though it would be sooo cool world building wise). The breeding farms in particular, although i love darker stories its probably best to view that one offhanded line from the event as non-canon as they would never deliver on it. And season 1 building isnt too likely since, well, season 1 isnt even in the game. Im super interested in anymore story on the flame legion though, groups like them and the nightmare court are so interesting considering the role they play in the early personal story, but are all but non-existent in the current story
---
&gt; Very few raid encounters have significant rng that can decide if you kill the boss or not.
---
I never made any point on that one way or the other. I just said that in general I am not a fan of RNG, in response to Zosin's assertion that I might favor "a random drop from the easiest event in the history of gw2."
---
That said, there is some *massive* RNG in raids, namely "is this group I found capable of clearing this encounter?" You can mitigate that, but only by having to be much more selective in forming a group, which has its own time and logistics challenges.
---
I agree, especially when you have a lot of software developpers.
---
Bacon glider - just in time for Cooking 500!
---
anet would be retarded to ban him for doing a community event with 17k viewers, just for using mods with no one cares about and noone gameplay is affected at all
---
It's totally opinionated, but I would say Holosmith.
---
It is literally free of downsides, with the exception I guess being overheating? 
---
Anyway, Holo is whack, it just has a bloated as hell kit.
---
Did anet remove keys from map completion rewards? it's been 17 maps since I got a key and I'm wondering if anyone has gotten one recently or if I just have the worst luck right now.
---
Delicious.
---
more like everyone is investing into mobile games now, where you can slack of, putting in much much less effort and resources and can milk and abuse games addictions much easier.
---
Deer me, that's an interesting glider choice.
---
&gt;	...or in-game gold
---
Which is kinda crazy when you think about it. I don't do much other gaming but the idea of a subscription-free game that lets you buy content with in-game currency has always struck me as pretty cool.
---
Add to that the fact that the gem store is all cosmetic and convenience rather than "you need to buy a weapon and armor with real money" and it's pretty easy to get into.
---
this is really helpful thanks
---
You're missing the point. Which is, their negativity is unnecessary. If it was prompted a constructive dialogue then sure. But it was just toxic for the sake of being toxic, which is an attitude all too common these days in the gaming community and needs to go away.
---
all opinions matter
---
If we're all so nostalgic about GW1, why don't we organize a special throwback weekend where we all play GW1 for a weekend? It could be fun!
---
I'm enjoying the drama, every year it's something new and around this time I guess. I haven't played since the roller beetle came out but I attribute that mostly to the fact that thief hasn't felt fun to play since they reworked deadeye (to me).
---
All the story in the world will not help me until my thief feels fun to play in at least most formats in one way or another and that looks like it isn't changing anytime soon.
---
i don't remember most of the straight characters either, guess i must hate straights *and* gays then. it's not as if poor writing had something to do with it
---
The Charr sure know how to party.
---
You should look at the picture, it's clearly stated there
---
Gotta get that &gt;!negative!&lt; karma ;)
---
ANet may well be responsible for not producing content for things like Raids and PvP that *meets the expectations of some players*, but they are not responsible for the shit storm surrounding the announcement. The announcement was clearly billed as a "sneak peek" at Season 5. And that's what it was with a minor nod or 2 to other forthcoming content.
---
At no point did they say (for example) they would be showcasing new elite specs. Or anything else some people on this sub decided they wanted. And yet they are being completely dismembered because of it. This is totally unfair and reflects badly on everyone who is involved.
---
People are unhappy about certain aspects of the game and have been for some time. I get that. This is clearly not a new thing. ANet then has a choice : address the concerns or don't. Followed by which the people with those concerns can make a choice : continue to support ANet and GW2 or not. None of that is in any way related to the announcement.
---
its not just software though.
---
Nothing surprises me anymore about anet and their moronic decisions, locking build templates behind legendary runes silgils and so on, is a sure fire way to keep killing the game, so off course, I expect them to think it is a brilliant, innovative idea.
---
I feel most of the presentation was dedicated to the 'story' aspect of the game, and I do not hope that most of their people are working on this aspect. I hope their focus is less on making content to be consumed and more about making old as well as new content consumable in new ways.
---
Keys still drop. It’s a 20-25% chance per map, with only a few exceptions. City zones never drop keys. Southsun Cove never drops keys. LS3 and LS4 zones completed by characters under level 80 never drop keys. 
---
Going 17 maps that can drop keys without getting one is highly unlikely, but not impossible. Such is RNG.
---
I agree, this is one of the biggest benefits of bundling previous expansions with the latest. 
---
Now if we could only get some of the seasons bundled as well to make it easier. I still think Season 2 should come with any Deluxe edition at this point.
---
Would also be funny what newer players will of the supposively extremely difficult HoT maps.
---
With an almost completely horizontal progression, you won't find big upgrades to your gear. There is somewhat of a vertical progression to get from exotic gear to ascended gear. There's also a vertical progression in fractals given the agony resistance which later on will give you stats. (+9 compared to none, per ascended slot with 6 in armor, 2 in weapon, 2 in back, 6 in rings, 2 in accessory; that's 18\*9 stats increase; WvW gives max +5 so even there you have a slight advantage stat-wise compared to those who don't do fractals or raids) It's just mix maxing, but that's the best you will see.
---
Legendary gear gives you the advantages to easily change your stats. Quality of life, which tbh is awesome in such a game.
---
Assuming you don't have HoT buying PoF will give you gliding everywhere (except for certain instances or areas such as jumping puzzles) as well as mounts with each one being unique in its abilities and uses (unlike any other game). So more mobile, vertically, horizontally, above water or in air. You will also get new stat combinations that might be more or less useful (diviners vs plaguedoctor). Also raids, where you get said infusions or legendary armor (QoL and/or stat increase).
---
There's also a fractal grind (for fractal god) that gives you quite strong advantages inside of the fractals only. (health per second, increased damage, more agony resistance, etc.)
---
The philosophy is not to have an advantage over others but to be able to beat different encounters and have all encounters and all areas of the game still relevant from a mechanical difficulty (horizontal progression is mechanical; you get better thus having an indirect vertical player progression)
---
I hope that helps.
---
Oh man, I couldn't stomach the comments that it gets better. I couldn't stomach them so bad I gave up LOL about halfway through the second expansion. The advice I gave you (or anyone reading that) was what I would have told myself if I didn't want to burn out.
---
The little suggestions you have would be nice, but really the problem is the sheer quantity of story content you have to plow through (remember, 200 hours or so). Now, I don't actually think it's the best shit ever, it's kinda medium, but it can be enjoyable if you're not pushing yourself.
---
You already sound kind of aggravated. I'd take a two-three month break to be honest, it's what I'm doing, and it actually has helped, I am now looking foward to resubbing fairly soon.
---
Also, yeah four man is 1 tank 1 healer and 2 dps, the good news is that most harder content is 8 man, which you'll find yourself spending more time in later. Also, leveling up your other classes really is nowhere as bad as your first later on once you have access to more roulettes (and there's a shitton more types, it's why I said try not to focus on doing all of them daily, you'll overlevel). 
---
Again, the biggest hurdle is the story length and it is possible to sit back and enjoy it, especially later. Just think of it (it being the leveling process) as a mediocre JRPG with excellent music, and pace yourself accordingly.
---
The game isn't about gear giving advantage over other players, but knowing your character inside and out, plus rotation (in pve) to maximize dps.  Skill over gear.  All game modes are more than button mashing.  ANet has said that good players do 5x the dps as bad players.  DPS meters are allowed so use that for your motivation.
---
Phew, thought I was the only one.. Thank you for sharing!
---
It gave me a Marionette vibe in motion from the trailer, I'm guessing it's some kind of event big fight thing
---
They don't drop from city maps or living world (when below 80), otherwise just bad luck as the rate is ~30%
---
It's all good but since it's just conjectures mine are equally valid.
---
What are the units on the graph? I'm assuming that it's not $20,000 over 3 months
---
That is the point of those games though. Diablo 3, warframe and diablo 2 plays the same. I don't like it too but it is how it is.
---
FYI, every class is shit tier until you hit 50-60. If you've played gw2 or any other MMO, lv1-60 is piss easy mode. It sucks. After that you get to the good stuff.
---
The backlash you see on reddit is representative of at most a tiny, tiny slice of the playerbase. I doubt it will have as much impact as people seem to think.
---
I think what classic wow is doing for a lot of the WoW community is showing how far the game has departed from its roots. 
---
So some of the community is saying “wow this is really clunky bfa is so smooth” and other people are saying “I miss a lot of the quality of life upgrades from retail.” But both camps end up saying “this is so weirdly entertaining.” In the end gamers love to be challenged. Story is great and all but a lot of gamers stay for the challenge. We will complain about the grind but we still do it, if there’s no challenge you are left with nothing and that’s what WoW has lost it’s just gotten too easy. 
---
What I’m hoping classic WoW does is encourage new developers to make MMOs that are challenging and not full of quality of life systems that cheapen the challenge of the game. I have high hopes for games like Pantheon Rise of the fallen and other similar titles in the future. Hopefully we are done with the Korean port money grab phase of the genera.
---
Speak up. The worst you can get is downvotes. It's not like you can transfer reddit karma to in game karma. You can't spend it. It's pretty much meaningless. It's just an arbitrary number. Plenty of my posts get downvoted.  Not like I'll miss my next meal because of it.
---
Most of their stuff arnt worth buying tho. I seriously doubt much of their income comes from the cash shop. Unlike gw2, you get lots of nice mount skins in ffxiv and there's no loitboxes for whales to spend on.
---
If you don't like the subreddit, just leave.
---
That's what people keep telling me to do about the game at least!
---
... believe me... No one wants those Funko Pops.
---
HoT had a bad reaction exactly because it was a first xpack, tbh. If PoF had come out first, and then HoT came out unchanged, people would've liked HoT a lot better.
---
By inflation alone they should be on an increasing 4 quarter cycle. Instead their revenue always slips away until another expansion, except for a slight hype tick when expansion is announced. Someone reading that would say "the past tells us we need to launch another expansion." Yet they aren't launching another expansion. Why aren't they? Because it isn't worth it to do, or because they have better ways to make money? If we saw quarterlys rising after PoF that might mean they've got a stable way to make money. But they're not really. So it looks like Anet doesn't want to invest in a new expansion. Which implies that the graph as it looks isn't good enough. Another way to look at it is constantly falling revenues only punctuated by expansions. And now they're not putting an expansion down. 
---
I'm not carefully articulating it all but that's the gist of it.
---
You get an advantage over other players by getting better at the game. Learning your class. Practicing with your class. I never understood why people want their power to come from gear. Is your highest aspiration to be a coatrack for greatness?
---
The things you're complaining about are precisely the reason I'm here.
---
&gt;but they are not responsible for the shit storm surrounding the announcement.
---
Considering the 48 hour hype countdown clock, booking out a theater, and hyping the announcement for a month leading up to it, they are *absolutely* at fault for having such a shitty announcement that was well below community expectations for the amount of hype they built.
---
Stop blaming the fucking community for the grave ANet dug themselves.
---
Perfect for Meatober Fest
---
As a now apathetic, formerly frustrated veteran, you're not wrong about the "meeting their needs", but I don't understand why people don't just leave and play that does instead of trying to get a brick wall to accept criticism. I'd like to enjoy this game, but if I can't, I'm just going to move on.
---
Yet they're complaining in the face of new content, hmmmmm
---
Good catch, lol. Thanks
---
No, Aion is the only game soinf worse
---
and new mount skins
---
That’s “content?”
---
Can some explain to me why we are suppose to be proud?
---
I want the aurene one for gf and the joko one for me
---
Can you give some insight/details into what are the main boost and hurdles you have encountered?  ie. Was most of this from gem store purchases?  Other than pure curiosity,  I am at 92% and I have been having a really hard time breaking free from that percentage.  I think due to me only on rare occasions every buying anything from the gem store.  I also am not sure how some items are calculated like black lion scraps weapons due to only being dropped from black lion chests .  Either way AWESOME!  Congratulations X2!
---
The style of the logo is great.
---
Good meme. Anet really is just going to try to ignore the community outcry, aren’t they?
---
Banners and spotter are actually stronger than just "kinda nice". That is because all the high end builds that most raiders run build around having the extra precision from spotter and banners. At the end of the day, yes, you dont need 100% crit, but most pug groups and many statics will simply prefer druid to anything else and not really want to work around a "subpar" healer.
---
&gt; I would say that the fact there is 18-19 LS maps, and nearly all are vacant, even during prime time.
---
Well, the issue there is that there *are* 18-19 maps, they spread out very thin. Populations tend to mostly focus on the more recent ones. They're also very large in scale, so you don't get a real picture for how many people are in each one. I know when I was farming up for Skyscale mats I was seeing plenty of other people doing the same. Is every map packed? No. Is that a bad thing? I don't think so. 
---
&gt;Even despite all this, Desert Borderlands sees more player action than all of the LS maps.
---
By what measure? Just your own anecdotal impressions, or do you have some metric for that? Besides which, GW2 maps are split up, so we don't know how many instances of a given map are active at any given time. Even if the map you are on is relatively empty, there might be several mostly-filled copies running.
---
&gt;You also have to keep in mind here, the WvW population is a mere fraction of the PvE population, yet the most hated map sees more action than any LS map at any time. 
---
Again though, you have to consider the above factors, and that there are far fewer WvW maps in total for people to be on. I would fully *expect* individual WvW maps to be more crowded than most PvE maps, given the wider variety available to PvE players. 
---
&gt; People's measures of success may be different but I certainly don't consider cash flow a measure of success, especially if everyone walks away after.
---
Well, cash flow would certainly be ANet's measure of success. For the player's it's just a solid secondary metric, since if people are spending money, then they must be enjoying the game enough to care about what they can get there. Bad sales figures don't necessarily mean that people hate the game (they might just hate the store products), but good sales have to mean that a reasonable amount of players really enjoy the game.
---
&gt;I look at the current content, and I see how it's played, and this is what I see: The HoT metas see more action than any Living story or PoF map for that matter. If the Living Story maps aren't played regularly, I personally have to call them a failure.
---
Why do they need to be played regularly though? Would it not be a success if players played them for a while, ENJOYED playing them over that time, and then moved to something else? I mean, there aren't enough hours in the day. I wonder if anyone has done this, tried to do EVERY meta event, dungeon, raid, etc. in the game once in a consecutive sequence. It would probably take hundreds of hours, and most of those things you can do at least once per day for full awards, multiple times for lesser reward. There's no sin in players choosing which of these things they prefer to be doing with their time, and just because someone spent a dozen or more hours playing around in a new map, but then went back to a previous one or moved on to a new one, that does not mean that map failed to live up to its purpose. 
---
Just as an example, I haven't been back to Ember Bay in like a year or two at this point, but I still think it was a great area to have in the game, I enjoyed the time I spent there, I enjoyed the story missions, the collections, the new game mechanics it added, the new environments. It was all fun to me, and I believe that's true for a lot of players.
---
*blinks* hot damn sir
---
Shit post.
---
I bought this tough....
---
I always kept away from gemstore stuff because I didn't like spending money that could be bought with gold. Main hurdles we're definitely taking the time to learn to trade and not just half assing it. I was top 99% before I stopped playing and then dropped down after the expansion 3 years ago but came back every now and then to work on this project. If you want to get into the top 99% again you honestly can't take long breaks from the game because new updates will come out and crash the value of items on your account. I don't think black lion scraps are calculated on efficiency.
---
You will be downvoted into oblivion, but you speak the truth.
---
What I am curious about is the two expansion releases.
---
It could be that their motivation for not doing more expansions is based on how "small" the bump in income was. Sure, &gt;2x, but consider how much effort must have gone into these expansions, they probably made a net loss on them.
---
They're still important to keep customers engaged of course, but it could be upper management changed the plan because of comparatively weak sales.
---
Yeah, let me just say... "Garden Plots".
---
Don't stand in the rift when the countdown ends.
---
I wonder which years there were expansions.....
---
Totally! Woe is me, I've truly found my match in your heroic hunt against my dark lies and subterfuge.
---
*sigh*
---
The world is lesser for it. But maybe it's better this way.
---
Thanks for the update, mate.
---
&gt;build diversity as Diablo
---
Highly disagree, 95% of "builds" are centered around just spamming one skill with a whole stat setup to delete the screen.
---
Atleast in Diablo skills rely on more than one skill in general and are more diverse.
---
Also the skill tree in PoE is horrendous in my opinion and way too convoluted and more complex to understand than it has any right to be.
---
How is your post any more positive than the posts you're complaining about?
---
What you're saying everyday language.  In finance, the example you meant to give is revenue, not earnings.  So if you spend $10 and make a profit of $10, that means your revenue is something like $20.
---
Ya. While I don't agree about the story being bad, the heavy template is obvious. But it feels that is what they think is "new". *"I need new maps and new story to keep the content relevant"*, *"We can't stop delivering what is expected to focus on other things"*, *"We can't reutilize assets and update stuff so let's work on a template for "new" things*".
---
And with this, they miss the mark completely.
---
Sigh it is not. Not enough people do them to move more resources to develop them faster.and no they are not easy or interesting enough to move people to them or there won't be so many post on how to raid
---
Can we talk about how the presenters laughed at the one pvp guy in the audience. Yes, PvP is as abandoned or worse as WvW, but that was completely inappropriate time to laugh at your dedicated fan.
---
I 've been playing PvE and PvP since pre-launch, and I was shocked at their laughing of the fan.
---
It does not help that they are throwing low quality rewards now to PvP such as terrible armor that is surpassed by core gear you can already get from PvP reward tracks...
---
now i see that  11 MILIONS STRONG.
---
Based on their earning it seems totally reasonable to stop making expansions. If you can put qualit content and raise the earnings to about 20k then that would be really good.
---
Yeah remember that you're compensating 9 other people for their time, consumables, and for their effort at learning literally the hardest content in the game. They're going to expect at minimum 100g each for Dhuum CM (which does get you the skin you're after), maybe more, i think 1000 mystic coins is the current price.
---
I say: "arena net take my money" but it is a fan web lol
---
Thanks for the reply.  Excellent comment.
---
The thing about the story is that the Personal Story was awesome.   It's what came after that has been a bit of a let down.  They really need to move away from the plot twists and focus more on interesting character (e.g. Tybalt).
---
well,they selling bags,bank slots,char slots,new mounts,new outfits all in quick succesion,it will drop in week or two.
---
Raid golem is just stupid rotation nothing exceptional. I do T4 every day is it enough? Show .e your dps log. This is the question people receive when they want to raid.
---
This is one of the problem
---
 Let them have a raid with a suboptimal equip and have fun .oh no they can't they must have the Optima equip and do the exact rotation
---
What if they hate alacrity revenant for example cause it is pointless alone during farming ? They can do another character
---
Bah I got bored of this conversation u understood the point but still keep on insisting on how they should adapt to raid and not the opposite
---
It's worth getting in to if you are brand new.
---
There is a lot of content if you are just starting out, but the game's future isn't particularly bright right now.
---
Biggest part of THAT boat was about hard-end content, as a new player you have a lot ahead of you to keep you hook for a while!
---
Also, isn't it really weird/convenient how every time this subreddit is at all negative towards ANet, a bunch of these threads get posted, and are inevitably flooded with people going "The game is fine! Ignore all those people who have legitimate concerns!"?
---
At least yoshi p confirmed they will revisit and trim thw 1-50 msq so theres that.
---
Tho im curious, i was under the impression ff11 was the grindy one, at least at endgame ff14 seems fairly tame on grind.
---
Dont let the drama keep you from having fun, you of thousands of hours of content before you to enjoy, what is happening on this subreddit right now is only affecting the veteran players but also not all of them
---
Hi, I recommend reading this thread  
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cz61c5/looking\_to\_begin\_playing\_gw2\_but\_looking\_at\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cz61c5/looking_to_begin_playing_gw2_but_looking_at_this/)
---
Thanks, very helpful!
---
That's the joke
---
weird shitpost
---
This is spot on. Indeed take it slow and try to invest yourself in the story. Don't ever skip a cutscene or dialogue or the story will make no sense.
---
People should also take a look at how the gem store changed over the time. What things could you buy in the first few years compared to now? They try new promotions and add new types of items all the time and the [amount of mount skins they have released so far](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mount#Mount_skins) is astonishing.
---
I can't say it for sure but I think the amount of players went down but the average user spending increased. Maybe more people buy things now, maybe whales have more to buy now or maybe it's both of these things.
---
Im not really big into story but I have finished every storyline in gw2 atleast once. Personal story was BY FAR the worst story I have ever experienced in any game ever. However I fell like the story aspect of the game has steadily improved since that time to a decent level.
---
Teapot reached acceptance, even when he was talking with others about it afterwards (namely bik) you could see his position felt distanced.
---
I'm taking donations. (:
---
That chart isn't made by NCSoft.  It's made by someone using NCSoft's numbers.  That person incorrectly label it.
---
Of course outside people factor in, not only do they factor in they're essentially the only people that matter. Let me ask you this, why do you think people engage in Hyperbole? is it to convince people who love the game that they're wrong? That will not work like you said we can easily see through the hyperbole, if some says new maps are dead within a month, we know thats not true, we play in old maps even in once that have been released years ago and we know you always come across people no matter the time you visit those maps. Would a statement claiming gw2 forces you to spend 200-300 bucks a month on its cash shop work? Of course not I dont even spend 200 bucks a year on the cash shop, doubt i spent 300 bucks on the cash shop since launch actually ( full disclosure: I did buy the collectors edition of the game and each expansion though so am only talking about cash shop spending here) . Do people engage in hyperbole to convince people who feel like them? no they already feel like that, they dont need convincing at all! so why do people engage in hyperbole? seems to me the only plausable reason is to put pressure on Anet, "do as what we say or we'll scare of your future customers". We know old maps still have players but people who dont yet play the game dont. When they see 100s if not 1000s of people all claiming that maps are death within a month of release, you're not going to dismiss that as hyperbole, you're going to believe it and will you spend money to buy a game thats death? No, no one would and thats the power/issue with hyperbole. This is all about outsiders!
---
Predatory business model?  Now isnt that hyperbole as well? Dont get me wrong I am not saying their cash shop is perfect but I will say its the least predatory of any MMO that I am aware of that doesnt include a mandatory subscription. And to be clear in my opinion Gw2 is way way cheaper to play then a game with a mandatory sub even if their cashshop could be described as more "predatory".
---
Here is the thing Gw2 cashshop predatory nature is tappered down a lot compared to the competition. Yes they got loot boxes but they entirely cosmetic and convience. Secondly you can accesss those lootboxes without spending any real money something that a real preditory business model wouldnt really do! With mounts they went even further not only you can access them exclusively by playing the game, no real money involved, but they also made it so you dont get duplicates... again not very predatory. Even more, they made most items tradeable. Like a new weapon set well buy the piece you want out right no need to go through lootboxes if you dont want to. That ability isnt exactly predatory is it?
---
Thing is most of us played other MMOs we know what predatory means. We know how other cashshops use p2w tactices to keep you spending money. Every single piece of gear can be upgrades to level 15, but anything above level 7 risks loosing the gear if the event of a failed upgrade but fear not we sell insurance stones in the cash shop and you want that insurance stone cause getting the BIS gear isnt easy you dont want it go poof as you try to level it to 8, never mind 15 there is no way to get there without the insurances stones. Next year be prepaired to buy those 100s of insurance stones all over again cause we'll get a new BiS gear set and you'll need it to remain competitive. Thats what predatory cash shops look like, its not loot boxes that you can open by playing the game or even by pass entirely as you can buy most of their contents directly off the auction house. So no 200-300 bucks a month isnt close to the truth, I am actually sceptic about if its even possible to spend that much cause $700 gives you all the loot box mounts which leaves the blc. Admittingly there is no limit on spending there but the only thing of value that changes is generally the weapon sets that are introduced every 2 months on average and you can outright buy those for 30g a piece off the auction house for a total of 480g which at current gold conversion would be a little over $20 (every 2 months) then you got outfits of which there are 92 takes $800 to buy all those. There are 75 gliders which cost $375 to buy all of them, say a full set of infinite gathering tools for 5 characters  $560, 9 mount packs -&gt; $180, 13 exclusive mounts -&gt; $330. Litterally if someone were to purchase all of the cometics ever it would cost $2250ish 
---
which over 7 years comes to about $30 a month + the new weapon set every 2 month would bring that to $40 a month (since as we said its around $20 every 2 months) Thats no where close to $200 a month and its with buying everything which no one really needs to do (of course this is assuming you're playing since day 1) if you just joined you can most certainly spend $300 bucks in a month but then it would be decietful to claim you spend $300 each month if you've been at it for only a few months and maybe its worth pointing out that even then with $300 a month you'd end up buying everything in less then 6 months (not all the things I mentioned are available for sale all the time!) 
---
Yeah I stand by my statement I dont see how anyone could possibly spend $200 a month. Even $50 a month is stretching it in my opinion.
---
Every race has the same hitbox, so the size of your character model does not matter.
---
i remember time,when you could glide ONLY in HOT maps...
---
obviously not because the thing keeps falling.
---
It‘s not a bad time to come to GW2, only into this subreddit. But when is it ever
---
Haha good luck
---
Honestly, they've been there *every* *day* that I've sorted by new.  Just normally they ask "Should I play despite it being an older game?" instead of "Should I play despite the negativity?".  90% of the time they are answered by a couple of people, then die or get deleted by mods.
---
There are a few more right now, but not more than usual for this type of announcement/promotion.  I mainly think they are getting more attention/responses due to the reddit being on edge these past few days.
---
Which Q&amp;A are you referring to? this is Anets [announcement](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/join-us-for-a-special-live-event-on-august-30/) of the event ont their official site, no mention of a Q&amp;A. Just in case they're trying to be sneaky I even double checked it with the internet archive wayback machine... page never changed. Did they announcement somewhere there was going to be a Q&amp;A and then just didnt do it? cause honestly I am not aware of any such promise, a link to it would be appreciated.
---
Its not just mounts that make all maps relevant, I have a feeling a lot of people underestimate what rewards are included in those maps. Like when I finished by requiem set which you get from jahai bluffs I was messaged by 4 or 5 people asking where I got that from. (admitting a very small number of people in the grand scheme of things but yet never happened for other gear pieces before). There are even some extremely useful gizmos to get like the prototype position rewinder which you can get from Sandswept Isles... awesome for jumping puzzles. People often act like once you've done the story there is no reason to replay any of these maps beyond mounts, thats not true, there are plenty of rewards to be had, skins, ascended equipment, minis, utilities, gizmos etc...
---
I'm sorry you're going to be very disappointed in life if you think you're just going to get thousands of hours of entertainment from whatever you like. 
---
It would cost more in just shoes to go jogging for 2000 hours let alone appropriate clothes and that's about the cheapest hobby possible besides gaming. 
---
Good luck out there
---
Honestly if the writers were taking a shit, this would be news, but the story-wise, the game is doing mighty fine. Meaning, it's not troubling or anything. She jump ship, that's up to her. Now if you have someone working on raids, wvw leave - that's when the community rolls the eyes
---
&gt; So I've been looking for a chill MMORPG
---
You are at the right place, and welcome! You'll find most of the community in-game to be extremely helpful and nice. That's probably also true of the one here on reddit. Drama is end-game on reddit...
---
It changes annually, and I don't think we had a solid idea after the layoffs.
---
Only one that I know of off the top of my head at this point is Bobby Stein.
---
Sorry the last time I watch these cartoons were 2003 I feel old.
---
In 6 months from now the only thing that will change is 1 or 2 new episodes of living world. Nothing will change for the game as a whole.
---
Damn 20k+ hours. You aren't a veteran anymore. You're a full blown war hero that isn't missing any tour xD I thought my 4.5k was much lol
---
Keep on rocking out :)
---
Well weird flex. Grats tho. If we compared RL money tho haha I'm kidding
---
It probably isn't :), but I think 2-3 additional LS mastery lines is a bit generous estimation. There is significant overflow yes, but I have most HoT things done and even still I opted not to grab the final abilities for some mastery lines (namely itzel and Nuhoc IIRC) because they are so expensive and I'd actually have to get good at adventures to get the points needed at this point after maxing out ancient magics.
---
Unless you are going for HoT legendaries the final abilities simply are not worth it, sans leyline gliding obviously.
---
No talk no relationship simple as that.
---
Learn your customer, run your business - not the other way around.
---
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's bad.
---
Used to play pixel art games on Atari for years. Current mobile games are much better looking with much more complicated game mechanics, also some of them are quite fun.
---
Yeah, the market is filled with money grab shitty games, so is Steam. I don't see people bashing on that. Your irrational hatred doesn't do shit.
---
It's really the grind to GET to the endgame that's the issue. To even get to the first expansion you gotta do ARR and then complete 100 quests. Plus the game is super unfriendly to alts. I want to love FFXIV but GW2 is markedly better
---
I think the crystals that shoot out are projectiles, so you can actually catch them before they reach the circles.
---
I try to stand a little closer to the rift they fly out of, then jump right before they reach me so I don't get knocked back.
---
For that event you also have to be facing the direction the projectile is coming from, and not be using any skills.
---
Season 3 complete pack isn't appearing for me either , S2 did and so did S4 . I have no idea why i S3 complete pack refuses to show up .
---
As a side note , the free HoT t-shirt outfit also does not appear in the store for me .
---
There’s definitely way more builds than just the one button ones
---
Are you sure it works like that? I know the prices fluctuate but I'm not aware of the ability to buy order vs buy-now gems. I didn't think it was actually buying and selling player to player. It reflects supply and demand but that's anets choice too.
---
Never had a problem with catching the thingies and I’m on SEA 350ms latency, provided there’s no other players in the circle with me because I will always lose, lag wise. There was a charr lowbie pug doing the event too and he had no problem catching the stuff.
---
Guess, it's for those weirdos who are too sensitive to anything that resembles meat lol
---
More like 1 month playing an hour or two a day in those 3 years. I was/am pretty inactive.
---
I think you're missing my point. People DO say the story is the draw as you suggest but they also say it's only really great in the expansions. So to get to the "good" part of the story you have to beat the entire ARR campaign then do 100 quests. You have to get where the endgame was pre expansion. That's a huge grind. It's like how GW2 story didn't get good until HoT but you can't skip the story or 100 quests like you can skip Zhaitan in GW2
---
We've both grown, I was a pretty toxic person as well, hell for most of season 4 I'd written off the game because of all the negativity I bought into regarding Reaper balance changes, the whole PVE Meta toxic back and forth a between the loudest people in the room such as the Elitists and the Hard Core Casuals like my self.
---
I'm just enjoying the game for what it is now with no expectations beyond new Open World content every 2 to 3 months.
---
There is no need to repeat it 40 times, we all know. But please stop trying to excuse them, they have plenty of money to do anything if they wanted to. They are just greedy pigs that only want money and don't do anything that doesn't guarantee profits
---
good old voltaic spear farming with ursan blessing
---
Agree on everything, but going to be pedantic about one thing... LWS5 is still a \_season\_ of Living World, but the title is \_The Icebrood Saga\_. Just like we had LWS1 \_Scarlet's War\_, etc. "Saga" is just part of the season's name, I don't get why people are hung up on it not being called season any longer, because I don't see anything has changed in that regard.
---
Maybe I'll check it out, what's the viewing order since theres the original movie, this series and I think there was at least another Netflix DC project prior to this series?
---
Yes and no. Yes there are jumps with every new season where there is an increase in concurrent players that falls off towards the end. However Poe is also consistently growing, with every new season currently breaking the record for concurrent players.  I remember a year or two back when I was impressed Poe season had 40k on steam, now every season is reaching over 100k players on steam (can't check totals as that would include standalone client)
---
oh no
---
There's just the series and the movie, and you can watch them in either order. The other project you mention was "Power of the Dark Crystal" - but that never got released.
---
atm https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Widget:Account_recipes combines account and character-bound recipes
---
I could add a dropdown box to select on a per-character basis or all. Not sure how useful that widget is if it doesn't tell you which character has it
---
https://imgur.com/TOH4r6W
---
Maybe you find an angel investor. In any case, I wish you best of luck!
---
That would be terrible for balance and unfair for each class that has to wait.
---
If they go the Season route forever then ANet should do what Rift did and release paid DLCs for each new set of Elite Specs, maybe at 20 dollars a set.
---
&gt; Adding a Public Test Server could make major updates easier to deliver as the player base “work for free”. 
---
Only useful if they actually assign people to fix the issues that get reported. Considering how even issues in the live game get reported and ignored I doubt a public server will make any difference.
---
No. of active players is not available publicly

I was literally responding to someone talking about "one of the worst writings in gaming history"...
---
It is not particularly difficult to manipulate sell prices to arbitrarily raise the sell liquid gold stat, all you need to have is a lot of an uncommon item that has a very high sell price, but it doesn't mean that anyone will buy it.
---
Account value actually has some checks for extreme sell values after the last time someone has done this (and it cost them a lot of gold to get a meaningless stat for a day), but those can be bypassed as well.
---
Given that the buy liquid gold value (the actual gold you'd get if you instantly sold everything) is cropped, I doubt it's anywhere near. So, just curious, how much is it?
---
Hmm maybe they'll make use of the 4th lane in Dragon's Stand and we can finally have a conclusion to the Nightmare Court/Malyck side story.
---
 It's done, I pre-ordered :D
---
I feel.the same way half of my characters are Reapers (seriously I have 5 of them, one for each race), and i have 2 Hammer Dragon Hunters a Human and Norn (original main).

---
Then why did you focus on the gay characters?
---
What are you using to measure your account value? Inspect element? GW2 Efficiency has the top account valued at only 2.9M gold.
---
Evergreens like bank slots, character slots, bag slots. That alone burns gems like charcoal.
---
Add to that, like you said, Bonds, which are absolutely fucking CRAZY in terms of gem value as well as the current New Frontiers (or whatever) Package and it's easy to see why everyone and their mum is throwing their gold at the gem conversation.
---
i'm trying to watch dark crystal, and while i loved the movie and grew up watching the muppets, i guess i'm too old to like muppets anymore. i cant take it seriously.
---
but i think youre right, there are similarities that have borrowed from the same fantasy genre
---
I'm in complete shock that everyone believed one picture. This is complete fake.
---
**Where r proofs?** 
---
1. Where is your acc name for us to find you on gw2effiiency?
---
2. Where is you and your acc walue in leaderbord?
---
3. Where is video proof of you serfing gw2efficiency with detailed information of what your acc have and what it doesn't and walue in each category?
---
There is leaderboard as picture:  [https://i.redd.it/838t1bprzik31.png](https://i.redd.it/838t1bprzik31.png), as link [https://gw2efficiency.com/account/statistics/values.summary.valueMinusGemItems](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/statistics/values.summary.valueMinusGemItems).
---
Dunno why the downvotes, all of this is 100% true
---
amazing, thx!
---
Keep in mind that if you ever do own a Permanent Bank Contract, most shared inventory slot items can just live in your bank.
---
I don't see any reason to haul around the Gleam or Ley-Converter when you already have easy bank access through Mistlock.
---
Storage expansion is nice for TP flipping to save some bank space.  Also *very* handy for building legendary items.
---
I would stick with your original plan, especially with the inflated Gem prices.  You can always buy the Shared slots later, and probably pay close to the same price in gold.
---
Cos its a fake.
---
is this from the trailer?
---
Steven universe and scarlett can both suck madsive jotun coo, quaggan is happy to see you.
---
yes and thats exactly the point of the critic.  
---
(and specifically here that /u/Nikeli said that earnings are not profits.)
---
Dont worry it's a gemstore bug it will be fixed fast
---
I just saw the elite spec icons and creamed myself. You're a legend, this was wonderfully done. At first I thought it was real!
---
*laughs in reaper shroud 4*
---
Need a Fire Skimmer to finish my fire theme.
---
Come on anet!
---
Until you remember why it only received a smaller team. Because Anthem. Then you realize Andromeda wasn't so bad. Lmao
---
I also really liked the cooking side quest.  As you pointed out, it isn't super practical, and for that reason, I would say maybe it shouldn't have been too high a priority.  
---
As for build templates, I think we should wait to judge them after we actually get them, or at the very least give us some information about them.  As of now, they have literally, not given us any details about how they will work.  We are completely blind here.
---
Think some tumblr queen is downvoting everybody.   
---
This post is also very sound and correct, steven universe suffers from a bad case of wasted potential. As the episodes went on it was more about queerbaiting than the actual story of the cartoon resulting in very sub-par content.
---
This would be a good start:
---
[https://www.artstation.com/artwork/ybEkex](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/ybEkex)
---
how many cc swipes?
---
I know this
---
Low effort af
---
We know.
---
graven makes solid points, and I’d definitely agree with this advice. You already had a good plan to begin with, and it should do you well in the long run. :)
---
I would not say that completely white is beautiful but everyone has a different taste.
---
I think it's super funny I came across  your question like 2 hours after watching episode 4 of the Dark Crystal series.
---
Hubby and I was watching the 3rd episode of Dark Crystal series and the town where Deet and Hup stopped in - Stonewood village, hubby asked if I got a Slyvari vibe when Hup was looking at the wooden area for drinks...I said Sho' euff!!
---
So to answer your question- Yes! :)
---
Or .... playing another game.
---
&gt; If you just make everything perfect it gets boring and unfun
---
That's not the case for everyone.
---
f*ck HoT maps. For real. They are a pain in the ass to navigate, and it's obviously content you should be doing in group. Except no one's doing the content except for the meta event.
---
Its just this way whenever Anet announces something or doesnt announce something.
---
The game is great. Still pretty much playing everyday.
---
Usually standing in front of the circle rather than on the circle will put you directly on the trajectory of the projectile and you'll grab it easily. You can also jump before the projectile reaches you to deny the knockback.
---
Just wait for a sale.
---
If you're looking for a chill MMO, nothing being said will affect you. This is mostly the hardest core people looking for harder content, not something to log in, kill some stuff, get some rewards, do some farming. For that, this MMO is about as chill as you can get.
---
I actually think it's cool. It's not super easy to dye but can be fitting, [especially on Sylvari] (https://i.imgur.com/wr4ve76.png)!
---
Also useful for rp GM's. As a GM in my guild, i could never assume that every player could have access to those maps. Also, every player now has full access to the Guild hall features unless on a free account.
---
But not the bug where Anet can't talk about our concerns?
---
None of what you suggested was "introduce more raids quicker". All you said about raids was, "Call them strike missions, don't call them raids" as if people are inherently AFRAID of the word raid. 
---
YES, introducing a 100 raids would fix the problem for a lot of pve players but that's kind of a blanket statement because it doesn't actually mean very much. How would they devote more time and manpower to raids? By moving people away from the living story or getting rid of the personal dedicated to the living story and hiring people to work on end-game pve content if they have a contingency on how many people work for anet. It's not simply just "GIVE ME MORE RAIDS".
---
Yes, fractals are fine. T4 fractals are the single most repeated content in this game by everyone, casuals and hardcore players, and most people log in to do them and then log off. 
---
I mean, you're clearly casually playing pvp because otherwise, you wouldn't say "More balance updates AND skill splitting. All elite specs should be viable at the high-end competitive level". Anyways, it's too big an issue to tackle here so I'll just say, try to play more of the game before you make a post that attempts to be comprehensive because it just spreads ignorance.
---
Horrible UI
---
Why making guild halls worthwile when they fan sell you a vip pass instead?
---
Look at the marbling on that thing!
---
I remember it so well as a teen, as that area was where I first learnt the benefits of solo pulling.
---
If they put in a small map with enough lore, intersting ambient things, nice landscape and tell us that the first real episode comes in October-November then I'm absolutely fine with it even if it won't have quests, meta events.
---
From a player perspective: Absolutely.
---
From Anet's perspective: Too many services in the guild hall conflict with special area passes, wich would hurt their monetization.
---
If they make more maps like Verdant Brink or Bloodstone Fen I am all for it. All PoF and LS4 maps, except Dragonfall, has been rather flat.
---
you can literally google the term what is mmo skilling on google and get the exact response I gave you. Well said because the whole point is gw2 has no real skilling since it is all crafting. Yes it is the correct term, widely used in mmorpg reddit and even runescape for goodness sake. I do understand gw2/was a gw1 vet and gw2 early beta player who has prob put more hours into this game than most.   C yah
---
Yes
---
Could i get season at a later date after ive finished the base game and expansions ?
---
Majority of the hard-core Raiders have left for other games.
---
The races all share the same hitbox size. It's harder to judge where it actually is on Charr, but the game sees you exactly the same as the smallest Asura.
---
Thats beautiful! Very nice :D
---
Oh, thanks so much for this :) 
---
To be honest, we just tried to find the best routes for mesmer to get the best possible strategies - it was hell to search the skips, get the right skill order (so that everything is on cd again when needed next) and to actually record decent runs, then edit, upload etc... i dont feel like going through this any time near again for other classes where times will presumably not improve since i cant think about any class that could do it faster currently :D
---
I however challange anyone to do quicker runs of any of the JPs :)
---
True. The HoT maps were designed on the assumption that 1. You wouldn't have Gliding maxed at first, but 2. you *would* have gliding maxed by the end of it, so the critical paths tend to not require more than basic gliding, but plenty of secrets do require it. With the PoF LS maps, they seem to *mostly* be designed to not require any flight method, since the Griffon is expensive/complex enough that I guess they can't assume you'd have one. At least now they can assume *basic* gliding capability. 
---
Oh, I just realized, any time a PoF-only player got hit with a "knock up" ability, they had no way of recovering from that. Wow.
---
I thought GW2 was the sequel ;)
---
I get it sort of the difference between Star Wars the Old Republic and the Star Wars Movie Saga.
---
To be honest while the expansions do look like they brought in less money, anet need some better telemetry to analyse it.  
---
They need to have statistics on how much time players spend in each map and their activities.  
---
If for example expansions didn't sell well, but a lot of whales bought the exansions and they spend 200 hours in each expansion map but only like 10 hours in living world maps - indirectly the expansions brought in more money than in direct sales.
---
I would argue the past 7 years is a lot of evidence for it, but I'm not the person you replied to. :P
---
I would say that I can compete in raids with every class as dps/support with either power or condi builds
---
In wvw I never tried anything other than reaper/scourge and firebrand 
---
PvP I play Mirage/Fbd/scourge in gold 3
---
1
---
Seriously.
---
PoF is worth its money. Mounts is the best movement experience in any MMO.
---
Overall top tier gear give you around 15% dps boost. Game designed in a way that you can deal 0.1 of potential dps and be fine. Aside t4 fractals and WvW you do not need top gear. Legendary armor is completely useless/cost ineffective without build templates - the feature we know nothing about aside visuals that consist from existing animations in game and would be releasing sometime in 21st century.
---
In terms of PvE I was a jack of all trades. I was okay on all of them for the most part, but I never excelled at any, except maybe druid but that's not really saying much I guess.
---
For PvP/WvW I was competent with thief (no hate pls) and I was okay on holo.
---
smoke it the propper way!
---
[I won](https://imgur.com/kdmKcKY)
---
not true.
---
True, but this spike is sort of insane even for the yearly inflation rates.
---
As NA player you better of with playing on an international server because your prime time is in the middle of the night here in Europe and most ppl in Germany are sleeping..on international servers you have more luck finding ppl who are still playing on this time (because they have other working hours and coming online when others going of to sleep f.e)
---
It has though,  for example: https://gw2efficiency.com/account/recipes?filter.show=locked&amp;filter.discipline=Chef
---
Never pug. 
---
Ever.
---
It's like playing Russian roulette.
---
32 millions? Hahaha fake
---
Vvvbb:
---
Isn't it true? Everyone at this point noticed that they no longer have interest in fixing and improving the game and are just trying to milk the game until the last drop until it eventually dies
---
Am casual too. Same experience with elementalist haha. It is the first charactet I created and I didn't manage to hit 80 before quitting. Rolled a warrior after coming back a few months later and really enjoyed the simplicity after the ele. Weavers and mesmers have my respect.
---
Can I just get the drum kit as a playable "instrument"?
---
This looks awesome. I have to admit, from some angles, Aurene did look kinda derpy in game prior to her [spoiler] (ascendance into an elder dragon that cannot die, which also looks nothing like any of her previous forms lol)
---
5 and none
---
Didn't you know hardcore players are the most special players. The most important ones and just the best. So obviously, the game will totally die if these glorious players leave the game. /s
---
People who want to feel special make up any nonsense that feeds their narrative.
---
&gt; stellar and astral
---
They're just a bitch to get, that's why you hardly see anyone use them. inb4 someone: "I like them!" Yes, me too! Still though - they're a bitch to get.
---
Every place has its usage and reason. If you had everything on one place, you would invalidate others. That's why yo ucan't scribe outside guildhall as well.
---
Thank you for the good answer!
---
Yeah, kinda like that. Neither one "spoils" the other.
---
What dark age do you speak of ?
---
Actually very interesting and cool suggestions!
---
I personally love all that
---
Charr rock? Sign me up! Reminds me of Level \[enter max level here\] Elite Tauren Chieftain from WoW.
---
Most hardcore guilds publicly stated they were switching to FFXIV or just quitting altogether. A lot of the more serious raiders did the same. You won't get exact numbers, but a lot left after the 25th and the 30th.
---
Probably a joke about how weird or gross looking it is. Not everything is serious business.
---
now... Ele (More than competent at all including base in all game modes) including all builds, staff, s/d, s/f, sc/wh, sc/f, d/d, d/wh. DH, Scourge.
---
Before I'd also say also competent at boon chaos chrono, condi scepter/axe mirage, condi bs, power deadeye (lul), condi soulbeast, heal druid, reaper (no longer know proper stuff but lol).
---
Never REALLY touched engineer nor condi renegade, although I had it geared... interest had already waned too much to be bothered by that point..
---
Want a source? Open the raid LFG. It's a barren wasteland.
---
It is sort of alright on monday prime time, but any other time and it's usually 2 or 3 lfg and a couple of sellers.
---
The PoF amalgamated gemstones revitalized the expansion maps too, it was a good change, if a bit too late considering how obviously good it is
---
Maybe the issue is that you need to play normally and not only farm Akili for gold :P
---
Wow incredible! Can you give me 2000g now please?
---
Also if you have terrible ping, your hero may sync-out slightly making you unable to get a catch (server might get slightly different position of you than what you see).
---
Another example: lagged downed player unable to get stomped in pvp because you can only use action on it's body buy sever thinks it's somewhere else so stomp impact don't work.
---
All *four?* Pardon?
---
I only play Rev, I have all other classes, but Rev is special.
---
Aside from story... you will get some rewards, I think ascended back item Mawdrey is the most notable (at least I think it was delivered through story rewards)?
---
S2 is actually the only season you can play through completely for free - all you need is a friend who owns it and play through it with him. You won't get any rewards, but you can experience the story with him (as it mostly takes place in central Tyria) and the new maps are not locked out for anyone. All episodes for S3 and $ are taking place in the new or expansion maps and you need to own them yourself to do them.
---
They are all positive changes i agreed 
---
But are they considered as an actual content that can motivate ppl to play the game more ? no... (Strike Mission is not included in this point)
---
Those small changes are good and i appreciate them as well but it's not what gw2 players actually need. That's why ppl keep asking for more ACTUAL contents.
---
charr motorbikes, i hope thats a new mount lol
---
still weirdos
---
Because this game is skill based which means that you earn brag rights by being good at the game not by having higher stats.
---
So you wont ever gank anyone because you have higher stats, you gank because you are better. In my opinion how it should be. 
---
And if you are button smashing in PvP then you simply not using your combat skills as it should be and that makes you a avrage player. The good players will squeeze out everything out of anything. That is why they are good and the only way around this is to get better because no gear will change it for you.
---
Mind though i am not saying that you are wrong, if this is what you like with a game and you really want the gear tread mill then i can understand why GW2 do not make it for you.
---
I liked PoEs campaign a lot more than I did D3. D3 feels very fake with the same tropes again and again. It's the big bad guys shit talking to you and moving the goalposts until you find them and kill them. PoE at least has a decent sense of desperation in the first few acts.
---
Things dyed full perma frost are rarely beautiful
---
Anet wont fix this.
---
or maybe they do but need 3 years of brainstorming and approving process
---
but of course another expansion would have fixed everything, right?
---
I prefer the [balrog style](https://i.imgur.com/8DkxZTD.jpg), though I guess they're both equally "original".
---
Lollllll
---
Trying to pug on EU is a total clusterfuck right now ever since w6 came out. So many people quit the game because of slow releases and how disappointing they are. Now w7 comes a long and is even more disappointing than the last one, causing another mass exodus of players. 
---
It's pretty much impossible to find decent pug group to do full clear on Mondays on EU any more.  Before you would get full clear done in 2,5-3 hours.  Now people keep failing basic mechanics constantly, rage quitting left and right causing you to spend a lot of time to find replacements.  So called "1,5k li group" i joined few weeks ago, had a tank that didn't even know how to tank. Weaver at KC doing 5k dps, like how do you even get it that low with that huge dmg buff after pushing.   Commander running in heal necro + druid on their platform at largos, and still dying constantly, unable to meet dps check on their side. 
---
I'm just done with raids, it's a total waste of time most pug groups on EU now take over 6 hours to do a full clear with. And it's only getting worse with each month. Why don't i join a static? I'm burned out on statics, last 6 static guilds i joined, all fell apart after few months of slow raid releases. Two years ago you could do 5 man vg and other lowmans with pugs for fun, can't do that any more since all those people left.
---
Merely new skills seems like it's not going ham enough with the concept of expanding all core professions.
---
Why not, simply put, new core specializations ? Much like elite specs, a core spec would feature:
---
* A new specialization tree you can equip
---
* One heal, one elite and four utility skills of a given category
---
* Access to a new weapon type whenever you equip that specialization line
---
The main difference with elite specs is that it wouldn't change the core profession mechanics, and it could be equipped on any spec slot, not just the elite one.
---
The advantage of such an addition to the game is that it would not only offer new options to the core professions themselves, but to all of the elite specs that already exist, giving them access to new build options.
---
I have to admit though, the reason I thought of this possibility is because of those weapon proficiency icons for specializations that were data mined a while back.
---
sounds difficult. If i got ascended gear, can i change stats and get diviner that way a bit easier? If so, how would that work?
---
I'm not sure I follow you. AFAIK, there has never been an event to announce anything else than an expansion. Them allocating budget for the venue and everything that comes with doing a big event, undoubtedly including some Dev time for the engine cinematics and artist time for the story cinematic, less than a year after the 100+ people layoff, being the largest event they've done timewise, with a countdown and all. Taking their actions at face value made anyone have higher expectations than what they delivered. 
---
Instead they spent the last 10 minutes peddling merchandising like a youtuber that gets his videos demonetized.
---
He bought a bunch of Captain Magnus minis, the pic he posted was because he listed one for 10k gold and the value was taken from that. One was listed at 850g which plummeted his overall value.
---
I mean i get it that when you are totally new to the maps they can feel a bit rough to deal with, but after a while you learn and then they are like any other map and with mounts and glider you can skip nearly anything.
---
Yeah for me the extend of my GW2 the past few months is that a) I finished the actual LS4 story, though just barely, never even explored the map and b) I logged on once to test a new d912xy version for someone.
---
That's... it. There's just 0 motivation to do anything.
---
Though in Shadowbringers they at least poke fun at it, there's a FATE called 'Pray **destroy** the waking sands'. Bunch of sand elementals are running rampant.
---
But alts are baked into your main char as one character can be all classes, so that's less of an issue.
---
Yeah the story is incredibly long, but meh... that's also an upside, but obviously not if you just want to get into raiding.
---
Seems you've followed me quite well. That's what I meant. Last few times we had an announcement like that we had a full-blown presentation showcasing all the mechanics and content and gamemodes and whatnot.
---
This time it was...an announcement. Exactly as they announced. That they'll announce LS5.
---
...and that's what they did. Announce LS5.
---
Literally.
---
And nothing else.
---
Except for that excruciating merch pitch at the end. God have mercy on their soul.
---
This is amazing!!! Well done :)
---
See that propeller over there? thats gonna be a new glider skin
---
&gt;Note: Do not start the culinary food until are at least lvl 440 cooking, since it will not count toward the achievement
---
I'm not going to argue about the experience aspect of this, but making the achievement racial culinary foods before 440 definitely *does* count to the achievement. I'd already crafted the first three Norn dishes before coming here, starting at level 425, and I'm showing 3/35 in the achievement (I also gained 11 levels of cooking in the process).
---
If you're seeing otherwise, then I'd suggest that either (a) it was a bug that's been fixed, or (b) you were crafting them in the wrong location (each of the items tells you to "Cook a ((name of dish)) **while ((name of racial Master Chef)) watches**" - suggesting that you have to do it at the correct cooking station. (I can't swear that the part in bold above is actually significant, but personally I'm not going to take the chance of not doing so.)
---
Guilds come and leave all the time. If your server doesn't have stable community (at least half of them dont) or you're not in one of those guilds, there's not much to do.
---
Same.
---
In lfg.
---
Thanks ! :D
---
I strongly feel the new Thief preparation skills were part of plans for an elite spec. Maybe some kind of "shadowmancer" magic-focused spec.
---
Thanks o/
---
I just don't understand this mentality. Under the same idea, why even have drop tables at all and not have everything possibly drop anything? It's like complaining that you can't farm minerals without mining or direct TP purchase. Maybe someone doesn't enjoy killing champions, doing dungeons or fractals either, why not have random level10 mobs drop exotic gear also?
---
This seems fun
---
For the moment I would say no, I want to focus on my personal art and improve my technics !   
---
But a piece like that would costs around 150-200 euros.  
---

I once found a vigil NPC with a warhorn on his back, that's probably the weirdest case of "NPCs just equip w/e"

Lol didn't ask for a free key I was pointing out to any streamers out there if they're doing any giveaway of it , dont be a dick man
---
The average player gw2 think story content in living world maps is hard content. That statement makes no sense, the raid community used to be much larger and quite a few actually came back for wing 7 but left because its the easiest raid to date. There isnt a point to wait 9 months for a raid only for it to be easier than wing 4
---
haha. its my favorite outfit too.
---
&gt; You don't have to do the metas, you can buy the pieces off the trading post if you want to.
---
Bottom Half is expensive and Top is cheap, so makes sense to do the bottom meta and save time by buying the one from the top.
---

---
He's talking about VitV dude thats more than 400 coins
---
Pve wise I feel like it is fairly easy to be competent on any class.
---
Pvp wise I ahve been plat on Reaper, Scourge, Boonbeast, daredevil.
---
Rewards:  The problem I have with in-game rewards is that everything feels either extremely useless or valuable.  There's not much middle ground.  All these materials with such a high supply and low demand that they run for 2-50c.  Even when you get a stack of them, its nearly nothing.  Then you have items that are so valuable that they are worth more than you can list them on the trading post.  I'd like to see something done about this even further than the unidentified gear change they did.  That was a great start but more needs to be done.  Its more inventory management then caring about what loot I got.  Nothing is really exciting in that regard anymore.
---
Ascended cooking:  It added more power creep for WvW that we've been asking to have lowered, not risen.  The story and leveling up the cooking was done pretty well though and upgrading your home instance cooking station was pretty cool and felt like actual progression.  I'd also wish ascended food lasted longer when put on the ground.  Maybe 10 minutes?  That's probably a relatively easy fix too if they go about doing it.  I am glad though that its not outrageous to craft.  That does help the power creep in some regard.
---
Strike missions: Its hard for me to gauge how well these are going to help GW2 or the players.  Will it really be better than an easy/training mode for raids?  Will it just be more abandoned content in a year if they don't work out well?  I guess time will tell.
---
Build templates:  Gonna be great!  I hope they have them set in a way though that you can only change them when in spawn for WvW.  It could really cause some issues with what roaming is left if you can just break combat and go into a straight up new build to kill a person that was beating you.  Its just another level of disengage that we don't really need.
---
Not everything was bad about last week but there was a lot of disappointment.  I hope we can see improvements moving forward.
---
If you are that broke there are more important issue to solve before wasting time I. Game
---
Whenever I or my guild would move, we would wait until relinks to see if it would be worth it.  Once we started getting paid to move though, that became irrelevant as we were just looking for stacked servers to obtain the most fights.
---
One option is to move to a lower pop server so you can always get paired with fuller servers and be sure you get action across more hours of the day.
---
they must.  i got suspended in the forums for rallying this cause, but its the only thing worth while fighting for.  until then, i solely committed to kill all opposition in the field to get the most kills per week. &gt;.&lt;
---
8000 hours, played since head start.  I'd say thief and mesmer are my worst.  I can play them but can still find myself pushing a wrong button here or there and both of those are less forgiving than something like warrior.
---
I also made legendary armor for my light classes too.  I figured I played them the least so if I ever want to try a new build, I could easily stat swap and save myself a lot of gold.  My mains mostly stay on the same builds for months at a time, a few of them for years at a time (until elite specs come along).
---
No, that hasn't been send out yet
---
Yeah it's really terrible. Wish we had a choice between that and a non vegetal one.
---
Your logic is flawed mate, complaining != hating the game. We complain, I complained a lot, and funnily enough the thing that frustrated me the most was that the announcement did not hype the game enough for new players and the likes. I wanted the announcement to succeed for a better future of the game and not show what I expect to be the future of the game.
---
Teapot says the game is good but he also says, in kinder words than most, the game is shit atm for veteran and dedicated players. His many teatimes on the matter prove that. He is also incredibly frustrated with the game because its wasting its time in story bosses that are beaten once and never again, or seeing the game become so easy that you don't even need to use the amazing combat system it has.
---
That's what I said, weirdos
---
Very nice &lt;3
---
And now guildhalls feel deserted. Going it for the buff and the daily gather. that's it for most people.
---
As a healer/support. You have a basic rotation to give the boons you are supposed to, i.e. alacrity, regeneration, ... And then you add things that your mates need depending of the situation, heal spike, cc, condicleanses, stability and all.
---
which dyes are those?
---
&gt; i feel like skill rotations aren't as important on a healer/supp then dps
---
Most of the time it depends on the class, not the role. Support chrono is harder to play than most dps specs for example.
---
&gt; Do the healer/support builds relly on rotations or should i focus more on a reaction style gameplay?
---
Your primary role as an offensive support is to provide boons and that usually comes with some kind of rotation/priority list. Anything defensive like healing, defensive boons, reflects, stun breaks etc etc should be provided when necessary.
---
&gt; Where could i train my mechanics other than in fractals?
---
Raids, there's plenty of easy bosses to practice on. You can also try higher tier fractals because they have higher pressure. Practicing in low tiers is pointless because you barely even need supports there.
---
&gt; Do you guys have any recommandations on online guides to improve my gameplay ?
---
Snowcrows and discretize offer good builds and tips for them as well as some tips based on encounter.
---

This page as a very helpful forum and can help you with your choice of eGPU/Case+GPU. They answered all my questions Vers precisely back then. I’d suggest you to have a look what setups they suggest for MacBook Pros. Just to mention it, having a MB doesn’t hinder you building a powerful eGPU Setup!

Why is it suprising?

how could they be there, patch isnt out till 17
---
Unid gear and eaters are a waste of shared slots IMHO. 
---
Position rewinder and portal device? How often do you use those? Just get a permanent bank contract instead.
---
it is dead but the market still thriving. I can not buy anything to finish the HoM achievement because everithing is so pricey and there is no way to make money ingame.
---
Instead of the whooshing sound gliders usually make, it makes a bacon sizzling sound. xD
---
I guess someone has bought them and is now trying to sell them.
---
Thx. I defenetly want to go to higher tier fractals but i'm also getting a group of freind. They are just getting into fractals and i want to do the t3 and t4 push with them. I think playing with the same group everyday will also be easier for me.
---
And for raids i'm not into it that much. I didn't want to raid on a dps, this is the reason i started playing healer. (i tried druid but didn't have fun)
---
So fir now i can't train there but it is defenetly one of my long term goals.

Besides, that cooking station is only available to your cook character and you still have to leave the home instance if you need to buy any materials from a master chef.

&gt; I'm not saying this is necessarily the case with Teapot but it is fairly common.

It's business. The end. If OP found some mental peace through this, fine. I don't even think teapot is pretending. But him saying that the game has his great points and focusing on that does not invalidate anything that happened in the last couple of days for me, idk.

...what are you talking about? Do you want us to set our own prices for gemstore items? wut?

This silly and weak excuse needs to stop. "B-but different teams!" Hell if the "Gem Store Team" is really this efficient maybe they should be put on actual content that matters.
---
Cool... I guess...
---
I totally understand your points. The thing is that medium population server now don't have so much stable community. If you know some that has please tell me
---
Well, this pretty much explains why ArenaNet is abandoning the expansion model. Why even commit so much manpower to crunch and ship an expansion only to see a quarter-on-quarter revenue spike of barely 100% for a single quarter when they can make healthy profit off minimal development for the game while diverting manpower to develop potential new revenue streams?
---
This is pretty much the nail in the coffin for the argument that ArenaNet ought to make GW2 expansions because it's good for their bottom-line.
---
While my 7-year long interest in the game is practically ended by the lack of prospects in their Aug 30th announcement, I don't blame them for making this business decision. The numbers don't lie. What a pity for such a great game.
---
Sounds like someone got onto a computer at a mental rehab facility
---
ANy higher populated server that's hovering around t1-t3
---
The spikes themselves aren't the whole story. They keep the quarterly revenues on an acceptable level. I would've stopped playing long ago if it wasn't for expansions.
---
Apparently, no and in this sub, any opinion will be downvoted to hell if it's not majority fluff or simple "I want this, I want that" . Even if it opens discussion possibilities.

I'm kinda glad there was none. With 7 years, you probably would have enough tomes of knowledge to boost many many characters to 80. Now let's get rid of writs and turn them into instant xp after opening the chests like expansions- and season-dailies.

That's amazing, great job

If you think the PoE skill tree is too complex and convoluted to understand, but also think Diablo is somehow more diverse... that kind of explains a lot.

Aurora Glade was for a long time carried by Team Rallybot \[BAD\] - a very strong fighting guild.
---
Conflicts unfortunately developed in the guild causing it to disband.
---
Some of the members, including the leader, transferred to Far Shiverpeaks and started a new guild there (Team Nukem), while the rest transferred to Desolation with their new guild (Salt).
---
Right now it very much looks like Whiteside Ridge is the new bandwagon server.
---
It does not really say much about players who spend gems to constantly transfer to the most popular server.

There is a powerful saying that goes - *" Through great struggle comes great rewards. "*

AG will still have its core players. Find these people, play with them, rebuild. Do not try to fart against thunder.
---
With unbalanced matchups the only thing you can do is to try and find your own way to have fun.
---
This is indeed prob the easiest/cheapest way
---
One dhuum kill on normal mode is still gestuurd though
---
For the gaeting crystals you could just get some Friends and guildies and do river over and over until 150 cap each week
---
There’s your problem. Imagine the hitbox is exactly in the center of the space between the legs. Fit that imaginary center of mass into the circle, not a foot.
---
Right? I was genuinely disappointed. Even if they don't want to give away lvl70 scrolls because they sell lvl80 boosters, they could've given away another round of lvl60 scrolls, maybe 1 lvl60 and 1 lvl10 or something. Now how am I supposed to do lvl80 key runs?
---
Goddamn.

Is there only chests in that room?

I found that here:

Fuck yeah you did! Looks amazing

Crafting stations should be guild hall upgrades. Something for a guild to work towards, that is actually useful and will draw guildies more to the guild hall. Scribe crafting station alone isn't enough.

So 3 per day is maximum i can get? That is not a lot at all :/
---
is this 9gag? or why are we re posting unfunny things that already got posted in the last 24h?
---
Thanks for that nice answer. How many serpentite jewels can i get each day? Currently i think i have to change stats on like 6 items (3 weapons and 3 armor).
---
Trinkets i have to see, how i do that.
---
Sad but true.
---
I mean, it depends.
---
The base gets you access to a lot of content. 
---
The mid level doesn't add a ton but character slots are always a welcome addition, and I love having my Lily of the Elon pass in a shared inventory slot for fast, free travel to the desert, and if you are getting the mid level, going to ultimate is a good idea for the discounted gems. I've heard elsewhere that 4000 gems is exactly the price of all the living world episodes, so you could look at it as adding those...OR you could wait, do HoT and PoF content, and buy LS episodes with the gold you earn playing the game. That's going to unlock living world slower but then the gems can be used for things you can't buy with gold, like more character slots, bank tabs, or unbreakable tools.
---
But you are looking at it.
---
Those are different chests. [The meta-locked ones](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hidden_Chest_\(Thunderhead_Peaks\)) include a guaranteed daily drop of 3 or so jewels. If you **only** need Serpentite go for the meta, if you *also* need a large quantity of Branded Mass or have some extra time after finishing the metas then sure, grab those extra chests as well. Look for farming routes online, there might even be a TacO marker pack for an optimised path provided you have the griffon.
---
Insta Wallpaper, It looks great.
---
&gt; I'll continue down other paths until such time they change their ridiculous policy of not sharing real honest information and their long term plans
---
This is so true.  For the most part I've made all the Gen 1 and Gen 2 Legendary weapons I want; don't really care for the skins on the rest of them and/or the weapon or skin just doesn't fit my characters or build.
---
But here I am, accumulating materials, and I'm wondering if there will be a Gen 3 set of legendaries?  Will they use the same Mystic Curio crafting system as Gen 2?  And why don't I have the answers to my questions?
---
Part of me almost expects ANET to announce the 1st Gen 3 legendary when they launch the saga chapter AFTER the prologue one - but that's what is infuriating.   Why not just announce it so we have something to look forward to?
---
They keep saying they like to surprise us, but in withholding information to accomplish this, they are losing players in the interim, and thereby reducing the amount of players left in the game who will get surprised.
---
Is it though? I'm on EU and nowadays it's pretty much empty compared to what it used to be when raids were more "popular".
---
You can either buy dhuum cm for 350-400mc (europe prices) which gives you a container where you can choose the helmet. This is probably the fastest way to get it reliably.
---
Another option is to buy dhuum for 100-120mc (dhuum can drop the helmet but it's completely rng and fairly rare so don't count on it). This allows you to buy the helmet from glenna for 600 gaeting crystals. You get those crystals from any encounter in wing5-7, so you can just buy dhuum once and do some of the easier bosses (ca, river, statues, sabir, adina) from w5-7. This might take a while as the raid rewards are limited per week so you cannot "farm" river over and over again. The maximum amount of gaeting crystals you can get per week is 150. You get them from killing bosses (once per week) and wiping but the yield is very slow that way.
---
Let's leave a-net alone with this. They need to monetize somehow and special zones aren't atrocious way of doing it. Better they get more $ and start delivering those xpac grade features sooner then later.
---
&gt; You can see in-game how some costumes are made with single textures **that couldn't be separated cleanly into pieces. The edges would not match up well with any other armor pieces.**
---
Dumbass.

I hope they add capes eventually so the Saitama cosplay can be completed..

Not really Obligatory, but would be nice.

Ahem.

Its better to make new legendary instead
---
Unfortunately, awhile back, ArenaNet removed the Consortium Mobile Crafting Station. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Consortium_Mobile_Crafting_Station
---
Would be really nice if they could add them back in as a Guild Consumable. These could be a nice option when folks want a crafting station.
---
If these could be crafted by a Scribe, and available to drop like Guild Banners, Banquets, etc., that could be very handy--and wouldn't unbalance things by having permanent crafting stations where ANet really doesn't want them to be. :)
---
my friends little brother is like that and exactly because of his autism…..fyi.
---
idk.. he's praising Goku.. when clearly Vegeta thinks of Goku as a clown.
---
They could make crafting stations far away from the TP to make VIP pass useful.
---
Because sometimes you need to stand at a crafting station for longer than 5 minutes.
---
My 2nd ranger uses conditions for damage with shortbow and dagger+torch.

it's a meme

in 2 years from now the game will be going towards 10+ years. it's very possible anet will completely switch directions to some other game or franchise.

Finally some quality content on this sub! When the fuck did Goku get blue hair though?

Yeah. It's being infantile, not autistic. 
---
That person has clearly not developed mentally and can't understand how other people have coincidentally have look like them because they can make their own choices and a person's choice won't limit the choices of others.
---
It's not even sharing. You don't say that you own the idea of blue hair, let alone someone's physical hair on their characters. Trying to claim the ownership of it is absurd.
---
I'd be fine with it as long as the elite specs aren't op and plain upgrades of existing specs.
---
So basically balance the game well and gimme elite specs
---
Vip passes = money

Doing anything with guild halls = costs

For every player that would support this, you likely would have equal numbers of players who OWN Eternity that would decry anyone messing with something they already have, especially given it's worth about 4K gold.

Now I'm kinda curious towards your looks 😎
---
Asking the real questions here lol
---
You know cities exist. There is a reason why people buy VIP passes even if there is a crafting station and TP in the same map.
---
That's why I won't buy it because I won't support their stance on that.
---
usual response time is 72 hours. However, depending on how much things they have to deal with and how many information you provided it could take more or less time to get back to you. So, when you think you have submitted all the information that you can think of then all you have to do is wait. If you want to add further information or ask for an update then UPDATE the ticket. DO NOT submit a new one!
---
Right, because fuck everyone except for some large rich guilds.
---
FFXIV has been doing the same thing, giving you all the old expansions when you buy the most recent one. Which is necessary since FFXIV locks progress behind the main story quests.
---
Cities existed before vip passes. They havent added new ones, as far as Im aware
---
As much as I'd love to see masteries used worldwide, I doubt they'll go to HoT and PoF maps and add uses for them like they did with skyscale rifts in core Tyria.
---
They probably made the decision to add hot to pof sometimes before or around dragonfall, and that's why it has so many HoT masteries.
---
so you can avoid all that content you love?

*why dont you do it*

the table... the table is back?

like Teapot said, stop with KPs bullshit already, it is making things worse.
---
I have 150 KP from other wing's bosses, legendary armor, achievos, CMs, multi class, know my rotation and mechanics,  but I am unable to find normal grup for w7 because I skipped first few dais and have only 2kp from first 2 bosses.  
---
Yes I know there are training guilds.. are they? everyone quited,   
---
KPs are the most shitty thing about gw2 raiding change my mind.
---
I've seen some necros afking in the sand swept Isles and killing respawning inquest.
---
You can also join the specimen chamber pre event once in a while to cut down hordes of them. 
---
Inquest drop t6 totems so it's even good money.
---
Yet people buy VIP passes even when cities exist. I wonder why.
---
Lore-wise, that is a valid answer. But from a newcomer's point of view (or from someone that don't care much about the story), the name might be a bit misleading. One would expect GvG or something like that form the title of the game...
---
My maintenance mode started middle of last year just log in do the LW chapter and do a single run of the new fractal/raid wing. It's now degraded to the point of login to make sure to unlock the LW chapter/character birthday packs and I normally do that on the last day possible not the 1st =/.

do you get 60 fps in most areas? not when everything is blowing up. because I get about 30 fps just in a city, this is way to low on maxed.

We also had a firebrand from LN in our grp for quadim w7. Funny enough he was dead pretty much 60% of the fight when we killed it. Gave a few laughs afterwards.
---
Not really though, when you invalidate content because of better gear then you can skip said content much easier because you don't have to do it since you get better gear in the content further down the line.
---
well here goes my list, but this is probably highly opinionated:
---
Strongest 1 weakest 9
---
1. Scourge
---
2.Mirage
---
3. Druid (had to put it here probably not consensus xD)
---
4. Weaver
---
5. Spellbreaker
---
6. Firebrand
---
7. Reaper
---
8. Daredevil
---
9. Herald
---
Once again probably highly opinionated.
---
try a i9-9900KF
---
How come you don’t think engineer is strong atm?
---
Well, I’m easily the best at Warrior. I have three warriors of different build and my main has most of my hours of total playtime. I’ve taken him into fractals and done fairly well, even if I hate being a banner slave.
---
My second best is daredevil, but it’s really hard to fuck up daredevil XD
---
After that... uh, Firebrand I guess? I have a lot of other classes that I play every now and then. My druid is really bad though.
---
-&gt; https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dwarven_Room_Raider
---
Pvp: spellbreaker, reaper, ele
---
Pve: 80% of the meta builds
---
Wvw: omegalol
---
Dr. Freud likes that.
---
It probably is due to the fact that im mainly playing druid and druid feels really strong versus engineers. considering engis 2 elites i would probably even if i had to nominate one go for the scrapper because of their bunkering potential.
---
Basically a non-answer that confirms that an expansion isn’t on the horizon.
---
the** one simple trick** that really helped me is using the search function instead of posting a new thread for the umpteenth time
---
to be honest, super sayan charr are... well, questionable fashion choice. 
---
Not judging you or anything...
---
Who am I kidding, of course I do
---
Actually most companies that are working on expansions for multiplayer games confirm that they are working ond expansions.
---
Its just different people playing... The casuals have caught up to match high LI requirements and experienced players either clear with their static and leave it at that or just stopped raiding all together
---
Yeah i was actually thinking of CoH/CoV, but i hope you are right, id be really sad to love GW2 too :/
---
we'll get free realm change soon tho
---
I think he is talking about those spiky hair styles you get with self style hair kit on charr! Trust me they do look like you went super saiyan. I have blue and gold colour one on one of my charrs and he looks iconic :D
---
Yes enjoyment is subjective, all games are still based on repetition, story isn't a game mechanic.
---
XPAC NOT IN THE WORKS CONFIRMED
---
Mostly we're just upset cause we love this game so much, but it just seems like it's not been heading in the right direction at all. It's like seeing your child fail at school. You love them more than anything but.. where did we go wrong?
---
jumping ship. smart
---
You want them to rework the entire DS meta after all these years? Man... I’d love that and hate it at the same time.
---
Well, that's the thing, that's your personal opinion. I know that I wouldn't have started playing this game 7 years ago if it had that monthly subscription to it, and people in general just respond well to get stuff for free, that's human nature
---
You technically have one with the [golden racing scarf](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Golden_Racing_Scarf), but that's the closest one we're getting.
---
Wait you mean to tell me that chances are there will be another expansion in the future but because of all the layoffs there's no possible way they could be working on one right this second like reddit demands? Who would have thonk.
---
I mean especially if you're targetting people like myself who have a 12h-a-day job and have money to spend but are also hardly playing the LW patches and concentrate on 5-man content everytime I log in to the game, we're not schoolkids or students anyone like back in GW1 days we have money to spend but I don't enjoy spending it on the BLTC anymore, give me some expansions with new features to spend 50$ on, with repeatable 5 man content.
---
&gt; Back when I played Rift, I really enjoyed the group rift/events which spawned out in the world. They were a little like mini-raids, and usually had a few stages.
---
If you explain it to me like that it sounds exactly like meta events. Don't get me wrong I like the idea of strike missions but to me they are more like mini raidbosses than what you just described.
---
Ah yeah I forgot about the exalted one
---
RIP another MMO developer
---
What a sh-itty guy
---
Ill put it to you simply, you can have a 9900k or 3900x, a 2080ti etc etc and in metas, world bosses, wvw blobs you would still drop down to 30 fps unless you drop settings to low. Stable fps isnt an option because of dynamic rendering since it renders players on the spot.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Go for a cpu that can go above 4ghz. The rest is about player models, if you keep them both at lowest you will always have about 60fps, otherwise it will always be unstable. I play with player model settings on low/low so it is somewhay stable but thats the best you can do.
---
The chill parts of this game are populated
---
Wow this is amazing :-)
---
steamed hams
---
except, GW2 isn't even an MMO anymore
---
Are there any other types of baby?
---
&gt; ANet's Fall
---
This has already started, no need for a roadmap.
---
&gt;Like GW2 players are all this poor bunch that cannot pay 30$ every 2 years for an expansion. 
---
You must not have been here when people were crying about HoT not being in the gem store and were trying to argue that anet would still make money if they preordered with gems they converted from gold.
---
RemindMe! September 17th, 2019
---
you could hero/hench pretty much everything tho  o.O
---
Fair enough, but that's my point.  The devs are in a tight spot because while many might agree with the OP (I do, I think Eternity is just waste of a skin) there are others who would insist on it remaining the same.
---
Nah - i mean, we can be disappointed, but let's not be silly. It's still a good game, and if i were new to it i would be happy to start.
---

ooof, well that's bleak. At least we can confirm that they don't have any expansion project being worked on since PoF release, so even if we do get one, it's missing over a year of development time on it.
---
Check the hours man my acc value tanked As of my post. I'm still the top account check the hours played.
---
It even fits a black hole consuming everything.
---
So the only info we got from this is that Arenanet isn't working on an expansion.
---
Yikes.
---
A veteran player told me game has spaghetti code and people who created it left company long time ago. And added implementing new features or changing anything cause a lot of things to break in engine. Could it be that's why it takes so long time for devs to come up with something new or reworks which are working properly?
---
People who made it so good aren't with the company anymore tho - at least most of them. You can have the best combat system in the world but if the content doesnt force u to use it to its full potential then why even bother.
---
Nothing. I never use food unless there is a free meal dropped by someone. It is just not needed for the game.
---
That's like, opinion, man, stop trying to make it sound like it's a fact and that you're speaking for whole community.
---
monkaS
---
And those who aren't say exactly what Arenanet said.
---
Aion and all the other games you mention have different developers, though they belong under the NCsoft umbrella. Anet as a dev company only has Guild Wars franchise.
---
That is **not** how a mentally sound 10 year old acts like. Let's see how many traits from the spectrum does this guy display.
---
* Inappropriate and unusual social interactions
---
* lack of empathy
---
* poor linguistic skills
---
* repetition
---
* preoccupation with specific topics
---
Seems pretty autistic to me. Maybe you should be a bit more open-minded and check your facts before you start acting out in desire to feel morally superior towards others.
---
Mmm good point. I can normally get at least 60. I do a lot of world bosses and fractals, and when things get crazy it starts dropping for sure. There are a few specific settings you need to turn down, but once you do it runs smoothly. I don't remember exactly which ones off hand though. 
---
Also, I an get it to run fine on my laptop, which has a 1060maxq and a 17 7700hq. It's definitely not as nice, but it tends to run between 60 and 40, though I have seen it in the 10s in some crazy bounties.
---
&gt; if the content doesnt force u to use it to its full potential then why even bother
---
That's a fair point - for a veteran. A newcomer, coming here for a fresh experience, will still have hundreds of hours of good entertainment.
---
Most likely, why don't you raise a ticket with support and find out?
---
&gt; Icebrood Saga is the best way we can deliver free content to our players.”
---
He keeps on driving this 'free' comment home, but I think most customers aren't so focused on it being free. Things the customers want are details, quality and quantity. If something being free means we miss out on any of that, most of us are happy to pay.
---
Frankly, I'd rather pay for an expansion, or even a sub, than have to deal with exclusive stuff locked behind RNG lootboxes.
---
[https://www.sunsigns.net/symbolism/aura-color-meanings/](https://www.sunsigns.net/symbolism/aura-color-meanings/)
---
I wish they'd make current racial skills useful. I never understood the pushback people get whenever they dare to suggest that. For example I was hyped as hell to play as a Norn finally because of their transformations.
---
Why does Anet hate fun?
---
Imagine if guild wars 1 is making more money than guild wars 2.  Wouldn't you be surprise?
---
lol guild content in mmo? are you crazy?
---
They overhyped the presentation and only talked about a next story update. Lot of veteran players are angry because they barely talked about any other part of the game like WWW, pvp and raids.
---
I wonder what you think that makes qualify for the "MMO" tag other than being able to play together with a large number of players at the same time.
---
They announced and advertised the game as subscription free. If they change that lawyers will roll out.
---
Personally, I don't care if another expac won't happen as long as they deliver stuff they would with an expac - like elite specs.
---
I usually play with 7-8 characters (4 wvw, 3-4 pve raids), so 5 shared inventory and 2 storage expanders would be my way. 
---
My storage shared storage is at 1500 and it fills so fast, I just can’t imagine having only 500!
---
This is really deceiving though. Having brought friends as new players into the game, I've had to go through a lot of hassle explaining that not only are the expansions separate purchases, but so are the Living World seasons.
---
If ANet really wants to make the game approachable and properly bundled, they need to make the Living World seasons (at the very least) purchasable at checkout. LS2 is there, a *hidden fee* for people who care, and then *more hidden fees* for the Living World episodes between each expansion *after checkout.*
---
Either make seasons from long ago free (LS2 and LS3 at this point), or make sure every season is available for purchase at checkout.
---
Because it's super underhanded to have so many hidden fees just to play the story coherently.
---
Ye it goes up to 5ghz or u can overclock it as intel turbo is not meant to work 24/7. Make sure your power supply is up to the task and you will need really good cooling system and air flow. 9900k is like a nuclear reactor. But ultimately u will get like 5-10 fps at best.  In the end it doesnt even matter you could go with 9900k,9700k,8700k,3700x,3900x,3600 (most popular cpus at this time)  its all the same. This game will behave the same on a 800$ rig and a 1500$rig so dont waste your money.
---
What if I tell you that who wanted to try GW2 already did past these 7 years. The new player argument is getting old at this point. You know what attracts new player? An expansion.
---
You "don't think you have an answer for that one yet"? Your game has been released 7 years ago, when are you going to figure it out? I find that completely crazy to be honest.
---
To be honest I use technobabble on my Asuran in open world content. Just a lot of fun with the extra stun. 
---
Open world isn’t about top dps IMO. But more so just having a blast with the skills you have.
---

---
Finally we got our prime answer. "Its on the table" but the table its long lost. So from now on,we will see LS &gt; LS &gt; LS until they plug out this game. Honestly, i feel that the last 7 years that i invested in this game, time and money, its gone to waste.

You don't **know** shit, the fact that you start off with

 &gt; Let me look into my crystal ball... 
---
You're shooting in the dark, they were vague as fuck in the announcement so relax
---
I'm not a fan of the outfit but this screenshot is hilarious, take my upvote.
---
I do prefer mature babies, ones with some class and decency.
---
That's exactly the reason, there are so many changes that are impossible to make due to UI and backend that they can't touch. They can't for instance change the Party View in PvP to a squad view to support more than 10 players a team, while in the rest of the game it's a simple toggle. I'd assume swiss matching and other stuff is also waiting on UI as well as background implementation.
---
WvW: scrapper for healing, super speed and gyros. Scourge for damage. FB for support. Herald: for support/damage. Roaming: mirage condi. And very sparely I play tempest healer and chrono. 
---
Pve: DH as main DPS, mirage and scourge as condi, chrono as main with multiple specs and roles. Very sparely banner slave, druid. Oh, and dead eye for w7 qadim.
---
They need to actually have a game to have expansions for first, and I'm not sure if that's gonna be the case in 2-3 years time.
---
It made even less sense if it is revenue because if it is profit, you can say the cost of keeping up those other games are too great.  But with revenue,. Lineage is straight up pulling in more money than other games by a ridiculous gap.  The game was released in 98.  I'd imagine they are also spending less on it.  So the profit gap would be even bigger.
---
If I can play 90% of the content solo then the MMO tag is preposterous.
---
The game is horrendously optimised and doesn’t use multiple cores well as far as I understand. Most people have fps drops.
---
Especially forms of profanity which use a trick or device to get around the profanity filter.
---
Well shit.
---
Yes, they were a bit like meta events, that’s true. Except at the end of the encounter there was something like a raid boss, with raid-like mechanics. 
---
I’m personally hoping for more from the strike Missions as well, but that’s a lot about difficulty. Because they are their own class of thing, I hope they don’t get watered down and have their own rewards so that people are incentivized to put groups together.
---
Probably equal to or slightly less performing than 9700k
---
&gt; whole stat setup to delete the screen.
---
this is where you know they don't play the game they ignore movement skills that are in pretty much every build and think heralds are "stat setups". The tree isn't rocket science, if they had at least complained about conversion formula's that would have been more understandable.
---
How dare you stealing *his* horns? xD
---
A lot of it is learned through discord discussions, i see it everyday on mine, people either leaving static runs or dropping by once a month to see how things are atm. We basically have people filling every week cause most seem discouraged to play or simply leave. Most raiders that still play log in for 3-4h, clear raids with static and never play until next week so you will never see them on lfg.
---
norn have them already in the game and some of them got nerfed a lot because they did too much damage.
---
I just like how he keeps going without a single response.
---
It's not about spaghetti code. People use that phrase and don't actually understand coding whatsoever. When a development team changes up it takes a bit to get familiar with past code if they haven't worked with the team before. It also depends on how well documented the code was in the past. Before you introduce new code you have to know what the previous ones do or you might introduce too many bugs. 
---
And that is just coding. Then there's concept art creation, 3d modeling, balancing, story design, etc. There's a shit tonne of work involved and you can hardly expect teams with lots of new members to come out with an expansion just after a restructure. Your average layperson things development is a simple process. It's far from it. I for one prefer them to work on things like WvW restructuring and get it mostly balanced and working instead of rushing something and working out the problems later.
---
What if this was the dialogue in the charr fight in the new trailer we saw lmao.
---
There actually was a time, in the S1 days, when they did say they don't currently plan any expansions.  Clearly they didn't rule them out completely but it was a clearer answer much closer to a "no" than this one. Anet just wants to do something new again, they seem unable to stick to a plan. That said, if we get better living story releases, it might not be entirely bad thing. Especially if (and this is a big if) they manage to give us elite specs somehow without an expanson.
---
Alexa, Play Unravel
---
Sorry, i meant NCSoft not ANet in my post, my bad, kinda confused the two there :/
---
Most didnt even go to classic cause while the game can be fun, the combat is horrible. Atm most gw2 refugees go to FF,warframe,PoE as far as i know. Teapot went to classic cause he used to play it years back so nostalgia hit guess.
---
Well, I'm in the same boat. Played a lot of W5 coz it was an amazing wing and got 60-70 Dhuum KP. Didn't play w7 a lot, killed Qadim twice, got 6 KP and nobody is taking me for w7 :D
---
i didnt even use " super sayan hairs" similiar one

skyscale wasn't even bad...few days worth of time gates, but still was a lot of collection/events involved in it aswell.   People act as-if it would of taken a year or two to get it.   Too many people just have a want-it-now attitude, and run to reddit to cry like spoiled little entitled children when they have to actually play the game/wait a few days for a reward.   The problem with have-it-now, you get it fast then you come to cry that th ere's no content/things to do.  As always, damned if you do / damned if you don't.
---
Pretty sure that was Arcdps build templates for quick swapping between bosses.
---
New players would have to buy one 2k mount skin and Anet almost made their money back they lost with giving HoT for free.
---
It fits easily also other people's hopes and dreams. But its specialty are abandoned features that Anet is afraid to admit that were abandoned.
---
I am the account with 2.9 million my value plummeted. Still number one though. Check my imgur in the other reply
---
&gt;Clearly we won't get them any time soon (otherwise they would have announced it)
---
I think you might be underestimating them. There is a slight, very slight possibility that they have it as a sudden surprise for a release through the Saga (didn't they bring new legendaries or something else really suddenly like that?), being all smug how hype we would be only to do the best impersonation of surprised Pickatchu when they came to work to all the backclash of them not revealing them.
---
I also doubt this is the case, sadly, but wouldn't be actually surprised much if it was.
---
Yeah that's still me. Account value dropped
---
could it have been [this](http://martionlabs.com/arcdps-mechanics-log-plugin/) by any chance?
---
When it comes to storage the best option IMO is to:
---
1. bank \[20gems/slot\] (fast access; up to 17\*30 = 510 slots)
---
2. character \[8gems/slot\] (**slow access**; needs preparation; up to 5\*20=100 per character so 5\*20\*68 = 6800; +100 on your main character)
---
3. inventory slots \[20gems/slot\] (only if you play one single char; makes inventory more complicated; fast access but only 20 slots each up to 5\*20 = 100)
---
4. shared inventory slots \[560-700gems/slot\] (multiple chars; fast access but only 1 slot each up to 24)
---
Giving you a total storage of 510+6900+100+24 = 7534 slots.
---
Not fake account value just fell. I'm still number 1
---
but why not upgrade it now? if it's such a known problem why not work on it all those years? what will it take? for players to drop the game until it is fixed?
---
Chances are, she was hired to work on the living story/saga, so now her time with them has come to an end.   Of course though, people will tie it to .... well you know ;)
---
2 year!! Two ffffing year since pof and you couldn’t make anthonee xpac? Literally mmo are known for xpacs sometbing my god! Out of touch!! Two years mahhhhhhhhhhhhhh lmfaooo.
---
but you're clearly getting better fps than I am, I get over 45 fps while farming, forget the 24-34 in cities. if I get a new cpu (have i5 6400 right now) I will surly get a boost that will allow me to have stable 60 at all times other than in huge wvw areas. read comments here, people have over 120 fps while farming, this clearly means cpu does matter
---
I'd probably consider the liminal moorhound inside the sand theme, jackal is by nature within the sand theme but this skin in specific seems "inline" with the sand griffon and skimmer.
---
Still, good job!
---
so basically the main issue is my cpu, only question is if I should buy that i9 9900k or the basic i7 7700k since gw2 makes use of single core I suppose the i9 is the way to go... I got the money but it just seems over the top, like getting a titan x or something..
---
Hmmm...
---
1. Scourge (active)
---
2. Warrior (active)
---
3. Berserker (active)
---
4. Dragon Hunter
---
5. Holosmith
---
6. Scrapper
---
Seems like it's 3/6/9 (active/feel competent/available).
---
I agree. If you look at the [Path of Fire](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2:_Path_of_Fire#Features) feature list there really isn't anything that can't be done in a living world framework.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/86567/issue-with-the-expansion-boost-event-buff#latest
---
In eu there is still several guilds selling but prices are way higher. In any case, I don't know what you expect 9 people willingly carry you through one of the hardest raids? Sorry but it's not gonna happen for free. 
---
Like you don't want to put in the smallest amount of effort but expect others to put in several hours for your ass? Ä
---
Both sand skins have the name "Sand Souled." Anet started making all themed sets have the same name by the 2nd or 3rd adoption set. This is why I wouldn't consider the Liminal Moorhound to be part of the Sand Souled family.
---
long time and money investment that dont give more money they some mounts skins anyway. Just not worth. Remember like people hated HoT? or like they hated Pof for not having metas? It looks like actually people dont like anet expansions that much. Living world episodes if they fail are quickly covered by another episode - like season 4 episode 3. So living world is safer, cheaper , quicker (but way smaller - but this is not their problem)
---
Oh, you better believe that's a paddlin'.
---
 “I don’t think we have an answer for that one yet. For us, at least today, we know that with the stuff that we want to give – the quality of life improvements, the story we’re trying to tell – Icebrood Saga is the best way we can deliver free content to our players.” 
---
 “I think the important thing here, obviously, is that everyone at the studio knows that there’s a demand for an expansion. So it’s not like we’re ruling it out.” 
---
Are you joking? Just how out of touch can you be?
---
As many others said you as a new player you have a TON of content to play through/ with. The issue is for players that's been around for a long time and basically has everything there isn't much to do. The community in the game is still lively and helpful.   
---
and unless you have an insane amount of time in RL it is going to be a very long while before you hit the wall of "not having anything to do" lol
---
Guild halls are included in the price of expansions.  Their costs are returned via people buying expansions.
---
What you are asking for doesn't exist. It isn't funny for us to tell you that Either. Its just a plain fact we all face.
---
There are so many things on the table, you can't see the table any more.
---
&gt; So you could say it's a mostly Casual MMO
---
Oh, stfu. GW2 was never intended to be casual mmo, stop saying it was. GW2 in its roots is a **hardcore** pvp game, the devs who created GW2 were **hardcore** pvp players. But these devs got poached by amazon and we ended up with the most braindead expansion in any game and now with the most embarassing annoucement of "content" I've ever seen in any mmo.
---
&gt;but saying it isn't an MMO will be a lie for as long as MMO still means what it means.
---
People that you're playing with may as well be bots and you wouldn't even notice. Ranked PvP wouldn't even work if not for bots. So yeah, there's "MMO" for you.
---
Because it would take a complete engine rebuild, the issue is down to the engine itself as it's the same engine used for GW1 and is frankly horribly outdated. You can't just go "WOOP WOOP THIS NEW UPDATE THE ENGINE ISN'T STABBING ITSELF IN THE DICK ANYMORE!!!"
---
They'd have to effectively rebuild the *entire* game, at which point they might as well cease development on GW2 and make GW3.
---
Ok?
---
No, most of us actually don't except for very few cases.
---
I mean ofc at this point they are not ruling out an xpac, they were not planning on having their 2 side projects cancelled all of a sudden and now have to decide when to pick them up again. An xpac would give them more time to work on those projects but it would also mean they will arrive later, much later.
---
Its a discussion now on whether it is worth it or not, bringing in the xpac.
---
probably they were never "ruled in" on the first place...
---
LS3 had some amazing new assets though, I don't really recall people being mad about LS3 maps looking too low-effort. Except /maybe/ Lake Doric, which also had some stuff going for it. 
---
I say let's wait for another 14 days and then judge the map.
---
They were also against mounts for a long time.  It ended up being one of their best features in the entire game.
---
once you get both halves of the light of deldrimor plate, you take it to the tombs and get the Light of Deldrimor utility effect and the key to the first tomb room, you go through the maze there and then at the end you get the next tomb room key.  There are 3 rooms total and then the vault room which has the big chest of guaranteed jewels.
---
Additionally each tomb room has 2 hidden chests that you use the Light of Deldrimor to find, the light will point you in the general direction of the nearest chest and then will reveal the chest when you are close enough.  each chest has a chance of having a jewel.
---
Additionally there are 2-3 hidden chests in the upper tunnel maze where the ghost dwarf tries to get you to turn around and return to the tombs to hang out with him.
---
that about covers it but any other info you can easily find on the wiki.
---
The entire game, sans expansions and living story, is free to play.  What's your point?
---
&gt;Be wary of the hugbox lad, I'm rather new myself and feel burnout 6 months in. The loads of content that people are talking about has to do with open world farming and achievements.
---
Uh.. what exactly have you been doing to be burned out in only 6 months.  Of course farming/achievements are part of the game.  Could take 6+ months alone to just properly go through the full story line (including the expansions/living story episodes) depending on the amount of time you dedicate per day to the game.   Then there's learning things like PvP/WvW , Raids, Fractals, leveling your crafting professions, getting all of the mounts (don't forget griffon, skyscale and beetle).
---
TL;DR -&gt; 6 months is not even enough time to get into being burned out/repetitive phase unless you play the game like 8+ hours a day...
---
I actually wasnt here, i started GW2 a few months after HoT released. Must have been hilarious.
---
I guess it's safe to say that if they aren't ruling it out then it isn't planned either..
---
However the code was designed poorly and is probably shitty in a lot of places. The base game was rushed in some areas and nothing is worse in the software industry than rushed code. Then you build stuff on top of that code cause you gotta push content, no time for rewrites, and all goes to fuck from there.
---
Honestly, a big part of that dreaminess probably came from a different pace of gameplay altogether. I've felt much more of it aimlessly walking (not running) through some corners of GW2 Ascalon, and much less riding through the zones on mounts on the lookout for the next POI.
---
"IN NEAR FUTURE" "ITS COMMING" "ITS ON THE TABLE" "WE ARE FOCUSING" "OUR TOP PRIORITY"
---
Most of people who defend the LS model use the argument that it's free content tho.
---
Although I agree to a certain degree, I also think they have settled for mediocrity. It's like going to a McDonalds because you saw how good the hamburgers look in the ads, but you know they will give you something completely tasteless and mediocre, yet you shrug and eat it anyways, saying "at least it's food".
---
This is your answer. The CPU with best single core performance will get you the best performance in GW2. It's not going to change much, but this game is not optimized.
---
But if you want the best performance possible, you need the best CPU possible. No, it's not going to be worth it. Yes, it's going to be a waste of money, but this is really the only answer that's going to net you better performance. It's not going to be a massive improvement over what you have. The game just runs like shit.
---
That hint with the 1000:1 conversion ratio on some items was a good tip. Thanks for that. Sounds like another reason to aim for 1000 storage space
---
inb4 merging Exordium + Eternity to form ~~Captain Planet~~ Eternium
---
We know that some of the code has barely any documentation and people that created it has left the company. Dungeons, WvW blueprints etc is all almost untouchable because of this.
---
Is it fast with a thief or should I stick with the ele?
---
Allow me to make a short comment on the announcement.
---
When the spokesperson reach the part when he said: Now **where’s Guild Wars 2 headed?**
---
People are **not meant it literally** where we heading on the game map.
---
We meant what are the **plans for the game's future**.
---
gliding for central tyria was released like year after HOT,when milion ppl ask for it. ANET told us that its not possible,technology wasnt there,engine limitations and shit and that BOOM here you gliding boys.
---
No. It was the most common language spoken in the world until about 23 hours ago, when everyone who spoke Spanish was suddenly inflicted with an incurable and fatal disease. So sad. F
---
&gt;PoF maps fall into the same category, very unrewarding. People don't bother with them till this day.
---
I definitely see way more people playing them now that they added rewards that mimic HoT chests but can't tell which ones are being played more on average.
---
Point is guild halls already been paid for. New feature of crafting station creates new costs without increasing revenue. I hope you are not going woth argument "more people will buy expansion if guild halls had crafting stations"
---
Yeah, someone else who looks like that is who I'd expect to rage about stealing their character.
---
I do with ele now because mounts make thief shadowsteps redundant and you get piercing on dagger fire auto
---
If this remark is truly enough for you, godspeed. Keep enjoying what you enjoy
---
For me and a handful of people I know this wasn’t of any substance and did express further uncertainty. Fair enough I didn’t expect any remark at all so, yeah it is something. I’ll let them figure it out if it keeps players sticking or not.
---
If you gather a lot of materials then Storage Expander increases every material slot which is less time dropping off stuff in the bank if you overfill with materials from gathering/salvaging.
---
Shared inventory is good for items used on many characters like if you only have 1 set of perma-gathering-tools, copper/silver/rune-o-matics, Portal Scrolls/Tomes, etc. You can swap them without having to swap instances (or like you don't have a perma bank contract).
---
I mean, you could. But Henchman are brain dead and Heroes didn't come out until Nightfall. I'd still value a full team of people than heroes.
---
Quite the opposite. This means that they are not working on an expansion currently. Since an expansion takes a long time to be made, it seems like we are stuck with Living World for at least the next two years.
---
Speak for yourself, a lot of us got started playing GW because a subscription fee is out of our budget. I for one *very* much appreciate how much of the game is available for free.
---
The world's bigger than just you and your preferences.
---
Yes, somebody does.
---
All you've told me is that you are not part of that sizable chunk.
---
noup
---
Do you recognize name Joshua Davis? Because I have a feeling you don't.
---
Meanwhile there is number f2p games where you only buy cosmetics and QoL like shared slots and bank space.
---
GW2 model indeed failure for new player experience on the market. It is only successful due to players that come from sub-era when GW1 was really great offer for value.
---
No MMO I’ve ever played is an MMO by your definition..and I’ve played most of them.
---
it doesn’t run perfect but it runs pretty darn good, almost perfect on my 5960x at 4ghz, 4ghz cache, and 1080ti(probably doesn’t help) i don’t even think that’s an expensive cpu/ram/board combo anymore
---
I always ele with multiple weps so its really fast but then again I also tome to 45 for my full exotic zerk gear and the level 40 key
---
I realize this PR grab is lip service and all, but some of you guys are just so *angry*. You rage when they are silent, you rage when they make a public address. I think some of you will only be happy when you get an announcement for a specificvfeature that you individually want complete with due dates.
---
The whole thing was a mess from start to finish that threw all regional plot threads out the window.
---
In the end we were given excuses of time and other constraints not letting them include "everything" despite how long they had to work on it, All while they've proudly stated how often they completely scrap stuff and start from scratch. Anet's problem of not planning things in advance and sticking to it can be even worse if they know there is more time in which to do it.
---
Classic WoW
---
By the time the layoffs happened the fractal update was already behind in the proposed schedule. 
---
So unless they weren't working on it theres no reason not to at least update us on when we can expect the next one.
---
My personal opinion, which likely differs from many others, is as follows: most recipes don't require more than 1-2 stacks of material, so having more than 500 storage capacity isn't necessary.  For those items that do require more than 500 of any given item (like 600 Winterberries for a rebreather) you can stash those 100 extra on a mule or bank slot.
---
I considered buying the storage expander when it was on sale, but for now, for me anyways, I maintain that 500 storage is sufficient, and any materials I gather in excess are sold off on the TP or converted to other materials:
---
eg. When I pass 500 of a T5 trophy I make a Curio.  When I have more than 500 Iron ingots, I make a Del ingot, etc.
---
I'm not one for TP flipping though, so that aspect has no appeal to me.
---
All that said, Shared Inventory slots for me have wavering appeal for me. I currently have 8 of them, and while I could always buy more, I'm not sure why I would need more of them.  Mine currently contain: Inf Mist Omnipotion, Copper Fed, Prototype Rewinder, Season 3 Portal Tome, Spearkmarshals Plea (which I will one day replace with S4 tome..or maybe not), Mistlock Sanct Pass, Perm Portable Provisioner, Teleport to Friend.
---
The Gleam of Sentient, Ley Line, etc, are all in a single character's bags, I just swap over to them to use the cooldowns as part of my routine.  Each of my characters has a Mystic Salvage kit in their inventory, and even with only 20 slot bags, I find it hard to worry about 1 slot being used on each character. (honestly, most of my characters cart around a ton of garbage for no reason)
---
So later this week I'm more likely to buy 2 Bank Tabs vs 1 Bank Tab + 1 Shared Inv.
---
I mean, I hope this isn't news to anyone who's been following the game's development. All they've ever said is that they're going straight from S4 to S5, rather than the next expansion as was expected; there haven't been any statements about what their plans are beyond that. I personally wouldn't be surprised if there was an expansion after S5, but that's just as much speculation as any other possibility and probably at least a year and a half out at this point regardless of what they do.
---
I'm bad with names, I've never heard of any Grouch.
---
I'm not "ruling out" conquering single-handily conquering China and declaring myself grand supreme emperor Jason the XVIII either. I appreciate them acknowledging the disappointment, but that is just about as vague as they could get. Not even something more feasible like "new elite specs are coming during the Icebrood Saga".
---
thanks guys :')
---
Ah, got it. Thank you so much for the info! I saw a condi chrono build on Snowcrows but hadn't really looked at it since I also play mirage. Thank you for the detailed reply!
---
Thank you for clarifying. Actually your reply matches with what he also told me that time, I'm going to [share](https://imgur.com/a/yAS58uK) it (he doesn't mind) to prevent confusion since I can't seem to express it on my own. For me, if this is the real reason behind not having most wished changes by players or updates/contents getting late, they could tell us and then take time to rework engine but then they will lose money by not releasing/focusing enough on money making stuff and this is surely an unwanted situation for the both companies. So I feel like they and us stuck with this.
---
Technically central tyria gliding was released in the next year but it was only a few months after HoT
---
I wanted to come back and buy my characters a new outfit (costume, wings, weapon skin). But then I watched the announcement, and considering we will not get a new expansion in the foreseeable future (i guess they won't have another live show for, at least, the next 6 months), I'm getting the feeling we're getting close to a Wildstar moment (closing the servers down). I'm really on the fence :(
---
Sorry, I don't see many people having faith in Arenanet here, to the point where the phrase 'not ruling out' translates to 'we are working on it'.
---
Yeah, feel real bad for teapot regarding having to send out those prizes... not a fast process.
---
Same quote.
---
A thousand times this. More homogenic builds and even less diversity between classes is the last thing we need in gw2, so I'm all against EotN style PvE skills coming with the Saga.
---
People sometimes joke about this, but I feel like they could make GW1 work. I'd replay it on mobile if they got a decent way to do it. That or like.. polymock.
---
Reminds me of WvW... it exists, we would talk about that some day.
---
Mesa is table for spanish.
---
Not the exact quote but [related](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/881vs8/spaghetti_code_strikes_again_cof_path_2/dwi1zvu/)
---
That is the pun, yes.
---
Dude WTF that color belongs to Superman why are you using so much of it?
---
90% of the content in any mmo is completable solo.
---
Que?
---
This hit me by surprise, haha. I'm guessing when I get used to combat in HoT I'll obliterate mobs in core.
---
“Extrasensorical”.  “Worthless like ginger”.  Wut
---
My favorites are Berserker, Herald, Holosmith, and Soulbeast. I usually stick to those and never really swap their elite specs, but I do have them unlocked.
---
I’m a PvX player, so I do a lot of Open World, Fractals, and PvP. Not too big into WvW, sadly. I play Berserker a lot in ranked (despite it being horrible) with a super glassy build. Herald and Holo are my tryhard characters, and I actually run full melee Soulbeast a lot of the time.
---
Sorry to say but this will be a terrible design. This basically means GW2 pay 2 win.
---
Cause an elite spec is not a skin, it can give you a real and big advantage.
---
no it isnt, is the original (you can see it listed in revenue before the mobile one realese), the mobile one is called lineage m and is on mobile revenue
---
Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I'm just saying if its on there and they for some reason don't have a clear up, I'm balancing the situation for them and watching everything that is regarding my role in the group.  Obviously 10 stacks of bleed isn't really a problem in any situation, I was just trying to give a hypothetical.
---
i'd call living world episode content incredibly subpar compared to the path of fire or heart of thorns expansion.
---
Because the elite specs weren't designed to be equal in spvp since sPvP is balanced according and in service to conquest. By this, I mean you should really try to understand what it means for a class to be meta in spvp if they have to be forced into Conquest. This is also my concern of inventing a new gamemode for sPvP like 3v3 which would work a little better than 2v2 but not that much better. Similarly, the elite specs probably weren't designed with sPvP in mind anyways or else, we'd never have seen deadeye. 
---
For example, the only way DH is ever going to be meta again is if they're back to one-shotting and that meta was unarguably worse than what it currently is. Similarly, the only way tempest will ever be a meta support class is if their heal and condi cleanse is so powerful and instantaneous, it makes all of Firebrands strengths, Firebrand's healing + boon overload + utility, look pathetic in comparison. Same idea, this would be so much worse than the FB support meta. Chronomancer's peak singlehandedly killed Gw2 Esports (well, its an oversimplification since it was already dying) but the only way Chronomancer can ever be good again is if its stronger than Mirage's ability to side-node in light of other current contemporary sidenoders. Mirage, as you may know, is already ridiculously powerful to the point that they had to disable a whole trait line to attempt to equalize it. Essentially, the inherent design of Mirage makes Chronomancer, besides some meme utility build, obsolete. And so on and so forth with other builds that are out of the meta.
---
PoF's elite specs are stronger by design and you can very much see that PoF specs were designed to succeed or defeat HoT specs (in most cases, there are obviously still some meta HoT specs). I don't want to get into it case by case but if you played a little more and understood it, you'll see it for yourself. Take a look at the way FB + Scourge compliment one another and think of the way the interact with other specs and in the grand scheme of conquest or the way and philosophy around the design of Holosmith, Mirage, and Weaver and, to a lesser degree, Spellbreaker. Take a look at the few HoT Specs that are viable in play like Reaper, Condi DD, and Power Herald (which is probably still meta) and understand why they're still viable. If you can find it, look at past metas and understand the criticisms of them. 
---
SPvP and Conquest doesn't allow all classes to flourish and its really silly to say "all elite specs should be viable" and why skill splitting can only do so much. The fact that each class has at least one spec that is meta is a consolation already and its basically the "lesser of two evils". And projecting your inability to understand a gamemode that you don't play often as if it's some sort of selfish way for me to maintain a ranking in a dying, if not dead, gamemode is really silly.
---
&gt;Playing Dragonfall a bit more...
---
Jahai Bluffs also has an armor set like that, arguably even better than Dragonfall’s.
---
&gt; Well, I do like having rewards that are themed to specific content. Having a branded drop a branded item, for example 
---
And raid armor comes from raids. I don't think this is very complicated. Considering they appear to have a difficult time making anything else than story content, I wouldn't expect them to do thematic raid armors, so we have to settle with just one. 
---
 
---
&gt;They do.
---
Well then that's just dumb. Do dungeon exotics also drop from Yaks? Ascended gear from random villager risen?
---
My point is, having distinct gear sources that make some gear rarer than other is what attracts most players to loot games in the first place.
---
&gt;Most of the time it depends on the class, not the role. Support chrono is harder to play than most dps specs for example.
---
Meassured with which parameter? Because having 100% Boon uptime is pretty easy. Having 100% benchmark dps is not. Mechanically DPS is the hardest role.
---
Them being a bitch to get makes me like them more. It means you see very few people around wielding them. I use the Stellar staff on my weaver and I frequently get people saying "wow dude, what staff is that?" and "can you ping your staff plz?"
---
I wouldn't get that if I was wielding bifrost.
---
PoF and HoT elite specs are behind expansion and PvP/WvWers cannot use them until they buy expansion. Isn't that a P2W as well?
---
right now they aren't working on one though and that is the only thing I said.
---
Even if they start working on one today we are looking at a long wait.
---
Oui
---
A rebranding of the LS name.
---
Hey, I have a Guild Wars 2: Toy Mini Eye (pet) code. Do you want it? (free, obviously)
---
The vets expect expansion OR expansion level content from LS, because ANet THEMSELVES said that they are going to bring expansion level content with LS; so, it's not a blind expectation that players randomly came up with.
---
Dunno, it seems disingenuous to me to pretend there was no indication that this would be a bigger event than the equivalent of a spoken blog post. IMO, calling the event an ANNOUNCEMENT event was their mistake, along hyping it like something really big and exciting when the actual LS5 was neither the most exciting part compared to strike missions, nor the most important part for the state of the game, considering the HoT + PoF bundling for new players.
---
but ginger is good for the health... O_o
---
You can tell on the fire breathing. That’s how you know
---
If Anet sold WvW part of GW2 to another company to develop I would buy it.
---
Played half of those...and solo 90% of the time.
---
I Hench'd the entire Prophecies/Factions story pretty easily. Those buggers weren't that bad, in fact I'd say the healers were better than most players!
---
The AI helpers were good enough that GW1 only required grouping for end-game content.
---
probably the same guy that bought out the concentration sigils so he can remove the onesthat are slotted in them. They still cost 15g to craft yourself.
---
I don't like that too honestly, i got the point, but at least is included in a pack of features which is the expansion that also bring in a lot more things.
---
I don't know, i can answer with another question :) Do you think that buying an elite spec with real money is somewhat different then buying let's say a stronger weapon in an FPS obtainable only with real money?
---
What an expansion also brings: media presence.
---
changes these doesn't help, I need to change to much to get those good fps in a town
---
They are actually releasing features with this LW expansion, don't forget. A lot of people are downplaying the announced features like Strike Missions because it isn't exactly what they asked for. I want to give it a chance though. If Strike Missions end up being enjoyable content I will have faith in Anet moving forward with adding gameplay features to LW. At that point, I will have to say we need to address the issue with accessibility to LW post-release if everyone starts doing gameplay exclusive to LW.
---
That being said, I think the story needs a bit of the season 1 feel restored. After killing Zaitan in the core Personal Story, we are suddenly handed a series of events where various non-dragon threats are on the move. This all culminates into a seriously blind siding attack on LA and a follow up battle to take down the mastermind behind it all. Yes, at the end it ended up being part of the machinations of a dragon, but that original feel of "other threats" was incredibly invigorating. The start of Season 3 and 4 were similar with the White Mantle finally making a move and Joko doing Joko things, but in the end they bounced back to elder dragons. I think what we need is a Season 1 style shake up of a side threat that permanently changes an old map and adds or removes a non-dragon threat to the game.
---
HL3 confirmed!
---
well people here left comments saying they had stable 60 fps on max with many different i7
---
they only had problems with wvw combat and huge raid bosses, this is basically what I want. right now even farming I get like 45 fps, even with no players around, this is bad..
---
At this point I start to disbelief that this actually true and Anet just never wanted to develop this game aside gemstore after 2012 release. Someone branded their "not enough will to hire game systems coders" as "spaghetti code lmao do not touch. enjoy half assed fractals" and it is going on. But once mounts skins become on the to do list, they suddenly learned how to deal with "spagetti code"
---
so how is this game going to survive? or are they just waiting for tech to reach the state where everyone have the cpu needed to run the game perfectly?
---
&gt; Now it’s “PoE is free and has like 10x the content and build diversity as Diablo? Sign me up!”
---
thats a vast overstatement. you could say that poe adds 10x content each patch compared to diablo, but the end result is that they push the power creep ceiling higher, higher and higher each time, nullifying previous content. the one silver lining of d3 not getting updates anymore is that the game isnt becoming more and more of a disfigured caricature like poe looks nowadays.
---
Anet is hard blue balling their players.
---
Youre either lying or u didnt get really far then
---
well people here said in the comments that with a few i7 versions they were able to get maxed out perfect 60 fps and even 120 fps, only drops were seen in huge raid or wvw battles.
---
*These changes are not live yet.*
---
&gt; Is there a reason why you would exclude it from the whitelist? 
---
I am going to remove the whitelist altogether. This is not really in response to this #1 account value, but more because the 30m (that got corrected down very fast) trigged me to look at it again and check my assumptions. In doing that I found it weird that some items get excluded from the rules for no good reason, except that they had, e.g. "Mini" in the name.
---
Here's the new definition of a "normal item", which is going to use the sell price. If *any* of these match, it will use the sell price, if *none* of these match it will use the buy price:
---
- **The buy price of the item is higher than 500 gold.** This is to catch generally valuable items that people might not have buy orders for temporarily because they are so expensive. Generally, you cant manipulate this either because if you do a buy order of e.g. 600g for an item that is only worth 3g, someone will fill your offer and it will correct itself down.
---
- **The supply of the item is higher than 5000.** This is the "catch-all" for high throughput materials, where the market generally self-corrects very fast. You could theoretically manipulate this by listing 5000 items at a high price, but this will cost you a ton of money you can't get back, and someone can just list an item for cheaper and it's all for nothing.
---
- **The sell price is less than the buy price / 5.** I think it's fair to say that if someone is willing to order an item for 100g and there are some listed for 400g, the value *could be / is closer to* 400g. Meanwhile, if there are orders for 1g and there is an item listed for 10000g, the value is closer to 1g.
---
- **The sell price minus the buy price is less than 2 gold.** This is to handle all the little items where the other metrics might not grip correctly (e.g. a 20c profit could be 800% ROI). This is generally also hard to manipulate because to make a real shift in value you will have to have a ton of the items on your account (1/2 item per gold increase).
---
&gt; Supply wise this item could legitimately have that value as there are barely any left. I have been buying it over 3 years and have continuously seen the supply move slower.
---
So, in case of your item, it could legitimately have that value (I agree with that - discontinued items tend to have immense value), and as soon as someone will show interest by putting up a buy order for at least 1/5 of the current sell order or &gt; 500g it will snap back to the sell price.
---
Hopefully, that answers the question. I'm also always up for discussing the definition(s), so if you want to do that feel free to PM me or message me on Discord ( https://discord.gg/9yPNPZ9 ).
---
More like tossing things onto the table and hoping it doesn't roll off of it.
---
I'm more annoyed that they are more transparent with press than they are with us.
---
"We're gonna hold off on heavier expansion content to have a phase of quality of life" - COOL SOUNDS GOOD, TELLING US WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS GOOD. I don't wanna wait for pcgamer or some electronics news site telling me what you could have said.

&gt;*The Icebrood Saga*’s prologue episode, “Bound by Blood,” arrives on September 17. Are you ready to learn more? Just for fun, we’ve created a digital magazine full of info, images, and surprises! Take a tour through the map-wide meta event celebration in Grothmar Valley, get a sneak peek at Taimi’s treatise on the Elder Dragons, and meet some of the major players you’ll encounter as the story begins. Check it out [here](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/september-04-2019).

---
&gt;the game engine is badly written in some aspects.
---
That's just saying that how the game engine was written at the time may not longer be adequate for what they want to do now. 
---
Even if they had redone a new engine specifically for GW2 there would have been moments where they wouldn't be able to easily make certain things happen if they are out of scope of the initial engine work.
---
Okay, I agree with what you're saying, but I don't feel like you're addressing anything I put forth.
---
Yes, features are being added with the upcoming saga, but again, are we supposed to ignore all the gaps created by previous Living World seasons just because it doesn't offer important features? Features aren't the driving force of this game, story is.
---
If you don't want to address this, then fine. I've said enough. But this problem is seriously underhanded and may leave new players with a bad taste in their mouths right off the bat, and that's a terrible business model whether you support ANet's decisions or not.
---
&gt; nothing is ever ruled out with Anet
---
To be fair ANet pretty clearly told us dungeons are done kappa
---
Certainly not a physical release.
---
I think it is just meant to look like GW1 print ads (hence the font).
---
ArenaNet has gone full woke. Taimi is referring to Jormag as "they" with the following footnote:
---
&gt;The non-binary possessive pronoun here reminds me: since our relationship with Aurene has evolved our understanding of elder dragons vis-a-vis gender identity, you may want to add a new section on that topic, she may even be able to tell us what Zhaitan and Mordermoth identified as, if they did.
---
Now ArenaNet should go full broke as well.

I want this box on my shelf &gt;:(
---
Yeah her ascended form is much more elegant looking I guess. Like a cross between the shimmerwing and Glint.
---
But I really wanted to see big Aurene, one that enhanced her previous forms :/
---
Probably world of wow because there are always expansions
---
Even as pdf some parts are painful to read, like gorrik/taimi one
---
&gt; After you've fisnihed the prologue story, you'll be able to tackle a harder version of its climactic encounter with up to nine other players
---
Strikes starting with the prologue?
---
Someone is farming for downvotes it seems
---
Its not a box version of the saga. I think its a way of advertising buying PoF and HoT to play the saga also they are clearly doing a spin on the GW EOTN box.
---
Merchandising Saga continues 
---
5 merch ads
---
Viewing it is not that bad. You can click on the magnifying glass to see a closeup of different parts. Overall, I like the magazine.
---
go for GWAMM on alts, UW, DoA, FoW
---
No Icebrood Saga is free for all players but you need to buy PoF to play the content after the prologue.
---
You should try this in eb. Go to the hylek camp then to the sunken pirate ship. Climp up the long chain and then glide thowards the hylek camp from the top. With few leaps and gliding you lad up in kolvan. I would assume you can get inside green base with the same trick you used in the vid. Hope you got it.
---
AKA pulling a Joey Salads
---
yeah i got that but the whole magazine is made up to look like that, not only the ad.
---
Yeah I figured as much. Still interesting to see "disc 1 of 4", may be a way to "spoil" how many episodes a Saga is made of. Could be a way to develop a plot without having to cover 6 full episodes but less.   
---
In order to maybe avoid a "One path ends" situation again where an episode is clearly filler...
---
looking at how they spell sh-its they probably dont
---
There is a strike coming in this episode as well. "After you've finished the prolouge story, you'll be able to tackle a harder version of its climactic encounter with up to nine other players." -page 11 for some reason can't zoom in on that text and the one about the mini-dungeon/jumping puzzle.
---
My political consciousness is beyond reddit, fortunately
---
Well they did say stuff weren't announced they even mention that in the magazine so we don't know I think its more than likely strike missions but if the suddenly drop a bomb hard mode story instances hardcore players will be happy.
---
why would it?
---
well! practice makes perfect!
---
&gt; LS3 had some amazing new assets though, I don't really recall people being mad about LS3 maps looking too low-effort
---
I think there are a few reasons for that:
---
1. It took anet forever to release new content so people were so desperate for new stuff that it didn't really matter.
---
2. This time they announced expansion level stuff/quality for ls so showing only really old assets copy and pasted onto a new map with sprinkles of new assets seems a bit like a bummer to me. Despite that using older assets isn't that bad if done right but as I said this time it looks cheap imo.
---
I'm excited to see what they're going to deliver with the first "episode" but so far it doesn't look too promising from a visual standpoint.
---
What is so out of touch here? They do aknowledge that there is a demand for and expansion (well, at least. that is what people say, financial analysts may thing otherwise). And they clearly don't have anything expansion-sized to release in the near future, assuming they didn't have gw2-releated stuff at the point of layoffs, they are probably making iBS as fast as they can already (and the prologue is going to show that, it will be rushed as fuck).
---
To be "in touch" they need to say what, "we are dropping all our plans and starting to make expansion, see you in 1,5 years of zero content releases"? If LS is equal to game slowly dying, then this would be a  shotgun shot to the head.
---
Where is it then, up your ass?
---
♪♫♪ People cannot seem to find
---
4 more people
---
4 more people ♪♫♪
---
Oooooooo
---
&gt; but at least is included in a pack of features which is the expansion that also bring in a lot more things
---
Too bad these features are around PvE and not PvP/WvW. 
---
&gt; Do you think that buying an elite spec with real money is somewhat different then buying let's say a stronger weapon in an FPS obtainable only with real money?
---
It is not different for me since we already got this one. Even if we exclude Elite specs, stats are there. You cannot use HoT/PoF stats such as Viper or Griever if you don't have specific expansion.
---
&gt; If with real money you mean gems then i have nothing wrong with it for example, cause this mean that any player can obtain it, maybe in an harder way, but is at least possible.
---
By real money I mean real money. Not gold to gem conversion. Just like expansion which can only be bought with real money.
---
What I proposed is basically same what we already have with one exception. They are not tied to expansion. There was not much for PvP/WvW only players which could benefit from expansions other than elites and new stats. 
---
I still believe they should be paid but their price should be way lower than expansion prices. Just few (max 5) dollars to unlock all 9 elites should be plenty IMO. This would be a small but still noticeable boost for Anet and 5 dollars is not that high amount of money to gather in one/two months.
---
Oh.. that would be very interesting.
---
~50% of the studio is LGBT tho, they're in full political mode.
---
Over a third of the pages are just advertisements...
---
You: Makes a Charr
---
Random arsehat: YOU COPYING MY CHARACTER! I PWN YOU 1v1 noob... 360 no scope.. teabag
---
Will they, though? You can only progress HoT masteries with HoT experience and HoT mastery points. Imagine a player trying to progress through a Season 5 map, and they come across a ley line gliding opportunity... and in order to progress, they have to go grind HoT maps for a week to get the experience and mastery points required. That'd be a terrible and unintuitive experience.
---
Well it's 2019.. Guess male characters can't fight this dragon now or it'll be seen as male dominating with power over females. /s lulz
---
So whats the cavern of khan ur? A dungeon? An instance? An mission strike?
---
yes, I think they didnt release a hard copy for PoF and this might be the way they introduce it. It bundles PoF and HoT together and the new Icebrood Saga name/design will suggest that this is an "expansion-like" release to new players with free content updates in the future (the episodes).
---
And that is my point, it isn't a default company line. It is a default company line of companies who are unequivocally not working on expansions at that point in time.
---
sounds just like 10 man migraine. let's wait and see if there is more to this than just a one time achievement.
---
Not "story instances", the prologue that comes out in a few weeks.
---
We can assume this is what the strikes are.
---
No expansions used to have multiple discs so its likely 2 HoT disks and 2 PoF disks. I expect more than 6 because saga updates could be anything
---
&gt;  Prismatic Elder Dragon
---
Uh, oh.
---
One dragon to contain them all.
---
The issue is there isn't really an alternative. People like GW2 because it does a lot of things very well that other games don't; combat/skill system, keeping old content relevent, skill based PvP, Realm Vs Realm gamemode with lots of potential, really fun and we'll designed instances. Unfortunately, Anet neglect these parts of the game, but because there are no good alternatives for many, they stay and get frustrated.
---
This is... kinda cool, but I can't help but feel like it's not a very good way to present it? Why isn't the info just on a webpage? It's really hard to read
---
Looks a bit stupid to use the classic font for that, but use the current one on the box.
---
Imagine players coming across random shiny orbs floating around only to be told they need to farm up 250 s4 materials to obtain the mastery to do something to them hmm
---
Looks old and tired even with the use of gw1
---
jfc you guys are sad, literally anything that's not straight and it's "HUR DUR WOKE POLITICAL SJW NONSENSE"
---
It really was. I got lucky &amp; got it on my second roll.
---
they probably won't even tell us the game has died until 5 + years after it actually happens
---
Taimi literally has a line in Season 3 where she says "it starts with an S" i want to say it's episode 3, but it might be episide 2. 
---
All of the Dragon Lab sequences kind of meld together after a while.
---
Perhaps it's meant to be a throwback, something that could better positive for both vets and newcomers. Good lore is good :)
---
Exactly.  If they aren't working on it currently then it's not happening unless the game becomes viral or something which isn't  happening without major content.
---
I thought that section of the Magazine was "written" by Gorrik, not Taimi
---
&gt; decent challenge
---
Doubt it. Not only it will scale with the number of people, but is also meant to be done with total strangers with 0 preparation.
---
That's a pretty cool way of advertising something. It reminded me of PC Gamer revealing GW2 years ago. Which made me angry.
---
&gt; We know there are six Elder Dragons.
---
stated by ANet
---
&gt; There is no empirical evidence for the sea dragon
---
stated by Taimi
---
So basically they want to have their cake and eat it too.
---
Pretty sure we knew that?
---
This is just furthering the damage really
---
That would be very cool to see.
---
One thing I'm confused about though: wasn't the Cathedral of Flames historically of human origin? It seems then that there are actually Ascalonian ruins within the Charr homelands, at least according to GW1 wiki.
---
definitely HoT maps. when i used to look in the lfg i could barely find any PoF trains for bounties but i could almost always find a map meta for any of the HoT maps, add to that that the HoT maps require coordination and people actually paying attention instead of just facerolling everything in a giant burst of glowing eye cancer while pressing 1 constantly and it definitely seems like HoT is far more popular.
---
it would help if they just come out and said it instead of doing what high schoolers do and asking their friend to give their crush a note that asks them if they wanna go out sometime.
---
Anybody else finding this thing a nightmare to navigate and read? Having to re-scale and zoom into each paragraph then manually close to open the next few lines? Am I doing this wrong?
---
I wonder if they go back and let us fight Lazarus or Caudecus. Most likely not.
---
"Notes from the Field, written by Taimi"
---
Yes it was announced last Friday with a Icebrood construct.
---
I didn't check the subreddit and for a second I thought that would be a new monster for Monster Hunter...
---
But it looks great, wether it's Aurene or a monster :)

Everything is final.
---
Until Disney buys the franchise and runs it to the ground.
---
I mean does it matter? It’s a dragon we will eventually kill. It could be attracted to mountains and identify as a chart for all I care.
---
You every MMO gates content in expansions, right?
---
4 Discs of MUSIC?!?!!?!? 
---
My ears are ready!
---
And that's got what to do with this?
---
Huh 10 man cm of the last story chapter. They listend. The made story repeatable.
---
Very very good advertisment here. As a vocal cmritic of the game I feel it is important to give them credit for doing something right.
---
Also THANK YOU for not wasting dev time creating boss encounters and letting them languish as one time only content. If you approach strikes like this (and hopefully not limited to just end bosses but anything made with interesting mechanics) then I will be quite pleased.
---
Still need more raids, and dungeons... dungeons don't even have to be super hard. They are just nice to have in the world, season 1 had three fun essentially story mode dungeons but sadly they were temporary and only two got semi reworks as fractals... losing a huge amount of the dungeon at the same time.
---
On its own it would be merely subpar, but you have to take into the account that it was a game from franchise well know for the quality of writing.
---
I prefer to think that the two-domain thing is just a "too-clever-by-half" Asuran hypothesis. Think of very early versions of the Periodic Table, some of them look pretty stupid now.
---
Mordremoth doesn't need to have mind magic for the story to make sense. I just imagine that all of the dragons have "something" akin to the Dream, through which they control their minions. We just got unprecedented access to Mordremoth's "Dream" because we had the trust and communication of many disloyal dragon minions. The Pale Tree's dream is just the same mechanism by which all dragons control their minions, but mellowed out somewhat and probably not consciously controlled by the Tree anymore.
---
Cathedral of Flames were spoils of war. Which for some oddity included structures that got brought north and buried.
---
Despite it's name, it was more of a treasure vault of flames.
---
So I guess we may see *some* ruins, but it'd be in similar style as the Stormcaller Triumph monument in the Black Citadel.
---
This looks fucking awesome.
---
Years... literally years.
---
I want to find the dev/s who finally pushed this and give them some form of reward.
---
I know, just saw your name and thought this might fit together well.
---
Indeed, this isn't Autism. This is just infantile behavior.

Loch &gt; LN
---
This entire thing looks so cool! Is it a fanmade newspaper or what?
---
well look at WOW, and gw2 right now is still very strong.
---
honestly wow is still alive because of the nostalgia. tried classic a couple of days ago, garbage, just like the current game. if gw2 was the first mmorpg you wouldn't even hear about wow LOL
---
u/hinawerden looks like they are doing something like you suggested
---
It's meta for the elite skill slot on scrapper.
---
Well I have an i7 8700k with a gtx 1080sc and I can assure you they also drop in lions arch or divinitys reach. Alone in the open world I can see 120 fps and in LA I can see 30, teq I get about 20. This is with everything maxed like you want. 
---
I also see you keep getting back to "raids", most cities will bog you  down more then a raid will. 
---
I know you are looking for answers and I know you can not accept that max settings and 60 fps constant also means starring at a wall all alone. But that's the way the game is mate.
---
Yes but their % in reality is low and bringing them in close to every release is politics. However I don't mind as long as the story is well written mostly about fantasy and not about social problems left and right.
---
So I wasn't aware of this until I read it here, but even the Flame Legion are going to be peacefully represented at the summit? Whoa.
---
I guess we'll probably have a lot more tension than I expected.
---
Maybe someone can invite Gwen's ghost and reeeaaaally make things intense.
---
Let's hope raids didn't have to die for this, but I assume they did.
---
There's literally no correlation between those two things.
---
I don’t think they will actually ship out some disks.
---
Hopefully it's not just the end story boss with 9 times more hp but it has actually more tweaks to make it closer to raids or a challenge mote.
---
Okay, thx. Sure, it needs some adjustments and I do have some ascended gear, just not a full set.
---
I can't even begin to tell you how much poor documentation upsets me.  It's so simple to just take a few extra seconds to write down what you did and can save so much heartache... not only that but plenty of times I fix my own bad code before it bugs just because I paused to think about and document what I was doing and go "Oh... wait a minute... that's going to cause problems later.  Let me rethink this."  Number one pet peeve for sure.  
---
I don't disagree with faster release cadence, though... especially when talking bug fixes as opposed to, say, new feature roll-outs which I can understand why you might want to put off until you have a few to combine together and get people excited for.  There's honestly no reason, though, to hold off a long term bug fix until the next full release if you have it fixed now... especially with the way ANet deploys patches with no downtime.  They should honestly have a set roll-out time every day of the work week for the minor fixes (at least one if not two or three) to get deployed, tested and redeployed.
---
So heres the run down. Game isnt optimized for modern cpu and you are just finding out about the struggles of basically all the gw2 have had since day 1. 
---
You want maxed settings 60fps everywhere? Not possible. You need to compromise on some aspects or prepare to spend top of the line hardware; even then fps drops in big graphical situations. Currently the people with the best hardware have to make graphic sacrifices. 
---
The most influential is character model limit. I think thats what’s screwing you. Max graphics you can achieve with any mid range hardware but even the best stuff bend the knee to character model limit. Try putting all graphics on high and adjust limit to medium at the very least.
---
I have over 2000 hours in gw2 and I dont feel like playing the same content over and over again anymore (and I dont have the time and will to get into raids). But no matter how long this game runs I will be back every living world (or saga w/e) update because I just love the Guild Wars universe.
---
Probably 50% of the narrative team. 
---
As Deroir said, the story is trash. I will continue to rush through it and hope for some real, repeatable content.
---
Yes, I like the medium armor from there on one of my alts.
---
&gt;	Anet’s problem of not planning things in advance and sticking to it 
---
I really do love the game and ANet, and all the negativity here has really pushed me away from the sub lately...but this is one criticism that even for me is undeniable.
---
Maybe it's because it hits close to home for me, since I work at a place where my boss does this all the time... I'll be working on a project for weeks and then when I'm 90% finished, he will change his mind, usually on a whim, on something back at step one that forces me to start over.
---
Repeat that a few times and on the fifth or sixth attempt you just don't give a fuck about the project, the quality of your work, or any sort of timeline. You don't give a fuck because you *can't let yourself* become mentally or emotionally invested in your work. Because you've had to throw good work in the trash so many times.
---
Then when the boss comes by to try to inspire you to work harder/better/smarter/faster/whatever, the only reaction you've got left, even if you like them, the company, and the project, is "Yeah whatever. It would have been done and awesome months ago if not for your mismanagement. So you'll get it when you get it. I gave my last shit two quarters ago."
---
For ANet that means bugs, rushed stories, incomplete features, stuff that's promised but delivered years later, if ever, and a disproportionate focus on short-turnaround stuff...because it's the only stuff they can do that won't have all the joy sucked out of it by the time it ships.
---
10 player Balthazar raid boss would be amazing.
---
which content you are referring to?
---
...wasn't their relationship one of the accentuated parts during LS1? Down to it being a part of ending cutscene? ANet did focus on them. At least when it comes to sylvari, it makes sense in lore. This was just insulting to lesbian community as a whole, to reduce a detective and a daughter of a noble family fallen from grace, to token lesbians.
---
Partially for ads... partially because that is what the old gaming magizines it is trying to pretend to be did.
---
thats the strike mission you clown
---
Well you got wow, their expansion and classic tosses in free...there lots to chase in that game for vets ect.
---
Ffxiv just dropped a massive expansion, heaps to chase for vets too
---
Eso recently dropped their new expansion. Quality work.
---
All 3 have more monetization.
---
Then gw2....sure it's a buy to play, but all the stuff you'd otherwise chase in the three prior games is either cash shop or doesn't exist. 
---
You all tell me which of the 4 is in the worst spot here. Anet need to rethink its approach imo.  Chase missed opportunities with pvp and wvw, and regularly release new content, even if its sort of small and they keep adding to it
---
Also gw2 is the most,steam friendly of the 4, but aside from wow the only one not joining that party...b2p would quickly make gw2 a hit among the steam moms, both eso and ffxiv did very well there and they have subs which steam users detest.
---
Why make up ads (which they actually did) when you have legit ads to put in?
---
It wasn't that challenge mote was buggy, it's that the whole instance was buggy. 
---
It sounds like strikes are single bosses so they'll be shorter, and if you do run into bugs it'll be less punishing. On top of that, theoretically they're releasing less content at once so will have more time to test and fix it.
---
My head canon is that the Water dragon is associated with Secrets the way Abaddon was, and that everyone constantly forgetting its name is part of that magic.
---
Outstanding work of art &lt;3 lovely choice of colors too
---
&gt; lost a lot of respect from me there, ANet
---
So in the midst of a controversy that deals with ANet's tendencies of near-nonexistent communication and continued patterns of being out of touch with the community, including seeming to have no love for game modes outside the open-world, the *real deal-breaker* for you is the fact that some fictional scientists wanted to know more about the culture and social patterns of entities far greater than those we call "gods?"
---
Good to know your priorities are in order.
---
The majority don't care about the story that much. The draw of the game has always been its gameplay: the combat, movement and interaction with the world (area design). The other key being the lack of hassle involved in using these strengths. Easy to change builds, waypoints to get around the world and get to where you want to be,
---
Imagine having to post this because Noel is hated on reddit, owo
---
This is 100% political, we know Anet houses a lot of these loons and them wanting to shoehorn their politics in is nothing new.
---
Your use of dye is amazing looking, I need to try this on my ele now.
---
My theory is that we're going to channel dragon magic into other things as we go on. For instance end the icebrood saga with channeling magic into the spirits of the wild. Through this you create a new pantheon of gods to replace the old human onces and you set the world up for another chapter 1000 years into the future or something.

&gt; If you want to get into the top 99% again you honestly can't take long breaks from the game
---
This is false really, if you spend your time doing real gold value instead of trying to fake your numbers via a few niche items as you did, you can get to and stay at better than 99% for a long time.
---
I was rank 100 before without any of these stupidity, actual value that doesn't drop by millions in a minute, i am still above 99% after 2 years of break from making gold just raids and fractals sometimes.
---
sssh ... dont leak our secrets pls :)
---
A proper fight against Lazarus would be awesome. The actual one is kinda nice in a sense of storytelling but I wish this kind of foes would actually be hard to kill, even if it's an additional fight other than the easy one played in the chapter.
---
People who raid are likely pretty comfortable with WoW
---
The movement has pretty much been hijacked by the far left.
---
In Europe weve had police having to step in in prides because the gays that werent left wing werent welcome.
---
More like he is too busy playing WoW classic :)
---
I'm really excited for what little info we did get, but I think Anet made a huge mistake by not even hinting at anything more than they already gave us. I for one would feel loads better if we get just a blog post, tweet, or Reddit leaks about something like elite specs/icons or a character with a trident above ground. I can only assume they don't have anything to show us if they don't, given the number of Devs on social media who see how we are reacting.
---
I don't think they're gonna pull something like this but it would be awesome tbh
---
My main is Guardian (according to Gw2efficiency 3032/7690 hours). Usually play Firebrand in PvE and WvW though more of a WvW person. I have quite a bit of experience as Dragonhunter from before PoF but probably would be a bit rusty.
---
Second most played character is Engineer (1513/7690 hours). I usually do antitoxin scrapper in WvW. Just never got Holosmith right. 
---
Third most is Necro (979/7690). This is actually the first class I played and I'm pretty so-so with this. I usually do reaper in PvE for inexperienced groups, and rarely scourge in WvW. I wouldn't really say I'm too good at any of this.
---
The last class I have a good chunk of time on is Ele (658 hours). Mostly with tempest and quite well, much less so with weaver.
---
Finally, I'm pretty good with shooting mounts down with soulbeasts in WvW, for whatever that's worth, though I guess that's not particularly special.
---
And when everything’s on the table, (*sinister laugh*) ***nothing*** will be...
---
All of the dragons can reproduce aesexually via magic, and you're here like "lol there are only girls and boys you dumb SJW"
---
I think that most people on this sub would agree with that. But how would Anet even deliver something like that? A few hero points each map? That would take you a year+ to fully unlock any elite spec. Entirely out of the question. 
---
This then begs the question, if there really is no practical way to include elite specs in LS (or saga) releases, what did Mike Z mean by "expansion level content" all those months ago? The players are hanging onto this quote in the hope of elite specs, but this does not seem to be the case at all.
---
Oh god, I laughed so hard at that ad.
---
Just a little reminder about where they come from, nothing more.
---
Whales in gaming account for a large sum of the income for F2P games, so getting a large amount of players (and whales) back frequently has probably proven more lucrative for them than expansions if I had to guess.
---
So maybe GW2 has a loyal number of whales at this point, which can sustain their company well enough provided they just frequently grab their attention and offer them something to buy. If anything is less of a gamble than putting ~100 of people at work for two years and hope it it is received well (I prefer the latter approach).
---
But on another note, one positive thing about "sagas" though is that I interpreted it as teams having some creative freedom in creating their own storylines more freely. I hope they're like story packs where they don't necessarily have to feed into the one singular story. The end of a story could be something else than "kill dragon" based on which "saga" it is. Maybe it's about the political situation in the charr homelands? Or the fractal storyline spilling into the rest of the world? Or Moto's mystery game that has some deeper meaning?
---
As if we would ever sink that low, pfff
---
Maybe. But they showed a strike mission that was already finished for Episode 1/2. And explained one mission that will come in the later episodes. 
---
I don't get why they would skip this one.
---
They already have challenge motes on raids and many achievements for bosses that don't have them can be setup as the challenge mode. 
---
The only problem is that they are a one-and-done type of thing. If they don't want to split the playerbase across 3 raid-modes, the best way is to make the reward structure weekly where certain version of each raid or raid boss get the added rewards. 
---
I also don't think easy mode is by any means difficult to actually create per-boss. It's probably a matter of their concern over splitting player base and just building any LFG tools to make it actually easier.
---
All criticism if handled that way there. That’s why devs don’t come to reddit. They don’t want to see people not happy with their product.
---
I'm just surprised she didn't interview Shashoo, who is an officer of the Pact, for details. Or report the information gleamed from Omad's machine that she created a simulation for. She has actual data supporting its existance, just not very much.
---
He's not talking about the DSD being a folk tale, but about these possible "minion appearances" being folk tales. Because Tyria has basically no verifiable records of these minions either - they only know that something is chasing ocean dwellers closee to shore. 
---
This segment doesn't in any way conflict with established lore.
---
That part IS lore-friendly since it's a piece of Taimi's work on the Elder Dragons.
---
Lets not diagnose somebody on one interaction ok? Also, nice list, did you google it from Autism speaks? Its people like you who cause Autism to be seen as a bad thing. Just don't ok. You're not an expert so don't pretend you are.
---
Rip wow sucks anyhow.
---
They're fantasy creatures that reproduce aesexually via magic. You think it's weird that they're not obviously male or female? What gender do you think bacteria are?
---
For an MMO it's probably not considered that grindy but it still takes players who skip stuff [110+ hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/7rcw02/how_long_until_i_can_start_heavensward/dsw0v22) to get through it all? Apparently that's a lowball estimate too? I've played gw2 for thousands of hours but none of them required a subscription. To get to where FFXIV "gets good" I'm REQUIRED to play 100 plus hours minimum OR buy a skip in their cash shop. That's a huge grind dude and even they know it
---
You're getting mad over a fictional character wondering if an Elder Dragon has a similar sense of identity as an human being.
---
Can we please get a real album for Metal Legion?
---
Also, why are they not touring in the Grove? My Sylvari is mad.
---
No, I simply recognize that different teams have different jobs lol. Should the narrative team be subject to the criticism of the WvW Development or skill balance? I don't think so. Even you should be able to criticize the story or even PvP balance or Fractal development without needing to consider the wider game as a whole. Can you wrap your head around that?
---
You know. I love how they refer to Aurene as the Prismatic Dragon
---
That's some low effort drama.
---
Even my mom is asking when the next “big content payment” will be and she plays like a handful of times a month, at best
---
Dont they reusing stuff by using fractals? cant they do a mode for fractals for 10 ppl?
---
All I know is of the 4 bit mmorpgs, gw2 is the least developed of them all...but as somone said the black lion store seems very updated
---
Where is my IRL ad blocker?  Oh right, turn the page!
---
The reward for them and us will be lots of people playing/replaying them, and then getting more support for raids as a result.
---
It’s interesting they still refer to Mordy as the dragon of “Plant and Mind”, I thought they changed it to “Rot and Madness” from the Kralk final battle where we see the different facets representing the entities he had consumed
---
Stand in the sun
---
Jesus.... forget about it.
---
In the note, Gorrik basically wonders if Elder Dragons have a sense of gender identity or they just don't care. If it's the second one, it's pretty obvious that the more adequate way would be "it" or "they", probably the later given that they are actualy conscious.
---
It's not even politics, it's just basic grammar.
---
Vulgarity, insults and lies about a statement, nothing new in your club.
---
Wintersday is coming.
---
well you're allowed to be wrong. :) 
---
If you really think lack of gear progression is what killed the game you haven't been paying attention.
---
I agree. There's gotta be a mutually beneficial model in there somewhere. But the front-loaded expense is bound to discourage new players. We already have evidence of this through the many threads that have popped up in the past asking which expansion is worth getting because there's a really obvious concern over whether playing the game in chronological order or keeping up with the current story is more important.
---
With the bundle, this issue will go away, but it still might lead to "hey, how worthwhile are the living world episodes I missed?" Where a player needs to wonder if the core story of the game is worth their money.
---
I dunno, the idea of living world is revolutionary and as a regular player, I love it. But with the subject being tied more and more to what's a good business strategy (trying to offer constructive criticism instead of mindless anger), the more I realize Living World is a massive obstacle for anyone who hasn't been around from the start. Either you have to pay up or you have to do some serious research so you can bother to be emotionally invested.
---
And like, emotional investment is kind of important.
---
You still haven't answered my question. If you've gotta stay mad you might like at least to find a reason.
---
NA or EU?
---
Looks cool :)
---
&gt;I also dont get why you would find it negative that they are trying to sell their products to you through this medium, when everybody else seems to be telling Anet to expand/diversify their marketing/advertisement strategy.
---
That's a bit out of context. People are asking for Anet to diversify how they bring new players into the game. Selling leggings to already established players isn't what was being asked for
---
You fools. Waves of Shadow is a double April Fool's prank. It's gonna be the expansion after this living world
---
Ya, but what can they say at this point? If they cancelled Iceblood Saga and officially announced that they were working on expansion #3, would anyone be satisfied? Negative: they'd start demanding projected release date and feature previews. It's sensationalist consumerism. Everyone just wants a hype train to ride on. I've been there before and after a long while I realized what I was doing.
---
All I'm saying is let's step back, see what we get in Iceblood and make a rational decision on what each of is individually do next. Whether you want to quit, take a break or keep playing is up to you, but as long as we don't resort to the level that some of these faceless people on the internet have resorted to, I think we can accept the outcome of this upcoming content.
---
Also, I'm excited for Strike Missions and to see the Jormag tie in.
---
This is the real lore players are looking for
---
The face could be because she's not staring at straight ahead in the selection screen, but she is in-game. Try selecting something, a mob or another player, and angle your character. She will look towards the selected thing, so you might get that look where she's angling her head.
---
Nice to see an active raiding guild will continue to grow and interact with the community. As a more casual raid trainee, I appreciate being able to rely on more experienced veteran raiders for guides. Wishing you all the best of luck.
---
you have extra hero points in the game right now, almost enough to unlock another 2 elite specs
---
That doesn't proof anything.
---
The Destiny's Pledge ad. It's pretty much for a Logan x Rytlock fanfic book.

So you are researching about a nature force that can destroy the planet. Lets say you know which kind of gender they identify themselves because they told you so (cause that's the only way of knowing). Does this give you any kind of **useful** information? No it does not. Sorry to say this but different to social views how someone identifies themselves does not matter in science. You don't gain crucial information about a species with that knowledge. 
---
Lets say jormag identifies as woman. Does this tell you how she reproduces? No. Does this tell you how she behaves? No. This gives you nothing. She could identify as nature force and it won't give you information. So, no real scientist in the world would put any focus on that. Because I can't stress it enough from our viewpoint we don't get any insights from it.
---
It's increadibly more important to understand how it reproduces. Does it need a mate or can it asexuelly reproduce? If not it it's sex female and are the elder dragons related so they can reproduce. How were they able to exist so long? Why did the mix of magic drive kral insane. These are topics that are important and might help to reveal their aim. 
---
If the dragon sees itself as female but is in fact male gives you nothing. Even worse there is no way to find out without the dragon telling you so why bother. Are you gonna ask him? So and how will you do that cause different to movies and games it's highly unlikely you can just go up to it and it will understand your language. So rather put focus on how to communicate first before you tackle it's view on gender.
---
I only hope it is minimally challenging. I don't think it will be but it would be a really nice addition to have those extra fights around.
---

Yes - The evading lenght isn´t affected by movementspeed as you can see here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUz1YHzcu-o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUz1YHzcu-o)
---
I really agree with all of your points about the personal instance. Giving us meaningful unlocks for our personal instances gives me a sense of progression and this feeling like I'm building my own personal space. It's not quite player housing as we'd expect but it's not too far off either!
---
"Supp chrono is harder than dps" :)))))
---
See, the thing is it's difficult to tell if the expansions did anything to keep quarterly revenues on an "acceptable level". I'm putting myself in the shoes of the stakeholder at ANet and looking at the chart and I'd think, the release of expansions have not reversed the downward trend at all.
---
As a business, it's irresponsible to not start diverting resources to developing new products for growth.
---
Reason why I know this is because I'm in a studio with only one, albeit formerly successful game. As the game ages, it's imperative to develop the next flagship product. We don't have the repute and muscle of ArenaNet so when we sunset our current live game we can't even do a minimal once per 3 months living world episode. The non communication and lack of road map is par for course so as to not scare aware current spenders.
---
The burning statue in the announcement video made me sit up and think: that's flame legion. Couple that with Bangar's mate having issues with Rytlock... I suspect we're in for a flame legion rebirth
---
I mean that's irrelevant so okay?
---
They showed the boss and some of its actions. And the strike missions are basically boss encounters.
---
I guess it is anecdotal, but I'm the point in case for someone that *did* do the research and became emotionally invested enough to buy the stories. Perhaps I'm the exception and not the rule, but it bears consideration as to whether the model itself encourages more players to invest in the story as opposed to discourages them.
---
On a side note, I hate to throw flak but I feel like I have to after some analysis of the player base. Some of the attitudes of some players remind me of the forum warriors of WoW. Back when I was super invested into WoW I remember rambling posts about min/maxing and game balance. These players looked at the game as less of a game and more of a dick measuring contest. I was a pretty hardcore raider back then as well and I definitely participated in a few of those threads. Topics like "which expansion is more worthwhile" makes me recall those days, where people would tell you not to bother playing a certain class due to a 1% performance differential at max performance specs. Both expansions were always worth getting in GW2, and aside from a limited budget I can't think of a reason why you wouldn't get all the expansions before now. This question feels very gw2 centric due to the fact that the expansions aren't required in the same way WoW expansions were. Anyway, I'm way off topic now but I just wanted to stop and address the possibility that a small minority of the complaints we are seeing are possibly coming from WoW minded people. I know at least one friend of mine that I've brought in recently was upset because he could be geared by paying someone to carry him through a raid for loot drops. I still haven't quite broken through to him that that is an entitled mentality.
---
Why did they delete it though? I don't think it's anything really overpowered
---
We have Aurene. Understanding her ascended state and the species she is a part of is important.
---
Also, you seem to be implying that biology is the only field of research that matters. Societies, cultures, psychology and the inner workings of the mind; all of these could be benefitted through asking these kinds of questions. Is it of utmost importance in the face of destruction at their hands? Not really. But understanding one's enemy, maybe even to the point that diplomacy can be reached, or at the very least understanding our ally who shares a similar nature to these creatures, that's all pretty important.
---
I get where you're coming from. Things like this can feel tangential at best and blatantly pandering at worst. But the context of this detail is in regards to the natural curiosity of young researchers attempting to thoroughly understand what has remained a mystery for millennia. Of all the places this line of questioning makes sense, this is it. It's not being thrown in your face, it's being added organically.
---
I was raised in a super conservative household. I know how this looks. But don't just take the knee-jerk reaction to it. Look at how it's presented and judge it based on that.
---
And now allegations, is that all you got to defend your point of view ? The " good " side uses strange methods, I'm probably not angry enough.
---
Yeah but as a hardcore pvp player missing out on that expansion is quite annoying as hell
---
Yes, this is a big assumption on my part. Yet assuming it was 100% focus of resources on ArenaNet's part to develop GW2 pre POF. Now see that there's been no reversal of a long term downward trend in revenue after 2 fully focused expansions. If you owned the business, would you not recognize the impossibility of fighting against the aging of the game?
---
Shes refering to the words of sailors from cantha and elona of creatures emerging from the sea.

ALWAYS test production releases - ALWAYS.
---
By cut content he means that a full set of legendary weapons were promised but didn't happen, not that content was hated behind the expansion.
---
If you can't keep up with the blob you can always go around and kill one or two guards outside of the keeps and towers, you don't have to hit the lord to get credit as long as it's your team who flips it. Also not sure if you knew, but SM doesn't count as a keep so don't hang around for that if you are still trying to get your keep flipping achievement. Sometimes it's worth asking in the chat too, there might be smaller pug roaming groups around willing to lend you a hand in other maps outside of EBG.
---
Ty much appreciated!
---
The alternative is making them mostly useless like racial skills currently are. Either way it would be a balancing nightmare for little to no gain.
---
NA, I got it thank all so much.
---
Apparently good enough for them to not wanna make expansions anymore.
---
Bullshit. I see players mention WoW and other games all the time on the forums, even saying things like they would like to see GW2 have features that other games have or that other games do certain things better.
---
But you're the first player I've ever seen claim to have been suspended for merely mentioning another MMO.
---
You either said something really stupid, or racked up infraction points in a short amount of time for repeated rules violations.
---
This is really good. I'm getting much better FPS over all. Is there a built in hot key that allows the program to confim its up and running smoothly. I can normally only tell from a visual perspective.
---
I would also like to cut out some of the screen drawing/pop in issues by utilising more ram. I looked at your guide but I was not confident as to what to change values to you. Does you or anyone else have some sample adjustments that might improve things. My running Ryzen 5 2500 OC to 38.5khz, 16GB RAM, GPU Radeon Sapphire Nitro+ RX 590 8GB
---
Over all awesome work.
---
Incidentally anyone still trying to get the other modes to work in conjuction with this. I found this exact method seems to work:
---
install d912pxy by extracting to root GW2 folder then using the install folder within
---
rename d3d9.dll to d912pxy.dll in Bin64 folder
---
Install Reshade and change d3d9.dll to dxgi.dll
---
Move it to the root folder with the GW2 exe
---
GW2 Radial: rename file to d3d9_chainload.dll 
---
save in Bin64
---
ArcDPS: copy d3d9.dll to Bin64
---
You do realize things tested in a controlled test environment can work fine, but break once introduced to the live environment, right?...because I don't think you do.
---
&gt; tp flipping
---
More for TP speculation than instant flipping.  Like stockpiling a material in anticipation for a new sink being introduced, without taking up as much bank space.
---
It's a huge selling point with my friends. "We can get all of this game play for...free?!"
---
Give them the first of 20 items in a multi-stage collection while you're at it.
---
Perhaps the testbed is missing some updates.  
---
One dev mentioned he can run the entire server stack on a single PC.  So, it should be a matter of running the release script every time in a VM of the production game.
---
“U even steal my horns which u dont have” and “u r worthless like ginger”

What?? LOL

They should have announced this alongside, holding it back until now did them no favors.
---
You haven't read many magazines, have you...
---
I think Norn transformations would be ok if they lasted a little more or were just an aesthetic choice for combat.
---
Norn in GW1 shapeshifted a lot when entering a fight and it was really cool tbh.
---
Thanks :D
---
Kralk really should have been Crystal and Prophecy. He and His children were all prophets who could glimpse the future.
---
Hehe thanks o/
---
Thank youuu :3c
---
Sharur would like a word with anet first.

Oh XD

In fact I never played Monster Hunter, I should once, but that's funny !

Ohh thank you so much ;w; !

Using the alt-right card against the true left, you guys really can't stop joking.

It must be awful to live in your two facets world.

I dunno if I should be shocked or not about the fact that there are people out there who don't know what a magazine is or how they operate. Am I too old at 29?
---
Can confirm, 4 discs, 78 tracks.
---
One night not to fear.
---
almost as if gw2 is a sequel to gw1 made by the same company 🤔
---
I totally missed the days of GW1, but like you, became invested enough to go back and play it. But even before I played it myself, I also became emotionally invested through research. So I totally feel you there.
---
My issue is that GW1 is a totally different game. Reading up on GW2 events to get emotionally invested doesn't seem like it should happen to a player, because it's *right there.* And then, with the expansions, players are still experiencing parts of it, but not necessarily others.
---
Maybe there is justification for the power of lore and letting people get invested through reading, but it still feels like the history of the game has been set up in a way that really isn't optimal for new players, especially when new players are the focus of marketing.
---
Maybe I bought into the whole "no, you have to *experience it*" mentality, and that might not be the best approach.
---
I started laughing my ass off to the point I took a walk outside my doctor's office to stop. Coming back and people looking at me like I'm high.
---
Then I sat and start smiling like crazy while reading... 100/10 would act like I'm high on drugs again on public for another masterpiece like this.
---
- "we're holding off on raids because we've dedicated those resources to strike mission design,"
---
- "elite specializations are in the brainstorming phase and you can expect an update on it from us after the saga"
---
 - alternatively: "expect the spirits of the wild masteries to further enhance your gameplay in current content, as we have added prayer sites to attune your character to a spirit, aiding you in battle"
---
Stuff like that. I'm not saying I don't want the living world update, I absolutely love it. I just want a reason why the original 300 people, what weren't working on mobile and got laid off, has presented us with vague information with hints on things they promised us months ago and gave us nothing really new other than story aspects.
---
I don't wanna have to wonder why it took so long to get the thing they said they were gonna do. I'd rather have them tell me outright that they don't have any more chocolate fudge for my sundae than put some other topping that i wasn't told they would put instead.
---
Because it's something to consider.  I know many of you don't know what that is, but there it is.
---
I love how they finally let us know the secondary influence for the other dragons. Up until now we know only Zhaitan's and Mordremoth's. Shadow and Mind respectfully. But I never would have guessed that Kralkatorrik was Fury and Jormag was Persuasion or Conflagration for Primordus, though that last one seems boring. Dragon of Fire and ... Fire?
---
If they made wing 7 Even easier it was because like u said the avarage player consider that content too hard to be interesting . So raid community was larger but not as much as you think if they are moving in this direction
---
You don't say. Here i thought GW2 was a sequel to Splatoon.
---
other than very large cities which I get 30 fps I'm suppose to get 60+ even on maxed everywhere else, as you just explained.
---
I can't get 30 fps in LA with my i5 6400 and then move to your i7 8700k and still get 30 fps which you say you get, this doesn't make any sense in terms of how computer hardware works, you should check to fix your game first.

Man this really feels like they're setting up Steve as some deep-ass Cthulu shit and I really hope that's what it is because I would *love it*

This is so pointless.... And this kind of stuff it the exact reason why community from raid is considered toxic. I have nothing to show to you and no one else .
---
Bah
---
Digital gem prices didn't change, so any shortage of stocks or retail price changes are just demand changes on the secondary market.
---
Gold -&gt; Gem ratios have gotten more expensive recently, so it's probably just that more people are interested in buying gems which created a shortage.
---
To each their own. This is an incredible game with a lot of potential. I'd pay for the content I want and am not receiving. This game at it's full potential is WORTH a sub fee. And hey, tons of players are leaving to play games with sub fees as we speak.

\^ They are right you know.
---
And T4 is not Facebook or not so many ppl would-be still in lower tiers..
---
Yeah they lost players because they made the community wait and felt disapointed by the actual quality of the wing. You dont need easier wings to get people into raiding the existing ones do just that for the purpose of training runs.
---
That's the problem. Even if you view it full screen, the thing has a terrible resolution and you're still forced to zoom parts one by one despite the fact that the text before zooming is big enough (if it wasn't blurry).
---
I just read nothing from this crap and came back here hoping anything important would be highlighted in comments, and hoping anet doesn't do it again and goes back to normal blog posts or normal release web pages.
---
it was announced, they said on stream that some story instances will be part of the strikes, and that there will be new strike this episode.
---
Right, I'm the one that's wrong, that's why this games population dropped off a cliff a month after release because people got bored and never recovered, and it's why the game was mocked when they came out with raids with nothing in them.
---
Like I said originally, GW2 fanboys killed this game and here you are still contributing to its death, absolutely fucking delusional.
---
Sounds like it isn't "ruled in" either. Which is more likely when it comes to spending millions of dollars making something, verse not spending anything.
---
Fanfiction.net?
---
Yes it is, it is incredibly easy. The reason you think its not is because T4 is the highest threshold of your player skill. If you want to do sonething challenging you should do 99/100 CM.
---
thx i did know that and today run went quite well.
---
Actually was in a group with 3 supports wich was fun but it let me focus on boon sharing and might was overflowing.^^
---
the over days i had some trouble getting she 5 stacks of fervor fast (against little mobs for expample) but it isn't a gamebreaker so i don't rly care about that for now.

No you're not. I don't rly understand why people are all going "I'm usually a vocal critic but this is great way to go anet". Wtf. I'm usually a vocal defender against many critics I deem either baseless or overrreacted, and today I'm definitely the one going "wtf why did they do this".
---
The truth is youre actually just bad but you dont want to acknowledge it. I asked for you to post a log of your dps not your bank information. But by all means leave i had a grasp of your player skill when you said T4s were hard for you

Maybe he means the actual ginger root ingame which you can't sell, therefore it's worthless?

Bug in game: "Don't Worry, we will look into it Soon™"
---
Bug in store: "ALL HANDS ON DECK! GET IT FIXED NAO!"
---
What seems lazy is that Anet is clearly trying to push the water dragon out of the lore (until now its existence was not hypothetical at all) to get rid of it, because they don't know what to do with it, because the people who knew left the company, because they want to avoid underwater content ...
---
I was like meh...
---
But then I actually liked it
---
The issue is that gw1 has heroes which make it very fun to play solo and to make builds on it.
---
I want Aurene/:
---
Yeah, no... that's not the way it works.
---
"I don't think we have an answer for that one \*\*yet\*\*" gives the impression that they didn't think about expansion which implies that they weren't aware the community is willing to pay for an expansion. Especially following up with   “I think the important thing here, obviously, is that everyone at the studio knows that there’s a demand for an expansion. So it’s not like we’re ruling it out.”  cannot more plainly show "we didn't know you wanted an expansion so we didn't even consider making one, until now"
---
Yeah but the players are starting to.
---
At least release the various pieces of an expansion in pieces?
---
Sometimes Primordus little fire. Sometimes Primordus BIG fire.
---
For me its easily the best addition to the game. It was the reason I returned for HoT and gave me something to work towards.  I met a group of like minded people and formed a static group, we spent countless hours hanging out in raids learning and getting better as a group. I still remember learning Dhuum and the stupid chart I made for the timings to go up and do orbs,  it was basically the most fun I have had in gaming ever. We havent played gw2 together since wing 6 came out and it kinda breaks my heart, we have a discord and play other things together but its kinda not the same.
---
Yeesh. The most optimistic part of this is that they are aware of the demand. Otherwise this makes it painfully obvious that there are no current plans for X-Pac 3.
---
This game is so old that they still ship it via disc! I wonder how many floppies it would take
---
&gt; hard mode story instances 
---
Things like Balthazar, Bugged Potato Dragon and many more fight could make some really good team fights imo. Those story missions really have so many assets that can be turned into different content
---
I'm optimistic. My rationale is that they are making Strikes as an introduction to raids and raid mechanics. If they didn't plan to make raids/hardcore content, then why would they be wasting developer time making these "entry level raids encounters"? If we buy the line the pessimists spin about ANet only caring about personal story PvE players who can't complete the story without having their hand held all the time, then Strikes don't make any sense. If ANet really just wants raids to die, then they would just put this energy into making more living world chapters. I think they've recognized that the 10-man change was a stupid idea that makes it harder to find players to play with. Rather than doing the really hard work of undoing that and making raids 5-man, they go for the easier route of providing a low-stakes way of getting people into 1-man scenarios.

---
3. How does this have any kind of relation that some bugged affected your AT?
---
Be nice to Ben, he is like the only one at Anet that actually cares.
---
Nah mmorpgs were the trend once wow took off like wildfire.  Them every company wanted to make one, they all failed but a few...
---
Then it was moba games
---
Then survival sandbox
---
Then BR
---
Mmorpgs are way too expensive to make and maintain and when most didn't get wow number companies stopped making them. 
---
There won't be a gw3...so I feel confident anet is devoting all resources into gw2...so they have to get results, NC soft does shut down studios and,anet definately not working on a backup game
---
&gt;  I need 60 fps at least when I'm just sitting in town and farming, this isn't about massive raid parties with tons of blowing up on screen at the same time.
---
[Here is the exact component list of my PC.](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/graven2002/saved/#view=pZmvnQ)  I have graphic settings maxed, and the performance meets this threshold.  Granted, I have it plugged into a 1080p 60hz TV not a 4k monitor, and resolution has a large impact on performance.
---
[Single Thread Performance](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html) is the best benchmark I've found for GW2.  I would trust the Intel chips on that list more than the new Ryzen ones for now, until more ratings results come in.
---
I also wouldn't recommend getting an Intel chip older than the 8th generation, that way your new Motherboard is more likely to support future CPUs.
---
I don't think it's weird that dragons are not obviously male or female, I think it's weird that it somehow matters in the narrative without any reasons being given for it to matter **within the narrative**. For example, they could ask the question of how Glint was able to lay an egg - that would be an organic way to weave identity into the narrative. But asking Jormag about how Zhaitan and Mordremoth identify? The two dead ones?
---
Why would you jump to the conclusion that I must think non-binary identity is weird if I simply think the issue (and their baffling approach to it) doesn't fit the current narrative? Shame on you for your prejudice of what my positions "must" be on identity.
---
The obvious answer is to stop winning. /s
---
But are you retarded?
---
How to create content that can fill the gap between Raid release ! Well done Anet
---
Better atmosphere? Maybe.... but most things are repeated on PoE, way way more than D3, especially the second half of the story.
---
However, the writing, outside of a few lore notes (which I admit I enjoyed were very cool, especially in the first chapters where they are voice acted, not many games where you find NZ mythos!), is pretty bland, and most characters are super forgettable. D3 isn't going to win any prices on writing, but the characters, stereotyped as they were, are easy to remember and they have their moments.
---
Autism is a bad thing when it causes difficulties to people. Simple as that.
---
Taimi's line, the first time we found about the "S" was in the archives.
---
What am potato dargon?
---
Not much, I agree. It has none of quality immersive writing, it's all high fantasy bullshit that doesn't really make you forget it's all to justify mechanics, but that's exactly why you can spot token minorities and hamfisted elements better. Their orientation was put on pedestal, and everything else wasn't even in the background. It was LITERALLY the only character development for them. Butch necro is still secretive and smug, femme mesmer is still a fragile wallflower who gets hickup attacks. No lore on their backgrounds, no lore on their classes, no impact on the plot whatsoever, and their PoF/LS4 parts are more focused on their relationship than any other trait they might have.
---
This is a travesty of writing. Look at fucking DA:I, look at how brilliantly Dorian was written (Sera was an unlikable potato faced cunt, but it was more of an entirety of her character, not orientation). If they want to score some diversity points, can't they at least make some fucking effort?
---
Astral and the Heroic Dragonblood weapons are of ascended rarity so that might be why they're so tough to get.
---
While i'm let down by the announcement, I must say I'm pretty exited by the level of polish this upcoming content is getting. Nothing like season 3/4
---
Don't blame the QA team, trust me whatever issue you have, they found. 
---
The issue is usually the dev team don't fix it in time.
---
Cuts to the Dev team / restructuring will cause tons of bugs. 
---
New Devs on new areas = bugs 
---
99% of bugs that the players see are know issues. 
---
Just some producer waived them pushed the build regardless
---
The codes anet gives to partners are more like a reward for the content they produce; i don't think they are required to give them to the community. Maybe some partners can clarify this.
---
I'm just showing you where their poiorities lay. The only ppl actively playing pvp and not taking it as a joke are left in the dark. They don't care we keep missing our rewards WEEKLY, the only thing that matters is mass scale marketing.
---
I'd never heard about the archives before today. I just remembered the line from Taimi in Season 3
---
Sure buddy...
---
&gt; with 9 other players
---
&gt; I suspect this is what the strike things will be then
---
with up to* 9 other players
---
They also mention Ascalonian archiecture on the GW1 wikipedia page in exert from an official description of the dungeon. It seems pretty confusing to me, especially as there are pictures of Ascalonian ruins in the latest GW2 photos of the zone.
---
just gonna be frostie 2.0
---
&gt; we probably can expect a new expansion in 2 years at the earliest
---
There won't be another expansion. GW2 is in maintenance mode and Arenanet's in the design phase for their next game.
---
Cabbage Dragon
---
Yes it does. You must misremember, oil meta is always bottom plate and keep meta is always top.
---
Salad dad
---
Why?  Typically story missions award an achievement and a Mastery point, but that's it.  Why would I want to re-experience that fight again with 2-9 friends?
---
Gave countless words of feedback to Ben, reported countless amount of wintraders, countless amouint of bugged ATS, people missing rewards. In the grand scheme nothing gets done. Just beacuse they have a figure to market as a good guy that's disconnected from the company doesn't mean he gets anything done. He doesn't. Just being a nice guy doesn't cut it for anyone after years of negligence.
---
Where my hard mode Caudecus at?
---
The information included is relevant to the point of the article though, players want expansions or expansion quality content relates to arenanet's comments. Specific features are unimportant as long as we know the communities opinions compared to the comments anet made
---
This is pretty neat.
---
Issue is the, a lot of the time the  in-game skins they add just look plain weird/bad and have really boring and tedious acquisition methods.
---
it would be funny if it had just read "Sixth" and Taimi only caught the S
---
Oh damn, that would be awesome :0
---
This is all that needs to be said =(
---
Any other point besides comparing gw to an inferior game?
---
No it is NOT. You are being ableist and mean.
---
But assuming there is an achievement, after that, why bother?  Story missions themselves award achievements and mastery points, but no loot.  Unless there are additional rewards available, why would I want to re-fight the same boss with a larger group?
---
I know it's to be expected from Anet, but what's up with this vague response? From this response it's safe to just assume there's no xpac in the future.
---
thanks for the info...
---
god damn it, I will probably need a new mother board otherwise the new cpu might get bottle necked. might as well buy an entire new pc at this point XD
---
&gt; They also included one fake/fictional advert, for the tyrian tour of the Metal Band.
---
Also the fake advertisement for the charr/human romance novel.
---
Veggiewyrm
---
My pleasure. I've now added a filter by character name.
---
Just because toxic white-knighting is the trending phrase right now doesnt mean I'm being toxic lmao. Chill out dude, maybe I misinterpreted your text, and that's fine, just let me know.. like.. in a civil manner?
---
i was waiting the whole time for hot story to start, but then it ended
---
Looking at my PC, I can't see where one would fit in those round flat circle things?
---
&gt; If Anet wanted to make a magazine celebrating their game, it should have included tongue-in-cheek advertisements for stuff like Krait Oil and Lavish Asuran Getaways.
---
Just in case you missed it, the [GW2 Artist Collective is doing exactly that as their next project](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tyrian-gazette).
---
Well, Anet did say that the ice brood construct would progress in the next chapter.  I am hoping (despite the fact that Anet has not told us this), that maybe they are planning to progress him by adding mechanics each time until he becomes a full raid boss.  I know I'm probably setting myself up for disappointment.
---
Yeah. we have to remember too that the Quaggan didn't just show up on the shores yesterday either, it was a few generations ago. Anything they know about the DSD is secondhand stories from grandquaggan at this point.
---
Plus, the Quaggan weren't directly chased out of the depths by dragon minions, as I recall. They were chased out by the Krait, who were fleeing even deeper waters because of the dragon. The Quaggan just have the sense that the Krait were scared of something. I might be remembering that part wrong though.
---
Tribune *Gritlock.* Why is this so damn funny to me?
---
So gay furry action is now canon?
---
Depends, 5.25 or 3.5?
---
As I said... I don't expect it. And if it is true, it would be pretty stupid of them. But I don't think it completely impossible. And while I agree that the anouncement was a fuckup on their part, I'm not salty about it - mainly because I was away from the game for quite some time and I have content to do aplenty... so there is no reason for me to be in denial.
---
primordus being the elder dragon of Fire and Big Fire is just a little bit goofy imo
---
For open world i use 2 different sets. A viper set if I’m doing scepter. 
---
Trailblazer and rabid for axe and staff with torch. Makes it way more tanky and still does ridiculous amounts of damage. Because staff is a godsend. 
---
Trailblazer for wvw too. 
---
As for fractals...up to you. I bring the tanky set because sometimes I get overzealous using up all my dodges to boost damage and not actually dodging stuff.
---
And it was still the single best content package the game has ever seen 
---
:V
---
It's the free trial that turned me off the game actually. I want to love it. (Pugilist is something I want for gw2 super badly) The levelling experience is largely mediocre though. It's just tons of fetch quests (pre 35). My wife and I played for hours and only saw one quest with a story of any kind and we couldn't even group up to share progress because levelling and exploration with friends isn't a thing in FFXIV apparently. Combat was decent though. I've played multiple classic final fantasies through to completion. I love the franchise and the reviews saying that Shadowbringers was like single player FF quality are why I tried to get into FFXIV at all. That story is stuck behind a middling levelling experience though. Play FF 6,7,10 etc. Do they make you grind your ass off at the beginning of the game? No. You don't even see the open world in 7 until you've played for HOURS. The grind is at the END. I don't think playing "meh" content for 100+ hours is worth the investment. If the game ever puts ARR on full FTP I'll finish it to try the expansions but I'm not gonna do so while they're charging me for my time doing so.

---
They already said Drakkar would be in the season as a world boss during the announcement
---
I just step on the glowy pink circle and press 'f'.  Seems a lot faster imo.
---
Snowcrows is probably not the best place to go for general builds as they seem to focus primarily on Raid Metas. Metabattle would be better for a variety of builds based on game type.
---
Longbow + Beserkers works well for general ranger with a Axe/Axe or Sword/Axe, IMO. Take a look here for several builds for different modes and modify to your style: [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Ranger](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Ranger)
---
The hidden fee for literally all gem-locked story content is playing the game with any degree of a farming mindset for less than two weeks
---
I have Guild Wars 2 installed on my SSD, are there other ways to increase/speed up load times?
---
What if DSD is actively hiding, indoctrinating people or even have real influence in world politics?
---
Coming in Episode 2 I believe.
---
Pre-nerf Caudecus was wild. I duoed it and was proud of ONLY using 2 repair canisters.
---
Nah, it's just gay furry fanfic, most likely. Neither Blizzard nor J.K. Rowling are in charge of writing plot for GW2, so I wouldn't expect this kind of development in the near future.
---
And yet we also have other examples which does use Test servers/realms and still ship things that are broken as hell. Lord of the Rings Online is a great example.
---
/r/guildrecruitment is where you should ask
---
What about the giant crater that kralkatorrik left when he awoke? Might we finally get polymock now that we are heading north again? What about the dungeons that we once tore apart in GW1.
---
That would be fantastic! Love to see that terrifying beast.
---
I mean, there's nothing particularly saying that the next saga couldn't still have Jormag be the overarching plot point, but now focusing on something other than the icebrood.
---
Okay this is really cool, Anet!
---
...obviously? Living world seasons/sagas (which will absolutely be longer and more stretched out, especially if they're developing an xpac in the background) generally run a little under 2 years judging by past incarnations. Somehow I doubt they'd drop an expansion right in the middle of a season.
---
All it takes is a competent dev studio to make it work.
---
...you know what, you're right. PTRs are wasted effort on GW2.
---
GTX 1070 and Ryzen 7 2800X....
---
Oh please. Do even understand the term maintenance mode? The fact that new content is coming proves the game is not in maintenance mode. A game -actually- in maintenance mode, like original guild wars, receives 0 updates, save the occasional bug fix.
---
I think the willingness of the PR dude to step in and say "everyone at the studio knows people want an expansion" speaks volumes.
---
With Revenant's implementation, we're not going to see utility/elite skills tacked on, unless it goes through a change that allows more than their super tiny skill set to come through per legend.  
---
But if so, we might see racial skills come back to them, even if they're not that useful.
---
Also think what you want to do. PvE is big and a casual open world guild is a totally different experience from a hardcore raiding guild (if there are any left).
---
You might try /r/guildrecruitment
---
NCSoft needs to go in and clean house in the management department and bring people in who are willing to help build the game back up to where it should be. Honestly it is only 7 years old and compared to other MMO's it is still a fledgling.
---
Fact is those in charge clearly have lost their passion for this title and in the end it needs new invigorated leadership. This is a normal transition in business, most CEO's last 5 to 7 years then get changed out so new perspectives can be initiated to help grow the company. Anet is long past needing a clean flush and hire people who are enthused about GW2 and want to seize the growth opportunities and maximise the potential for all areas including PvE, PvP and WvW. 
---
The time is now, while the game still has some life and passionate player base!
---
I loved that fight! 
---
Was pretty disappointed when I had to help a friend through and the platform just wouldnt start spinning unlike i remembered... Such a cool idea, but I get why it made people nauseus
---
only if you're playing at the time the LS is released.  If you take a year off and miss the initial release of the LS, then you have to buy those episodes.  in fact, there was a sale on past LS seasons over labor day.  If it's free, then I shouldn't have to pay for it if I'm not playing during that time frame.
---
I don't see that as expansion level content. Heck, the mini-raid was in the last two festivals- content available in to all players. Dragonbash even had a group que option.
---
It would be extremely unusual to release an expansion 6 years after the previous one.  Might be unprecedented.
---
Sure no problem. When you want it delivered?
---
sure, that is certainly a factor. but you can't argue away that the majority of recent filler event had rather basic bugs. chances of this just being a coincidence become rarer with each one. and while that doesn't mean they didn't test them, it does get embarrassing when so many of them straight up don't work.
---
Duuuuude I was expecting a different result when I opened the transmog. Cool setup &lt;3
---
i've read this one before!  in Divinity's Reach map chat.
---
It's called GW1.  Still perfectly playable.
---
Well, in this example the jp itself is probably even faster than searching for something outside, but I just like to get there in a unusual way.
---
Gritlock Brimstud actually does sound like a charr porn name. 
---
Oh lord, now I'm trying not to picture charr porn. 
---
I have decided to tell myself charr porn is just reenactments of great moments in charr history, like the "there are no gods!" scene in Eye of the North or the triumph of Kalla Scorchrazor. That or chasing each other up trees while screeching at the top of their lungs, like lynxes.
---
They could do that as events, a no elite specs event.
---
We knew they had second domains, but not what those domains were, except for Zhaitans and Mordremoths ones
---
I've building my own pc for years, tho I've been doing so without a cooling system other than a fan so ye...
---
problem are the parts, buying 1 or 2 is fine but this will require like 75% new computer, and parts aren't cheap here. can't even order online, the tax will murder me.
---
Gw1 and gw2 are fundamentally different games.
---
I think you misunderstood.
---
I hope not. While I think this is plausible one dragon having power of all of them is a boring story in my opinion and skips the most interesting part of the story(what will we do with all the free magic?) with a deus ex machina(aurene).
---
sorry, i didnt know that someone would want to consume more than 7 whole stories of RytlockxLogan fanfiction, two of which have explicit sexual descriptions and another with more than one pairings.
---
you are more than welcome to write more.
---
Personal hot take: if in May, after LS4 end, I knew that an expansion is coming, I wouldn't have minded to wait until late 2019 or even early 2020 with just what we have now - flavor events and festivals. And I would've preordered the expansion. And I would've kept buying gems. And I would've stayed away from ranting in my personal media. Oh well. :/
---
I can see it now... ~~Ash~~ Ass Legion and Captain Rogan*gbang*
---
The writing team has already gone full gay, and quietly full trans, but I think they'd draw the line at full furry. They've doubled down on Rytlock and Logan being bros, complete with Rytlock roasting Logan in Dragonfall and Logan defending Rytlock to Gwen's ghost (who then takes Rytlock's side in repudiating the human gods, to Logan's chagrin).
---
Huh, they used Guild Wars font... nearly got me interested there
---
While we may not all share the same politics, but you WILL treat all people with respect while in this sub. Any form of harassment or hate speech towards any gender or sexual orientation is against our rules and will result in temp or permanent bans without question or appeal.
---
Now I want to play GW1 again...all it takes is the music. What a great game it was...
---
Plot Twist:  The Dragon Krulkaturik attacks the Prison...
---
I congratulate you to your guild, seriously. But in terms if representativity gw2efficiency is probably a little bit better than any single, or even a small group of guilds.
---
Healers specifically do not have rotations because they need to respond to drops in the party's HP. **It is more important that they be familiar with a boss's attacks and animations so they can pre-cast accordingly.**
---
Other than that, they usually have a boon priority. Might for druids, quickness for healbrand, possibly alacrity for healgade?
---
Agreed. 
---
Aadditionally, Anet can't even fix what's wrong with GW2 and they want to move on to another game?
---
With their reputation in tatters atm,  that next big project better knock the fan's socks off.
---
This is the internet, you knew the intended word so it doesn't matter.
---
What would be the alternative? Making everything so easy that there is no challenge in anything? That would be boring.
---
Reread the previous comment, he said kormir writes them, not read
---
Though you could say she cant read her own horror
---
No, but they shouldn't encourage to have a fistful of huge guilds but many little ones. Heck, they could even scale the price to the number of members.
---
Omg it's amazing! I hope you dont mind if I use it for my desktop..
---
I think the person making this is just doing it for fun in their free time, I've mainly seen it on the gw1 subreddit
---
It objectively did.
---
Not you again
---
I wound up dyeing it to look like metal so my melee soulbeast looks like a heavy armor profession now.
---
This game project isn’t about replacing Guild Wars or making a better version of it, it’s simply a fan project made purely for fun.
---
The mechanics and game style is nostalgic for people who grew up playing games like Bauldur’s Gate, Diablo, Fallout, etc. and jRPG’s. It combines those game styles with the Guild Wars world.
---
&gt; What about the giant crater that kralkatorrik left when he awoke?
---
That's why it's "Grothmar *Valley*" now, instead of "Grothmar Wardowns".
---
&gt; Might we finally get polymock now that we are heading north again?
---
LS5 focuses on Norn and Charr, not Asura.
---
&gt; What about the dungeons that we once tore apart in GW1.
---
Who knows, but from the past wil now we only got one original dungeon from GW1, Sorrow's Embrace. And even there only the story-mode endboss is the same, everything else is completely different.
---
I really hope this becomes common practice for all new releases. I would love to save them all and kinda look back. Really cool, thank you Anet.
---
Don't make hate out to be the same as criticism
---
Druid, Mirage (pve only), Dragonhunter, and possibly Warrior/Berserker.
---
I'd like to improve on Renegade. I'm pretty sure Weaver is a lost cause. I've never tried Firebrand, but I want to.
---
I don't really care about anything else.
---
Of those, Eve Online is what I have the most experience. If you want to be in a roaming gang, participate in fleet fights, or live comfortably in null-sec, then sure, you need a group. But the majority of the game is definitely solo-able. Everything in Empire space can be done without ever speaking to anyone or being in any organized group. It's not that different from Open World in GW2, just with a bit of PvP thrown in.
---
And lube.
---
Apparantly i forgot to mention the Aion numbers :P But it's 12.931mil vs 15.882mil KRW. Korea alone makes about 85% of NCsofts income. They don't make a breakdown of what game it comes from, so it's hard to tell.
---
But GW2 does well enough to not be dropped. Aion is your typical korean MMO that does well there. The graphs look nice, but don't say all too much unfortunately
---
imo, season 2 is only worth it for a few things, if you care about them:
---
- Season 2 episode 6 gives you one black lion chest key on each character's first completion of the episode. 
---
- Getting some story before HoT- it helps begin to introduce you to the Season 1 characters that become so prominent in later stories, and helps connect in getting to the Heart of Maguuma. It's not amazing, though, due to not having Season 1 to connect the personal story to Season 2. 
---
- If you like the luminescent armor, you need the second half of season 2 for a couple pieces (however, it's hard to solo)
---
You're making a lot of assumptions.  Saying we're only getting half the content is purely speculative.  We haven't seen what the "Saga" holds, and S4 had substantially more features/content than S3, so there isn't really a solid precedent as to how much can be produced while an expac and season are being developed at the same time.
---
If they go "all hands on deck" for S5 we will probably get as much content over the next 2 years as we would from something like S3+HoT.
---
People don't wanna believe anet took a hit and are trying to recover. You're just being logical.
---
Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.
---
My theory is that the mechanics they use in these strike mission bosses well be used in a raid at the end of the season (or at some point). Basically, you train with these boss mechanics in strike missions through the saga and then are "prepared" for the same or similar mechanics for the raid. That way they can re-use already built mechanics for raids and cut down on development time. If they have trouble developing raids on a shorter schedule this could be the answer.
---
Thanks; I've always found the Flame Legion fascinating ever since I discovered its insidious ways of persuading charr from other legions to join its ranks and even allowed some non-Flame charr to be promoted into high positions such as the infamous Trybulus Griefblade who planted many moles into the Black Citadel.
---
I used the spoiler tag just in case given that this post contains information regarding Flame Legion's pending alliance with the other legions which isn't immediately apparent in either the Jormag trailer or the promotional cinematic with Bangar, Crecia and Rytlock. While it's likely that many folks interested in The Icebrood Saga would've watched the whole announcement stream which teased this information, the devs did kind of move past the Flame Legion lore stuff in the lore part of the presentation, and I didn't want to alarm either those folks who may not have paid attention to that bit, or to newcomers who were attracted via other sources to the game and to whom this reveal would be spoilery until they exprience it themselves in the prologue. :)
---
I imagine Bangar, who does have some political cunning based on what we know of him, could indeed try to use this all-legion rally as an opportunity to further his ambitions for all charr. I just wonder how much the Flame Legion's oppression of women is dealt with in the prologue or in later events if the Flame Legion's role becomes more prominent as a potential ally, as we do get some harrowing descriptions of what Flame does to its females as revealed by the sad tale of [Salina Scorchstep](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Salina_Scorchstep) who *only* speaks to female charr after Drakin Cinderspire has been defeated (there's some other crucial dialogue from the rest of Kalla's Killers, but Salina's own words are the most haunting, IMHO):
---
&gt; **Player:** It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you. I promise.  
---
&gt; **Salina:** No. No you won't. You can try, but if you start anything with me, I will finish you. I've killed men so quietly and so quickly that their last breath never make it out.  
---
&gt; **Player:** Who are you?  
---
&gt; **Salina:** I had a name before, but I don't remember it. They call me Salina Scorchstep. I heard you've been slitting Flame Legion throats. Did you make them suffer?  
---
&gt; **Player:** How long have you been with this group?  
---
&gt; **Salina:** Ever since they freed me. 163 kills ago. Vesta saved me. I owe her. I'll kill for her. Won't stop until every one in Flame Legion is dead by my hand.  
---
&gt; **Player:** You measure time in kills?  
---
&gt; **Salina:** Flame Legion would blindfold and drug me days on end. Months, years... just gone. Can't remember my name or my age. Now, I mark how many Flame Legion I kill.  
---
&gt; **Player:** Sounds brutal.  
---
&gt; **Salina:** Just returning every kindness the Flame Legion gave me.  
---
Given the hatred of Kalla's Killers towards all male Flame Legion, I wonder if we'll see this Ash Legion warband show up at the summit and how they'll feel about having to deal with Flame presence in the festival.
---
i love how we always get left out of any discussion.
---
A guy posting video on youtube is hardly an authority. But if you like it better, I can make w video telling you how gw1 is not classic version of gw2.
---
The Vital G. raptor and Mirror Masked jackal belong to the same set IMO. 
---
Also, obviously, the Sand skins are just base jackal style applied to other mount types. I don't know how you would indicate that on the jackal square of that set on your chart, but you might want to for the sake of sheer pedantry.
---
I really would love to play GW1 but I just couldn't understand what I was doing. I got to a point where I think I was too weak to progress. I did enjoy it until that point.
---
Sure it does.  GW2 is set in the same areas as GW1, even with the upcoming Grothmar Valley map.
---
Moreover, GW2 originally had a trait/stat point system that came directly from GW1 (more points in a trait line, more increases to skills affected by those stats).  There's no "classic GW2" without re-implementation of that system.  "Fundamentally different" is only in your mind.
---
"UP TO" is critical.  Give true scaling so everyone can be happy from solo player to the person playing with his/her friend to the 5 person group to the 10 person group and everywhere in between.
---
It should be of the same difficulty with true scaling regardless of how many players there are.  It should take about the same amount of time and give about the same level of individual rewards.  So that the only difference is how many friends you want to bring with you.
---
With true scaling, everyone can be happy playing with as many people as they want (up to 10) without being penalized for it.
---
He's good at what he does, and what he does is burn phases!

What if prologue introduces the boss, episode 1 buffs it and in the raid we see the same boss on steorids?
---
"You think you do, but you don't"
---
In all fairness, aren't there quaggans that have nothing to do with the sea that the dragon's in? the ones in bitterfrost frontier, for instance, and other smaller pockets. There are probably plenty of quaggans with no concrete impression of the dragon itself. Hell, I doubt most of the quaggans in the game, if any, have every actually seen it with their own eyes. If anything they've probably been exposed to its minions.
---
They do go a bit more in depth on the breeding farm stuff regarding the backstory of [Salina Scorchstep](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Salina_Scorchstep) who only speaks to female charr. It's a sad backstory which explains her hatred towards all Flame Legion males, and I'd love it if they devs explored this darker aspect of Flame Legion lore and if we can see this story have a somewhat happy ending with the liberation of the enslaved and drugged females, and if anti-Flame groups like Kalla's Killers can learn to tolerate the existence of potential Flame allies fighting alongside them against a greater foe. :)
---
Would be cool. But a pain if they would call that an introduction to raids😂 would like to see a little more difficulty than the winter's day one.
---
Ooo, I missed the jumping puzzle bit. That's exciting. I really miss jumping puzzles. Mounts kind of killed them.
---
Gw2 suffers from the same problem stat sites like  [https://thunderskill.com](https://thunderskill.com/)  does. It's used by people who are above avg interested, and who is probably above the casual limit by a wide margin.
---
Yeah, it's probably connected that the only content we will receive are LW if a third of anet was on other projects.
---
Gw2 trait systems are in no way similar to gw1 attribute points. You just proved you have no clue what a classic release would be, though you are correct in saying trait system (and many others) must be reverted for the cause.
---
The devs that were laid off were working on side projects. Some laidoff devs were working on GW2, but they volunteered instead of the devs from the side projects who went to work in GW2 then. At least that's my understanding of the different articles we got after the layoffs. So technically we've got the same amount (maybe even more) devs working on GW2 than before the layoffs. And if I'm wrong I doubt the number of devs working on GW2 diminished that much because of the layoffs.
---
Nice...more content I won't touch with a 10 foot pole. Please leave the hard mode garbage in fractals and raids were it belongs. I remember LS2 APs. I remember the living hell that was.  I remember thinking I should find a new MMO to play.
---
Then they really must be the best developers in the industry, since the vast majority of things they release does work as intended.
---
Fair enough, then the game really isn't for you then if you feel that strongly about it. But as a fan of FF (having played all but 11, 13 &amp; 15) games myself, I felt right at home and breezed through it. 110+ hours isn't anywhere accurate unless you wasted time reading the dialogue in side quests. That post you linked to even specifically stated 110+hours is from level 1 to Stormblood (2nd expac).
---
Don't worry, your English is fine. :)
---
I'm also curious to find out if the saga episodes end up having as many chapters as the previous seasons had (so about 5-7 bigger story steps per episode) or if the devs have the ambition to expand the length. Personally I'd favor the latter if their budget allows for it as I often felt that the episodes we've gotten over the years were rushed due to a limited number of narrative moments to tackle per episode even if open world and side stories helped lessen the burden of narrative somewhat. I guess we'll have to wait and see. :)
---
How are you raking in the motes? 
---
They were one of the bigger pains for me.
---
uhm it's like globally accepted that rn FF14 is the best MMORPG on aspect of story and end game content tho.
---
Also on term of new content and QoL update releases, both rs3 and osrs are kinda way ahead of gw2.
---
And well every single MMORPG I played easily beats anet on terms on communication and being open with their playerbase, imagine being an MMO and REFUSE to hold a proper weekly Q&amp;A with your players that lasts for 1-2hrs.

You might want to double check that your SSD has the right sata connection. For the longest time I was running an SSD capable of sata 3 speeds on sata 2 (motherboard didn't support sata 3) which definitely slowed things down more than I thought.
---
They just need to stick with a concept. Anyone really. They're all over the place constantly trying new things, but there's a balance with advertisement. You want change, yes, but not as often to where your audience is looking all over the place for info about your product.
---
My guess is the difference will be the Strike missions with Story bosses will put you at the boss directly, skipping everything that could be before (or maybe with a little pre event). Meaning it's a dungeon, but only with the boss and maybe some trash just before. 
---
A fully fledged dungeon would contain more encounters. However story instances are never big enough to even be compared to one dungeon path.
---
For frostgorge ice flow jp: With springer I only need 1 jump (most of the time) to the westish of the chest, the skyscale is even easier from the same place I used the springer.  You get on top and run over and drop onto the chest.
---
Can you elaborate on this? Why is VM worth 7x UM. Sorry still learning stuff as I'm getting back into the game, and I was considering getting these to replace my current glyphs. I have watch Knight and tailor glyphs currently.
---
The Pokemon game release is basically set in stone: it has to be released with the TCG, anime, and other merch. People *want* it to be delayed for improvements (head over to /r/pokemon and take a look at the "venting" tag to see why people are upset),  but it most likely won't be. 
---
GameFreak's response to fan outrage was basically "ok that's nice, but we're not going to change anything." They tried to justify their decisions with technical reasons, but many fans believe GF is outright lying.
---
Is that better than the radio silence we get from Anet? I don't know.
---
Das die dicke Vera da überhaupt hoch gekommen ist.
---
From the [transcript](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Icebrood_Saga_announcement): "Put them in these strike missions and players can play that over and over again, get great rewards for it, right?"
---
Sounds like there might be some "cool skins and stuff" tied to it.
---
&gt; Roughly every two year we get an expansion
---
Bullshit. Heart of Thorns took over 3 years.
---
As someone closely watching the market and gemstore, I can say that Anet was more aggressive with the rotations and discounts last year or two. We used to get "gemstore content drought" periods that lasted for a few weeks at least, where gold to gems rate "recovered", dropped back to where it was before a major sale period. Lately, there was too many overlapping sales, new items and other tempting deals that barely let the exchange rate take a breather. I don't say it's an inherently good or bad thing, but I'm curious on how much lower would the quarterly earnings reports go without this new aggressive strategy.
---
NO.
---
No fuckin dungeons.
---
Drive's me nuts that we are able to dye gliders but not able to dye backpieces.....

This is the best representation. I’d love to hear your analysis. It looks as though LS doesn’t matter to bottom line.

It would be interesting to see Bangar team up with Fume Brighteye, who opposes the Ebonhawke Treaty and hates humans as much as he does, and the two charr schemed together to cause an "accident" which injures Smodur enough that Fume can start a campaign to become a temporary Iron Imperator until Smodur recovers. In so doing Fume would support Bangar's ambitions and become his puppet in the Iron Legion in exchange for Bangar helping to keep her on the Iron throne. I could even see [this memorable scene](https://youtu.be/pwLF9L6V3Ik) with Jenner and Sullivan taking place between the two charr almost word for word from Secret of NIMH by giving either charr Jenner's chilling line regarding Nicodemus's assassination via accident: "No taste for blood, eh? They've taken the animal out of you."
---
I recently stumbled onto ambient dialogue in charr home instance in which cubs point out that Fume is among the three most respected Iron tribunes alongside Bhuer Goreblade and the treaty-supporting Mia Kindleshot, so Fume has quite a bit of sway within Iron Legion if push comes to shove. I for one would like to see more female charr villains after our brief encounter with the dutiful-to-a-fault Emer Whipmane in Vallus Smokemane's story (if we decided to free Vallus rather than duel him as per legion law). :)
---
He just wants to get it over with faster.
---
I run full Viper but with Runes of Tormenting, so I get a small heal for every application of Torment.  With the condi cleanse on Jaunt, it makes it much easier to survive whatever OW throws at you.
---
....was chatting with a dev in game few years back; conversation thread to why they didn't/couldn't use load testing software and dev said too expensive and they didn't have a test environment anyway.

Does 4 man sam count as ticket in ? Just kidding, wish u guys are good at wvw but :/.
---
Gl with guild and enjoy play o/.
---
Well, now you have 3 people saying GW1 can be considered as a GW2 Classic. You even have a prominent person within the community argumenting that since both games share many of the same mechanics, and certainly the lore as we wouldn't be killing dragons in GW2 if asuras hadn't been poking around in GW1.
---
No you can't jump, no you don't play sandboxed instances when you go through a portal. But the fundament is the same, the map the same in general, you have 8 skills you have to pick and be strategic about versus your environment. We *literally* have the same races if we don't count Sylvari. More or less the same enemies, White Mantle being crazy in the jungle, Mursaat in the background, Djinns in the desert.
---
You and I have a very different idea of what a 'Classic' version of a game is. It doesn't have to mean GW2 vanilla with a new engine. A scraped version with less features goes for a classic version, which GW1 can very much be classified as, if you compare the games side by side.
---
TBF casual doesn't mean the same rn as it did 7years when GW2 got released.
---
Back then casual meant for people who didnt want to invest much time and grind for new and better gear, in which gw2 did an amazing job. But now a days we got this kind of elitist casuals who think EVERYTHING should be handed out to them and refuse to accept if any content gets the slight challange added to them. It's a giant part to why gaming magazines are a horrible source to know if a game is good or bad and the reason why anet nerfed HoT and was/is afraid to release decent challenges in gw2 because no matter how toxic Hardcore people can get, it doesn't compare to the bad impact of the toxicity of gaming magazines and toxic elitist casuals, especially when your marketing depends on them :/
---
Looks like Keeya Snowtail
---
Hoping for a cm
---
That was before efficiency pulled from the api. It only crawls the api to update ranking information every 24,12,6 etc hours depending on your support pay rank. This was taken about 15 mins before my rank updated
---
I don't think they dropped this supposed next expac because of the layoffs. There was another, entirely different, reason why they did it. 
---
Things like the 4 LS teams and the recent article about an expac still being "on the table" seem to point to this. If they have 4 teams and it is still a possibility, why did they stop working on it? We were told that LS4 goes straight into LS5, but we all assumed an expac comes after...
---
And you get it every time you talk to an NPC you need for another timegated collection.
---
If what Taimi says is pushed as true, this would be a retcon as hell, because Inquest was building Zone Blue in Crucible of Eternity specifically for housing a specimen of DSD - and even mentioned how large was that thing.
---
What makes you reply to a downvoted comment on GW2 subreddit then, instead of sticking to FF14 or any other of the titles you mentioned?
---
I asked cause I couldn't find anything. I'm assuming you mean criminology texts. I dont have access to mine right now. I assume you're referring to deviant theory when referring to these groups. I suppose that's one way to put it but I dont think most assholes online fall under deviant theory. I also wouldn't put toxic behaviour online under deviant theory unless the person is swatting another person.
---
Toxicity online is pretty normal and since deviance isnt normally arguably it wouldn't apply.
---
Just my two cents.
---
&gt; gw2efficiency is probably a little bit better than any single, or even a small group of guilds. 
---
And that's precisely not the case. gw2efficiency has a subgroup of players, mostly the most dedicated. The game has all players, and guilds gather all players.
---
Call me enthusiastic but it also may be expansion's name, they were saying LS5 would have expansion-like features, so they gave it a name like they would give it to an expac.
---
Ugh here we go with the dragon gender identity memes.
---
Open world PvE sometimes punishes melee-only builds, though; it's good to have both. 
---
Condi soulbeast is simple, fun, and effective. It used to run on swap sigils but with current builds it's fine to just camp shortbow. Just don't show your face in fractal or raid PUGs with that build; you'll be either indulged as a carry or kicked outright.v
---
&gt; I think ANet has plans for the DSD
---
They also had [this thing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:The_Way_Forward_Dragon_concept_art.jpg) show up in the exalted cutscene during Path of Fire, which was attributed to the DSD since the perspective had zoomed into the blue part of the All.
---
They keep dropping bits and pieces that remind us of the ocean, but I don't know what their exact aim is with that.
---
Since this is obviously going to be fixed soon.. what item was it? O_O
---
Looking for Cooking?
---
I see.
---
i wonder how possible it is they scrapped the expac and used it for this newest season. assuming they stopped shortly before the layoffs the timing seems too short (unless you consider the prelude was ep1 and ep2+ is expac but even then that's a bit of a shaky argument)
---
Why 7x? I have the UM ones but I'm not opposed to switching with a good rationale.
---
I still press F5 sometimes on my chrono if that is what you're asking... :(
---
&gt; unless Aurene dies.
---
Can she permanently die though? She already died once, and Joko was known to have died a few times before being literally consumed. So, Aurene permanently dying implies being consumed/eaten by another being.

😅 we'll see. I'm pretty sure I have enough of the remaining supply that it won't matter and I will be able to keep it high. It was mini captain magnus.  I bought these at intervals over the past 3 years. If you check on bltc website you can see where I bought them up.

---
It really intrigued me when they talked about Lovecraftian inspiration for this saga. Because of the few notes we have about the ideas that went into the DSD, Lovecraftian lines up pretty well with it. So either they're hinting that DSD will be involved in this saga (unlikely), or maybe they're just hoping that Lovecraftian atmosphere/designs will be a fitting style going forward.
---
I never understood this mindset.. Dungeons are still there.  Much of the work that went into them was vastly skipped.  They died the moment thier rewards got nerfed.
---
Very few people liked dungeons because they thought they were fun.  They liked them because it was easy gold.  Not that was anything wrong with that.  There are just more effective ways to make that kinda content without more than half of it being ran past and skipped.
---
I've had dreams about this
---
That doesnt make any sense xs
---
You have to start the story to enter the new maps and unlock masteries. If you refer to trading post limitations they will be removed after 5 days.
---
I thought Taimi saying it started with an S was just a joke because we all called him Steve.
---
Cute n funny drawings :3
---
I honestly dont believe GW2 can survive another 2 years without anything big. sucks to say.
---
I know how die in the most creative ways on each class.
---
My bad. Somehow I thought he was saying PoF had less content than HoT.
---
Hmm i see. That's a pretty good argument. Then i wonder what the issue is? I see people blaming ncsoft. Do you think somehow there are internal issues between ncsoft and anet?
---
Sooo, we're getting content presented sandwiched in ads now? That's the new meta?
---
So you've been idle for 5 years, yet the first thing you say is that you love it, that this is the best community and that the trailer for the new Season brought you back and somehow not the entire expansion and season that you missed.
---
Ok white knights, where are you finding these people and just how are you paying them?
---
GW2 at launch was horrible in terms of content. No, the old trait system wasn't any better than what we have now. Specially since they had stats bound to them, meaning you had to slot some points into a traitline even if you didn't want to just because of the plain stats.
---
PvP/WvW wasn't any better aside from the sheer amount of people playing and the fact no one knew shit about what they were doing. 
---
Stop the nostalgia train, just because the game isn't going where we want it to be and living to it's potential doesn't mean it was better before. 
---
And, just in case, it wasn't better before.
---
We have a great community in game. We're all a bit salty here in the subreddit right now though. :) Anyway, welcome back, and enjoy. Living story has gotten much better over time, and there's a lot of good content  you've got to get through.
---
Marauder's gained some favor because it's a lot of survivability for how much damage you lose, but zerker does still win. I think d/d thief or gs/lb ranger would be the most powerful options of what you listed, but you can just jump right in with any one of those builds while working on elite specs.
---
Same rig? Yeah, probably. Or Sloth.
---
The Icebrood Construct looked like it was using the same rig as Kralkatorrik's Torment.
---
elite spec?
---
Can still use it to get mats, and for example legendary tributes
---
This reminds me of better times...
---
There's a Living World magazine now?  Disgusting.
---
I'd rather have them focus on other stuff then that xd eternity is just a nice gimmick

---
Anet lately started to send out e-mails and some people still might click it and see what is coming, and if they are interested, such story happens. 
---
Wasn't this what we wanted Anet to do all the time around?
---
Depends on how you define content. Are you only looking at maps? Because the elite specs alone from PoF are far more content for me personally than ls4
---
Either u got paid to write this or u just someone that tries to be positive in this "dark" time.  
---
If u enjoy this game and the story. Have fun. U will have a lot of stuff to do, but only because a random guy helped u and u enjoy the story doesn't mean u KNOW THIS COMMUNITY. Soooooooo have fun. be hyped if u are, but don't try to be the light here in reddit. #darkmodeon
---
More elitist content great 
---
/s
---
Ncsoft releases there quarterly and publicly comments on them. According to them gw2 has been consistently underperforming. I think they're making cuts to anet and the game to bring the game in line with the profits it's actually making rather than what they expect it to.
---
Haha +1
---
Hahah that’s how it always works out.
---
Hardmode garbage? Leaving hell? I imagine smokescales qualify as raid bosses to you. At least it keeps things interesting...
---
My stance regarding the game is this and I think a lot of people could either agree with it or see it from my perspective.
---
I started GW2 back in 2015 and I think it was better than WoW in terms of look, story and gameplay. I jumped to this game as soon as it launched with my wife. I remember the trailers being amazing and was extremely hopeful that this was "That MMO". You know, the one that does everything right, has no subscription and had the addictive game play. Fast forward to today and I feel like the game has been mismanaged. They have added great things like the Wardrobe and expanding the Crafting Material Storage but at the end of the day, I see the potential this game has and where I would like it to be, but where it is now is upsetting. It could have been the best but it isn't and it's hard to say that and have hope for the future based on what Arenanet has given us.
---
What do you mean fake :(

Playing diviner Renegade in fractals but we do not always get guardians who can maintain a 25 might boon. is alicrity more important or might?

That would NEVER happen, same with random anomalous... Things appearing without any proper explanation, or story hook, sending players to sites like Reddit. Never ever
---
Look at the replies to u/NotAnonymousAtAll’s comment
---
You only need 2 jumps from the spot where a gray triangle crosses a white circle in the west side of the ice floe. From that is a walk to the chest.
---
&gt; Strip the story, and directly face the bosses
---
That would be lovely for w7 as well tbh. We all know raiders go there each week exclusively to RP /s.
---
I mean, from 32 mil to just 2 mil? Sounds to me like you use google's inspect tool to change the numbers. Still commendable to be first, tho.
---
The concept is to take a full dps build as a reference point and adapt it to your liking. Take more defensive traits,take more defensive gear or change runes and sigils. But longbow no matter how you look at it is simply bad for pve and i would never suggest i bad build for the sake of role-playing.Sword/axe is good but he said he wants to be ranged which only leaves shortbow.
---
Deroir said something interesting on his last TeaTime, that the new Thief skills that replaced traps were probably skills from an Elite spec that had to be scraped.
---
Kinda makes sense a bit, those animations and effects were all brand new (at least i don't remember seeing them in the game before).
---
I consider especs as feature. They change how you play content but they are not content itself.
---
Here's my [starting point](https://i.imgur.com/sEDdHNt.png) , time for me to start getting rich again.
---
i know this is a 3 month old comment, but i think more or less what the guy you responded to means is that if they make it easy so everyone can do it, it loses value for him because he feels good about doing something other people struggle with and if he doesn't have that over someone else then it's not worth it.
---
Me and my friends stopped playing when the first expansion came out. I was slightly hyped for the mountsvon the second exp, but never took the step. Now with free HoT expansion and PoF key on sale (3rd party site) I finally got into playing, and man do I love these mounts. It just adds a completely new layer and feel to the world. Also the elite masteries give a totally different playstyle (specially for my ranger)
---
I am still strugling with the overwhelming amount of stuff to do tho.  Would like to get started in raiding but Ill need to gear up first. Having a hard time finding the proper way to get my mesmer and ranger prepped... If anyone has tips I would gladly appreciate it! 
---
Note; (I saved all my old stuff as Im a hoarder, so I have a shitload of all currencies and materials pre-expansion wise)
---
Something something developers in charr onesies.
---
I played gw1 aswell. By your standards I am equally qualified to tell you what to think.
---
Would be nice if you could at least salvage ingredients with the composter. Makes sense that I can compost blueberries, rosemary or slabs of meat.
---
Out of the loop here but why is this relevant to bring up?
---
The floss and rainbow cakes are still there. So are the Grumble Cakes.
---
No. Gear stats are direct descendant of gw1 attribute points.
---
Gw1 cant be gw2 classic because these are two different games. They are not.even the same.genre.
---
Berserker is still the main go to stat for PvE sometimes with Assassin pieces to cap out crit chance. The expansions are worth it for sure, a ton of content and you now only need to buy Path of Fire to get Heart  of Thorns for free. The elite specs added in both expansions are pretty much upgrades to almost every build and change the profession for thief Deadeye can use Dagger/Dagger to focus on stealth backstabs or Daredevil gains access to staff and uses it as a melee weapon with a lot of acrobatic leaps and dodges. Power Ranger is better as a soulbeast where you can merge with your pet and gain bonuses and new skills from them, while [merged](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Beastmode) effects that applied to your pet apply to you instead. Power mesmer is better as Chronomancer where you gain access to wells, different shatters, and a trait that makes phantasms resummon once. I'd suggest taking a look at the [meta builds here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) and see if any interest you. It should also be noted that with the new stat sets introduced into the game condition damage got full DPS sets like Viper that allow it to do high damage on fights that allow for condition ramp up. Power is still meta in open world and fractals but raids are more varied on what is viable and meta.
---
Hey! I hope everything went well!
---
Just a teensy suggestion for next time, give us a little more heads up next time? I am sure they are many of us that saw this a few hours later and weren’t able to lend our support... the community loves taking part in this type of thing when given the chance. 
---
Anyway, good luck, have fun!
---
There is a 'hard mode'; it's called doing the boss with Masterwork level gear. For PoF I had to get a full set of low level gear to make the PoF HP "bosses" any challenge at all. Heck, to make PoF open map running challenging.
---
There isn't a lot of designed difficulty in the game, but there are lots of opportunities to create a challenge.  Anet doesn't do challenging much less actually hard. They nerf content not buff it, with a few exception that are far between like CMs and Migraine. 
---
Well there's always HoT, a shadow of it's challenge at launch but Anet nerfs for casuals and ignores anyone who wants a challenge. 
---
And you know, you use to not have to play the story. GW2 use to be a 'play the way you want', now it's a story game.
---
Eventually being the operative word. We're not even close to there yet. And if they're not making an expansion and they're doing LS then it's likely that eventually is a long time out. Eventually just about every game will die. But we're not at that point yet. We're not close to that point yet. It's like you're trying to make a point because you want to believe the game is dying.
---
It's dying like every single person and game on the planet is dying. We're all a day closer to day every time the sun comes up. Not really  my point.
---
This game, as a stable entity can exist for a very very long time, is in a matter of years, without particularly going up in sales, as long as it doesn't go significantly down in sales. 
---
Again the game isn't slowly decline if we had 3 back to back periods years ago, that are lower than the three most recent periods. This game is basically stable. It's actually gained income since then.
---
Sure eventually this game won't exist any more. What game is that not going to happen to?
---
I couldn't have thought of a more depressing way to make an announcement that to provide doubt about future expansions....are they stupid? People are concerned about the games future and they word it like that?  Anet suicidal?  Where's the passion?
---
you can check some of my other replies or look for the mod of efficiencys reply confirming that this is not fake. here is a screen cap too if every other thing I posted didn't convince you. https://imgur.com/a/ulxevfB . as of now this is outdated btw and my acc value is down to around 2.87 million.
---
Yep, I've seen this point out before. But in other threads, where people have said all the rewards are in the cash shop, when I replied with this same information, I've been downvoted. It's just something people don't think about, because we see gemstore ads weekly, but only get chapters of the living world ever 3-4 months.
---
You are right. Someone should link the furaffinitt ones.

Jormag is referred to by they, a non-binary gender pronoun. Jormag has a female voice actor but is genderless/non-binary and referred to as such in game.
---
As with most things regarding sexual identity and orientation there are people who hate anyone who may be different and they like to make disgusting comments.
---
Borderlands 3 just had a whole mess about this to with Fl4k a robot character being referred to by the they/them pronouns.
---
Came back after 4 or 5 myself, only community I've seen was a be guild recruiting and a be person looking for a guild (hope it was a good match) granted I rolled a new character and I'm in the starting zone...and at least there were a few silent soloers running about...
---
LW2 all over again
---
Add me to that, 100% forgot this game existed.
---
Wrong. These two games are not even the same genre. Classic gw2 would be the vanilla releases without years of pathes and features.
---
And did you just now used popularity as a measure unit for being authority? I mean cool, all I need to do is get 100k subs and a video on youtube to claim that earth is flat.
---
Playing the zones. You can do the two metas, for starters. Then there's the boxes you open which are fairly easy to get to. Taco probably has the route, but I just know where most of them are by now. And there are meteors which the other zones don't have. Plus the daily which are pretty easy to get. Plus the hearts.   I mean 3 of the hearts are piss easy and one isn't.
---
I bought every day in Dragonfall and farmed a full home instance every day as well.
---
By the time I'd finished the reset of the collection, I'd had well over 300 Karkite or and well over 300 mistborn motes.  The ones from Thunderhead peaks and Jahai were my lowest, sitting at around 150.
---
Can you get to one of the Guild Halls, either Guild Hollow or Lost Precipice? If you can you can try entering the AB or VB respectively from there. 
---
That's actually how I first got on the HoT maps. Ran around for almost a month and opened all the WPs and got my Elite before I figured out you had to start the story to get a glider. Still wonder how many thought I was an NPC straight up lvl 80 w/o so much as a mastery bar lulz.
---
yea. Every time Im running around gw2 and I hear the music from the first game, I want to go back and play, but all the people I played with dont do it anymore
---
When I meet someone that looks so much like my character, I'll usually hang around them for a bit taking screenshots.  Wouldn't be surprised if that person was doing the same.
---
Glad to see the comments here are exactly what I do.
---
I log in to get the daily log in chest, maybe do dailies if they don't take a lot of time, log off, wait for something new to drop and go play another game.
---
I’m just disappointed that I’ve never added to this.
---
I mean if y’all have ideas I’d HAVE to write it, like, legally...
---
Now wait for it; there will be a reward item you can get and 90% of the player base will whine they don't have access to it and Anet will nerf 'hard' to 'you have to press more than the 1 key every now and then'.
---
That’s good I must of had bad luck when doing the choya, I thought they were a guaranteed.
---
This is total crap. I have a guild that I still recruit people to from time to time, and this story isn't some crazy far out story you never hear. You just don't realize how many people are coming from other games that don't fit their play style. Not everyone plays with the same play style.
---
I've played most of the MMOs out there, and for one reason or another most of them don't fit my play style. FF XIV didn't. ESO is the closest of all those out there, but I don't like the combat as much as here, and I feel floaty.  Sorta pulls me out of it. I liked TSW also but the combat is also not as good and the fact that the main character isn't voiced makes every quest feel like I'm listening to a monologue. I don't want my character to be mute.
---
This community is pretty good particularly in new zones. You ever ask questions in the Barrens in WoW? lol
---
That shit is funny
---
No =_=
---
DOn't need more junk in the loot table.
---
Yes I did the collection already!
---
They always send emails whenever something big comes up, so that's not an excuse.
---
I simply find it suspicious that this person has been idle 5 years, ignored both a full expansion and an entire season and suddenly arrives NOW singing praises.
---
Thanks for the answers I decided to uninstall GW2, and did that just now. Anyway, Thanks.
---
Seems like she'd need to be struck down and eaten like Joko. Otherwise she jist comes back.
---
Did they really just try to make it look like a boxed expansion, that's some funny spin doctoring there; hey kids we heard you wanted an expansion so here's a free expansion released over 2 years wink wink check out this box art!
---
I'm not.being negative here this is purely tongue and cheek.
---
You shouldn't compost meat. Apart from the smell and the worms, it attracts animals you don't want to dig through your compost pile.
---
It can take a long time depending on what you're asking for and what's going on at the time. Might take a long time now because there are so many free Hots going out and more people might be having issues. But normally customer service has been pretty fast.
---
There have been two times in the games history where they were badly backed up, and it took a while for them to say so, but at at least one of those times there was a sticky on the top of reddit. I've sent tickets over the last three months, all of them were answered in a day.
---
Welcome back :)
---
Fair enough. I still don't see how ls4 has more content than PoF. 2 more open world maps right? But PoF has 3 raid wings to balance that out, those are massive high quality content
---
Hell yeah. This is an awesome move. Let ‘em all know that this community is far from dead :)
---
Can’t wait to raid with you all!
---
A box. For a living world season? Somethings fishy.
---
Try to see if https://wiki-en-dev.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cup_of_Light-Roasted_Coffee  still gives crafting EXP. If it does: it is cheap and you will want to craft that in numbers anyway to turn it into compost.
---
All raid wings came with lw patches, not with expac release. PoF was a story, 4 maps and achievements.
---
Nothing churns a compost heap quote like a foraging bear
---
To be fair, a more figurative definition of "conflagration" is "war", so it could be that too. 
---
Or we could use the more figurative definition of "fire": terminating someone's employment. Primordus is the elder dragon of pulling you into his office and giving you some bad news.
---
Having to cook, and then compost is just extra steps.
---
At the very least I would like that crafting stations were capable of crating the final result directly when you have materials for all the steps, without having to make all the nested recipes.  
---
It could be shown in the UI with brackets. like this:
---
* Omelette Du Fromage (x)[y]
---
 * Where x is the items you can craft with the crafted ingredients materials you actually have, and y with the base materials for all the nested recipes.
---
It's also strange how we can't eat an apple or a banana directly like we can with rice balls. All fruit should at least give -20% condition duration.
---
You mean a financially successful MMO that makes a lot.more money than GW2?  The argument here was that GW2 was dying because of their lack of focus on hardcore content that a small fraction of their player base uses any way and I pointed towards a more successful B2P game that released Raids less often than GW2.
---
I believe I made my point quite well, you can twist you self into a human pretzel for all I care but you can't dodge that bullet unless you're Mister Fantastic from the Fantastic Four.
---
If you're looking for people/guilds/etc, take the portal in your starting city (depends on your race) to Lion's Arch -- that is \*the\* hub of the game.
---
OK I find this bizarre as a PR thing. How many people is this going to reach to actually increase exposure?
---
i would love a balthazar fight as a strike mission, or maybe even a better zaithan fight? a man can dream
---
I agree with your analysis.  Here is my theory based on my 8 years’ experience in software development: 
---
1.	The third expansion was in the works, being developed by a separate project/expansion team.  
---
2.	The project/expansion team were dismissed during the mass layoffs.  The third expansion is then cancelled as a result. 
---
3.	The “half-finished” expansion project is then reassigned to the “BAU Team” to finish.  
---
4.	The “BAU Team" salvage “half-finished” project and deliver it as a slightly bigger Living World update.  
---
5.	The marketing buzz for the “Living World Saga” is just leftover dollars that was originally put aside to market the third expansion.  No extra money is actually spent on marketing.
---

---
It all makes perfect sense if more people were working on side projects than just the 1/3 number that was reported. Otherwise a new expansion would be in the pipeline right now and not "on the table". Anet wanted to move on to new projects, and put GW2 on a lower priority until NCSOFT made them change direction via layoffs.
---
Anyone who is telling you that they are getting 60fps in WvW zergs is lying.
---
You have to lower certain settings to get anywhere near a decent FPS around other people. Namely, character model quality and limit.
---
A lot of people aren't great at seeing FPS, and don't use anything to see what their current FPS is. They will look at their FPS when they come into an area, see it's 70 cause there is no one around them, then say "I get 70 FPS in WvW". No one gets that in a Zerg, no matter what hardware they have. The game just can't do it.
---
Turn character model quality to low, limit to lowest, and then shadows to off-medium, and max everything else out. See if that gets you better FPS. What you are running isn't the best of the best, but it should be capable of getting you around the best you can get out of the game on any hardware. A top of the line i9 is about the only thing that will get you better FPS, but we are seriously talking maybe 5-10.
---
Things like the dx12 proxy help a little, probably more than a new CPU will, but it still has it's limits. The game is just running on an ancient engine that was developed in a time where the mindset was CPUs would be single core and just get faster and faster. Instead, we got more cores, and single core performance stayed about the same. It's heavily dependant on single core performance, and inefficient and poorly optimized. The game just runs like shit I'm afraid. It's frustrating, I can break 100+ FPS maxed out in games like Battlefront 2, but that's just not going to happen in GW2.
---
Insane offer for new players. Actually unbelievable.
---
The stories anet won't tell us.
---
That's basically why I made those two threads.
---
As did I, and still do, which means I am equally qualified to say you're wrong.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing a bunch of rehashed bosses in these, just to up the amount of strikes quickly at launch.
---
If anything it could have been the other way around.
---
ANet's profit listings show spikes up after expansions. One of the reasons NCSoft decided to meddle with ANet's management may have been them announcing S5 instead another expansion. 
---
But we can only speculate, and we may never hear what truly happened. It's even possible that one one person knows what exactly happened since it could have been a result of many different factors coming together individually.
---
Me too, the performance is shocking in terms of trying to blow it up to a readable size.
---
These kinds of posts are posted constantly in the other MMO subreddit I frequent (FFXIV).  Is it really so hard to believe that these posts exist in the GW2 subreddit as well?
---
i'll tell you if you give me your acct first
---
Yes, yes you are. Those rocks that you were able to walk right through, umm, those were hidden inquest holo illusions. Yes, that's right!
---
Maybe they should like..idk...release a ROADMAP and actually tell us what they are thinking
---
My reply may have come off with the wrong tone. I always appreciate threads like these, because stuff like this really helps battle misinformation.
---
Go for the trinkets and weapons first, they make the biggest difference. Armor gives the least value and should be gotten last
---
How is it a good advertisement? Who is going to read it that will pick up the game? Especially given how poor it is to navigate and read.

I gave all my 80 gold to some random in map chat. I am leaving GW2 because Exordium would take me about 150 days, and that’s just insane.
---
Funny joke, but google results list is not what I asked for. So again, until you present proof, there are no facts in this conversation, but opinions only

For some reason I read that title as "CSS is fun"...

2nd viper mirage, but I also run sw/sw power Chrono and swap between the two. Chrono takes down most things much faster, but the mirage shines if I need to solo a champion

No, no, no, no--

RIP ez gold with 10 accounts

If the "flexibility" offered by the saga format can allow for a series of story-light qol patches, having old story fights like caudecus, balthazar, etc get repackaged as strikes in small bundles of 3-4 with unique rewards would do WONDERS for the hardcore community. It'd also be a super asset-efficient way of creating repeatable, accessible endgame content. Barring any unforseen technical difficulties it seems like a no-brainer.
---
*Fixed an issue that allowed ascended herb nodes to be gathered by players who were not instance owners.*
---
So what does this mean in terms of the price of asc food? Will it be worth it at all?
---
Wow, rip the cost
---
Every company doesn't need more money year after year.  It's not true.  Because there are ways to cut costs, virtually always. Saying something is true doesn't make it true. It's true every company wants more money year after year, but Anet does not equal Guild Wars 2, even though right now that's pretty much it's only product. But a company with multiple products doesn't depend on one product. That's the thing. Right now, with Guild Wars 2 being Anet's only profitable product all the pressure is on this. But then, they could launch another product and the launch money from that product would keep the company solvent even if this game wasn't making a zillion dollars a year. 
---
I just don't think you have enough information to make the claims you're making. They're very general and this isn't a general situation. There are a lot of variables we know nothing about. It's possible that everything you say it true. But that's all it is. A possibility. It's also possible the the stuff you don't know completely changes the picture.
---
We have a tiny amount of information with which to draw conclusions. But what we do know is that income between expansions falls down to a stable income. How much profit that is we don't know, so we don't know how sustainable it is.
---
It was good while it lasted.  Thanks to the people who went overboard and made anet patch it out.
---
/r/guildwars2: _____ is good gold!
---
anet: *FIXED AN ISSUE*
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that allowed ascended herb nodes to be gathered by players who were not instance owners.
---
fuckkkk
---
I wouldn’t invest more time. The endgame community just left the game with a big boom (Raiding Tournament), and last Friday we all expected an expansion and they talked 45 Minuten about merchandise and boring story missions. Now new elite specialisations, no new legendaries. I played this game for about 3 month and I uninstalled today. Wasted time.
---
I did not imply that biologie is the only thing to take a look at I did say it's useless to know or try to know which gender a dragon indentifies itself. It's the only thing I took position on and nothing else. So if you say I ever took position on the importance of their psychology than this is untrue.
---
There are two reasons why this a pointless study 1. you can not know this 2. even if you do because it told you, you have learned nothing that yields you any benefit. 
---
You are not going to understand how a dragon is thinking because you know how it identifies itself. It is even preposterous to think they even understand what this human constuct of viewed gender is.  There is no dragon society that pushes them to behave a certain way with a certain gender. Lets assume primordus is  asex it can behave whichever way it likes.  Noone can dictate it how to act. So there is no need for a constucted viewed gender so they can behave differently to the normal role of an asex elder dragon. If they feel like behavior A is correct for how they see themselves then this is correct. 
---
For all we know all those dragons have their own view what they are and how to behave. So what does that tell you? All have a separate viewed gender? Primordus is gender primordus and jormag gender jormag etc.? So why put gender there in the first place it's unnessary cause they are all unique and putting a gender on them makes no sense.  They can't be categorized by human gender role standards. So the only thing that can be done is biogically asign them.
---
Then about aurene:
---
Asking aurene is pointless (A) or poor writing (B). Either we take route A that she can't know since ascending does mean gaining magical power not knowledge so asking her doesn't give you answers. B she knows because ascending means gaining magical power and knowledge. In which case you just ask her how to fix it or communicate with other dragons to come to an agreement. 
---
I know I'm getting downvotes at this point cause reddit but this is just ridicullus and forced political narrative that makes little sense.
---
The game itself isn't region locked but you probably need VPN to buy from Nuuvem if you're from Europe.
---
&gt; dx12 proxy 
---
???
---
Based on a quick google search, 30% of the first $10 million, 25% of the first $10 to $50 million, then 20% after that.
---
It isn't there to hook people to buy the game, it is there to get people interested in the upcoming event and show that they are doing something different for Icebrood Saga. 
---
It is triggering the nostalgia element for older gamers who know what all the gaming magazines used to be like (they died off after the PS2/Xbox/GC era). And likely triggers positive associations with other early promotional pieces like the SAB trailer. 
---
It also works as a "the current state of tyria" primer without being a dry wall of text and if shown to any lapsed player it will get them up to date on the most important elements and themes of the current story quickly. 
---
As for how poor it is to read, well that is an issue with their resolution and weird choice on how to handle fonts, but for the most part it is perfectly legible.
---
I dunno people use barrens as the low point of online communities...but it was just a lot of people chatting and lots of old memes...of rather have that then silence in chat.  Even if chuck Norris jokes got old...
---
Edits to complain about downvotes lol
---
oh my god it's like it's finally like guild wars 1 again
---
This is GW2, we already did a complete pass of that cycle a couple of times.
---
the elder dragon analysis is great
---
I used to ask questions in WOW and get ridiculed, no matter where I want. That happens occasiaonally here, but it's not nearly the same. If you think it is, keep downvoting it's fine. But it won't stop me from speaking my experience.
---
Well that means that if someone wants more ascended herbs will have to buy the garden plots (1000 gems/each) from the gemstore... so pay2win.
---
There are 5 kind of seeds and the free garden plot only has 4 slots.
---
