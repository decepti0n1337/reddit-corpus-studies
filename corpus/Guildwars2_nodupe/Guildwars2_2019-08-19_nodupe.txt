Is it?

Truth be told, they are.

---
It's a medium that requires very little input to experience decent to amazing results. It makes no real sense *not* to invest in something that is fairly close to free advertising. Obviously GW2 will never be like WoW, but even RS3 on twitch does decently, about double/triple the size of GW2 in terms of viewership and just being higher up on the games browse list on twitch is so high value.
---
Nope. I never did it. I only know it works.
---
You are literally the person here making "any humanoid animal" about sex and fetishes. Are you a furry?
---
It's just a game, move on...

Once you’ve used the container, you can’t sell it. You could try contacting support, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up.

I believe the mastery track is required if you want to go the collections route for crafting legendaries. If you are using the collections to craft Bifrost instead of buying the Legend and using the Mystic Forge, then you will need them for each subsequent collection. If you ever plan to craft generation II legendaries, then you will have to as you cannot acquire the precursors without doing the collections. If you’re wondering if you should spend your points elsewhere, maxing out Pact Commander for auto-loot and then Fractals for the singularity are more useful for gameplay. 
---
Mastery point and hero point trains often get posted and advertised on reddit. You can alternatively join a guild at /r/guildrecruitment that could do that for you. If you’re on NA, I run trains for people but I don’t usually organize huge ones, so feel free to PM me if you’d like me to help you get started.
---
I accodently prompted my character to replay a mission we just did. I wasn't paying attention to names. Totally my fault. All caught up now. I appreciate the time you've given me.
---
One last thing, am I able to Complete Living World 3 and 4 side by side (at the same time) with her and I won't have to complete it again on my own? It was a little annoying with Living World 2 and Heart of Thorns campaign. I'd much rather do just one play through with her.
---
Basically yes
---
If you think this is new, you either haven’t been paying attention or are just new to this information - but this spot is pretty well known as an ark farm spot for the dust drops from ghosts.
---
Between the last festival and this one, festival tokens were added to the wallet. An automatic conversion doesn't occur for those in inventory, and for some reason ArenaNet didn't alter the events and adventures to reward the wallet version of the items (as they're two separate items in code).
---
The vendors ask for the wallet item, not the inventory item. So you have to consume them all when you get them.
---
Because he’s okay with it, so everyone else should be too.

i’d gladly pay for a black/white noir mystery episode
---
They should have given her a big rage moment with Mordremoth.  She had a fancy spirit sword, she swore vengeance............and that was it.  Anet really fell short on that one.
---
Lunar new year (money) and Wintersday (activities for easy karma) have to be my two competing favorites.
---
I've said this in some other posts, but games like Gw2 with an expansive world cannot give themselves the luxury on focusing on singular characters as they have been doing, for 2 main reasons:
---
* Lack of resources. Unless they spend all their resources into these characters, their development will never achieve the intended result.
---
* Lack of time. Story would get pretty boring if they had the resources to focus so much in one character. Character development should always serve the story in some way (Caithe for instance, one of my favorite characters, got developed in order to explain Modremoth's secret).
---
We're not playing a story-driven game, we're playing a MMO with a strong story component. We're not playing a novel-type story, we're playing an RPG, where world building is more important than singular characters.
---
Let Anet use their already limited resources to explore actual interesting things in this game instead of developing a character which was already developed .. in fact I believe the destiny 2.0 cast is old and should be replaced. Kas is a nuisance to deal with given her op power, Marjory serves no purpose to the story (only E is somewhat relevant, but god knows when that will get any progress), Canach had its entire story completed. The addition of Gorrick was a really welcoming change in the dynamics of the group (still sucks he is used to progress the story as the new know-it-all but whatever). They should do it more often. You never really grow a bond to these characters as you do in other real story driven games, so there is no point in keeping them around if they don't have anything more to do with the current story.
---
At higher tiers of fractals, people will usually be looking for power DPS ahead of condi.  Guardian is still well suited for that, though, letting you play Healbrand, Quickbrand, or DPS Dragonhunter.
---
CMs are only available on fractal 99 and 100, regardless of dailies.  Only those two fractals have Challenge Motes.
---
In terms of replay-ability I think Halloween is pretty good. Wintersday is also cool because of the variety of events. However I think the event with the most potential but sadly is under utilized is actually the one going on right now, festival of the four winds. If we had decent rewards, Boss Blitz is an incredible fun map to lead, when people listen. The Cliffs on the other hand is one of the best maps to chill. Really cool dialogue to listen to and fun events to detract you from the action oriented arena. And lastly for some achievement hunting, you have the gauntlet. 
---
Sadly the rewards suck so no one cares, but I think this festival we having right now is pretty good in terms of content.
---
As the commander we didn't take her in with us though.
---
&gt; Right now all she does is being a lesbian.
---
I don't recall her ever bringing it up or them focusing on this aspect of her character.  What did I miss that you think that?
---
Anet and lack of marketing, name a more iconic duo.
---
We don't have any good streamers is one reason why.  We need some good personalities.
---
ArenaNet could atleast explain what the "Offensive behavior" was, I honestly don't remember doing anything that I haven't done before... Probably someone salty reported me and I got banned. Meanwhile some guy has been using hacks since 2017 and nothing happens to him. I'm pretty sad :I
---
Thank you too for the answer, I didn't know I could consume them...
---
Did anyone else read this post title as:

&gt;**Noob post: how the hell do I chose a religion?**

?
---
Cuz the answer is the Eternal Alchemy. Clearly.
---
Were you partied with your friends? Because you shouldn't be able to accept, right?
---
yes, a squad can invite someone who is in a group and yes it does indeed invite the whole party and not just the single member which got invited. for that to happen the group does not need to turn into a squad. its just how a squad invite interacts with the system if someone is currently in a group and gets invited.
---
PvP Updates and WvW Alliances. ;-)
---
It's pretty frequently referred to during Season 2 (new relationship with Kasmeer), as well as the last time we see her in Season 3, and when we see her in Path of Fire (relationship issues with Kasmeer).
---
She's more "lesbian" than she is "detective" to be honest.
---
She doesn't shadow Lazarus as a detective would, and it's hard to call her going to Ogden for help as being "detective" rather than her being a member of the Durmand Priory, given that she quite literally leaves all the research to Ogden and the Commander there.
---
Man, I wish I could have the same mindset as you. I just couldn't be hype about all the new stuff. You're reminding me of this one guy who is super hyped about the next upcoming Starwars movie and is moved to tears during his trailer reaction. But yeah... They simply lost me, man... I think the company's and customer's interests just didn't align anymore at some point and I'm too emotionally invested in the product.
---
In general condi DPS takes time to ramp up and gets reset on phases. In fractals high burst power DPS can kill or phase bosses in seconds and skip lots of mechanics. Also there are many bosses that have phases. Out of all the condi DPS though I’d say firebrand is one of the best options since a lot of its damage is still power and it has tome resets when you kill adds. If you can gear a power quick brand though you can swap to DPS DH with no need to swap anything.
---
People do daily CM clears (usually right after daily reset) but most of the better groups want kill proof so it can be hard getting into the them in the first place.
---
How long does it take to get gift of battle, exploration, desert and maguuma respectively? An estimate and/or range of hours would be very appreciated :D
---
"Hey Majoriy, what do you you think of the situation?"
---
"Well my love, I care deeply for you, and your question is very important to me because we are lovers. I believe the situation is dire, but not as dire as our love because we are lovers."
---
Really, the problem with their lesbianism being a focal point of their character is that their lesbianism is not challenged in any way. Their character is not fleshed because their sole trait of being a lesbian is never touched on or attacked in any way, therefore missing an opritunity to draw out their character though dialogue, action or prosecution. This is the problem with token characters with no other redeeming features. It adds nothing to their character just being a certain thing with no substance.
---
I disabled that crap the first time it happened during a jp.
---
Most of these changes are pointless. Longbow needs damage, that's it.
---
That last race was just something else.
---
I've personally made comments in the past memeing the "respects my time" thing. But honestly it's true. Gw2 is not as addictive as other games and it's good. People often don't realise that sometimes these addictive things can take away your focus on what really matters. A video game, doesn't ultimately matter in a persons wellbeing. People have to go out there, get a job, fix their relationships or just keep in touch with friends, not neglecting family, finding a partner with whom you walk the walk of life. If all you do is play a video game, time doesn't care and things will move forward leaving you behind and there will be a moment when you realise all you have left is the game. A game that doesn't matter, that only offers temporary not ao satisfing happyness. And you will hate it. That's why gw2 respects your time. It doesn't try to force itself on you, taking away your focus on what really matters.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/WvW_Reward_Track
---
For maguuma, that depends. If you've done WvW and have heroics, you can use those to get all the HPs (same with desert). Then some POIs and vistas are locked behind metas (Dragon's stand and this little pesky POI in Southwatch AB come to mind).
---
In addition to the aforementioned, desert is gated by elegies which can be farmed, but the amount you get per legendary bounty is RNG. The crystalline ore/ingots are also pretty RNG, but it's not as bad since 2-3 metas is the absolute minimum to get 250 ore.
---
Also, considering that jormag or svanir stuff is likely for next season, we need that norn link.
---
I'd argue Runescape is larger than ESO or GW2.
---
While subreddit subs are nowhere accurate at determining player count, /r/2007scape *does* have almost double our subscribers, and ESO isn't too far ahead of us.
---
&gt;You sort of have a point, but then, why isn't the criticism that she's a bland characters instead of "Hey, look, the only interesting thing about her is that she's a lesbian"
---
This. The problem with her character is that her main focal point, being a lesbian, adds nothing to her or her character development. If her lesbianism had been treated as a less important trait it would have been less ham-handed. If her lesbianism would have been met with more criticism and adversity it would have been a legitimate means of drawing out her character. *And less ham-handed*. It's a pale representation at best: that is my critique. Being a lesbian as a main focalpoint does not work without the character facing struggles based on it.
---
So your argument for reducing the range is that the additional 300 range isn't helpful at all and you can't land it at 1200 range?
---
It makes no sense for DH to be able to shoot all arrows at 1200 range except for one.
---
I just think your changes would make the longbow not only worse but also boring, sorry!
---
Damm your comments history explain a lot
---
ITT: A bunch of semi-afk farmers pissing their pants and trying to justify their pseudo botting for profit.
---
Since you've got answer, are you aware of insane ping you will have?
---
No pvp for you
---
No wvw
---
No raids
---
Problems with fractals too
---
Good idea! 😆
---
being a salty fuck doesnt mean im not right tho :)
---
They were reworked a while back to go their attack immediately after being summoned then turn into clones afterward.
---
Chronomancer has a GM trait that makes phantasms resummon themselves and attack again before turning into clones.
---
They were changed a while back. They now do a bigger^(I think? someone correct me if wrong) attack and then change into clones, but do not count against your limit of 3. In addition, everything that used to be based on number of active illusions (shatters, ether feast, etc) are now just based on number of clones out.
---
Glade you know your self ^^
---
pretty much
---
Good list. Maybe one more: exploring caves and mountaintops is interesting to do yourself, but not very interesting to watch othes do. And GW2 is a heavily exploration-based game.
---
I said lore, you say raid encounter. Nice.
---
Tastes like troll.
---
Countless? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
I want Marjory to become Batman. She got the voice, she got the job, now with Kasmeer being a reinstated noble she has the means, and, adding both together, they got the tragic background.
---
Sweet! Thanks.
---
For largos for instance, which requires two tanks, or soulless horror, if my primary tank is capped out on toughness what gear should I be going for to off-tank?
---
It's an MMO, there are pretty notoriously unfun to watch
---
First of all, i dont want someone who picks up the game for a week then leaves then comes back after a few months or a year etc etc to tell me what the state of the game is. I know better and dont need you to tell me what is what. Dont ask for constructive criticism. Anet dont communicate jack at the moment, they never answer any hard questions they just go silent and that's it. So even if the game isnt dead it feels dead.People expect an expansion or an overhaul at this point or pvp and wvw big releases or actual raids instead of the joke that w7 was or another quality cm fractal, not another bloody LW episode. Even these are getting boring and have zero replayability.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Lastly u say to not trash the game and just leave it be, go do something else and come back. Well guess what, droves of veterans, almost all the high end communities and guilds have left the game and guess what, they're not coming back. When customers leave for other products they leave and that's it. I stopped playing the game 2 weeks ago and the only thing that i will considering coming back for is if they get their shit together and start releasing new content, not merely lw episodes, new content instead of just milking the gem store. 
---
Idc if new players see my post and get discouraged, i dont have any responsibility to them or anyone, i'm not here to hold their hands, i'm not here to do ANET's advertisement for them. If they can't hold on to their existing or potential playerbase that's on them.
---
I think it's mostly to do with the "order of adjectives".
---
Order | relating to | examples
---
:-- | :-- | :--
---
1|opinion|unusual, lovely, beautiful
---
2|size|big, small, tall
---
3|physical quality|thin, rough, untidy
---
4|shape|round, square, rectangular
---
5|age|young, old, youthful
---
6|colour|blue, red, pink
---
7|origin|Dutch, Japanese, Turkish
---
8|material|metal, wood, plastic
---
9|type|general-purpose, four-sided, U-shaped
---
10|purpose|cleaning, hammering, cooking
---
[one source from a dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/about-adjectives-and-adverbs/adjectives-order).
---
So fun I guess would be an opinion (1), followed by a size (2).
---
How would a radius increase solve that? As it stands D Shot misses even when it goes through them because it's a terrain hugging projectile, which has issues with registration. You see the same behavior in other terrain hugging skills like torch 4. It's a well known bug. Even chrono shield 5, which is of the same type, bugs out.
---
And to say that if you dodge F1 you'll get easily kited is really disingenuous. It's like saying we should give D/P thief a lot more burst because if they dodged backstab it's gg. F1 is an extremely powerful tool against kiting foes. If they dodged it, either cause you timed it incorrectly, did not force their dodges, etc, then they outplayed you and should reap the rewards. That's healthy for balance and gameplay. F1 isn't the only tool either. You still have teleports, 800 range leap, LB AA and True Shot as well. Combined this makes DH fairly good versus most kiting specs.
---
"Watch the Ledges"
---
If you don't think the gem store model is exploitative you are either a zoomer who doesn't remember how games used to make a profit or you're one of the biggest corporate bootlickers out there.
---
Thanks!
---
I dunno. She hasn't been that smart or an detective since season 1, to be honest.
---
She pretty much relinquished her role as a leader or second in command quite early in season 2 and never bounced back in my opinion.
---
It's sad to see that, as she was my favorite part of season one and I enjoyed her snark.
---
so much this
---
Not sure what the other comments are about, this looks fantastic!  Nice work!  Hope you two have a lot of fun playing together!
---
How is this related to GW2?
---
Knowledge of the descendant of the king is actually in the Priory's hands. They have an artifact that shows who it is.
---
[removed]
---
Most GW2 players have no intentions to learn the game, letalone watch it.
---
Why, thank you
---
i aint going to lie, underwater holosmith is wicked fun
---
My first legendary was Flameseeker (the shield) and I crafted it for my engi back in 2014 even before it had any kind of arm aura or footprints. My point is, if you really like a legendary from a cosmetic pov just go for it no matter if it's an offhand or not. Today I have almost every legendary so this maby won't be your last one as well.
---
Cool story bro, go tell it someone who wants to talk about wintersday.
---
I'd love some critique if you have any. I'm always looking to improve. 😔
---
'Hey, I really do like playing this fps game because I really like character customization and watching their back 99% of the time.
---
That's you. You're playing an mmo being happy you're not getting what an mmo is supposed to give you.
---
GW2 is much closer to being a singple player rpg than a proper mmo.
---
This game is actually an antithesis of an mmo, it doesn't even want you to farm, DR and stuff.
---
So I wouldn't say it's a 'better one'
---
Actually I'd say it's subpar, it's neither a good mmo nor a good singleplayer game.
---
That moment when I'm playing in 2010-2011 MMO using PC 2010 and get FPS spike from 45-30 to 10-15 EVERY time i use double-boost on my griffon. :\
---
Considering the lvl 78 ones have an infusion slot you can already count them as ascended.
---
I crafted twilight first mainly because of aesthetics and not that I used it much apart from power shatter mesmer. What I should tell you is that when I was crafting it first I kept telling myself I won't do it again.  But after completing it was already working on my next. My next was bolt, which found more use on my chrono.
---
Going for off hand is fine but just think of utility, like how many characters you would use it in. Also, starting with a gen 2 leggy would be a huge gold sink.
---
Also hit space when climbing.  If you do it when both diving and climbing you’ll gather enough speed to get to a slightly higher altitude than you started.  The limit is the height at which you jumped off the ground or solid structure.
---
Foci have a lot of uses on a lot of classes actually
---
I'd say its the most used offhand in raid meta builds atm (DHs, chrono pulls, cweaver)
---
&gt; Then why are you arguing against their decisions they took time and care  to conclude like if it was not good enough for the game? Why are you  acting like their decision with the skyscale wasn't the right one?
---
I'm not arguing that their decision was bad, I'm arguing that a seemingly very large portion of the player base requests it. I have still to request it and as such it is still a matter of opinion, to which I **am** entitled to. Besides, it's not like there is any perfect decision here; things evolve based on a number of factors, the developers don't implement stuff and then say "this is it, take it or leave it" (at least not usually).
---
&gt;All  in the name of a "maybe doing things differently would be fun"? 
---
For the players that request it, it is not "maybe", it is surely. And the idea is not just to do things **differently**, it is do things in a certain other way. The requests are very specific, all focused on infinite flight.
---
&gt; By disagreeing with them, or the final result, and suggesting they go  back to the drawing board, you indirectly invalidate their work, like if  it wasn't "satisfying enough" or "good enough" despite them knowing  better what's good for the game in general.
---
I never suggested to go back to the drawing board, only that they can consider **adjusting** the new mount (infinite flight is technically nothing more than an adjustment). And by disagreeing with them, I am having an opinion, not "invalidating their work", I still prefer an imperfect mount (like now) than no mount at all.
---
&gt; You even implied fixing map problems would be "easy enough" despite not knowing much about map designs.
---
No, I asked what exactly are the difficulties and offered solutions to the few ones presented (or the only one presented, I don't remember).
---
&gt; Why can't you just trust their current design? Why what you think and  prefer is automatically better according to you? What make you think  they didn't try dozens of iterations, indoor, with their own playtest  team? What if what we have is *actually* the better option after all these prototypes?
---
Who said anything about trust? This concept doesn't even have a connection with software, generally, software can (and many times) has to progress to satisfy the need of the market, if the customers are to be kept. Otherwise, customers can very easily go to the competition. And what I think and prefer is not **automatically** better, I don't know where you pulled this from. I said it would be better because it would offer an additional choice and **even suggested it can be tried** for some time and revert it if unfeasible. This is already a compromise hugely in favor of you. The fact that you are unable to accept even a compromise is not a problem on the part of those who want infinite flight.
---
&gt; All of which also force a playstyle (a behavior you ferociously oppose),  or would probably not even be fun enough for people requesting infinite  flight. I told you, there is no winning of this. You speak in the name  of those who request such features but I would bet some in-game gold  that more than half of your solutions would still displease them, or  potentially make the mount unusable.
---
That is because they are **compromise** suggestions, they are to please you, not us, but even this is not enough. So, back to limitless flight without any restriction.
---
&gt; Opinion. There is no pleasing everyone, we both agree with that, and Anet took a stance. It suck it wasn't in your favor.
---
However, both in the current context **and** in the suggested one (in which a choice is given), one group is always unpleased (and it is not the one requesting infinite flight). I think there's a problem with someone there, don't you think?
---
&gt; Being able to master ledges and walls to climb and reach forbidden places
---
And you cannot even do that properly, you cannot climb high walls because your flight bar **still** depletes, which is another complaint about the mount, one brought to attention even **without** suggesting infinite flight.
---
&gt; Nope, but having *expectation* of a studio's behavior vs. player request of a specific niche feature does.
---
Okay so all who requested infinite flight are entitled, so why are you calling even those that do not requests (and just present their opinion) entitled? This is going a bit too far, don't you think? This is an attack based on opinion, which I'm sure you know how ridiculous it is.
---
&gt; That's not what you said though. You suggested that your idea would automatically bring more revenue 
---
No, it is **exactly** what I said: "Of course they have to think this through, ***but they also want to make money***."
---
&gt; You also suggested that flying mounts were big enough to bring new players
---
The same as above, I never said that, I only suggested it **can be** useful for bringing new players, not that they were (automatically) big enough, necessarily, to bring new players : "Maybe they will even consider how many new player this will bring." (sorry for the grammatical error, I don't know how that slipped, it's supposed to be "players").
---
I don't know why you twist my words? That's not very indicative of a good argument, usually. We can stop right here, each with their own opinion, which is better than trying to twist the other's words.
---
&gt; Yes, that's what I was talking about. \[...\] and time for. 
---
That remains to be seen, to be very exact. But statistically, the chances that they **are** numerous (and observed only from posts, let alone any survey), are quite high.
---
 
---
&gt;So either you give sources to back you up with polls and actual statistics or you avoid that altogether lol.
---
Okay, then let's wait for something concrete enough for you.
---
&gt;And  no, telling me to "go look on forums and Internet" doesn't make your  claims more credible. It's also not my job to prove your assumptions.
---
It does, being lazy enough to not evidence right within one's grasp does not necessarily mean the other should need to shove it down the first's throat.
---
&gt; But just for argument sake, I can show you how the VERY FEW threads  we've had about it on this subreddit alone seems mostly in disagreement  with you.
---
That's because it seems that the ones against infinite flight are to noisy to let the others' comments be observable. And just because you linked some answers does not prove anything except opposition exists.
---
&gt; These are the only threads about "flight mount" "infinite flight" "flying mount" we've had on this subreddit since May. And in **all of them**, more than half of the posts oppose infinite flight. So much about "considerable determinent" huh? :P
---
A "considerable determinant" dos not have to be over half. I think if it came to losing a percentage of the player base, ANet would consider even 20% considerable. Also, look deeper for threads, I don't even see the keyword "skyscale" in that.
---
&gt;  DragonFall was also **built** with the current skyscale design, how do you address that?
---
I fail to see how Dragonfall is built specifically around the skyscale's canopy.
---
&gt; The original design was for \[the skyscale\] to move along walls
---
**Original**, but not set in stone.
---
&gt; Again, these aren't necessarily a direct result of players *wanting* something
---
Likewise, in the future, ANet could change their vision and add infinite flight, what will you do then? Advocate how it should be removed?
---
&gt; The skimmer, raptors, jackals, all remained somewhat untouched since PoF
---
I am not sure about that, I may find one update which slightly changed their movement, but I'm not insisting on this because I don't remember when.
---
&gt; We're at the eve of season 5, the new toys will be all they will focus  on now. The skyscale is not only an optional niche end-game LS4 unlock,  but functional enough already. They've moved on.
---
I agree. Just another reason **not** to request any support anymore (or at least not insist on it). But anyone is still entitles to an opinion.
---
Use the LFG tool to create a group for whatever content you’re doing. People are more talkative there.
---
They are farming crafting materials, because these from ascalonian ghost are more valuable than 80c (and if I'm correct, they cost aroung 6s).
---
Afkers in LS4 maps are mostly for Karma. Maybe open world events are too hard for these people? I don't know, but even Snow Crows's member did it (I don't see that player anymore, maybe my daily reports did work).
---
My character was Murag Wraithbane. I was not able to RP since beginning of 2018 due work. :(
---
Hey this is really nice, you shouldn’t worry about what those jerks say ^_^ 
---
Keep it up!
---
Am I the only one who Prefers animated deaths to ragdoll? RG usually looks buggy and glitchy
---
You did it on guard? That's something, because guardian isn't super mobile. At least it has condi cleanses and blocks, because Laudri hits like a truck + you get cripple and weakness.
---
My clones took the agro, so I could focus on orbs. I was pulling all Visions to the light (focus). Stealth works fine there.
---
Those are no bots. If you want to see bots, play FF14.
---
Even bigger piles of clunky weirdness
---
There are only two servers: North America and Europe
---
Wtf is this clickbait shit
---
Please tell me you're memeing
---
Probably a botched emulation of an MMORPG stripped for mobile port. I don’t see how similar the game can be for the specs on a phone
---
Well - who knows. Maybe at some point when the baby will sleep better, I can attend some 5 man instances :-)
---
It’s always annoyed me how they pretty much stripped away her entire character AS the LW progressed. 
---
Hopefully we’ll get a focus on it as they’re having Rox go away for a while.
---
You should have foreseen that this outcome had lots of chances to happen when the image was published.
---
Why Fractles are heavily played and dungeons aren't? aren't they basically - "5 man instance"?

- Bad start overall. Anet double permabanned Kripp in 2012. ("for showing exploit on stream"... using once karma vendor in Ebonhawke)
---
- Anet give no actual support to partners in realm of engagement with audience (no giveaways). 
---
- No twitch drops (they are exceptional for boosting numbers).
---
- No content (you can do the same stuff for 8 hours a day for a limited time before going bonkers).
---
- No communications loop (even WP have no idea when basic stuff like Season 5 lands... maybe autumn, maybe next year? who the fuck knows)
---
- Anet to cool to deal with these toxic Nazis on Twitch, they do not get memes, and overall are from pre-youtube era of communications.
---
Meanwhile the game of same age and same genre (play alone together) with exact same issues (no challenging content, fashion as endgame) - Warframe had 50k viewers on Friday night.
---
GvG is 15vs15 usually. (not 10v10.)
---
I really like the idea of having more diversity in the sPvP maps, but 10v10 could be a bit too many players. For this the maps would have to be pretty big and severall objectives would need to pull them appart otherwise all the gamemodes would potentially end in an "aram".
---
Power DPS is usually better because you also have a great synergy between the burst aspect of those builds and the Defiance Bar mechanics of bosses (the blue bar). If you can get most of your power burst when the boss is broken then you will reach extremely high levels of DPS.
---
Daily recs LFGs usually pop in T4 lfg because either peopel really want to rush them with efficient groups or they just finished the T4s and 1 person left so they're just looking for a last. Recs worth it for more than the pages (which can be useful to start earning for future endeavours) it's because they will all give you 1 [Large Fractal Potion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractal_Potion): if you do all 3 recs you will get 1 of each guaranteed. This is a great way to have potions before getting the [Infinite Omnipotion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infinite_Mist_Omnipotion) (basically infinite use potion combining all 3 effects). Fractal Potions give you super interesting mobility, survival and damage bonuses and are very nice to have for T4s and even more for CMs: they either help you be even faster or help compensate for some mistake/save you sometimes.
---
No it's poorly done and ham handed. 
---
t. Lesbian.
---
Well, I get the impression Ranger is harder to play. I prefer a classes that require me to be active rather than pressing the same button over and over. So maybe Ranger will be the thing I go with...
---
Any build that relies on AI is terrible gamewise for all gamemodes. When such builds perform good it's unfair to builds that require active play and if they perform bad they are useless (e.g. minonmancer).
---
So it's good they got rid of it.
---
Better better in WoW wasn't all about gear.  It required knowing the current meta build, understand gear and stats, learn how to use the meta skills currently and adjust DPS rotation. 
---
You said in GW2 you become better by 'becoming better'. Can you share more details about what you mean by that?
---
I did Liadri in the first year using a special Retaliation-Guardian build, one and only time I really noticed the damage from this boon :D
---
Not terrorists, the amount of people that would probably harm you for insulting their religious prophet, Muhammed, is much greater over there than it is here in America if you say "Jesus isn't real/sucks".
---
&gt; but there are less childish ways to convey that.
---
But then you can't look like a prick and attract attention and make everyone hate you and become a famous prick and attract even more attention.
---
If you have ever played in Guild Wars 2, you can't just read this sentence with your own voice.
---
Before going mobile, GW2 needs properly optimized pc client, you know.
---
But.. Its right there when you open the lfg window. Unless your ui box is tiny you should see it right away. Make it bigger and you'll see everything
---
Having played a great deal of both phantasm styles, I really prefer the current setup to having the passive phantasms. If you really want a shock, go see what they did to the Chronomancer’s shatters...
---
Guardian's hammer "Banish" skill would be my favourite.
---
&gt; Find out next year that the achievements can be re-done for more AP.
---
Am I wrong or that is only correct if you completed the older, pre-re-release festivals?
---
No
---
Obviously i simplified WoW combat but out of personal experience many wow players that i met were looking for this power fantasy where you become someone thats literally unkillable by a level 1 wolf due to stats where in gw2 the game relies on you to be an actual warrior that öearns how to fight and be unkillable that way. In more detail Gw2s combat is more fast paced and based alot on dodging and movement. You can easily kill alot of the toughest enemies in the game if you are good  but as long as you are not they will trash you. But not just this: also the knowledge. Knowomg where chromoe is in WoW becomes obsolete after the next expansion comes and the respective content is now under your level. In gw2 knowledge can always be helpful because level 80 will always be max level. As a better example: nowadays you dont need to know what attacks the deathwing raid boss has because you can just go in on a level 120 and oneshot it. In gw2 the knowledge about opponents moves and combat never becomes obsolete because every enemy in the game always remains a threat that may actually kill you
---
Well, the original reason I wanted to pick Necromancer was because I understand it dominate solo. And I wanted to be able to maybe do some solo dungeons. But reading comments here, I understand that ALL classes are balanced around solo. So while Necromancer doing it the best and easiest - most classes can solo story mode and open-world content.  As I mentioned I heard necromancer is a bit faceroll, and I wanted something more complex to play. Thing is, I played my WoW Hunter so many years, I'm thinking twice about starting with a Ranger. I never played with a Necro. Guess I have to think about it a bit :-)
---
That's a very smart design. Leaving all content relevant at all times. But it also means that once you get to level 80 - what you see is what you get? there's not new abilities and such because you don't level above it?
---
And I happy there's some real-time elements in GW2. I actually prefer that kind of skill over rotation skill.
---
In sPvP I just survive them and wait / hope one team mate come to help. With a quick +1 they usually go down pretty fast, as I can preasure them fairly good on my own, too. (if he not very good I can solo kill, if he very good he may force me away / I have to run for my live)
---
In WvW? Idk I just ignore the 1v1 fights there, because ballance in WvW is not made for it.
---
\-----------
---
What always good against ele is quick high power burst, because it's the class with the lowest base HP and lowest base defense. But if you can't "oneshot" you're in trouble. = better run for your live! It's also never a bad idea to reset a fight against a tank, if you can outrun them. breaking their consistent DPS preasure will make your survival a lot easier.
---
Most simple solution is thus 
---
1: reduce the cast time of the auto to 1/2 second but reduce damage by 10% (net 20ish % increase in damage over time)
---
2: Take the root off of true shot but make it glow more (if your standing around watching pretty colors instead of moving out of the way you deserve it)
---
3: Swap deflecting shot and symbol of energy as well as their CD's around. (Make deflecting shot radius bigger and do something special when it blocks ranged again)
---
Walla bow is fixed, does decent damage and has good utility.
---
I feel this. I managed to get gold on this course this year and threw a mini-party, it is absolutely *awful* on my laptop and makes the keys barely responsive. Seeing it running this smoothly is both very beautiful and makes me want to cry lol.
---
Given how dependent guard is on symbols I would frankly swap symbol of energy and deflecting shot around CD wise then give deflecting shot something else to make it worth using.
---
Mmos are boring to watch, the only time they have people watching them is with new releases of raids and if one guy is really good at pvp.
---
If you see a guy with lots of people watching him is because they watch him/her for him/her, they couldn’t care less for a game.
---
Lots of the bots you see are established accounts. I see it all the time , both killing bots and gathering teleport bots. I suppose after years , these people "assume" the game owes them a free ride.
---
Just off her with Kasmeer, we spent too much time already on B tier romance scenes. Logan can go too. 
---
We have way too many characters, and so many are better than those.
---
Yes, changing your build is copletely free once you unlock it. You cna change stuff even before max level, back and forth 100 times a day if you wish. The only thing is that to have everything unlocked, max level is guaranteed to have enough hero points for everything as you get some from levelup rewards, but you can collect hero points from completing challenges around map to have skills unlocked faster.
---
However, there is also gear, this is not free. Gear has certain stats and some builds go best with different stats. For example power damage is usually best with Berserker's - power (damage), precision (crit chance), ferocity (crit damage), but condition builds don't use crits to deliver the damage, but they rather want condition damage, condition duration and such. Support builds do want usually healing power, boon duration, etc. 
---
So later in game you might want to get multiple gear sets to switch (again, if you want to be fully effective). Don't worry about that at least until you are lvl 80 though.
---
 Gear has multiple rarities that have different reusability. First few tiers you will encounter during leveling, others a bit later, in general it is white (basic) -&gt; blue (fine) -&gt; green (masterwork) -&gt; yellow (rare) -&gt; orange exotic) -&gt; pink (ascended) -&gt; purple (legendary).
---
On level 80, the usual goal is to get full set of exotic gear with correct stats. Those can be got from dungeons, pvp, wvw, can be bought in some lvl80 zones, from trading post, and few more sources. Those are not too expensive so you can usually spare few gold for them (usually you might be buying some more usual stats for like 3-5 days of dailies worth of gold so pretty easy). 
---
Exotic gear is soulbound and thus can be used only on that one character forever. It is perfectly fine to play with exotics. Exotics can't have stats changed.
---
Next step is Ascended, you will need those for climbing Fractals (tiered dungeons) as they have infusion slots that are necessary there. Those can be crafted, looted from fractals (first tier does not need any ascended), can be bought with tokens from pvp, wvw, raids, fractals, living world maps (trinkets), laurel vendor....basically there is so many ways and every content you want to play will help you to gear up. 
---
Ascended has +6% of stats compared to exotics, so it is slightly better than exotic, but not really that much, while the cost is usually like 50x higher. Ascended is max stats you can get, so it is endgame goal, kinda. The advantage of this is that they aren't soulbound, but account bound. So you can switch equip in between characters at will, for example when you want to play something different for a bit and don't want to spend time gearing up first. You can use mystic forge and change stats for ascended gear for minimal cost (compared to craft new one, even of exotic quality).
---
Then there is legendary gear. This one has same stats as ascended. However the main point of legendary gear is that you can switch stats for completely free anytime out of combat, similarly to your skills and traits. You can also switch upgrades in it and retaining the upgrades. It has very big cost compared to ascended, while it offers mainly convenience (no need to have multiple gear sets, and free hand to switch anything for free forever). You can get legendary armor in raids, pvp and wvw, legendary weapons are all crafted, legendary backpacks are from fractals, pvp and wvw, ring is fro raids and trinkets from season 3 and 4 of living world maps. Those can take months to get.
---
-------------------------------------------
---
So yes and no. You can freely change anything at your character like traits and skills for free, but if you want to match your gear to your build, you will need to spend some time and resources to get those certain gears. Over time, this will be easier and easier, as you will get exotic and ascended drops from content you will play, and can store it for new alts and such. Some people have full banks of ascended gear they don't have good use for, some people just do big journey for legendary, some people just play in exotics. It really depends on how hardcore you want to be and how much playtime you will  accumulate. Sometimes it is cheaper to have multiple sets, sometimes it is easier to convert it...
---
PS: in sPvP arena, gear does not matter (you just need to have *something*, even white quality), as all stats and builds are unified there via pvp build editor. So you can be sure that you will be on even ground with even day 1 equip, then all the difference is in skilled gameplay :)
---
If you missed the point of this post by any more, it'd be outside the observable universe.
---
Perhaps this is them trying to get the maps out there, observe data from people playing them in custom arenas to balance them or change things in the future maps such as better choke-points or more vertical sections or avoiding spawn camping situations.  All of this with the goal of eventually adding a 2v2 queue and ATs for 2v2s

Just tell them its pronounce 'Hay-zues Ch-riced'

Don´t forget to submit a bug report.

&gt; That's a huuuuuge potential audience. That's a hype machine waiting to be tapped.
---
If recent events are any indication, that's a *disaster machine* waiting to be tapped.
---
That's why I totally understand why ANet doesn't want to touch that audience with a ten-feet pole. Their game **does not offer what that audience wants**, so if you attract them and they see it doesn't, they cry "cater to US instead" and get you more issues than profit.
---
Solution? Do not advertise to an audience which won't welcome your product. It's the local equivalent of "get woke, go broke".

Is this some kind of an late April fools joke?

Download eg pingplotter and graph the ping to Google.com or so with frequency of just a few seconds. After a few minutes you will be able to see the quality of your connection. Falling R, if it's on your side, would mean that you see high ping spikes there occasionally.

Halloween. It was the first festival that came after release and was one of the main reasons I kept playing it at that time. Just the entire atmosphere and decorations blew my mind. Even now its the only festival I actively play that isn't just doing dailies or achievements.

So you just downvote anything that's not Charr furry porn? Interesting....
---
welcome to the game :)
---
&gt;1-2.
---
You're fine playing GW2 as a "solo" game, that's what I do most days, besides when my guild's online. There's no group content that's required to enjoy the story/game. Most events (even those titled "[group event]") in the world can be done solo or with other people in the area. World bosses and a few certain events (mostly in later areas) need multiple people to complete, of course, but again, you can just get that from people wandering nearby or coming in for the event/boss specifically. Finally, story missions can be done solo or with a party, and scale difficulty depending on how many people are there, much like events do.
---
There are three main kinds of PvE content that usually require a party: raids, dungeons, and fractals. 
---
Raids require a 10-man squad and anywhere from 15 min to 2 hrs, depending on the boss and your group's skill level. They usually tell tangential side stories that can connect to the main story but aren't necessary to understand/enjoy it. 
---
Dungeons are 5-man content that can take from 15 min to an hour. They get unlocked as you level up, but can be played by even max level characters due to the scaling system. The story is parallel to the personal story (the level 1-80 story included in the base game), but isn't needed to understand it. It's basically a story about a group of heroes reconciling and getting the band back together.
---
Fractals are also 5-man content, but take significantly less time then the others, maybe 10-20 min. The Fractals are self-contained pockets of time and possibility, so the stories contained within are either unrelated to anything else, related to other fractal stories, or events that happened in the past.
---
&gt;3.
---
All events take place over a period of at least a week or two, and usually come back the next year or have another way of acquiring their rewards. One of the yearly festivals is ending this Tuesday, but started at least two weeks ago and will be back next year around the same time.
---
&gt;4.
---
Each class has their own class mechanic, and GW2 as a whole has an emphasis on dodging and positioning mechanics. For instance, warriors build up adrenaline through attacking and using skills, which they can then release to fuel a big adrenaline burst attack, while elementalists can switch between four elemental "attunements" at any time, even during battle, that change their weapon skills and traits of certain nonweapon skills, plus rangers have pets that they can command to attack, hold back, or use their special skill.
---
&gt;So without diving to specs yet and such - which class should I start with that will leave an option to explore specific solo builds later on once I get the grip of the basic game?
---
Each class can handle most roles, although some are better at some then others. For instance, while thieves can *technically* be healers, they're much better focusing on dealing lots of damage, being speedy and stealthy, and providing stealth and other utility to their party. Whereas guardians (a sort of paladin-esque class) are much better healers but not very fast or stealthy. But for the most part, roles and which classes are better at which of them don't really come into play until raids and high-tier fractals. Most characters running around in the open world are relatively self-sufficient, and the open world usually isn't very demanding. So long story short, you'll be fine picking any class (and GW2's extremely alt-friendly, so it's not a big deal to decide you want to try a different class. I have one level 80 character for each class).
---
If you want help deciding, warriors, necromancers, guardians, and rangers are all relatively simple to start with and have good survivability. Warriors and necromancers are tied for highest base health, and necros' mechanic lets them go into "death shroud mode," which gives them a second health bar and new skills. Guardians are also beefy and have a class mechanic and other skills that give them passive health regen, and rangers have decent health and have pets to help you, as do necromancers, but their minions come from skills instead of their class mechanic. Personally, my favorite is warrior, as they have access to the most weapons and have a good mix of damage and survivability...and if you get the first expansion, their berserker subclass lets you burn EVERYTHING.
---
Thieves and elementalists are a bit squishier and a little more complex, but are still lots of fun, often as excellent glass cannons that stay alive through dodging, evading, and good positioning.
---
Engineers and mesmers are probably the most complex classes, but are still possible to pick up as a first class if you want to, although mesmers, and to some extent engineers, can take a few levels to really start shining. Revenants are unlocked with any expansion, but I'd put them either here or in the previous category (although they're not glass cannons, just more complex than say, warrior).
---
IIRC, previous staff elementalist raid rotations would require you use Lava font in conjunction with staff fire 3 to reduce after cast delay. Also on FGS, you cast Fiery rush into the FGS meteor shower to reduce the delay of the rush.
---
I know there are plenty but those are off the top of my head
---
75 hours in 2 days, that's pretty impressive.
---
I come here to fucking not have to deal with the overzealous moderation of the forums. 
---
And if he thinks that posting class fixes on the official forums will help, it won't. The only thing they do is let bad PvP players whine other classes into shit.
---
Chrono made Turai a joke. 
---
Mirage was what got me my 8 Lights Liarry though. Jaunt and distort dodges.
---
No... **no**. Please no.
---
They need more stats on wvw merchant. Its useless rn.
---
Cuties:3
---
aight I believe you. Your sentence just comes off as adding to their commentary when you say "and".
---
Isn't that the very definition of "nickel and diming" someone? I understand that people would like to sometimes make small purchases, but it's a very underhand way to get someone to spend a lot more than they usually would. At the moment, anything that costs under 200 gems is relatively easily got through playing the game and saving a bit of gold. It's the same as offers like "buy two, get one free" in stores, it's usually on items you would very rarely buy two of, but your brain makes it seem like you are getting a bargain when you're actually spending twice what you usually would on it.
---
I want a Blood on the Ice-esque murder mystery in the North... Maybe a Kodan Voice or Claw was assassinated and Marjory is on a mission to find out who did it. An inside murder could be turned into a big problem since from our perspective, all Kodan are peaceful, friendly beings who mean no harm to anything. If we throw in a little spite, revolution, vengeance, or bitterness, it could be a real interesting plot idea. (Alternatively they could just throw in some Jormag influence but that's sort of reminiscent of S2 and Aerin).
---
Maybe throughout the story the murderer kills more and more Kodan and the situation becomes more and more pressing. What if they set up a new character that'd seem really cool to have as potential Dragons Watch, and then kill them next episode?
---
It should be set up so players could actually have a tangible theory on what happens next. Make it so its almost a real detective case instead of a carbon copy plot with random out-of-the-blue twists to through everyone off. (Imagine Taimi saying "hah, it was me all along!" That'd be dumb).
---
Maybe we could see her do some necromancy magic and summon spirits of the deceased to interrogate and get clues. The interesting thing with this is that typically speaking, Kodan probably hate necromancy since it messes with the natural balance between life and death, and that'd go against the way of Koda. So, either offend the people you're trying to help, or, skip out on valuable information.
---
Throughout the season I wanna see her get more and more impatient, stressed and moody; almost out of character from the more chill Marjory we already know. I wanna see a stressed out side of her which in turn would make her more interesting but also relatable to the player base. We all get stressed out; whether it's students with their assessments or working folk doing a 9 to 5.
---
m agree with you.   
---
Another precision about it's when i stop gw2 from UI, gw2.exe is not killed immeditately and the ram is not too. i have to wait like 10sec before the process end and the ram free.
---
Love it so much!

It's less survivable and does significantly less damage.
---
N’aaww thanks! I appreciate it
---
idea for mobile game: you continue to take the role of the "commander" but you are actually running your own guild now, game is an adventurer management game, you have to recruit, gear and train adventurers to go out and do missions, clear dungeons, fractals and raids, loot they return with are materials, you can craft new gear or do end game content to get some as drops
---
they can make the cash shop in game based on the consortium so when they do nickle and dim players it fits in lore wise cause they are kinda bad, they can use skins from base game as black lion loot chest drops, with chance to get named npc's and such as rare drops, 
---
tie in events in both games, festival for four wins for instance, can drop ingame loot that if games are tied can cross games, eg items in mobile can unlock skins in main or minis, perhaps guild hall decorations, maybe raids drop something for mobile side
---
That's so nice of you to ask. My art account is at http://instagram.com/cvreeken.art
---
the whole point of fake transaction points is so you dont spend all and the leftover will be wasted forever on your account so you essentially payed more than what the purchased items say
---
the fans of this game are beyond stupid
---
I always enjoy seeing these kinds of pictures. Interesting to use the temple of Abaddon in Orr for the backdrop.
---
Also interesting how the armor went back to your second look for the chest and leggings but different colors. Happened with my main too (charr though, going back to T3 cultural armor after using Trickster then Leystone).
---
&gt;She's more "lesbian" than she is "detective" to be honest.  
---
That's such a silly statement.  Why are you focusing on it so much?  So much so, that even when they do give her something to do (Lazarus, Mai Trin, Durmond Priory, etc),  you can't even give her credit in that regard. For some reason you can only think about her being a lesbian.  It's weird.  I agree that they need to give her more motivation and something juicy such as another investigation.  She's been out of commission as a character for a while.
---
Well, if I want something that has good survivability for soloing, but I want to be challenged with the class mechanism (not just pressing the same button over and over or let your minion/pet do everything for you) which would be good to try?
---
Can you communicate with guilds on the free-to-play version?
---
Not being able to buy magic online currency in as small increments as possible rubs me the wrong way.
---
If I want to buy exactly the amount needed to purchase an in game item, I should be able to. 
---
Being forced to buy X00 amount, when I need X50 is just bad.
---
I don't play much, so I don't have a lot of choices. Anyway, on sylvari I enjoy the "veggie" armours the most.
---
i'm crafting my first legendary too (scepter) mostly for the skin and i'm gonna use it on 2 different characters. tbh it's a huge gold sink and unless you use 5 different stats you should do it because you really like how it looks.
---
Yesn't. Idk how much it works ingame but GW2 is a game that sees external sites like the wiki as part of the game (eg there is a /wiki "itemname" commandingame to immidietly get to the wiki post). similiarly my advise would be to go to the guild wars 2 guildrecruitment subreddit (sorry dont know how to post links on mobile). You can either post there and tell others what you are looking for or respond to a post that another guild made. This is the easiest way to find people of your liking i'd say
---
Plant armor, at least in part, always makes the most sense to me for sylvari. All three of my sylvari are either partial of full plant armor.
---
I guess I'm just a jaded man or people need to start playing serious good story driven games to actually see what a good character is. 
---
So far the only impact a character had on me was Aurene when she supposedly died, and not because it made me cry or anything, but because that opened so many interesting possible points in the story it made me excited for the future :D
---
Just because we have good characters doesn't mean we should keep milking them. As you said, Gorrick and Blish were a nice introduction to the story, but it always felt too impersonal for me, like I was watching a movie and not really take a part on what was going on. Just an opinion however.
---
very true, its part of their predatory marketing
---
I think the thing that makes the left face look weird is the nose. It's broad and kinda flat which makes her not look like a generic white chick. It's not necessarily something bad, just doesn't make it look like most of human females found in game.
---
That's the best way I can put it. It's just different.
---
i think the transaction fees on so small purchases is just too high to make it a viable option for Anet
---
Ehrm, I think you misunderstand me. I'm not saying she doesn't do stuff. 
---
First off, obviously the Mai Trin was her acting a detective, since that's how they introduced her - as a detective. I never negated that, so don't claim I did.
---
Second off, her actions with Lazarus wasn't detective stuff. You simply cannot argue that standing next to someone, who knows you're there, is anything detective like. That's more bodyguard / overseer than detective.
---
Third, with the Durmand Priory, all she did was follow the Commander and listen to Ogden's instructions. Again, she wasn't doing detective work - not on screen, at least. One may claim she doing so was off-screen, but if she did, then she wouldn't have met us with the response of "let's ask Ogden and see what he knows". In detective work, the second thing you do is ask an expert (first thing is gather clues). Instead, that's the first thing she did *after we show up*, and then she just tags along.
---
Fourth, I never said she didn't do anything. I said that ever since Season 2, she hadn't done anything detective-like. She's done plenty - she fought Mordrem on the front lines, she stuck to Lazarus like she was glued to him, kept eyes on Kralkatorrik with Kasmeer, and then helped evacuate towns and villages with Kasmeer. So again, don't claim I did.
---
And lastly, I never that I "can only think about her being a lesbian". I said - to reiterate in a longer form - interactions and dialogue with her are more often emphasizing that she is a lesbian and in a relationship with Kasmeer, than they are about her being a detective or former Ministry Guard.
---
Throughout Season 3 to Season 4, what little screen time she has is mostly devoted to relationship issues or mending with Kasmeer. Even in HoT and Season 2, the time she spent actually acting like an investigator (especially on-screen) is almost entirely limited to the story instance "Fallen Hopes". And that was more cliche'd "investigator puts together clues that are lying in plain sight" rather than true detective work like what she did during Dragon Bash (which was more acting as a director and letting us do the real detective work anyways).
---
Do we really need this kind of posts in the subreddit?
---
Hey, what do you buy each month?
---
Thing is, that's not a valid proposition. Companies sell bundles of gems for two reasons:
---
* Artificially pretending you're getting value out of bulk purchases. The "BEST VALUE!"-tag next to the 2000 gems package, essentially.
---
* Creating an inability for players to purchase exactly as much as they need, "wasting" money in the process. Example is that you can only buy 200, 500, 1000, 2000 gems, but all items cost something like 175, 350, 825, and so on. This is actually being done already in GW2.
---
But a 200 gem package isn't really sensible for (1), and by its very nature of being more fine-grained violates (2).
---
Yea I just always sell my mats, 50g aint too bad.
---
Happy cake day! You sure I can convert the collection weapons?
---
Wow, that's quality content
---
Yes it works
---
Thief does not give them stability that's why. They want to play classes without stability and need you to give them so they aren't stunned or CCed often.
---
yup, never thought about right clicking them to check the options available
---
I like that, "no offense intended", you started with hard haired branch style, and it like turned into tentacles/worm wiggly (I know it is Abaddon Mask) style by the end of 7 years. :P
---
Most cash shops do it. 
---
It's no mistake that the gem/magidollar/gold pricing never quite lines up with the in game purchases.
---
&gt; you cannot climb high walls 
---
FYI #2, you can, with a rotation of boon of vigor, sticking repeatedly on walls and so on. It’s slow, clunky, but possible.
---
Metrics have also proven it climbs higher than the springer.
---
&gt; That's because it seems that the ones against infinite flight are to noisy to let the others' comments be observable. And just because you linked some answers does not prove anything except opposition exists.
---
Lol ok so I give some verifiable threads on here, it’s worthless. I ask you to back up this “20% of silent mass” because it’s not my responsibilies and I’m apparently “lazy”. You’re trying to give weight to your opinion with an invisible mass of players, a typical baseless 
---
argumentum ad numerum. I’m sure there are people interested in infinite flight but I doubt they’re as numbered as what you claim.
---
Either way they were seemingly not important enough since Anet has stuck to their vision.
---
Anyway.
---
This is going nowhere and reached the arguing just for the sake of arguing. I’m exhausted and I have better things to do.
---
Good luck with your agenda, you’ll need it.
---
It's bonkers how people truly believe it has low views because "it's fun to play but hard to watch" for years now.
---
It's absolutely lack of marketing. People don't know the game exist and the casuals who play it don't watch streams.
---
&gt; FYI #2, you can, with a rotation of boon of vigor, sticking repeatedly on walls and so on. It’s slow, clunky, but possible.
---
I meant that flight bar comes into play even with climbing walls.
---
&gt; Lol ok so I give some verifiable threads on here, it’s worthless. I ask  you to back up this “20% of silent mass” because it’s not my  responsibilies and I’m apparently “lazy”. You’re trying to give weight  to your opinion with an invisible mass of players, a typical baseless  argumentum ad numerum.

---
"Verifiable threads" exist for both sides. Did you at least **look into** them before linking them? There are tons of comments supporting infinite flight, but obviously you only see those which match what you want to be true. And still accuse me of "typical baseless  argumentum ad numerum". This is more akin to trolling.
---
&gt; This is going nowhere and reached the arguing just for the sake of arguing. I’m exhausted and I have better things to do.
---
I was going to end it anyway seeing the trolling above. Good luck to you too, Sir/Madam.
---
Yep, them not using that predatory bullshit is why I don't really complain about the current gem system, I can just drop $20 without feeling like I'm losing something, unlike other cash shops.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m70jHwISo64
---
Holy really!
---
you are playing a condi build with not only way too few offensive stats, but also the wrong ones. ofc you're not doing enough damage to kill anything before you run out of active defenses.
---
Weapon's are Viper but I get what you're saying!
---
&gt; So would that be it? I cant put out alot of damage because i'm in Primarily Soldier gear?
---
yes, you're playing a condi build with zero condi stats.
---
that's exactly why you're not putting out damage and therefor constantly dying.
---
Holy Really! Packed! I'll to replicate it once I get around leveling a chronomancer.
---
Weapons vipe is only a small part of your armor set, you have 6 armor parts that also give you stats, as well as 6 backpack+trinkets slots that all almost give as much as a weapon.
---
ArenaNet's marketing practises with gems are cynical as fuck, and while 200 gem packs *almost* work in their cynical favour, they also don't. Let me explain:
---
You can buy nothing with 200 gem packs. Similarly speaking, buying multiple 200 gem packs gives you either more gems than you need by an odd 100 or so, or not enough. Notice how everything on the gemstore costs, typically, an odd number of gems? That means that buying 800 gems is often either 300 or 100 gems *too many*, or is about 200 gems too *few*. 
---
And this is why we'll never see 200 gem packs. Because all of a sudden, you could buy the multitude of 1k items on the gem store using an 800 purchase and 200 purchase: ArenaNet will never allow that. *Every single option of gems* is always, without question *too many or too few* for purchases. This is incredibly cynical and manipulative on the part of ArenaNet because leaving you with leftover gems that either don't buy you anything of value (100/300 gems) or leaving you with excess gems in great numbers that are *too few* to buy many things always means that you're encouraged to buy yet more gems to make extra purchases so those gems don't go to "waste" (especially as the extra gems are too mediocre to often be worth turning into gold.) It's pretty shitty, especially since unlike almost any other freemium economy ever, there's no bonuses for buying in larger bulks of gems, which means that this is *always* the same. As long as the shit they sell is always an even number of gems and is *always* slightly too much or slightly too few over most items in their store, they keep encouraging spending.
---
Example: let's say you buy 1.6k gems because you want a lounge pass somewhere, or an unbreakable tool, now you have 600 left over. What can you get with that? A 500 gem cosmetic which conveniently then *still* leaves you with 100 gems you can't do anything with, *or* it leaves you 100 gems too short of outfits and back/glider combo packages. 
---
And this is why no, they'll never add a 200 gem package. While in principle it seems like it fits in with this model - you can't buy anything with it, so it behaves the same was as the "leftovers" that you normally get left with - it actually removes the incentive to buy more gems than you need in other cases. In the above example, you suddenly don't need to buy the 1.6k gems package, you could buy the 800 and 200 gem package, which not only means you've spent less money but *also* means that you have no leftover gems that then tempt you to spend even more money so that they stop sitting around there.
---
It's nice but hide this from Jawgeous.
---
I appreciate it.  I'll work on getting stuff today. :)
---
Didn't they allow Raid selling? And before that dungeon selling? Seems out of the blue to change that now with no notice.
---
“I would expect some communication from Anet” no tea no shade but how long have you been playing GW2
---
I appreciate it everyone! :)
---
Thank you. I'll go and try and fix it today! I thought thats what it was but I wasnt sure.
---
Your gears are not adapted to your build. For very little effort you could see a major improvement either by swapping your gear to https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Brutus_and_Sheena%27s_armor that you can find on the trading post. Or keeping your gears and changing your build to a power build by example: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Renegade_-_Power_Bombardment
---
If you wish to spend more time min/maxing I'm sure plenty of other people will give you"meta" option
---
Thank you! :)
---
yes
---
how bout you just play a power build, if you only have power stat gear? And also maybe don't just take the meta battle raid build for casual solo PvE, because it's meant to be played in a group where you get every buff in the game.
---
You also chose a fairly hard to play class / elite spec and I can imagine you struggling to play it effectively.
---
Instructions unclear. Even trash mobs volatilize my health pool with autoattacks with minimal or no windup, I didn't see "red" anywhere
---
Most cash shops do, but *also*, most cash shops tend to offer increased amounts of the currency for when you purchase in bulk. ArenaNet is uniquely predatory in that not only do their price points never line up with the purchases you can make, but *also* no amount you spend actually ever gives you *more* than the monetary value to begin with.
---
Most other freemium economies do have wiggle room in that they also try to encourage you to spend larger amounts of money by making larger sales of it an "offer" that give you extras. ArenaNet doesn't do this, while also charging an arm and a leg for what it does sell in the store and always making sure prices never accurately match. This is *also* why, surprise surprise surprise, ArenaNet is unique in that they don't sell *small* packages. Most other freemium games do actually sell these tiny packages that are worth generally very little (though priced somewhat high) because they know the mismatch in their prices means that they can still sell a large bulk pack "on offer" and then encourage further spending in the smaller packages if a player wants to make up the difference. ArenaNet's policy is consistently "Spend big or go home" in their store, with not even a sniff of savings in bulk gem purchases at any point.
---
I barely died in any PoF and LWS4 story, looks like your just lacking mechanically. Or you play a class that does not suit your typical playstyle.
---
ANET is extremely poor or extremely strict when it comes down to "communicating" with the community i.e. they strictly control what information comes out of their HQ. They keep a tight leash when it comes to answering community questions and are mute when it comes to criticism. Pretty much one-way communication from them.
---
Not a fun game to watch imo and Anet themselves don't seem all that interested in trying to grow on Twitch. So makes sense really.
---
I have the same issue, I have tried to reinstall Gw2 / update drivers / switch to previoux arcdps version / remove every useless, without any success. I'll keep you updated if I find something.
---
If I recall, raid sell, dungeon sell, deco sell were exempt because that in that scenario you're looking for content completion and decorations in specific are looking for people to help you do such content. Home instance content is not gated in any manner and to be honest you're a bit of an ass trying to sell home instances. Everyone has access to home instance and could literally just ask in map to share. Almost everyone with home instances who will take people in never ask for money. If the patron is so inclined they will tip on their own.
---
Yeh I did. Did not grab me like GW2 did
---
They also sold the game with "no raids", or "esports pvp" 
---
Look where we are. Lw
---
Pretty sure I have more than that in WoW, however if WoW stays like it is now GW2 will take over ;)   
---
However the first MMO that gets housing right just like Wildstar did ... i might switch to asap! haha.
---
I meant my reply to be for the other guy who was appalled as well! You can trust me I’m a mom!
---
Well yeh, it is not purely gameplay ofcourse and what I noticed is that you don't get disconnected fast for AFK-ing
---
I agree that, to some degree, it could be seen as "less" predatory because it doesn't create an artificial "best package" scenario - and I mentioned this in my post after a bit of an edit, so if you didn't see that I understand.
---
That said, I'm not going to congratulate them for it, either. I refuse to give them some pat on the back "Well done, you didn't do this" because their entire cash shop is cynically designed and, especially since Path of Fire especially, has been relentless pushed and marketed. Chairs! More outfits than ever! Mount skins *exclusively*! The game had it's fair share of doozies during both Core Tyra and Heart of Thorns, but the game also felt more rewarding to play back then. Armour set collections didn't feel like they were put behind cynical timegates or paywalls (which hey, conveniently, encourage the impulsive buyer to just spend gems and get that gold real quick) and rewards that you could earn in game felt justifiably relative to the length of time that you've played. But Path of Fire and every living season since stripped away a *good* amount of that, creating arbitrary timegates (that you could conveniently also skip or lessen if you had the gold to purchase the items from other players, *hm*) in these collections or making new armour sets hidden entirely behind RNG drops that they even later had to go patch to make them *less* rare than they were, etc.
---
I won't disagree that, to some small degree, it probably is less predatory to not have a "best package" mentality in their store. But I refuse to pat ArenaNet on the back for "Well done, you're *slightly* less of a piece of shit, you're a *slightly* polished turd" when ultimately this cash shop could be run in a *genuinely* fair way. And I get it, fair isn't how companies make money, but the more that ArenaNet have sucked content out of GW2 while constantly shovelling more shit into their gemstore and, also noticeably, shovelling increasingly exclusive shit into their Black Lion Lootboxes that is completely untradeable, the less I care for how predatory their practises *still* are. Less predatory, perhaps, but still arguably predatory and *increasingly* so since PoF the more they pushed the gem store and items on it.
---
I am not in a rush, just had a couple of free days. Now work started again so will be a bit more easy going in eating the content (which is a good thing)
---
How do you know Mr. Pessimist? You are not me + you don't know me. I happen to like most game others dislike vice versa. My joy does not come from your approval.
---
That's interesting, because selling raids/fractals/dungeons is literally the same thing, but it was clearly said that this is okay, because you "looking for people for your group".
---
Thank you!
---
The wiki has the various acquisition methods.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_weapon
---
Just depends what you want to spend your time doing. Their are a number of collections that give weapons.
---
thats for rightful ruler of kryta, it shows queen jennah now. if she died it would show 1 person at a time. Order of Whispers knows of someone in particular already
---
Faren would make an excellent gentleman detective.
---
Why would I go in my home instance and wait for people to join if I already farmed the instance before?
---
Because it is a service you can offer to other people
---
You can change the stats of any ascended weapon/armor piece regardless of its aquisition. 
---
The only things you cannot stat swap are trinkets (backpiece, accessories, rings, amulet).
---
You really aren't wrong. Not only are "old guards" of gaming brow-beaten into the current landscape of freemium economies (among other notoriously predatory practises currently happening in the industry) but the newer generation of players have never known games without them. And so now we have reached a point where people will defend a company's shitty and predatory practises (there's even an example of that in a reply to one of my earlier comments, the best kind of irony) because "well at least it isn't *that* bad, right?"
---
It's so terribly depressing. The same tired old arguments always get thrown out in the same terrible excuse of a defence. "But you can buy gems with gold!" "But it's just cosmetic!" "It's *optional* you don't need it!" All of these responses never look at the heart of the problem of a predatory cash shop and just blow it off because people would now rather accept a predatory cash shop that has the *illusion* of being less predatory than it is than actually act like a meaningful change could happen.
---
Also, this isn't directed at you specifically to be clear, but this is a general statement to any would-be defenders: if the cash shops don't seem predatory to you or don't get you spending money, it just means the predatory practises they use *aren't aimed at you*. Congratulations, you're not their target audience. It doesn't mean these practises aren't predatory.
---
Time for you to go and update the wiki then
---
of course it wont, i've been posting necro suggestions on the forums for years. experience taught me the class subforums (all subforums...) there are just trashcans of unread ideas. the only change happens when you get highly upvoted reddit thread, like recently the holomancer crying got them a bit unnerfed
---
This comment right here. Boosting is fine, selling access to farm instance (be it home instance or cleared raid instance) is not.
---
Damn, I got excited by the title and expected a post like [this one](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/pvp/gf-left-me-coz-of-ladderboard).
---
Grumpy, I know you. Yesterday (or day before) you’ve joined AV guild :) 
---
You’ll most likely continue to enjoy this game for a very long time, especially with how Guild Wars 2 is not penalizing players for creating alts (it is easy to gear up, masteries, skins, achievements are account wide etc.). After you’re done with all the exploration, give fractals, raids, PvP and WvW a try. Some meta events (like the one in Dragon’s Stand) will blow your mind with their scale. This game really does feel different than WoW.
---
Like you said in that time this takes you could do other content and get probably more money
---
Berserker backpiece would be another giant eyesore skull like the helmet 💀
---
We going full skeleton.
---
I stand corrected, seems unlinkely that you faked it this fast.
---
Their official stance on selling raids is still, that [it is allowed](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025699913?flash_digest=a4d02c53c1df5e2aadf8a72932c3ed962ade5383). Just selling entry to  your home instance is not, for some odd reason.
---
Not while semi-afk you can't.
---
Welcome to Tyria! You've got nearly 7 years of content to explore, but you'll find you're always going to come across something new. It truly feels like a living world, even if nothing has changed. Enjoy!
---
Couple is only used for 2.
---
"Few" and "several" are the less specific terms used for a wider range of numbers.
---
Even though asking for a donation is volutary, their intent is that you pay them which is diferent from giving it away for free. 
---
Btw, there also lfgs that ask outright ask for gold though they are less than the former ones.
---
&gt; and to be honest you're a bit of an ass trying to sell home instances. Everyone has access to home instance and could literally just ask in map to share.
---
I mean sure everyone has access to home instances but not everyone has bought all the crappy nodes from the gemstore or gambled on BLC for them.
---
It's a shit ton of effort and gold to get max nodes in your home instances, OP is likely just trying to get some of that money back.
---
I'm surpirsed there is a market for it though but you can't fault OP if there is.
---
It shows that you are not native, but I found it quite easy to understand what you meant.
---
Anyway, it is good that you are trying, because this is the only way to improve. Keep it up and you will become fluent soon :)
---
Don't be an idiot.  Do you complain when you go to the store with a $20 bill and can't get the tab to come to an even $20?  No, you just pocket the rest of the change until you want to make another purchase, and then you take that change and add it to whatever money you have then.  Their model is pretty much how any system works across videos games and real life.
---
Where I don't see ANet as being "predatory" and "nickle and dime" is 1) everything in the shop is optional and 2) you don't need to spend money to acquire any of it if you're willing to invest the time.
---
I use superior rune of renegade for my condi rev build, and for elite/legends I like using Soulcleave and Shiro (Shiro's skill 4 can help you reach very high dmg with a short bow).
---
It can help a lot to apply the right graphics options. Reducing maximum amount of characters shown to minim or very low will improve performance dramatically (at least did for me). Now I have to deal with invisible players / NPCs in big open world events, but tbh... it's just less eye soring "christmas tree + wings - player characters". I don't rly miss that.
---
Hotdogs come in jars of 8 or 10. Hotdog buns come in packs of 6.
---
I just refuse to eat hotdogs.
---
Viper's gear is only available from crafting. You can use Sinister's (Power, prec, condi) or Carrion's (power, vitality, condi) gear, because for Open World content (short encounters, killing trash mobs) you don't need expertise. Without expertise you deal HIGHER damage per tick, but your condis have short duration.
---
With expertise, you deal more damage at all, but less per tick.
---
You can try power bombardier (Kalla/Shiro or Jalis).
---
idk i was doing boss blitz last night and still getting 70fps and my PC is a few years old. d12pxy helps a ton
---
I will tell you why. We are getting lots of post here from people who buy the game , boost their first chracter to 80, dont know shit about the game. And come cry on reddit to say how the game is bad because they cant do anything and keep failing. Yes this is stupid to skip whole game and learning process and then complaining.  
---
  
---
But in your case its not it. You did your leveling normaly. So in your case I would say its game fault for not explaining how gear works. What is condi and what is power. You are free to go, you are not guilty.
---
Yeah gotta click on the album link its not just a single picture XD

&gt; LFM dps or bs or chrono or healer to form a semi-static (1 time) lowman (2 players) group to tackle the challenges of Economy CM. Mostly interested in coming up with efficient and profitable strats to deal with the following bosses: Queen Bee (2 kills), Liquid Aurillium (1 kill), Ember (1 kill). Be exp, 5000 AP.
---
I wasnt complaining.. I asked if it was normal?  I like this game. Clearly, I dont think its a bad game.  The learning curve is real but other than that I have nothing really negative to say about the game.
---
I always felt like it's obvious as there are no, for example, Venomstriker without upgrades on the TP, but edited both wiki pages to clarify this.
---
History books and religious texts tend to suggest this is a thing for humanity xD
---
Daredevil for Turai (its a dodge game until he throws the weapons, 3 endurance bars + shortbow 5 really helps.) Mirage för Liadri, but I think I went power - the hard part is landing all 8 orbs and mesmer blinds and distort helps with that. Focus 4 pull all adds into rift at once, then keep Liadri blinded on top of them while spamthrowing. That SHOULD get you 7 hits. Do the last one however you want and set some phantasms on her + greatsword ranged attacks. That worked. :D )
---
While you could argue you can use couple for more than 2 in very niche scenarios,  it doesnt make sense to when few and several are the go-to words to avoid confusion. Few and several are more widely known to be used for a range of numbers.
---
 Plus OP's comment states a definite time of 75 hours and then in the same sentence uses "couple of days". Logically thinking as a reader you would assume they are being specific on both times which is why the question about his use of couple has even come up. If he/she had said few or several, then no one would have said a word.
---
Just because I ask about something I don´t understand does not mean I have a tinfoil, I wanted to know the reason behind an action and then ask more to understand it better.
---
Using this meme as a starting point, I wonder if they'll ever address Rice Balls / Bountiful Maintenance Oil completely outclassing all other types of healing food. Rice Balls give 100 stats AND 10% outgoing healing, whereas Seaweed Salad used to only give 10% outgoing damage and got nerfed in half (I guess you can say the swiftness on kill is the equivalent of the 100 healing power, but lets be real)
---
Bountiful Maintenance Oil on my druid right now gives about 17.5% outgoing healing. That's way stronger than what any other utility slot food will give. Using Lunar Impact as an example skill, and not accounting for any other outgoing heal mods/foods/runes/etc, BMO is giving me effectively ~422 healing power, which is absurd when you take masterful writs as an example of the BiS utility item.
---
:)
---
The screenshot is sarcasm though. He has not in fact made very much money at all.
---
Yes, you do: 1800 \* (1-0.35) = 1170.
---
1800-35%=1170, whats the problem?
---
Nah just new glasses will do. Original price was 1800
---
seems correct to me.
---
1800 * 0.35 = 630
---
1800 - 630 = 1170
---
1800 * 0.65 = 1170
---
Where's the issue?
---
(Done another way, 1800 * 0.35 = 630; 1800 - 630 = 1170)
---
that's 1800, not 1000
---
Hotdogs come in jars?!?
---
&gt;Don't be an idiot. Do you complain when you go to the store with a $20 bill and can't get the tab to come to an even $20? No, you just pocket the rest of the change until 
---
No, this is like going into a shop, but before you get to go in, to buy stuff, they make you purchase $20 worth of "game dollars". And you think "Well, the only thing I'm after is $16" and they say, well, tough luck, buy the $20, then you can hold onto the $4 game dollars. This is **not** how shops work in real life, dude! Unless you're from some weird consumerist dystopia.
---
You probably did not see that the original price is 1800 and not 1000 like the line crossing the price makes it look like
---

---
Is that the Auction House in GW2? Means other people will grind materials and they sell them? Can I get those materials out of the festivals time?
---
Well, I'm happy to hear there's not a single cookie-cutter build per class. Wow had 3 trees per class, but if you wanted to raid - it was clear that you need to use a specific one. And while other were more complex, you rarely used it due to meta.
---
I'd advise you have a good look at the achievements tab, specifically for collections. Many people look at legendary equipment as a long term goal, and outside of weapons they're often tailored to different parts of the game. For example, the backpack Ad Infinitum is heavily linked to fractals, with legendary trinkets linked to different living story chapters. I'm not a huge fan of the legendary weapons since it just feels like a material sink to me.
---
That said, I'd advise tunneling too hard on one goal. I spend my time bouncing between clearing raids, fractals, HoT meta chains, finishing alts and achievement hunting depending on what I'm feeling like doing that day, but it all feels like the time is 'well spent' as well as enjoyable. I just got the precursor set for the legendary armor last week!

All of them are self sufficient to not need any support for leveling. Pick whatever you don't have or what you want to play in end game content later on.

&gt; I have primarily Soldier 
---
This is your biggest problem, if you are wanting to run condi on a rev you will want to get Viper gear all round, if you arent able to get that easily fast, then what I would suggest doing is getting a set of [Devona's Armour](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Devona%27s_armor) off the tp (costs \~10g) and grab some trinkets (if you have laurels to spare, easy berserker ones from laurel vendor), then run a power build with sword/sword until you have all of the viper gear you need for a condi build
---
&gt;Will those also get reset, meaning I can get 25 AP each year?
---
No.
---
&gt; Will those also get reset, meaning I can get 25 AP each year?
---
no, they won't reset, you can continue next year
---
&gt; Will those 2 days stay
---
yes they will stay, next year you can continue from there as well

How do you deal with the pop ins?
---
I tried d12pxy and the moment I loaded in all the textures slowly got loaded, even my raptor was invisible at the start.
---
If you disabled PSO is the RAM usage annoying?
---
Keep in mind, if you stat change a specialization weapon, it will have the regular ascended skin instead of it's own fancy one. So if you want that, you'll need to transmute it back

Support specs aren't really a thing until you hit level 80.
---
Rangers, mesmers and reventants are the only levelling specs that have *any* kind of taunt ability if you want to offer that kind of protection. 
---
Guardians have some decent ally protection in the form of aegis.
---
The video for context :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhDW\_uZZ7-Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhDW_uZZ7-Y)
---
They are five man instances, yes.  Fractals are heavily played because they're still supported, they offer a progression system via a difficulty scale (the same Fractal has multiple difficulty variants, and the higher variants require stronger "infusions" slotted into your gear to resist some ticking damage), and the loot from them as a result is sizably better.
---
The top loot from dungeons is generally tokens, which can be redeemed for max level exotic tier weapons and armour that have unique skins based on the dungeon they're from.  The top loot from Fractals is max level ascended tier weapons, armour and trinkets, the game's highest statistical tier of equipment.  While dungeons provide a decent coin payout as well, Fractals pay out a lot of coin at their higher difficulties, far more than dungeons do.
---
As a new player, you don't have to worry too much.  What we call "Fractals" are pretty similar to what you might call "Dungeons".  At the end of the day, it's a five man instance.  But with the difference between GW2's dungeons and Fractals, Fractals are the end-game five man instances that the players pursue here by and large.
---
So cool! Helps a lot!
---
Seaweed Salad was nerfed not just because of the stat it provided, but because of the awkward gameplay it required. Constantly moving back and forth like a spastic is not a good, nor fun gameplay.
---
Having said that, I agree that a lot of foods currently in the game (especially for healing - as you mentioned) needs alternatives.
---
Woah thank you!

1. Anet doesn't welcome all feedback on their forums, this is well known.

2. Even if they did, your video opens up by calling them assholes.

Yup!

We're always getting random squad invites in wvw and though it's not too much of a bother, it is annoying especially when it happens more than a couple of times. One of us gets an invite, we decline then another of us gets the invite, of course the whole party gets the invite as well, we decline again, and so on. Once i was in a guild party in wvw and received a random invite by a random tag that i've never seen before. We declined multiple times, but he kept on sending us the invite. A couple of us whispered him to let him know we are in a party, stop inviting us, but he completely ignored us and whispered back saying, it's his right to invite whoever he wants. While we couldn't disagree with that, we should also be able to block random invites as you have said.

I still need to beat the special final bossfight to get kingslayer but I think i need better gear

People using official forums in 2019...
---
Just take it as a friendly intervention - they are doing you a favor.  There is little value in the official forums anymore, except perhaps if you're someone who finds watching a movie like Jackass amusing.
---
But I think it's pretty obvious that the tone of the intro is sarcastic and humorous, no? The joke is that most people applauded the fact that they removed that trait, but people who were abusing it are not happy.
---
Is that “still” in the tone of ‘anet’s not dead they’re hiring!’ or ‘anet’s dead because they’ve not got any applications’?
---
1. Have a good single core CPU  and decent GPU
---
2. Turn down: shadows, reflections and player model limit. Turning off nameplate might help as well, I'm not sure.
---
3. Turn on reduced effects, effect LOD.
---
It's actually more than just ANet.
---
Why do you think the mods go after posts? They are not sitting there monitoring every single comment and post.
---
It's the people using the forums. Reddit is no better in that context.
---
The same people that downvote everything that goes against their own opinion or belief (and treating it like a like/dislike function), and report anyone whose words evoke even the  slightest negative feeling within them (regardless of how inoffensive or accurate something is) are the same people that report each other in the official forum.
---
The only difference is that the official forums have more mods than Reddit does. So, they are always readily available to action posts and responses.
---
&gt; Which basicly means everything from buying/selling VIA THE LFG, no matter if you only want to buy decorations for your guildhall, selling raids, or anything else is against the policy.
---
To clarify on this: LFG is not a sales tool. It is a tool to form groups for events, raids, instanced content and so forth. LFG stands for "Looking for Group" - that needs to be the main goal.
---
 If you are forming a group (like a raid), you may adverse it as it as such. You did not offer to sell a raid - you offered to sell goods. The intent of your LFG posting was not to find other players to explore content with, I reviewed that ticket (as well as the warning that was sent to you via email in ticket 7435456). 
---
Please also note that "raid selling" is rife with scamming, and in most cases, the Customer Support team cannot help if a player is being scammed, as we do not officially allow such 'sales'. They are at a player's own risk.
---
I fully understand that this could be a great place for nitpicking, but the rule is really very straight-forward: If you make a group for group content, you are okay. If you use LFG for anything but group content, it is not okay.
---
This is a list of links to comments made by ArenaNet employees in this thread:

&lt;3 it has been a rough week, but I'm super thankful he is still here with me. Thanks for the kind words :)
---
That’s why I said without a reference shot it’s hard to tell why it’s because for all we know it could be accurate to the in game model
---
Selling raids increases the number of people who play that content.  
---
Selling home harvesting reduces the number of people who buy gems to buy home nodes.  
---
IIRC, even offering home nodes for free in map chat is against the rules.
---
All of the above!
---
Ye lets give him views 😂
---
Bind stow weapon and just play around with skills using stow weapon or even weapon swap to cancel skills/animations.
---
It's mostly just muscle memory and getting used to it, I can't give much advice.
---
it takes a certain amount of effort and time to get all of those into your home, eso. since anet still didnt allow us to go into someone else home with him been already inside
---
You can check it out directly on [NCSoft West](https://us.ncsoft.com/en/careers/#bellevue) or the [ArenaNet Careers](https://www.arena.net/en/careers) page. There's actually 16 positions.
---
Start doing fractals and raids. They’re easy and you get a lot of free or really cheap ascended stuff. I have two bank tabs and a mule character full of overflow ascended
---
Opening the video, the first 2 lines of text is you calling ANet assholes.
---
Don't play dumb.
---
so would making a group like:
---
&lt;LFG exploring home instance 1g&gt;
---
be fine? as the 1g is my requirement for forming the group
---
next up: selling heroin to children! god i love an-cap libertarianism in my bideo bames
---
Imagine being this mad about raid sellers
---
No, you're right - a couple is specifically 2 only when referring to humans. In any other context it may refer to 2, but then again it may not.
---
This is why the English are mad.
---
While the intent behind this rule is very clear and well motivated, the distinction between raid selling and home instance selling seems to be somewhat arbitrary/unclear to me. 
---
In both cases, there are no goods sold directly, but a service (clearing a raid for you or access to a special area) which rewards goods (raid loot/achievements or materials).
---
Is fractals rewarding? I haven’t played the game for some time now and I want to get back but I am afraid I’ll get bored and stop playing again. I was playing WoW recently and I got so hyped for mythic+ but it was boring to me, so Im unsubbing from WoW.
---
Don't do this, you'll just get suspended for abusing the report system.
---
So, am I allowed to post on LFG to invite others to a full home instance for free?  That is, not selling or buying (including donations or tips), just to be nice to allow others to come and join with me?
---
 "Hours went into this 18 second clip...(that will be skipped or people will wish they could automatically skip it)"
---
There is no section for home instance though.
---
You can get suspended for selling raid party slots if you post it in *any* other section but raiding.
---
Gear is one thing, gameplay another: in fights, positioning is very important. Dodges should be a last resort, not something you keep using. Try to stay out of the danger zone by running around - keep moving! Use any active defenses you have (blocks, aegis, protection, etc) to aid you.
---
Are you Russian-speaking? It's common in Russian language to use "couple" as a synonym of "several".
---
This might help, armour quite easy and cheap to get :
---

And for accessories I'd recommend LS3, special mention to bitterfrost frontier and bloodstone fen.

---
The Linux position is in regards to the back'end used to run Guild Wars 2 and associated services. Everything about the job description suggests it.
---
Well once Mac is finally done or is it done they may move onto there to get it on all PCs, Mac, Linux.
---
Does that make the many "Buying/Selling tokens" LFG bannable? Or selling/buying instances?
---
In an unrelated thread, I got infracted for saying (I quote): "We already have enough mobility. The game is not made for true flying mounts. Sorry kid. I think your idea is terrible."
---
&gt;It's actually more than just ANet.
---
The same people saying "just play another game" are the people who spend their free time reporting posts on the forums. It must be their endgame, OMEGALUL

---
I don't think this is true. WoW vanilla is mostly about leveling and being ganked or ganking. I don't like to play it but I like to watch it. 
---
GW2 is the opposite because you level up in 1 sec with books.
---
You're insane if you think ANet is going to use their limited resources on porting this game to Linux.
---
I mean, at *least* you can convert leftovers to Gold, or Gold to however much you need.
---
It’s mostly Sylvari cultural armor and the Warbeast Cowl.
---
Are unbreakable tools worth it? I saw a video that suggested it's best to purchase one of the special unbreakable weapons that has a chance to give an extra thing instead of the ones that give nothing and the tools themselves are a little expensive even 50% off.
---
Sweet, double XP events are always welcome.
---
Ele can be pretty fast (I play fresh air so yeah, my build is very fast). Mesmer as others have mentioned, also high paced. Guardian is the direct correlation to a Paladin, but you've already got it good on engi.
---
When selling raids, you are explicitly saying that the buyer is NOT needed "to clear group content".  You are saying that "we can clear this even if you stand in a corner and /laugh, and will do so for a price".
---
jokes on you he is now playing ff14
---
nope, but I'm sure about that.
---
Unbreakable tools are a convenience purchase.  Whether they're "worth it" depends on how inconvenienced you are by having to carry extra tools and swapping them in as the old ones expire.
---
Being able to acquire the glyphs that have special effects is a more tangible benefit, but you can buy those from the Trading Post and apply them to even normal gathering tools.  Again, then you run into that 'convenience' aspect, because if you use the glyphs with regular tools you need to add them back on each time your tools run out (this does not destroy the glyph, thankfully).
---
So if you want the convenience of never needing to replace tools, you can get the unbreakable ones.  If you want the extra things from mining, you can look into Glyphs on the trading post (Volatile ones are probably the most profitable, though it'd be a long time still for it to generate profit beyond the initial cost... the other Glyphs offer various other benefits that might not all be profit-related, like AoE gathering).  You can also wait for unbreakable tools with included Glyphs to go on sale, but they'll be more expensive in gems than the current generic 50% off ones.
---
OMG! Thank you :3
---
only hardware which matters is single core performance on your cpu
---
you dont need to lower image quality that much, reflections and model limit are the only big ones (which you wouldn't even notice most of the time having them lower)
---
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
---
You will lose all upgrades. (runes/infusions)
---
As far as I understand it selling tokens is NOT ok, since its selling a good. Offering/Seeking an instance of the raid on the other hand requires a group to be formed and could fall into the gray area.
---
That said, I don't know their exact stance on these things and therefor might be wrong on those assumptions.
---
God, the irony
---
Tinfoil hat here - september 17 is release of new stuff and those two weeks are for people to catch up towards us who already finished stuff, so people can freely join in new fun.
---
Remember the let's play through season 4 that gradually happened every week just so people could catch up on events before new release? same idea.
---
but home instance is a 5-player group instance, is it not? the OP looked for group to enter 5-player instance and used LFG for that. so if we use your own logic he shouldn't be punished for it. it's very unfair and you do nitpick here - let's not pretend that's not the case
---
[Pot meets Kettle.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9riwqw/after_55k_playing_hours_i_finally_did_it/)
---
plus food/nourishment, boosters and banners new peeps should be done in no time.
---
will use that event to level some alt accounts
---
Having helped some people on forums and also having a returning player come back having not really touched Path of Fire at all, Mastery XP is indeed holding some people back, yes.  Returning players are in a different boat than those of us who've been here the whole time.
---
Ah, I was asking that myself. Fortunately, my gear didn't have any upgrades anyway. But most sigils/infusions/runes are cheap anyway. At least a lot cheaper than crafting a new armor/weapon.
---
I was thinking of maybe making a warrior to taunt enemies or support with banners. 
---
Alternatively, do Engies offer any AoE heal or protection?
---
I can say the same about 2020. And considering Anet pace it could be quite realistic scenario.
---
Lol glad you like it thanks for the reference to stave off my idleness hahahahaha
---
they will never make fundamental changes to their engine, since all of the devs who worked on it and understand it are long gone from anet, to work on better paid jobs
---
I was running this game at 10-15 fps.
---
GPU about 90° degrees.
---
I look up new pcs and they are shit and will be same shit as this pc at running GW2.
---
I decide to clean some dust.
---
FPS are over 70fps without limiter and dropped about 30° degrees on GPU.
---
Lesson: basically just clean your facking dust.
---
No also this could be added in a patch next week and season 5 starts 2 weeks later. As this will likely be automated to end on the 17th without a patch like Festival of the Four Winds will end tomorrow without a patch.
---
PSA: You're wrong.
---
I'm still unlocking them, but it's also not a priority for me. I want to unlock my core Tyria masteries, get my mount masteries, and then maybe return to HoT.
---
This will be a nice way to get the sand portals on my jackal though.
---
xpansion 3 coming better finish expansion xpansion 2 mastery now!!! thats what I am hearing lol.
---
im so confused about visual spectacle. have you guys played ff14? now that is an absolute shitstorm especially alliance raids, ff14 has one of the most flashiest skills and spells and combine all of that by 24 people firing off different spells skills and combined with the boss’s own flashy skills.
---
when you sell raids you dont expect the other player to do anything, he just is in the instance dead. so you dont "look for group" for that person to help you clear/explore group content. same when people were soloing arah paths and selling their party slots so ppl would join and wait for reward. that's literally same as "selling goods".
---
I am simple: see cultural armor, i upvote... i really like to see the progression a char csn make. ( but for real: i can understand that making more cultural armor is way to time consuming ( 5 races -&gt; male / female = 10 + 3 armor types = 30 × 6 armor pieces = 180 single armor pieces to make...), but what they can try to make more are cultural outfits ( we currently have 3 cultural outfits that change depending on wich race / gender wears it cook's outfit, wedding attire outfit and  common clothing outfit) : , it should be less time consuming and it would look good on every character ( hint asura shoes or stretched shirts on norn / charr, also tail clipping through clothes)... i mean it would be: 5 races -&gt; male/ female = 10... it should be way easier to make, also: i am honest with you: my transmutation charge counter reaches zero quiet often when i swap between the cultural armor... i think they should make t1, t2 and t3 cultural armor collections: as sample t1: when you collected every piece t1 armor for every race the collection should give you 3 different  t1 armor outfits( one for every armor type, they change the look to the cultural t1 look of the race that is wearing it)... the pieces are alredy in the game, it should not be that hard... and to be honest: alot of outfits already allow us to look heavy when we are a light or medium armor class and so on... and we also would work to get the outgits before we are able to get them...
---
A 5$ pack would be more reasonable, not too low that they don't make money, but not to high that it feels like a waste.
---
It just become rudimentary system at this point. For every veteran player new mastery is done in one play session after unlock if you go efficient about it.
---
It is not big enough to force "to take care and just play game progressing through mastery" and big enough to annoy that you still do not have it.
---
Well can you blame them? What’s the alternative?
---
People buying boosts = people with less gametime = people with more money.
---
This happens in all games, ANet’s just found a way to capitalize on the huge black market.
---
Solition? Make a matchmade system with the same rewards that’s easier. Will it happen? No cause hardcores will whine endlessly on reddit, so this is what we have.
---
Your character looks really good...
---
they cleary regret making it a grind at HoT. Now basicly you need to have mastery points enough to unlock it while you explore new map or story.
---
You might want to take my word with a grain of salt considering I am core.
---
I play Fresh Air in spvp and I roam with it too. It can kite better, the burst isn't as unreliable (considering condi can always be cleansed and can be unreliable at times), and sc/f is also meta. I guess meta counts the most.
---
maybe I have faulty memory but when I went through it and just played, mastery points is what was hurting me not the lack of exp itself.
---
Still, better to have the event than not. Its not like its hurting anyone lol
---
I love it! Do you post your art somewhere else? I'd like to see more.
---
Somebody has been working out

Personally, Cantha's city maps were my most hated maps in GW universe. All that slums, "I'm attacking to you from a range and you cannot reach me from that tiny bridge" mobs and all that other stuff simply annoyed me. Also enough with humans imo. I would like to explore Norn or Charr culture more. Norn lost lots of their identity and turned into "big humans but not so big" because of things like running speed limitations afaik so it would be great to see more of them and also other legions of Charr.
---
home instance allows 5 people to be inside so by definition it is group content...
---
Guild Wars 2 is, though. MMOs are not and should not be just for folks spending hours on end every day eating away at all their time and energy. Folks can enjoy this game without developing unhealthy gaming habits.
---
the first half was kind of meaningless other than seeing the name of the channel, but it doesn't need that at all until the very end. the second half however was FANTASTIC and if the whole thing had been like that, just leaving the second half the way it is and doing the first half in a similar way, it would have probably been 10/10 for all of it. the second half is 10/10, the first half is 2/10 for the cool boss choices.
---
This is pretty dated info.
---
I have literally never crafted a single piece of Viper's gear and I have over 60 viper's items over two accounts. (Unless you count crafting and then reforging)
---
Expertise is pretty much *always* preferable to condition damage in any game mode, except in cases where you're at or near condition cap (You can't go over +100% condition duration). This is why Viper's is meta over Sinister in almost every case.
---
Some ways to get Viper's easily: [Ascended stat reforging](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing). Season 3/4 map currencies. Specialization Collection weapons (Axe, Sword, Shortbow, dagger, torch are all available Viper's, both exotic and ascended, and the non Viper's ascended ones can be reforged anyway)
---
Probably the easiest way to get exotic Viper's armor is from Bladed weapons available from Itzel vendors for 1g and 500 airship parts now, or free from just doing the meta in Verdant Brink. There's also [episode](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragonscale_Epaulettes_Box) [meta](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Caudecus's_Mask_Box) [achievement](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Houndskin_Mantle_Box) stat choose with Viper's available, which are also obtainable from [sPvP](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Draconis_Mons_Cache). Some elite specialization armor pieces are also available in Viper's (see above list of specialization weapons)
---
There's a [Heart of Thorns story step](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Box_of_Viper's_Gear) that gives you an exotic Viper's item of your choice. 
---
There's probably lots more ways to get Viper's gear easily, especially with the big stat choose patch not long ago, but that's all that comes to mind at present.
---
Dual classes.
---
YES WE ARE!
---
Just the entire crafting station strapped to your back.
---
Congrats, welcome to the club.
---
I could imagine playing through the expansions as a new player these days is a little quiet and difficult(HoT Hero Points, in particular). This is to help new players get caught up. This also makes it seem likely we'll be utilizing old masteries in Season 5, which is good.
---
I'm waiting for the "Catch Up With Everyone Who Already Has A Legendary Weapon" event.
---
I see you do not enjoy Anets new refocus on Guild Wars 2 product? ;-)
---
Personally I was always against the experience part of masteries. I get it's an MMO and we are supposed to grind wolves or spiders to level up, but masteries never made sense as having two separate progression systems - mastery points in addition to experience. The real challenge in HoT masteries was always in getting those last few mastery points, the exp was never hard.
---
The amount of time I spent killing 10 rats in Elona has nothing to do with mastering the use of my springer or jackal or griffon. Exploring the maps, figuring out all the platforming or variety of ways to reach each of the mastery orbs - that's the real mastery of mounts and doesn't need an exp gate at all.
---
Dire or rampager should tide you over until you get viper figured out :)
---
Pretty much all masteries should take a lot longer to get, it was advertised as the replacement of level increases and gear upgrades and now its just something you dont even think about and get done in 20 minutes.
---
this surely won't backfire
---
Should have used your phone to take that picture.
---
I know it came out in 2012, that’s why said it was a 7+ year old game (also because this game would have been in the pipeline 2-3 years before release.)
---
That’s also what I alluded to by saying that there are fidelity options in the game, but even with the best hardware you have to disable them to get even decent frame rates, forget 1440p 144hz.
---
Also as I said in the last updating the engine is a lot of work because they didn’t do proper lifecycle management for their product. A good lifecycle management discipline is to project when said product will need replaced/upgraded before it even comes online. Meaning as soon as you’ve released it, you basically begin working on its replacement. That way it isn’t a massive undertaking or at least the timeline is mitigated.
---
Correct their add one aren’t native dx12 or Vulkan implementations. I never said they were. I said ANet should have seriously considered either of these implementations about 3+ years ago (really closer to 5 considering they would have had early access to those technologies as a big company developer.)
---
EoTN-inspired expansion. 
---
EoTN in GW1 was the dungeons-heavy expansion.
---
We are getting dungeons.
---
POGCHAMP
---
is not selling items used to get the gold to buy/crafting materials to form gear to do said raids?
---
Correct that why I criticized their poor life cycle management of GW2. As you said they WILL never make these changes, but if had managed it properly in the beginning these adoptions could have been in the works 3+ years ago.
---
The absolutely should, and they are making a grave mistake (one of many btw)
---
Just because you are out of touch and clearly projecting some weird insecurity, that doesn't make Twitch any less popular or effective of a platform.
---
First things i saw was "Expansion" in the title and my heart stopped for a second. But as always reality hits and my eyes deciphered more words...
---
ahh may bad, that must only apply to the first few released before anet changed course.
---
Home instance selling costs them money.  I imagine that's the real reason, or at the very least a contributing factor, for the distinction between home instance vs. Raid/Dungeon.
---
Why purchase the nodes when you can pay 1 gold or whatever to use them instead?  I would imagine that for most people this is a better deal because even when you buy them and use them every day it takes forever to recoup the cost.
---
no im just hoping i can come back and edit the comment to say i was an idiot, but when you know that the profits of every single mmo published by ncsoft added up in their entirety STILL doesn't match the profits of the single mobile game ncsoft publishes, i can only imagine anet is going to have so much freedom, especially after the layoffs, ncsoft is watching very closely. if ncsoft (tencent) is the reason gw2 started off with no cantha, the reason heart of thorns had so much cut content, and the reason that season 4 almost didnt happen, then they are not done negatively influencing the outcome of this games future, that much is clear to me.
---
lmao if i wanted to play this game more seriously than the story and for skill id just go play world of warcraft. They removed something fun, fuck em.
---
Ye, that's what I meant.
---
thanks! years and years to get the full set. feelings good
---
It's a great intro, but at this point, I get annoyed by 3 second intros.... and yours is 18seconds.  
---
I cannot tell you how many times i tried to skip 15seconds ahead of an intro just to realize the intro is 4 seconds.
---
At this point, intros are just being viewed as an unnecessary delay for the actual content.
---
HOWEVER, this would be a really cool outro, and I don't think anybody really minds an outro, they're great tbh. An outro can even give the audience a few seconds to better contemplate what they saw in the video. So if I were you, I'd put this at the end. Because when the video starts, the video should start.
---
thanks!
---
damn, well I dont really care for the shatter skills, at all.
---
Berserker's Berserker's Helmet of the Berserker
---
3. I assure you using effect LOD makes the game look better as well. Without it the game with blind your eyes with obnoxious effects.
---
Correct (for this game) but the fact that even have to, to get decent frame rates (forget about trying to get stable 1400p 144hz) seems almost Stockholm syndrome-y. Instead of allowing criticism on decrepit framework that was forgotten about, the first bit of advise to people trying to up their playing experience is to reduce image fidelity/quality.
---
I never even saw this. Anet need big announcements season 5 is make or break for the game. I'm a GWs loyalist and would never want it to die not that it will but if they come out and essentially say season 5 is the same as season 4 but with something like build templates it could hurt GW2 bad. For what its worth I predict each team will get something special for their release what those are I don't know, I think episodes will still be free, the 2-3 month timescale (yes I know they haven't met this in a while but theres a reason I think this), I think there will be 2 maps in episode 1 to open season 5 with a bang with a new map every second episode so episode 2 will be maybe a complete overhaul of an existing map if they can find a way to do this that doesn't hurt the core personal story. I do predict season 1 coming back and thats why we aren't getting an expansion because the expansion team was working on season 1 but this prediction is 2% to 9% likely to happen. Finally Elite specs are highly likely again but not with episode 1 maybe with episode 2 or 3 so they can get some beta testing.
---
hate to break it to you man but you are bad at the game
---
The outfit will surely come to the gem store sooner or later.
---
Cantha Confirmed!
---
&gt; Like the creator really tried to make a super inclusive and unique character that feels a bit random.
---
The two lesbians, the cutesy charr who is a big softy outcast of the warrior race, the black son of the red haired white scandinavian woman and the disabled child genius. "Super inclusive" was the design goal of this new team, they didn't bother to make them relevant characters to the world. Destiny's Edge by comparison are all positioned narratively in important places in the world which gives their presence in the story weight and relevance. A tribune, the captain of the Seraph, a firstborn, a leading asuran genius and one of the most accomplished and legendary norn - all of them bring something to the story just from their positions and accomplishments. That's before you get to know them.
---
their resources are far from limited, just poorly managed
---
Wow that's quick, was this a shorter break than ever?
---
Gonna be at work during the presentation . Already prepared to be disappointed lol
---
ty
---
I totally agree with your point. But how, for example, is getting a mastery point by killing a champion makes me fly my Griffon any better?   
---
So it seems like you have more of an issue with grinding than having to do tasks that directly correlate to master your mastery.
---
When you kill Qadim2 but not VG.
---
Doubt it but if they could it would be nice one episode fractal, one episode dungeon and one episode raid and keep that as its instanced content release schedule. But I doubt the fractals and raids team is big enough for that.
---
Heroes of the storm gave free lootboxes to anyone who watched enough, but the other sites where this will be seen do not have thing kind of feature, so it'll probably be through chat. 
---
If it's 'first come, first served' in chat, it'll be unfair for those with a slower connection or slower machine that can't see the chat as fast, and even if it's random, people will miss out.
---
If they can't have a guaranteed price for watching enough of the stream like those Heroes of the Storm lootboxes, it's better just not to do it if they want to keep everyone happy.
---
When you clear w7 but haven't touched w1.
---
Thanks so much for the in-depth response. I'm still a new F2P player waiting for the expansions to go on sale so inventory management has been a considerable part of my early hours, I guess I'm looking for he best way to take my mind off at least some part of it.
---
Multiple builds do use the same sigils. Prior to legendaries I had 63 bag slots taken up. Now I have 34.
---
If they sell it after it's fine IMO. If it's more limited bullshit that's just a shitty move by ANet.
---
Interesting. But: Voilà
---
PoF masteries don't even really have experience requirements. A while ago I got a PoF account for cheap and jumped into the expansion on a new fresh account, with a 0% map exploration character boosted to level 80. I played the story until about the point where you're supposed to leave the Crystal Oasis, and by that point I had already maxed out my raptor's long jump.
---
The long jump! The one and only raptor mastery that actually is a progression, something to look forward to, something that opens up new areas. At that point I'm about an hour of casual gameplay from the point where I'm supposed to use it to get to the springer farm. From the point where I'm supposed to realize "oh there's this cool place over there, better play some more content so that I can unlock my mastery and get there". But no, I'm already past that and I didn't even try.
---
I really liked launch HoT when finally exp meant something again. It's a shame that feeling of "woah that even rewarded me a lot of experience, awesome!" was limited to half a year in 2012 and another half year in 2015.
---
The content we have all been yearning for
---
Agree. Wish it felt a little bit more satisfying to finally unlock that final mastery tier, instead of it all being something you unlock almost immediately. If masteries don't take effort to unlock, then the system is kind of pointless, and they might as well make most the masteries baseline.
---
the town clothes system will always be superior in every conceivable way. money is the only reason its gone
---
I appreciate the advice!  Thank you!
---
&gt; A mastery should be locked behind actually doing something in favor of this mastery
---
They already tried that with skill points and it was total garbage.
---
lmao i dont know if automagically was a typo but it fits this universe very well
---
I mean the anime vibes put me off, it’s like Monster Hunter World, great game but the whole kitties, handler etc. makes it feel like its designed for kids.
---
I prefer more ”mature” or grounded games.
---
Awesome!  Thank you! I will have to do work in the LS3!
---
maybe in season 30 the 2v2 map will finally make it to queue
---
Hi there,
---
Been years since I used SMS to authenticate. I'm using the Google 2FA app for codes. For some reason I could only input 5 digits on the website using the office computer but it's fine when I got back home to use my home computer. Still not sure what caused the issue.
---
I know, right? I have to work during the announcement... Guess I won't have a chance at the promo...
---
Djinn's map added to ranked ? Interesting. I'm kinda sad this probably mean they won't change the lamp mechanic anymore. It's a fully useless one, and map variety in this game depends quite a bit on those.
---
Oh man, now that you've finally reached peak endgame you can get at achieving the *true peak endgame*: waiting for raid party 😂
---
&gt;Edit: BTW here's   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;the same build using Rabid rather than Viper's  
---
&gt;. It's actually even more condi damage, but less power damage. Also much more Toughness. You can get Rabid on the trading post and it'll work a lot better than Soldier's.
---
Appreciate it so much! Thank you!
---
Yea, people definitely would. Because the amount of "cool" skins on the gem store FAR outnumbers the amount you can get in-game from actually playing. Even legendary armor and backpacks fade into the background.
---
I'm all for anet using the gemstore and the people who buy outfits and stuff are basically paying the game for me and everyone else, which is great, but not when it comes at the cost of the game experience itself. 
---
When everything you'd want to work for is completely outclassed by gemstore skins and most of the new stuff is for the gemstore and when there's literally 0 mount skins to work for and only a handful of glider skins...what's the point? It makes the game feel like a cash shop sim, not an actual game where you play and get cool stuff to show off. 
---
It's also ridiculous to tell people to focus on their career so they can support a game...no player should EVER feel responsible to support a game. If they offer an actual game I enjoy with quality content, then I may feel more inclined to use my money on the game to support it and get things I want, but I sure as hell am not spending my money on the game when they continuously neglect everything I enjoy in it.
---
It's really nice to get communication/news on a Monday!
---
Remember when masteries were supposed to be a post 80 progression system?
---
i wanted to watch but he made me feel like i was losing brain cells trying to be entertained
---
The reason to lvl from 1 to 80 is GW2 put out lots of bosses with cheats for players to test their builds and actions, pro and con, strength and weakness.
---
-
---
This is why players ask Anet for swith/menu/options for different setup for different situation. So players can witch setup on the fly.
---
Catch up??? What's there to catch up anet? Hmmmmmmmmm?
---
This with shiny infusions. What could go wrong?
---
LWS2 is absent because LWS2 isn't tied to an expansion, and this event, as the post says, will only double XP for expansion content.
---
The only achievements that reset are those marked (Annual). Those do not give AP themselves, they only count towards the yearly 50/1000AP achievement.
---
All other achievements are recurring. Meaning they are moved to the historical category the rest of the year, you'll be able to continue getting them next year, and they will return exactly as you left them.
---
Ah okay. Honestly, just pick one and go for it. Unless you're doing raids, fractals and dungeons everyone's really self-sufficient.
---
TriHard 7
---
Real content when?
---
Respect for making a cool character without wings or infusions. The style on the right is my favorite.
---
In my mind events were always about revtalizing parts of the game that need more players. Dungeon even, PvP event, minigame event, WvW event, jumping puzzle event, etc.
---
World boss event would be on the bottom of my list because that's that content that's most "alive" already.
---
Instead of making players discover new things to do, Anet is drawing people away from less popular activities even harder with these events. Completely defeats the purpose for me.
---
We already freed Kryta in GW1, eliminated the white mantle in GW2, and also freed Amnoon in GW2. And there's also the Flame Legion getting defeated.  
---
GW2 has a long history of taking down oppressors. 
---
The trick is making the Chinese government think that your allegory works for them instead against them.
---
Hey, no one can have anything that anyone else can't have, come on now. That'd just be unfair.
---
I see your tinfoil hat and raise you a colander with magnets strapped to it to confuse the radio waves. 
---
I think it will be one of: 
---
* A mobile port. *Don't you guys have phones?* 
---
* Season 5 release info. *I thought you guys wanted more communication?!* 
---
* A "We're skipping Season 5 and it's a paid expansion" announcement (which, whatever, yeah okay)
---
* "New changes to PvP: mounts are now obligatory, mirages can no longer produce clones and fractal instabilities are now in place in all ranked PvP matches, but only the birds one."
---
Actually, I kind of like the option of fractal instabilities in PvP matches (and raids and dungeons). That would be cool.
---
&gt; I see your tinfoil hat and raise you a colander with magnets strapped to it to confuse the radio waves
---
**no string bets, please!**

---
This makes me realise I really don't like the character select screen for PoF
---
Yes but new ones are alot cheaper.
---
Are there unique achievements for gathering in the home instance?
---
I disagree with not allowing the advertisement of home instances, paid or not, but it's just not the same as raid selling.
---
You're absolutely right. It's less of a use and more a misuse. Like using decimate to mean devastate.
---
Sorry, for the rant, I'm a firm prescriptivist.
---
I don't get why they don't just do this like Warframe and just link your twitch and game accounts and track you watching it.
---
Guess that'd work better if they had regular events though. Warframe's biggest pain on that was getting people setup BEFORE the show and not during it
---
Oh why... Your promos, giveaways, aren't good. At least I know it's going to be a mildly terrible time for everyone.
---
As for LS5, I can't wait!
---
"Masteries should be locked behind doing something with the mastery," would be a better phrasing in my opinion.  Some sort of little practice adventure wouldn't be too bad.  For example, you have the beginner, expert and master Gryphon courses which require pretty significant improvements in mount control.  I wouldn't suggest anything nearly this intensive, but I think the adventure system could be used to tie into masteries in fun and creative ways.
---
&gt; which is when you want it to work since the spec is easily tunneled by melee.
---
Did you just say DH loses easily to melee? lol
---
&gt;300 radius covers a point, 180 does not.
---
It's not supposed to cover the point.
---
&gt;Pvp and wvw would benefit from that change, pve would be unaffected since they wouldn't run lb anyways.
---
If we're going off meta, nobody benefits from the change since nobody is going to run it.
---
Buying has no taxes tho, no?
---
And? What does that have to do with it.
---
This is hilarious. Watching his other uploads however makes me think he has some serious problems. Almost all of his video uploads are him straight up not understanding anything while ranting about it. 
---
I watched two videos on WoW that he uploaded back to back. He complained about not being able to access a class hall (for Warlocks) and showed his quest log to be empty, when in the previous video he claimed that he deleted all of the quests that he had because none of them made sense or told him what to do/where to go.
---
Video of him complaining that there is nothing telling him where to go in GW2, when there is a marker on the NPC he has to talk to and there is an objective with an arrow in the top right of his screen: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr6vxsF5lhg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr6vxsF5lhg) 
---
Video of him complaining about pet battles in WoW. He presses Shift + P to open up the pet tab and then rants about the tab showing nothing/no pets when his pets are literally listed in front of him: [https://youtu.be/KNE0MZTUrxk?t=90](https://youtu.be/KNE0MZTUrxk?t=90)
---
I never really got into the story, presentation is alot of it to me, it’s why GW2 is so great, the stort is pretty shallow but it still has me at least somewhat engaged cause the engine and graphics allow for alot of epic moments.
---
It’s a big part of why SWTOR tanked compared to GW2 (they launched at the same time roughly).
---
FFXIV is just very stale and dated to me.
---
Anet needs to do a simple thing to fix most pvp complains.
---
Add other gamemodes (2v2, tdm etc) into off season que with similar rewards
---
Some people don't need gems to finish legendaries.
---
Yes, leveling is great... it’s what to do after that that’s problematic in this game.
---
I'm okay with that.
---
So it's not buying/selling that's the problem?  If it was, that would be so much less vague and easy for everyone to understand.
---
But you are saying it's because LFG is only for group content...but the definition of group content is not clear.  I understand raids, fractals, and dungeons are considered group content.  But what about if someone asks for help to clear their guild hall?  Is that group content?  
---
What about someone posting on LFG to ask for company as they map complete?  Map completion is obviously a solo activity, but grouping makes it more social.  I guess that's how I think of LFG as being social.  Inviting others to enjoy your home instance (for free) is a nice social experience and I've often met new players and even a couple of potential friends through that.
---
What about the case of a new player posting on LFG asking for someone to help them with their class because they find themselves dying all the time doing open world?  That's not group content so I would guess they would get sanctioned for that?  Is that the right thing to do?  It seems wrong to me from an ethical point of view.
---
How about a caring, friendly player posting on LFG to answer questions or anything else someone might need help with (be with just questions, a jumping puzzle, or anything else in the game)?  I would personally do this as I enjoy helping others but I don't want to map travel to every map and just sit there and watch map chat for someone asking for help.  Rather, I'd like to do some content on my own and then if someone joined me, I would be happy to stop doing what I was to help them. 
---
How about someone who just feels lonely and posts on LFG looking for someone to talk with?  That is definitely not group content in the sense of raids or dungeons.  But from what you are saying, not only would they not be allowed to do that, but can get reported for that and would get in trouble for it?
---
How about someone asking for helping to find the most effective route to farm winterberries and for someone to guide them?  I'd guess that isn't allowed?
---
Do you see my point?  I completely get not wanting certain things like buying/selling on LFG, but making it group content is pretty vague.  It also seems very wrong (to me) to temporarily ban players who are just looking for some help, who have game questions, or just wanting someone to talk with and spend time with.  
---
I take group content to mean social group experiences and I look at LFG as an easy way to find other people who are interested in the same social activities you are interested in whether that's doing a raid, a fractal, completing a map together, and so much more.  Even with harvesting, long time ago, I did a harvesting route with friends because it just made it more fun and social.  We can talk, harvest, do some side events as they come up, and more.
---
Personally, I'd request that you take all this feedback (from myself and others) and actually make a thread requesting additional feedback from the players.  The LFG is for the players, right?  So why not find out what the players want and don't want from their LFG in the game?
---
I would then request taking all the feedback and meeting with other Anet Team members and meetings to revisit the policies on this.  And keeping the players aware and allowing their input during the process.  And making sure players are told the final results.
---
Regardless, I think it would also help to make this clear on the LFG itself.  Before today, I knew buying/selling weren't allowed (which I thought included raids), but not allowing just to be helpful and social to invite others to enjoy entering your home instance with you (no buying or selling)?  That's new to me.
---
yeah ummm... that was a joke. I already have a legendary - Nevermore earned the hard way.
---
Got it to work again! A restart helped. :)
---
Ah ty for the updaate, I'll try that if I encounter it again!

Tbh, just let people inyour Home Instance for free, most will be generous and send some Gold per mail.

I honestly believe you would of loved ffxiv if the  graphics were improved.

Which was already covered in my original post ...
---
Personal story is absolutely group content. The other people progress their story too, not just the owner

The comment section doesn't seem to agree with you. Lighten up, bud.
---
We would like to announce that will we be announcing something in a future announcement.
---
The error message should go to /dev/null when you don't specify where it has to go, but I don't know how Windows is supposed to handle it. It's not a critical error that stops execution either, right? So d3d9.dll might try to warn you about some memory that keeps getting allocated, but it might also be an unrelated error.
---
Is there anything else in the stack? When I crash, it's usually when a program tries to access structured data that either doesn't exist yet, or no longer exists.

If you are low on RAM or cpu speed, no matter the graphics card, you will suffer.

Hi guys,
---
I'm currently downloading the game and really want to get into GW2 as I'm enticed by the WvW battles.
---
I was wondering, what class should I play so I can be a healer, or as close to one as possible, I realise there isn't the distinct trinity of classes in this game.
---
I'm wanting to take part in pretty much just WvW content, I'm not too fussed about the PvE side of things.
---
You said all of the devs who worked on the original engine and GW2 release are gone. This is not true. There are people who worked on both versions that are still there and heavily involved with development on both games.
---
&gt;In this season, Djinn’s Dominion has been added to ranked play.
---
Oooo
---
It will be right after the ERP.
---
There's no content in a home instance that requires a group to complete.  It's just farming nodes.  Entering it in a party is supposed to be for people who are playing the game together, not so you can invite people to farm your nodes.
---
I don't understand what your point is
---
&gt; Who knows, maybe, one day, we lose the zone loading screens as well. Haha...ha...
---
Not in Guild Wars 2.
---
It would require a ton of game design changes to make that work. Not even mentioning the technology rework.
---
Yes. It's dead. We're all bots. You're one, too.
---
&gt; Personally, I'd request that you take all this feedback (from myself and others) and actually make a thread requesting additional feedback from the players. The LFG is for the players, right? So why not find out what the players want and don't want from their LFG in the game?
---
&gt; I would then request taking all the feedback and meeting with other Anet Team members and meetings to revisit the policies on this. And keeping the players aware and allowing their input during the process. And making sure players are told the final results.
---
None of this will happen.  Home Instances are not group content.  There's nothing in them that requires a group to complete.
---
Twitch is not a valid indicator for whether a game is dead or not.
---
I play all day on my ranger with fewer deaths while playing solo.  It just takes practice.
---
HoT was bad too, you MUST learn how mobs behave and be proactive.
---
Yeah, I'm taking it as a given that after 7+ years we're not going to see them gone anymore.
---
There is some shit you can buy off the TP, right? I would consider that non-hard :-)
---
Does the outfit poop out Joko?
---
WTB: player trade functionality.
---
I appreciate it! I was really trying to branch into something else with those.  
---
Yeah after reading most responses I think I agree it'd be best to use it as an outro or something. I have a few other ideas for intros that I could try out for sure and keep the time down to a few seconds.
---
Only a commie would give access to their home instance for free./s
---
seeing that nevermore is event hunting and item scavenging for the most part, I think it's fair to say that nevermore is obtainable only the hard way
---
That depends on your objective, doesn't it? I am working on Skyscale mount, equipping my latest 80 with ascended gear, and getting all of my 'babies' through HoT and PoF. I am very busy in there.
---
So definitely not dead for me!
---
Finally an event that includes living world seasons! Looking forward to spending more time in those again.
---
imagine not having gobbler and perma xp boost everywhere
---
Holy shit I forgot all about the duffel kerfuffle
---
Chances are it'll be in the Gem Store as well. If Anet hates anything it's having any sort of special status symbol rare items that the average person can't obtain by dumb luck or slight perseverance.
---
It better be added to the gemstore afterwards. Otherwise they’re just doing this to themselves
---
This is the exact opposite of predatory man. The other dudes don't give you more when you spend more money, they give you LESS per dollar when you spend less money. They just package it as giving you more if you spend more.   
---
That way if you go to buy an item that costs 950 gems, when you look at the 1200 gem pack you might think, "Well, since I am here maybe I should get the better deal, since I would be getting more gems per dollar." It is one of my most hated practices, and I am so glad ANet doesn't do it.
---
Too bad I work all day on the 30th. Might be able to catch a stream or two in the morning. 
---
Also would have liked armor pieces, instead of an outfit. 
---
But if I can get it, I will. There's a weird lack of Aurene-themed content in the game.
---
Correct, the gen 2.1 legendaries are recraftable.  2.0 are not (afaik)
---
Thats a stupid position to hold for an mmo.
---
Is it going on the gemstore afterwards? It damn well better. Or else they’re in for hellfire lol
---
People really need to understand that
---
That’s a load of poppycock and you know it. I had plenty of *attention* when I played GW2. I was the primary source of PvP AT content and casts. Many of my videos covering that subject are the most popular as they stand and remain relevant. 
---
I don’t need an exit video for clicks. I did it to expose where I think ArenaNet’s weaknesses are. Simple as.
---
I don't see why I can't buy 72 gems if I so please. Even if they have to keep it to exact dollar values to avoid rounding error abuses, I should be able to pick how many dollars I want to spend, using the online shop.
---
how is this peak endgame when top players are hitting 40k smh
---
It’s already gonna be hell if they don’t make it available in the store later. If it’s also the first and only swimsuit, they’re condemning themselves to an eternity of suffering. The backlash would be so big I’d almost not be mad cause it’d be so fun to watch
---
The game is very casual so people are not interested in watching anything engaging on twitch.
---
You made the point that this is a pointless and useless thing for the game to have as the extra exp is not needed from what you can recall about your experience while leveling mastery. I decided to point out that it is useful. Its useful to newer players, returning players, players that might pick up the game after the announcement on the 30th, even vets that just havnt bothered with getting all the masteries done yet. 
---
You may not have "needed" the extra exp but it is useful to many players.
---
Anet releases about 4 episodes a year, a detective case probably isn't going to be one of them unless the case is heavily entwined with the main story.  It would be the perfect type of thing for a side quest.  But gw2 doesn't have side quests.  Or even the desire to produce that much content.  Its very disappointing how side characters are never really developed through a side quest system. I would happily trade all the heart quests for side quests that developed the characters.
---
Shhh! You'll get us all memory-wiped! They don't know we know!
---
\&gt;*calling the gw2 branded dragon emblem thing a "very special outfit"*
---
[the real reason people got upset over KFT:](#s "region locks and upgrade from f2p for free")
---
You miss the intent of the comment completely. The severity of any potential backlash is directly connected to the amount of unfulfilled hype. This is true for any product ever.
---
Better off getting a job and life priorities in line before gaming.
---
I didn't say they hadn't announced it read what I said which was "essentially season 5 is the same as season 4 but with something like build templates it could hurt GW2 bad" where in that did I say build templates weren't announced I was pointing out that just adding build templates while focusing on doing the same as season 4 will hurt GW2. Reading is a virtue you know.
---
[Is this going to destroy your vision of hot dogs?](https://i.imgur.com/ziysA3a.png)
---
Thats because the content is not good enough to justify sub fee. Current business model pushes game development even further down, due to necessity of releasing some of rewards through gemstore instead of gameplay.
---
Gw2 cant be redeemed at this point. And Im still not going to pay for gems. If there are idiots who keep paying for my free content, what can I say... Its their problem.
---
it would have been a good side quest series =/
---
The game can be played for free.
---
So there's no point watching it on twitch when you can just go play it yourself.  
---
When people want to see someone playing to get some pointers or a guide, they go to youtube instead.
---
&gt; You made the point that this is a pointless and useless thing
---
I did nothing of the sort as I said you cut off and ignored my post
---
"is Mastery XP the thing that is holding them back? Honest question here. Not being snarky"
---
But the amount of hype also have rather little to do what is actually being said, and way more to do with what the vocal part of the community decides that it should be.
---
They actually meant ketchup. Next expansion comes at McDonalds.
---
Im not crying for a key im just saying that if anyone has one key left and doesnt mind giving it to me i would appreciate. Im still playing the game whether i have expansion or not.
---
9 chances to get codes, I don't see a reason to get upset. :D
---
GW2 is a bad streaming game, that's it.
---
$60k-$100k (lets be honest probably closer to $60k) doesn't seem like a lot of money for the Seattle region.
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?
---
Due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator+subreddit%3Aguildwars2&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).

---
Know what would be great? When we could do and ingame event(chain) where we could earn it by playing the game instead of watching a live stream for a chance. I really would love to have more achievable in game without week long grind or just buying it in the gem store.
---
I'm afraid this will backfire like the tea stuff.
---
Id be up for it, Im sure a lot of community members would be, too... 
---
But Im not sure weve seen any crossovers from ANet (or any NCSoft game) besides that NCSoft Brawler that crashed and burned a few years ago
---
As theres a WoW Streamer with 36k
---
How dare people complain on shitty business habits! If you all have no life everyone shouldn't either!!!!!
---
Bad English and no money... must be fun!
---
In fact, it's the only way they can now enter the PvP queue.
---
No I don't want them to quote the whole comment but to try to understand what the person is saying.
---
so if I am saying things like "is Mastery XP the thing that is holding them back? Honest question here. Not being snarky." maybe, just maybe I am not saying its pointless and useless but am in fact asking a question about how other people's experience, to include new players that you ask, are going through.
---
They just fill up on first day of use. It's a laptop on a dusty zone.
---
begging? you talking like if i were here crying in the post. If you read what i said you should understand what im saying
---
No, you're the one who needs to understand that Anet needs to start supporting twitch. When people on reddit say Gw2 is not being advertised properly, they mean it, and this thread is proof of that. People really think Gw2 is dead because it has no presence anywhere.
---
lol, it is just reminder and bringing up new info about streamers, that was not obtainable before they told us about the announcement...
---
If you are not a revenant, thief or necromancer, this is all you will get:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_Leeching
---
Life steal created a lot of balance problems in GW1, so they keep it under wraps in GW2.
---
That is BAD ASS dude. Go work for Anet right now!!
---
“It’s a laptop” oh
---
Asking for a free expansion key is begging per our rules.
---
It was a dream, tho. 
---
I don't think they'll pay for napping.
---
Okay, after the fourth read I understood what you're talking about. Trinity. You mean trinity.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Movement_Speed
---
tl;dr
---
Get a swiftness source and forget passive movement speed bonuses because they dont stack, only the biggest bonus is present.
---
How do you think hype works?
---
What are you guys talking about,  am I the only one who beats the story and never has enough mastery points to level up? I don't find it so easy to master a trait by playing casually. I have to look up achievements to earn mastery points and stuff like that. Which is hard  for me as most mastery points (except the vista-like ones) I find kind of hard to achieve.
---
Anet can't balance the game as it is now, could you imagine it after dual classes?
---
It'd also homogenize the game even more.
---
I think I am at something like master level 150, and have been that way since I finished the POF maps. There is plenty of masteries I don't have, but they aren't really important enough to worry about getting.
---
RIP Rytlock
---
That thing went up in flames faster than a moth at a bonfire.
---
Game is not dead. Players here simply rather play it than spectate.

---
I often offer my hike at no charge.  Happy to do it.  Some people will send some coin via mail as a thank you.  It’s appreciated but I never expect.
---
Similar to Mesmer portals.  I occasionally see someone predatory who will want gold.  So I will usually hop on my Mesmer, pay them, then start offering ports for free because I’d prefer to help people rather than someone make money off them.
---
Yes there are so many free lfgs I was wondering why anyone would pay someone who sells the group
---
TIL there are people who are not interested enough to go to the event for it's content but would actually go there and sit through this (for them totally boring) event for a skin in the game the event they are not interested in is all about.
---
"stat selectable" exotics for badges? Are you sure?
---
&gt;Life steal created a lot of balance problems in GW1
---
It wasn't really the lifesteal that caused the problems, it was expertise being paired with high cost, short cooldown skills that bypass armour.
---
It’s fair enough isn’t it to try and catch people up? That’s pretty typical MMO pre-expansion stuff. Wow, Rift, etc have been doing that sort of thing for years. Especially if the new zones will support some of the HoT and PoF mastery mechanics such as jumping mushroom and such.
---
This would be an ADDITIONAL 10 rows below the character row.
---
Asking something or begging for something is different. If you dont understand that then...
---
One possibility is that they are going to introduce dual classes that work sortof like that WvW event: you get the weapon skills of one profession and the utilities of another. 
---
The WvW event could have been a sort of test run of the coding, and although I'm sure it wouldn't have been without any effort required, I would imagine that implementing this as a feature would require fewer resources than implementing an entirely new elite spec. There would probably be some coding challenges, but the main coding for each of the skills would already be done, and planning wise it would presumably take far less work than designing an entirely new theme/mechanic (the mechanic would require coding, too) for each elite spec, along with designing all of the new weapon and utility skills and doing the animations for all of the new ones.
---
Now I'm not saying any of this means it's definitely likely that they'd be doing this. I am just observing that it would make sense if we found that a now lower resource studio was introducing this as a big new feature.
---
Wait 24 hrs and try again.  Happened to me when GW2 launched from Beta.
---
Eh.  I disagree.  The problem was more complicated than that.  The best xp farm back then used to be grinding out the veteran tigers and spiders.   Most adventures were gated behind metas,  half of the dynamic events weren't around back then,  and the metas were either overturned or gave fuck all for experience.
---
I dont think people would have complained nearly as much if the road to completion was paved in engaging content vs grinding mobs.
---
So I think in the target for stuff like this. I've got POF but haven't completed the story nor unlocked all the Mount masteries. Heck I am still working on auto loot from core Tyrian
---
This might help people like me
---
I understand the difference between the words very well. Per our rules they are the same thing. You are asking for paid content for free, that is begging under our rules.
---
The issue is that they have not given them proper closure regarding their status. 
---
They were simply mentioned as "btw they doing this now" which begs people to ask why mention them at all.
---
And even if they aren't mentioned, it makes people wonder why Anet rather keep Brahm around (during his emo phase) than Kasmeer who was around for the entire PoF storyline but suddenly disappeared when Season 4 came around.
---
If yu ask me, I personally don't like Majory, and I think she should have shown up more during events relevant to her (HoT since blah blah vengeance against Mordremoth) 
---
And I strongly dislike how Anet likes to pull out characters they have "shelved somewhere" whenever they feel like.
---
Oh Caithe is busy taking care of Aurene in Tarir, let's pull her out now. 
---
Inb4 Zojja is still in shelved state and they can't figure when to pull her out. 
---
And next we probably gonna have them pull out members of the Orders for some final battle scene for 1 episode and then back into the shelf they go.
---
where did I say its not fair?
---
Alright I'm done here. Apparently I shouldn't have asked the question in the first place.
---
Well then why the game developers dont create a way for f2p players to get expansions.?
---
I mean, Arenanet made skins the main "content" of their game, of course many people will want them.
---
Oof 😂
---
Twitch support falls under the umbrella of general marketing so I'd say they need to work on that before talking about streaming.
---
I've been seeing several posters daydreaming about revenants with floating greatswords. Is that a meme or something?
---
People mostly like to watch endgame content like pvp and raids but those game modes are on their way out.
---
Casual open world stuff is less attractive to viewers but tons of people play that content all the time, so the game “looks” dead on twitch while the player base is stable for casual content in game.
---
Man I accidentally picked *such* a good time to come back to this game!
---
Company announces future thing.  
---
Fans interpret thing in terms of what they wish the product to be. Fans become excited about imagined and potential details of thing, as there is a scarcity of information around thing at the announcement.  
---
Fans discuss imagined and potential details of thing with one another, generating hype. Thing is imagined to solve current problems that fans have with product.   
---
Company releases thing with details that are different from what fans imagined.  
---
Fans become upset because of the difference between imagined and potential details of thing, and actual details of thing. Fans blame company for not adding details of thing that fans wanted, and for thing not solving issues that the community has with existing products.  
---
That's generally how hype works for the gaming crowd, which has notoriously high expectations.
---
&gt; Light class cannot wield shields
---
Chronomancer can.
---
How old is your pc/how realistic are your fps expectations when it comes to the game?
---
Well it’s reasonable for episodes between seasons to have a longer gap. Also we don’t know what they release order will be for season five.
---
And? What does that have to do with Arenanets willingness to make legendarys easier?
---
It has no relevance at all.
---
They won't make it easier because some people buy gems to make legendarys, **YOU** may not do that but that is not relevant to what I'm saying.
---
&gt; yeah ummm... that was a joke.
---
Hard to tell in text with some people asking Arenanet to lower the difficulty of the living story... and being dead serious about it.
---
Actually we're getting closer to crackdowns on lootbox/gacha/whatever else crap mobile games pull to make money off of people with gambling addictions. It's not rising, it's most likely going to level off or drop dramatically. Mobile games are boring when you peel back that layer of paying for random ""Surprise elements""".
---
Iam still hoping Season 5 with hall of monuments and GW3 announcement. Its been so many years...iam getting a bit tired of GW2 lately.
---
"Is the game dead" ? - No.
---
My apologies - I assumed you got a kickback or something.
---
But for wow you need subscription...easier to watch for free, get same boring content, but actually having fun because of professional entertainer behind the camera.
---
It is about the person, not about the game.
---
Then perhaps more than a post on the website would be helpful, since it won't reach them people.
---
The people who haven't done content aren't the ones that have issues with lack of content.
---
Ubisoft is the biggest offender of this. Oh hey, here's 200 free currency!!
---
\&gt;Most items are 750 and above
---
\&gt;First price point is 500 currency for $5.
---
i am maxed out on lvl 80 toons and i have 295 mastery and more spirit shards than i can spend. i guess this event isnt for me.
---
and it also looks like we wont be getting season 5 until after september 17.
---
Developers are not required to give everything for free. Every single Free To Play title has paid content. If this is your first one then you should learn to understand that.
---
F2P accounts get access to the entire base game with some minor restrictions. If you want to play the expansions, you have to buy them. There are 50% off sales pretty often that you can take advantage of.
---
I was really wondering what not having a third game yet had to do with life steal
---
I told myself that once I reached 20k I'd stop caring about AP. I'm now at 29.2k and don't see myself stopping at 30k.
---
Otherwise, they could follow the strategy used in Halo 3: ODST, where they had gates between districts, so they only had to load up the next area over when you approached it.
---
We still have massive cliffs surrounding most maps, so if each map portal is changed into a tunnel or something, it could be made to behave in a similar way. Replace loading screens with a closed-off pathway in between maps.
---
Bellevue itself can be expensive depending on which area of Bellevue (downtown is absurd), but it also has the benefit of having plenty of surrounding areas that are much cheaper, especially as they get further from Seattle. Before living with a significant other, I lived comfortably by myself in a pretty roomy apartment in Issaquah (east of Bellevue) back when I was making around 40k. You can do just fine on 60-100k if you don't live *in* Seattle.
---
Ah, I assumed because of the general purple glow.
---
Anything for veteran players during this Event?
---
How is Healing Signet similar to lifesteal?
---
Calling it now, we are going North, to ~~vabbi~~ Jormag!
---
Well.. that sound more like a you issue than a game issue. Or would you prefer them simply not releasing new stuff? Surely starting up the game and downloading around 150 or so mb every other week should be fully doable even if you have a 56k modem?
---
I think all it means is 3 living world and 1 expansion team like when MO was game director but thats just my opinion.
---
Why dont u upgrade your internet speed? Economic reasons or something else?
---
then maybe just let it download once over night? 500kb/s is not much, but it's very manageable.
---
That's very interesting, as I assumed players would prefer the opposite.  I wondered if maybe PvPers disliked the "side mechanic" of some of these maps, and instead preferred open fighting.  Probably due to me listening to all those WvW tryhards mewling about only wanting "fights" and hating on the "PvE" elements of the game mode.
---
Because my first impression is exactly as has been described: small map, easy to navigate, therefore easier to get into fights.  
---
I should mention I've been playing on a Thief w/shortbow, so obviously being able to cross the map quickly is something I find attractive.
---
They lost more than they intended since there were volunteers that left. Those positions that they didn't intend to lose have to be filled back up. Also, the layoffs were 7 months ago, for projects that weren't going well. They have to start new projects in order to continue to exist. Were they going to pay people to do nothing for 7 months while they figured out how to go from there? Are they never allowed to hire anyone ever again? How long would you consider appropriate to start hiring again?
---
Hmm,  I think using the star outfit and just dyeing it whatever solid color you want for someone like Poison Ivy, who doesn't have an outfit that even remotely has that effect, is super low-effort. Might be better used for someone like Donna Troy, who *has* worn that space effect in the past.
---
However, I really like the Hawkgirl! I don't think I've ever seen anyone do a Hawkgirl cosplay in GW2 before, and you did a really good job with it.
---
Is this really what the world has become? We now get random people calling out devs for delivering patches because it takes too long for a random person to download? Be happy, considering the funding this game gets, it's surprising we get patches at all. 
---
Having 500 kbs download is nobodie's problem but yours.
---
Not sure what sort of support you were looking for when that dim bulb lit up in your head and you managed to conjure up an idea that this might actually be a worthwhile and widespread issue to have a discussion with a fruitful resolution of the issue other than you getting a better connection and not complaining when a developer releases a patch...
---
I know many would not agree, but for me lineage 2 c4 with BD looks and GW 2 combat would be perfect :). 
---
U may think it crazy, but being scared to go level coz some pk may kill u or mobs are too hard , or waiting Baium spawn fight, man l2 was something :/.....awesome!
---
Jawgeous deserved better. I personally didn't pay too much attention to him, but he clearly put a lot of effort into the videos he produced for GW2 and he did a pretty good job. Honestly, the GW2 community was lucky to have him and ArenaNet doesn't deserve content creators like that with how little support they get from ArenaNet.
---
People have been saying this way before twitch was any metric for anything.
---
People say that, because Anet literally did not advertise GW2. As in traditional marketing. There was one TV ad that had almost nothing to do with the game, maybe some banner ads on gaming sites, and then nothing else. It was only recently did they start buying ad space plastering literal walls of popular cities with GW2 adverts, and actually start buying ads on platforms such as Facebook. Nearly 7 years after launch.
---
Anet did try the whole partner thing. The problem is not many people made all that great of content. Companies can't really force that, and if anything Anet is proof of this. They backed people, promoted people, and it didn't really work out. None of them really caught on with the community, and none of them broke out of the community. The person people know of most outside of the GW2 community, is known because of drama with someone who part of the development team.
---
On the other hand, games like FFXIV actively tried to kill any monitization of any content involving video of their game, and required copyright information embedded in the actual fucking videos made of their game. As far as I can tell, they still don't have anyone they are officially partnered with, who they promote in any sense. Neither does ESO (which is on 2 more platforms than GW2, and pulls the exact same numbers).
---
People need to stop looking at WoW as the trend, and realize it's the exception in every single category. MMOs generally don't pull big viewership numbers, because MMOs are generally boring to watch. The only MMO with over 10k veiwers is WoW with 70k, and the next closest is RuneScape is 6k. The exception is 70k, the trend is less than 1k. No one watches MMOs on twitch. That's not an Anet problem, that's a genre problem.
---
you made me stop breathing there...
---
&gt; The 10GB part might not be accurate, as the percentage refers to the  number of files left and not the files sizes, but when I reach 1GB and  it's only 5% done, it's easy to figure that the download must be at  least 10GB before it's all caught up. 
---
only if the size of a file is always the same which is not the case, some files are only 3kb others 10 mb so no you can´t calculate the patch size only with files downloaded a downloaded file size.
---
I think you're the one not learning anything from this exchange.
---
This, they missed a big opportunity to revive the feeling of hunting elite skills in GW1.
---
Masteries should have had specific attached challenges to unlock them, like "complete an activity using your mount to unlock a new skill" kind of stuff.
---
Because the content was garbage. Make specific challenges where you have to use the mastery skills and it won't suck.
---
They tied traits to random bosses and meta events. Of course it was terrible.
---
And all that is solved with companies not announcing partial information amd only marketing when they are ready to release actual details. And also generally being more transparent when they do decide to announce things.
---
&gt; I'm happy to hear there's not a single cookie-cutter build per class.
---
Build variation is simple but complex in GW2. It's easy to use, but there are a lot of variations.
---
For starters, you have 5 available trait lines for each profession. You can select any 3 of those 5 to be active, so that's 10 possible combinations of trait lines. Having a trait line active automatically gives you 3 'minor' traits that are always active. Additionally, you get 3 'major' traits which you select. Those three are referred to as Adept, Master, and Grandmaster. For each of those, there are 3 options. So you choose 1 of the 3 Adept, 1 of the 3 Master, and 1 of the 3 Grandmaster traits. So, that's 9 combinations of traits on each of 3 lines in 10 different possible combinations of trait lines, or 270 combinations. 
---
Then you throw the monkey wrench into it because Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire expansions each added an "elite specialization" trait line to each profession. You can only have one elite specialization trait line active at a time and it's always loaded in the 3rd line, so you can have the elite line plus 2 of the original 5 trait lines active. That means another 10 possible line combinations with 27 possible trait combinations per line and there are 2 elite specs to choose from, so you're up to a total of 810 possible combinations of traits and the trait lines are different for each profession.
---
All of that is before you even look at attributes, sometimes called stats. There are 4 primary stats that each have base a value of 1000 at level 80 (max level). At level 1, they have a value of 37 and they increase as you gain levels.
---
* Power (how hard you hit)
---
* Precision (how likely you are get a critical hit)
---
* Toughness (inherent damage reduction)
---
* Vitality (health)
---
There are also 5 secondary attributes that each have a value base of 0.
---
* Concentration (increases boon duration for your boons)
---
* Condition Damage (increases damage per tick from your condis)
---
* Expertise (increases condi duration)
---
* Ferocity (increases the multiplier for your critical hits)
---
* Healing Power (increases your outgoing healing)
---
All 9 of those have their value increased depending on which equipment you use. That includes armor, weapons, and trinkets (2x ring, 2x earring, 1x amulet). They're also increased by which food you've eaten and which "utility" you've used (crystals, stones, etc).
---
At max level, armor/weapons/trinkets come in two versions; 3-slot and 4-slot. The 3-slot versions give a big boost to a primary attribute and a smaller boost to 2 seconday attributes. The 4-slot versions boost 2 primary and 2 secondary, but the boosts are a bit smaller to keep things more or less balanced.
---
Then, just to keep it from getting boring, there are Runes you can add to your armor, Sigils you can add to your weapons, and doohickeys (can't remember the official name) that you can add to your trinkets. Each of these will increase stats and/or provide additional effects too.
---
Wheeeeeeeeee....  If you've run out of build options, you're not doing it right.
---
&gt; if you wanted to raid - it was clear that you need to use a specific one.
---
To be fair, that's pretty much true in GW2 which is why so many people totally ignore Raids and many people consider the Raiding community to be elitist jerks.
---
That's part of why my first response to you said to avoid Raids. Open-world PvE is a lot less stress, it's a hell of a lot of fun, and you have a ridiculous amount of open-world content available to you.
---
Lots of people read just fine, and take the time to do so when they play a new game. That's fine if you don't, but don't pretend to speak for an entire generation.
---
They said "generally". The presence of one big WoW streamer is hardly indicative of the entire genre.
---
This game is not "dead" or "boring".
---
The people who enjoy it actually *play* it rather than watch it on Twitch. It's not really that difficult of a concept.
---
Calling it now, it will be the [Dragon Emblem *Clothing* Outift](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon_Emblem_Clothing_Outfit) with a picture of Aurene on it.
---
If ascended versions could serve as portable crafting stations, maybe someone would fucking care to make them.
---
home instance is both in story journal and central tyria, so it already has 2 lfg tabs it's valid for, with third potentially being roleplaying tab
---
I disagree. I dont want more level grind. Thats whats bad about HoT, its mastery were way too grindy.
---
They basically did this with the Pale Tree. The attack by the Shadow of the Dragon was like five years ago and the Pale Tree is still pretty down for the count. I'd much rather they at least talk about Zojja's progress even if we don't get to see her, so she doesn't feel like she's been in stasis for years. It's supposed to be a *Living* World, and brushing things off to the side just to leave the door open is counter-productive to that effect.
---
10GB is the size if you are missing around 2 years of updates.
---
You could always log in and play and see for your self.
---
By Lord, you mean Legacy of Foefire map?  I played that once, and while my team was winning, we tunnel visioned (well, they did, I was clueless) and someone took down the lord for the 150pts and the win.
---
Never underestimate people stupidity on supporting abusive anti consumer practices from those companys.
---
Esp. mobile users are prone to that and are easily abusable while they happily take every **** in from those companys
---
Yeah nice showing a account name, does this count as witch hunt?
---
Just because *you* require more reward than just "pretty landscapes" for exploring doesn't mean that the exploration element of the game isn't valid.
---
Lots of people just enjoy the sights. Not everyone needs to have currency and items shoved in their faces in order to consider something worth doing.
---
Heh ... maybe that is 6+ hours
---
The cost of the phone call and blocking the phone for that long will probably be an issue.
---
I just noticed that ... my download is around half that speed. :(
---
They pretty much threw out Marjorie's story out the window and Kasmeers ain't much better lol.
---
You get everything explained in GW2 as well. But people click it away. And then they tell you that no one tell you anything but the fact is they do. Make a new character and watch all the popups you get instead of clicking them away go through them and read it all and you get a shit ton of information.
---
MFW still no Spirit Watch.
---
*cry*
---
Yes so much this. You speak to my soul and what I’ve been saying for a while now.
---
Came back to the game around a year ago, and yes, HoT mastery xp does hold back. PoF is maxed. Core tyria it's the mastery points.
---
Actually I wanted the outfit, still do.
---
They're making it up as they go along.
---
&gt; For those that are still working through that content, is Mastery XP the thing that is holding them back?
---
If your goal is crafting legendaries, it absolutely is.  Getting spirit shards when you still have masteries to get is a huge pain in the ass.
---
Yeah, it is. You need a dedicated guild for this. With pugs it’s almost impossible. I personally don’t really buy into this make goal everyday narrative that is so common here on Reddit. I usually do whatever I want to, without making any long term goals, especially since I have most of the stuff I wanted to achieve. When I’m bored and have no other objective I usually do PvP, WvW, Fractals, Metas, JPs or Festivals. 
---
GW2 can bring a lot of fun, if you are not afraid to enjoy all types of content. Even after 5k hours it is entertaining and there is always something to do.
---
That doesn't mean anything. Many companies post job offers just to stay on the market or to gather potential employee data. Many positions are never posted publicly either.
---
Still, if you're interested, you won't lose anything by sending your resume.
---
i think they are used to making us wait 4 months or longer now. i expect at least one of the episodes will be delayed no matter how efficiently the teams work
---
I mean, I have to wonder if they don't intentionally keep the game imbalanced. After all, they basically ruin the game's balance every time a new set of pay-to-win elite specs get introduced, and you know they're doing it intentionally because one doesn't just overtune things that hard and not realize it several months after.
---
Hmm, possibly? GW1 certainly didn't feel homogenized to me, but each class in that had important primary attributes that were exclusive to each main class.
---
But you can buy keys for 150 :P
---
do you guys not have phones?
---
Well roam with your thief and play spellbreaker with bubble with your warrior in zergs. Problem solved.
---
Tbh I just want to be able to WP directly there from the rest of the world during the festival.
---
Yes
---
If anything raids having unique rewards should make raid selling -more- bannable, not less.
---
Hey Rheyo, fellow FotM guildie here. Really cool to see you doing more content!
---
*Sixteen times the details...*
---
Yeah but is this video on that platform? Does he show the name on that platform? And there is a difference quoting someone and calling him out
---
They would be mini crafting stations with an NPC and they'd be usable by your or other players cause we need more visual cancer in this game.
---
Raids didn't get new masteries since w3.
---
I WANT THE OUTFIT THATS ALL I EVER WANTED
---
Cant agree more, they tailor in these lore centered fights, give dialogue but I am forced to deal with random shit that makes the fight more annoying rather than difficult. Oh I cant attack them now, they got a light on them, oh no I cant get close to my heals cause I got a bubble, better stay away from the action to heal. Wish they would find another way rather than sticking all the shitty raid mechanics in these dungeons. if I wanted to play raid content I'd join a raid, but I don't cause their shitty
---
I love playing GW2 like everyone else, but the grinding for exp is not something I enjoy, unless I get to to pick where to get that exp, or I can use tomes (got like 6 stacks, 3k+ spirit stones, and not enough bank space for them) to fill in the exp bar.
---
I completely agree, especially about the trinity aspect. I dislike while they shoehorned it in to raids. I wish it either be came consistent throughout all of GW2 content OR I wish they had taken the opportunity to create a new aggro system under the GW2 ethos.
---
Anet are known for not paying well but having good benefits.
---
Using google search to find anything in the official forums is a fool's errand. 
---
Nothing ever properly comes out.
---
It's not only about the person. Popularity of the game is very important too. That's why there is a lot of other streamers with 1-10k viewers and even more with 100-500.
---
Sub means nothing, especially when you can buy it using in-game gold.
---
Lastly, if so many people tend to watch that "same boring wow content", why nobody is watching "super amazing gw2 content"?
---
GW2 just doesn't have as many players. I mean ACTIVE players, not those who login 2 times a week for 2hrs.
---
i'd like to agree, but I don't think that's realistic with our engine. Not to mention i'm pretty sure Halo doesn't have skyscales, griffons and kangeroo rabbits to deal with in terms of pathway-breaking..
---
Revenant, Eles, Mesmer are all characters on the squishy side. (Even though Rev wears plate weirdly enough) Though Revs do make up for it with some healing and protection
---
People have been asking this exact question over the last couple of days, why? Just look for those topics, because you'll get the same answers, along with, 'GW2 wasn't popular on twitch back when it was crazy busy, so why should it be now that we're between content releases?'
---
"Abuse" of voting system should not be moderated. Especially not on this sub, lol
---
I am not a fan of the idea, but I still think it is the kind of thing we might see.
---
Tomorrow is my turn to make another "is this game dead" thread
---
I'm sure some people were annoyed about not being an international offer, but at least for me the really irritating thing was that the kung fu tea outfit promo was never specified as region locked and they changed the wording later on, after I made an account.
---
When they did the beetle thing it was better implemented imo.
---
Ah I see, megaserver combined all pve, so people just don't have open lfg dungeon runs anymore?
---
Most of the streamer links are broken in that post; do they ever test anything?
---
&gt; Who sells home instance access
---
people that want to make some gold this way?
---
&gt;  who pays money
---
people willing to pay for it?
---
like what's the point of your question really? it's common sense
---
Seriously. I was practically yelling at the computer "What does GW3 have to do with friggin lifesteal?!"
---
lol'd
---
I don't see why they couldn't just give out the outfit for free to people like they did with the Royal Guard outfit for the third anniversary of the game.
---
People are expecting Season 5 to come with expac-level content because if it doesn't this game is fucking dead lmao
---
Hmmm ok that is possible and fair. I'll give you that.
---
Shall i remind you of scarlett? Ugh
---
What's the point of that?
---
Game's so easy and fast to progress through tho, only people who are grinding WvW ranks for legendary armor are in need of XP boosters.
---
That is a fair point. A minimum purchase isn't unreasonable.
---
But if I can buy 500 gems or 700 gems, I should be able to buy 650 or 578 if I need.
---
It's GW2 babe - game won't ever be 100% smooth.
---
You can alter some settings like Reflections, Shadows, Character Model Limit/Quality for a better performance, but even that won't prevent massive FPS drops from time to time. 
---
I have upgraded my CPU recently (Ryzen 3700X), was hoping to see massive improvement in performance, but I was wrong. Game engine is just too bad.
---
There will not be dual classes. I can say that with 100% confidence. Those were a huge part of why they had to stop development on GW1. We aren't seeing them come back.
---
The racial skills were originally supposed to replace them, but that mantle has been moved over the elite specs. The last wave of elites were even largely designed to be "x fighting as y" as if they *were* dual classes.
---
Uh.
---
My money. Please. Take all of it?
---
yea it's almost as the idiotic reddit mantra of "level to 80 normally" that keeps being thrown around here makes no sense, right?
---
now can we stop regurgitating this "gospel" and acknowledge it's shitty advice that accomplishes nothing and teaches a player absolutely nothing of value?
---
The side story state directly that Rytlock has children. Not to say that there aren't plenty of gay people who have been socially forced into heterosexual relationships by any means, but...
---
Make my boy Bi, damnit.
---
Would they put that under the Living World badge though? They specifically said it is a Living World related announcement.
---
Wait. What happened in apex?
---
&gt; Braindead bullshit, you can't read. Try again.
---
You don't want to pay for skins and I'm telling you to stop being an entitled stingy whining little freeloader and pay for the things you want, like adults do. But you sure proved me wrong, good discussion mr "you got no interest in a real conversation".
---
You clearly think that your &lt;0.04€ ph is worth endless service from Anet because you paid once. I would love to hear you explain how that's any different from me suggesting I pay your company once for endless services. That's **exactly what you are asking from Anet**. Maybe you should "learn to read" your own words?
---
&gt;Link to HoT and PoF for free? See, you are full of shit. Even others called you out earlier for this.
---
I thought you said HoT and PoF didn't give enough content to be worth the money? Do you want to take some time to pick a consistent argument? Either the free version of the game is "just a trial" because the expansions have too much content to miss out on, or the expansions are not worth it because of a lack of content. You can't have both. Which one of us is braindead again?
---
&gt;But to paying customers. Which was the point, if you would be able to read. Keep in mind that I'm not complaining about cosmetic shop content.
---
This is my point, you are *barely* a paying customer. You are at best, worth 0.04€ ph to Anet (And that's me being generous as I'm fairly certain you have way more hours than 3000; that's right I did notice you failed to mention your /age). That might as well be nothing, you can leave and Anet won't miss you. You're not a paying customer, you're an irrelevant freeloader.
---
&gt;Anet has never released population data afterwards except stuff as "fastest growing" when refering to the first weeks after release. With new player experience they indicated with some statements that GW2 struggles to keep players for long enough active to even reach max. level. By my own experience in guilds are out of 500 players just \~5 players sticking with the game. All others leave. *blah blah blah*
---
This is a lot of words trying to explain how bad the game is by someone who is clearly obsessed with it and can't stop playing despite how much you hate it.
---
&gt; Shows that you got no clue, kid. Value also depends on the quality of entertainment.
---
Ooh you called me a kid lmao. I remember when I was 17 and I thought that was a cool insult. 
---
Like I said, if you only got 50h of "quality entertainment" out of the expansions, and yet you continued to play it for 2 years while not enjoying the game, you are a moron who clearly has nothing better to do (Except for of course your "career" which you "work hard" on, clearly).
---
&gt;Every free to play MMO would outcompete GW2 by far in such comparisions.
---
What number do you think you get when you divide 0 by something? Also you didn't answer how low you would need it to be, 0.02€? 0.00001€? In the negatives? Do you want to get *paid* to play games? Just how cheap are you?
---
&gt;Going to school is important, yes. I recommend you to focus on school and to stop playing GW2, because apparently is your education currently at best on the level of a first grader. Especially math and physics is important and can later help you to build a career, so you should try to get some good grades. 
---
Wow this is edgy lol, such intellectual much triggered. Listen my dude, it's not my fault your lack of work ethic means you don't earn enough money and you're not willing to work harder so instead you beg for handouts in a videogame lmao.
---
You should've spent more time working on your skill-set and less time nurturing that massive chip on your shoulder. Every single complaint you people have would be solved if you worked harder and earned more money. No matter what you try to say, however you try to explain it, it will always come back to you being too cheap to pay for things.
---
Get a week-end job, do a course to improve your employability, do something, *anything*, to improve your life instead of playing videogames that you hate and begging for freebies. I do maths tuition every other Sunday, six students at 25€ per hour is 150€. But if you don't have marketable skills you can just work in a supermarket, go and stack shelves, get up off your ass and **do something**, and you'll earn money. That's how the real world works.
---
Anet will never cater to pathetic entitled freeloaders, and I'll keep spending money on the gemstore just to make sure that they never do.
---
IDK, ask millions of people on twitch. 
---
Answer is simple: because people like X game and anything related with it. Why do people watch football instead of playing it? Because it's fun even to watch.
---
I personally like to have some stream on my 2nd monitor, while playing the game.
---
Knowing what ncsoft is up to, my guess sadly is 1.
---
Which leaves you with 50 left over and nothing to spend that on. And then if you buy another 200 pack, you have 250, which you still can spend on nothing of value - and if you buy keys again, then you *still* have gems left over and need to buy more *again* to make a purchase.
---
See how this keeps on happening and you keep on spending money in this scenario, because the gems never come to a proper purchase equally?
---
Yes, he clearly put a lot of thought into a video where he goes on a white-hot foaming rage about Mesmer having cleansing 1 condi on Jaunt despite the class being made of paper and having almost no source of condi cleanse.
---
Why are you using paypal? Online banking is easier and without the fee (atleast in europe)
---
Well, you can draw the demons everywhere, but I doubt that PvP, WvW, raid, guild teams non existence as well as other major problems with current state of the game are not the fault of Anet...
---
There's plenty of software these days, I still use xpadder, cause it just works, and I like making the graphics :x
---
I used Xpadder for years with combat mode. Though still reached for the mouse to manage bank/inventory, talk to npc's. So never really was 100% controller.
---
Firebrands’ staff and blasting fields is also worth mentioning for might. But I agree with everything you said!
---
in seriousness, what are you expecting?
---
I for one just await regular "LS5 will release in X months"
---
Everyone attending the event will get a code for the new outfit but only a select few watching will get a code via giveaways. Why not do what other games do and giveaway the code to everyone watching the stream? This is why Anet fail with regard to streaming.
---
So am I not allowed to use LFG to advertise for company to map with? I know I don't -need- people to clear a map with, but I like to.
---
A lot hangs on this.
---
So just more wasted effort then by the devs.
---
haha, you said dungeons
---
The new sale announcements seem to show up on Tuesdays.  So we should see this weeks list tomorrow sometime around patch time.
---
&gt; Probably due to me listening to all those WvW tryhards mewling about only wanting "fights" and hating on the "PvE" elements of the game mode.
---
Yeah siegeing T3 keep with shield gens and surrealistic amount of AC is total fun. Problem is not in PvE, but in overall balance of that aspect of WvW. Atm it is easier just have fun making fights in prime time, while leaving all PvE stuff on will of "team that have biggest night crew".
---
I really do hope for some more Sylvari themed outfits/armour and hair styles for our foliage friends!
---
Well that would definitely be part of their plan! You're in luck.
---
Yep it's another classic case of Anet wasting perfectly good content. Which is why so many players are disappointed in the direction of the game, not that it's bad, but just frustrated with the untapped potential everywhere.
---
For PvP Anet really should add this stuff into unranked or a weekly "fun" game modes queue with the other non-conquest maps.
---
And we should care why? Name an MMO that doesn't have people leaving when their favorite class is nerfed. I used to use the phantasm build to. It was my favorite build to use. But I don't get into an MMO expecting to use the same build year after year, because that's not really how MMOs work. I know at some point, changes will be made that I have to adapt to. That's pretty much every MMO I've ever played. I've never played an MMO that didn't change something I liked.
---
I used to play a dual pistol thief with riccochet and they removed that entire trait.  Felt bad man. But I like the thief build I'm using now as much or more, even though it took me a while to find it.
---
The lack of a trinity system was a major selling point to me, and it continues to be one of my favorite things in the game. There are many reasons I don't like the trinity system and I've listed them multiple times, so I won't repeat them here, but man. I hope they never go full on trinity in this game.
---
No, it was intended but people reacted poorly because they hate having to actually play the game.
---
Casual players don't talk in twitch emotes.. Nice try homicidal maniac! You belong behind bars!
---
If they'd raised the level cap like most games, it'd only be like another 2.5m-&gt;5m XP which wouldn't take very long at all.
---
When HoT launched it was like 60m-80m XP to max everything.
---
How is that a problem again? Fashion wars is just a long-running joke, and with "fashion" being locked behind harder content you actually lock it out for more people than putting it behind a paywall, so what you want to do is create a special showoff of your skill which is in direct contrast to the whole point of fashion wara
---
My GTX 1080 it bottlenecking me (with reshade)
---
We all have to look up achievements to earn mastery points.
---
This is mostly a discussion about how easy the XP is to earn.
---
Awesome, I'll contact you when I'm back from vacation :)
---
What do pulse and tick on skill descriptions mean exactly? Specifically, I'm trying to understand how choking gas on the short bow works, but generally I'd like a primer on how skills work (things like what happens when enemies exit a combo field, the aforementioned explanation of pulse, what the red bars under skills means, for example).
---
A core philosophy of GW2 is not being shoehorned into specific content but being given multiple avenues to progress. I like the fact that mastery XP is earned by participating in any content in the expansion. Specific stuff is required for mastery points but there's always a surplus of those, so you can skip some.
---
no
---
Yeh the gear you get from boosting to lvl 80 is really bad. Even if a new player is asking me for tips, I would advice them to stay away from gear with toughness and/or vitality. All this does is make newbies reliant on tanking damage that they should be evading/blocking thru dodges or skills. Get berserker gear quick if you want to do power damage, or vipers if you want to condi, even exotics are better than soldier gear.
---
I see what you meant now, thanks. I'm kinda new to the TP.
---
