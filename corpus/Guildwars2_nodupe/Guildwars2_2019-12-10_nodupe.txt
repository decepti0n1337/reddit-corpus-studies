Why would you rely on a salty community for your "hype"?   
---

---
If you've been enjoying running around with your pals, just keep doing that.   
---
Subreddits for games are almost always filled with passionate, yet very hypercritical players.
---
---
---
Hope their marriage holds up better than this game.
---
I'm sure you've gotten enough replies by now, but I would like to add that subreddits are pretty much never the right place to go for hype about the game. I feel like more and more subreddits are getting toxic, and spending too long here also kills the hype for me
---
This is relatively rare for core/HoT mobs but pretty common with PoF mobs. This includes PoF mobs in core if you happen to be fighting mobs from the awaken invasion events. It doesn't even have to involve anyone trying to run away. You could  be fighting one in melee and be the only person around and they still do that.
---
Can you tell me a couple?  Would love to check them out tonight!  I'm an ultra newb so I feel like I'm unaware of 90% of the places I can go/things I can do.
---
It's faster to do the farm on the map in question. 
---
However, farming the map has an end point. Once you'd harvested all the nodes and done all the hearts, that's it for the day. No more unless you swap characters or wait for reset. 
---
Once you've capped out, you can then trade Eternal Ice instead of waiting a day.
---
Guardian has been part of the WvW meta since release. Engineer has come in and out. Right now either is a solid choice but Guardian is "safer" if you can only invest in 1 character.   
---
Minstals is expensive but once you get a set of Minstal ascended trinkets (Amulet, back, rings 2x, earrings 2x), you can use them for both characters. Once you get one of your characters going, you can use the [Triumphant Armor Reward Track](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_Armor_Reward_Track) to get a stat selectable exotic armor item to gear your scrapper.

Mobs used to heal rapidly once they leave combat and get leashed back to their spawn areas, but this functionality seems to have been replaced in PoF with invulnerability. I dislike the change, personally, and it has always been a bit... buggy (i.e. enemies with AoE attacks still able to damage me/apply condis while they're invulnerable).
---
I offer you a complementary "PICNIC"
---
Heh, I main chrono, so I thought that it's somehow connected with aggro drop when clones are shattered/phantasms change into clones. Good to know it happens... well, whenever it wants to - I see no rule now.
---
While the game may appear as one unit, it's more like a hodgepodge of many games put together. Sometimes things work in different ways in different maps, with different AI rules, different mechanics.  
---
All you may have learned about certain things in one map may be completely useless in another.  
---
Rather than an unified ocean of content, it's like patchwork.  
---
Because of this, different maps will have different rules that apply only there, and that invulnerability is the leashing mechanic for enemies in PoF maps.   
---
Enemies spawn either in specific spots or within a spawning area.  When they leave their designated area they will have a set distance they can walk before the leashing kicks in and they are forced to return.  
---
In most of the game they will break aggro and quickly regain health.  
---
In PoF maps, they instead go invulnerable and walk back without healing.   
---
This method is way better for boss objectives like champions since it prevents getting the boss healed in the blink of an eye, but it's extremely annoying for weaker enemies since it makes killing them take way longer than with the other leashing method.
---
Why didn't they set the invulnerability method for all bosses and the regen method for all other enemies across the whole game?   
---
Nobody knows. Anet's contempt for consistency and improving old content is inexplicable even for the most veteran and knowledgeable players.
---
&gt;NCSoft, to either talk to us or to let ANet talk to us a lot more.
---
Let's NOT begin this garbage that it's all NCSoft's fault again.
---
You legit have some severe problems and this has nothing to do with GW2's development. Seek help.
---
&gt;game is good as it is.
---
Another post of rose-tinted glasses.
---
&gt;  at the end of the "saga" we'll have enough content 
---
Companies like EA and Bethesda must love you if you think people should wait till the END to finally say "ok, there's enough content now".
---
I personally knew dev who was working in anet in 2015. He already knew that gw2 will get max 8 raid wings (it was already planned by game management) and not more and he told me it. Because I was asking him what's going to happen when they'll have 20 playable raid wings for example. How people will be able to clear it weekly. And he clearly told me 8 will be max. Because there's no point in adding more raids into this game. 8 playable raid wings which let you repeat them and make more and more legendary armors is enough for Anet. There's no point in doing new wing. It's better to focus on something brand new to bring more new players. This is why I never hyped about raids in this game.
---
I think everyone saying use /wiki and message of the day is misunderstanding what the OP is asking for. They want an in game calendar where you can see any guild's event that schedules it reguadless if you're in it or not. Basically like a in game way for guilds to say "hey we're doing this event on this day and time, come join us if you'd like". The Wiki can tell you when Triple Trouble happens, but you aren't going to be successful unless certain guilds are organizing it. If you're in the know, you know when to show up and look for the lfg. For people not in the know, it would help them join these events and help guilds if they're low on member attendance that day as well.
---
I play both.
---
Firebrand is almost always wanted.  Needed for stability, aegis, heal, minor condi cleanse, blast finisher (probably in that order?)
---
Scrapper is wanted until there's probably too many of them (and support tempest). Needed for condi cleanse, healing, sneak gyro, reveal (probably also in that order).  Arguably the best condi cleanse right now.
---
I always play FB on reset because it is always wanted and stability is really crucial in big fights. I use my scrapper for lower "responsibility" - it also sometime feel like a "win more" class (like cleans and heals help you guarantee win in clashes that you'll win anyway).
---
Suggestion: play firebrand. Would take a lot of changes for it's flavor of support to be un-needed.
---
I dropped off before HoT and feeling very overwhelmed trying to come back. Any advice?
---
Those aren't the only options though...
---
Guardian has power dps, condi dps, power support, condi support and pure healing variants that all perform extremely well. There are even core guardian builds that are reasonably effective, although less common.
---
What does radiance have to do with anything? I could understand if you were suggesting to slot a little less precision in favour of some extra vit, but you are talking about pure bunkers. 35% crit means nothing if you hit like a wet noodle. In a lot of cases anyway you're better off just getting prec from gear and running perfect inscriptions.

[It's one of my favorite areas in the game](https://i.imgur.com/O3SdZlV.jpg)! :&gt;
---
Anet needs to buy a lot of the player base some weed so they'll calm down.
---
Sometimes... I can - I'm not a robot ; - ;
---
If you're expecting automated moderation based on number of reports (which is a trash system)...yea...this is not the game for you; and if it ever becomes that way, it'll only kill the PvP community.
---
Reporting works and people get suspended and banned....but, just because you report someone, don't expect them to be actioned. That's idiotic for you to expect that. While bitter should be dealt with swiftly, there's a reason they wait before banning them in waves.
---
Just wait for the next wave to hit and then keep an eye out in Reddit. It becomes a clown fiesta of " call the whambulance...I was banned for no reason...I am innocent".
---
Do the story in order, though if you want to you can do the first bit of PoF until you get the mount. I was in the same boat and just did it in order starting from HoT.
---
Whenever abet releases any new major fashion, like a mount or a fancy new skin or something, suddenly people are returning
---
One of my favorite places in the game!  Sometimes when I’m not sure what to work on, I just go here.

Not really, no. But there are still plenty of trainings happening outside of these events. It's just that there were some 17 runs per day over the weekend, where a more normal cadence might be two to five trainings and a few clear runs (more experienced runs with an expectation to clear lead by community members rather than trainers).
---
So if you're interested in trying out raids: join the server. We'll be there to help you out.
---
its a good thing.
---
I like power tempest with wand, it's a standard build but it's very versatile and tons of AoE which is great for open world PvE.
---
Also Power Dragon hunter using greatsword and longbow. Longbow isn't optimal but I like being able to switch between ranged and melee options and the longbow moveset is much more fun than scepter/focus.
---
Elementalist/ Guardians in general are by far my favorite classes.

---
Sometimes the mob's leash is so short it aggros, then leashes back continuously... I don't know why.
---
He's presumably speaking about a couple of thread here from people who have returned which obviously means very little and is no indication whatsoever.
---
where did you read that there will be a tier 3 of the weapons? does this mean i should hold on to the exotics?
---
Auric Basin is easily my top rank GW2 maps : Design is not to hard and not to easy, the music is god like level, and panic meta is still the best meta.
---
that's exactly what I was thinking.
---
In my experience, it's actually faster to farm Bjora currency and convert. Doing the gathering route, opening the chests, doing the meta, doing the strike mission and a few group events will give you a stack in less than an hour, which translates to 100 of any LS4 currency. Then keep doing the gathering route on alts and you'll easily get a stack of LS4 currency in a couple hours.
---
Gathering 100 pieces of currency in their own maps, let alone a stack, is going to take a lot longer (even with hearts included). The gathering nodes don't have a 100% drop rate unlike Bjora nodes, and the events aren't nearly as generous.
---
Magneto?
---
I would agree but then change my kind immediately after seeing them pocket raptors stampeding xD
---
Uhhh, yeah ofc. That tends to happen when you have no loot progression in place. It's literally only for achievements/cosmetics/misc filler lore. With that said, since there's no loot progression, it should be arguably easier and therefore faster to develop new content. Which makes people (vets) upset why there isn't enough content, especially raids
---
Used to be used for key farming and shared slot
---
I have two questions but I'll put them in the same post because I'd hate to be a hog. Answer either one.
---
My ping (Australia) shot up from 240ish to 300ish the last few days, anything I can do?
---
Anyone have any vods of good druid players from their pov? Preferably in raids but I'll take anything. Also preferably pugging, rather than playing with other exceptional players or doing advanced strats, but I'll take anything.
---
My experiences are pretty much the same. Strikemissions got more activity in my raidguilds (which had emptied a LOT since w7) than capes in all my guilds and friendslist.
---
Its a sad fact that Anet just doesnt offer enough for veterans - and that includes returning players. Gemstore items and easymode bosses dont change that
---
Now, THIS is Podracing!
---
Nah this is bull. There are returning players every seasonal events god knows why. Little to do with capes actually. Fluctuates to ±600 tops usually. Mid season, half ditches the game as they find no one else to play with.
---
They simply do not have the tools, and it would probably take a fair bit of time and effort to develop them retroactively which they don't consider worth it. Sorry to hear that though. If you get a nice enough support member, they might Give you the shards back anyway, even though the skins have to stay unlocked.
---
OK boomer.
---
No one returned, just whores farming karma.

Your gaming on a Mac. 
---
Problem identified.
---
It’s not lost to you, but it also isn’t recommended. The boosts are much better for your second or third character. For your first, level like normal (it’s super quick), and learn the basics of the game. Soak it all in, and don’t rush. The core game has so much to offer, and a lot of people miss out on it when they rush to the expansions.
---
You can still do everything in the order you would like to
---
&gt; Which ones? I'd say ESO, SWTOR, BDO, Archeage, Tera. Yes.
---
Yeah. And realistically, what more should GW2 expect than to be competitive with a Star Wars and an Elder Scrolls MMO?
---
&gt;The only MMOs that distinguish themselves far above the rest are WoW and FFXIV they're both in a totally different league with WoW slightly ahead.
---
Yup.
---
&gt;Nobody said that you could ACCURATELY estimate the population based on twitch viewership. People are just talking about trends, not exact numbers as you claimed above.
---
Yeah, but if you then try to use those trends to advocate for *changes* to the game's approach, as some do, then those trends would need to be fairly strong correlations,  not just vague "more Twitch people *probably* means *some amount* more players than *less* viewers. . . maybe. . ."
---
&gt;But again, we're back at focusing on "twitch viewership" whereas it's better to look at the complete internet footprint of the game: google searches, twitter, reddit, youtube video created and watched (especially announcement trailers), forum activity,...
---
Perhaps. Twitch is the one that is specifically referenced fairly regularly around here as the "gold standard" of a the value of a game. I mean, the Whispers Youtube announce video has 128K views. I'm not sure if there were other ways to watch that or if that's the total amount. Just for reference, the last raid trailer only had 47K views, the War Eternal trailer had 119k views. It seems like the Icebrood videos are about on par with previous LW videos, but lower than expansion videos, likely due to lower attention from media outlets. What other data points are you aware of?
---
The woman who first came up with "ok boomer" must be cringing non stop these days from the sheer number of ppl who are too lazy to argue the merits of their (usually daft) opinions and use this panic button instead.

---
Works fine for me in PvE, and BossBattle works flawlessly too. Battle playlist kicks in in WvW too. Probably something broken on the PvP side.
---
Depends on what you enjoy. If you're an alt-aholic, snag character slots when they're on sale. If you need mules for storing stuff, bag slots are good. If you're into fashion wars, some of the outfits are cool and a nice thing to slap over characters while leveling them so you don't look like you got your armor from the rummage bin at Guild-Mart. If you gotta have a new hairstyle every month or custom colored eyes and better character creation options, the makeover kits are great. If you're a hoarder of stuff, bank tabs are always good, or inventory expansions (to raise the cap to 2,000).
---
Now, if you're talking about GW2 being a constant casual source of fun that you want to drop say, $30-50 a month on, then here's what I prioritized buying:
---
\-Home Portal stone (convenient home instance farming and since I mainly play Asura, an essentially free TP to Rata-Sum which is easy/fast to navigate for buying and selling stuff, crafting, etc.)
---
\-Recharging teleport to friend (this is incredibly useful for a quick jump to parties when you've just joined them - first person in the list is always the commander of the party you've joined).
---
\-World Boss Portal (I don't have to check what bosses are up, I just click and it gives me options and a free TP)
---
\-Maguma Portal thing (I don't recall the exact name, but basically the same thing for HOT map-metas)
---
\-One of the salvage kits (I prefer having all three, simply because copper is cheapest, silver gives the best chance of mats, and rune gives the best chance of rune components. I've found rune to be a decent compromise, since it nets me more rune components and those can be crafted into 2 to 5 gold items to sell.
---
\-Any of the permanent "crafting" or city portal scrolls that come up (i.e. the Royal Terrace in Divinity's Reach, the Mistlock Sanctuary, etc. for convenience.)
---
\-I maxed my shared inventory slots when they were on sale, because these are ideal places for the above, LS3 and LS4 books of portal scrolls, any city portal scrolls you choose to craft via the mystic forge, revive orbs/repair cannisters you snag through the monthly BL rewards chests, etc.
---
\-Watchwork miner's pick for the extra sprockets it drops. I also got some other gathering tools, turned gems into gold, and stuck the gathering glyphs on everything, so right now I have logging giving me unbound magic, harvesting giving me volatile magic, and mining giving me either sprockets or extra leather depending on whether I need mats or a slow extra income trickle. The magic glyphs are very much worth it, because you can easily accumulate a ton without thinking about it and get the things you want on those maps much easier.
---
\-If I find myself playing a particular character a ton, I max their bag slots when they're on sale and buy them a bunch of 18 slot bags (everything higher gets ridiculously expensive imho)
---
\-Alt character slots, because I enjoy playing the male asura in every class, have a few sylvaris, one norn, one human, one charr... I think I'm up to 21 characters now. (you can do personal stories up to level 60's and snag three free black lion keys out of it, do keyfarm if you enjoy that, play around with different professions and characters, etc.)
---
\-Slowly working up to full bank tabs right now; getting into crafting and deciding to do legendaries and ascended gear at every weight class of armor made this necessary.
---
\-Some of the outfit skins because they were discounted or I liked them for a character, same with the mount skins (I rarely buy mount skins tbh, but the fox/raptor was ADORABLE &lt;3)
---
YMMV on this, but I like having a full home instance, so I got the BL expedition boards for LS3, LS4, and Totems; the basic ore/tree/harvesting nodes, the basic cloth/leather racks, and then either saved or converted gold to get the other advanced nodes I was missing and the advanced cloth/leather racks. I bought the other two garden plots as well and use them to grow things I need or want to sell. It's not a staggering amount of gold, but it's five minutes a day to harvest and at least a gold worth of mats I don't have to buy or farm, so for me it's worth it. I'm working on adding LS3/LS4 nodes now, and added a lot of the old historical nodes from the laurels merchant. Again, YMMV on whether this is worth it to you - I enjoy it, and it's always nice to run other people through if someone's looking to farm.
---
I found upgrading the number of crafting licenses from 2 to 4 per character to be useful, but that's another YMMV thing - if you hate crafting, there's no point.
---
**Things that I would advise AGAINST spending gems on:**
---
Black Lion keys not in sets of other stuff (i.e. if I'm getting bag slots, skins, other stuff for the price, I'm okay with it, but straight up buying them is such a scam. There's a reason Belgium outlawed lootbox gambling... the drop rates are obscenely terrible and not worth it.)
---
Any repair canisters/revive orbs/bank/merchant/vendor express items, since regular log-ins will net you tons of these over time.
---
Any dye packs or canisters not in a bundle with other useful things. Seriously, 95% of those dyes are dirt cheap on the TP or can be gotten with a little patience from birthday gifts. RNG is not worth it there.
---
YMMV again, but build slots and template slots - at the risk of stirring angry discussions, let me just say that frankly, it is FAR cheaper and simpler to just have multiple characters and swap gear around than to get deep into these (and the limits of how many you can have may not be enough for some super hardcore raiders, etc.)
---
Any upgrades to your account when they're not on sale (bags/characters/bank slots/etc) because you can check the GW2 wiki and get a good idea of when they hit sales and when good ones are.
---
Hope this helps!
---
That's the one thing I'm missing from wow. A full on calendar that helps unite the guild, one place where you can plan events and happenings and have people sign up for them so they can try different things, do random dungeons or fractals or maybe have a go at raiding, do a little  bit of training or do something crazy and die in pvp but together. To bring a little life into the social side of the game. Would that tool be useful? Yeah Anet, duh!
---
At this point, I'm convinced that there was a magical dev at anet who did all the map connections in the game, but every other day, they were slapped in the face. Big ol' hand to the face. So they started coming in less and doing less work. Fewer and fewer maps received connections, even ones immediately touching each other. Eventually, that dev was slapped so hard, they simply ceased to exist. No more map connections for us. :(
---
Sunrise, the superior legendary greatsword.
---
Same situation for me. I stopped playing a few months after launch and came back last year. Been having fun!
---
Both are really good, so it comes down to your playstyle as well.
---
Firebrand is amazing overall, since with minstrel gear you are going to survive through most things, has great burst healing, dmg prevention, stability, aoe stunbreaks and kinda reasonable passive/sustained healing and condi cleanse.
---
Scrapper has probably the best passive healing and condi cleanse in the game, sneak gyro, superspeed, but i feel like it doesnt have as much sustain as fb, only has stability on bulwark gyro toolbelt, less stunbreaks.
---
While scrapper is very fun, i would say its better when you already have a fb in your group since the two builds complement each other very well, but on their own, fb is more crucial.
---
Also, scrapper doesnt really change traits, but with fb you can switch between virtues and valor, if thats something you enjoy.
---
Crafting the harrier insignias also saves you roughly 1 - 1.5 g per insignia, too.
---
Masteries are account unlocks, so no.
---
I meant more prestige rewards into hard content, not for open world.
---
No, mastery point unlocks are account wide
---
They should write the story so that it flows from one map to another and even add like a simple step that makes you go from the previous story map to the next instead of always going to Lion's Arch / Black Citadel etc. The Expansion story lines did this well, I'm not really sure why Living World / Saga can't do it too. Makes the world feel so much nicer if you can just go from one map to another. 
---
If there's a large geographical distance then I can undestand taking an Airship / Asura Gate etc. But for adjancent maps it seems lazy. They already know what the next map is and where it's going to be in the story as they usually are working on the next two episodes, so why aren't they incorporating the map making into the process.
---
Gw2 doesn't even belong to the "big 4" anymore
---
That's the aurene outfit with black dyes. It was given out to those who attended the event near PAX West that announced the saga.

The armor it flashes to is described by OP in another reply in this thread

---
A few more questions from a player considering returning to the game.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1. How does story questing in a group work? Is it like in old SWTOR content, where people make a dice roll for who talks? Can only one person talk and make the choices? Do they count for both players, or does every player need to have their conversations separately?
---
2. What would be the best way of making pixel money for a casual player? I don't mind spending an hour or two every two days or so farming mobs or mats, but anything more would be tedious.
---
3. Armor skins are single-use only?
---
To answer your question: The story quests will still be available in order at lvl 80 and the game will pester you to do it until you disable the notifications.
---
1. There's an instance owner and he is the one who makes the choices. If all players are at the same story step, it counts for progress. If for example player A is at the end boss of story chapter, and invites player B - but player B is only at the beginning of the chapter, progress will count only for player A.  
---
2. There's actually a lot of ways making some money without grind. There's a bunch of meta events that doing once a day can give you a decent reward. Also daily T4+CM fractals can net you 30-40 gold. Even doing one of the more 'grindy' ways for two hours is good enough (dragonfall run, silverwastes)  
---
3. Skin unlocks are account wide, you need transmutation charges to change skins for an armor piece but you get so many of them you shouldn't have a problem playing dress up.
---
You will obviously need to do that as a 10 mesmer squad... Any others group composition will be unacceptable. 😹
---
Just because everyone does it doesn't mean that it isn't bad
---
Thos business tactic is a consequence of capitalism because it's the framework that not only allows but encourages it.
---
Yep, with Anet being typical communist thugs they will silence unpopular opinions.
---
But before that spend thousands of dollars on a pc that can handle this graphics in 60fps
---
i gotta admit that HoT was beautiful and alive, season 3 had a similar but smaller effect, but PoF and season 4/5 have been static and dead in comparison
---
You probably got downvoted because it's not really a question. Why wouldn't they still work and why wouldn't they give the unlocks?
---
someone who wants to play a game doesn't want to hear anets and gw1 + gw2 vita to know if the game is for them. especially a streamer who runs a business himself has to think a bit more about himself then the game.  
---
...if its the end of his career, hes gonna think twice about streaming it.
---
Heart of Thorns were probably the best MMO experience that Guild Wars has ever had. It hit a great balance between difficult PvE zone exploration that was not impossible to solo if focused and also fun to go through as a group but also gave a great amount of large group meta's that are still popular to this day. Story was fairly compelling that had good stakes. Maps are dropdead gorgeous and packed full of interesting things to do. Adventures were varied. 
---
It didn't go without it issues but for the money I spent on that expansion I got hundreds hours of fun on my own and with friends.
---
Well, that should "fix" the issue for OP.
---
I mean, everything is there
---
* Kill proof Items
---
* Weekly clears
---
* Weekly History
---
Though I expect this to be only after registration on that site and it isn't what OP is specifically looking for with a direct and in-game representation of how much you know the content.
---
Would be great to get more than 3 unidentified gear after killing the hardest raid boss for the second time in a week.
---
HoT maps were by far the best open world and exploration experience I had in this game. Nothing after that has even come close to that amount of fun and replayability (except exploring Draconis Mons with the new mastery at the time).
---
Such a shame that they went this direction with PoF and LS4 (except Dragonfall, that was decent). I doubt they'll ever make a meta as good as Dragon's Stand again.
---
After reading this comment I'm kicking myself--I'm also playing FF14 where I had it the other way around, somehow when I switched to the new mouse I forgot and thought Guild Wars 2 was the same way.
---
you should go on the official gw2 forums. They've quite a "very strict moderation". I simply hope you only voice the correct opinion
---
Dude [seer armor](https://i.imgur.com/iOdPcSW.jpg).
---
I'm coming back to the game for the first time since 2013, having never played HoT, and the comments in this thread are getting me hyped.
---
I think the game's in a pretty poor state.
---
PvP and WvW are in maintenance mode. Alliances in 2021 is getting closer by the day. WvW's only content for like, 3 years, has been Warclaw. Raids and fractals are in maintenance mode; like dungeons, passed over in favor of the Shiny New Thing, strike missions (which take drastically less effort to develop, I'm sure). Even open-world content, supposedly ANet's strength, is not really progressing at a good pace. If they wanted to emulate LS2 they would've expanded the map by now.
---
To fix the PvE half of it, I think ANet needs to stop playing hide the sausage with its content delivery model. Do like the CCP does and actually stick to your five year plan, alternating between expansions and living seasons. Develop content that's robust enough that you don't need to live paycheck-to-paycheck with your content releases. Give us a fixed cadence for raids/fractals (and strike missions, I guess...). If ANet is fixated on changing to the Sagas model (which I think is a mistake) *show us the money* and put out the expansion features that people expect you to show them. Ya'll just gotta release one espec for us to take you seriously.
---
WvW needs a director with a good grasp on what the community wants and also the thick skin to ignore the WvW community when they moan about not getting what they want. I genuinely think the WvW community kinda dug this hole for itself but still it needs to be fixed. Also, either get Alliances out by March or shutter the feature and focus on something else entirely. Maybe you could kidnap some environment artists and have them make a new WvW map that'll see play consistently, rather than another Living World map that'll be ignored once all the rewards are earned?
---
I dunno what to do with sPvP.
---
As far as monetization goes, sell Supply Drops for PvE and Battlepasses for competitive. They're functional models and Battlepasses give players buy-in.
---
You know it really fits. HoT is a jungle, feels alive. PoF desert, is empty.
---
because you can't get them anymore and they are technically tied to PoF without bonuses now.
---
My crime was simply starting asking a question on a "discussion" forum actually dedicated to low effort memes and media dumps.  The only reason there weren't more downvotes is because I didn't offer a contrary opinion to the usual zerg hivemind, which would be a genuine discussion but that is not allowed on reddit.
---
For GW2, it would be awesome if it was game-wide calendars. So anyone could post an event on it either publicly or just to people in their friends list or guild (for example), and you could browse through and see "hey look, X is doing a Serpent's Ire on Friday evening" and sign yourself up. That way you would have a time and place to be and the person would know whether there is enough interest.
---
I actually now roam HoT with my skyscale. The flying is slow and I get to absorb the HoT beauty.
---
I completed HoT before mounts were announced so I had that experience also but now I'm enjoying it from a height.
---
I disagree hot made me quit the game while pof made me come back just because the open fields and horizontal landscapes. Season 4 stuck more to 1 theme than the almost randomness of season 3( don't get me wrong, I think season 3 but it lacked a clear theme in terms of maps)
---
Stop making yourself a victim. Noone hurt you.
---
im not surprised anymore
---
Humans making mistakes yeah normal
---
Design-wise it's a good choice to make a ztory content solo-able.
---
There may be times where completing the meta is impossible due to low player population. Imagine if killing both lieutenants in draconic mons was required to complete the story. Depending on your luck it may take days to complete.
---
&gt;We're bad at UTC, it seems.
---
Heh, americans.
---
How about just a flat 10g reward after clearing all wings, similar to dungeon frequenteer
---
I wrote dozens of post explain this.not bored enough now  to do it again
---
Any expansion content would have been burned in days . This is much better to me
---
since scrapper has been getting the nerf bat recently, see the "bug fix", i would say FB would probably be more fun. since, 1 button doesnt insta down you, and all that.
---
Or a tome that we can put all 3 tomes in
---
The problem is that it's become such a common occurrence. Every 2-3 games, someone's spouting racist comments or some other verbal abuse just because they are losing. I feel like I'd get banned for throwing reports before any other people get banned for racism.
---
That's perfect. Well see the the only other mmo I have played was eso and to my knowledge they don't have a level boost. So it was a grind on each character till level 50 after which you would be set to the highest cp toon you have.
---
That's kind of my expectation, that the report button doesn't actually do anything but make the reporter feel good about themselves. I come from League of Legends, I'm very familiar with ineffective reporting systems. League of Legends has numerous websites to track players accounts, and many players who should be banned for verbal abuse still play to this day.
---
I figured as much I really enjoy the story aspect of certain MMOs and I've herd alot of good things about this game. So didn't want to spoil it by boost leveling my toon.
---
Hell fucking no. Tangled Depths by itself is enough to make anyone go insane from map completion.
---
It's funny that it works in League of Legends but not here. I've started the game typing muteall without a / to make it sort of typo. For those who don't know, /muteall is a command in League of Legends that mutes all players including the enemy team. If you mute your own team before the game starts, its generally considered bad manners. Usually people would call you out, and be upset that you mute them for no reason because you just announced your intention, but I've won more games by typing muteall than I've won by starting the game with GLHF or something like that.
---
Welcome to the internet
---
But developers aren't humans though. But yeah I agree with you getting upset with human beings making a mistake is just idiotic.
---
This makes alot of sense I do really want to learn all aspects of the game. As I'm usually a solo player and really love the adventure aspect of open world MMOs I'd hate to miss out on cool thing and fights.
---
How you play the game is you, I'll play what I enjoy the most. It's definitely not what you stated for me.
---
all
---
eSports Ready!
---
The meta is the whole map. It is wonderful but too long
---
You know, if people could edit their messages and add a "jk bro dont do it" or something in PvP chat logs, it'd make a lot of the death threats and verbal abuse a lot more cheery. Maybe I wouldn't have to use the report button.
---
Sort of what I expected.
---
Unfortunately, you can't buy skill in PvP as easy as you can buy gold. That's why people resort to verbal abuse, they know they suck but they have to take the blame out on someone other than themselves.
---
? No you cant
---
Agree. My best memories are from HoT. With mounts people skip a lot of that "real" experience. 
---
HoT maps overall are beautiful and hard to complete (in the beginning at least), challenging enemies, lots of cool events - maguuma has everything. While PoF feels just empty and meaningless to me.
---
Cause players now think of end game and items.... If you play GW2 with a mindset of exploration rather than loots and gold, you'd appreciate it.
---
I have played this game for years, and I never knew that item even existed. I looked it up online, and it said you could buy it fro the trading post. I checked, and it's there on sale for 4100 gold. 
---
I don't know what's worse, that I never knew it existed, or that now I know it exists and will never be able to afford it.
---
OMG this deserver a nobel prize. TD is gonna be my new kid.
---
Hopefully, but it certainly doesn't seem that way. Before I used to think why people wouldn't PvP. With the amount of ragers and racists lately (or maybe it was always that way), I understand where they're coming from. In PvE people are so nice to each other while in PvP people are literally telling their teammates to die. What happened??
---
I'm guessing you are a veteran player who already pass by and know the game itself... But way back when hot came out. It was a fun exploration. And this also can be experienced by new players. Sadly most players suggest skip this and that. If you played Hot when it first came out and just explored the Hot map you would know the feeling what I meant. And even for me. I'll never experience it again cause I know the map and the game already.
---
It's like the feeling of a new raid for elite players. Finding out mechanics and figuring it out. And exploring. And Mount's kinda destroyed it. But I agree that Mount's did make traveling easier.
---
And when you inevitably get tired of right clicking on every material to deposit it, in your inventory there is a"settings" gear button in the upper right hand corner. Click on it, then click "deposit all materials" (it's something along those lines, I don't have the game open rn)
---
It will deposit every material in your inventory that isn't in a special bag/box.
---
I also recommend saving the 80 boost in your bank until your next character. Even though it takes a bit of time, I absolutely loved the experience of growing my character. And I got her to level 80 before the expansions, so no gliders or mounts to help. 
---
And if you haven't discovered it yet, certain game modes, vendors, and daily login gifts give you books of experience. I would actually recommend using those as you get them, some story missions go 5-10 levels between stories.
---
If the comments are targeted directly at you report them and they will be sanctioned. Never be afraid to use the report option when it comes to this.
---
If they are just random garbage that salty people throw out and you are offended by that turn on the profanity filter.
---
If that still doesnt do it for you use the new options added a week ago and turn off chat completely. You can turn it back on when you play other game types.
---
Usually Cm titles carry more weight
---
Yes, there will be more chances to get those dyes.
---
Getting 20 slot bags and saving to buy the Copper-fed salvage-o-matic gizmo is what I'd recommend.
---
shouldn't? Sure, but they will happen! There is no way around it and it doesn't matter if it is in a professional or personal or whatever environment. If it has to be verified by a human being you can be sure that sometime at some point a mistake will happen.
---
I mean, there shouldn't be people around that think the earth is flat, that vaccines cause autism and that there is a dude sitting in the sky judging your every move and yet those people exist. Even more serious issues can be explained and understood how it came to that, does this excuse the situation? No.
---
But most of the time other peoples mistakes are much more dramatic than the mistakes you do yourself.
---
I miss Lena... T\_T
---
True, and I am not even mad at them.
---
Even if I would care more this mistake is kinda whatever and the fact that they admit it went wrong and that they change it rather quickly is good too.
---
But it would probably be different in other circumstances and shouldn’t happen at all ( not saying that one person cannot do stuff wrong , but 3 ? )
---
Truly, exploring the jungle is bliss when you finally get what's happening. 
---
That said, I think I'd enjoy more exploring the jungle if there were a bit less mobs. The excitement from danger may be fun but it also can be extremely frustrating. Not only there's the risk of dying, but facing infinite+1 chaks is boring and makes me hop on my Skyscale.
---
Not me, no sir-e. 
---
(I mounted springer as I ported up to wyrm and jumped straight back down into the abyss), people saw...
---
You're Awesome !
---
You can only Get them per week. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Commendation 
---
Google is king when you want to know
---
I doubt they will jump from northern part of the world map to the southern part in such a small time. But yes, I would like to see Cantha. New map, new mobs etc.
---
Disagree. It's amazing to have a long meta instead of something you do in 5 minutes. Allows them to do so much more with it.
---
“Technically they were gonna kill Eggrene and we didn’t know it was Balthazar so it matters somehow”
---
“Yea we did get revived, but it’s explained so it’s not so bad”
---
“It’s not as bad if you know it will be poorly done”
---
The problem isn’t these things not being explained, the problem is that the story has been predictable, as you have stated yourself, and when it hints towards something interesting they can’t bring themselves to make the commander fuck ip
---
Is also very good for vision. For Vision of Istan you need 6 astral weapons. 1 weapon = 500 kralkatrite ore, so for 6 weaps you need 3000 ores. The hearts give you 75 ores a day (3 hearts, each 25 ores) so it would take a lot without the exchange (25 eternal ice + 2.5k karma for 25 kralkatrite ores). You can easly get 175 ores a day in less than 1 hour of play.
---
jk on you i play on a laptop and its a pp presentation that looks like minecraft
---
The commander fucked up many times, that is the reason we are at the point of the story.
---
IMO if ANet had stuck to human only, we could have had SO much more different armour combinations, a much tighter story, and a lower ongoing operating cost. Don’t need 5x voice actors for every single story drop. We might have even seen them stick to armour pieces instead of doing outfits too. 
---
Sigh.
---
2) Even gathering materials while doing your objectives will net you some money. I made my first 100g without even noticing it, by doing dailies (and discovering the world in the process) and just gathering what I found along the way.
---
Later on, you might be interested in crafting. Some timegated things do sell for decent gold, like ascended mats and Sktscale Treats. 
---
A few metas are fun (Silverwastes and Dragonfall) as long as you don't overdo them. I like the HoT ones (Octovine and Chak Gerent) and they give good rewards, but those only happen every 2 hours. World Bosses are frequent enough and there's always people to do them if you arrive early (so the map doesn't overflow), so you can try them if you get bored of traditional farming.
---
HoT was the most annoying map ever. it looked good sure, but getting around was a massive pain. are you sure you are not in an abusive relationship?
---
The GW2 Story is a sunday morning cartoon, what did you expect?
---
It's clear that game is created to make money, because developers won't work for free. Everything is for money, it's a business. They're making a product and they have to sell it.
---
I don't understand why people complain about the gemstore. If there will be no profit from Guild Wars 2, they will have to shut it down. Gemstore includes only cosmetic changes, not a premium account or items to win the game. Icebrood Saga is for **free** (at least for PoF owners and those who log in time to get it for free). You can get everything from gemstore without spending real money.
---
Anet is making money from selling PoF (includes HoT) and from people buying gems to get fancy skins or more gold (but remember, you can convert gold to gems).
---
Nah, sorry.
---
I love exploration and I've still been putting off the Tangled Depths stuff ever since HoT came out.
---
The layout means that getting anywhere from anywhere else is just a huge pain in the ass, if not effectively impossible, and the only solution is basically, "Oh it's really easy once you learn every but of how the map is laid out."
---
If anyone got actually fun build to try for pvp. 
---
Will be so cool
---
That clip is so funny
---
Contrary to your belief, these areas are WAY more populated than Crystal Desert! THere is ton of people doing hero points or meta. While I did HOT before POF and had just gliding and other masteries, I agree it was a pain to move from place to place, cause I actually had to think how to move/glide around to avoid damage lol
---
If you have raptor now, it's still fun to do. You want to move from place to place easily and jungle is a dangerous place (even when mobs attack you on waypoints ;)
---
Not sure think about POF. We rushed to get gripphon, we rushed to do map completion and so on and then there was nothing to do for very long time
---
Raid to me was an error so may raid addition to be is and was a provlem not additional content
---
&gt;while those who do not have it yet can only use the copter/airship from Black Citadel/Lion's Arch.
---
Yeah. They can block the portal to Lake Doric(?) in Divninity's Reach from people who don't have the relevant LW episode so it's not like they don't "have the tech".
---
You can get to Matriarch's Perch via Shrouded Ruins WP --&gt; Dust Dancer Plateau --&gt; up the vines --&gt; past the ( fire? ) wyvern, to the bouncy shroom that takes you to the airship with the mastery point in the jumping puzzle --&gt; Matriarch's Perch. From there, catch an updraft near the Vampire HP.
---
The sign is still there for Lake Doric if you don't have the relevant episode.
---
Hmm, I always thought of Dragon's Stand as the weak link of the HoT metas. Not a lot of nuance...just very straightforward move-and-fight with a few mini tasks thrown in...then everyone runs around in circles in a sea of mobs...then the island hopping which actually is pretty cool...but the whole thing just takes forever and 2/3 of it is (to me) just a boring grind. 
---
Plus the whole map is the meta. 
---
I wish that instead, they'd have made the map open except for the champ battle areas and islands. Have events scattered all over the map instead of along paths, and basically do a Silverwastes style of "fill the bar to trigger the meta", at which point there's an event at each vine wall to access the champs, then the three champs (but reworked...running in circles is the most unfun part of that meta), then Mordy.
---
I have more than 5000 hours and 2 real account with expansions plus 2 core ones . I finished everything doable this patch , I am just doing map completion with another character and fractals t4 waiting for wintersday. I do some wvw roaming for the daily. PvP is for afkrs.but still game is good It does not have to be a heavy play every week.
---
&gt;The At Scheuld
---
I felt like I was having a stroke.
---
Killing dragons without thinking, Eir's death, Aurene's "death", personal story mentor's death, crusader Apatia becoming a risen because we couldn't help her, commander literally died in a fight with Balthazar, which you said yourself and many, many more.
---
No, you're assuming that everyone thinks like you and it's obviously just not true.
---
Exploration-wise, for me HoT is *far* better now than it was when HoT released. The mobs are dialed down a notch so any trip through the jungle doesn't have to be a frantic scramble for survival where you never get time to admire the scenery. Further, now as a veteran with mounts, I'm actually able to navigate more freely and in a less limited way vs being constrained to the terrain of the map, so now I get to see things I never had the time, luxury, or convenience to experience when HoT first released.
---
I only played after the retune, and my build was 100% not ready for the pocket raptors. After unlocking Chronomancer, things went so much more smoothly.
---
ok.
---
I'm having the same problem, just checked right now at Grothmar Valley, no one around me - GW2 hovers between 69-77% CPU usage for me, which pushes my total CPU usage to 100% with the other stuff that I have going on in the background like Chrome, i.e. if i try to browse something, Chrome shoots up in usage to hit that cap.
---
If you aren't using kits already, you should begin. The sheer number of skills will bring much-needed utility and versatility. Even using only one will go a long way.
---
Only camping turrets may be safe, but it's quite lackluster in power. Your basic skills and autoattacks are either too lackluster or have too long cooldowns for elixirs, and gadgets have too long cooldowns to only use them.
---
Killing the monsters the game and plot has been about killing until Taimi pulled “Killing Dragons has consequences” out of her ass to give the game an illusion of depth. Remember that time we killed Zhaitan and Zojja said “this will have consequences”? No? That’s because it’s an unplanned addition meant to add depth, so your point doesn’t count as the commander did nothing wrong until the writers deemed it needed to be wrong.
---
Yes that one would make sense if Joko being angry had any consequences. Instead he just invites death to his doorstep snd kills those annoying politicians. Yea they deserve to die, how dare they arrest the plague infected Asura. Joko being angery is just used as a plot device to get him killed.
---
I don't consider living world seasons as missions pack, because living world needs a lot of ressources and isfree ( for current players ) 
---
Missions pack would use ressources already used, would be short and would focus on the story, not new mechanics
---
I‘d say sell it. 
---
There are way better dyes (that are more expensive) but use it for anything else. 
---
You will get more and more gold over time. Than you buy the dyes u like and get into fashionwars with nice skins :))
---
Who thought they wouldn't work? Why wouldn't they?
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
The downvoting is probably because these threads add nothing to the sub and/or are overly obvious details that people don't want to see showcased
---
People in MMO just want to obsessively collect things without interruption, that is why every game split PVP from PVE or make super easy maps full of things to get. I remember when you play for fun, not for a reward, and overcome a difficulty thing was rewarding enough. 
---
Nowadays people don't complains only about mobs difficulty, they want the easiest way to navigate, just a plain boring map with nice views with lots of fast travels or just an autowalk function to get from A to B without even collide with a rock or needs to turn. That is the difference to play for fun or for obsession. 
---
HOT map is fantastic, you truly feels like an explorer in a unknown and dangerous land.
---
once u unlock the mount is it available on all characters?
---
&gt;Dragons
---
Killing them was ok until the new writers deemed it not. I don’t remember Zojja calling us stupid for killing Zhaitan
---
&gt;Eir
---
0% the commanders fault
---
&gt;Aurene
---
Except she got revived because it was all planned as i said. Reading hard
---
&gt;Mentor
---
Oh yeah wish I didn’t keep that Zhaitan scout in my basement, oh wait we didn’t. Not our fault
---
&gt;Crusader 
---
Fair, that one is real
---
&gt;Except AGAIN we can’t  have consequences for ones actions, get revived
---
that doesn't make any sense
---
LW is too much content and not charging enough to count?
---
so what you're looking for is *less* content and you want to get charged for it?
---
Sounds like an awful idea to me. There's already not enough content going into the game, and you want them to wall some of it off behind a paywall? No thanks. Being nickled and dimed for every single thing just leaves a sour taste.
---
There is daily rng to it, all discs have identic chance to appear.
---
Just missing a grappling hook gun that can grapple and pull enemies or grapple and pull the engineer when used on terrain.
---
&gt; nickled and dimed
---
Yeeeaaaaah For me too not enough content going into the game &gt;.&gt;
---
and for me it's because everytime they do something, they don't make it chargeable for most players so why create content ?
---
im more interested on whether they found the friend they need. everybody needs a friend
---
&gt;a 0.000262% chance of happening.
---
If that's the number then it'll be that low no matter how may times you try it.
---
Other than the mount you could get the glider from HoT first chapter.
---
As for the scaling, it's not the mobs that scale but it's you who is scaled down when you go to any sub-80 area.
---
The advantage you can have with a high lvl char is that you have all traits and skills unlocked (except elite specs) and full exotic gear (even if the set that comes with the boost has quite bad stats), the difference is very noticeable in low level areas.
---
You're both going over the top in each direction.
---
Tangled Depths is fun IF you like exploration. I love exploration. Finished every map on GW2, some of time multiple times, especially the HoT ones. Tangled Depths is an awesome map because it really has dept. It made me angry when I was only going for fast progress in other things like mastery points. When I took the time to really explore and finish the map itself, it was so awesome. Its design is genius. 
---
It can be frustrating if you're just trying to go for something else and never took the time to really get to know the map. But it might be the best map in the while MMORPG genre, if you're all about really enjoying what it has to offer.
---
&gt; Ascended armor can be crafted, or dropped (rarely), not bought.
---
So this is your statement. I dont see that you mentioned anywere about WvW, PvP, raids or fractals. Not a word. So i added info that you can buy them from vendors with coins for from the game mode you play. How is this wrong? And how is your not telling this at all a better way to inform a person how is looking for ascended gear?
---
&gt; Killing them was ok until the new writers deemed it not. I don’t remember Zojja calling us stupid for killing Zhaitan 
---
I don't remember Zojja knowing anything about it, Taimi figured this shit out and definitely told us that we're fucked and it is literally the reason why we didn't killed Primordus/Jormag and were trying to find a way to kill Kralk without blowing up the planet for the whole PoF/living world season 4  
---
&gt; 0% the commanders fault 
---
We were a part of the team, she was a part of our team, more so we are the commander, we were leading all those people and her death was partly our fault and it's the reason why Braham was blaming us for it, it was the reason why he fucking hated us in season 3, did leave us, lead his people after Jormag and ultimately fucked up and oh look, the consequences of it we can literally see in the last episode.  
---
&gt; Except she got revived because it was all planned as i said. Reading hard 
---
Yeah, she was revived because it was foreshadowed by her consuming Joko's magic, which i didn't liked myself but it's okay, i guess, it was lame, but it was logically lame, but her death ultimately led to her growth and further reveal of actual kralkatorrik's motives and Glint's prophecy.  
---
&gt; Oh yeah wish I didn’t keep that Zhaitan scout in my basement, oh wait we didn’t. Not our fault 
---
Pact as a whole failed in a battle of Claw Island, so it was, again, to some degree also out fault and our mentor was protecting us.  
---
&gt; Balthazar 
---
Except we had consequences! Aurene came to help us because we almost died, but was taken as a battery for a Warbeast to kill Kralkatorrik. In the Domain of the Lost we saw Joko for the first time and found that he was tricked by a Balthazar and it was a foreshadowing that if we kill Balthazar, Joko will be free once again.  
---
Next time when you gonna shit on a story, please play though it yourself. Good luck, have fun.
---
And you can also get up via Faren's Flyer WP, up the vines like you're going to the golem HP, except jump off at the highest point of the vines and glide left to some big-ass updrafts.
---
I was just about to write that. I get that Bjora marches are really nice, but nothing is better than Tangled Depths. Luv it.
---
Everyone gets to re-experience that when Tangled Depths is apart of the daily!
---
Have you people NOT noticed the sudden increase of "i'm returning to the game! Mind giving me advice on X?" posts here?
---
Have you people also NOT noticed this increase in "i'm back!" threads ALWAYS happens during stupid or controversial moments?
---
Great work as always! Can't wait for the ls maps :P
---
Those should be fast and easy after TD :-D
---
After latest balance update something definitely changed. My client FPS is now lower and there is often micro-stuttering (tiny FPS fluctuations). Before update, my client ran smooth as butter (expect in big events). I mean real smooth, no hiccups, no loading twitches, no low FPS problems, no tearing, nothing. Perfect, smooth 60FPS with VSync. Now my FPS seems like a rollercoaster, it randomly fluctuates between 50-60, even when *nothing is happening*. Game is playable though, it was just really easy to the eye when it ran so smooth, like a dream.
---
I checked graphics settings, everything is exactly like before, but when observing in-game, I noticed increased amount of high-quality player models. Maybe a setting bug or a preset value change? I use "lower" on player models and their quality.
---
&gt;  ( not saying that one person cannot do stuff wrong , but 3 ? )
---
lets be realistic. a) time conversion sucks and b) they are americans... noe combine both and you'll get a disaster
---
well. this would end up in a total mess, with a dozens of events each day. and would also reduce the benefits of being in a guild even more.
---
Imagine that you actually need to do things first to be able to observe what it causes. So we killed dragons and then we were able to measure what it caused, and concensus what will happen if we continue changed. 
---
Have you ever thought why there was first unbound magic, then it was volatile magic all over the maps? Things get more out of hand and thus scientific predictions do change.
---
You are one toxic mofo
---
Try this in dota and you will get reported and will have a fun time in low priority matches..
---
Lol, are you trolling?
---
When I first played HoT, it all seemed a bit over whelming with the amount of things going on around me, the way the maps were laid, and how events changed the availability of their features seemed VERY disorienting. You could spend time trying to get to a point on the map, only to discovery you were on the wrong level, and trying to primarily solo some of the stuff like Hero Points was an absolute NIGHTMARE! There was a ton of stuff that was locked behind masteries, and some of the story sections forced you to grind to unlock particular ones to move on. I found the whole thing just sort of frustrating.  
---
Now I am playing through it on a second character, with my primary one all caught up on story, and this is such a treat to play. Coming in with a basic understanding of the lay of the land, all story required masteries completed, and a maxed out glider along with mounts, I am taking the time to slow down and better understand the meta events and complete the map achievements. I now understand why people like these maps as much as they do.

What initially seemed like chaos now makes a lot more sense. I get that the more difficult stuff works a lot better in squads and with a little bit of patience, there are always other players who need to complete the tasks you are after, so things like hero points are not anywhere near as difficult if you just wait a bit for one or two others to come collect them as well.  
---
I am really enjoying them a lot and my advice to anyone who struggles with them is basically they aren't really meant to be done solo. When you get to a new map, look up the wiki are read about the meta events so you understand what is going on at any given time. It REALLY helps a lot to understand the narrative flow of the events to enjoy these maps, and they make a LOT more sense when you bother to do that 2-5 minutes of homework. Also find squads when ever possible, but even just chasing the meta events will usually result in you being surrounded by other players. That makes a huge difference to the experience.
---
Thief has that!
---
&gt; Tangled Depths is fun IF you like exploration. I love exploration.
---
\&gt;looks at 8 map completions...
---
Okay buddy, whatever you say. I must hate exploration since I don't like the same maps as you.
---
It was hinted in something MANY considered an easter egg. Nice
---
And what did the invasion accomplish? Besides free loot and giving us an excuse to kill joko
---
It was a plot device
---
FB is strictly better by the numbers, but I have an easier time playing scrapper and seem to be more effective with it.
---
Yes
---
You can dismantle vision crystals
---
Going to get downvoted for this but oh well. Don't play ranger, you'll be much better off, more useful and get more tags playing scourge.
---
Exactly. In order for a fuck up to happen information must first be present. 
---
You can’t just make us kill a dragon and say “sike you can’t kill those”
---
“Have you noticed how the points became red points”
---
GW2 has always run terribly CPU usage wise. One of the 3 worse I've ever played. It's cause when the took the gw1 engine it didn't support a lot of the functions in GW2 so they had to do creative variable calculations instead of just being able to retrieve a value. And past attempts to fix the issues have led to game breaking issues elsewhere. Anyway rant aside.
---
Go task manager, right click the GW2, change cpu affinity to less cores. You will need to do this every time I task is recreated (program run). Make sure you don't go lower than 2 cores. Would recommend only removing one so you don't freeze. Also lower shadows &amp; lighting in the settings.
---
Rangers aren't really used in group zerg play, they don't really bring much to the table that other classes do a lot, lot better. You'll see rangers as roamers/gankers but for zergs not so much. 
---
Take a look at https://www.vabbi.eu/guide.html  to get some idea of what WvW classes suit your playstyle and look into running one of those instead :)
---
Eyy thanks for the tip! I appreciate it! Im definitely going to sell it once i can justify yhe 3 gold transaction fee lmfao
---
sweeet
---
I ended up in a similar situation today (for a different reason). Mining Bloodstone Crystal nodes in Bloodstone Fen nets a decent amount of bloodstone dust; granted, after about 2 and a half alts, nodes hit the daily cap and despawn, but still.
---
These are usually the best part of my month
---
Its good and bad .. on one hand is good because you can get all the currencies concentrated in one map only, but it takes players away from the already low population maps from previous seasons. If the acquisition of the currencies was designed in a good way, like in Bjora, we would not have the problem of farming those currencies on the respective maps.
---
Information must first be present fir a fuckup to happen. “SIKE THAT WAS THE WRONG CHOICE” isn’t a fuckup. It’s like playing portal without knowing you can pick up cubes.
---
That being said.
---
Dragon killing was a sike, not a fuck up, and it all turned out fine anyway, not because we did good, but because the commie attracts deus ex machinas
---
The commander didn’t lead anyone, Traherne did, HE fucked up. And Braham ONLY got mad when we didn’t let him kill Jormag, he wasn’t mad at us during hot.
---
Again, foreshadowing garbage writing doesn’t make it good. 0 consequences for fucking up
---
The mentor death was on the dipshit general or whatever he was and the game SPELLS IT OUT FOR YOU
---
Vlast was a 0 information sike
---
And no one got hurt after the balthazar fuckup. 0 consequences
---
Happens a lot to me, really annoying. Restarting the game fixes it for me.
---
I think the map ip has something to do with it, I've gotten the same combination of rooms for many days straight that its extremely unlikely to reset daily.
---
spaghetti code is spaghetti code. when you attempt to manually join it usually still works, which just makes it all the more confusing.
---
Juuuust give in to TD, this map is the best i can navigate through.
---
Airship cargo in VB has bloodstone dust, as do the TD crystallized supply caches.  
---
I think Jade farming in Lake Doric also gives dust
---
I dont think you need us to tell you what to do, expensive item you dont need? sell simple
---
Put 20 stacks on mule character, delete character.
---
I'm assuming the 3 mounts that you have are raptor, springer and skimmer. You can and should definitely use these in the HoT maps and they will not invalidate your exploring experience, since they'll be pretty much usable only on the ground level. The HoT maps have *so* much verticality that even the springer isn't going to help you much. You'll still have to figure out paths to reach the higher canopies and rely on gliding masteries.
---
Right Click -&gt; Destroy

---
Jesus Christ. How did you get that much in the first place?
---
To answer your question: Crash the ascended insignia/inscription markets (for insignias/inscriptions that aren't BoA, at least)?
---
anet gave first reason to do guild content since 4 years...  
---
  
---
and people already ask how to solo... single player fucking game man.. sad
---
weird flex, but ok
---
I know there are a lot of people who are in need of these items, sadly I can not gift them. Like stacks of luck, this is one of the items which keep on piling up for some people, and need an option to do something fun with it. 10 Stacks for a nice mini, why not?
---
do they really reroll daily though?
---
according to wiki, they change with instance / map ip.
---
i've completed all achievements and remember seeing the yellow room very rarely. the sauna however i had to visit every fucken day. my theory was that it had to do with very few people playing on the map, thus i'd very often get to the same map ip that never closes, thus i'd very often visit the same rooms.
---
Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb kit...
---
Maybe we could get a sink for this stuff in the future? It’s only real use we get is ascended crafting, a single guild hall decoration, and maybe a few legendary collections.
---
I mean, some exotics cheaper than rares in these days. Its not hard to get this much.
---
Yeah buddy I'm partly translating your pack (just using the tw\_aaa.xml file) to Turkish for my guild mates. As you know there are different names and seperators there. 1st I've realized that this file not being updated :) Then I've pasted the new rar to my extisting Taco folder and yeah. Heart of Thorns appers under the Collestions tab so :)
---
jesus christ this guy is actually complaining when people make music video's with game footage. Please tell me good sir how you buy/bought every single movie, song, game,what ever you have ever watched/listended/played in your entire life. Ass Hypocrite.
---
Be like me, believe in ANet to implement sinks for dark matter and balls of dark matter. In one day..
---
Do you play from your mobile phone 
---
?
---
I am writing from a mobile phone which does not even have engloah as t9 language so it keeps on autocorrect me to another word
---
So, you are telling me to grow up, right? Because games are for children, right?
---
Guild Wars 2 keeps my mind sane and keeps my mind relaxed and/or busy. Days won't be so boring to pass. Other games don't have same feeling. I love playing Guild Wars 2.
---
When you really enjoy something, what do you do with it? Throw it away? Quit? Divorce? Wrong, you keep it, take care of it, spend time with it and most importantly, you are *loyal* to it. Do you know what loyalty means?
---
You go seek help for not be able to enjoy things, instead you try to change them for your lifestyle, which is absolutely, utterly selfish. You are not the center of the universe. Let things flow and enjoy while you can.
---
Ah yes account bound materials. Wish they just removed the restriction.
---
Thanks!
---
You're misspelling words. You're losing letters. Having autocorrect is no excuse, you can turn it off. Helps a lot when you're writing in 3 different languages and add cursing and weeb shit into the mix :)
---
Also, I don't 'play,' I post from my phone. If I am able to type more or less properly, I think the same can be expected of others :3
---
Tell me about any mmo where every maps are always critical at the same time
---
Wow had to do cataclysm to make old maps relevant . 
---
Adding content relevant for two months is the only way to have content . When u have and expansion ppl move from a map to another as they burn content . 
---
And you have to be fast to be on same ma where other players are or you are left behind
---
Same as adding new content every two months. Forced timegate 
---
The new strike is a replacement to raid for casuals 
---
Gold or silver is pointless since the reward is just a few silver more or less. It is all content aimed to get the two cheat medium and small.
---
3rd one is completely pointless too much work for nothing
---
Gw2 mounts are the best mounts that also ruin the fun of the game
---
Well, that has not been the truth for anything but cof p1. 4warr and mesmer was meta only because of teleports and huge burst. Today you'd have one warr 1 power chrono and 3 dragonhunters or 2dh and 1slb. Meta changes, but you need some content to apply the meta to, a meta-event where it doesn't matter whether you do your rotation or afk with range aa is not going to cut it
---
Are you suggesting that for example, if I am on ip98 and get red-purple-blue, then come back the next day and if I am still on ip98, I should get red-purple-blue again? That's interesting, thank you.
---
Awesome! It was just yesterday I was poking around for any kind of update on this... what timing! Thank you for your hard work, and I can't wait to see the routes for LS releases. &lt;3
---
"Oh no I have no argument so I attac how u express una foreing language"
---
A whole new level of toxicity
---
I wouldn't worry about the population of other players in HoT maps, they are there for sure.  
---
Experiencing the maps will be different on mounts because they will allow you to circumvent the intended roadblocks to accessing certain areas, hero points, mastery points, etc., which would normally be gated behind leveling your masteries. For example, there are places in Auric Basin that you just cannot access without Nuhoch Wallows, Ley Line Gliding masteries, or a friendly mesmer portal, but mounts will give you immediate easy access. Waiting on your masteries will definitely make the whole thing feel more like a journey, if that's what you like, try without mounts. With mounts, the maps are still beautiful and probably much less frustrating, but you'll complete them and be out of there in no time unless you stay to level your (obsolete) jungle masteries anyway.
---
Its the same with spirit sharts tho, you can't really convert them into gold in larger quantities all that well, also you have to count in the time requirement into your profits.
---
Pretty much. A lot of the best healing spec’s are elite spec’s anyways. 
---
Use a DPS build to get through story content, etc, swap to a support build when it’s time for grouped content
---
Thanks! Guardian does sound more of my role!
---
Excellent! Thank you so much!
---
Who in gods name would ever downvote this post, why does the majority of posts in r/guildwars2 show lots of posts on 0.
---
I for one are in favour of this and would love anet to add this as a QOL change
---
This sounds like a feature that would take around 3 years to develop, so better start upvoting now!
---
You do spawn right there.  They probably had better things to convey. I had no problem finding this when looking around and was quite surprised to learn that this was even an issue worth complaining about for other players. It makes sense not to have a direct connection because the pass is meant to be frozen solid,  no? That's said,  I'm not expecting agreement from you. I'm just amazed how you think they should include a list of map connections with their update.
---
but it's not a fast profit, you need spend some extra materials and then sell those items to get the profit. And the most desired insignia/inscription combinations are accountbound due to requiring expansions, so you can't sell those.
---
What i mean is, OP is probably getting globs at a much faster rate than what he would be able to sell them for profit.
---
It's the same as lets say spirit shards, but at least those are a currency and don't take space in your inventory.
---
&gt;  I will just point out that all or nothing released on January 8th 2018.
---
iirc, anet pushed the release date of all or nothing from december to january because they didnt want to release it right before going on holiday break.
---
boomer
---
No joke: Portaling through a jumping puzzle is a common strategy on the final boss of wing 6.
---
sadly for many exotics it's more profitable to just salvage them for materials than selling them in TP.
---
I'm mostly looking forward to it. GW2 story isn't stellar - sometimes not even well-paced - but absolutely entertaining enough for me to want to see where it goes. If you want a really great story, you'll find it in games like SWTOR or TSWL.
---
ESO has great writers and more diligent storytelling, but what actually happens isn't more exciting than what happens in GW2, and visually not as well presented.
---
Woohoo! Content!
---
I’m just sitting here thinking, damn, the second to last episode of last season was almost a YEAR ago. Lol
---
they won't do it as long as those stats are tied to having purchased the game (they don't want free accounts to have access to them).
---
piss off with passive agressive bullshit drama posts.
---
Either run multiple sets or multiple characters. GW2 is very alt-friendly. 
---
For example, as a raider you might have a Condi DPS character, a Power DPS character, and a Support character, so you can fill multiple roles depending on what is needed, and all that is required is a character swap.
---
I’m a long time raider and I have like 7 characters who are all geared for raiding
---
Looks like Karmafarms back on the menu, boys!
---
First of all, you're wrong. Meta is not just decided. Meta is theorycrafted and calculated. There is a good reason why gs/sword+axe slb is better than core ranger longbow 1400 range. It's damage. It's cc, it's utility.
---
People don't see meta as something concrete. People don't mind seeing an slb that goes stanceshare or qfb who goes one utility skill instead of spirit sword. It's just a casual idea of how hc people are, even though it's not because of all of those things, it's not because we inpected your build or because we didn't like your armor colors. This idea that people blindly follow meta comes from the fact that casuals came with dumb builds, would not provide utility they were expected to provide and ended up doing not ~80% of the benchmark (because, again, you don't need to play roughly at the benchmark, it's combat where you have to dodge and do mechanics) but 2k dmg with your 'custom build with other valuable qualities other than damage.'
---
You wouldn't enter a mosque without taking your shoes off. You would abide to certain rules no matter your beliefs, because that's the correct thing to do. Yet ingame you are just joining parties that explicitly search for someone who plays meta, and then cry you were kicked out for very sub optimal performance.
---
And, finally, we rarely care if  a run is one minute longer. But we do care when we do skovald and you deal 50% of the damage the next dps player deals. Because if you deal so little damage we get into a shit situation in which he, instead of standing still and getting bursted, starts to deal insane damage and risks a wipe. We don't care if you're dh or dd or power chrono as long as you don't fuck up your opening and then keep up more or less good dps. The thing is that a scrapper won't be able to keep up with a dragonhunter, which you don't want to admit.
---
you still have these 20 paths. the lie they are not profitable is just that. a lie.
---
Cool that they can admit to a mistake
---
Wait what?! Is that new content I spy? Wasn't expecting that!
---
I am pretty positive u can split a text in different blocks to make It readable.
---
Pretty late this year, but happy to see wintersday come back!
---
I fully agree! And to me personally, HoT came at a perfect time. I was up to date with the story and Living World stuff, was starting to get into fractals and dungeons, and I was getting really invested in the game. The hype was real after the HoT announcement, and the idea of elite specs got me super excited! When HoT came out, a lot things just went really well together. Hype and my excitement for the game, the amazing maps, the meta events, the experience grind for masteries that gave a sense of progression, elite specs letting you experience the game from whole new perspective, new legendaries to work for, and raids coming out later. 
---
There were a lot of factors that made HoT a great experience for me, and I really miss those times..
---
Is it always starting this late? If it's ending early January as usual, I almost won't get to play Wintersday, due to visiting family during the holidays :(
---
I'm sorry, I'm used to devoting one block of text to one thought. Will try to make it more readable from now on.
---
Still waiting for Dragonstand 2.0
---
&gt;So, you are telling me to grow up, right? Because games are for children, right?
---
Right there, you prove that you DO need some severe help.
---
Worse. 
---
Im going to give them useless presents. 
---
EVERY. 
---
DAY.
---
Haven't played the game in a long while, but I do remember how the classes and roles work
---
To start, all the classes are able to fulfill each role in GW2's "Holy Trinity" of Damage, Support, and Control; there is no dedicated support class and especially no healers. Some classes are better at certain roles than others, but a Support Warrior is as viable as a Water-specced Elementalist, which would be the closest thing to a dedicated healer in GW2
---
As for how Supports work, their primary focus is to provide buffs and use abilities to increase the effectiveness of the group, such as laying down combos (ex. Creating a wall of fire for the ranged DPS' projectiles to apply a burning debuff). Healing is still a duty of the Support, but it's not their main and only concern, especially as every class has a self-healing ability and a dodge ability. Nor is it done simply by targeting an ally refilling their healthpool: for the most part, they apply the "Regeneration" buff, apply other defensive buffs, and revive downed/defeated allies (which is the equivalent of rezzing in GW2, but not restricted to certain classes: just click the down ally and you'll start pulling them up) 
---
The intent by the devs was to make the Support role proactive, rather than the mostly reactive playstyle the healer role promotes. An effective Support in GW2 is one who supports their allies before they take damage, with healing only really being important when you start losing 
---
Hope this helps ^_^;
---
What does highlighted letter "A E Y E RY" mean?
---
&gt; I meant more prestige rewards into hard content, not for open world.
---
Then what rewards do you believe will get the non-players going "Hot damn! Sign me up for Deimos!"
---
I see none new from last year other than skins
---
Oh. Wintersday live?
---
Was just copying your comment on mines split in more than one
---
Ugly sweater season!
---
Nice, sweaters! First we get a normal shirt with Grothmar, then capes last week, and now sweaters next week? Man anet is on fire with finally adding new and requested forms of clothing
---
We heard the same shit about build templates and when they came with ridiculous pay walls people got angry. Anet got enough money to shit out content, they just need to get their shit together.
---
Keep the money coming!
---
I genuely did not understand what you wanted to say.
---
Endgame is not raid to me. They should remove raid as a whole.
---
I used wow as example cause with cataclysm the modified every single maps and made them relevant again.
---
But u never played so u could not know what it meant to move back to. A destroyed barrens for example
---
The lair is not new.
---
Looks like a slightly altered version of the [corsair jerkin light armor](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dulfy.net/uploads/2018/06/gw2-long-live-the-lich-achievements-guide-57.jpg)
---
Yeah. They need to make an use for all that dark energy and dark matter.
---
Looking at the "PvP mode" of the equipment loadouts, that new interface to switch between amulets and PvP upgrades could be used as a way to switch stats in legendary gear.  
---
And they could also add a way to unlock stats for types of gear. Like "salvage ascended berserker sword-&gt; Now you can apply berserker stats to other swords".  
---
Then they could make dark matter and dark energy salvageable to give a new material or currency, and then let platyers use the new material or currency to pay for the stat changes instead using the awkward mystic forge recipe.   
---
There would be the upfront cost to salvage a piece of ascended gear for each combination of stat and type of gear, but the switch would be doable anywhere without having to carry materials and a mystic forge node. 
---
Then all those exotics getting under 50 silver and the account bound materials salvaged from them could have some more use.
---
And they nailed it.
---
It seems to be a slightly modified version of the [corsair jerkin light armor](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dulfy.net/uploads/2018/06/gw2-long-live-the-lich-achievements-guide-57.jpg)
---
keep your drama post coming!
---
Dec 17
---
Why should they remove raids? Shouldn't there be more content like that, so that everyone, even the dreaded toxic elitists, can play at their own pace?
---
No, it's repeat content...but it's content.
---
To the devs: Consider turning the lair of the snowman into a strike mission? Somewhere?
---
I'm surprised this is even a feature in the game. How did you discover it? 
---
I have just watched a video and it feels weird to see a player following a constant path. Definitely cool though!
---
it's hard because as a pvp/wvw player, once i tried and mastered combat in this game, going back to pve sucks big time
---
mobs are really dumb in this game, most of the times you die against pve is because you got hammer by lots of aoe at the same time, or you just crossed an elite around a corner and he one shots you
---
most bosses are so repetitive and boring, just huge damage sponges worth nothing
---
even rewards suck, i've done dragon stand hundreds of times just to get nothing but the regular 3/5 gold 
---
same with fractals, dungeons, world bosses, and most elites around
---
don't get me wrong, pvp/wvw rewards also suck but at least i have fun fighting over those modes
---
It's easy, all you need to do is get to Lion's Arch with any character and be in a party with me, rest is basically me carrying you through the mission. PM me your in-game name or character name!
---
I am not sure what to play, I have crafted and boosted most classes to 80, so I have never really played through the game, but I recently thought I'd finally do it, not sure what to play tho, only "new stuff" I've played is daredevil and druid, but I'd like a class that is very good in both pve openworl/raid and wvw pred a class that poss can heal or tank+dps
---
It's not in the game it's 3rd party app:-)
---
It looks like it was supposed to be alternating blue and red letters, but someone forgot to change the y.
---
Im actually out of the loop for streamers that play power herald specifically, I use to play Spvp competitively myself, but I mostly play WvW roaming now instead of pvp. Sorry I couldn't help further there.
---
VR MR
---
Virtual Reality
---
Merge Request
---
ANet is adding VR support to GW2.
---
It could just be alternating colours because of the Christmas theme, but I feel like the VR theory is simpler and more likely.
---
It's not about "A E Y E RY", it's about "V R M R WintersDay" /s
---
keep white knighting!
---
Havent got into wvw yet. A full zerker exotic gear should be enough? Also do i need guild or something, or i can just start playing it?
---
It's the other way around. VRMR, those are sonsonants from **V**o**rm**i**r.** 
---
Disney secretly bought ANet and we'r getting cross-over with Avengers.
---
Yep, and probably nothing else... seems like this is it for seasonal festival content.. I expect Dragon Bash to get a few more rewards next year and then festivals will probably go into automated maintenance mode...
---
The game has no subscription fee and new content is developed and released several times a year. Why is it so sad that there are lots of skins available in the gem store?
---
Mounts are a mastery tho.
---
3 weeks so yeah.
---
&gt;The majority of the GW2 player-base *are* casual, story-driven and achievement focused players that are happy to cough up $$$
---
Okay...
---
&gt; They're happy to enjoy the attractions at the GW2 theme park ~~(at everyone else's expense)~~
---
Wait what?
---
I really love how the people sending ANet money are, in some twisted way, seen as doing *anything* in this game "at everyone else's expense".
---
If you want to talk income, the GW2 player base is receiving exactly what they're asking for with their wallets: cosmetics, gem store items, and minor QoL improvements scattered across a light but consistent story release schedule.
---
*If anything*, if you want to talk about a demographic within the base enjoying the game at anyone else's expense, it should be exactly the opposite: competitive mode and hard core demographics spend comparatively little real world currency on the game yet still enjoy their subscription free gaming as long as they like. Though that lens, they're enjoying the game at the expense of the gem whales.
---
Maybe if the competitive and hard core demographics generated more income, they'd see more releases tailored to them. Not saying they should start flinging money ANet's way, but I think it's totally unfair to characterize gem buyers as somehow leeching off of the rest of the player base for ANet's attention and productivity.
---
Looks like there is no new version. You uploaded it with the same name and version number?
---
I suggest the same to you
---
Anything new?
---
for every item introduced, i guess it adds up.  
---
on the other hand buying a shitton of accounts probably still gets you farther if you want to pay to win the game.
---
Lol, is not too hard to implement, is a plain board like a diary, indeed if for them is not a priority wil ltake eons, but hope i'm wrong and they consider it in the next patches. :D
---
Zojjas is decently quick to sell, but the least profit
---
What's the bottom right item in your inventory?
---
Lair was from last year introducing freezy mini raid, now called a strike.
---
A shame we can't trade this on the AH.
---
Yeah it really surprised me that they seem to work. Every halfway competent player should notice the rip off immediately...
---
... Oh.
---
There has always been a problem when it comes to the RP scene (At least in EU) and that problem is that nobody really wants to initiate public roleplay. When PoF was released there was a guild in one PoF zone. But this guild was full of toxicity and other problems I won't get into. The complaint I often heard from friends was that there was no roleplay elsewhere. Though I also noticed that nobody really wanted to start something either. There have been situations where I would grab a friend, roleplay in Divinitys reach and some others would come and join over time. If you want public roleplay, the best thing to do is just grab a friend and start something. Get the ball rolling in a sense. I'd say this won't work every time but it's still a good start.
---
yep
---
It's been blood since day one. No need to check. It never changes.
---
Even when totems spiked because people didn't check the multiple recipes for curios, blood was still better.
---
Looks like they imitate node drops. That'll mean gemstones too, since they drop from trees and ores.
---
Reddit is not a traditional discussion forum and certainly not one for mundane questions. For that there is a weekly [megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e7e3mk/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_december_07/)
---
Disney buying Anet wouldn't be that bad given current state of affairs tbh.
---
Prepare for that gemshop though
---
they're a player looking to start doing wvw, they won't have the knowledge or skill required to play ranger at a level where one could possibly even begin to be considered useful in a zerg setting. It would be much better in the long term for them if they played a class like scourge that's relatively simple and isn't responsible for anything other than doing damage where they can just focus on learning the basics, positioning, when to drop damage, when to play safe or be aggressive, ect, while still being effective since the class is easy to play to a level that is effective. They will have a much harder time learning this on ranger if they manage to learn it at all. The only bad recommendation here is telling them to play it anyway when that will just lead to them getting bitched at for playing a ranger if things are going south and people get frustrated with those not on good classes and also not learning the things that they should be focusing on first that will help them in the future. Encouraging them to play ranger when its just straight up not good at all outside of a few niche instances in zergs that can be filled by other classes which are also useful outside of those niches is just setting them up for failure and I refuse to sugar coat how bad the class is for this just to save someones feelings about how/what they want to play.
---
No guild required. You can enter with exotic gear...
---
what stuff are you talking about?
---
new maps you can finish in 2 hours? with no replayability?
---
a "new game mode" which consist of recycling every other world boss mechanic and narrowing it into a smaller room with limited teams
---
skins and skins and more skins for the gem store?
---
bland "qol" stuff like templates which broke the entire game during weeks?
---
i'd prefer if they add none of that crap and fix what is already broken like class balance or neglected game modes
---
Just be aware that there is something called [Recovered Black Lion Goods](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Recovered_Black_Lion_Goods) that you can get from buying [Knife Tail Gang Hunting Bonds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Knife_Tail_Gang_Hunting_Bond). As you can see these recovered goods contain a huge amount of premium skins and also a lot of dyes. You want to unlock all the dyes before opening this box in order to get an exclusive skin instead.
---
Heh. Actually that one isn't toooooo hard on my ears. I was in a WvW pug the other day, with female sylvari comm. So I'm across the damn map after waypointing and I keep hearing
---
#On my mark, attack!
---
And it's like hey lady I can't see shit what are you yelling at me for

Wintersday 2019: Nothing New Edition?
---
Content exclude when u Need to follow a meta not for a second more or less but just to do it. Content exclude ppl when the  kills are used as proof to do even different content .
---
Kill in raid are used to exclude in fractal too. This is so plain wrong .
---
Oh the whole point is this is a game not a work. But tx God game is moving towards casuals . Strike will replace raid and we will all be happy
---
Raid 5 - Underworld was hinted with Living Story during Halloween when it came out. Might still have some Jormag stuff tucked away. Also remember how everyone was (*&amp;#$ing that we didn't get the Griffon like the PoF leaks said we should have?
---
key farmer as u delete it
---
I used work alegory because it was the first thing I thought of. I can ask you a different question, why do you refuse to be good at your hobbies?
---
I'm not a gamer, but I received two of [these promo codes](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/get-an-icebrood-saga-heros-bundle-at-quiznos/) from Quizno's. Does anyone have use for these? I'll happily give them to the first two people who want them.
---
I think this sounds awesome if it was used well, but I don't know how you would stop it from getting spammed into oblivion.
---
With gear and equipment templates you can swap between damage and support with the press of two buttons.
---
I have an i5-4690k and i have the same issues as well. I tried looking up the reason for it but its apparently a common thing for that cpu.
---
I recall there were vg kills done by people in masterwork gear. You can do it. It's just that there are just about as many people who can do it as billionaires. Ofc taking scale into consideration. Meta just makes it way easier. Raids never were supposed to be easy, they were supposed to be a challenge. A challenge that is way harder (but still possible) in masterwork gear.
---
Things like vistas and exploration - even the "boring" stuff like distance, it's all ruined with mounts. You don't get to experience Tyria like it was meant to be experienced. For the longest time, the devs outright declared that mounts would never be a part of GW2 for that specific reason. It would ruin the game.
---
Things are different in new maps because they're designed differently, but not in the original game. You're meant to walk across Tyria. It's so much more vast on foot. The players who insist you get a mount are the players who want you to skip the best part of the game just to get to the point where you can grind for no reason whatsoever. You ruined the experience for yourself. You skipped the game.
---
It was developed by an intern.
---
Sure, drop me a dm
---
Mid December to Early January is the typical time for Wintersday because, well, the holidays.
---
The new map cannot be completed on two hours if u have to do all the achievements . Stop
---
I think the challenge comes from the networked side of and the systems that would need to be designed to stop spam and over-crowding of it.
---
Dragon Bash already hinted to Icebrood Saga. So I wouldn't expect additional hints, given nothing changed for Festival of the Four Winds or Halloween.
---
At the very basic minimum, yeah.
---
Also, we still don't have a connection in Orr.
---
well the thing is, it is an awesome qol, but people will most likely miss so many thing when they have the raptor, because they simply wont take their time to walk around and exploe, instead they will just run from one point to another and skip all the beautiful things that make and rpg and rpg :(
---
Before HoT I didn't really pay attention to my playing skill or my build because I didn't need to. HoT really changed the game for me.
---
IMO mirage is the most hectic and twitchy class in GW2. I'm frantically pressing all the buttons and still my DPS output is below any other class I play.
---
I love power chrono as a very relaxed open world farming build, and of course boon chrono to easily get into raid groups. Gear up your mesmer for the specific role you want to play and stick with it.
---
Be prepared to get frequently exploded with zerker gear. Marauders is much more effective in world vs. world almost always. Survivability is really important there because the damage output of a group of players is immense. People often run defensive food, as well.
---
What ? 
---
You can buy something remotely useful with those things ?
---
It is not a matter of being good or bad
---
Let me explain with a different game.
---
Witcher3. Is just about minmaxing and killing stuff as fast as possible or just enjoy the story and the world exploration ?
---
Is gw2 is not about doing a kill in zero time. It is just a way of playing but u can be as good and enjoy it if u decide to play as a healing engineer.
---
If u do not run fast as bolt are u a terrible jogger ? Or are you just having fun relaxing running under the trees ?
---
That is the whole point : a hobby do not require you to be the best just to relax and have fun.
---
This is the reason why u do not enjoy the game
---
There's a couple of annoying spots even between the HoT maps. It's really aggravating.
---
Ok mate, keep on living in 2008.
---
Still none will be taken in group without ascended gear nowadays. And that add was just another error long ago but let's say it is ok now
---
.
---
I feel like this video showed absolutely nothing. Normally these videos provide some promotional content, maybe some words, this is almost catering to people who have played wintersday for years and pretending other players don't exist.
---
Lovely &lt;3
---
That statement is not contentious, and rewards are available through gameplay. But my interpretation of your previous comment was: "All rewards are not available through gameplay? That's sad." It just so happens that glider skins and mount skins generally are not earnable in game, but every free content update comes with earnable rewards. Sometimes these are significant, like roller beetle and skyscale, both part of LW season 4. At the same time, LW4 gave us multiple earnable armor sets. These are parts of free DLC updates, not the base game or paid expansions, so that's my definition of free. The fact that you bought lots of QoL stuff doesn't make free content paid content, not sure if that was your point with that statement.  
---
I agree about a subscription model.

---
Oh, then I am going to have a very disappointed guildmate. He was sure it started today. 
---
And I can't click link from where I am. Reddit is not blocked, but game sites are. So kindly take your attitude and fuck off.
---
I doubt they made it intentionally for you to have to search different IPs, they probably just assumed the map would be busy enough for you to be placed in differing shards as the map was/is busy and had many different ones.
---
It's complicated. Basically all healers are shit at certain parts of the game. Druid is a must have in raids, but is shit in fractals and wvw. Scourge is good in raids and shit everywhere else. Renegade is... Acceptable, but it's an offhealer that assumes his team does not consist of 4/9 piles of bricks.
---
Firebrand is a good healer in both raids and fractals. In general I'd say go for firebrand, if you main guardian you have good builds for power dps, condi dps, and healing
---
what the hell??
---
is that an ugly Christmas sweater i see
---
GW1 got one new hat every festival every year ffs. chill out.
---
Thanks, guess it is Rev?!
---
It's not like the whole games economy AND prestige/fashion is based around map completion right?
---
Hopefully it will last longer too.
---
Well I know what I’M wearing when we kick Jormag’s ass
---
Get into your world's WvW guild and run the WvW missions. Very low effort commendations.
---
If you have one account.
---
So, will there be a new infusion this year?
---
In the logo, why are the R and Y both red in the word "Merry" ?
---
Yes, it's my favorite special event!
---
&gt; No, I'm not sorry that my words hurt your feelings.
---
http://www.gw2taco.com/
---
With the right items it should be pretty easy to buy and salvage for a profit or at least break even.
---
The mad man actually did it! Hats off to you.
---
Yet again you cant pay to win. You can pay someone to carry your lazy ass but that's true in almost any game. You cannot pay Anet to give you a free invulnerability pass to raids, where you cant die, passing a raid is skill based, not item based. PvP is 100% skill based, you cannot pay Anet or anyone for an extra 400 dps as a straight up buff. It's you and your team vs theirs. You have the same gear choice, stat choice, build choice etc as someone who's bought literally everything on the gem store vs someone who hasnt spent a cent in gems, the only deciding factor is the expansions and even then there are some very strong core builds. You cant pay Anet to pass CMs can you? Get some ess? Can you pay Anet to buff your dps output? How about a straight up damage reduction? How about health per second healing? Periods of invulnerability? Can you buy one item in the gemstore that improves your survivability, increases your DPS, or does anything to improve your chances of clearing a raid, CM fractals, WvW, PvP etc.? Yes you can buy gold which you can pay on a unaffiliated market to have someone carry you, I'm talking about you buying an item that let's you skip or basically cheese a boss, PvP matchup, WvW etc.
---
There was a strike last year, it was the entire basis for them coming up with the term "strike mission".
---
Careful using the word "meta". Firebrand is not the meta healer for raid encounters. Viable? Definitely. Not meta.
---
:-P
---
Alright, the little Ho-ho-Tron animation was cute. Can't wait for a dyeable Replica Ho-ho-Tron backpack skin XD........I'm the 1% probably
---
ok
---
It is not in fractals neither. It is just favored by pugs
---
I mean you can already buy gems and convert to gold and get more out of that than from this thing.
---
Gold just doesn't really translate to power in this game so the only thing you can "win" by paying is fashion wars.
---
Yeah you haven't played in a long time, a lot of this hasn't been true since launch, or at least since Heart of Thorns with elite specs and raids.
---
"But... I got wooden swords from like 3974 other players today..."
---
You can read. Shocking!
---
Not what I was expecting from your previous responses.
---
Wrong.
---
Tradingpost
---
Too many clicks, profit not high enough.
---
Perhaps they colored both the spaces red
---
This is a good idea. I will try next weekend to find some people who need my help.
---
The VR in ''a VeRy MeRry'' is probably giving a false hint haha
---
&gt; OP is probably getting globs at a much faster rate than what he would be able to sell them for profit.
---
Bullshit. There are 15+ different recipes for ascended insignia/incriptions that will each net you 1g/glob or more doing instant sells on the TP. Everything needed for those recipes is easily available from the TP, so the total time investment is a couple of minutes.
---
True, as someone else suggested. I just use a keyfarmer for mass deletion.
---
Uh, Draconis Mons Mastery but-as-a-utility.
---
&gt; And not many crazy expensive gemstore exclusives, either!
---
That's for next week. :)
---
My least favorite is probably the Luminescent armor skin collections that require completion of the LW season 2 achievements.  Still can't get any of the ascended trinkets to complete these collections.
---
Cooking 500 collection was pretty fun. I actually also enjoyed making Nevermore as well.
---
I think I see a wearable ugly Christmas sweater
---
&gt; I feel 
---
How you feel isn't relevant. Zojja's Berseker Insignia costs 28.89g to craft. There are 18 orders over 34g on the TP for that item. That's 90 globs converted to 90g+ with just that one insignia.
---
Well, congrats on having 6 times as much to spend on nothing!
---
Strength, pack, fireworks, ogre, spellbreaker, vampirism... 
---
Really depends on what you prefer/need and what you're doing if you're not min-maxing for DPS.
---
I strongly recommend inquest bracers over those ones, on the medium set.  Also consider Triumphant Brigandine for the chest.
---
Remember to talk to this asuran npc (at 41 second) every day when the festival starts to receive a gift https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tu0hJfv8Is&amp;t=41s because not everyone knows about it.
---
Can you reselcted stats with that gear? Or just choose one prefix when u get it?
---
lol the amount of players that actually try to do every achievment is minimun, most players do what ever find fun and leave, and guess what, most players only stayed there for 1/2 hours tops
---
and even if that wasn't the case,  ayinmaiden already made a full guide video of every achievement, each one lasts for 5 to 7 minutes, so a player following them would finish all of them in 2 hours, maybe 3 if they take it lightly....
---
People here have always said the most idiotic things, but the concerning part is that it made it to positive double digit score. So there's at least 11 more people reading right now who were like, "Yeah I agree, professional humans never make mistakes" than the amount of people who were like, "No, that's fucking stupid." And *that's* the sign that the subreddit is beyond help.
---
Welcome to the real world, where all humans make mistakes no matter who they are or how important the mistake is.
---
But the production of commodities, including videogames, are the result of labor. Capitalism dictates how the profits are distributed and who owns the means of production, which translates into predatory business practices in the name of maximizing profits.
---
There is also an alternative to running minions, you know.
---
no. have I posted a snarky comment to stir up drama or did he? hm? I just answered.
---
But it's a strike so it's clearly "new content".
---
in your dystopia you will be gone long before me.
---
I hated C&amp;C it was chronically buggy.
---
If it was released this week, it would've ended on New Year's Eve, which is a silly time for it to end.
---
It's a three week festival, it'll stretch over both Christmas and New Year's to allow the Arenanet staff time off with their families.
---
New, as in never before seen in 2019...yes.
---
you should look at the whole picture from another side.  
---
character customization is a big thing in nearly every online game now. memes like fashion frame (warframe) or fashion wars (gw2) are not coming from nothing. its something a lot of players do...and if you got the money, be it real money or a lot of ingame gold helps you a lot with it. remember that there are infusions which aren't listed on the market because they go for 20k.  
---
also you can pay players for a lot of shit, this has been the case since the days of rushing stuff in gw1. you can literally buy dungeons, raids, fractals cm't titles etc.  
---
dudes like guild mm bought out whole guilds for wvw for server transfers and other shit...wvw politics where big a few years earlier and gold was a driving factor as it seems.   
---
also if you really want to min max the whole game with all the builds and infusions ontop, you already need a lot of gold.  
---
so yes, if you really want, you can pay to win the game. while other need a lot of time to setup their accounts with all the shit, you can literally pay to win yourself in 1 day to endgame gear if you want. you might not be better, but time saved is also already a factor when it comes to something like this.  
---
time is worth something. there is a reason why people say: rather work 1 hour more and buy gold because thats better spend time then farming for 1h. also there is a reason why some people have 30+ accounts. they wouldn't do that if it wasn't profitable.
---
Yeah, unfortunately being hard-locked behind multiple bugged events ruined my overall experience.  I had a much more fun time with Nevermore and the jumping puzzles.
---
nah,sry im not gona do same shit 7th time.
---
Obsidian shards, personally.
---
I don’t play necro but congrats on having your first 80. Hete you can find some builds to try put: http://metabattle.com/wiki/Necromancer
---
I got HoT physical, brand new for less than one 80 boost.
---
Why would they _ever_ refuse to recognise old keys especially if those keys were obtained from a **bought** version of the game?
---
For the second argument, yes their version isn't perfect at all but the core is free. It also isn't relevant to the topic really.
---
* Requiem pauldrons
---
* Requiem chest
---
* Etherbound gauntlets
---
* Inquest legguards
---
* Etherbound greaves
---
If you want the dyes aswell: A mix of Redemption, Pyre and Shadow Abyss
---
I currently have 255k Karma and 120 Gold. Would it be worth spending the karma or just buy it off the TP?
---
&gt;this is the same company that just broke an addon to sell a worse version of the same feature on the gem store.
---
No, it IS the topic, the topic being not trusting anet farther than I can throw them.  because *this is the same company that just broke an addon to sell a worse version of the same feature on the gem store*.  The only wonder is how the game is still running when **less** incompetent and **less** greedy devs of **more** successful games had theirs shut down.
---
downvoting me won't make the Truth go away, but it does out you as a coward.
---
The Wintersday JP(and Clocktower JP) is my bread and butter, time to get some gold! Can’t wait.
---
nearly every game with p2w is like: if you play long enough and farmed enough, you can still beat those which bought their way up when they suck at gaming.  
---
uh, big news that you will be better then someone new. give that newb a dedicated week and he will beat your ass.  
---
...the reason why there is more and more shit coming to the shop which is borderline pay to win is because of people like you: "pay to win is only if you can buy powercreep and always win on whatever content".  
---
no its not. pay to win these days is already when you can buy yourself out with time...if someone is able to get his account through paying to a level on where others spend 3 to 5 years then it is pay to win and a straight slap into the invested time.
---
This made me laugh way too hard, I better see you there 24/7
---
I've been pleasantly surprised by the HOPE collections. I'm not too fond of the legendary grind on its own, but the collection and the tidbits of lore and story have balanced that out for me. It felt like a real journey, chasing after Hylek and Asuran alchemy and technology, loosely linked to the rest of the game. 
---
It's something no other MMO does as effectively, either. Revisit old content, punch a certain boss you seldom fight, loot a chest in a cave you never saw before and here's a jumping puzzle you didn't do since 2012. It's nice. 
---
...I'm also not about to do it again because #$!@ earning thousands of gold in a chunk, but y'know, it's been a delight.
---
I think them making all the different hubs for crafting etc was a mistake. Lions Arch was the hub that tied the game and rue player base together. Now 
---
Things seem seem fragmented or empty
---
Is there a way to turn those into gold?
---
Until you can confirm that the report button actually does something EXCEPT make the reporter feel good about themselves, it doesn't make me wrong in any sense. Are you basing your statement on factual evidence or simply spouting nonsense because it fits your narrative? You might say that I don't have any evidence that the report button DOESN'T work, and you are correct. I made this thread in order to confirm that statement myself. The burden of proof is therefore on you to prove me wrong, which, you have not done so far. I await your insider knowledge on ArenaNet's business practices. Do not be mistaken, I HOPE you will prove me wrong. I HOPE that ArenaNet will prove me wrong. I simply await proof.    
---
I think you're trying too hard to be in tune with your icon. I understand that you're trying to insult me because, as your icon states, you're not sorry that your words hurt. Unfortunately for you, your insults pale in comparison to what I deal with on a daily basis in PvP. I won't ask you to apologize because that's clearly above you.
---
I saw this vid  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9a29O7mblw&amp;t=325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9a29O7mblw&amp;t=325s)  and u can see at the end this guy has 8 wardrobs unlock in the total and yet he got 9 skins. Dont know if it was a bug or that anet just changed that.
---
I did not know about this function. I'll have to look for it in Options. Instead of manually having to block everyone, a muteall option would be most beneficial at this point. Thank you for your contribution.
---
HELSETH IS MY KING!
---
It's not too late. ^(It's never too late.)
---
Let's hope that the third tier will simply be available to unlock if you have unlocked the Tier 2
---
I really do not know that
---
I sure hope so. I haven't really seen anything so far, but maybe in the future, ArenaNet could release some sort of statement just to show that they know PvP still exists.
---
What happened to this guy? I happened to be back to reply to some posts and he's deleted? Did he remove his comments? I don't even know what he wrote now... Maybe it was important....
---
Is there a guide for farming Wintersday karma?
---
We're just not enlightened enough for your superior intellect.
---
Yeah, it was a stupid question.
---
And I thought the 14k karma I got back when I was playing at launch was a lot
---
&gt; you just need a scapegoat for your sad lives, I refuse to be it.
---
Wtf? What's wrong with you? I just asked a simple question. No reason to act like an asshole. Calm down...
---
Best thing ever. Watch Netflix and do winter bells without sound! Helps when other people randomly smash keyboard out of tune :(
---
I'll let you think that you've won yet another internet argument then proceed to block you because you're nothing more than an inconvenience at this point.
---
Agreed. Probably about 1mil on obsidian shards for me, what else is there to spend them on really?
---
Thanks! Is there advantages by using the Volatile tools?
---
Some of the precursor collections are very generic: do 3 world bosses, 4 fractals and 5 other events. But some are really beautiful and contain a lot of creativity. Like Howler I (transform into a wolf and hunt animals) or Bifrost III (paint some landscapes) or my favourite, the Juggernaut I (study the architectural wonders of Tyria).
---
Pick a ranger or guardian if you want to heal, condition damage and power damage in highest level content. Although rangers subclass druid is absolutely necessary for high level content completion pug groups.
---
It's holiday season. Probably a new trainee was allowed to pull some levers and push some buttons
---
Yeah I'd love both, thanks!
---
How exactly if we are talking about skill does paying affect your skill? No shit someone who dedicates a whole week trying to learn a specific raid and rotation will beat me out if I have normal gear, that's closing the gap with time, put me in blues with some food and runes (which is less than the daily 2g) and I guarantee I'd still beat him, which is my whole point. It's about **skill** vs "look at what I bought" You can buy the BiS items and still be completely decimated by someone who's naked. Take Clash of Clans for example, The top players literally bought their way there, it was a heavily P2W game, even if you played for years straight without buying a single gem you still lagged behind the top leaders no matter your skill level, you could completely obliterate anyone you came across it wouldn't have made a difference because A. They had better stats, better walls, better bases and B. could whip out 10-15 raids vs your 1 because **they paid cash.** if you wanted to have a max base it would take **years** where the best player in the world bar none wouldn't even touch past the 50% mark. Meanwhile if someone who is naturally *very* good at this game could gear up, learn and complete raids in a week, pulling his own weight from straight up skill, not because he has a few extra nodes in his home, not because he has 100g+ you can raid smartly for a few gold, there are plenty of skins that look amazing if combined right even, both A. "Win" the game and B. Look good while doing it where as dumbass McGee over here is still drooling on his keyboard with all of his gemstore items. Your argument is flawed, you can start a brand new account, level 2 and go top out on the leaderboards in PvP, go level to 80 and slaughter anyone in WvW, turn around and go whoop every last raid boss, world boss, JP and fractal from straight up skill. Its identical to those who do speed runs, they can start fresh, on the same playing field as everyone else and from their time and dedication beat you by days if not weeks, it's the **exact same thing** here except you are trying to compare a 10s/day difference to "omg its p2w" and having a skin is p2w when no one in the fashion community pays anyone any type of respect from a half assed skin thrown over your armor.
---
If your goal is karma orphan runs should be on the top of your list.
---
what?? Joke or real?
---
Go to Services --&gt; Turn off Windows Search --&gt; Turn off SysMain. Make sure you click Disable so it doesn't turn back on. Both of these cause CPU issues. (SysMain is just renamed Superfetch. It's not as important as it sounds.)
---
The collections attached to the weapons that won the design contest were fun. Pretty short but enjoyable, nothing too tedious.
---
How do you make a trailer for 6 year old re-hashed content? LMAO
---
It's real! you can get up to 50 players in that cutscene with a squad (we had about 20 backup dancers for this video). Something else you can do with this cutscene: use a tonic before it starts.
---
Just curious, what is the "reason enough to do the content"? The only things added to the event have been .0001% chance infusion drops targeted at players with gambling addictions to spend all of their money.
---
