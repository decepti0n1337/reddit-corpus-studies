is there a way to refine the bot that auto comments on posts with a link to the Q&amp;A, so that it is able to reach more of those kinds of posts? It seems people feel the same way about new player posts and posts asking repeated questions, in that they both belong in the Q&amp;A, though the repeated questions seem to get the bot way less.

I’m sure you guys would like to duo fractals, but they’re really made with 5 people in mind, which is probably where your troubles are coming from. Minion Reaper is totally fine as a build, but you two should definitely post up in the LFG to fill out your party and things will hopefully go much smoother!
---
warrior just need MAJOR rework on skills,traits,utilities....
---
It looks like older-school western animation and I'm in love with it.
---
Yes, I'm in NA -- and I was just running around Divinity's Reach a while back completing LW on her! In that case, a very delayed hello if that was really was me.
---

---
Thank you for the Schrodinger's screenshot also, I take my fashion wars looks very seriously. :)
---
Not really as we can't predict how someone is going to word a post. There is no way for us to get 100% of question posts automoderated, but that's also what reports are for and we as moderators decide to okay it or remove it.
---
Yes you can but it'll always go to the highest buyer. He simply gets the item and the price difference back. 
---
&gt; Faster shortcut 1 with no dodge jumps.
---
This one is pretty rng. I used to do it but its really inconsistent if I could get it to work or not. My 2 cents is do the route you can consistently pull off each time. If you fail that jump once you're already wasting time compared to the other route.
---
Thanks for the info.

Lake Doric has amulet and backpiece.

Earrings come from Bitterfrost Frontier and Ember Bay.
---
Not guaranteed, but the drop rates got moved back up to parity with jade shards/petrified wood/fire orchids.
---
so they were going to try to find his physical body, and use the stasis chamber to rehabilitate it?
---
I just gave you 4 different very important endgame goals that only have one strict way of being acquired... I really dont see your point.
---
Unfortunately, gliders are gliders and griffon is griffon. I wouldn't mind some kind of air current type of thing in PoF maps to keep the griffon up in the air or allow it to gain height, but it was probably not added for a reason. Griffons are not just gliders anyway due to the speeds they can reach and how they technically can build height and maintain it if you're high up enough. It's kind of like a really advanced glider except no updrafts or it would be OP which would also not be fair because the griffon is a hidden mount you have to spend gold on, but the glider is free and only costs a few mastery points to get updraft use.
---
1. They're coordinated by guilds and planned and usually advertised ahead of time and put up in LFG before starting. Commonly, they start at the top of the hour at the beginning of VB.
---
1b. HP trains aren't super common in PoF. All of the PoF hero points are soloable, so going in a group doesn't speed them up, unlike HoT where they typically require multiple players. Plus, the PoF maps are much larger and longer to get across for players without masteries.
---
2. There are a lot of weird random items throughout the game that are either for achievements or just have unique purposes that require karma to get. You can also use it to buy obsidian shards from a few vendors if you get low. And during the Wintersday holiday you can buy crafting materials with it. I'd recommend to not really worry about karma as you'll generally rack up plenty and eventually find things that need it.
---
3. Not really much to be wary of. Maybe Unbound Magic and Volatile Magic? The game offers a whole lot of tempting ways to convert them to materials, but it's common for various vendor items from the living world releases to cost 1K-10K currency so having a reserve is useful.
---
Yeah. Scrappers should be renamed Immortal Cancer class in WvW. At this point in the game, it seems Anet loves creating high dps super tanks that cab't be kiilled. They suddenly nerf that class and do it again with another over and over and over. I feel like we're getting trolled when Anet says "balance patch." 
---
Plz...no!
---
I'll link what I'm testing atm: https://youtu.be/IKCGGBrtn5w

The whole channel is essentially off meta zerg builds, the ones that work I make guides for. Should have one for power fb in a week or two
---
is there some way to rearrange tabs in the chat window? I swear you could just drag them around but nothings working and now I'm worried i just dreamed it
---
I still can't hear anything but Jimmy Neutron whenever she speaks. Makes at least a bit of sense for Taimi, but that clip was just wrong. 
---
anet, i demand legendary snowboards
---
So what you and your friend want to do is the following:
---
Get full exotic, matching gear. Get a full set of matching exotic runes. You can look on snowcrows.com or metabattle.com for some builds. Exotic armor is super fine to do fractals with. It's all about the runes.
---
Note that most trash mobs in gw2 aggro on toughness. If he has even slightly higher toughness than you (which if he's a minion master, he will probably), then he will be getting 100% of the aggro. At lower levels, his minions probably had higher toughness than him and received most of the aggro.
---
Does he have reaper fully unlocked? It's a melee based class, but all alt specs are pretty bleh when not fully unlocked. He should be swapping to shroud quite often.
---
Minion necro can be played safely in t1-2 fractals. After that he's going to want to switch to just having the big old stompy elite and maybe the healing minions. Especially if he goes power reaper. When he learns to do t4 fractals, then he can go for a comfort build like minion master, but until then it'll be adding artificial difficulty.
---
that lets me edit or delete them but not rearrange
---
Feel free to move to new areas. Just take the portals near the edge of the zones. You also have the waypoints at other race's starting zones unlocked by default, but if you're level 15 and own the game, there isn't really a reason to go there.

Dragon Hunter doesn't realistically bring a lot of cc. If you said that brings a decent amount of cc then it would've been acceptable.

*Hi human!* It's your **1st Cakeday** RayBun4! ^(hug)

If they used the black citadel gates, they'd actually play into the Charr's hands. The citadel gate is rigged to explode because the Charr *expect* an attack from the Asura.
---
Thank you!  
---
It's been a wonderful trip!
---
I would have done it earlier, but I really wanted to finish the personal story.
---
I'm a simple man.  I see comments begging for upvotes or complaining about downvotes, I downvote out of reflex, because such comments generally aren't contributing to any meaningful conversation.  Lo and behold, reading through the thread, the only ones that aren't derailing from the potential idea are the ones where OP is talking to the mods about CSS and how it's not a possible idea.
---
Internet points are worthless, downvote me if you disagree.
---
I'd love to see the longbow trait out of the tactics traitline. I got tactics just for that trait with my berserker, but the rest of the traits has mediocre to bad sinergy overall. 
---
In lore there are horses. Ingame there are skritts riding on skritts with a horse costume ... so it counts? :D
---
Same difference, I've seen both variants xD
---
Dragonbags actually from my experience is the easiest server to farm. All they have is numbers so basically you get lots of bags since they do nothing else but throw bodies at you lmao. Feelsgoodman
---
&gt; Meanwhile, almost all non-Rata Sum large colonies and cities have failed 
---
I think you forget all the Inquest colonies. They are literally everywhere.
---
And yes, the Inquest is a big part of the Asuran society, unlike the flame legion is for Charr.
---
What the guy above was suggesting was: you can delete all of them and recreate in any order, using the checkboxes to set the filters.
---
&gt; While the asura we've seen is more or less their entire population and cities as all non-Rata Sum colonies failed, be it thanks to destroyers, chak, or golem uprising.
---
&gt; 
---
If you think of the inquest, that's not true at all. They setteled literally everywhere, successful.
---
And choppers, tanks and submarines against energy shields, laser weapons, golems and power suits? I mean I think there is a reason why we use golems and power suits against dragon champions and not charr tanks. Also, have you seen all the Inquest killer golems?
---
ah i see. at that point i probably have the gold to gear one of the other classes. 
---
yeah thats a easy switch. will definitely look into it.
---
huh. TIL Abbadon supported the Flame Legion's effort in retaking Ascalon and invading Kryta and Orr.. [interesting.](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Titan)
---
Asura obviously. The Asura always almost end the world by accident. Imagine if they actually tried being destructive on purpose. Fire elementals, giant mega destroyers, supercharged cube golems, giant raptors, and who knows what else. Open up their gates and flood the charr with monsters. Or heck they could probably figure out a way to over charge the asura gate and send the black citadel into the moon.
---
Thank you for permanently damaging my hearing with that god awful cacophony of intro "music". 
---
Everything that is Rare or Exotic gets that popup. 
---
The vast majority got zombified? Look at core Tyria maps, they are everywhere, Rata Primus and Fahranur were only two outposts/research bases.
---
Province Metrica, Brisban Wildernes, Mount Malestrom (literally the whole map is full of them), Dry Top, everywhere in Orr, Draconis Mons and so on. You can find their bases everywhere. 
---
&gt; Plus, Charr also got the olmakhan. Maybe not as smart as the inquest, but you can't deny the usefulness of big fuckin' sand golems. 
---
Their sand golems are a point but... the reason why the Olmakhan splitted from the other Charr was, because they don't want war. Why would they help them?
---
Oh yeah you’re right hahaha, my mistake!
---
What the op said means that warrior is the only class that is well designed and allows for some individuality with the build, while other classes just copy and paste the same build from one another....
---
Didn't they reach out to the developer of arcdps's mechanics plugin because the original version showed squad boons, which is a no-no (and wasn't that resolved with the developer updating the tool and no users getting banned)?

Yeah, I missed half of it, but got in from TD onwards at 7am.

Asura.
---
Arenanet have turned the Asura into a Sci-Fi genius master-race that pretty much know everything and can achieve anything.  For every Charr technological advancement you can name the Asura have one twenty times more technologically advanced.
---
All the others, by comparison, are grounded in the fantasy renaissance/industrial revolution esque era that the game is set.
---
Where do you play that several people go down to chokebow thief? 
---
&gt; Chrono meme is only true for the chronos who try to eke every last drop of deeps out of their support class.
---
You're talking to a chrono main
---
Remember wvwers and pugmanders, this is why you're better off kicking pugs with wonky builds and specs immediately. 
---
It does seem a little odd that we pay sell-order tax when we're simply filling an existing buy order, though.
---
My guess is that it's probably because they were already designed with the new state of mind they used for the update and that the only runes that really/mostly needed upgrading were the old ones.
---
Many of the HoT/PoF runes are still pretty strong/useful in their own place too so they maybe didn't need that much work.
---
And your statement is not 100% correct because iirc Rune of the Tempest was touched by adding a  +10% Condi Duration on the last tier. 
---
Technicaly there are no daily achievements like in Fractals but there are daily rewards you can get only once per day. If you would do it another time you wouldnt get these. Yes they are not achievements but they are still daily based rewards. These I have in my mind. If these Bubble Bubbles rewards for the first run would work as daily in Fotm, you would get all of them for the zone after finishing Trib mode. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Example: If you would get 3 Bubble Bubble for Trib , 2 for normal and 1 for easy then you would get 6 Bubble Bubble after finishing Trib mode. 
---
The core maps are locked in time, so all the things (events, dungeons, etc.) that have happened is not reflected in those maps as we do them daily and so on, so core Tyria maps are likely not affected by inquest anymore as we as players are doing events to remove them and defend the world against them.  
---
And why would the inquest feel obliged to help the other asurans? they have no incentive to help unless they are being targeted specifically by the charr.  
---
The Olmakhan have joined our wars so far due to the state of the world, so they are already reintroduced to war again.  
---
But I'd probably leave these factions out of it, I don't consider them part of the "charr" and "Asura" race as mentioned in the original topic, as both factions try to isolate themselves from their fellow racial population.
---
It is a Rare item so you have to confirm that you want to do it. This is probably a remnant of when Rare items were actually rare and not like you get them more than you can count.
---
the charr would win, they beat the humans no matter how many heroes they threw at the charr.
---
plus the asuran are too pragmatic to fight against large odds, they'd measure the losses in terms of resources before the war began, they'd put a big show as a bluff, then move their entire city during the confusion to some remote place and leave a scorched earth behind them.
---
It would also be great for gold sellers to transfer the money as items unfortunately.
---
The new bond with aurene with the latest living story mastery

You can't use updrafts while on Griffon and you can't dismount midair unless you have the Bond of Faith Mastery which after a bit of using it you can glide if you're still in the air.

Is there a specific Unity functionality you used in order to accomplish this effect?

Ok, lets compare rune of the spellbreaker with rune of the thief. 
---
Spellbreaker Rune: +175 power +100 precision +7% dmg  
---
Thief Rune: +300 precision +100 condition +10% dmg
---
Both seek the same role, but Rune of the thief gives 9,5 more Crit chance and 175 power gets outmatched by the  3% difference in the 6th tier. (The Condi Dmg doesn't matter)

---
Well, look at the world map how much inquest bases exist and how much we really destroyed. Mostly we just stopped certain experiments, but that's it. 
---
Also it's very unlike that all Inquest members went to Elona. Referring to the story it was pretty hard to be choosen to work there. 
---
&gt;And why would the inquest feel obliged to help the other asurans? they have no incentive to help unless they are being targeted specifically by the charr.
---
Since it's a war of Charr and Asura, they are targets. Like I said, unlike the Flame Legion, the Inquest is a part of Asurans society. They aren't enemies ore rejected, even if they are the "bad guys" sometimes. No, the Arcane Council accepts the Inquest, they even have minimum one Inquest member. The Inquest have laboratories in Rata Sum, Metrica and so on, they live in Rata Sum, Metrica and so on, they just live among the "good" Asura. So ofcourse a war agains the Charr would be their problem too. 
---
&gt;The Olmakhan have joined our wars so far due to the state of the world, so they are already reintroduced to war again.
---
As you said, they only joined because the whole World were in danger, to protect the world and not to destroy whoever. That's different from a "normal" war. 
---
However, even if they join, all in all the Olmakhan are a pretty small tribe.
---
&gt;But I'd probably leave these factions out of it, I don't consider them part of the "charr" and "Asura" race as mentioned in the original topic, as both factions try to isolate themselves from their fellow racial population.
---
But that's not the case. The Inquest *don't* try to isolate themselves from other Asuras. They are not like the Nightmare Court or the Flame Legion. I know I'm repeating, but the Inquest is an accepted part of the asuran society. Some experiments are controversal, but that's it. They don't try to control or destroy Rata Sum or seperate themself. They are more like "the black sheep". 
---
Leaving the Inquest out of it would be equal to leave one of the high legions out of it. Imo.
---
Simply said play whatever you wish till you will get into time gated bosses. Cm Fotm its mostly when it starts. Any boss wich you need to kill before time runs out will require you to have better and stronger builds. Thats where meta builds will come into the play. 
---
Block them.
---
Not really? The thief rune focus more on Condi rather than power. It gives no power at all, but rather condi. With the extra crit chance helping with procs from sigils and traits for condis. 
---
I probably have no idea what I'm talking about, but how in the world can a rune with condition damage on it be purely power DPS oriented?
---
I've heard that guardians are really useful in all content types (albeit with different builds/specs), so if you want to learn just 1 class that would be useful, this would be a good start.
---
Other than that pick whichever is the most fun for you to play.
---
Obviously the only thing you really need ascended armor for is Fractals due to the agony resistance, so equipment shouldn't be any deterrent for you to try out all of the mentioned game modes and see what's fun for you.
---
Asura would just develop a disease that would affect char race and throw it on the city to be spread. 
---
Char number would decline , as this happen they would be focus in finding a cure , while Asura would prepare themselves for a strike.
---
City in chaos and a plague going on the char would be force to separate the diseased from the ones who are still clean, this would create an internal conflict between their own race. 
---
The city is divided , 2 desperately sides , 1 fighting to be attended and cured , other fighting to block those who have the plague. 
---
Asura just had to work on their tatical and fast attack  while they kill themselves. 
---
Asura = win
---
Nope. 
---
The 3 "Meta" condi Runes are: Renegade Runes, Nightmare Runes and Lich Runes.
---
2 of those have a flat %Condition Damage.
---
Well, there's one [just hanging out in Iron Marches](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Searing_Cauldron)
---
Thanks for sharing a complete match and not bs highlights. 
---
Is there any sub for sharing pvp/wvw videos?
---
Wait, what? %damage is power specific, not including condition?
---
YOINK! 
---
Fucking LOVE your expressions. How do you do it? Do you spend hours with crippling anxiety that the expressions are not good enough and keep changing them? 
---
Nope. But there are a lot of %Condition dmg Modifiers aswell. But generally speaking, on a condition dmg Build you would want to get 100%  condition duration first. 
---
Soulbeast need buff..
---
&gt;my son had nightmares for a week and cried for hours. up until that point i didnt really care what this bloke did. but that was the final straw.

---
Some people will tell you the pvp is shit.
---
Other people only play sPvP.
---
Guild wars 2 pvp is something i have always enjoyed.
---
You just gotta figure it out. I get the feeling a lot of people never really learn to play and then pass judgement. 
---
Nah look at the hair, that’s Norn hair 
---
(+ on my first Norn I forgot to give her tattoos and regretted it so much until I got a makeover kit ;—;)
---
Toxicity is lower in GW2 than any other pvp game i have ever played.
---
Bots are far less common now days IMO.
---
So like every other dps. You're right , that's very differentiated.
---
Also you don't need 5 weapons to be ready for all situations
---
&gt; Victory condition - extermination or surrender of the other side
---
Under this conditions no one would, there are several lore and pc charr and asurans that would not surrender or die. Most likely they would come to some sort of agreement after any kind of major losses from any side.
---
Be more specific and structure your text better. I stuggled to understand what you tried to say and I guess it was the same with anet.
---
You are absolutely right. Player characters in Gw2 are pretty awesome. I am more thinking of Canon NPCs with my criticism and there also things are a matter of taste.
---
I prefer the over the top style important characters from WoW, but that design patterns has disadvantages. In Gw2 the PC feels more important (backed up by the personal story), not just another cogwheel. 
---
Happy for you :) Whats next?
---
Same for me and I never did it again afterwards
---
they don't seem to rebuilt waypoints quickly but the gates ... they are damn fast with the gates. and they have even portable gates now.
---
i still remember your beetle racing vs random sticks and roots one.
---
the SKREEEEEEEEE and the distant figure pointing out a faraway root is just perfection.
---
We will rid Tyria of all elder dragons and become it's overlord before we beat this guy 
---
dont forget the thing that took out ascalon in the Searing
---
So after playing around for ages with graphical settings etc, I cant figure out why sometimes it happens and other times its fine, very confusing! 
---
What do you mean, what's next?
---
Now I can finally play the game!
---
...oookay. Then I see how a +10% damage +100 condition damage rune is able to be a pDPS rune.
---
Thanks for the explanation.
---
&gt; can anyone give me any ideas on how to get anet to actually listen
---
"report him ingame" it works. and is simple too, right click &gt; report, anet will investigate, they wont even need your screenshots. 
---
Second step would be to not give a fuck, does it mater what one individual says about your guild? Anyone who chooses to believe him over you (whatever you have in mind - is it recruiting post, events you organize, some other guild ranking system i do not know about?) should not concern you anyway.
---
Yes
---
The problem is not the build, it's him. He has to learn mechanics and refine his gameplay to not die.
---
Well,  I see myself, in less than five years, in your position, interviewing prospect employees and asking them their plans for the future.  
---
Jokes aside, there's still HoT and PoF to go through, and I'm getting some experience with my Necro in WvW, even though I suck in PvP.  
---
Then, who knows, learning all masteries, maybe...
---
You are hired!
---
Try different weapons and different skills while you're leveling, and don't worry about "optimizing" your build until you hit endgame.
---
Flesh golem's active thanks to multihit is one of the hardest hitting cc skills in the game :)
---
Main problem it is not a competitive mode, unless you play tournaments (which requires a team of 5) but that also has been abused in the past. Ranked pvp, is a hot join reward farm mode, therefore balanced or not you always have RNG factor of what are other players up to.
---
Balance is ok, i mean.. anyone can play anything and re log to balance things out. This kind of balance is probably acceptable by the most players, unless you are free to play and only have 2 character slots.
---
Population is very limited, but not in a quantity sense, big part is there to farm rewards.
---
Cheating and win-trading is not a rare occurrence here as well.
---
**As long as you want to play for fun it's ok, great even. 2 minute average queues, 8-12 minute matches, you can even get on top 500 list, with enough dedication and rng.**
---
Check some YouTube guides for ele, weaver or tempest (elite specs of ele) because there's some useful tricks that you can use. Even older ones can be relevant (don't look at builds, just some tricks with skills that you can use).
---
Scrapper should've been left in the trash can where it belonged. The spec cannot ever be fun or enjoyable to fight against in PvP.
---
Start a new characters. Using the boost on your first character is the worst thing you can possibly do for learning the game - it's like jumping off the deep end of the pool without knowing how to swim. Or float. Or what water is.
---
Aaand, it's less than five years, so you're fired and I'm in your position, now!
---
Lornar’s Pass had hearts like ”go deliver food and drinks to patrons” and lot of caves. Always seemed like a pain to do.
---
Extermination or surrender. 
---
Depending on what happens afterwards, I think the Olmakahn would choose to surrender, if they can avoid a war this way. 
---
thanks for your advice, i just cant choose what do i want to play because earlier i spent playtime by just craftimg, doing JPs and farming mats so i asked for help :)
---
shouldnt it be better to focus on learning some meta builds before i get stack because of being useless?
---
they can not decide for all charr, so they only have a chance if all the other charr are exterminated, rox and rb included, (those would never surrender, and several asurans would never let them be killed by other asurans), so olmakahn are out of question anyways.
---
thanks for your answer, i think i gonna give guardian a chance but in my mind i really want to try reaper because of class emmm fantasy
---
thanks for your advice, i will look into DH and scourge, but why does somebody play dagger/dagger deadeye? i mean even class name looke like it should be ranged only
---
Who wants to know?
---
Not since they made daily quests give 2g, but maybe at launch this would be more relevant.
---
Except for the privateer set. Those are account bound.
---
If you already have Light Zerker Gear, I'd consider Power Reaper, good survivability and decent damage on a relatively simple rotation.
---
Regarding to several PvP player, who were temp banned because of insulting other players, I can say, yes Anet does something about it (even if it takes a bit). 
---
However, if you want a smart and quick solution -&gt; block him. Block him and you can't read what he is writing and also he can't whisper or mail you. Problem solved. 
---
My custom Reaper build is so fucking fun. People don't expect the 15k+ crit per auto attack, I watch my scythe mow down the squishier meta builds.
---
If you're trying to convert claim tickets to gold, you'll want this.

Some Black Lion Skins can be sold but some are account bound. Depends on what skin you bought. Take a look if you can sell it or not. If you are able to sell it, you can still keep it in your bank and sell it later when the price would be better. 
---
Deal, thank you for that
---
If it came to all out, no holds barred war that all 3 Legions were in favour of, the charr would win I think. They have *so* much more in the way of numbers, resources and most importantly organisation that it's not even comparable.
---
The asura could defend Rata Sum in a battle of attrition by portaling in supplies - subterfuge and sabotage would also be possible to great effect - but they simply lack the cohesiveness of the charr legions required to win any lengthy conflict.
---
The only way I see asura forcing the charr to extinction or surrender is with a pyrrhic victory involving weapons of mass destruction that left both races mutated and living in a crater.
---
Actually he didn't say anything about which fractions is included and which not. But however, lets say all are included. 
---
Olmakhan -&gt; surrendered, Ash, Blood, Iron and Flame Legion -&gt; exterminated. This includes all Charr.
---
So he hates you and goes out of his way to harass you for no reason at all? Sure I believe you.
---
Those are less Inquest colonies, and more like research bases.

Thanks. Didn't know about that. Appreciated.

I would have preferred the "suddenly revenant" variation with PoV montages of people exploding to revenants but this is the next best thing
---
Got the mount bug in mythwrite gambit's mini room, took a screenshot, turns out I'm a saint :&gt;
---
I mean I agree with you when you say that the Asura certainly COULD destroy the charr easily. I just think, that due to the nature of the asuran society (lots and lots of internal competition, sabotage and gigantic egos) the Asura would never be disciplined enough to even develop such a plague. 
---
Creating a virus like this is not something you can do during an afternoon on sunday. It would take teams of scientists to achieve something like that (at least in my imagination D: tyrian disease research isn't really something there is a book about). And to actually finish the plague in time the Asura would need to work together, without competition and sabotage.
---
Also, if war was declared I am quite certain that a big part of the asuran society wouldn't even care, their personal projects being a much higher priority for them.
---
During asuran history, they have proven to be the most technologically advanced civilization, but all their knowledge is wasted by the divisive nature of their society. Any time a conflict arises the Asura don't fight, they flee from it. And the reason for that is not them being weak, but them putting their own ego above the greater good.
---
Its not that the Asuran intellect wouldn't be enough to be victorious, it's the inherent structure of the asuran society that weakens them. The Asura are strong, but their biggest weakness is their lack of unity. Only a fraction of the Asura would be willing to give their life for the greater good of their people. The charr don't even hesitate. For them, no sacrifice is too great if it means victory in the end.

P.S. I enjoy this discussion :P

You just wanted to show your inventory ?

10/10 would hit that

Is the serpentile jewel from the treasure room in thunderhead peak not a guranteed drop? hasnt gotten it from the treasure box there 3days in a row
---
Actually, 3% doesnt outmatch the 175 power. The reason its better is because on the builds that you use it on you need that much crit to cap. If you look at the power/dmg difference 175 comes out ahead. Most dps classes have betwern 4000 en 4200 power, so lets say 4300 power which would work even more in the favour of thief.
---
Thief would give 4300*1.1 = 4730 effective power
---
Spellbreaker would give (4300+175)*1.07=4788.25 making it more efficient if a class would cap already at 100 precision
---
Thanks!
---
so Discretize's [Power Sword Weaver](https://discretize.eu/builds/elementalist/power-sword-weaver) build now contains [Unravel](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unravel) instead of [Conjure Lightning Hammer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Conjure_Lightning_Hammer) in the base build. Can someone explain why?
---
Just dont go to DR. Only time ive been there was for world completion and its just full of rpers/erpers
---
The list only contains the skins you can buy at the moment. On the top of the list you can see that it takes the information from the wiki, so if skins are missing in the list, they are either not available or nobody updated the wiki list.
---
While true healers aren’t as much of a thing in gw2 you can definitely play a boon support character (focusing on providing high uptime of key buffs.) the two expansions are pretty much entirely late game and with fractals, work events and living world content (plus raids ofc) you won’t be lacking for stuff to do.
---
I also find that because gear is deterministic (gear stats aren’t random and you can work to the specific items you need) the overall experience is better.
---
Not all skins can be purchased at the moment. They vendors cycle their inventory in and out at different times (this is why some skins are worth more than others at times - the supply is gone for many months before they can be purchased again).
---
I'm just going by experience with people who I know who've come from other games. I help a lot of new and returning players. It's something I enjoy a lot. So I meet a lot of people with certain expectations.   
---
Support here is broader than just healing. In fact, one of the devs said early on that healing is what you do when you're already losing. Avoiding damage in this game altogether trumps healing. There are a lot of ways you can be a support character in the game, but none of them involve watching little green health bars go up and down. It's a lot more complex and active than that, and takes a fair amount of skill. There are also no macros to help you with it. 
---
Healing here, when you do heal is more active. But again, there are other ways to support besides just healing.   
---
I like this style of play better, but then I never liked the other style of play.
---
Honestly...looking at those blue arrows reminded me more of the DH longbow 4 skill than the actual Ranger Barrage. That’s a great anime btw, cool stuff.

This might be a unpopular opinion this is my take on it-   
---
* Dungeon runs are not existent, it's very outdated and the rewards are just not there anymore.    
---
* Fractals(Mythic+), they're a daily machine. Nobody does them outside of dailies especially when you get to T4, which consists of 3-6~ dungeons per day, no incentive outside of dailies.   
---
* Raids, functionally the same as WoW, they're a weekly thing.    
---
The trinity system exists in GW2, but it's only later on when you get to more difficult content. If you're the kind of guy that spams dungeons for equipments or ugprades, that's not GW2 at all, i've been playing on-off since GW2 ever existed and played both WoW/FFXIV. However, i would still give this game a shot, just expect it to be different.

Just saying, you go on point AND MELEE with your rifle instead of enjoying the range of it? Why???

I like how everyone on here is advising OP on buying tips, completely oblivious that he/she is a 6 Year player and obviously knows how the Trading Post works. It's a long play joke, people. 
---
/R/whoosh 
---
Doing fractals will be as close to doing M+ in wow as you can get, it's a bit gated behind gear, but it's something to work towards in the end.
---
This game doesn't really have strict roles like WOW or FFXIV, but it's been getting better. Tanks and healers do exist, and they're necessary for raids (Only really need a healer in fractals.)
---
Other than that, you got wvw, pvp.. can try to do RP but it's pretty dead and/or confined to the human city which tends to hit the boundaries of goldshire level absurdity sooo..
---
&gt; realistically though the asura are so many generations ahead of the charr in technology that its not about numbers anymore
---
I disagree. While they're certainly more advanced in some aspects, they're overwhelmingly inadvanced in others. And military and war is one of those aspects that the asura are not specialized in.
---
And in the open world, so many of their inventions go haywire that you can't really even count them as advancements.
---
Charr anything. Go with the master race!   
---
See my other comment replying to you. TL;DR: Those are labs, not colonies, and they fall the moment someone decides to go after them, or one of their scientists take an experiment too far. Few survive an event chain.

i think the tavern keeper in the guildhall lets you choose which guild buff you want to activate (only 1 buff can be choosen).

---
Healing in GW2 isn't terribly fulfilling.  It usually isn't particularly complex, and you're limited in your ability to impact fights.  Often times if you're playing with *average* GW2 players they will not be doing good damage.  You'll feel powerless.  You'll pamper and babysit them to the best of your ability, but they'll find a way to go down, die or put you or the team in a compromising position. 
---
1.  Are my allies topped off? Can i top them off?
---
2.  Do I need to cleanse conditions? 
---
3.  Am I maintaining my boons (Might, Fury)
---
4.  Does someone need some extra love? 
---
5.  What CC can I contribute to break the bar? 
---
There are a variety of healers in GW2; Tempest, Scourge, Engineer/Scrapper, Druid, Firebrand, Herald/Renegade.  They each have unique advantages and disadvantages.  Part of the problem with healing in GW2 is that the overall player-base has a *terrible* understanding of where your heals are coming from.  They'll split off in extremely inconvenient ways that make your life hell. 
---
I'd suggest playing something that functions as a DPS-Support hybrid like Dragonhunter or Herald.  Something that can provide boons for its allies, or situationally useful utilities like Wall of Reflection, Stand Your Ground, or Virtue of Courage (DH F3).  The less reliant you are on other players early on in your GW2 experience the better.  While healers are more respected than in the past it's often a tedious, thankless chore that's practically useless outside of T3/T4 fractals &amp; raiding.

Probably because of a [recent speedrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp0P8O4cDts), it's become a popular farm for [fractal relics](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractal_Relic) and [fractal encryptions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractal_Encryption).
---
Airships are to a large part charr engineering, [according to this guy.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Captain_Skyfire) [Even that asura admits it.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pilot_Wanni)
---
Yeah and there's no reason build that even takes it, they just have to ignore it because it's so bad
---
Wait a minute. Those are Kurzick tactics!
---
Hasbro just called they want the 80's cartoon art back
---
Don't leave your volume up so high =D
---
initially, charr would decimate the asura, pushing them back with ease.   the ferocity, agression, and militant mindset of the charr.
---
however, Asuran tech would eventually slow down the Charr and eventually turn it around.   with portals forcing the charr to defend all the land they already took, plus their own.  thus spreading them out.
---
and suicide golems,  stealth golems, and mass production combat golems providing the charr with a never ending stream of problems.
---
the longer the war goes, the more the asura will have the advantage, until finally the asura would win.
---
but the victory would be that in words only,  any surviving charr would continue to be a thorn.  and it would have to be a war of extermination unless the Asura want a never ending gurilla campaign against them.
---
\&gt;   So if you do for instance W2Z1 in trib, you get the "normal" daily reward + the trib daily reward. 
---
No you dont. The World 2 rewards are doubled but not taken from normal dificulty.

---
Finding a small ass diamond on the world map as the only clue to new or returning players that they can easily play with their friend who started as another race is obvious and to be learned, extrapolated, and executed "the second they finish their character" when a new or returning players could possibly not even know of the existence of such a basic in-game feature? 
---
For a start - get a dps meter and tell us your actual DPS. that "elitist jerk" group might be just that - some random guys bashing anyone with 2k dps less than their "godlike" dps. But maybe your dps is actually lower than a SB should be at.
---
Instal Arc, hit the dummy for a few rounds and check how far from the average parses you are. For example - pulling 22-25k dps if a parse states 30k would be more than good in my eyes.
---
Pulling 10k would be far from perfect even tho 10k would roflstomp anything in open world on your own.
---
Arc is shown over your screen so no worries there. It would be really helpful for you to grab it and then share some logs if you are looking for specific feedback. Posting the logs on dps.report with the elitist insight (I think that is what it is called) option would really help. 
---
That way people can check to see how your DPS compares and analyse things like the food and utilities you are using as well as the rotation used during the opening and burst phases (presuming you don't get the stupid explosion mechanic). 
---
You can’t make progress without knowing your starting point. 
---
If you don’t like Arc, you can also use the test golem in the Special Forces Training Area in the Lions Arch Aerodrome. Either way, do what you do normally and see what your numbers are at. 
---
General tips for Power Soulbeast::
---
1. Know your rotations. 
---
2. Understand your rotations. 
---
3. Turn off auto-cast on your Greatsword chain attack. 
---
Cute charr tho
---
10/10 would cuddle
---
If you are not running arc then how do you know that your DPS is actually what you are aiming for? The DPS golem is the perfect environment in which you can have all the buffs at all time with a stationary enemy. This is not how the real encounters work in which you could have not max might, quickness or alacrity on you all the time, you could have reduced DPS because you need to actually evade or move in the fight. Another thing is food.
---
I have seen a lot of players claiming to have a meta build and doing their rotation perfectly and barely being able to pull of 5K damage. Not that I think you did it that way but rather ask the question of "how exactly do you know" that you are doing all those things.
---
And not everyone is an elitist prick just because they think you are not pulling your own weight and they are carrying you through the content.
---
ARCDPS is an injector which will only be displayed inside the GW2 window. If you have good food, gear, runes, sigils and the buffs up all the time then the only thing left is your rotation which will be under a lot of stress in a real encounter.
---
Sometimes you feel like you're doing a lot, but that's only because [ignorance is bliss](https://i.imgur.com/Zc5kDX3.jpg).
---
Get arcdps. Evaluate your own performance and compare yourself to others. If someone is vastly outperforming you, ask them for tips - most people will be glad to offer suggestions if approached properly. However, don't be a piece of shit to others based on what you see, especially if you cannot comprehend all factors involved (like most people using the tool).
---
That's just an example, it could be something else. Like attacking 20% faster for 5s after a burst, or gaining extra adrenaline per attack after weapon swap.
---
People forgot how to experiment stuff nowadays mate, that's all. I would like to close the case. It won't matter, but just saying- i've helped every single person that asked for it ingame. I love helping people. The problem is most of you don't know what constructive criticism is. The gain here is either he will start experimenting the game by his hand or he will totally ignore my comment. It's not like he will quit because of me, if he does it it'll be because he didn't like the game. 
---
I agree. Having asked a couple of low performers about their builds in fractals the main idea that they convey seems to be 'I feel like I do a lot of damage already' when really... it's not by performance standards. Ignorance really is bliss. If they aren't told or informed about their performance in some way, whether its being told by another player or using a metric meter like arcdps they usually don't improve their play.
---
Gear, food, etc are all spot on with dT and Snow Crows.  Golem rotation is fine.
---
I do have trouble keeping the rotation going while also dodging AoEs, but I'm not too sure how to help that.
---
Have all the proper foods and what not.
---
Maybe it is my timing as I don't always execute the full rotation on the broken bar.  
---
No, his physical body was destroyed. I think the intent (Haven't done the raids much at all however) was that they'd do the ritual which was bring him back (As we saw happened in Orr). After the ritual is completed he'd go into the chamber and get powered back up/healed fully by the bloodstone pieces.

This video showing Anniversary Mail Carrier is showing a Dragon tearing the Mists, and on the background there is the picture we see on Harbinger of Woe. 
---
&gt;  I would suggest to not choose the same thing.
---
This is horrible advice because nobody bothered to tell you that this choice would mean you and your friend have to do many missions twice. You said you're both Norn, so for example there are 6 missions between lvl 10 and lvl 30. There are actually 18 different missions and the 6 that you need to do are determined by your choice between:
---
* Defeat Our Ancient Foes
---
* Protect the Spirits
---
* Guard the Mists
---
If you and your friend make the same choice, you can do the 6 missions one time together and both get credit. If you make different choices, you'll need to do the 6 for the first person (with the 2nd person getting nothing), and then go back and do the 6 for the second person (with the 1st getting nothing).
---
This repeats itself in lvls 40 through 60 where first you have 15 mission split between the three orders:
---
* Durmand Priory
---
* Order of Whispers
---
* Vigil
---
...and then 15 missions split between which race you choose to help/investigate:
---
* Grawl
---
* Hylek
---
* Ogre
---
* Quaggan
---
* Skritt
---
...and then it goes back to being split based on your order with 18 more missions split up between: 
---
In lvls 70 through 80, you first have 18 missions split into three paths based on your greatest fear:
---
* Let an innocent die
---
* Dishonor my allies
---
* Make another suffer
---
...and then 9 more missions once again split based on which order you joined:
---
So, if you make different choices, that means you'll each end up doing a bunch of missions that aren't part of your storyline. Is that a great thing or a headache? That's up to you to decide.
---
&gt; If you are not running arc then how do you know that your DPS is actually what you are aiming for?
---
I don't, that's my point.  I will try downloading arc tonight after I do my key run.
---
&gt;And not everyone is an elitist prick just because they think you are not pulling your own weight and they are carrying you through the content.
---
I don't agree with kicking people when the bosses are going down like a hot knife through butter.  If people are dying, or the group is wiping or struggling, sure.  It's not 'carrying someone' unless they're down/dead half the fight and you're literally doing it 4 man.

---
&gt; Turn off auto-cast on your Greatsword chain attack.
---
This is a new one to me, why?
---
The Asurans. Because the Charr are superior warriors, and the Asurans know it. The asurans on the other hand are thinkers, planners. They probably have contingencies in place for every race. They have tech that lets them cross vast distances in an instant, charr don't. They have forcefields, charr don't. They have access to instant communications across the world(we've seen Satellite disks on some of their facilities), the charr....have a catapult that shoots cows. 
---
The bottom line, we've seen what the Charr are capable of. And as formidable as they are, we have yet to see the Asurans truly at war. 
---
Ryu ga waga teki wo kurau?

Oh then I'd be totally in fish out of water territory.  I've played ranger since release, and while I do have a fully leveled Daredevil I don't know the ins and outs of the class well enough to think I'd be able to keep up on it.
---
Did you looked for videos with Power Soulbeast on for example 100 CM or 99 CM? There you can see if there rotation matches yours and how they handle mechanics.
---
I found these with a quick search. Probably there are far more.

Honestly I'd say Elder Scrolls Online is a *much* better fit for you. It has healers and dungeons as a core pillar of ESO's group content, while GW2 explicitly went out its way to not create a healing role but ended up jerry-rigging one into the game in the first expansion and, imo, because of the way the combat system is designed (and because the game was never intended to accommodate a healing role) the healing builds in GW2 feel nothing like healing in most other games (in a bad way, imo). I say this as someone who mains a druid healer in GW2's raids and "dungeons" (GW2 abandoned dungeons but focused instead on "fractals", which for simplicity's sake are dungeons). On top of this GW2's content has no tank role, only in the tiniest minority of situation will tanking be a thing in GW2.
---
Elder Scrolls Online also has more traditional support for dungeon content. It has a lot more dungeons than GW2 and it adds four every year, with two difficulty modes each. The dungeons in ESO are better integrated into the game's rewards and incentives (while GW2 dungeon rewards are generic loot which basically amounts to a little bit of gold, ESO has unique rewards for each dungeon and achievements for specific cosmetics like skins and hats etc for people who do more difficult content).
---
The best fit for a person looking for a no subscription MMO that has both a traditional healer class and tradional supported dungeon content is ESO. There are strenghts to GW2 (casual open world group content is better in GW2 than any other MMO imo) but the instanced group content and party roles in dungeons is very niche compared to other MMOs. If you are looking for a different take on it (imo it's not as satisfying) GW2 is worth a look, but if you are looking for a no-sub MMO that offers the dungeon and party dynamics of WoW and FFIX, then ESO is a perfect fit for you.
---
Hmm, ok I'll work on doing that as I've just been sort of rotating through the rotation regardless of breakbar/phase.
---
In that case though, assuming the break bar is up or about to be up... what am I supposed to be hitting with outside of the 'max damage window?'
---
Valid point. Though the stipulation for victory we're extermination or surrender, I could see them surrendering well before being exterminated. While charr would have kittens holding rifles. 
---
And aye, honey Badgers give 0 fucks
---
Wow, glad I'm not the only one that did something very silly. 
---
That depends on their goal, motivation and what they are looking for.
---
If you joined a group which said that they do speedruns or something then you might not fit into the group and got kicked.
---
We only heard your side of the story and so far you only said that you were doing fine. I'm not saying that you are lying or wrong because I just don't know but there is not really something else to say other than get ARCDPS and recreate what happened and see how well you did. If you came close to what the meta build should provide then they were in the wrong but if you did not that much damage at all then they were right and you have to or would want to change something.
---
So, not everyone plays the game for the same reasons and some might expect something else from their team mates.
---
I tried and instead of locking up on Alt-Tab, it just locked up mid-play. Had to force-close the program and the crash-log shows only this single line:
---
"0 | "shader replace error" | hr = FFFFFFFF"
---
When it's not crashing the process, it works fine, though.
---
hm......what dragons do we have left?  any that we could use to make these 2 factions fight?  not to the end, we'd interfere before that.  but to see the opening impact.
---
Pretty much every server has those. Except maybe national ones, they are fond of doing karma trains.
---
People are saying that they're all fine but like half of them are completely dead. Like who is running Holosmith runes? Reaper? Daredevil? Scrapper? Soulbeast? Mirage? Dragonhunter? Scourge? Druid? Tempest? Weaver?
---
They're not just garbage versions of better runes, they're basement tier garbage versions of better runes.
---
It's up to you. If you see you can do a full rotation and be ready for the breakbar with another full rotation do it. Every class is different, it's up to you
---
No I haven't, I'll check some out.
---
As others already said, get Arc and try to understand where your dmg comes from and where it is lacking. Looking at skills and Trait combos etc. 
---
Ask other people or watch DPS guides, with explanations why they do the rotation this way and not the other. Even older videos can help, but keep in mind some traits may have changed.
---
Lastly it has nothing to do with your missing infusions. The max stats you can get are 90 from infusions, that’s not even the buff you get from food or cheap sharpening stones. The reason they are included in builds is just showing the optimal stats, and yes if you are full elitist, for the 0,5% dps increase...
---
As I said bufffood gives more and how many people do you see running around without bufffood, sometimes I forget about my food running out and no one cares and I only notice the dps loss on the paper and Arc dps showing me the numbers.
---
A properly played soulbeast will outdamage a Daredevil or Holo by something like 20% on most CM bosses.  You don't need to change class in this case; but soulbeast is indeed much more difficult to play.
---
I just like they have different Raid difficulties that go from noob to workhorse.
---
Hadn't considered that aspect.
---
Yeah I saw the note, but it mentioned using Fresh Air, so wasn't sure if that also applied to Bolt to the Heart. Was also confused because the build wasn't updated on mobile (the build was still from January if you selected the arrow next to builds then the weaver build), so realized like today it had been updated.
---
Are you playing on a N64?
---
I like CGI stuff and I've always craved for more of it from GW2.
---
...however, I don't think that this particular style of CGI fits this game. It's too cartoony and LoLy and doesn't do the game justice. I think it would've been better to follow the unique, rich style of the Fractured and HoT trailers.
---
Not so much on 100 (though I am, admittedly, absolute shit on the 2nd fight), but on 99 I also anticipate dodge-jumping and moving outward on the double AoE and it's a huge time-waste when groups actually hit the breakbar and cancel it.
---
What drugs are you on where SB out-dps's Daredevil?
---
Soulbeast is absolutely top tier in fractals, keep playing it.
---
Ummm yes?? Over my 6 years of playing I’ve been everywhere’s from 2K gold to 40 silver lmao. It’s super easy to build back up... but some people actually DO spend the gold they earn ;). I think OP took the screenshot at the wrong time lol I woulda waited a day or two until I could get it back up a little bit LOL

Daredevil is widely regarded as the easiest rotation to do, so honestly I would take the chance.
---
Please tell us more about how your thief can outburst soulbeast in fractals.
---
Those aren't the bosses I'm talking about though. Im specifically talking about when some random in your group calls out all the dps players on the Shattered Observatory bosses or the last Nightmare boss. Ignoring the fact that there are big chunks of time where 0 damage is done.
---
If they release the trailer this week or next then episode 6 should come before the 30th :D here’s hoping 
---
People also seem to forget that doing fine or having a smooth run differs trom person to person.
---
If I join/host a 150kp+ group I expect people to at least do enough dmg to skip the anomalies on arkk for the cc phases. If that doesnt happen I dont really see it as a smooth run. Now others might see a run as no downs as a smooth run, but the difference can be huge.
---
"11 million strong", interesting.
---
Is Sigil of Force and Sigil of Imapct still bugged when used in combination, or has that been patched?
---
In fractals which OP is talking about specifically? In every single world slb out dpses daredevil unless the phases take a year.
---
You can jump it with aegis. But since op was playing slb you can use gs3 or the 3rd aa to dodge it
---
To add, though: maybe it's good to have exactly an ad like that specifically for places like Facebook - to appeal to the Tera/WoW/LoL/whatever players, so that they can see something stylistically familiar before diving into the more serious nature of GW2.
---
But I sincerely do hope that this ad is not an indication of the stylistic shift - because I find this style bland and generic, and doing a disservice to what the artists of the vanilla releases managed to achieve aesthetically.
---
If you send a log my way ill help you analyze it :)
---
I love how they acknowledge but underplay the weapon/character glow XD
---
I mean, you can still compare them to good numbers for those bosses. If theyre comparing it with bench numbers theyre pretty stupid (though on the last 99 cm boss you can score close to bench too)
---
link a video of you on a run, posting dps numbers is useless cus it depends on boss and your group more than yourself
---
Oh god, it's so bad... it looks like a cheap chinese mobile MMO where everyone runs around with christmas tree weapons. Another disappointment.
---
Some nice tricks you can use for 99cm is use gs3 for the mama aoe spin attack, use it for siax aoe if you dont have aegis or use it for the exploding adds to keep scholar and not get blinded. On the final boss there is a neat little trick where he does the double aoe with the echo thingies. Cast gs3 when hes diving so you dodge it and then use an auto attack chain. If you have quickness it lines up perfectly to dodge the 2nd part of the attack. Just make sure to dodge the first dive rather late iirc
---
And all is revealed: 
---
discord.gg/uyuPxCN
---
You look like a potato saint, Fuzzy.
---
11 million accounts.
---
Of which 10,5 million are inactive, bots or twinks.
---
I loved it - got at least one goosebump! 
---
Ah yes, the fractured trailer was really beautiful!
---
iS tHAT a JOJO rEFERENCE?
---
TIL, wyverns have teeth on their tongue. That's pretty cool.
---
any overlay like arc dps for 32 bits? ye i know about 32 bits...
---
And you probably think there's 11 million players lmao
---
I'd go for Kill on WSR.  Bez is a fun driver
---
Anet going "All in" with gw2? HELL YEAH!!!
---
I remember I got a [Salvaged Excellence](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Salvaged_Excellence) from salvaging an ascended item. Sold it for 900g. Never had so much money.
---
Thes was shortly after griffons came out. I blew it on that, leveling a few professions to 500, and ascended gear.
---
I was about as broke as him in about a week.
---
Well seems pretty clear to me that you guys have hit a glass ceiling. Either improve your gear (full exotic is fine for now), your build (condi and power class dont gel together well. You should play a power chrono instead for example), group up with more people, or play the class better (dodging + knowing when to use active defense, bringing the correct utility to each fight) 
---
Something must change otherwise the outcome is the same.
---
Episode 3 free from 9th to 15th. Epsidoe 4 thw topic for welcome back event from 16th to 22nd. Episode 5 as part of the welcome back from 23rd to 29th. 30th open for Ep6.
---
SAB ends the 18th. Two Tuesday's later is the 30th. They never do a release or festival under 2 weeks / Tuesday's from the previous.
---
All lines up to me.
---
How about a proper Refer A Friend system, so we might actually put effort into convincing our acqaintances, intead of just saying 'i love this game, you should also try it, cya"
---
Ofc! That's why i said to test the dps on the golem. You can focus fully on your rotation and see how your best compares to the actual parse.
---
Anything else will differ a lot! 
---
You can sell the weapon set skins.
---
permanently nerfed in every patch for  3 years in row is enough i think =)
---
In which format are you looking for? Digital? Vinyl? CD?
---
The way they've been releasing/covering past episodes heavily implies it'll lead up to episode 6th on the 30th
---
&gt;the core soundtrack only has one listing (for a ridiculous price too)
---
The core soundtrack was a nightmare. It took over a year delivery for some people. Some even never got their copy.
---
One thing to be aware of,  a lot of those meta builds for fractal/raids you see are specifically designed for group play and to synergize with other classes meta builds.
---
Ie: boon support firebrand is amazing in group,  but absolutely blows by itself.  So if a lot of what you're doing is still solo play,  you can't exactly practice a group oriented build by yourself.   
---
If you're looking for a build that can perform well in both open world AND group play ( with minor tweaks rather then a complete build overhaul) that might narrow down what you're looking to accomplish?
---
I do hope that that is exactly the case; I'm just cautious since modeling such a bunch of unique characters for such a short clip only isn't exactly the most efficient use of money.
---
Of course only time will tell,  I’m pretty sure they made episode 3 free at the same time that episode 4 was out, so here’s hoping!!!
---
Eh, the free barrier per engagement has saved my butt from cheeky ganks plenty of times now in WvW. Which other rune offers that free barrier per engagement?
---
Does this really need a reddit topic? It's not that Aurora is a new legendary.
---
What's the difference between the free version and paid? (aside from expansion access)
---
Free one has [restrictions.](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/230165307-Guild-Wars-2-Account-Types-Free-Core-HoT-PoF)
---
They just posted an article saying Ep3 will be free starting tomorrow.
---
There's still nothing to do in the game btw don't waste your time
---
damn, congratz dude
---
I gave up on it.
---
God those light up weapons, so accurate
---
No, in guild wars 2 we ARE the christmas trees
---
I only used episode 3 as a reference lol they’ve had 2 episodes free at the same time ;) if Episode 6 was released the same week that episode 5 went free... I don’t see any problem with it.
---
Eh, I could see a subgroup (White Mantle, Separatists, people who aren't loyal to Queen Jennah?) of humans trying to do this, but not humans as a whole.
---
There's no such thing as in-game harassment lmao just turn off the computer
---
less available character slots, and chat/trade restrictions
---
https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/230165307-Guild-Wars-2-Account-Types-Free-Core-HoT-PoF
---
Nothing worth while. GW1 is the better game so just keep paying that
---
Failing to read my entire message has made you look dumb. Sorry about that.
---
All of u commenting on my potato img, I dont have anti aliasis on cuz I'm slightly near sighted so my eyes auto anti alias for me :&gt; turning it ON actually makes the game blurry for me hahahah  
---
I play with all setting on high cept shader on mid
---
When you open the gemstore you can learn that wyvern have 4 legs.
---
I mean, it's not exactly hard to memorize a rotation.  Pressing 8,9,2,5,2,F3,~,4,5,etc isn't exactly rocket science.
---
Seems to be a timing issue from what I've determined here.
---
I'd take it more in terms of: 
---
Charr= US during WW2 
---
Asura=USNC in Halo universe
---
https://soundcloud.com/arenanet
---
&gt; Although I think this was hardly a random decision by ANet's part.
---
People below have now [speculated](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bav5kq/a_full_cgi_add_that_i_didnt_know_existed/eke8wk0/) that it's a reused asset from the cancelled mobile game. That theory, I think, explains this CGI better than my other theory.
---
so what can I do with this information? It seems like I'm stuck on STATE_SERVER_wAIT
---
You're looking at a pug group that asked me to ping when I joined, kicked me when I replied "no", then whispered me telling me I'd be given one chance, and then impressed me with this amazing performance.
---
It was a heal ele...not sure what the engie was though. All I know is they all patted each other on the back after the kill cause they did such a "good job".
---
Not shown: The hours of grinding and days of time-gating to actually *get* all those materials...
---
Sounds like his son is too young, either mentally or physically, to be playing with anybody outside of family.
---
Skipped green 1st phase, did green on 2nd &amp; 3rd phase.
---
Anets focus right now on getting new and returning players interested is great!! Truly it is, but what about the players who’ve been caught up for the last 3 months and have already played through all of season 4? Im really not trying to be negative, but if you have plans to get new players interested, what is your long term plan to KEEP them interested?
---
Well basically composer - Jeremy Soule, while being really great and awesome songwriter is really shit grade businessman, who owns rights for the music that he was hired to compose and could not deliver purchased products to people who payed money. A lot of projects stopped working with him, because he more trouble than composer.
---
except you won't be repeating any missions.  they'll be new missions you haven't done yet.  because they're on different paths (unless they accidentally do a mission on the shared paths before finishing all the ones in the split path for both characters)
---
Why the fuck are you bragging about that? Are you trying to win the prize for biggest asshole on this subreddit? Because sure as hell I would give you that one.

Free Experience Booster this week in the Gem Store!
---
Wow. I have a failed CA log with a DH doing 250 DPS... He said he had Knights gear and that “When I get hit I block attacks”
---
How is it marketing to upload spoilers to their own channel?
---
Jagex clears up inactive account names sometimes in runescape. Said accounts need to have been inactive for years, though, and not been banned. Banned account names are never released.
---
gotta love how charr have devolved to this /s
---
Dude asked what ones I got so I answered lol. And yeah I thought it was funny cuz I was in the guild for two weeks and they gave me access to that.
---
Being that you're also a Soulbeast, how do you feel about the Snow Crows build using dagger and rune of the thief?  Seems like an odd choice.  I've been using dT's build with sword and scholar runes.
---
GW2 pushes "return any time, for free" heavily. They feel it's better to focus on retention of old players rather than on quick turnover of one-time customers. It would be against their core philosophy to delete unused character names.
---
(It was a joke about the quality of the shot that implied that you installed something that downgraded DirectX 9 to DirectX 3.)
---
So, I have returned to the game recently to run through the PvE with two friends, we are not yet sure how far we want to go, nor if we will get expansions (depends if they stay engaged throughout the content). And I have a problem.
---
In the past, I played a Condition Necromancer, but one of the friends wanted that class so I decided to roll with a Ranger. And... so far it is boring. I have already figured out that double bow is a big source of the problem, so I kept Shortbow and got into experimenting with melee weapons to spice things up. But it is not quite working, and for casual running around, melee fighting is bothersome. I have also specced mostly into Traps and Signets, which might also be a problem? I can't quite tell. So far, the only time I had fun was when we fought a Veteran enemy in Queensdale, forcing me to juggle Shortbow and Sword/Warhorn. Partially because it was challenging to stay alive.
---
So, here's my question! Or a few, actually.
---
* Am I just overreacting, and judging the class too early? It is just level 20, sure, but I feel like I had more fun on early level Necromancer back in the day.
---
* Or maybe I just happened to go into the class with a completely wrong, boring build? 
---
* If neither of the two above seem like the main issue, what is a good alternative class here? I am not too fussy, just want something that is actually engaging and active in play. I have been eyeing mostly Mesmer (on the account of uniqueness) and Guardian (because supportive classes are my jam).
---
Thanks in advance for any help!
---
SC build is for raids. You don't have the extra precision from AR conversion like in fractals, so you need the extra precision from Thief Rune to (over)cap crit chance. In raids Scholar runes work fine. Dagger is higher sustained damage, Sword is higher burst. I prefer Sword for the evades and mobility.
---
&gt; Normally when you tell people they are underperforming, you're instantly labeled as an elitist and met with hostility. People don't like hearing criticism about their performance.
---
I have no problem with someone telling me I'm doing low(er) DPS, but shit like, "I'm laughing at this slb's DPS", and shit like that is garbage.  Not to mention kicking when the whole thing went smoothly and quickly.
---
Telling people they're underperforming and offering tips or advice, sure.  Just being pricks about it, no.
---
Well, that "Choose from eight unique professions..." is arguable problematic because it reflects the eight choices for free to play accounts but sounds just wrong.
---
A little off topic but....TIL you can equip the same weapon in both slots. In my defense, I'm usually an Ele.
---
Recent changes have made it better. I'm still salty over meteor storm nerf and sub-floor level DPS for YEARS. The response to this travesty? Make it a melee DPS class with the lowest health cap in the game! That'll fix it! LOL No. 
---
I am glad to see the class get some love lately, though. It's been bad for years. It's time to start fixing the horrible mess they made of it.
---
You live in a residence on a street. To a burglar that’s as much of an open invitation as your twisted logic is in your own case of theft. I hope the one burglar tonight thinks “fuck it, I want that dudes stuff” and robs you blind.
---
&gt; Truly it is, but what about the players who’ve been caught up for the last 3 months and have already played through all of season 4?
---
We just have to wait like 3 more weeks. It's fine.
---
This, this is exactly what GW2 needs! I know it's not the GW2 style, but it still looks great!
---
Carrion Mirage lol
---
I offer my cuddles as tribute! Choose me, oh Great one!
---
I remember watching those videos like 10 years ago. The only thing I managed to do was thumbaround.
---
Mike Z's roadmap post also said there will be a current event leading up to the finale, so we might see that after the 18th.
---
Druid questions. 
---
Background: Been playing two months, leveled to 80 so familiar with the game but not super familiar. Just picked up enough HPs to go Druid (thanks HP train!). Watched some you tube vids, some are really good but they tend to focus on one aspect (raids, fracs, WvW). I have two questions for the more experienced Druids:
---
1) How did you practice your Druidness? Since it's support, and there isn't a lot of grouping in this game (open world), is there a way to practice healing and buffing without being in raid or fractal situations? It would be nice to get a feel for what everything does before getting into situations when its "for real".  I tried being Druidly at some of the world boss events but it was hard to tell if I was helping with the mass of toons out there. 
---
2) When running around just doing normal PVE stuff do you use druid, or do you switch back to a more "normal" leveling style build?
---
Eh... The graphics don't really look like the actual game itself so that's kind of off-putting. It's like "What if GW2, but Unreal Engine?" was made into a video. Kind of feels like a phone game ad, too :V
---
The fact that they're making some kind of advertising for GW2 instead of random stuff with low reach like the beetle car giveaway is a good change though!
---
Played always on gandara and not rly in off hours. There were commanders and raids, but i dont remmember commanders being nearly skilled or people following them in same way as they do today. Fights were slower, people were more defensive, spread out. Never remmember 30+ people staying in same spot and doing everything so organized.
---
I've been playing since day -3 and I rarely have more than 10 gold available at any time. 1.5g is pretty common -- the gold I earn is spent pretty much instantly.
---
/upset
---
Still, they are just examples.
---
The main point of the change is that banners should be more of a suppoort tool and be part of the Tactics line, and longbow a condition damage and fire field tool and be in arms with other condition damage traits, and so a trait from arms would have to go to Discipline.
---
I didn't go in-depths into the specifics of what trait should go to discipline, I just gave an example for reference, as Dual Wielding isn't used very often.
---
only because they're forced to lol
---
Here is more: [Obelix](https://i.imgur.com/EkaKFJo.png), [Jessica Jones](https://i.imgur.com/lpxs4jS.png), [Hellboy](https://i.imgur.com/6TwKvBc.png), [Kratos](https://i.imgur.com/oFOJVgw.png), [Wario, Mario &amp; Luigi](https://i.imgur.com/51j6ftB.png). After this post i have about 30 more cosplays to finish and then i'll post a big list of all of them on both the forum and here, which i will probebly just edit instead of making new posts :)
---
How would new players get spoiled if they haven’t played the episode yet?
---
Your right... 3 more weeks.... and then 3 - 4 more months right after
---
I've tried relaunching the game to no effect sadly, and while the second time I was able to log in on a different character, by then it was already too late.
---
Still laughing at "Palawa, IGNACIOUS, Joko"!
---
I agree with the human female on the right. the left one however is afaik the official artwork of a centaur, therefore it's obvious that there's no outfit/armor representing it ingame.
---
It looked too much like an ad for a mobile game, at least until the dragon close ups started to happen.
---
So, if the new trailer (which is on the game launcher) has any mention of Aurene's current state, someone that hasn't played episode 5 yet will be spoiled of what occurred.
---
I’ve been playing since day -3 and I have found that most of the things I want cost 100s of gold. I have also found that for the most part, you need gold to make gold at any real rate. So for the most part, I maintain a minimum of 50 gold or so.
---
That's your problem then. It's a server that's primarily populated with roamers. It recently got a pugmander that tags up often so you have blobs all the time.
---
Nearly all commanders run away from that server because it's nearly impossible to organize people in there, but it's pretty common everywhere else in EU, where population size allows that.
---
Scourge is better in blobs, but I wouldn't consider any aspect of Scourge challenging. Even in a small group setting, Mirage will likely be as effective, if not more so, than Scourge. Fun factor is subjective, but if you feel more rewarded by complicated outplays, you're likely not going to enjoy Scourge beyond the joy of tagging a ton of enemies.
---
I assume the reason you're deleting is because you're out of character slots? Both just work better in different situations, and keeping both depending on what style you prefer to play would honestly be the best decision.

GW2 has already become that, precisely because of the reasons you mention. Auras, just in general visual clutter. The latest gem store skins always seem like they're trying to top the last in how glowy and shiny they are, if I didn't know any better I would assume that GW2 was one of *those* grindy Asian MMOs.

I very very highly doubt any spoiler of that magnitude will be in the trailer at all. If Aurene comes back to life they most definitely will not broadcast it in the trailer, you’ll have to actually play the episode to find out what happens.
---
This is for those who don't play guildwars2, not for us.
---
1) low tier fractals
---
They're easy going, and aren't terribly punishing for mistakes. That helps you get a sense of watching party health though and managing boon duration. Also, most people at that tier don't expect anyone else to be amazing at that point, so there's less stress about being perfect
---
2) You can stay on druid, maybe switch over your gear to something less healing related, but for most open world PvE things it's not that big of a deal, as long as you're not running something like Minstrel's.
---
Mirage in pve groups is just 10 times better than condi scourge, but scourge (power/hybrid, never condi) is mandatory in every wvw zerg while mirage has no role there. Mirage also favors roaming a lot more than scourge, whether it's power or condi.
---
There's no reason to delete any of them, just make both and play them in different content.
---
Nice! What greatsword is that if you don't mind me asking?
---
Lucky timing for you, the current festival just added a vendor that sells 1 [Tyrian Exchange Voucher](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tyrian_Exchange_Voucher) per week for 16 Bubble Baubles.  These can give you 30 Elegy Mosaics, or other tokens.
---
Brand new human warrior:  what is my purpose?
---
Me: to key farm.

Human Warrior: and then?

---
I mean If the voice over says anything about Aurene's state. If you haven't played episode 5, you don't know what happened to her. It's obviously the biggest topic in the story right now and would very likely be mentioned in the trailer.
---
You can make that 0 HE or so.
---
Excellent.
---
But should I play though the original or start at the expansion... I doubt I remember how the game works haha
---
I'd say keep your mirage and other characters for presents and most of all for variety of play styles so you could switch to something else when you get bored.
---
I have both and both are giving me fun while playing in comparison to base mesmer and necromancer. I saw more scourges who are rather *the basic tool* for WvW nowadays thanks to shades, than mirages who are used more for solo roaming and thus not that visible (at least on my server). 
---
For general pve anything goes - both elites will be fine; in fractals scourge has this advantage that it can be turned into small support with few trait changes and full heal with dedicated gear and traits. Mirage has at the moment only condition gear (and rather nothing will change that judging by this elite nature) but with scarifying 2 skill slots (regular and elite) it can give very small "support"; it's not that popular in fractals but properly managed it's quite helpful.
---
If your watching the trailer for an episode your not on yet... your probably gonna see some spoilers. It happens every time there’s a release, just don’t open the reddit posts that have “SPOILER” in the title, and maybe don’t watch the trailers until your actually on that episode.
---
And let's be frank, his music is great, but it mostly sound the same after a while. 
---
He needs some range.
---
It becomes a grind late game. My info might be outdated because I quit over a year ago but usually an ascended set of armor is around 300G, weapons are like 40-80G, legendaries are a couple thousand gold etc. End game is kinda expensive
---
Ironically -maploadinfo caused infinite loading screens for me. (that and potatoe PC). So I had to remove this command line.
---
Are u brain dead from paying GW2?
---
The expansions start at level 80, and they are noticeably more difficult than the core game. You don't have to create a new character (although you can if you want that new player experience), but I'd play around in the original game first for a while, get accustomed to the controls and mechanics again, and THEN go ahead and do the expansions. The original core game hasn't really changed all that much, some QoL changes, balance patches, some skill changes, etc, but other than that, it's pretty much the same gameplay experience.
---
Better than nothing, but still, could reach deeper into pockets and ask Platige Image to do CGI trailer for them or something.
---
What daily casino purchase you talking about?
---
I don't think the issue would be technological, but cultural. Charr would be a mostly united front. They could be split by legions only in their way to deal with the war. Whereas it would be every Asura for him/her self.
---
Many Asura would simply flee the war. Some would get rounded and slaughtered by the Charr or die due to malfunctions on their own untested weapons of war. Some asura, thought, will decimate the legions on their own. It is fathomable to think that one of the legions would be defeated by just one single genius.
---
In the end, it would be awfull for both sides and it would purge the less capable Asura from their ranks. On the Charr side, many heroes would die honorably.
---
I'd have to think about who'd throw the first stone. If the charr were looking to pick a fight they'd have the advantage, the asura leave themselves wide open by having a way into their capital's core. It'd be over before they even know it. If asura wanted to take down the charr, I think the Charr would be a bit more wary, and have the one gateway protected or be ready to be shelled.
---
If it was started at the same time, and everyone was in their respected cities, I just don't see the Asura doing more than turtling and fleeing. They don't seem very offensive-style fighting kind of people, let alone ones to start a war if they weren't confident they'd have that 100% calculated upper hand.
---
&gt; Not to mention kicking when the whole thing went smoothly and quickly.
---
Just to provide a alternative look at a situation. If a bunch of "elitist" players are kicking some one for low dps either they are a bunch of jerks with unrealistic expectations.... or that persons dps is just so bad the team is already 4manning.
---
there should be some events around PoF maps that give some aswell, iirc i got some from the junundu event in the desolation
---
Level a new character and dont boost. Then go for the HoT expansion. If you care about story watch the season 1 movie on yt and buy season2 from gemstore after finishing the base game and before going for the expansion.
---
Scarf (shoulder), Carapace Jerkin (chest), Mist Walker (gloves), Medium Corsair (legs) and Sneakthief Sandals (boots) :)
---
Kinda was always like that. In the beginning, wvw appealed to the big guilds of players, and anyone who didn't have a guild would just tag along for safety in numbers-- and because loot would follow as well. More objectives, more rewards, more levels, ect.
---
They mean it would be a nice improvement if you could buy 1 per day at the Amnoon Casino.
---
Main difference is what you call "silly" is common practice across anyone who is releasing or unveiling something while also doing an event for something related.
---
So I heard that luck maxes at 300% However...  
---
I had a lot of extra essence of lucks and rather then delete them I consumed them and now the little message says that i am at 302%   
---
Is my luck still going up? is this a bug? did they change the luck cap? what is the new luck cap?
---
What's a karma train?
---
do dailies in wvw for the desert reward track.  I do this every day and I get about 1 skin a month.  Nearly done with the first collection.  In terms of skins/time invested, this is probably the most efficient option.  It will take a long time in real life, but relatively little in game time
---
I love this.
---
would you mind sharing the pieces you used?
---
We might see that tomorrow tbh. Current Events seldom work on the same scheme as LW releases and festivals, except for the whole "added on Tuesdays".
---
The 302% might be your account total, there might be some from achievement thresholds, etc.
---
Alot of animals actually have teeth on their tongue.
---
Quit. Frankly the game just isn't worth a monthly sub fee, I'm still annoyed that I paid full price for this game and all I got was a lousy outfit when the game went F2P. WoW and the FF game can justify it because they are worth the price and that has been their business model from the beginning, they have enough content to justify a sub, although WoW is making some bad decisions, remains to be seen if they'll pull through.
---
Quantity and quality.
---
Yea this makes me really curious as to what mobile game would have been like. Would it emphasize amazing combat GW2 has? The story? We’ll probably never know
---
Waypoints are powered by ley lines, but waypoints can be deactivated or reconfigured from a distance. Taimi managed the latter during S2, and in Orr we have beacons explaining contested waypoints as being temporarily deactivated due to nearby threats being detected. All it would do is register charr as threats and bam, the entire network is unusable.
---
All asura gates are maintained by asura, actually. They hold a stranglehold monopoly on them, be they ran by Inquest or Arcane Council. The only ones they dont maintain are the defunct, inactive, gates from before the asura surfaced, deep underground and surrounded by destroyers.
---
I think the best way to get into it is to buy Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire and play through the Story (in that order) with your favourite class.   
---
I absolutely loved playing these stories while unlocking and discovering my new Elite specialization.
---
As I was playing Heart of Thornes, I unlocked Chronomancer, got used to the shield, learned about the new traits and the new skills.. it was awesome!  
---
Afterwards, I did the same thing with Path of Fire and Mirage.
---
I unlocked other elite specs on other classes afterwards, but I dont know them quite as well, because I had access to the whole thing instantly. 
---
So, if you are patient enough, I believe this is the best way to get into the new content: Story+new elite spec.  
---
Plus: The stories are pretty damn amazing in my opinion.
---
I still don’t see how that makes it any less silly?? I’ve said it like 4 times, people have different opinions, and all opinions as of right now are just speculation and hypotheticals regarding episode 6. How bout we just wait and see what Anet decides to do :P
---
It's a human tendency to bunch up together, so blobs are favored from the start.
---
Then add the fact that in a RvR format, if you are having trouble with some objective, it's much easier to simply add more people to do something, than it is to improve as players/teams. This means that WvW tend to trend towards bigger and bigger blobs, instead of better and better players.
---
Then you have forums and Reddit, where whenever someone asks for advice on getting started in WvW, the most common response is "follow a commander tag". Again, the WvW population trends towards bigger and bigger blobs.
---
And then, you have the accumulation of changes that happened to WvW map mechanics, all of them steadily removing the viability of smaller groups. Those small scale players steadily leave, while the remainder are pushed to join blobs.
---
If you want to have more smaller group action in WvW, you have to petition anet to either introduce mechanics that favor smaller group sizes.
---

My total is higher then that
---
Could just be concept art
---
I agree. Thats more or less what I was saying in my conclusion. They each prevail in tech but on different fields that effectively cancel out any advantage one holds over the other technologically. So it comes down to cultural mindset, which as we both have said, charr are more unified and tenacious for victory.
---
Server wait is usually a high lag/latency ping issue on your end. The map server will only accept your connection if you have low ping, although the launcher connects with high ping.  
---
    
---
I also saw sometimes server_wait issues on mapa that crashed.  
---
  
---
Anyway, your computer doesn’t connect to the server, meaning you know your models and files are correct, what fails is your connection (maybe check firewall just in case, and try to ping to that ip map)
---
Asuras got Glenna, easy win by annoying the Charr to death.
---
Never said anything about whether or not it is silly. I said its common practice. Opinions aside it's what ANet and many, many others do. So ots nore likely to occur than not.
---
Getting the same infinite load screen when trying to play ranked PvP; seems completely random as I've had three games fine (one locked out) whilst my partner has had one game fine (two locked out).  
---
No lag or high ping from my end; 5GHZ, Virgin Media running off the 2AC.
---
*free shit intensifies*
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/the-path-to-the-desert-in-numbers/
---
I generally agree with this assessment.  But there's one factor that I think would tip the balance to Asura: Inquest.  
---
I expect that the Inquest has horrors so profound that the entire world would condemn them.  Tech and monstrosities that they'd never show the light of day - unless their backs were against a wall.  Such as a full scale Charr aggression.
---
&gt; which somehow you couldnt even do because you managed to fail them on the last phase of the fight.
---
Yep, told you I was shit with the balls.  
---
&gt;hat's worse is that you decided to not even run a frost spirit and opt for vulture stance because you can't manage to think beyond the cookie cutter build from a website.
---
Could have easily switched to frost spirit had I been asked, not really any need to when bosses are already melting.  Instead, yes, I ran vulture stance with leader of the pack.
---
&gt; If you're going to complain about elitists, try to not be so arrogant with 17 essences in group asking for more.
---
Wasn't being arrogant.  Said it would be fine.  It was.
---
Wow... How did you make Kratos?
---
10/10, well done!
---
&gt; By searching through reddit I didn't really find a similar post, so I hope this adds some value. 
---
Sorry to say, there is a good reason for that. And the reason is it does not add value. Hopefully you enjoyed typing this up but that's as far as this ride goes. You do have good insights. But unless you work for ANet it doesn't really matter.
---
&gt;you need new blood.
---
Yes but the reason why raids bleed players isn't exactly the difficulty gap though, it's the disgustingly slow release cadence for new wings.
---
Making raids easier doesn't fix this.
---
Raids are easier than ever to get into, with the main region training discord's, guilds to find and video / build guides online. The fights are already at an acceptable difficulty for new raiders so why should they become less difficult than presently?
---
Perhaps if they added a "story mode raid" with no actual boss drops (or a lesser drop item) then sure I'd agree. For now though, the entry level raid difficulty feels good enough.
---
Hi, ranger is my most played class. I highly recommend swapping to sword/axe OR axe/axe. Axe is a ranged weapon on ranger. You can use your 123 to attack at range and use your 4 to pull enemies in range for melee. (eliminates some of the annoyance with having to chase down enemies) Your 5 does a ton of damage and is a reflect.
---
Condition builds are very weak at low levels because you don't have the stats or duration to make them amazing. Also, nothing has enough health for you to build up duration on. Condition builds use shortbow, axe/torch (or dagger if soulbeast), and traps.
---
For leveling on ranger, I recommend axe/axe + greatsword. You get a good mix of utility and movement. Greatsword is also a great defensive AND bursty power weapon. I'd run the signet that grants you power, maybe a shout or 2.
---
Yeah OP is more than mildly full of shit.
---
Who brags about beating DB? The pugs are notoriously bad, most guilds focus EBG wrongfully instead of showing home any attention, leaving it wide open, and there are only a couple serious WvW guilds.
---
This is like bragging about being a good shot after having shot fish in a barrel.
---
Also, screw Herald. That icon was a pain
---
well,we got after  3 years 2 daggers,with most useless skills in game + demented utility ofc,aka pvp spec which was nerfed by 90% at this point =))
---
That's like 3 billion devices runs Java
---
&gt;  At a certain point does it become financial viable to continue making raids if less than &lt;15% of the game population does them?
---
and you only need to look at the state of PvP and WvW to see your own future if you try to go that way
---
I have the original soundtrack CD from the $200 vanilla collector's edition launch tin box. Comes with some art prints as well. Willing to sell you the cd along with the rest of it. PM me if you're interested.
---
I think ffxiv does it the best when it comes to incentivize veterans to help newbies. Everytime you finish a raid with newer players you get additional currency. Raid currency is only relevant in its content ecosystem and having more currencies wont break the economy. If you are worried about more access to ascended stuff theres already enough content that poops them out. I would repeat way more raid content with this
---

Tell me how and I'll make you rich !!!

I got mobile game vibes from this.
---
Argument against - it was never confirmed, announced or hinted; we don't even know if there is expansion team anymore.
---
Do NOT purchase from DirectSong. Jeremy Soule, while a great musician, is a terrible businessperson, and you will never receive the music you buy.
---
Source: ordered 3 GW1 soundtracks and the GW2 soundtrack about 3 years ago, and have not heard a word from DirectSong, despite emailing them follow-ups about it twice.
---
Sure, but when you are outnumbered you will most likely get scouted and countered with bigger numbers from other server. Also, some servers are known to be especially fond of this type of gameplay \*\*when\*\* they have big adventage in numbers, or do it during off-hours, aka nightcappers (looking at you, BB).
---
This is true, I was hoping for some speculative arguments as we have no official info atm.
---
Argument against:  GW3
---
Git gud 👍 
---
Use bond of vigor skill and the 4th mastery from Jackal. Or speed through those zones with the beetle (even the Jackal easily breaks enemy targeting)
---
&gt; I disagree. While they're certainly more advanced in some aspects, they're overwhelmingly inadvanced in others. And military and war is one of those aspects that the asura are not specialized in.
---
The Zaithan campaign would like to have a word with you
---
Do you really think we'll see GW3? Seems unlikely to me.
---
Same for me. Stinks but what can you do
---
that's reassuring since I'm also on Virgin Media (probably should have specified), different hub though. Probably means it's on their end.
---
Honestly I think it looks great.  Love their choice of main Commander here, she's badass.
---
I waited several minutes and it didn't close by itself.
---
I'm pretty new to WvW so reading about all these group strategies is absolutely fascinating. What are some of the best strategies to employ as a zerg commander when outnumbered?
---
&gt; their so called air force is literally stationary floatong buildings
---
who killed Zaithan, again?
---
It seems like they drop more frequently than petrified wood, but it may well just be that the nodes are far more prevalent.
---
i said the number 11 millions isn't wrong. didn't specify if those are people or multiple accounts. the only thing i said is that not all those numbers are playing.
---
&gt; Kaineng is the ugliest piece of shit I've seen in a game for a very long time
---
Well yes, but Jade Sea and Echovald Forest make up for that
---
Well, anwt clearly stated 11 mil players, whichis a lie
---
Best QOL thing they can do to the old wings is add mounts
---
I'd say do the start of PoF to get the raptor with an existing character and start a new toon so you can get back into the mechanics and ground yourself in the world again.  You can use the tomes to shorten the grind.  Mounts and masteries are unlocked for the account, not just the character.
---
Don't forget birthdays are tied to characters so try to sick to your oldest one.
---
1st check your spec:
---
Marksmanship 2-2-1
---
Beastmastery 3-2-3
---
Soulbeast 2-3-2
---
Heal: bear stance or we heal as one
---
Utilities: signet of the wild, sicem, vulture stance
---
Elite: wolf stance
---
Weapons: greatsword and x/Axe (impact/force)
---
Pet is rock gazelle + emergency cc pet on swap.
---
Gear is full berserkers with enough Assassin's for 100% crit chance. For that you need 2995 precision, but you get:
---
420 (fury)
---
100 (banner)
---
100 (spotter)
---
225 (150 AR)
---
So you want 2150 precision. You can get exactly that if you go full zerk in weapons and armor and full Assassin's on every trinket but 1 earring berserker. This number can change if you have overcapped AR.
---
Run sweet and spicy butternut (best food) or avocado smoothie (way cheaper, the DPS diferencie is negliglible but it's account bound).
---
For utility bring sharpening stone and aertherblade pot for the fractals which use it (i used to have all slaying pots and sigils but it's so not worth it).
---
For cm's bring serpent slaying (99) and inquest slaying (100 arkk only). I also have ghost slaying for sirens reef (account bound).
---
If you have legendary weapons or dont mind bringing extra weapons a night/force works in many fractals and dungeons -and it's also better for general pve- and you can also get serpent and inquest for cms.
---
If you are running with renegade + firebrand comp you need to swap some things in your build:
---
As food use curry butternut. This is the same as sweet and spicy but 100 pre instead of power so you will keep your crit chance without spotter.
---
You will also get frost spirit instead of vulture stance, or sun spirit if your other DPS are condi. If running with condi players you also want to run Essence of Speed (middle slb trait 2 instead of 3) and swap slb master trait from stance share (leader of the pack) to oppresive superiority (gm trait 3).
---
Rotation:
---
Start merged, in GS and cast one wolf pack.
---
GS2 &gt; GS5 &gt; GS2 &gt; F3 &gt; Weapon swap
---
Use sic em (and vulture stance if you have it) before the 1st GS2 hits to get all the damage modifiers.
---
Now you just Loop your rotation:
---
Axe4 &gt; Axe 5 &gt; F2 &gt; F1 &gt; autoattack &gt; Axe4 
---
Weapon swap!
---
GS2 &gt; autoattack &gt; GS2 &gt; GS5 &gt; GS2 
---
Weapo swap!  This is the "Loop". Not that hard is it?
---
pro tips:
---
- Don't interrupt Axe 5 not the last Axe 4.
---
- Use your pet F2, F1, and GS3 when available instead of autoattacking (try not to interrupt autochains since it's a dps loss).
---
- use sic em, vulture stance and one wolf stance on cooldown.
---
You want to use SicEn to buff your big damage:
---
GS2&gt;5&gt;2&gt;f3&gt;swap&gt;Axe4&gt;axe5 is the best scenario, but dont wait for that, any 2-3 skills is good enough. Also always F3 when using sicem if you can!
---
GS auto chain has evade in the last attack
---
GS4 is a block with a cc follow up
---
Sword3 is an evade too.
---
Axe 4 is a cc, GS 4,5 and F2 too (but smaller).
---
As for fights...
---
Mechanics &gt; CC &gt; DSP but i guess you know that already.
---
Hope it helps!!!
---
&gt; Would it emphasize amazing combat GW2 has? The story?
---
As any other mobile game, it probably would emphasize the egregious monetization practices :D
---
You know there are gamemodes other than PvE, right?
---
The Pact, which utilizes charr tech modified by human, sylvari, and asura tech combined.
---
No, it wouldn't, because a good portion of the pact's technology finds its roots in charr tech (submarines, choppers, airships), modified by humans, asura, and sylvari (maybe norn too?).
---
As I've addressed elsewhere, most Inquest tend to go too far, too fast, and blow themselves up (sometimes figuratively, often literally). While the Inquest are by far the most advanced in terms of combative might among asura, I do not believe they're comparable to the charr's military. Even with their dragon minion monstrosities that they cannot fully control.
---
Asura would just move away
---
Tbh whole site seems a bit off. 
---
Stuff that just doesn't seem to belong there. Wrongly arranged stuff. Low def.
---
Don't worry, opinions about facts can be wrong. Take flat-earthers and anti-vaxxers for example.
---
;)
---
I was expecting a giant norn Jones. Slightly disappointed
---
If you spent as much time there as you did in Kaineng, maybe...
---
While not as profitable, I appreciate that now the game stops me from trying to waste my life like that. Once a week during some weekly podcast is fine; otherwise, ehr...
---
Thief I guess..  I don't really like any of the medium armor professions. I WOULD love ranger if I didn't dislike all the weapons except for dagger/dagger and longbow
---
That is indeed a cuddle extractor
---
No harm in reporting. If it's a bot, they'll know. If it's not, they'll know, too.
---
Right? My first thought at that final screen was "what the fuck are all of these glowing weapons". Seemed very Star Wars-ish.
---
A thousand times this.
---
What is a "proper new expansion"?
---
No? I don't get what you mean. If you leave your bot AFK farming ranked, then your rating is only representative of the bot's effectiveness.
---
I'm saying that if the player is a bot, a roughly 50% win rate is higher than I would expect.
---
You don't bot for rating. You bot to farm reward tracks and it doesn't particularly matter whether you win or lose or what you know about the game.
---
Lmao how naive are you to think that all burglaries are due to unlocked doors
---
It’s an analogy you donut.
---
I don't think cosplay has anything to do with feelings
---
I think he determines it on the rate

Nice 30 year old boomer there.

#'Record Time: [12 hours 37 minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9xex1x/world_completion_in_12_hours_37_minutes_on/)'
---
Neither can be an expansion team. And considering how zadorojny goes over himself to shill second coming of christ in form of living world, I doubt they even consider expansion anymore.
---
To me an expansion means a decent chunk of repeatable content for every major area of the game - primarily dungeons, raids, new pvp gamemodes, etc.
---
HoT kind of delivered, they added a new PvP gamemode with a bunch of new rewards and infrastructure, a new WvW map, finally added raids, and so forth. They did the bare minimum for these, pretty much only releasing 1 piece of content for each area of the game except for open world, but it was alright. Even the open world had a lot of replayability and increased difficulty (people still do HoT metas to this day).
---
Then PoF happened. Bunch of new maps that are basically leveling maps except you're already max level, very little longevity to them much like the living story. Literally nothing for PvP or WvW, no dungeons/fractals, no new raid. Just a bunch of living story chapters bundled together, and a few extra features. To me that's more like a DLC, not an expansion.
---
I understand where you're coming from, but you need to step back and look at how entitled you are acting to their time. So not only must they accept a lower clear time, but in order to be 'decent' they then have to turn around and spend more of their time giving you tips? Its nice if they do, sure, but not doing so doesn't make them 'pricks'.
---
Sure, that comment can be a bit rude, but its not really when you take into account that you dismissed their requirements, and pridefully claimed it would be fine. Your impression of something going smoothly and quickly obviously did not match theirs. That doesn't make either of you wrong in the open scheme of things, but considering you joined on them when their line was clear, it puts you wrong in this case.
---
As others have stated, the 75 kp is asked for to increase the chance that the players they get A) know what they are doing in each fight mechanics wise (and thus avoid your ball inability) and B) can speed through. Just because you don't wipe, doesn't mean you're actually going as quick as they want.
---
Its like.. and don't take this literally, but like when my toddler wants to help with everything. Sure, as a parent, I let her because its -actually- my job to teach her. The job does get done, and because I am a competent adult, I handle most the work to make sure there is no disaster. Its more stressful, because I have to watch her and make sure nothing goes wrong, teach her at the same time, and it increases the time of it by a long shot. At the end of the day, the chore gets done, sure. But its not as fast as it should be. And they're not your parents.
---
winning every matchup against you =D
---
Always!
---
You would literally only gain a few seconds with mounts in Wing 2 and like 10 seconds in Wing 4. Thats not worth the effort to prevent skips with the mount.
---
While I don't disagree, this would require a lot of QA work to get rid of all the bugs and skips this would introduce.
---
Hi guys !
---
I was always wandering.. In wvw when you use siege weapons, the more you charge the spell 2 (the further it goes) AND the more damages it deals. My questions is : when you’re attacking a keep or whatever and you use catapults just next to the wall, what deals the more damages ? Charging the spell 2 until the max or just casting the spell as quick as possible ?
---
Thank you guys,
---
Nobody said "i'm laughing at this slb's DPS" in the group. The person said he was laughing hard and he was laughing at something being said on discord (he doesn't have a mic).
---
Screenshots of DPS of all three 100 CM bosses were posted. You were greatly lower than the other DPS slot in the group.
---
Nobody called you trash. The only negative thing that was said in party chat was that we told you that you were going to be on balls for Arts and the justification was that your damage was low on Skorvald so we might as well have you do the balls (which you also messed up on).
---
If you asked for help and showed that you wanted to learn, I would have been fine with giving some advice but when asked to ping your essences (we were asking for 75), you pinged 17 and said it would be fine. When we let you stay, it was giving you the benefit of the doubt. After Skorvald, you didn't ask for any advice or anything. After Arts, same thing. We also completed the fractal and everyone got their reward before you were removed from the group because we didn't want to have to deal with the low damage on 99 CM. If we were really actually toxic, we would have kicked you after Skorvald.
---
If you're actually interested in improving and not just posting here to complain, then send me a message and I'll sit down with you for however long you want to go over things you can work on.
---
Don't worry. Doesn't even look like that ingame. No fiery effect. Just some yellow glow.
---
It's literally somebody dressing up to feel like the fictional character.
---
i didn't post on fb o.O?
---
     
---
and i guess counting is difficult, we don't have 50 people on a weeknight. If i wanted to see a bunch of kids circle jerk each other, there's way better places to go than the wvw discord.
---
Might have been the last matchup where we took your t3 garri via pvd the first time, its getting hard to keep track of how many times we've squashed you guys like bugs =D
---
IoJ at least has guilds on it man, DR has 0 players.  So yeah, keep bringing the salt baby &lt;3
---

captured their screen with a mobile phone
---
and we'll see you the week after :)
---
I think this idea Is that during Welcome Back Week 5, they release the trailer as there is no free episode and everyone is caught up, and then it comes the week after.
---
But what we know of the current event coming between that and SAB, it seems unlikely.
---
Except for being posted on facebook 5 days ago...
---
Can you link to this new infographic? I don't see it on the official homepage
---
It goes on sale all the time, so it shouldn't be long until it is again
---
Honestly there is no argument against a 3rd expansion, Just against expecting one after less than 2 years, things take time to develop if you want anything meaningful and dont want to burn people out.
---
What? This definitely a bot. Low rating, mirage (bots tend to be mirage due to low skill people not knowing how to play against it) and a absurd amount of games.
---
Thats what got me to comment in the first place. You ignore time to kill. Is a clear considered good because you kill the raid boss 10second before enrage timer? Or is a arkk kill considered good because it took you 20min? Time is imo a important factor when talking about killing internet dragons and improving your performance in a dps role. Just because you got the kill doesnt mean it was a good kill.
---
There are most like going to be three legendaries dropping with (or near) the next episode (GS, raid ring, S4 accessory), so Mystic Coins aren’t likely to come down anytime soon.
---
You can have 18 active slots but you can 20 infusions 2 of them will swap in and out with weapons
---
They even had shinies
---
If you come in expecting this game to be like WoW you'll probably be disappointed. GW2 is not WoW and it makes an effort to set itself apart from WoW and markets itself as being different. 
---
If you come in looking for something different and fresh you'll probably enjoy it.
---
Healers are definitely welcome in raids and maybe even high-tier fractals and generally work okay for most group activities, my main is a druid healer and I do just fine.
---
I would say you're right... **If**, and only if, the site was actually finalized and publicized.
---
Also, Hitler comparison? Really? Holy Idiotic Strawman Argument, Batman.
---
Thats okay becaus Im not batman.
---
Warrior = Fighter or Barbarian
---
Guardian = Paladin or Cleric
---
Revenant = Blood Hunter
---
Ranger = Ranger(duh) or druid
---
Engineer = Artificer
---
Thief = Rogue or Monk(for daredevil)
---
Necromancer = necromancer Wizard or Warlock
---
Elementalist = evocation Wizard or Sorcerer
---
Mesmer = illusionist wizard, bladesinger wizard, or Mystic
---
Monk(gw1) = divine soul sorcerer or sun soul monk
---
That's a nitty gritty conversion of the guild wars classes to their 5e D&amp;D counterparts.
---
The Crystal Desert reward track is definitely great for completing the Warbeast and Bounty Hunter skins, but it isn't applicable in this case as it doesn't give Funerary armor pieces, which -- alongside Funerary weapons --are what Elegy Mosaics are used for.
---
Why's that? I feel like I'm out of the loop.
---
One type of post I wouldn't mind being restricted to a certain low traffic day or just not allowed.
---
now this is some real tea
---
Hi! I am so glad you found this. It is a brand new CG piece made for our marketing blitz for the next few months. There are quite a few new videos and ads that will be going live. I hope you all enjoy them or at least can appreciate the intention of growing the GW2 community.
---
Would you like to see the other videos?
---
Please don't touch Sabetha. It's the oldest boss and the biggest clown fiesta in bugs after Deimos melee.
---
it started when the survers merged, and suddenly we were sharing a space. he didnt like that we were a group of people having a laugh in one place. and becuase we refused to go somehwere else, he has a grudge. idk, its really petty.
---
Coins are expensive for 2 reasons:
---
1- Legendaries being released.
---
2- They are used for selling/buying runs (long ago it was ectos but since their price dropped a lot they stopped being useful). Prices are kept more or less stable with a +/- 7 silver up or down during the week for this reason (with a little spike when a new legendary is released).
---
The limitation for SAB to only exchange 3 per week has made the impact negligible. The MC daily also has barely any effect.
---
If nothing changes the next price down will be when the bazaar of the 4 winds festivity comes in the summer since the event lets you get MC without much limitations. Last year price went below 1 gold a piece.

Huh it's the raft level animation, for some reason playing when that player is not on the raft.
---
thats what confused us. hed never had a soft ban etc, ever. then suddenly a permaban. it was weird, and anet wouldnt answer any questions about it.
---
Speak for yourself, I’d hope for an expansion at most every 18 months. My guild has virtually dropped off the planet because of how slow Season 4 has progressed with no new XP on the horizon.
---
Woo! Thanks for this! This is more helpful than you might realize ;)
---
Both accounts are brand new redditors.
---
I still wouldn't dismiss troll(s).
---
My bet is that the S4 trincket will be an amulet since the ring is going to be the raid one.
---
Im getting an auron ffx vibe i dig it
---
hiya, i cant find that ticket number, but  Ticket #7179778 is the one with all the info.
---
It could even be 5 if anet wants to follow the tradition with 2 versions of the legendary greatsword that can combine into a 3rd one in ther MF :P
---
In any case i'm not sure the next raid wing will be released at the same time as the S4 last episode.
---
Please show us or upload the other videos! I *totally* loved this CGI video
---
Wow i do such an unefficient route, even what you don't label as shortcuts are a huge improvement over my actual runs.
---
im a new rediter yep. i was advised today to come here and seek some help. xx
---
Yes please
---
Awesome. I'm trying to bide my time, though I may end up buying before a sale if I continue at my current pace.
---
I mean, they didn't specifically say 11 million players.
---
Nice! What colors are those you are using on dyes?
---
The manipulation they are pulling here is obvious and on new f2p site linked in this thread they litetally say 11 mil players
---
Sure, it's true that even just swapping numbers around can introduce bugs. However, a reduced complexity also results in a less error-prone implementation.
---
The point I'm trying to bring across is not that we just need better loot, but rather that we need a twist on the content to make it more interesting. As the concept doesn't sustain itself, improved rewards are also necessary to provide an initiative to the players.
---
I'm going to let you decide which live action ad to show right now.  Choose between "HALFTIME", "BAND" or "HEIST"
---
Love it. Thanks for sharing!

*Half Time*

Yes, we really need these types of videos to go public. This type of advertising is what MMO players generally expect.

---
 7212224  latest ticket, as i have been following the advice you gave me.
---
Please note that I'm suggesting alternative challenge modes, leaving the normal mode encounters untouched. I mean it's in bold up there, what else can I do..
---
Don't play condi scourge in wvw, the damage is significantly lower than power.
---
If you need a build and guide for wvw scourge:https://youtu.be/YVdg0eV_Kfg
---
Ff14 doesnt do it right at all... you already max on currencies easily, and weekly/total caps are just a fucking awful system
---
Thank you
---
That was hilarious!
---
You'll get access to them eventually, just in a few years.
---
There are litterally hundreds of other skins though, and I'm sure you'll find some you like better.
---
My personal favorite.
---
Wanna see another one?
---
But now I wonder 2 things. 
---
1) When will they release this CGI trailer to the public? 
---
2) When will we have the episode 6 trailer?
---
Sure! Show me any unlisted video randomly
---
It's amazingly done - this is way better marketing than meme'd "AAAAAAH" but there are two things that make this bit odd: weapons are way bit too glowy and asura ears are more of Dumbo or Eeyore type than asura we're seeing in game
---
1. This week across the globe
---
2. When it's ready ;-)
---
But they did that ”reset“ with Gw2 already. They can’t just create a new game to reset every time. Look at other games &amp; I hate saying that but look at WoW, still releasing expansions and it’s still the same game for years.
---
There shouldn’t be a need for a reset or gw3 because Gw2 is perfect in terms of mechanics etc, all they need to focus on is deliver better and more frequent content.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sNIj7Rf0UY
---
Superior Rune of Sanctuary Is a popular choice that works well in certain stituations as well.
---
I still think they're fucking lying when they say that shit
---
plottwist! these where actually the trailers for the new mobile game, but since those got canceled you know .... just pretend there where for gw2
---
Okay, spammed you with a bunch of request, all of them fulfilled, and I'd like to thank you for sharing!
---
Every single one of these is great.
---
And! Am I crazy or is the dwarve voice actor talking at the Hoelbrak video?
---
ok thnkyou. i will continue to do as asked. xx
---
What tradition? That happened literally once.
---
I just want a horse
---
I am no longer part of this guild, I manage mine and I work for several US and American guild
---
Working as intended
---
Huh, 'work for'. Impressive.
---
Lol this happened to me yesterday. Not sure why but it's pretty annoying. I had to relog every time I got struck with that bug. Nothing has happened so far since that situation... Thankfully.
---
This is a great reply, but I'd just add that re: living story chapters, yes I'd recommend getting them to play through the story of it and for trinkets, but you don't have to buy them. You can play through the story of S2 if you have a friend who owns it since the maps come with the core game (although you won't get any rewards/achievements), and you will need to buy S3 and S4, but you DON'T need to buy them with real money, you can unlock them with gems you convert from gold if you'd rather, so that content isn't any sort of financial commitment. 
---
So basically yes get the living story stuff you missed but it won't cost you any real money.
---
A small note, a lot of power classes still deal “accidental” condition damage. Having that small condi damage bit does help boost dps...
---
RIP /u/polarbytebot
---
Thank you. Thank you. I want to make my passion known and show that the halls are not useless proof
---
Sanc runes were opaf for like a week too. They triggered off of scourge’s ability to cleanse a condi when they apply barrier. So broke!
---
I favor vamp runes in wvw myself on scourge =3
---
Recreate the Thermanova Incident as a bomb, ez asura win.
---
Whatever the comments below me are, if you're new to pvp you won't experience the lack of content, i've been playing this game for more than 6 years and 90% of that was pvp, i still enjoy the game mode on a daily basis.
---
Actually, it did shake up for a few classes. Scourge takes Lich now, pslb takes thief... went from 4nightmare/2trapper to 6 nightmare. It shook it, but yeah not much.
---
Enough to give it a sense of freshness imo. Plus the BD rune options are nice now! Leadership/Radiance/Water all offering the same BD%
---
&gt;in World vs. World mega-battlesand
---
Missed a space there (even if the page isn't advertised anywher yet)
---
You can't.
---
Most likely including alts.
---
Something that gives power and precision/ferocity/condi damage would generally be a good pick.
---
This is actually super cool to see in action.
---
yeah dude
---
I read in the dev post that they are planning more horizontal progression. Do we know how will this be implemented?
---
fuck yeah
---
They won’t have a way to differentiate between mains and alts. If they tried those numbers would be skewed just as incorrectly in the opposite direction.
---
And this is how we got Brexit
---
Also, as a side note: the dragon logo animation in the end of the videos you linked looks low-definition and pixelated. It won't be for many viewers, but for techies/nitpicky ones like me, that feels jarring and gives off a "amateur-made, unprofessional" vibe. Content aside, it's quite surprising to see such a technical mistake.
---
So you mean i get about 100 diffrent stats for my information after a game, but i can't look them back up? Why is this the case?
---
Having 170 condi dmg on a class that does around 500 condition damage is not that significant though. Most of the time bosses have phases as well where they lose them
---
From https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/celebrating-six-years-of-guild-wars-2/ (Aug. 2018)
---
&gt; Getting the most bang for your buck.
---
Buy Season 2, Season 3, and Season 4 Episode 1. You'll probably have enough gems left over to get an infinite salvage kit of your choice.
---
Season 4 Episode 2 is free until the end of today. It's on the gem store. Season 4 Episode 3 will be free from tomorrow until next Monday. Season 4 Episode 4 will be free the week after that. Season 4 Episode 5 is already free, as it is the latest episode and you always get the latest episode just by logging in.
---
&gt; Should I buy the LW Seasons?
---
Yes. They're actual content, as opposed to items that save you a tiny bit of time.
---
Season 2 has less content sure, but I'm a sucker for actually playing all the story content because the quality gets quite good, and you would need the backstory to appreciate that.
---
Even from a pure gameplay perspective without Season 3 you're missing 6 entire maps. You can never get to them without owning it. 
---
You have 4000 gems, it would be stupid not to get them imo.
---
&gt; Should I boost
---
The answer to new Players is always no. To You, it's a bit more complicated.
---
If you don't mind "Wasting" half a boost, here is what I personally would do:
---
Start a new character. Play and level normally until you get a feel for the game, probably around level 40. At that point make the decision to boost or no, but it will probably be to boost.
---
Most major systems have been completely redone since you last played.
---
&gt; How long to get a mount
---
Going in order? Probably 70 or 80 hours for the raptor.
---
Skipping ahead? 10 minutes.
---
Do the first story step of Path of Fire and you're given a raptor. Other mounts are much further into Path of Fire.
---
I voted Krexit because of those bloody Charrs who be stealin me job
---
If you are short on budget just slap your ele zerker gear on a reaper. They have good cleave and burst and an easy rotation. Others have given you good examples for other classes you could gear as well.
---
Playing thief early hot was harder than dark souls.
---
It's pretty reminiscent of some of the old SWTOR CGI ads.
---
Most of it makes sense, you just have to get the joke.
---
Seaon 4 won't end tomorrow. In 4 months it's two years.
---
It would be interesting to know how much money Anet earned with PoF and how much with gemshop sales in release quarters. PoF peaked with roughly double the revenue of a non release quarter. 
---
But it was probably a lot more work - and much more expensive - to develop. For Anet non release quarters might be more profitable. A team of, lets say, 100 people working for two years on an expansion is very expensive. You need to earn millions just to cover their salaries. I wouldn't be surprised if Anet needs to sell one million copies just to cover their costs for developing an expansion.
---
what do you mean by that?
---
haha this is weirdly cute i like it
---
For example the skip in Wing 1 before the spirit run. If mounts would be added this skip would also return.
---
I really appreciate the effort put into those vids (can't wait to see more). One question. Can we hope for a CGI trailer in style of the Guild Wars Factions one for future content under your rule as HoGM? Let's say for Season 5 or a potential expansion 3 someday? That trailer is still one of my favourite video games trailers ever and would love to see more of this.
---
I want a guild hall just to do stuff like this.
---
I am part of VIP but the guild is a little too big for me, I'm still doing Tequatl &amp; TT daily for ascended. But anyhow, i just thought a huge tank mount would be awesome but i'll grind to get Bond of Vigor, there's just too many things to grind for atm.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
All I can say is marketing wise...more is coming.
---
boons are applied and condis removed in a certain radius.    
---
The group that is tighter also mitigates more damage as skills only affect a given number of targets.    
---
As WvW players became more experienced, the blob ball was the natural evolution of play.
---
