Every single one of your arguments has been easily countered at this point, and yet you continue to grasp at straws making very weak arguments.

items do rotate in and out of the gem store, it's just that we never really know when they'll be available outside of the themed holiday ones.

Raper is powerful as AOE DPS.

Sounds like they can more easily update and fix the API now without fearing for old apps. That's awesome!
---
"I don't need toxic people in a game i play for fun"
---
Especially not when the rest of the server shares this attitude or at least is willing to follow someone like this.
---
The gem store rotation is all up to anet, we can expect items to rotate back in or have some other option to get them ([statuettes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Statuette) for instance) but we don't know when that will be. [This old thread](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/gw2/Gemstore-items-new-sales-discounted-prices) recorded gem store sales and changes and it looks like they are continuing it on [this new thread](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/458/news-gemstore-items-new-returned-sales). [GW2Timer also has a section](http://gw2timer.com/?page=Account&amp;section=Gem) to set alerts when a specific gem store item is on sale or available again.

No, I didn't, I just addressed a single individual in a single instance.

Lmao
---
Sorry sir

How rude!
---
Thank you for your hard work! WvW is alot better with this! 
---
Goddamn. GW2 sprites in the FFIV style?
---
Time to download RPGMaker again.
---
Well it depends what you enjoy more. Dps? Ele rev or scourge could be good. I'd say scourge is easier of the 3 and very important is large scale fights. Rev seems harder but maybe just me since I only run zerk on my rev. Ele is prolly hardest since you are likely gonna get 1shot a lot until you learn how to position.
---
If you like support you can play firebrand or scrapper or even chrono. Firebrand is rather easy and it's the heart of every party group thanks to all the stab and aegis it provides. Scrapper is probably easiest but offers ridiculous amounts of heals, condi clear and boons. Chrono is still okay as well but most veils, portals, pulls and grav wells. Tempest been seeing a bit play as well as a support class, but auras are still pretty underwhelming so idk...
---
Another good class is spellbreaker since domes are pretty OP again in this patch. Can be dmg or utility oriented so some flexibility there. Can even try running banner I see some ppl still use it sometimes, can be useful.
---
My 8,5k hours since launch says hi
---
What is that item you were inputting?
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...

Not entirely either, I believe they should be able to post options that they chose, as the PvP titles seen here for voting. The options are still entirely controlled by them. Though I of agree with PvE voting drowning WvW and PvP which makes it the hard part. However things like, ideas for the new map? Or maybe a new item for skins? I don't see why not.  
---
Well of course you'll run out of content if you play the game 24 hours a day for 6 years /s

I thoroughly enjoy playing rev (sword/sword shiro roamer or hammer backline with glint). Jack of all trades
---
Wtf I just bought adoption licenses like 3 days ago ☹️
---
If you're doing raids, either works, but most encounters prefer condition builds (although some, often those with many short phases, like Keep Construct or Slothasaur, prefer power builds, and some in MG need SB's boon strips). Fractals tend to prefer power builds, especially if the instability needs SB for boon stripping, but condi builds can be good in long boss fights. In open world and story, you can obviously do either (I prefer condition berserker myself). Finally, WvW prefers power builds, both for burst damage and for SB's boon stripping and elite skill.
---
Either way, I'd probably craft Berserker's armor if you're going ascended, partially because you can stat swap them easily enough with an exotic inscription, and the Viper's ascended inscription requires fulgurite, while the exotic Viper's and both kinds of Berserker's inscriptions don't. That, and you really only need ascended armor for fractals, since even raids are fine with exotic armor, and fractals prefer power builds anyway.
---
I am not into this dense roleplay anymore
---
Thats really unfortunate that noone gave u a helping hand
---
Just a quick answer, a breakbar is a blue bar under the boss'es enemy health bar. You can also cc players with stability and stun them.
---
The abilities that break stun bar are usually thte ones that have immobile, knockdown, chill, fear, and so on. And in that case when someone asks for cc on enemy or if u see the blue bar, its best that you know your class'es skills beforehand so that you are prepared

Don't get taco marks until you tried it your self first. Those marks are for daily jumpers and those that feel tribulation mode is too annoying. But don't spoil your fun with markers first thing.

8/8 bait by Zommoros

The API team has always been extremely communicative. 
---
Now you can go through and update your route.  I think there was a few bauble locations you missed last year?  Been a while so I don't remember if you updated those.
---
Did....did you just NSFW a plant?
---
Ehhhh?  This reminds me of the live streams they did 3 years or so ago showing people how to level.  Devs were literally walking around starter areas and doing map completion.
---
There needs to be more for veteran players.  Show me a new map different than any before, or a new guild mission, or a raid like instance for 20 people.  Then I'll talk to my friends about coming to play the game with me.  I don't think they will want me to say, "Hey, Anet is showing us map events on stream!  We should go do them!"
---
SAB MOUNT SKINS! (i still have hopes up that maybe this year we get a Beedog skin and bunny or bunado skin)
---
I mean its great, but it still doesn't say anything about whether those players will have to pay the 200 gems for each episode. If so, it's essentially running an event for their shop.
---
Longbow is a condi weapon, and GS is power, you probably better off choosing one or the other
---
not really, feels like almost 7 years ago
---
How does that make him a scumbag when he it is an open world PvP mode?
---
Also, the zerg and roaming build differ like 2 utilities.
---
is there a reason you are posting a 10 months old video? missing the context here.
---
Just like Wintersday is mostly karma oriented and New Years luck oriented, SAB rewards are focused mostly on skins and achievements. Ignore the guy telling you to install taco - definitely don't do that right away. Just hop in and explore and look up a guide if you get stuck. There are weapon skins that can be earned and/or dropped from the chests at the end of each level. Baubles, the currency, can be traded for upgrades in the SAB world and for some stuff at the vendors. The vendors are in Rata Sum year round so you can go check them out whenever. It's by far my favorite thing in the game, but Tribulation (the hard mode) is not for everyone. I've farmed it for all the skins, but a lot of people struggle to even finish it once so don't burn yourself out.
---
Ah, I did read something about that while back. All right, thanks.
---
Is that you steve?

Some Risen can reproduce, though. [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Champion\_Risen\_Spider](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Champion_Risen_Spider) are constantly producing new eggs, which hatch into Risen spiders.
---
I don't think you understand that some people play games *for fun* and don't care how WvW works because WvW is unfun bullshit.
---
It's really something else the first time through!
---
Oh man! I'd like this so I can at least learn Engi rotation on a DPS golem just get it down. Thank you!
---
Soloing dungeons is not a very easy task, regardless of class. You need to know your class as well as the dungeon inside-out or you'll have a very hard time soloing it. Posting a group on lfg will make it a lot easier.
---
The fastest way of getting currency is combining dungeons with pvp and/or wvw reward track since dungeon rewards reset daily.
---
You cant level in wvw but you can get tomes of knowledge which you can use on your alts.
---
Key farming is a gamble, it can give you expensive skins or some good QoL items which you can either keep or sell, but it can also give you some trash that you dont even need.
---
NCSoft to Blade and soul players "Here have a free max level boost and tons of decent gear so you can jump straight back into the game."
---
Anet to GW2 players "Welcome back, we have nothing to show or give you but please come back."
---
No amount of guides and livestreams can hide the fact that WvW and PvP are struggling. But at least there appears to be some kind of effort again. 
---
I just started playing a month ago, so help from something like this will be appreciated
---
There are not many dungeons you can solo tbh. just look for a group and run them.
---
For many encounters you need 5man.
---
&gt;icexy
---
Was in fractal yesterday and one of the group dps told me that i have the lowest dps, im not sure what he meant since im a healer. So i got confused and wonder whether a healer should do good amount of damage as well.
---
Nice.
---
??? 
---
What even is this?
---
If you want to make people try the game or bring them back to it, you need to actually do something to entice them. A level boost, A costume, An ascended weapon... Idk. 
---
I just don't see how this is supposed to bring anyone back, A random post on official forums stating that you're streaming? This won't even get covered by other websites because it's quite literally not news.
---
Which dungeons? Some paths can't be soloed or take too long which drastically reduces the reward for effort. Plus each dungeon path only gives rewards once per day. Fastest way to get a particular token type would be doing each path once a day in a Lv. 80 group, then spending extra time doing the WvW track. If you want to do multiple dungeons at once, you get an extra 5 gold and 150 tokens of choice for every 8 different paths completed which is a good added bonus.
---
WvW has changed a bit; you get Tomes of Knowledge from running it which are level PvE boosts that can be used on any character.
---
Key farming is a bit of both? Depends on what drops and if you'd rather use it or sell it. You can only do Lv. 10 keyfarm once per week on your account so it's not super profitable, just a nice (almost) free roll.
---
I only have 16.400 hours or so!
---
We can't assume she said "stalking" to anyone, even as a joke, we weren't there, the guy could have probably just gone full white knight without her saying a thing. That's something that can happen too, because some people think women are delicate flowers that can't stand up for themselves. 
---
But yeah I agree, this kind of behavior really harms the true victims in the end.
---
* Tequatl got bits and pieces rotten away.
---
* Glint was born female from his father Kralkatorrik. We do not know how that works or if there was even a mother.
---
* Vlast was born male from an egg laid by Glint.
---
This is what I'm leaning towards too. But it doesn't explain Glint since she was a construct of Kralkatorrik.
---
Best I've seen is on sylvari female medium armor
---
Agreed. I don't think this stuff is thought about that deeply by devs, but I will say this. Creating an undead dragon from scratch would probably be an it. It's possible Kralky intended to create a female, since we know she can give birth. Just a thought.
---
Hilarious.
---
I'm not a huge fan of the plebs ganking other plebs that can't even fight back. But that's because mobility creep already allowed them to choose only fights they wanted, and avoid any even or risky fight just like mounts do for everyone now.
---
But the way you want a PvP mode to work is some of the most carebear shit I've ever read, and I've been playing GW2 for years so that says something. No matter what anet do; the weak will be picked off first. That's how open world PvP works. They're weak and bad and they will die before everyone else. 
---
And unless they improve, they'll continue to die first. It doesn't matter if you put them in a group, make them solo roam or have them go PvP. By definition the worst players are at the bottom of the food chain, getting picked on by anyone and everyone. A dodge wrong with their zerg, walked into any other roamer that happened to be better, had the attention span of a goldfish and whoops, dead on teh floor again. The gamemode will ALWAYS be hostile to players that can't actually fight anyone. THAT IS HOW OPENWORLD PVP WORKS. 
---
Now the ONLY actual thing you can do to IMPROVE this, is by ensuring "wolves" and "sheep" aren't forced to play on the same servers and in the same matchups 24/7. Which means you get elitist servers and elitist matchups where good players play against eachother; and sheep servers where casuals play at a lower level without constantly getting farmed by whatever guild has nothing better to do. 
---
But if you suggest that, all those sheep go full tilt because "that's going to be elitist and toxic and we won't get into the best servers reeeee". No shit, that's the point. 
---
So please - except for having matchups and servers split based on skill in some way - how do you suggest anet designs the game so it's /not/ punishing for new players and bad players going into PvP? Adding ridiculous tools like this mount doesn't help them long term; it just gives better players more tools to abuse against them (and by definition, they will use these tools better than the bad players will). 
---
Openworld PvP is by its very nature hostile to newbies and bad players. WvW depopulates by anet TRYING to bring more non competitive players into WvW, which ragequit within weeks because they don't want a challenge. They want to be told they're amazing when the truth is their gameplay is pretty awful. 
---
Personally - I agree at this point the skill difference is too massive to even make a difference. It's hilarious how far ahead some groups are over random pugs and new players. It's also depressing to see how far behind some 10k rank players and groups are... But considering these players it doesn't suprise me. 
---
The only thing you can do to fix this is by bringing competition back, and having weaklings and new players start at the bottom (but also compete against other bottom tier players); while having the best players on top (and not forced to play with the newest players; against another mixed group unable to ever increase their level but rather forced into a perpetual state of teaching and carrying plebs). 
---
are you talking about wow? if so that's absolutely false, they add 1 toy per year and thats it
---
Deroir'ed is the JP incident a couple of months ago:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8w3q4n/must_be_a_thrill_to_work_with_this_dev/
---
You know, the one where a guy asked a woman a question about something directly related to her twitter posts on GW2 and she immediately accused him of sexual harassment.
---
it's likely given the other things she was saying to the OP that she accused him of stalking to her friends, it doesn't look like any of the idiots he was against had 2 brain cells between them, i don't think the white knight would have known unless she said something to him or something where he could see it
---
I'm confused, what's #2 supposed to be?
---
"Found Nightfall at a Thrift Store"?
---
As far as we can tell based on previous experience, "the next one".
---
Dragons are stronger, but there's no real way to rank them among themselves. 
---
Kormir stated that the gods left because if they didn't, they'd either be eaten or inadvertently destroy the world as they fought. And since the gods can use strategy, teamwork, cleverness, and more, and *still* not think they'd win, this means the dragons are definitely stronger. They made their home in Orr, on top of sleeping Zhaitan, because they thought it was just a bottomless font of magic that they could use.
---
I think herald is really forgiving. You can provide benefits while learning how to smash them with your hammer!
---
Not good for griffon.. maybe plains of Ashford
---
Special Instance, Pact Captain, explains various mechanics. Includes: interrupts, stun breaks, proper stomping, proper escapes from stomping, mountains, CC bars, using CC to herd mobs to locations e.g. against the wall, off a node.
---
It differs even greater for other classes like Scourge Guardian Ele.
---
It's clear that his idea of roaming is just hunting people who aren't built to duel and roam.
---
And he is  complaining about mounts which is a good form of protection for people who don't wanna fight and rejoin their zerg.
---
Roaming isn't limited to hunting people who are leaving their spawn, it also includes flipping camps, and taking objectives around the map behind enemy lines.
---
If yu meet other roamers who contest the camp then that's when fights happen.
---
This guy however thinks roaming means running around picking on people who don't wanna fight and blames mounts for protecting them.
---
Like that's some next level scumbag thinking.
---
If he were complaining that " hey it's ridiculous how much mobility it is, roamers can't take camps easily now because people reach to defend faster on mounts" I would agree, yea mounts kinda killed roaming because I myself as a roamer have encountered problems of enemies contesting my camp from their spawn in matter of seconds.
---
But within the first minute he straight up tells people he wants to kill people who aren't even looking for fights.
---
well we have next to no info on steve other than forcing the quaggan and krait out of the sea
---
mordy is dead
---
zhaitan is dead
---
primordus is physically the largest (unless steve is an absolute unit), its minions are a consistent threat geographically due to originating beneath the earth (being corruption of the earth and rock itself; they also have the capability of self replication)... but asleep for now so barely relevent
---
jormy has massive swathes of claimed territory so unlike primordus its 'strength' is more visible; due to primordus being underground and such its hard to compare the two; prior to LWS1 i believe the widely held conscensus was that jormy is the most obviously powerful; but thats just whats visible (also changed greatly)
---
kralk is obviously the most powerful currently; not only is it awake but having absorbed spectrums of other dragons magics along with some (the majority) of balthazars; kralk is literally so powerful it rips reality apart... so atm the strongest
---
in PoF kormir seemed to imply that the gods *could* kill the dragons, and balthazar sort of half proved that (i mean, he did hijack a bunch of primrose and jormunganders power) but also knew it would be disastrous... also its fair to say that current kralk is leagues more powerful than the kralk she and the other gods evaluated; so up in the air
---
I used to be skill clicked in early days is gw1. Still miss those days.

Tfw we want QoL reworks, better balance, content revamps, repurposing over a dozen unused currency

---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=gw2+break+bar
---
and a god...kinda.
---
The headline made me think they rehired everyone that got fired. 
---
The part he didn't mention is that different types of CC will do different amounts of "damage" to the break bar.  Stuns will knock out a big chunk, while things like snares will only do a little. 
---
Artistic literary cohesion.
---
no problem! That's what I do/did to learn :D
---
What's that command?
---
Honestly this opinion is very assumptive and isn't backed by anything factual. 
---
2v2 isn't as comprehensive as Conquest. 
---
The balance for 2v2 is non-existent and isn't planned, they didn't even change any balance for 2v2 when it was released as a temporary tournament. 
---
2v2 is very samey and leads to a very consistent meta, atleast it did when it was in effect. Firebrand and Scourge. Firebrand maintained the output until 2 minutes, then provided power damage and CC post-2 minutes whilst the Scourge provided barrier (which didn't count as healing) to the group.
---
In some cases, groups without a firebrand were waiting for post-2 minutes just to get damage done and potentially win into the sustain comp. 
---
Scourge always came out on top. 
---
ArenaNet already take 3 months to adjust Conquest as it stands. Imagine if you introduce yet another game mode (or more importantly, replace an existing gamemode which has structure and balance) which has no balance and requires an extensive on-going balance in order to be playable.
---
I think introducing 2v2 and removing conquest in one fail swoop would kill the PvP scene altogether, even if you released it with a '*huge balance patch*' it'll still be uncertain how it continues into the future and that's a chance ArenaNet wont take when they're currently happy with the state of the game. 
---
I think designing some in game event that does this would be better. Or updating the lv1 experience to teach them all the important mechanics of the game. 
---
Ugh, one my least favorite gw2 festivals I usually take a break from the game for the duration of this bullshit.

Ok, I'm curious now. o_o Sorry about the chain-crits to your reddit inbox lol.

**Brand new game: veterans thrown under the bus**
---
I believe that what makes a healthy game is a balance of new players and veteran players. We obviously don't need to mention why a game needs new players. But why do we need veterans? Because we are the only crowd in the game who can tell the devs objectively why we care about the game. When the devs keep trying use methods to attract new players at the cost of vaternas

**What is Coop?: single player mode**
---
**Reward structure: do more for so little**
---
**Delusional cash cow: buy my junk**
---
**Pitfalls of theme park: neverending carnival**
---
**MMO: dying genre**
---
I can write all the long but theses are the most prominent reasons that reflect a portion of the gw2 community as of March 23, 2019.
---
WvW is PvP. it has PvE, but that PvE aspect exists only to give context and facilitates the PvP parts.
---
the moment that PvE start interfering with the PvP aspects, then there's something wrong.
---
or in other words, WvW is PvP &gt; PvE.
---
Super Adventure Festival (SAF) = Super Adventure Box (SAB)
---
Nice since I just came back and was a little overwhelmed. 
---
The original plan was indeed to have 4 full worlds to SAB added over time.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Well, the second plan. The original plan was to have world 1 be a one-off thing, but popularity made World 2 a thing. Then they scrapped it because some bug got added into the system that made playing it unplayable until they fixed it years later.
---
World 3-1 already exists, partially, but isn't accessible. Even if we only get 1 zone a year, that's hardly "as big as a LS episode", but would be more akin to a Freezie raid added every year.
---

....you mean weaver....
---
Meh.  This is definitely a net loss to loot rarity across the board because mathematically speaking MF just got fucked out of existence.  It wasn't really present before but now it's even less.  
---
Big picture I'm wary of how this will affect income and progression between min-max grinding players versus regularly playing players that aren't gaming the system for max loot(because let's face it, GW2 is an ungodly grind for anything other than up to exotic equipment).
---
Not a fan at all.  Great quality of life change, absolutely terrible for the fucking market.  
---
I believe that what makes a healthy game is a balance of new players and veteran players. We obviously don't need to mention why a game needs new players. But why do we need veterans? Because we are the only crowd in the game who can tell the devs objectively why we care about the game. When the devs keep trying use methods to attract new players at the cost of veterans, the community loses faith (yes, even the new recruits), and we'll unapologetically walk away. Ex. Joining multiple guilds at HoT (no more 100% rep for guilds, resulting in commanders leaving), server matchmaking/bandwagoning, esport fiasco... Etc.
---
When someone writes a very objective and well-written post about a suggestion/recommendation in the official gw2 forum, 8/10 gets banned and people come to Reddit to repost. The 2/10 are *kitten* YouTube kissassers (all my respect for them). I guess initially they were kissassers, now slowly steering into the butthurt veteran pile (see first point). Pmuch if you haven't done initial kissassing, well you're screened out.
---
After the horrible underdelivering of HoT with overpromising and failing *cough* Colin Johanson (you will not be forgotten, pity the dude really), Mike O'Brien cut all community to maybe 10%. At first, the community liked the approach of 'announce only what will deliver' but as the announcement gets later and later without any explanations, the community gets frustrated by the minute. Sure, they are people too, well, least act like one. The community is actually more "we're okay if you fuck up, so tell us what's going on" and anet be like "no, I'm a pussy, I ain't tellin you nothing" and get burned harder in the end for 1.) Not telling and 2.) Fucking up
---
It's totally impossible to keep up all 3 game modes, I'll just be very frank. Not even an exaggeration, each game mode is a game in and of itself. Then one must treat it as such, not throw 10 people to make raids, 5 in fractals, maybe 2 on WvW and another 3 for PvP (numbers are hypothetical to prove a point). No kidding you have set yourself for failure, moreso a dumb move to send the most experienced devs to work on other apps that isn't gw2 (laidoff not before long).
---
It's not anets first time to give exactly the opposite to what the community has been asking for years (yes YEARS). Community wanted no multiguilding (oh, did you mean you wanted it? Ok, here). Community says need WvW restructuring for balance (last thing on the list, hello~~ new mount), fix PvP post HoT (they go on esports and throw away cash), you get the idea.
---
Way back in the day, we asked for more dungeons. MMO dungeon crawler was the shit, dungeons were end game and rewards were appropriate. They couldn't do it for some odd reason and focused on story instead.. anet plz.. replayability. Hence, came the abominable map currencies, seasonal currencies are better but map tied farmable currencies are horrible as always (very overwhelming for a new player to check out the wallet lol). There was once I took an hour to explain all of the currencies to a new player.
---
Anets attempt to make Skyrim but not so Skyrim. People may most likely agree that season 1 and 2 had the best Coop esque experience, just that the design was so terrible it was better to have some teammates. Coop was manageable for HoT, and LS S3 leading up to PoF Then came the ridiculous PoF story. Story wasn't bad but try to play it with a friend and your friend is on spectator mode and is useless on some instances. It's true they didn't wanted to make a content to be cheesed, but to absolutely shut them out is embarrassing. It pmuch follows this for season 4 even.
---
Ever since the drop of HoT (removing of monthlies), the rewards are gutted and options be so limited to feel rewarded. Now youre more on a laundry list to forced to play to be rewarded system. The achievement points are so low, it's odd to say achievement hunters nowadays. Starting LS S3, the story doesn't give you shit and replayability is zilch unless you want Aurora and some trinkets - once you gottem all, why bother?
---
You thought RNG on loot was shitty, well it's shittier if lootboxes (more like cash dump boxes) are rng. Buy 5 mounts for a chance of 1 mount that you like or get a premium for the 1 mount you can select. Black lion chests - enough said. Buy more outfits while during the content drought we need more of your money fueled for whatever shits we won't tell you.. oh wait, we have chairs.. fancy ones.
---
Festivals and new skins yey! Oh wait it's nothing new this year cuz the dev who made it is either "laidoff/quit/working on non gw2 related things".
---
Unless we're 13 and living under our mom's basement, we don't have time to invest like we used to. We have more commitments in life and having more responsibilities do not help us to sit for hours playing gw2. It's usually not a one hour session, you come in and go out - unless you're doing dailies laundry list and it's a chore not a fun game. Point is, people are on a tightrope whether to commit 2 hours after work or play something else for that jolt of fun. I say this after pouring over 5k hours.
---
I can write all day long but theses are the most prominent reasons that reflect a portion of the gw2 community as of March 23, 2019.
---
Why is Belgium blocked from the sales?
---
goddammit you had to go and make it erotic somehow
---
What does any of all that mean someone please explain me in layman terms. 
---
Reddit admins have been tough lately, gotta stay on the safe side
---
Love this style. Very creative !
---
The mordremoth fight was so difficult for me that I had to ask for party help to finish it. You're right. It was tough. I was even a squishy ele back then too. It's actually what prompted me to change classes that day.
---
Kralk, 'cause there's no save against being Branded.
---
Maybe lootbox laws? not sure what it would have to do with non-lootbox sales though
---
And yet, they said it anyway. 
---
the difference is that to some people, dominoes is actually fun. if you've ever encountered any of the people who regularly play WvW, it's pretty obvious that even they don't find it fun.
---
Stretching harder than the cat in panel 4 with that vore reference.
---
&gt; WoW(and other MMOs) never update festival events and no one bats a eye. Anet don't update one event for a few years and everyone loses their mind.
---
Arenanet historically used to be really great with their festivals though with an ongoing story like with the Halloween stuff for instance in both Guild Wars 1 and Guild Wars 2 (the introduction of bloody prince).
---
Then they just stopped caring and decided to take the easy way out like everyone else. I don't blame them, is a good decision get a good return on minimal investment and all that but still it's a shame.
---
MIght as well jump on the asking how train :3
---
*Praise... Joko...*
---
It's a little wet for trailer, then again I wasn't expecting a trailer at all, but it makes sense they know how divisive this content can be in the community why do you think they didn't show anything from inside the box itself other than the fact that there probably isn't anything new inside the box of course.
---
At the moment, it's probably Kralkatorrik due to recent story spoilers. But if we were to continue killing them without containing the spilled magic and Tyria doesn't vaporize from the chaotic magic, then the last dragon alive would be the strongest. At the start of the core game, Primordus is likely the most powerful as it has been awake and absorbing magic for the longest (barring Bubbles being awake earlier or something)
---
Dragons are also considered stronger than the human gods. It's debatable whether the gods are actually incapable of killing the dragons or whether they just know that even trying would end up destroying the world, but the gods are not so strong that they can do something like easily kill a dragon in the same way a dragon could kill a human. Case in point, Balthazar was at least mostly powered up and still basically just did what we could/would have done: made a thingy to kill Kralkatorrik.
---
I like Golemsworth.
---
0/10 can't merge with Dolyaks.
---
Can't merge with my noob pvp team mate to bring their mortality rate down.
---
I use the slingshot skin. Just for the "plop" sound (and because it looks ridiculous on a big charr :) )
---
Absolutely rookie hours
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience#Experience_modifiers
---
ELI5? Pretty please? Use little words so I have a chance at actually understanding WTF they did and why it's great.
---
Same here. I really wanted the Starbound griffon skin. Spent abt USD 105 before I managed to get it. Not thinking of the exorbitant amount spent but it was worth it. 😂
---
Playing the UI not the game. Downvote all you want but this is basically what this here is.
---
Well, we really didn't need to know that was what you were into.
---
isnt exact oposite the truth tho? imagine vanila gw 2 pvp, 100x better than of this shit. 
---
You don't want to play a soulbeast solo? It's one of the best solo classes with the amount of self boon uptime. Staying permanently in merged form is probably a rookie mistake when people try to solo certain events.
---
Let's say I find the Dragonhunter squishy. So I find all classes below heavy armor closer to instadeath than anything else.
---
I think it should be all fixed:-)
---
I agree. Having the 15 seconds of stealth while not showing any sort of field is just too powerful. With the insane sustain of scrapper. It just doesn’t seem to fit into the class. People compare it to mirage or thief but it isn’t quiet the same. Thief has to either use a long cd or use all of his or her initiative. Mirage or Mesmer have three stealth skills at best.(this is including must have utilities such as blink.) and they only last a few seconds at a time. I just think the amount of stealth given is the problem. With 15 seconds of stealth it’s hard to guess when the scrapper is going to time the burst. I’m not saying it’s impossible to counter but when a scrapper is low, they can stealth up, heal, and burst within that time. Again I believe it just needs a few tweaks. Either make it not last as long or some how make it visible that there’s a stealth gyro. And that’s just the 1v1 aspect. Playing with a scrapper with stealth gyro makes opening bursts that much more deadly. Since you have almost no way to see it coming.    
---
Nothing can really be factual but the fact that forming a 2 man team is easier and requieres less players than forming a conquest team.
---
To me, this games pvp needs a face lift. If they dont do that by introducing a new mode by replacing conquest what can they do? How can they reinvigorate the conquest?
---
Or have we come to a point where we just land a balance patch every third month and slowly the the spvp scene fades away even more? 
---
I guess it was an oversight, but "it" is used for animals. Glint, Aurene and Vlast had a higher state of development that allowed them to reach human-like reasoning, therefore earning them human pronouns. 
---
Exactly. Haven’t played the game from year 2-4 and after that it was pretty on/off too. The fact that I can always just jump in and come back whenever I want is great!
---
I will definetely watch this at home! Also many great thanks already for doing this kind of stuff and bringing it to the community. WvW can be so much fun and we should get more people involved. It is a shame that people think it is not worth it sometimes.
---
No? What I’m trying to say is exactly in the title. For some reason people made it about the amount of hours I played which is besides the point...
---
Going to be interesting to see how prices fluctuate.  I would hate to see the Unidentified gear only drop Elonian or Awakened rares and none of the older stuff.  I hope to god they updated the drop tables for them.
---
ok..?
---
Thank you
---
Won't you come.
---
I mean....ANETs been barking that for years and yet they add stupid little symbols next to the plethora of boons to let you know when certain things trigger 
---
People not kicking a Necromancer because they noticed the skilled player on last week's encounter.
---
The easily attainable slots that will boost your EXP are:
---
Food
---
Utility
---
Celebration
---
Guild potion
---
Guild banner
---
Drake steak and strawberry ghost are both foods. The will not stack
---
Sharpening stone and tuning crystal are both utilities they will not stack
---
If you are in a guild and own either HoT or PoF you can go to the guild hall and a the tavern master will sell you some potions with various boosts. You can look for heroic banners there are usually some in popular spots like the airship in Bloodstone fen or Pagga's WP in Orr.
---
Celebration boosters look like a present on your HUD, XP boosters are just the letters XP
---
Finally there are some boosts you get for doing hearts or events in various areas or during seasonal events. 
---
Mind to share how you can get a full ascended set out of Jahai Bluffs? Also longbow is a condition weapon you're probably better off with rifle. 
---
lol
---
How is it a "Story" ? It's not. It's an activity.
---
Preservation. If and when ArenaNet goes under (most likely due to NCSoft mismanagement if it does happen), the ability to keep playing on private servers is paramount to the preservation of this game.
---
Which is gorgeous!!!
---
Preservation of video games, including MMOs, is important. A private server (at the very least the software) would be a valuable thing to have.
---
I just had the overlay on while I practice rotations on Golems, T1-T3 Fractals etc. I don't usually use this nowadays that I understand how rotation work and the muscle memory is pretty set in stone. It's just a great tool for people just starting out and/or trying to master a new class IMO.
---
IIRC, SAB was originally slated to be part of Festival of the Four Winds 2014, which was meant to be a collection of some of the "best times" of Season 1 for the China server, since they missed Season 1. It didn't return because a number of game breaking bugs for SAB got introduced sometime between Back to School and FotFW 2014. It was some bug introduced through adding new content for S1's last arc (Origins of Madness to Battle for LA). One of those odd "spaghetti code" situations where something that by all logic shouldn't affect other things, somehow does.
---
ArenaNet didn't want to spend time fixing that bug, thus SAB didn't return until 2016.
---
FotFW content ended up suffering similar bug(s), which got fixed last year. IIRC, those bugs focused around Zephyrite skills and Crown Pavilion content.
---
World 2 length was never one of those bugs, it was just a point of contrition among the playerbase, which Anet addressed when they worked on those bugs. World 2 length was in no way related to why SAB wasn't around for 2014 or '15.
---
If anyone ever does daily rooms unfairly, playing one-sided or aggressively or won't respond in say chat, I leave the room and come back later. Dealing with shit ass people is not worth a daily. 
---
Even if you rebind ur skill you probably know that 2 is the second skill of your bar
---
There are more paths that can be soloed than can't.
---
uh... When you paint a thing that looks kinda weird and fancy and your old art teachers are telling you in your head that every painting should have a story, and you're like... can do fam.  
---
 Then you wake up next morning and decide to cut on caffeine. 
---
Your minion just doesn't want to swim around Rhendak anymore :v
---
I wouldn't say gw2 is dying. Just they milk old content for years and years and years.
---
I was working on a video tutorial on how to create this text but the higher ups cut the budget and forced my production company to shut down this project. I still wanted to share what I built so here you go!
---
&gt; but even taking data from GW2 Efficiency, about 10% of PoF owners never completed first story mission of PoF (don't have Sparking The Flame achievement unlocked).
---
I would argue that they are the 10% of players who are exclusively PvP/WvW and have no interest in PvE.
---
I don't think they're lost, They're just not interested.
---
His point is not that he is smart. It's about one challenging himself to get better through practice. No one nails his rotation on first try.
---
We don’t want to scare the children!
---
KOOHINOR

8AZA8
---
Yeah, Condi weaver is complex, but also not really wanted in any Squad comb.
---
Comment on the official forum: "I think you forgot to add new content to the game so people would have a reason to get back".
---
Whoever wrote that, have an upvote. :P
---
Huh, TIL...
---
Well, they might have lost some aestetics, but they are actual usefull now
---
I don't think many people played scrapper before the change to have any opinion. In gw2 viability always wins with flavour and devs don't really know how to balance specs without removing their flavour.
---
Previously gyros have their own health pool, follow the player and can be easily cleaved and so don't provide much if usage. Now they are fields around the player and invulnerable.
---
True it feels a bit like they are not visually gyros, i would prefer the small sized gyros a bit larger aesthetically
---
Well, meh. Good intent, but this is way too much to squeeze out the musical instruments of Gw2 :)
---
The tempo is quite unprecise and the score is not totally correct. Anyway, nice job ;) 
---
I agree, I was wondering why I was much more tanky, then I looked at bulwark’s stats. 
---
Well, since their sudden increase of communication feels like a smokescreen for the internal banwave and a desperate attempt to "prove" they're as dedicated as ever... :P
---
Wasn't the only magic we used against Zhaitan big ass lasers?
---
What happened? :P
---
Sad, I really like the stats, I just miss seeing them floating around. 
---
...the layoffs?
---
When I read this, I see that: "omg, we need to fill time to next episode, what do we do, we have nothing, we have nothing, people are quitting, because they have nothing to do, we need to fill all this time with no content somehow, omg, omg!"
---
What about those who loved it but are bored out of their skulls with the absolute, complete, total and utter lack of change?:P
---
Players to Anet: "Welcome back to GW2!"
---
And 3 seconds later you're impaled by the spears sourrounding Samarog.
---
Maybe you lagged and didn't realize it? One time I lagged very bad and when I got downed I instantly respawned because I was behind as long as it took to respawn. So maybe you lagged without realizing and the warr hit you for quite a lot before the damage registered. The servers have been wonky lately.
---
This is the best Minecraft resource pack I've ever seen.
---
you are a hero and your pathing is the only reason i got my tribulations done last year. thank you
---
There definitely were comments from ArenaNet employees about low interest/retention when it came to back to school.
---
I am pretty sure Josh blogged about it way back when on his personal blog at least if I recall correctly.
---
if they sold SAB mount skins as well as a SAB-themed 1% zone pass that also gave permanent access to SAB year-round, maybe they would have the data they need to devote development resources towards it
---
my pleasure:-P
---
There's no save against being corrupted by the other Elder Dragons either though.
---
Latency kicks in :D
---
here's our ugly monster. wish we have the talent to build a nice one like yours! xDDD  
---
https://gyazo.com/c39cbe9cd3d73e0408a3f7418139eaee
---
Do you just mean the six Elder Dragons? Their power fluctuates, depending on how much magic they've individually devoured. More magic consumed = stronger. This is why each Elder Dragon we've faced is stronger than the last, as when Elder Dragons die, they release the magic they consumed (and then some) into the world for the remaining Elder Dragons to eat up.
---
At the beginning of the game, they're more or less on par to each other, though arguably one can proclaim that Primordus is the strongest as it was awake the longest, closely followed by the DSD who awoke around the same time as Primordus. Jormag, then Zhaitan, then Kralkatorrik, and lastly Mordremoth in last would follow suit until the death of Zhaitan with the end of the personal story, and Season 1's finale giving Mordremoth a massive powerboost.
---
At the moment however, with Zhaitan and Mordremoth dead and with Primordus and Jormag put to sleep due to their magic being drained by Balthazar, it's most likely to be the Deep Sea Dragon. While Kralkatorrik was certainly closer to the deaths of Mordremoth, Zhaitan, and Balthazar, the  DSD has been awake for nearly 200 years longer than Kralkatorrik.
---
Draconis Mons was fantastic. So much to discover thanks to the mastery! I loved the collections. Collecting the stuff for The Wayward Henge felt like tending the stone or something... and I loved how it took you to core maps. Definitely a unique feeling.
---
I would also like to have a miniature of him
---
Can confirm. I've only collected 2 months worth of login bonus after over w years! And probably around only 200hours, a lot of time is afk doing chores with zone music in the background. I have a full ascended set for my Vanilla warrior the second character I got to 80. I was a very lucky player when I first started, a skin dropped that sold for 90g wothin my first day of playing. Then I bought 50g with gems and was able to craft most of the ascendeds I didn't purchase with ectos&amp;laurels
---
no it wasn't lag. i know when i lag since i have arcdps, the fps and ping updates by the second. the warr does have unblockable attacks which we all know to dodge. i mean come on, plat players. the only time we couldn't dodge if he nails the stun. easier to nail at close range. but he wasn't a rifle warrior at all. his duo guardian just tele from far to close in like 2-3 secs. no way.  
---
i wouldn't notice if not cuz team said they were downed at far, after i said i was dead dead in a few secs at home. so we said we'd regroup. he already here before i respawn. so yea.   
---
it doesn't matter really. just drop it. i just wanted to add to let people know the spvp population is very small. so when you run out of players to match up with, you do stupid things like hacking, i guess. and anet doesn't seem to do anything about it =/
---
Top Tip: 
---
- instead of using your first massive pile of gold to craft your first 1-2 legendaries, get a perma bank and a trading post contract.
---
- then get some shared inventory and bank tabs from converting your next legendary’s worth
---
And boom. Perma inventory wars win
---
Ive been asking of a wyvern skin griffon since day one!
---
But still, only looking at your skills gets you killed. 
---
Likely this is possible for the WvW and Mistlock because they’re instances, so it’s pretty easy to set variable to the character location before he pass is used. The lava lounge, airship and terrace, however, are part of the global map, and so there’s probably some technical limitation in setting this location without immediately overwriting it after moving from the spawn point
---
But do you not realize that both parties dismounting puts u back to scenario A? Combat tag removes chance of mounting, sure in a 3v1 that allows a person to go OOC for mount to catchup but that is the same as previous when a person would go OOC for the increased movspeed.
---
I’m also at work so will read more into it once home again but what you’re saying is literally all the same with or without the given X factor. (Dismount or no dismount)
---
Atm the only classes that guarantee full dismount before an enemy runs away is rev thief and mesm, this renders over half the classes/builds useless if faced vs someone with a mount that knows how to utilize the dodge meaning it pretty much guarantees them a safe get away. Doesn’t this kind of work against what wvw is? A player vs player vs environment gamemode? You’re safely giving over half the classes a no chance of fight vs mounted players effectively making the gamemode player vs environment for half the classes that can’t catch a fight (talking roaming/solo perspective)
---
Giving these players for example a 600range dismount evens the playing field once again.
---
From what I understand the dismount will also be an ability, which means you can dodge it.
---
Players with merchant contract / ecto gamble don't even have to teleport in the first place.
---
Cities aren't populated because of this, it's just an unnecessary loading screen and a map that you just go through without really staying on.
---
That's one of the first "augmenter reality" episodes; you have to literally print out a guiding star and stick it to your monitor for the episode to work.
---
Wow I didn't even consider that it was snow haha, it looks like sand!
---
Nope, it's not helping the people who need to learn about it. There are actually tons of good video guide of break bar if people just google "break bar gw2".
---
After seeing your post I was inspired to try my luck at the mystic toilet.
---
here is the [result](https://i.imgur.com/mBmvOJA.jpg). 
---
thanks dude!
---
True but those are harder to get than a pass.
---
So far, IIRC, only the Mistlock instability has this feature. As per OPs request, every single lounge would have this and we currently have 9 of them.
---
Those you can buy, 6 of them, cost 1000gems which is ~360 gold or 12.5 Cash.
---
Sure you still would need to buy one of those but you wouldn't need to visit a city ever again.
---
A merchant contract currently is only available through a huge amount of money.
---
* Black Lion Merchant ~800g
---
* Trading Post ~1200g
---
* Bank access ~4000g
---
So the number of players who own them is already very low. And the Ecto gamble requires you to open 100 Globs of Destabilized Ectoplasm which is even more money with 10000g and 25000 Globs of Ectoplasm without counting the return profit.
---
Most of the time when I do this instance I glide between only 2 updrafts which increases a lot your chances to avoid rocks because you are always changing direction.
---
If you still have trouble doing this achiev then I would totally recommend you do a run with someone else while this someone else is the owner of the instance because Mordremoth will throw rock at them and not you. All you have to do then is not be in the same area the owner during the forced flight phases (basically pick 2 updrafts each on opposite sides of the area).
---
yea it's not
---
you don't get elite specs, you are severly limited to 1 gear+sigil/rune combo that sucks and makes no sense(something like soldier armor+condi upgrades) etc.
---
Cities are hubs for players that dont own vip lounges. When you have a lounge there's no need to port to cities, but that's the only way to go to other maps. It's just an unnecessary loading screen.
---
Can I too be welcomed back with relevant content please?
---
Any up to date video explaining how to make money (or spend fest currency) in the event coming up next week? I'm asking because it took me some time to discover the envelope thing last festival
---
And teragriffs for griffons!
---
I knew there had to be something kinky in there. I just knew.
---
BnS gear is ridiculously grindy.
---
Anet prides themself on horizontal progression, Ascended gear is not hard to get, only time consuming and most people have full sets at this point.
---
Really is no harm giving it out to newbies anymore.
---
I would prefer it to be not a gemstore skin, but a skin that you unlock in a hidden achievement in HoT story or something like that. It would motivate players to buy the other expansion aswell and spend more time in the game
---
&gt; Why would new or returning players have any reason to complain about the amount of content in the game? If I stopped playing 2 or 3 years ago i'd be a bit overwhelmed with the shit I can do that is still relevant to the game.
---
Yeah, GW2 is an enormous game with tons and tons of content.  It's just hard for someone who has spent thousands of hours with it to see that way.  But speaking as someone who picked the game up 9 months ago after buying a copy at launch and dropping it shortly after, I spent a good 6 months playing the game a *lot* and have not made my way thru much of the content.  People who are returning can come back to a really rich experience.
---
"Deposit All"
---
Yeah I'm probably gonna switch soon.  Just looks cooler for the build.  
---
You have to get all the elegy and requiem armor for the ascended set.  Takes a while.  
---
I was trying to get daily, OP was not (he was in a daily room to get wins for his pvp track, not to get daily), and OP stopped me getting daily for 2 minutes, which is why I started typing (time was going and I was getting frustrated and desperate. I in fact got no daily that day, so he successfully trolled me). Participation does not involve capping a point, but it does mean you have to participate (get some personal score).
---
I was really surprised by this too.  Alot of good places leylines in particular could go
---
Yeah, this is correct - just pointing out that the build exists.
---
ANet took a step into the right direction by removing the toughness you gain from Weave Self to counter aggro stealing, but that's not enough to make it desirable, especially with condi builds out there that can achieve the same without playing Mozart. 
---
If you tried and that's what fits you the best, that's super awesome. I'm glad you found your perfect match then.
---
name? I want it now
---
When I first learned about Soulbeast my first thought was soul vore ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Oh I agree with you there, I think giving newbies more a fighting chance allows them to learn more of the tactics to survive. To me, WvW gameplay starts in the Zerg, the Warclaw helps them get back to the Zerg/commander
---
This is something I'm going through now, I've been playing WvW exclusively for 3 months, and I sucked at first a lot. Once you learn to survive in a Zerg and how to position yourself during the contact, after the clash it always devolves to picking off and engaging with the survivors 1 on 1, this is where confidence is built. 
---
I've gone from playing tanky support Mesmer to glassy(er) DPS, I play the sides. However being a zerger teaches you all this, it's part the learning process. If I want to Roam I do so on foot, other roamers looking to fight who are mounted dismount real quick. It's a slight tactical disadvantage to not be mounted...but if you're confident. Fair isn't always baked in...thats the other PvP.    
---
Gw2 used to be a game where it.. kind of forced you to cooperate with other players. You essentially wanted other players to join in as everyone would have a better time. Nowadays it's mostly focused on single player pve, leave the map never to return again. If the new maps had a new dungeon in it every once in a while, alongside with some achievement needed to complete something, it would push the old agenda back in to the game, which is what made it so extremely different back in the day 
---
What were the 4 PvP dailies that day? You need to get 3 to finish your daily, and obviously OP was not able to finish them all in the last match. I'm assuming that PvP reward earner was one seeing as OP did not get that in the previous match. Just accept the fact that you were being incredibly selfish with your friend and only focusing on getting your daily, and not helping the room to coordinate dailies as you are supposed to 
---
It works on the minimap, can confirm. However, it has to be left click. (I thought it was right click for the longest time...)
---
They're just more jaded than all of Cantha.
---
What is the best spec of Thief in PVP / WVW at the moment? Is Dead Eye still the best?
---
Who says there isn't? Absence of proof is not proof of absence. For all intents and purposes, magic is technology in the GW2 world and largely works within the Newton's second law - so there should be a way. 
---
It's not dying anytime soon so if you're interested, hop in. It's also f2p so you'll lose nothing by giving it a try. The paid expansions add lots of cool stuff like gliders, mounts and elite specializations (after you hit level 80), also f2p accounts have [some limitations](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015898508-Guild-Wars-2-Free-Account-Features-) but the game is fully playable.
---
I've so far played through the first expansion and it was definitely worth the price (got both expansions as bundle for some 25€ earlier)
---
No worries, if you have Nvidia's cooler it will chill at 90 degrees all the time
---
Meanwhile people on the XIV subreddit complaining that they don't have a new healer in their two new classes and that the two new races aren't available for both genders.
---
Well, along with using the tendril as a starting platform, I finally managed to get it solo with what you recommended.
---
That was very frustrating to get. Thank you for the advice.
---
#titlegore
---
Making people watch you farm for 20 minutes without actually showing the build afterwards? I'm not sure what you were trying to achieve with that, but this piece of content is pretty useless as it is.
---
We'll get a tonic
---
The biggest news we've heard comes from the layoffs which, as someone coming in now, might not look great to you. However, the layoffs were from side projects and so now there are likely more people working on guild wars 2.
---
And I can't stress enough that, content-wise, guild wars 2 is in a golden age. We have more new maps, new stories, and new collections/things to search for and craft than ever before.
---
RIP my dreams, hopefully it’s a good one.
---
Actually now that there’s the new novelty system I’m actually pretty hyped for a good tonic
---
You know, that's actually something Commander 'let's eat this random rotten pig' of the Pact would say.
---
Yeah. Watching a farming montage when you're expecting a build is great...
---
Well they are around you, they're just realy small.
---
Scrapper is right now overpowered not because it can kill enemes but it can survive a shit ton passvely.
---
Try it first. Download it, get a character up to 80, even (the expacs will need a lvl 80 character).
---
Once you decide you want to stick around yes, both will give you access to new specializations (changes how a class plays), HoT will give you gliding, PoF will give you access to mounts.
---
Both if you ask me but I've been hooked to the game for the last 3 months so of course I'm going to recommend both. Path of Fire added mounts, Heart of Thorns gliders and both expansions add their own elite specialization for the classes. The revenant class was introduced in HoT and requires it (not sure if having PoF only would unlock it)

So you are mad because Anet who has no obligation to fix your mistakes caused by not informing yourself properly has partially fixed your mess instead of totally?

k dude
---
They always blame their technology, while blizzard has had the technology for years. Anet will always be trash.

 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The\_Hunter#By\_crafting](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Hunter#By_crafting)   
---
Yea, so you couldn't do a quick wiki search to find the phrase: 
---
* Crafted once per account after completing [The Predator III: The Hunter](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Predator_III:_The_Hunter) collection.
---
 
---
Conveniently, I made a video covering this very topic a few days ago. 
---
How *convenient* that I would make this, it's almost like this question is asked very frequently hehe xd
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yyRWZD2-0 Hopefully it answers your questions bud
---
And that no one else takes it 😒
---
How about buy the precursor on the TP? 
---
https://www.gw2tp.com/item/29175-the-hunter
---
That's unfortunate, but the crafting panel warned you about this when you made it the first time. Sure, Anet could idiot-proof it, but this is mostly on you for forgetting. 
---
I mean, you're not alone, a lot of people I know have no idea these exist or how they work(ed). A lot of times too people will see daily in the title and go there not knowing how it works and just start randomly killing people for the pvp kills daily and people will say they're trolling when in actuality they've never been to a pvp daily room or know how it works.
---
They're a good way to get your dailies done quick though - pvp player kills, rank points and top stat are ones you can cheese fast/easy in there.
---
If you do decide to buy the expansions, DLGamer is the lowest consistent price from an official retailer the subreddit has found: [$37 for both expansions](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911).
---
A few times a year ArenaNet will have them on sale for $30 total, if you want to wait for the absolute lowest price.
---
[Every time](https://imgflip.com/i/2wrjmj). My dps on holo is like 3k lower than on my weaver but at least I don't have to worry about the damn conjures.
---
when I crafted it the first time I didn't look at the panel, I just happy that I finally finished it, and to be honest that warring should have appeared on tier one not the final tier, or beater yet the recipes should have been removed from the list entirely.  
---
the return of the bazaar and pavillion was in itself a huge surprise, and i believe the new gauntlet tiers etc were announced with the blog post.
---
the new halloween map and race were also mentioned before the release.
---
the wintersday raid was teased in the trailer.
---
LNY... i honestly don't remember, but the only thing new was an adventure anyway.
---
all we see in the SAB trailer is a SAB gourdon running through rata sum. 
---
SAB w3... or just generally new worthwhile SAB content has been hoped for for literal years, to the extent that i would call it the most desired festival change. seems counterintuitive to not utilize that anticipation at all.
---
At least you worked hard to outdo him.

More than a year ago my gaming laptop died and i bought one for 350€, with that i could play gw2 and do even wvw without huge problems.
---
Now i got another gaming laptop, not even an expensive one [Omen by HP], and i'm playing again at mid\max settings, about 850/900€
---
Gw2 isnt gpu based, so just getting something that has a dedicated gpu and enough CPU is enough to play the game at an acceptable level.
---
Poggers
---
Anyone else have those days where you're crushing in pvp and you win 9/10 games, then days like today come along where you haven't won a single game and going 0/5? 
---
I feel like I'm the weak link here but also there are just those days where matchups are so out of wack in every game. Anyways, not much of a question just curious if others feel those ups and downs in the pvp world. 
---
It'd avoid both the MacBook pro and Dell XPS 15 laptops, since both tend to throttle when both CPU and GPU gets loaded.
---
The Razer Blade 15 is a decent, but expensive choice. Gigabyte Aero 15X is another good choice, if you want a thin and light laptop that can also game. However, the Aero might also have throttling issues too.
---
Hall of Monuments Portal Stone.
---
Every. Damn. Character.
---
Josh was a major part of SAB development though. I find it hard to imagine them making a W3 without a core developer there, although it could happen just very unlikely. Chances for W3 aren’t higher at all, probably lower. A bunch of devs from other projects aren’t going to suddenly start working on the very niche SAB festival.
---
Surface Book 2 15" with the GPU base, if you have the budget for it. i7, 16 gigs of RAM and nvidia GPU have plenty of resources for the game.
---
hehe xd
---
unlocking skins through playing the game? what a madlad
---
Legendary crafting is confusing. There's no doubt about it. It's easy to make mistakes with legendary crafting. 
---
A person with experience in dealing with customer service, might go back and try to talk to someone higher up to see if something could be done. Instead you chose to come here. You haven't garnered much sympathy, which doesn't surprise me.
---
But this has nothing to do with Anet caring or not caring about money. This has to do with policy that exists, and people who are enforcing that policy who may or may not know better. This is how customer service works in every industry. Sometimes the first tier reps can't do things that others can.
---
By choosing an inflammatory clickbaity title, you're showing that you're rather throw stones than try to fix the problem. Hint, nothing you did hear will fix the problem.
---
The issue was partly the games fault. It was partly your fault. The loss of some mats, even expensive mats is not the end of the world, and yeah, it's an expensive lesson.
---
Frankly, I'd have had more sympathy for you if you'd come across as reasonable. 
---
Both aurene and the princess

I'm not even sure why they'd make this trailer, just use the rytlock trailer!
---
BnS leveling was gutted when they removed sidequests and didn't rebalance the mobs. It's a giant joke now.
---
i wouldn't get a mac, they are way too prone to issues, some might even say they're designed that way so you have to pay more. check out louis rossman on youtube, he repairs computers and electronic stuff and mac owners are probably one of his most frequent customers

is it worth to swap the fang of mokèlé marauder stats to zerker? for raiding and high tier fractals? 
---
You need 250 Proof/Testimony of Heroics for 1 piece of Legendary armor (in addition to all the other butt load of stuff.) Just another tidibt for potential long term goals.
---
Idk why people keep quoting this. I said "Decent gear" in regards to blade and soul. It's pretty clear right [there.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b49lps/welcome_back_to_guild_wars_2/ej60oml/)
---
&gt;NCSoft to Blade and soul players "Here have a free max level boost, a free outfit and tons of decent gear so you can jump straight back into the game."
---
I never mentioned that Gw2 should also give "Decent gear"
---
some more info on him: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Rossmann
---
"On October 8, 2018. CBC News ran an investigative piece on Apple's business practices surrounding repair of their devices. They went undercover in an Apple store with a malfunctioning MacBook Pro looking for a quote on repair. They explained that the screen is simply black and they cannot see anything on the screen. The Apple store quoted a customer in their undercover video $1200 for a logic board replacement, explaining that the liquid contact indicators (LCIs) turned red, and that only happens when in contact with any type of liquid, so the whole logic board needed to be swapped out, in addition to top case.[2] When taken to Rossmann's repair shop, Rossmann explained that there was no liquid damage, and that simple room humidity likely set off the LCIs. He also explained that a pin that connected the MacBook Pro's backlight was simply not seated properly. After seating the pin properly, the MacBook Pro was seen working again. Rossmann explained his repair shop would likely not charge for simply re-seating the backlight pin.[3]"
---
Updated the post, but thanks for the advice anyways ! 
---
It's your lucky day, 30% off now
---
I would buy both yeah.
---
Thanks! I havent played for about 3 years total so I still find this a significant amount of time dedicated into one game combining it with other games and real life. Fun thing is that after almost 7 years this game has still so much to offer, contentwise, for me. Things I haven’t done or seen yet still to be uncovered. I can still see me playing this another 7 years at this rate.
---
Imagine having your mindset.
---
Yikes.  
---
Oh I see that explains it.
---
I really liked it before, was fun dying even with friends to the 'bosses' that progressed your weapon stats.
---
How?
---
Cranky because you want more asura tit comics aren't you
---
They didnt increase the maximum number? SUPER SAD!
---
The real question is how many /deaths have you accumulated. 
---
It's not bad; I came back briefly for mythwright gambit, all I did was read up on the dulfy guides, watched a few youtube videos, then tagged up myself and led all the regular and CM kills. I'd recommend starting up slow and going at your own pace, such as "Progression for x boss" to "semi exp" and finally "exp only." As long as people know what they are getting into, they are less likely to be salty. It will be frustrating at times and you will have to kick people trying to pretend to be exp, but at the same time you will meet new people who I highly recommend you add to your friend list, so you don't start from nothing every time. Take control and be the leader :)
---
Holy Moly, never realized how expensive these are. What are they used for most? Infinite gathering tools and salvage o matics?
---
Tanks, it really seems to be. I purchased 5/1960. 
---
As long as they would have kept the HoT mechanics in PoF NON mandatory, it COULD have worked according to ANet plans for the expansions to be Standalones.
---
If they were mandatory, it wouldn'T have fit what they had plan which would have meant player to buy every Expansions. At this point, and this IS an unpopular opinion, but I could have seen ANet doing it. but the 10$ off bundle would have been off the chart, since they would have an actual opportunity to sell more, by forcing player to buy to get things done.
---
"Good Skins" is subjective, so you'll have to elaborate more.
---
Might wanna update that flair to "was"
---
I just can recommend nightmare cout armor (from twilight dungeon) 
---
http://imgur.com/9Lq6CbY
---
Dyes are shadow abyss and (idk right now any blue ice thing can check that one tomorrow) 
---
Just purchased as already commented on yesterdays discount Post. Thank you.
---
My issue with timegates in general is that they block me from achieving my set goal. I wouldnt mind farming for ascended if I could craft it right away (don't have the ~400g to just buy everything from the tp), but the fact I have to log everyday to get that one material crafted is kind of a hassle, either I'm going to be playing anyways in which case the timegate is bogging me down because it's just locking me from content, which I can do nothing about, or I'm not going to play anyways, in which case I'm going to have to wait even longer to access said content, which tbh already driven me out of this game once or twice.
---
I know I don't need ascended to raid, that ain't really the issue of having asc gear or not. (edited main post) 
---
 The issue is having a goal I can continually work for in game. Think things like Been There, Done That, where everything you do gets you closer. The issue is that when things are heavily timegated, or locked behind high amount of gold (mystic coins, laurels) it doesn't really feel like you're progressing towards your goal, just towards more money. 
---
portal scrolls/books, access passes
---
Well, loot boxes should probably be banned in the U.S., too. But it's annoying you can't get these sales.
---
Great ! What wing would you recommend as a "turd polisher" to start tagging on ? I only did escort and KC and they seem to require more coordination than I see take place in my fractal groups, so I'm not sure they'd work well with beginners like me without vocal
---
Any suggestion ? (and if condi works well for it, it's even better) 
---
Ya, we were both pretty fed up at that point.
---
don't forget unlimited gem store items (bank) and salvage tools
---
I don't play pvp in this game but I play a lot of pvp games. Even really good players have their off days so don't let it get to you. 
---
I had to zoom in on that part. Tag! "I rolled of the cliff! Tag"
---
Though a contract is purely for convenience while a legendary weapon is not.
---
Furthermore you don't need to pay the full price for a legendary weapon up front, at least not if you want to, while you have to for a contract.
---
But that wasn't the point really. With a pass you can get to those stations and services quickly.
---
lol i always went for the transmutation charges (im never satsifed with my looks and always out of them)
---
For many things. Passes, salvage-o-matics, gathering tools, teleport gizmos, the jumping puzzle gizmo, some food and other items that are useful for many characters (I put my repair cannisters in there as otherwise I'd never use them). 
---
Basically, stuff that is not specific to one character, stuff that is account bound and minor item transference (not as sizeable but a bit quicker than using the bank).
---
By the Spirits! I have never seen this before!
---
goddam i was not prepared for this one this soon 
---
The irony.
---
Same! I had about a 2 or 3 year break, really busy with work/horizon zero dawn/horribly laggy pc (turned out the HD was falling over). Started playing again in Oct when I got my pc fixed and I've been happily zipping around ever since. I may not be the Tankiest Warrior or play builds that aren't seen as perfect, but I enjoy it. I'll play how I like! 😂 
---
Used up all my gems and like 1000 gold to convert to pick up the last 12 \o/
---
YES! Mordrem enemies have such cool designs.
---
Ah yes, the good ol' "Let's portal bomb a smaller group."
---
This makes me relieved as I’m about 1k hours in and haven’t hit Path of Fire yet. 
---
I believe the guild LEET runs it around 11am EST 12PM EST. Check lfg during that time. 
---
Iirc, they said theyre "looking into that" a few months back.
---
Dont ask me where i read that though, I have no fucking clue...
---
Besides the unique layouts and aesthetics (which are a draw on their own merit), you can consider each map's "unique feature" to be serving as a fast-travel point to the map in which the VIP area is located. Royal Terrace gets you right to Divinity's Reach festivals, which is nice, Noble's Folly can jump new characters straight into HoT zones, the Lily of the Elon does the same for PoF with a bonus of having duplicates of all three bounty boards on the map. Havoc's Heir gives you a fantastic starting point for glides and griffon flights even if it isn't in an otherwise interesting destination.
---
And the Lava Lounge... okay that one kinda sucks, objectively, since its only secondary use benefit is easily and cheaply replicated with a portal scroll. But it has a neat aesthetic and I guess its location makes it convenient to feed Hungry Hal?
---
Gosh golly, gee wilikers, zippity doo da, that’s amazing!
---
“Cheap and good,” are very subjective— but here is my 2c.
---
Tier-1 and tier-2 cultural armors can often be pretty good looking and are not that expensive. Be sure to resell it to a vendor for some gold back after the skin is unlocked.
---
I think Vigil armor is a solid set, at about 10 gold for everything. Heavy Plate armor, available from vendors in WvW and for karma is also decent and dirt cheap.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vigil%27s_Honor_armor_(heavy)
---
For Karma armor, look at Dark Templar armor. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dark_Templar_armor/Acquisition
---
I repeat the personal story just to get the free pact weapons at the end. 
---
Here's mine. 
---
http://prntscr.com/n1xehd
---
Bank, TP, Merchant, Mystic Forge, Self Style Hair Kit, Endless Repair Canister, Endless Upgrade Extractor, Executioner Axe Toy, S3 and S4 Portal Tomes, Mistlock and Lily of the Elon, 4x Music Boxes, Revive Orbs which I never use, Teleport2Friends which I almost never use, Red Lentil and Flatbread Feast, Desert Spiced Coffee, 2x Salvagers, White Mantle Portal Device, Prototype Position Rewinder. 
---
I'll probably have to make some changes if I start playing actively again though, not sure if I want to add that Executioners Axe to the new novelty section or not.
---
You're right that people tend to do what you said. Zosin's comment is still no less valid:
---
One combo might kill normal mobs, but champs exist, among other spongier enemies.
---
Tagging doesn't require a special build. I regularly run raid builds on my thief for tagging - just equip a shortbow as your alternate weapon set and press 1 to win. You tag like crazy, don't have to set up a separate build, and can still do literally 5-20x the damage of anyone else in the squad at bosses/champs by swapping back to your main weapon set.
---
That'll happen when they're not on sale tempting us to buy more at their full price.
---
Wow that’s really cool 
---
The problem is i would buy more at full price BUT GIVE MORE MORE TO BUY FFS!
---
You are wizard! 🧙‍♂️ 
---
"Beside the point" is correct. However, like most things in English, people use whatever sloppy incorrect thing they want and get aggressive when you try to correct them.
---
I have my legendary raid armor transmuted as Nightmare head/coat/legs. Warden boots and Toxic gloves/shoulders.   
---
Imo, Nightmare armor is the best single set in the game. 
---
Wish he talked more about videogame design in general.
---
Also, click the link, the thumbnail doesn't skip you to the right timestamp.
---
To add to this especially for legendary collections, you can have an alt character (key farmer) and hold all of those items so when the time comes you can delete the character and he'll take those times with them to the grave. So no more "Shift + leftclick to link an item in your chatbox -&gt; copy it (ctrl+c) -&gt; delete the item -&gt; paste (ctrl+v) -&gt; delete brackets -&gt;" 30 times
---
Oh cool. I wanted more!
---
Hey folks,
---
with the announcement of the SAB festival there is obviously talk about World 3. This is not news to the ex-dev of that little project and we actually had a window of opportunity to ask him on his stream. 
---
(if the link doesnt put you on the right mark, its 07:27:37)
---
Anyway, this is after Josh got laid off and he is not in the best condition in this stream. So he rambles a bit about stuff but they are valuable informations until we hit the NDA wall. 
---
Personally I think its great to hear that the head of the team responsible for the festivals including SAB just loves the SAB and would love to get more content out for it. Yet I can understand that Anet didnt really do a good job monetizing it and with the effort that Josh and his coworkers had to put into it, I dont see any fast resolution (especially with the new team groupings after the layoffs)
---
ALSO hey if you like the guy, he's doing a book. He is about to sell it too. It's sounding massive. Check it out if its your stuff or not. 
---
You can tickle all sorts of informations out of him in his streams. He has sworn to answer almost every question that comes in. His worldbuilding ability is off the charts, I swear.
---
GW2: has content before max level that is enjoyable and worth playing
---
B&amp;S: HAHAHAHAHA
---
They really need to make luck a material item to deposit all
---
Join a training guild! I can't speak for other guilds but the training guild I'm in (Raid Training Initiative on EU) doesn't have any commitment expectations. We have a calendar where we post raid trainings on any day of the week, and you can join them if and when you have time to learn the fights and get the kills.
---
Thank you, I'm going to do that. 
---
I mean the partners will be doing what exactly?
---
Creating more content? How does that get someone from a viewer to a player if they're already a viewer? 
---
Oh my god yes, i was hoping for 30%
---
How many would you vets recommend getting on top of the 2 that came with the expansions?
---
In one game levelling is an awful experience that you want to be done with as fast as possible so the developers incentivize you to come back by letting you skip the levelling
---
In the other game levelling is a pleasant experience that you don't need to skip to avoid wanting to hack off your hands, so the developers don't need to incentivize you with a level skip, so they don't.
---
I bet there's a tonic and maybe an adventure addition. Doubt we get a full w3 :(
---
I keep tools for wast swap on alts, salvage kits, lily of the elon pass, s3/4 map tomes, merch/tp/bank express, prototype position rewinder and my legendaries.
---
so many new undead assets from pof. plz give necros new options for pets QQ
---
Yeah. It would be nice if there was cross-expansion masteries and bonuses like this. 
---
I ran it with them yesterday evening around this time-ish (I'm Euro on NA). They did all the HoT metas. 
---
I really like Caudecus Manor heavy armor, simple yet knighty.
---
E.
---
Like paying for new living story seasons, if only they had sold a pass for every new world they would have made tons of $$$ . 
---
Set your Graphics to application Controlled in Geforce experience.
---
Then remove any AA/AF settings....Start up the game.
---
Then add more and more settings...remembering the last one you enabled. Once you find the source of the blurriness you can then increase other effects.
---
I wish we could customize pets, minions, and kits with different skins :I.
---
You'll struggle big time with an FX chip. GW2 may be the most single core dependent game I've ever come across. The king of GW2 is an OC'd 7700K, that thing is a single core monster. Anything modern will do fine, but there are very few systems out there that can sit at 60+fps in a city or main hub. Ryzen performs decently, especially when OC'd, I use a 1700X myself. But Skylake or Kabylake are the way to go.
---
the best gear isn't restricted to living world no. It's just an easy way to obtain it, but you can get equivalent gear easily through other means.
---
But no, ascended gear is account bound, so you can swap it between characters on your account but you can't trade it to other players
---
The reward is one piece of ascended armor, not a full set
---
Good day everyone!
---
Quick question - how’s Revenant performance in Fractals/Raids? I aim to that content and interested if support-alacrity is the only one viable build right now. 
---
Is it worth getting healer gear for them? (Magi, Harrier?)
---
Awesome 
---
Just add it to the novelties. If you later decide you want the item after all, you can get free new ones from the Black Lion Exchange Specialist.
---
Yeah for portability it seems to be the best of both worlds. Thanks for your input!
---
He has done a lot of videos with Extra Credits and he talks about level design quite a lot. Here's the link to the Tomb Raider playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvFQJa1XAXzxfBYBfiCRZuGBzKqyBkXzd
---
And there's a lot more
---
Same and because Im an altholic with 18 characters, I have a full inventory of Lore items Account Bound, on one of them, that was given from the start of Gw2. I even have some rare and bugged items like [???] .
---
Keeping them is like achievement for me and once in a will we have fun in Guild chat loll.
---
Hi There,
---
Hate to beat the dead horse but i'm a returning player, I played the game briefly when it first came out and never got past level 20.
---
I'm looking to mainly play this game casually and mainly in WvWvW, I really wanted to get my existing character (a rifle warrior) to level 80 but someone in chat said that rifle warrior is just flat out not good and id be better off going Deadeye thief, I'm fine with buying an xpac for that.
---
Anyway, for my main questions:
---
1. How long does it take from scratch, level 1, to get to level 80 and unlock elite specialisations (ie DeadEye) and what would be the broad, overall layout of how to do so&gt;
---
2. When leveling should I bank all the crafting materials I come across, should I level crafting as I level my character or should I just sell them to a vendor?
---
3. I somehow have a bunch of currency; 300 gems, 35k karma (????) 7 laurels and 130 honor, given what i've said that I basically want to unlock deadeye asap and get into WvWvW is there anything I can use these currencies on immediately to help me expedite these goals?
---
Thank you for you time
---
Yes, they do.  I have my World Boss Portal Device in one and it alerts just fine.  Haven't tried the Ley-Infused Lodestone there but I assume it alerts properly as well.
---
Probably better to wait for a response..
---
I am, I was just hoping there might be something I was oblivious to that was an easy fix.
---
Staff is for the CC, yes. If you want to keep a ranged weapon, use Shortbow. Shortbow 5 and Darkrazor should do just fine for the CC.
---
You can start with Shortbow 4 AoE field then go to S/S at the start of your rotation. 
---
do infusions of the same type stack ?  
---
like if i use 5 ghostly infusions on 1 character does the animations stack or does it only apply 1 visual effect ?
---
Play with whatever you want, then. Even early fractals can be played fine as long as you know your build. My renegade is running a condi build with mace/axe and shortbow, she's parked at Dredge Commissar and doing story mostly for now. No one is going to complain about you not running a meta build in open world. If they do, please laugh at them.
---
Also, keep in mind raid and high-end fractal builds will usually assume you have a balanced team providing healing/boons/etc so that you can focus on DPS, which will leave you lacking when running around solo.
---
Sounds like you were headed to the [betrothal room](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Forbidden_Vault)
---
Exactly. Although, until they demonstrate for NCSoft that they've got GW2 stabilized and are turning a more significant profit they'll probably not get greenlit for a new project for a while. The layoffs came with a merger between ArenaNet and NCSoft West IIRC, which pretty much implies that NCSoft has a strong hand on the wheel right now.
---
But that's not the idea of a festival, to make it permanently available. 
---
Even if they would make SAB accessible permanently, then they had to bring regular updates to keep player interested and this brings minimum three problems. 
---
If they don't update the SAB it will get forgotten and in the end, we lose a festival. 
---
If they update SAB regulary, it costs much additional resources. +1 SAB word = -1 LS episode. So all in all we would get less LS content. 
---
Making SAB availavle permamently and updating them regulary also have the effect that they would "steal" their own players. People would pay less attention to LS episodes and other "real" updates and rather play SAB instead. 
---
And it's understandable that Anet don't want to turn GW2 into a 8-bit game emulator. 
---
The map you are on doesn't matter. It will display what can be spawned regardless of the map you are on. If there is a red X above the creature then you can no longer do it in that particular instance.
---
And I heard that people say that getting repair canisters from BL keys is worthless...
---
hmm, weird, usually setting character model limit to high fixes this.
---
(but these are timegated too)
---
If your on na servers my guilds mostly filthy casuals that will take you in and field any questions. 
---
Ia there a good video, up to date explaining how to make money/spend the currencies on the festival coming up? Thanks
---
when CEO told us that new SAB world whoud take  10 ppl and 6 months i was sure that anet is fucked and have serious issues with adding content.
---
c-can you hit me up with this i cant hold all of these tp to friends
---
I mean that the point of power rotation in gw2 right? knowing your burst chains and the rest is just filler. Like when playing DH you just need to know that before you unload traps you want to throw f1 spear to proc BGH and place a symbol to gain retail &amp; proc retribution. And unless you're raiding with high end guild you really don't need to worry about the rest.
---
Havoc's Heir is the new WvW one? I have Lava Lounge and i like it. Kinda a nice get away. It's closer to an underwater farming spot, sloth event and just a nice getaway. 
---
I mean outside of the obvious map that the lounge location tied to, it doesn't offer anything interesting besides common crafting stations and common vendors. Like think about it, if mistlock doesn't have fractal vendors, it wouldn't be the most popular now, would it? 
---
I'd like to see Noble's Folly has like each vendor of each HoT map or something similar. 
---
It’s blooming, yes, and yes there is  pve and pvp
---
No
---
yea, it suprised me too that that didn't work, I spent about 30 minutes messing with settings, trying to fix it before making this post. Ill try to do a repair
---
I never played at launch, but I do remember clearly my first day.  Lots of wonder and amazement as I made my first character, a human warrior, aaaand...deleted him shortly after.  Then I made my main, an asura guardian.  She's been my MC since that first day.   Been through a lot with her, and I can only imagine you've done the same with yours.

---
Firstly you will need PoF to unlock deadeye but you also get level 80 boost from expansion so that means you can 80 instantly.
---
However i recommend you level up manually depending on how long you play this can take awhile. 3-4 if you play regularly to 9-10 days if only few hours a day.
---
By manually leveling your character you can test other skills and weapons in a more forgiving environment. Also not that DeadEye is a very solo camping class and it may not be what you are looking for.
---
Metabattle.com has some good builds to get you started when you go on WvW.
---
Laurels you will most likely use for Ascended rings and amulets. Karma is for certain items that are for legendary crafting and trust me 35k karma is like 50 copper. Not much. 
---
Focus on crafting aswell cause you will need ascended gear in wvw as wvw has a gear difference compared to WvW. Exotics are also good though. Leatherworking is for medium armor class tailor for light and armorsmith for heavy.
---
This isn’t Skyrim
---
This should answer your questions: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World#Transferring
---
If that still doesn't work, what's left is training yourself to look periodically on your minimap as the walls are shown as skulls(?) like the champion icon in open world.
---
It does indeed!
---
can my account that was banned 5 years ago get Welcome Back !
---
I was in this situation a few years ago. I have a 15.6" lenovo y50 2014 (860m gpu) that runs great and still gets 30 fps avg on medium settings in most areas 5 years later (now runs squads like a dream thanks to dx912pxy).
---
Have had my share of issues w/ it (pre-packaged bloatware/spyware, bad thermal paste, terrible stock CPU temp/turbo settings, parts of case easily break) that I've had to fix myself, but I'm impressed with how well it's worked for gaming/general use since then. For a gaming laptop its pretty thin and fits fine in my backpack. I get anywhere from 3.5 - 5 hrs battery life when not gaming.
---
If money is at all an issue, "older" hardware (within last 3-4 years) isn't always bad to consider.
---
Just remember the battery life is always going to be shorter than what the company lists. GW2 is a resource hog too and chews through my laptops battery faster than any other game I play.
---
If these are following a timeline then she gave them to a charr just before Anet-head ended up falling out of a window while the FBI was giving chase
---
I agree. It has its own instance, so i think it should be made possible. Plus, Mistlock has fractal vendors. Why don't this one has HoT vendors you know? 
---
My god, you are one dumb mf.
---
Everyone has different taste. Visit gw2style.com and pick what you like. Although the cursor doesn't change, you can click on the armor squares which will take you to the wiki to see how the armor piece is obtained.
---
Some days I not convinced this isn't happening xD
---
Hey, welcome back to the game:)
---
Try to check this side http://builds.vabbi.org
---
You can find many useful informations and builds including explanations:) Also you will find general informations about wvw compositions the roles and calls
---
There is a new and returning player guide on the subreddit which is better for explaining general questions. Please be sure to read that. For specific ones
---
1) It depends from player to player but reaching level 80 usually takes around a week. BUT if you played it when it came out you would have birthday presents for the characters that you created. If you have had a warrior from 6 years then he would have got a birthday present every year which would give experience scrolls. Consuming experience scrolls will level up a character. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience_Scroll
---
Now you can level up till 60, play personal story which gives experience and I should say you can get to level 80 in a couple of days. 
---
After that is a bit tricky, at level 80 you can unlock elite specs, deadeye if you have the expac, but to unlock entire deadeye would need 250 hero points.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero_point
---
This would be tricky for a new player if you directly start off with thief profession. Thief's, elementalists, and guardians have the lowest base health pool in the game, so we usually do not recommend new players to start with them. Thief is definitely easy to play but fairly squishy so boosting to level 60 may not really give you the feel of how you are comfortable to play the class as compared to leveling up normally and you may find roaming expac areas difficult compared to central tyria on a thief with less experience. 
---
2) Crafting in gw2 is mainly used for level 80 exotics or level 80 ascended, store the materials earlier and use them only for those because crafting lower level items would just be a waste. There are guides to level up crafting least expensive way. At level 400 you can craft exotics, and at 500 ascended. 
---
http://gw2crafts.net
---
3) Sadly none of them would help with leveling, laurels and gems are good for other items though.
---
Apart from that I kinda want to ask why do you want to play deadeye? Is it just so that you use a character with rifle or are you interested in the profession? Warrior would be good with other weapons and if I have to be honest, more easily accepted in a WvW squad than a thief. You mostly see thiefs roaming alone or in a small party of 2-3 in WvW and almost never a part of squad..because let's face it they won't really bring much for the squad in zerg fights and with low health pool would keep dying.  In fact..even thief mains turn to other professions which are more zerg friendly in WvW for squad. For new players we usually recommend classes like necromancer, ranger, warrior and guardian. If you have no problem with buying expac and mainly play WvW, Nercomancer PoF elite spec scourge, guardian  PoF elite firebrand, are meta. And even warrior PoF elite spell breaker, even after the nerfs, is more WvW squad viable than deadeye or thief in general who are mostly used for roaming, while ranger PoF elite SB sees use in roaming too.
---
The ones I find mandatory are ones for Copper-fed salvage kit, Mystic salvage kit, Black Lion Salvage Kit, and at least one portal item (Season 3, Lily of Elon, Season 4, Spearmarshal's Plea, etc.) From there, you get more of less optional. I have the S3 gobbler, Ley energy converter, Mystic conduit, and then a whole lot of food/utilities. Starting with really cheap magic-find boosting food, utilities, and fireworks, then getting into food and utilities that my mains would use in fractals/dungeons/raids.
---
Mate I've seen extremely new players (I hope they were new) hitting brickwalls in those 7 year old dungeons because of lacking dps.
---
That you can trivialize Dungeons with meta builds nowadays is not the norm.
---
There is nothing tryhard in playing your class properly and doublechecking.
---
Thanks for all the info, to answer your question on my preference to deadeye I sorta had the mental image of like a rifleman standing in the back lines picking off priority targets during the zerg 
---
Oh ok! Yeah you can do that but just be sure to choose your spots and then camp, because as I said you would be fairly squishy and more or less one or a few hits from a zerg would be enough to down a thief. Check metabattle.com for meta builds. Good luck!
---
Airship and Lava Lounge offer nothing xd which is why i brought up the idea. I really wish they add something to each lounge. Airship maybe anomaly location while lava lounge is closer to sloth event. noble's folly should have each of HoT vendors imo, so is the one in PoF has corresponding vendors of the area. 
---
Holding unidentified gear there is a smart time-saver if you don't want that stuff to be included in auto-salvages. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Large_Cube_of_Snow
---
What do you mean? Lol. I have both ecto gizmos and a perma trading post. The point is to get each lounge to offer more than what they are now. 
---
Happened to me on that fight, and I took screenshots of my naked Sylvari while the Big B was dying, too. But by LS4/ Episode 4, I got better... when I finally got the sniper to stand down and let me talk to her, I was still wearing a shirt. I caught her looking down, though... maybe she could see my twig and berries. 
---
Yeah, though part of that is when people dont take advantage of those traits and effects, its like camping greatsword and doing the burst, but instead of swapping over to your other weaponset for that rotation you're just mashing 1 till you can burst all over again. Limits your symbol uptime by relying only on the GS symbol and its retaliation boon when standing in it, creating a longer lull between bursts than if you did the power rotation normally as the filler uptime between bursts is shorter and lets you sustain your damage more before it starts to drop off.
---
mostly just wanted to rule out the dx12 patcher
---
all I can think of is possibly doing a fresh install / verifying files
---
Hello, to reply to all of your previous opinion or thoughts you wrote down before, ive decided to hook you up with the story a bit, so you might actually change your opinion.
---
I am leader of tF, linkas now ex guild. Before 3 months an italian player showed up to follow everything linka or tF was doing, later started adding to set up scrims, embarassing and bullying my people. You May think of a gvg community as an elitist one, and im only tell you that this thought is correct. We have way more knowledge and skill in the game than 90% of the playerbase if not more. However, we are still players ourselves And we have paid for the game as have others. We are not straight toxic or whatever you want to call it to people if they add or anything. We simply ask them nicely, multiple times, if nothing works, we ask the enemy guild to simply kill the person. In 99% cases being nice works, and then there is one person Who this thread is About. So after doing everything listed above, we Made multiple tickets asking for help etc, however only this one got a reply you can see. After 3 months. The player has been previously "siege griefing" on piken and got punished. Now there are 300 emails asking for the punishment he deserves. I cant really understand how can you tell us to not be basically selfish, if we have our scheduled time and we put effort into preparations and act like you are not selfish at the same time. Yes this might be a pvp gamemode, but it is a mass pvp gamemode and it is dying out. So id be Very happy if you could reconsider your opinion and maybe stop thinking you know the best. Good bye.
---
I don't "need" the set, I just wanted it for the sake of diversity, just thought it'd be a fun goal to work towards. The perspective of having to log for 30 days straight just to craft cooldowns kind of killed the fun for me.
---
I know I can get around the cds by buying, but that's another kind of interaction I don't enjoy, a better example would be gifts of migjt/magic in leggy crafting.
---
You have to farm roughly 400g of materials, I perqonally don't carry that much liquid gold on myaccount, and that's fine, so I'd work my way around it, the problem is there is no way to reliably get those, youcan't "farm" t6. You farm gold to buy them, and that's what kills the enjoyment for me, somethong just doesn't feel right in farming gold when I could be doing something that has an actual link to what I'm trying to obtain
---
Provisioner tokens, for example feel just right, you have to craft items to supply the pact soldiers to prove your dedication to the pact, and by doing so earn your gift of dedication, you're doing some brainless farming, but it feels like you're progressing towards your goal
---
I guess I just have a problem with farming gold for the sake of it 
---
Hm. Did you try to repair it already?
---
I mean yea, you shouldn't turn off your brain once your bust is on cooldown but its not that big of a deal if you make a mistake here and there in filler part of your rotation. Practicing burst even in open world can create good habits.
---
Forgot to add the mandatory "haircut with the flower"
---
Gotta be serious
---
Well Josh said at his stream that devs might work on SAB in the future, nothing is off the table. (Also the guy in charge of festival content loves SAB).   
---
Soooo........
---
*\*continues to wait for the day they sell something I care to buy\**
---
We need more games where we play AS good dragons, like spyro!
---
How much does a Chrono boost the DPS of other classes with quickness and alacrity?
---
It's simultaneously delightful and disheartening to hear that ANet has issues with designing content with monetization in mind.  It seems like that makes for great player experiences, which it often does, but a lousy business experience, which is pretty clear by recent events.
---
Holy cow. I’m newly returned from a 4 year hiatus and I’m barely able to break 250 to splurge for the Griffon. It’s going to leave me penniless when I finally grab it.

Also there is the [Special Forces Training Area](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special_Forces_Training_Area) where you can train being less bad.
---
Its also recommended to get [ARCdps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps) so you can check out your damage done, should be 10k-30k dps in normal fractals, certain classes can vary greatly in different encounters.
---
But it should allways be at least 10k dps , thats the least you can contribute.
---
If you look up those guides above and watch their fractal videos too, don't get frustrated if you see them pulling of like 50k+ thats possible for you too but you need to know the fights ins and outs and have an allrdy progressed character.
---
If you have any friends / guildmates try asking them to carry you into T4. Once you can lfg in T4s yourself, you will see a great diminish in time wasted.
---
Your usual fractal takes \~10min even with the most cancerous affixes, you just need people who know their shit.

Tommy Wiseau movies are more interesting than gw2 main plot
---
I was more referring to the orange and red weapons. It's currently impossible to have completed red; without TP or RNG drops, it's not possible to have completed orange either (9 total for the most diligent people iirc - 2 from collections, 2.5 per year from dailies, and three years thus far so 7.5 if all dailies done, more or less).
---
The green and yellow are easy to get within a year, especially with taco markers or the like.
---
I dont think primordus corrupts the living.
---
Thanks for these, I really liked the details he went into how things worked and why he selected everything.  Are there any other good youtubers for WvW content?
---
these aren't even stereotypical dragons, if they were it might be slightly more interesting. as it is, i think they've just created a storyline that they don't really know what to do with.
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

---
OMG. I never thought of doing this. I just have each character use up 3 slots in an invisible bag.
---
Tell me where is the irony? Im a player that actually cares about his dps so he spends time practicing his rotation when he learns a class and then spends more time practicing that shit on a boss. Why do you assume its irony when you dont know me?
---
Don't drop your warrior
---
Getting into deadeye is fun, I admit, but even though it might not be meta, rifle berzerk still hits like a truck and spellbreaker is a top tier roaming machine
---
I'd advise: get your warrior and go play some WvW. You'll get some fun on a class which is really on demand in most organized groups, letting you understand the ins and outs of WvW and group play ("where should I go, what should I do")
---
In a few weeks you'll be tired of getting wrecked on Warrior, because that's what happens when you begin in a game mode. The good news is you'll have 80 tomes of knowledge, above 500 proofs of heroics and (with the right reward track) a full set of armor. 
---
Create a thief, instantly level it to 80, instantly unlock both elite specializations and put him in a full set of exotics, ready to play.
---
Or you could create a thief, play it for a week to level 80, get bored because you can't play rifle yet, get through all of PoF, have to farm gold for mounts, finally get enough HPs to unlock deadeye, farm more gold or craft a set of HoT exotics, which is account bound and costly to make, and finally get into WvW, where you'll get your butt kicked because you're a beginner in the game mode and probably want a new character
---
^I reallywish somebody would have given me that advice when I got into WvW
---
Well, I believe you feel this way because you can basically pull and cleave them all down, no matter what they are. In gw1 there was a big difference between fighting Charr Band or Pack of Ibogas.
---
The stakes have escalated too high, which is why Aurene's thing this last chapter clanged with a lot of folks.
---
It's a very common narrative problem, and it's hard to solve; you start small, then go regional, then national, until eventually The World Is At Stake.
---
Well, with dragons, the world has been at stake for the entire life of the game, and the story has never let us forget it.
---
They 100% should have done this. I don't usually play SAB, and never really want to see anything in the gemstore, but making it free around the usual "festival" period and then have a monthly/whatever pass in the gemstore would have been perfect. It's a game within a game, it doesn't have any impact on activities outside of SAB, you can still pay with in-game currency if you play a lot, and they would have got a steady income for something that is already developed that they could have added to in small increments to keep the interest, and money, flowing.
---
Am planning to have an event for my guild which can be enjoyed by any level. Can you guys suggest a fun thing to do in Divinity's Reach or Lion's Arch? Thanks!
---
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm looking for !
---
I did't go for Ad Inf, as the first collection requires 4 timegated ressources already, which in my current state of mind made me wanna puke (even though I admit it's a low amount of materials)
---
LS3 currencies are ok, I got 7 toons which are level 80 and the portal tome now, so I should be good. I have been eyeing at Astralaria for some time, I should probably give it a shot
---
Thanks for replying ! 
---
Astralaria starts with a timegated collection, just saying. If you want to do it better start early
---
I'd like to have "Fractal Rifts" that are placed in locations that once had Living world large scale battles, like the karka and scalet attacks to LA.
---
Then we could go to those rifts, use them to enter them, and revisit that lost content in the form of regular meta-events. 
---
Nope, his exact words were "the guy in charge is a huge fan" and "it is not inconceivable that it could continue. That's safe to say" hinting that World 3 and 4 might come some day.
---
Know any good videos for that? I have over 500 LI but I've been so busy that I haven't attempted a single Mythwright Gambit boss.
---
The joko arc was a great story. Best villain. Even his motives and speech made us look like villains. It'd be funny if he's actually not dead and somehow is alive being in you no....
---
&gt;!Considering Kralkatorrik has also absorbed Balthazar's power on top of Zhaitan and Mordremoth which the others absorbed as well, i'd say he's probably the strongest atm until he dies. From what we've seen with the Balthazar and Kralk conflict when Balth WAS alive, he was gonna kill Kralk until we stopped him, and considering he was already drained of a lot of his power due to having his god status revoked, human gods are definitely stronger. They're just kind of useless when we need them lmao.!&lt;
---
Depends what you want to do.
---
If you are looking to roam, Spellbreaker, Holo, Mirage, or Boonbeast are pretty much the best. 
---
As for zerging, Firebrand provides boons and healing and will always be needed. Chrono provides boonshare, veils, and great AOE CCs and will always been desireable. As for DPS, you are basically looking as Scourge, Hammer Rev, Spellbreaker, and sometimes Weaver. 
---
I would personally recommend Spellbreaker. With Spellbreaker you can spec to one of the best roaming classes in the game or spec for big zerg fights. Because Spellbreaker has its fight-deciding Winds of Disenchantment, you'll often feel like your personal performance can have a big impact on the outcome of a fight. Additionally, you'll provide a great mix of DPS, boonstrip, and CC once you use your ultimate. 
---
Plus, you get to feel like a total badass as your dive into the enemy zerg and fuck shit up with your hammer and greatsword. 
---
Not a fan of LOTR style fantasy. Very happy with the story arcs in gw2 
---
I see it spawn everytime i'm in that zone without actively trying to spawn it funnily enough lmao
---
I’d give a kidney for half the gold the people in this thread seem to have to buy so many permanent utilities lmao
---
Forgot to state that this is a contest with a prize of 2000 gems. Fashion wars won't be okay for those who just started. We all just started this week heeee
---
What do people think is the best gem store salvage-o-matic? I have all 3, and used to flip between copper &amp; silver dependant on the item's rarity but since the runecrafter's one came out I've pretty much just used that one. I guess I'm trying to gauge whether it would actually be better for me to use the Copper instead, as I am overflowing with Lucent Motes... 
---
Is it hard to get? It'd be a perfect fit for my revenant but there are quite a few steps it seems.
---
Someone who truly understands the strenghts of the game would be great, sure the story instances are cool, but as far as MMOs go, it's really one of the worst types of content to prioritise, it's not replayable and it kills immersion of being in this big world when everyone is the chosen one

I think there was a ceiling cat in one of the vanilla dungeons
