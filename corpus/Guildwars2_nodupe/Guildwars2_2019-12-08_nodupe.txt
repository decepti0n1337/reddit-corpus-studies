Fact is I'll spend more gems if I'm getting value

---
I think this is a good idea, it'll give newer players an incentive to do them and potentially explore old/familiar maps in a new way.
---
Heat stones i guess , but not much else
---
So you're the kind of guy who doesn't know whether a working car has an engine or not, unless you cleave the car in half and look inside?

---
There's assumptions, and there's basic knowledge about how things work. Software isn't magic, and it's pretty standardized, believe it or not.
---
All those answers boil down to "it's on the table" talk we've received for *years*.
---
dude, chill.
---
You're being way to over dramatic about a single word I used there.
---
It'll be a happy day when you can sell all that shit on the TP to the people who need it.
---
That's fair, but I don't need it to be the best. Just to be good. :)
---
But...why the hell would anyone go through all this trouble for an old MMO that is still relatively unknown to the masses, and then continue to pick the one game mode that is already considered to have the least amount of players bar raids, aka the place where botting or exploiting would have the least impact?
---
What would they gain? If it is Anet they hate they only have to wait, Anets incompetence means they do not need an enemy to destroy the game anyway. Turning the community against the devs? That is giving these 'hackers' a lot of credit. Anet did that themselves. There is a reason everybody says "nobody cares about pvp". If anyone wanted to hurt Anet in this way they would have picked a more high profile pve mode instead.
---
No need for tinfoil hat theories when it can simply be explained by incompetence and stupidity/chance.
---
I think we could break this thing wide open if we could only find out how Pepe Silvia is involved with all of this.
---
If you are having trouble surviving against hero points, try kiting them with a mainhand pistol or shortbow
---
I would recommend tuning your utilities for more survivability. Smoke screen is a great option as it blocks projectiles. Both preparations pitfall and thousand needles give good breakbar damage. 
---
For hero points in particular, thieves guild is incredibly strong. You can often not take any damage with all the other thieves.
---
Pretty much :)
---
I came on your last train!!! An absolute joy.
---
As true as this is, chairs are probably the only exception since the best looking chair actually is an in game reward. Still true about pretty much everything else though.
---
&gt; I'd rather not waste my time. 
---
You'd rather not waste your time because you're lying. The toxicity is non existent, if it was prevelant as you claimed it was you wouldn't have trouble locating several threads with a single search.
---
&gt;In your scenario, do you care about keeping the restaurant alive? Or is a game somehow more sacred and shouldn't be shut down like any business with bad service?
---
So.. you want the game to be shut down?
---
i sthere a way to see psna recipes besides going to the npcs?
---
I'd rather not waste my time defending a position I never adopted. I never said that death threats were "prevalent." Notably, my first post didn't even mention death threats. Telling someone to kill themself is not, in fact, a death threat. You invented that argument in order to be dismissive. You continued to attack that argument even though I literally said I wasn't trying to call them common. 
---
As for your second question: Yes, clearly I want the game to be shut down. That is why I said so in the post that you are responding to: "While I would dislike the game being shut down." Given that you aren't actually responding to what I say, but something you've imagined, I'm going to bow out of this "discussion."
---
Welcome!!! :)
---
Not outnumbered 24/7, but all servers (besides BG) generally have a dead zone(s) where they are massively outnumbered. 
---
Although, I have also played matches where we were outnumbered 24/7. First week the JQ/HoD link got in t1 versus the current BP/FC is a great example. They had more kills then red + blue combined. Got farmed virtually every skirmish. Very similar to how stacked BG has been for years (until recently).
---
I can resurrect my own mursaadtoy with these amount of bloodstone. Come to daddy, daddy.
---
&gt; I'd rather not waste my time defending a position I never adopted. I never said that death threats were "prevalent."
---
So, why did you saw fit to bring them up as an example in the first place if they are insignificant and basically a non factor?
---
&gt;Telling someone to kill themself is not, in fact, a death threat.
---
Ah, so this is the logic we're operating on?
---
&gt;As for your second question: Yes, clearly I want the game to be shut down. That is why I said so in the post that you are responding to: "While I would dislike the game being shut down."
---
You also said that people tell the devs to kill themselves, refused to provide evidence, and when called out you said "Being told to kill yourself is not a death threat".
---
Its clear you're being disingenuous as hell because you managed to talk yourself into a corner without any help.
---
&gt;Given that you aren't actually responding to what I say, but something you've imagined, I'm going to bow out of this "discussion."
---
Bye fellicia.

Close Map Timer Window?

Yeah you’re right, what was I thinking. The more clicks you have in a game the longer the gameplay time is

Oh my god where? I didn't see him :O

1x heal ele is enough. Joined 4x random bone skinner pug to test my heal ele all done in one try no wipe no mechanic easy gold even with the lowest average pug dps.

They seem to have found a way to harness Abaddon's remnant magic some time after that fallen god's demise. While not outright stated per se, it's heavily suggested if we look at the dialogue of [Djokor, Spirit Squall](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Drojkor,_Spirit_Squall) in Sand Jackal Run, and [Ziya the Radiant](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ziya_the_Radiant) in Sun's Refuge as we do the "In a Grain of Sand" achievement to gain the "Protection from Branded" effect in Jahai:
---
&gt; **Djokor:** Abaddon is long dead, but his corruption seeped into the sands. When a jackal is forged, what remains of him is given new purpose.  
---
&gt; **Player:** Are the jackals dangerous, then?  
---
&gt; **Djokor:** Even now, they seek Nightfall. But they can be swayed to become powerful allies once we cleanse them of Abaddon's torment.  
---
&gt; **Ziya:** We djinn can shield ourselves from the Brand. It's not perfect—I still don't understand what happened to Vemyen—but I want to give others that power as well.   
---
&gt; **Ziya:** I believe the key lies in corrupted sand, and I'll need your help to gather it. Djinn have turned these sands to their own purposes before—creating jackals, for example.  
---
&gt; **Ziya:** Here's a compass. Well it looks like a compass, but the needle will point you to any sand corrupted by Abaddon's magic. Abaddon's reach was vast—you'll find these sands all over Elona.  
---
&gt; **Ziya:** (after completing achievement) I believe I've figured out a way to imbue a minor Brand resistance into other living creatures—but it's unproven. Hmm...perhaps you can be my test subject...  
---
Another clue is the existence of Branded Vemyen from Jahai and the Veteran Branded Djinn from the Battle of Thunderhead Keep. Before Kralkatorrik absorbed some of Balthazar's magic, he was unable to corrupt djinn as Ziya and several other djinn state in Jahai. However, those djinn were Branded after Balthazar's demise much to Ziya's shock, so Kralkatorrik found a way to circumvent that protection. It would make sense that devouring Balthazar, a former god who still had remnant divinity in him, gave Kralkatorrik not only the ability to enter the Mists but also a way to affect protection derived from sand which had been tainted by Abaddon, a fallen god.
---
I like how the devs have given us clues that we need to piece together little by little. :)

Hey is there any current known bug involving Engis and holo mode? My friend says that after Holo mode ends/ Photon Forge the cooldown doesn't go down, it just stays on heat all the time. My friend has to overheat it for it to reset or something like that (I am not engi main, a guardian so I don't understand their mechanics)
---
Close map timer window.
---
That'll be great, I am on NA.. But in OCX/SEA timezone.. So it does get tricky :( Will see how it goes, hopefully.
---
There is no reason to stunbreak any off the cc from rampage currently, there's no threat from being chain CCD by 3 abilities totaling 100 damage.
---
An elite skill, Rampage, should not have the lowest coefficients in the game on 3/5 skills.
---
There is absolutely no reason to dodge, block, blind, invuln, or stunbreak any of the cc skills on rampage now, there is no threat at all.
---
A parody would actually mean the Asura gets a rewards, this vid reflects the reality of the game.
---
It's mainly because the recipe sheets for the potent ones used to be pretty expensive, but the actual cost to craft them is MUCH better.  Single batch of 5 Master Tuning Crystals is 5 Crystalline Dust, 55s on the TP.  You then take 1 MTC and another 5 CD, and you've now got 5 Potent MTCs.  So normally you get 30m per 1 CD with MTC.  So cost to make 25 PMTC and 30 MTC is the same, total of 30 CD.  But that 25 PMTC is 25 hours duration, while 30 MTC is only 15 hours duration.  But the recipe sheets got added to the Pact Supply Network Agents, and the cost of it went down a good bit.
---
Unknown? When people consider MMOs, ESO BDO WOW and GW2 are all known and discussed. It might not be the recommendation of all of those but it definitely holds a place on the market. BDO is currently experiencing a similar issue with hackers, ESO is declining now GW2 is dying the same way GW1 did.
---
Clearly someone wants to make a void to fill with a different game. Thats millions of dollars worth of mmo players, arguably the most lucrative genre of playerbase considering the other top titles have to fight every single year with new installments vs an MMO retaining its core population.
---
If you fail an achievement mid-fight is there a way to reset? Or do you have to complete the whole fight every time to get a reset? I'd like to be able to /gg or something.
---
There is no mastermind. Its more like a hive mind at this point. There are far too many involved for it to just be controlled by a single person. And they've clearly disguised themselves well because the entire community is fooled.
---
Are you staying for the legendary doppleganger fight, or leaving after the augury rock meta is done? I got mine today from the doppleganger just fine.

Shazam and One Punch Man? Lol

Conspiracy theorists infest everything now. Please just go away.

Aaaaaa! Skill clicking, stop, please, have a little mercy
---
Which server is this on?
---
What legendary doppelgänger? I only know about the doppelgänger for the skyscale collection. Is it the same target? I managed to complete the collection by that doing that event. Hmm I’ll try again later then since it seems I haven’t completed for today yet.
---
Well, i got them all one at a time when they were released, so it wasn't much of an issue for me
---
There are some easier ones you can get, some from AP, if i remember correctly

Honestly, the occasional rares are worth more than deleting all of the mats

do you have klite megapack installed? might help if not.

Im just curious if they will put a sale on gear slots during the holidays. It was already a jerk move to price them that high and that many times. Lets see if they make them also be one of the only items they dont put on sale as well.
---
Best duo ever.
---
I think you wasted your time on that person. By the way they replied I can tell lol.
---
But ya, agree to all your points. Too bad people are extreme to one side or the other.
---
If they are people who don’t want a mild challenge or bother to spend 2 minutes contemplating group composition, then perfect. Allow me to show you all the door.
---
Better than moon boot
---
Better than poot toots.

There are a lot of facial animations
---
Makes sense.
---
The real trouble is trying to maintain GotL stacks without dropping below 35 might. Bringing trident also helps boost summoning, so keep that in mind when using flesh wurm.
---
I hope ANet gonna add Tyria races into daily.
---
Ah ok cool! So open world for now, then wvw later.
---
So again, open world is pretty lenient, up until HoT and PoF, when it gets pretty challenging for new/casual players.
---
With this in mind, as a necro, you can choose to run minions (whatever unique build you’ve made), or a proper dps build (the reaper build I linked). If you really care about melting down enemies and demolishing bosses with pure skill and dps, reaper is the way to go. The build has great burst and one of the best cleave in the game, so all weak groups of mobs die in less than 5 seconds with one skill really. PLUS the great thing about reaper is that you still have one of the best natural survivability as you have one of the highest hp pools AND you have a second hp pool from your shroud form. You also have really good self boon uptime, so it is considered the easiest and best open world raid builds.
---
Or, your minion build is actually good enough for you to use for all of open world. It is great for players who really done want to mash keys quickly and just relax. Although your minions will tank all hits for you, they do low dps, so you’ll be sitting around for a while.
---
Personally, as a raider/fractal player, I use my raid build and rotations in open world, basically never die and all mobs die in seconds. This makes story and general exploration so much more speedy and smooth. I used to only have my ranger, who was a healer. I spent  forever on each mob, but I never died then either, since I had my pet tanking and I was healing myself. This did make story much more tiring and exploration stressful, but I was much more of a casual player then.
---
So, in summary, keep going with your minion build for now. If you want to be a dps monster, get reaper fully unlocked as soon as possible. Follow this [guide](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/reaper/power/) for traits and utilities. Use full berserker gear from the tp for now with full superior runes of vampirism and superior air and accuracy sigils. Get ascended trinkets from living world season 3 as it’s not worth getting exotic trinkets when ascended is so easily obtained. Rotation wise, on weak mobs, use shroud 4 or spam shroud 1 if it’s on cooldown. Full raid rotation anything that looks kinda tanky. The opener will likely kill it.
---
If you decide to go minions, it’s really up to you. You can go with your own home brewed build, which is fun in its own way as you can experiment and play around. Of course, you’ll have pretty low dps this way. 
---
If you want minions but still have some kind of dps, use the above tryhard reaper build and gear with minions. This way you can relax and let your minions work and come in anytime with your big boi dps. The actual gear will also improve you minion dps.
---
I would recommend the reaper build, but that is a highly biased opinion from someone with drastically different interests. There is nothing wrong with the minion build; PLEASE play what you think you’ll enjoy. Also, be sure to have all of living world season 4 unlocked it you want all mounts. If you don’t have living world 3 for ascended trinkets, I highly recommend getting episode 3 as you can get most ascended trinkets there. Of course you’ll want all of lw2 and 3 if you want the full story. Lw3 and 4 bring their own maps for you to explore as well.
---
For WvW, there’s a few different ways of playing. If you want to blob/Zerg fight, you’re going to want to play [power scourge](https://www.vabbi.eu/builds/necromancer.html). The link will bring you to vabbi builds which is for WvW. The unique thing about wvw is that home brewed builds are pretty common and are heavily encouraged. However, you’ll still want a mix of berserker and marauder gear (marauder gives more hp for less dps so find a balance) with your choice of runes and sigils (scholar runes and energy, bloodlust and force sigils are pretty standard and listed on the guide). 
---
Unlike pvp, your actual gear is used for stats, so you’ll want ascended gear and the best upgrades to be on the same playing field as others.
---
Furthermore, your wvw team is based on your server, so make sure you’re on an active server.
---
If you want to get into some action, join wvw and join any public tags if there are any. Joining server discord’s, teamspeaks and joining guilds are a good idea as well.
---
For small scale wvw or roaming, you’re probably best doing your own research since I’m not really experienced there. I do know though that warriors and rangers are pretty good at roaming, along with mesmers.
---
I will also mention the decline of wvw and pvp populations as are a net has been neglecting the game modes. (It’s controversial so I won’t go into detail)
---
Now for rangers and warriors. In zerg, warriors are also crucial, like with scourges. [As a spellbreaker](https://www.vabbi.eu/builds/warrior.html), you strip enemy boons that make them vulnerable to cc and overall screw them over, while still doing dps. 
---
Rangers are no so much great for zerg as it is more single target. It is great as a roamer, much like spellbreaker.
---
In terms of pve dps, ranger has a difficult but super high dps [power soulbeast build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/power/). It is also great for casuals as your pet is basically a better necro minion, so it’s great without elite specializations (which both change pets drastically).
---
Warrior in pve is super important in fractals and raids as a high dps support role. However, for a dps role, you’re looking at [power berserker](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/power/) which is a relatively simple, but high paced build.
---
Both classes are great choices for casual play without the meta builds (with ranger being easy mode because of the pet) and equally great at high level play. If you’re focusing on wvw though, warrior for sure.
---
As a last note, power is better in open world and wvw. Poser let’s you repeatedly bust down mobs in open world, which wvw is filled with condi cleanse. Therefore, condi builds were never mentioned.
---
Lots of words but I hope you got something out of it! Feel free to keep asking questions!
---
Thanks for taking the time to share all this info, I really appreciate it.  I currently feel like my dps is incredible low tbh maybe my current setup? I'm willing to make the changes you suggested but as lvl 71 I dont have the reaper specialization open yet, what's the best core build (I believe that's how is called) until I get all the hero points to max reaper?
---
My idea was to explore the whole map before buying the LW stuff, is that a good approach? I guess I want to get better at the game before I start looking for mounts (as I assume those are in more challenging areas?) and farm for gear/trinkets.
---
As for rangers and warriors, since I've been leveling with the help of my minions (will be changing that) I want to switch to something different so I'll look into warrior but that would probably take a couple of months until I get everything I want on my necro (gear, experience in end game pve, etc.)
---
How's Staff Revenant for casual PvE? Really liking the feel of the weapon ability set so far (though I'm only Lv.8 on the revenant so I only really just unlocked all 5 base abilities)

Might not be the best chairs but Wing 5 Dhuum chair, Wing 6 Pile of gold and Wing 7 floating chair (I dont remember the actual name)
---
Unless Anet are willing to hardware ban the vast majority of cheaters/exploiters etc... will always just come back or use secondary accounts to help their main.
---
Problem is the bots are often alt free accounts.
---
Unless your willing to ban free to play accounts from PvP or use hardware detection &amp; hardware bans they will just come back.
---
You can make 4k gold a month with a bot program doing PvP.
---
Considering they can do that with multiple free accounts then shuffle the money around that is reason enough.
---
Short of using hardware detection and hardware bans there is no way to handle it.
---
For meta option you have firebrand and revanent. Off-meta, tempest scrapper and scrouge can also do support.  
---
I actually don't know when the last time you did fractals was, current meta is fb/rev for a while now.
---
So they should somehow be held to a different standard?
---
Thank you very much. Seems like I will go for FB/Rev then.
---
 The last time I played was right after PoF was released and I played through the story. But I have logged in every time a new living story was released to get it.
---
Then how do ones inside lab during halloween remain up for days??
---
That's why you have behavioral analytics / heuristics.
---
So, do you have any real evidence that what you claim is actually real? all I can see are reddit posts of people that say something might or might not happen and you draw conclusions out of it that fits your narrative.
---
I'm not saying you are wrong or that I have different data but solely relying on data from something other people have said is not reliable data to confirm your theory.
---
And that is all it is, a theory, and nothing more until you have some real evidence at hand.
---
Well you missed it twice. It was available  August 23-September 6th and was a new item on May 21 and was available to June 18th of this year.  That's twice for a good chuck of time.  Close to 4 weeks of availability is far from scarce.
---
I made bifrost like 2 years ago and this coral part still gives me nightmares. Cant remember exactly how long it took me but definitely more than a week
---
There's a whole bunch - see [this wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Converter)
---
Bitterfrost frontier has many corals in a small underwater area, if you have alts, park them in this map.
---
Plot twist your so called mastermind works for Anet, and they want this game to die, cause they have no clue what to do with it or how to deal wit it's code. Lets face it LW4 was suposed to be the ending of GW2 and the start of GW3, but it was caned for some reason, that we don't know.
---
Statistically speaking, this is rather rare.
---
No it’s not you demented Asura, it’s literally purple trash
---
I think the DSD could potentially be the "mother" Kralk was talking about and be more powerful than the other Elder Dragons. It's definitely a crack theory, don't get me wrong, but I think it could work. Think about the domain of the DSD, it's territory/potential territory makes up most of Tyria (the world, not the continent) whereas all the others only generally have a big chunk of land. IRL from an evolutionary standpoint life generally came from the ocean, why couldn't the same be true for the Elder Dragons? Perhaps they're the offspring of the DSD in some capacity.
---
It's also worth noting that the DSD and it's minions are described as tentacled horrors, which if true, is quite drastically different from the other dragons. This could imply that it's something else entirely, more than just another ED, perhaps some Lovecraftian eldritch horror from the Mists that spawned the Elder Dragons. Or perhaps it killed the original DSD and took it's place. It would be nigh-impossible for anyone to know if some crazy powerful Cthulhu-type fucker from the Mists popped in and killed the DSD and absorbed all of its power somewhere in the deep ocean where nobody's around to know about it.
---
Fuck I can't wait to see DSD and more Mists fuckery one day.
---
tried changing characters and closing and restarting the game, it didnt help and its been like this for a while, maybe since the template patch.
---
Every single lengendary probably has a step like this. Collect X of Y but drop rate is borderline bonkers. Check [wiki!](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Coral) for possible coral spawn locations and hope for the best. Try to utilize your alts too.
---
Yeah it kinda sucks, but on the plus side you're almost done! Good luck :D
---
you just described 99% ppl playing gw 2. XD
---
same here.
---
It defaulted to wardrobe for me on patch day(last tuesday), but started going to the main list on tuesday. Still requires an extra click, but at least my game doesn't freeze anymore whenever I open it. No clue what caused it, or what "fixed" it.

Seems random for me. Could be any tab, could be the default screen
---
I don’t see a ring around him that expands as the torches go out.  I see a yellow/orange ring that’s always around the perimeter of the arena.  What am I looking for?
---
My friends tried this and wiped a lot.  Everyone just melted.
---
All but one of my characters have this in their bag thanks to getting the Digital Deluxe version, and some of them were made during the headstart. I just can't bring myself to use them (outside of my weekly keyrunner) because "what if content comes out where I want access to a bank ASAP??"
---
And yes I know that I could just go to Mistlock or Obsidian Sanctum, and have a growing number of bank access express items for those times when I can't, I never said that line of thinking made sense :p
---
Looks more like Leona from League of Legends to me
---
Yea. The beginning he would only feel main if you did charr and all the dungeons at the right time.
---
The problem is you won't be able to use your qt3.14 hairstyle with your bunny/cat/fox ears. This would be a big nerf to fashionwars build diversity

Contact support and politely and assertively put your case forward. Worse they can do is say no.
---
Happens to me every time after i do frac or raids,stops on the next day -_-

Ah, I had wondered how this worked. Interesting.
---
She-Ra for everyone wondering who the fuck Shera is. [He-Man spin-off.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe)

There is a tiny hint of masochism in that line, so I guess it works!
---
Mine went directly to equipment for a while, but somehow it got back to working normally...
---
&gt; As an extension to that question, I'm currently really attached to my guardian, but at this point I still have zero idea as to whether I want to specialize in Firebrand or Dragonhunter. What are their playstyles?
---
They are *generally* slightly stronger than core specs. Guardian is actually probably one of the most balanced, actually. 
---
Firebrand is usually played with a condi build focusing on AoE burning damage - they're pretty powerful. They gain mantras which provide a quick burst of damage, healing or status effects and tomes, which replace your weapon skills temporarily and basically do the same thing. Personally, I think they're fun for a bit if you like a nuke or healnuke playstyle, but I felt it was a bit aimless after a while. They're quite in demand as a support class as they provide a lot of quickness (and healing) with a decent amount of DPS from the burning. 
---
Dragonhunter is basically Core Guardian 2.0. The bow weapon is more fun than it is useful, in my opinion. They gain traps, which are decent, and their F1 skill turns into a damage boost which is pretty worthwhile. 
---
I'd say it was worth trying - Dragonhunter is generally seen as a step up from core Guardian in terms of raw damage, but otherwise plays very similarly. 
---
Some of the other elite specs provide a huge difference in playstyle - Mirage on mesmer is a mechanic change, as is soulbeast on ranger.
---
Does anniversary chair count as ingame reward?
---
I'm actually very close to actionable evidence. Not to mention the images that were posted with names on the game forums/reddit were redacted for containing the "real evidence". Then people like you assume tinfoil theory but the images have already been made public and were taken down. 
---
I have one character name that has been seen in both regions for 5 months consistently. They have also been reportedly recruiting players to a guild \[HACK\].  They [allude, in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aekrul/hacker/edregat?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), to the fact that no one will act upon witnessing them. And with the ramping up of their efforts from small match manipulation to Ddosing entire teams in mATs and ranked, I'm fully confident that there will be more sightings. The issue is that none of you will report or record.  
---
From that same thread where the video and images were removed in the OP, I can tell you that they frequent the FFA arena pit. They're actions include: 
---
* flying to and from the three pillars
---
* teleportation to any part of the pit to evade attackers. at times this even looks like regular lagging but it's small distance tele that moves them behind the attacker to negate their lock. 
---
* in addition to the above, they have rapid teleportation where they move between two points nearly instantly, thus evading attackers
---
*  gigantic frog-like leaping to engage or disengage
---
* clipping through objects and underground 
---
* floating mid-air, negating any melee class.
---
* they've been spotted on mesmer mainly, sometimes warrior and more recently ranger as it seems they use the pet to communicate
---
* they always refer to themselves as **Aliens**. Guild tag \[HACK\]. That is as close as ill go to listing the name to avoid a shadowban
---
If you ask around enough in either region, there have been players that I know for a fact have witnessed the above.
---
I use my eaters like every day, I always run out of these ascended materials at some point
---
They reduced some of that time gate. Though I suppose you might be mentioning charged quartz
---
Do they have a special effect?
---
One more question. Until i get asxended, will an exotic beserker set be ok for evrything? (dungeona, fractals, wvw)

Here is your medal
---
&gt; If you ask around enough in either region, there have been players that I know for a fact have witnessed the above.
---
yeah, because "witness" reports are really trustworthy most of the time especially in online games because they think someone is hacking for various reasons like latency issues or just because of their own biases.
---
Just to give you an example, there are many instances in which you could confuse a fly hack with a player actually gliding down from somewhere. I have seen that multiple times in which players "lag" through the sky but they were actually gliding.
---
Look, I'm not saying you are wrong or that there is no hacking or botting going on in the game but I can only repeat what I have said so far. Without any real evidence, you are basing your, at least that what you wrote so far, on some threads and "witness" reports fitting your narrative.
---
So instead of creating a post that makes you look like a mad man why not wait until you actually have that evidence and THEN present that to the community in a way that others can check it.
---
I still collect my bank expresses even though I have the permanent contract. Soon I'll be at a stack of them

This.....might actually shed some light on very suspicious activity from Arena Net. [As reported in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aekrul/hacker/), a user was actually suspended from the forums for reporting the sighting. Whats odd is that the infraction committed often results in a simple warning and the removal of the thread. But for some *odd* reason, Arena Net found it necessary to remove the thread *and the user*.  
---
Whats even more odd is that [the hacker alludes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aekrul/hacker/edregat?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) to this seeming inaction from Arena net, almost confident that they would remain unpunished in the game. Could these hackers actually be Arena Net themselves? And what motive would there be? Did something go on behind the scenes that we weren't told?
---
The Dhuum chair can be bought with real life money. 💳 → 💎 → 🥇 → 💺.
---
No offense, but somehow I manage to have civil discourse on the internet when I desire it and yes this is on subs which are far more loosely moderated than even this one for example.
---
However subs with trigger-happy mods tend to "shoot first" and ask questions never, creating insular bubbles which treat any disagreement as trolling and get sincerely offended at differing opinions.
---
&gt;that all civil discourse is doomed from the beginning
---
No offence but that's nonsensical hyperbole.
---
Happenes to me.  A relog usually fixes it, but sometimes it likes to open on novelties.
---
it looks like mom on comicon.
---
Are "Arena Net developers" aware that they need our help urgently? Maybe one of them could confirm that this is something sanctioned by them?
---
Because right now it looks exactly like an attempt to organize a witch hunt.
---
WH OMEGALUL
---
its like paying a dollar extra on a ~10 dollar item to take it from small to large
---
&gt; There is no possible way to confuse these hackers with a glide or lag
---
There is a lot of information that eyewitness reports are not accurate and can be misleading or plain wrong just because of peoples own biases.

There are multiple instances in which I was called a hacker or botter in both PvP and WvW just because people were upset and thought the only way that they got killed was because the one that killed them, me, was actually a bot or through a hack. Does this make the situation any less true that they were just bad? of course not.
---
An Example, a week ago I played WvW and found an enemy capping the nearest camp on one of our borderlands. I jumped into the fight but noticed that I still had my PvE template active which was full berserker and while I could do a lot of damage their survival stats were better than mine and I died. I used the WP and went there again and this time I killed the enemy. I got called a hacker then for whatever reason.
---
I have no proof of this but at your own accord, just by my statement, you would have to believe me...
---
I don't know what evidence you have since you have not presented it. All you have listed are "eyewitness" reports which you think are true but you totally disregard that people can be wrong in their perception of things just because of their own biases. "I am a good player and I can't possibly be killed by someone so they have to use a hack"!
---
I'm not generalizing here. There are blatant ways that look like hacking and there are many instances of that proof available that clearly show that this is the case.
---
However, all you did was provide links to comments of other people that supposedly witnessed this.
---
I mean, don't you think that, by your own statement, by "defame the reputation of Arena Net gaming studios" people could, maybe, even lie that they witnessed something to A) muddy your investigation or B) just because they can?
---
While this is not a real comparison but because of shit like hearsay people got burned at the stake just because some other person thought they were using witchcraft.
---
Be sceptical about reports on a platform that anonymises their userbase!!
---
Yes there are many auras. Get a charr and go to the starting area at level 80. Type /salute on the old statue and you will unlock the searing aura. I hope you like it
---
Maybe you should link one of them and find out instead of not contributing like the rest of the community has managed to do this entire year. These exploiters have run unhindered for months on end. When will we finally stand up to them?
---
They care even more than I can ever show that I do. These exploiters have managed to change the public perception of all ANets efforts. They've turned us against our developers. They need our help and its time we finally give it to them
---
Subtle in-game advertisement for gem store?
---
Hardware bans are useless. With emulating software today you can get around that.
---
The sad truth is, if the energy and motivation is there, the people who cheat and exploit will always find a way to do that.
---
Even a unique identification through your person won't help much because you could just use it of your parents or someone else that doesn't play the game.
---
me, 7 years ago: "gotta save each of these for something important!"
---
me today: "gotta save each of these for something important!"
---
Dev time and air time are not mutually exclusive. They can both exist at the same time perfectly fine.
---
 I would give legs 6/8. The fact that sucks about them is they are not connected to a revenant. I like the spirits of ritualist and would be nice to see goblins in epic armor with +10% damage buff purchased from gemstore under black friday sale in 2016 when guild wars 1 got update to kill the awakened dragons in queensdale known as kryta back then anyway much better than eye of the north expansion pack set fortunately though
---
Man, are u rly saying right now, that Falnder Sind,Sinderner and Co. plus Team USA are Cheating there win of the mATs?
---
its not like anet would pay tausends to have big streamer stream they game.
---
Fight for all the players who quit because they couldn't spend thousands of cash to purchase legendaries, materials and everything on the AH and didn't want to grind for 25 gold per hour because it translates into a slave work 2 € per hour job if you calculate it back to gems. Fight for all the players who quit the game because you achieve almost nothing by being good at it compared to dropping cash. After that, fight for the whales who thought their thousands were used to develop the game. Never do anything for Eanet for free.
---
&gt; Who cares about watching someone else play a game.
---
Millions of people, apparently.
---
The whole game is satire on how much you can miss your potential of a bigger mmo cause your management sucks
---
The day will soon come when you realize the truth behind these words. But you already do not care for the community and you won't then because you'll claim it doesn't effect you. And when the game officially dies, it will be because of people like you. Only one player stood to defend.
---
They did though
---
They’re a goal for when you already have everything else really...
---
Items that proactively invalidate any other gating for this item type till the end of the game cost a lot? What a surprise.
---
Same. I'm already at about 280 teleport to friends

If it is consistently broken there might be a systematic error behind it (eg key bind setting got messed up)

---
Yes and no.
---
If your build works for fractals, it will work for dungeons and open world, and zerker usually works for Fractals, Dungeons and Open World.
---
Raids and WvW might need vastly different builds though. 
---
Im pretty sure you wont raid or extensively play WvW for a bit though, so yes, zerker can be ok.
---
I'd recommend to go to metabattle.com and look for recommended builds for each game type and compare, if the builds are kind of similar and all atleast partly zerker, just go for it.
---
Yea, I as well remembered this was posted, but the typo in the title made it hard to find. GJ!
---
Begone furry.
---
You reached gw2 endgame. Actually there's nothing (meaningful) else to do. Try to find other game. Gw2 is good for new players and you're not new anymore.
---
Amen
---
And for the living worlds trinkets: i can farm them multiple times and get like 3 full sets over time?
---
Should I open champion loot boxes (the ones you get in pvp and wvw on a level 49-53 character?
---
Or are those okay to open on a level 80 character?
---
Obviously I'm trying to maximize my profit.
---
Really it shouldn’t even go away if you change maps because a mastery system that doesn’t work outside of specific maps is mostly useless. Especially after those maps die.
---
Okay, I'll bite. What makes you think that Anet needs you, a no-name middleman, to compile botting evidence in order to take action against it? There's already a report function in game that serves this exact purpose.
---
You jebaited me into thinking I was on Blade &amp; Soul reddit for a second there.
---
But the video picked the worst chair rewarded in-game. There are many others, that means it's a parody.
---
Where use them? I already have full bank and they start to taking inventory space..
---
If you unsheathe one of your weapons and then switch to the other (configured as hidden when sheathed) it does not appear. Also you seem to keep the aura of that weapon all the time, twilight in my case.
---
Please don't give them ideas.
---
I don't know, the pvp and wvw scene doesn't suit hearthstone viewers atm imo. Less bots might help. Also, this might sound weird but less selected skills might help due to less visual effects that hurt the eye.
---
Its under the table.
---
Some have it as part of their face, but I'd rather prefer some 5-days-stubble :&gt;
---
In fractals you kinda want to have access to various slaying or night sigils.
---
I feel like you missed the joke
---
Yeah, that's why I said you need 8 sigils and 7 runes per loadout.
---
&gt;Furthermore, if you **want to switch weapons** (whenever they fix the ejecting stuff on legendary weapons) you'll need even more :D
---
This paragraph basically means: if you want to switch weapons on the fly (using a greatsword instead axe / torch in weapon set 1, but keeping staff in weapon set 2), you'll need more if you want to cover everything.
---
Ooh an Eye of Kormir eater. Well, *another* eye of Kormir eater...

What a coincidence
---
Hi. Can you let people know your time zone? The us servers vary greatly so this will help you find someone with the same schedule
---
I'd personally chalk it up to 'clever use of game mechanics' instead--no one gets a benefit over anyone else to have the banners up indefinitely, it's something that benefits everybody.
---
Go buy some exotic armor and weapons and get eagle runes until you have enough for the scolar runes.
---
It's not that expensive in the trading Post.
---
On the bright side, all that coral you collect can be used to make amalgamated gemstones to either fund your next gen 2 legendary or sell for gold. Be glad you're grinding on something lucrative.
---
That is the new Fist-Fighter elite spec for Warrior.
---
I know this video is about something else but damn this cape looks good combined with heavy armor

If it's not permanent then it's a collectible, no exceptions

Ingame RP furries already scare me enough, don't give me more trauma.

I'm waiting for it, but even if you don'T make the date, it's not a biggy, we can make Secret NewToyMaker Special Edition in worst case :3
---
Make sure the project matches your own schedule!  
---
Good to have news otherwise!
---
No, it is a fun and engaging skill. /s
---
Eight. You need eight legendary sigils. Four for your land weapons and four for your underwater weapons.
---
I was wondering about this as well. Mine always goes back to the overview of the menus and it's driving me nuts, I always keep it at the equipment panel...
---
You're getting downvoted, but it's true. The only reason I went full legendary (fuck that ring) is to never care about gear ever again.
---
Reddit is my therapy hahaha
---
Have Mistlock Sanctuary pass, and just got the choice of a 2-week pass for a birthday gift...gonna save it for Wintersday and choose the royal terrace so I don't have to switch maps
---
To be fair they have more value as a  collector item than anything.
---
Are you stacked with the group? Most healers cant heal 10 players all over the place they want and some need you stacked tight in one spot or you wont be getting healed. If healers are the issue why dont you gear up a healer and carry? It could be bad comps (are you splitting healers up into different subgroups?) Are the healers taking the proper traits and have proper gear with monk runes and food? Is everyone just running around out everywhere expecting heals or are you stacked with the healer? Is the healer dedicated to torches? If so pull them off. Do you have designated torches? You say you are in "Damaging AOE" you talking about the circles right? You **have** to dodge them, you cannot tank them just like many different mechanics in raids. You cant face tank a VG or Cairn blue, a sloth shake, Demios Mind crush and oil, you cant ignore KC greens or his donut, gorse retaliation, sab flak etc. The list goes on and on and on. Pull 2 healers, if you need more healing pull in a healing tempest, more cleanses a heal scrapper swap your composition around and work on what you are lacking, which seems to be heals and dodging the AOE's.
---
it's not working.
---
Which have nothing to do with the hair?

Praise our dredge comrades. This is true socialism in action. If they were capitalistic culture, they would have 7 managers, a management board, a ceo, cfo and others and all the real work would be done by only one of them in the picture.

I wish they hadn't removed the daily racing category :(.

The maps with coral nodes worth farming (from memory) include Bitterfrost Frontier, Sandswept Isles, Siren's Landing, and Crystal Oasis. The good news is that drops from coral nodes are quite valuable and you can make some nice money while doing the collection.
---
You're not giving them the benefit of the doubt, you're assuming they would give the worst case scenario excuse, and you're assuming everything is so bad nothing can be changed.
---
You're the kind of person who would scream capes and dyeable back items were impossible a few days ago, shutting down any kind of discussion or feedback. Your attitude hurts the game.
---
I guess they didn't update loot tables for them. Send a bug report.
---
Literally buttcapes.
---
&gt; I think the DSD could potentially be the "mother" Kralk was talking about and be more powerful than the other Elder Dragons.
---
You're not the first to suggest that the DSD is "Mother", but I disagree. All evidence we have suggests that the six Elder Dragons are equals to each other. This is why there's been a balance between them for eons - they're not allied, but none ever got strong enough to fight another 1 on 1 and have a sure victory, so they've avoided contact with each other.
---
&gt; Think about the domain of the DSD, it's territory/potential territory makes up most of Tyria (the world, not the continent) whereas all the others only generally have a big chunk of land.
---
We don't have a clue how big its territory is. It doesn't command the entire Unending Ocean (which is equivalent to Earth's four oceans). It just woke up in one specific part of the Unending Ocean and has remained within the ocean. All evidence suggests that it has remained relatively close to its awakening point, and doesn't command the entire Unending Ocean - if it did, then even shallow waters by now would be dangerously full of its minions, yet we can send ships to Istan, Gandara, and the Ring of Fire with ease still, and Dragonfall had no effect on it.
---
Nothing at all suggests that the DSD is acting any differently than, say, Jormag, who moved slowly over time from point A (awakening point - far north of the norn lands, probably near the Furious Stretch given it scattered the kodan) to point B (the tundra just north of Bitterfrost Frontier) over years (at least four years of blizzards passed before it forced the norn out).
---
&gt; It's also worth noting that the DSD and it's minions are described as tentacled horrors, which if true, is quite drastically different from the other dragons.
---
Not that different. Destroyers can be described as "insectoid horrors" due to having insect features, despite being made of rock and magma. Its minions are known to be made out of water, which places it just like Primordus in how it crafts minions.
---
The DSD itself isn't said to have tentacles, btw. That's Primordus. ;)
---
&gt; It would be nigh-impossible for anyone to know if some crazy powerful Cthulhu-type fucker from the Mists popped in and killed the DSD and absorbed all of its power somewhere in the deep ocean where nobody's around to know about it.
---
Well, everything we know would imply that cannot even happen. The entire point of stopping Balthazar - which by rights is himself a "crazy powerful Cthulhu-type fucker from the Mists" (being a non-living hard-to/impossible-to-comprehend being made of mystical, foreign, energy capable of taking any form he desired) - from killing Primordus / Kralkatorrik was because he could not replace the Elder Dragons in the All. We know from Omadd's Machien vision, as well as Taimi's simulation and the Exalted/Forgotten/Glint's plans that the DSD's domains in the All are still active and well, which indicates that what we have is indeed a Tyrian "high dragon" acting in the role of an Elder Dragon.
---
While the DSD could have heavy Lovecraftian influences in its appearance, and be a non-standard dragon by far, all lore suggests that foreign entities simply cannot become Elder Dragon replacements, so we have a **very** high bet that the DSD is native to Tyria like the other Elder Dragons.
---
might just be random bad luck. Its one of ten items on a random chance to roll on table along with weapon recipes. So first have to get the table, then it has to hit the item. chances might well be less than 1 in 100 which would cover 3 months before you should have hit it acc to probability - IF we assign 10% chance for table and for crystals. they could well be lower.

Implying ArenaNet needs outside help to destroy their own game lmao.
---
Common recommendations include:
---
- [Copper-Fed Salvage-o-Matic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Copper-Fed_Salvage-o-Matic): a salvage kit that never runs out
---
- [Character Slot Expansion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Character_Slot_Expansion): allows you to have more characters
---
- [Bank Tab Expansion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bank_Tab_Expansion): gives you an extra 30 slots of Bank space
---
- [Living World Season 3 Complete Pack](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_3_Complete_Pack])/[Season 4 Complete Pack](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_4_Complete_Pack): each comes with story content and 6 new maps
---
A less popular suggestion that I just personally like:
---
- [Living World Season 2 Complete Pack](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_2_Complete_Pack): you don't get a new map with this because those maps are already accessible to you, but I like some of the storytelling here (especially "Seeds of Truth"), and it's a better introduction to Heart of Thorns than just skipping it
---
Endless tools (pickaxe and logging axe at the very least) are always a nice quality of life; having to either fill up your inventory with tools or running out of uses in the middle of farming really sucks.  And of course bank and bag spaces are always nice... you'll eventually need it anyway with the stuff you can accumulate.
---
Depends on what you want your bot to do, defend something properly? Probably not. Running into a camp and capture it, probably yes.
---
The lounge choosy box can be vendored!
---
dude are you okay
---
&gt;.&lt; we need less bots in wvw so the actual game pop is honest. hehe
---
Also implying they care about PvP or WvW
---
So Reddit is in on the plot to destroy guildwars2?
---
I love these spam bots sometimes lmao
---
Nice!  I understood that reference.  Watched the cartoon growing up, I even remember watching the Christmas special w He-Man!
---
How is this "clear"? Also mobile games are the most lucrative. In fact mmo's are very expensive.
---
Firebrand is the most similar to monk that you can get. It even got a Reversal of Fortune-like mechanic with the trait Pure of Heart in Honor. When aegis that you applied blocks an attack the target gets healed.
---
Dude, this game is 95% pve, 5% pvp.
---
Even if your claims were true nothing would happen to the game
---
And a set of permanent tools.
---
i'm tottaly unsatisfied by the last 6 to 8 mounth of "content", and am probably not the only one, especially when looking at all the talk about it.
---
Saying that gw2 is a great MMORPG is true, saying that it is a mmorpg where you can invest in if false. That's sad, devastating becasue i did invest a lot in it, but that is how it is.
---
So looking at it now, i can't in my right mind advise anyone to put money into this game, not while anet is in this pr bullshit and dev hell.
---
This is how the human-charr conflict escalates.
---
gw2 is a great game as of right now, the issu is that there is nothing to indulge in.
---
Anet "give" us story once in a blue moon, but the story is not something to do for a long time, the achievment are boring stuff for them to say "look we give you content", the collection for skins are interesting, but when you see that they put sooooo much more efforts into the cash shop than into the game it's a little bit distressing.
---
The only RPers I know have their own guilds.
---
Can you give me some contacts maybe or guild names?
---
the 5 skill is full block stance, the 4 skill reduced dmg and at enough  "heat" does reflect projectiles. heat is holo's special source and u need to keep an eye on it, since after it is full it kicks u out of the spec  
---
l holosmith-mode. still when the bar goes down after this happened u have the option to use boosted regular attacks.
---
each shield skill is also usable for an attack variant. 4 skill can push/cc, 5 skill has kinda boomerang animation.
---
I puked in my mouth.
---
I still have my welcome to gw2 mail
---
Same here with german community but that's normal. The christmas times are always a bit empty cause everyone travels home to their families
---
Still got all my goodies from when the game released and beta stuff. I think that's where the "I'll need this one day" started or maybe all those final fantasy potions I never used
---
But it became empty months ago
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

[Candy Corn Gobbler](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Candy_Corn_Gobbler) - only available during Halloween. It allows you to get any booster for "free." The most useful one is XP Kill Streak. If you WvW, PvP, or key farm without just using Tomes to level up, it is very useful. (Key Farm is to make a brand new character and complete the level 10 Personal Story Quest for a Black Lion Key. Can only be done once per week.)

At least the Oasis means free travel to the Pinata :D

Inventory Wars 2
---
me today: already have permanent bank accesss and cant be bothered to take it jsut to delete it
---
Sure. I do agree with you. They’re basically the ultimate money/time sink.
---
There's also that mordrem in the bottom of the rata novus that is transformed but seems to sorta be able to fight it there.
---
I'm just wondering if something along the lines of a ritual + friendship and appeals would be what we do.
---
Like, you have to break the connection first. But that alone isn't enough because many joined willingly
---
If you're a fan of having to use multiple skills to do crazy combos then I highly recommend Engineer. 
---
It has a lot of variety depending on how you build it and is a decent pick in all game modes.
---
If you wanna add even more variety to it then get a power and a condi damage set of gear to swap between. Then you can run around on dual pistol and use the new templates to swap to power if you feel like it.
---
When Heart of Thorns launched, only Airship Cargo gave Airship Parts for opening it, because events didn't directly reward Airship Parts at the time.  For both Auric Basin and Tangled Depths, completing events was the only method of earning the zone currencies Aurillium and Ley Line Crystals, and the Exalted Chests and Crystallized Supply Caches never dropped any.
---
After some months, when they did the rewards pass on Heart of Thorns zones/metas and improved the rewards to where they are today, they enabled Aurillium drops from the Exalted Chests and Ley Line Crystal drops from Crystallized Supply Caches.  However, that never got added to the home instance versions of the items, which still drop what they used to before.
---
I watch streamers because the streamers themselves make it intreresting, are funny and/or knowledgable, whatever. 
---
That's probably why teapot and WP have a pretty huge following, they add character to what they do, whether you like their character or not, but people probably watch them 80% for their personality and 20% for GW2, at most.
---
I would guess that this goes for most game streams though.
---
First off, you might consider the guardian elite spec, Firebrand. It has much more depth than vanilla guard or Dragonhunter spec but it is still extremely powerful and great for group content.  
---
  
---
In my view, Necromancer and Reaper are quick to go stale as well. Not sure about the newer spec, Scourge.  
---
Ranger has the bonus of the druid spec, which feels very different to play than vanilla Ranger.  
---
Engineer does have a lot of depth, a high skill ceiling, and some interesting new mechanics in the elite specs, especially holosmith.  
---
The other classes I might recommend if you like a challenge would be elementalist, especially weaver, and Mesmer.
---
tyvm
---
TYVM
---
Tyvm
---
Not long enough to have those unfortunately, but I read you can test drive the class for a bit at 80 before committing so I’ll likely do that.
---
OP had invested too much into the collection for him to just forgo and buy it on tp.
---
He literally states the reasoning that was given to him as well as how quickly his thread was removed and he was suspended. But you only read for what, two maybe three seconds?
---
Go ahead and post an image with names on the official forums. You won't get a suspension, just an infraction point. In fact, post evidence of hacking to replicate what he did. Same result. The thread will be removed and you will be warned.
---
He was immediately suspended with no given infraction points and his thread had two others that also sighted the SAME individual. Someone doesn't want the name to get out and its very suspicious.
---
Correct. When you use the ticket it pops you to 80 and puts you in the silverwastes. You can spend as much time there as you without finalizing the ticket usage.
---
I thought of this.  
---
https://youtu.be/Jgjw0aEKFJs
---
I forget if you have to bring a character to level 80 before you can try their Elites in the pvp area but if you're playing mostly open world and WvW try a thief in there and all the weapon combos and maybe look up some videos of Daredevil and Deadeye. At least keep the idea of a thief on the back burner for your next level 80, DE is perfect for that mood and Daredevil is the most fluid and natural feeling build I've played in most games. 
---
Whichever profession you go with, my WvW build usually works out for open world pve since I build to face groups and cover and revive my groups and squads, large fights are kind of similar when some boss and add mechanics start downing multiple players. 
---
You might want to look up some builds and vids for raids and other modes a bit anyway though to see what some focused builds might feel like because you never know what you might get into later on.
---
Its fine, just not the top weapon pick
---
South park season 18 or so dealt with this.was a Xmas episode too. As a "old man" naive 5 years old (as in the episode)there is no reason to watch others play instead of doing yourself but for a guide about something you should learn.Didn't you see the show ?. This will give cartman even more power to rule the world.
---
I watch guide on JP for example and God bless the collections video but watchi f someone play ? Nor here or in any other game I simply cannot get it

---
&gt;That's probably why teapot and WP have a pretty huge following, they add character to what they do
---
This! I always just play them in the background while doing other stuff or playing the game, lol rarely cared the actual gameplay.
---
DH is definitly not "on top of the damage charts" in fact it loses out to a bunch of classes on its own.
---
I'd move them over to a bag opener, yeah. I don't move the Hero's chests from HoT (auto opens at 80) and the bags from POF (most of them also open at 80), but PVP/WVW chests are more like standard champ boxes.
---
it varies a lot in instances, I've seen rukiton fountain area filled with RPers, same with salem, and other times empty. once you find a good instance with people in it, ask around for an RP guild
---
Oh yes. Big ups to mostly sociopaths who have low-key narsicism and actually get off to the idea they are going to leade a SW chest farm and know all the the locations before anyone else.
---
People keep bringing up this "convenience".
---
You know what is more convenient? Not harvesting at all. ~30000 harvests or 600 gold in your pocket and hours of your game time? Not to even mention the difference if you do harvest with normal tools or play alts and always have to reequip these tools on them.
---
But hey dont let me stop you. More cheap downvotes and mats on the TP for me and more money in ANETs pockets.
---
some people might use a macro for stuff like this, but since it's not allowed, I can't recommend it :P
---
I play casually, but like to collect everything on a map before moving on to the next map. The unbound magic and volatile magic tools have saved me a huuuge amount of time in buying all the collectibles in living story maps. And, I’m more than happy to support a game that I get a lot of free leisure time from.
---
Mordrem Guard aren't actually corrupted. They're more akin to the Sons of Svanir than other dragon minions like Icebrood or Branded.
---
This is because the sylvari's connection to the Dream of Dreams prevents dragon corruption - even Mordremoth's. The entire concept of "the call" was that Mordremoth was using his own connection to the Dream of Dreams to hijack the Wyld Hunt's (and Dark Hunt's) channels in order to communicate telepathically with sylvari. Mordremoth first used subtle whispers disguised as each individual sylvari's own thoughts (as we see with Scarlet and Occam), and when that didn't work began communicating normally like Jormag is doing now, and when that didn't work (as we see with Canach) he just beguns bombarding them with loud messages.
---
For this same reason that the Mordrem Guard aren't "recorrupted", they could (but not necessarily will) turn back to normal once they are separated from Mordremoth's overwhelming mental presence.
---
&gt; I'm just wondering if something along the lines of a ritual + friendship and appeals would be what we do.
---
Yes. With Glint, it's said that even after the ritual she continued to defend Kralkatorrik, until her ability to read minds made her sympathetic to those she was killing.
---
It should also noted there is an alternative to these obscure and expensive rituals and exotic magic: Killing the Elder Dragon itself. As we see with the risen in Siren's Landing, some can now be tamed. But some also still faithfully serve Zhaitan, even though all risen were forced and did not willingly join.
---
i find watching gw2 twitches boring unless the host is interesting. i cant tell what is going on in a large battle unless the host is giving a play by play narration
---
Oo super nice. 
---
Hope you are using Save the Queen or the Shining Blade. Would fit perfectly esp with the 2002 He-Man style.
---
Sure, but the core of his comment remains true; guardian as a class is really strong across every single game mode and not particularly difficult to play either.
---
If you switch tabs (equipment, wardrobe, minis etc.) it doesn't save this. If you close your hero panel and open it again, it is back to the tab selection.
---
However, it does save your tab, if you open them in any other way than using your hero panel. Like using a skin item, which automatically opens you wardrobe. If you do so, it will save your wardrobe tab.
---
At leats that's what I figured out so far.

---
How wrong can you be?
---
DH doesn't stomp shit in average raids lol, phases are way too long. In fact a "tryhard static group like snowcrows" only uses DH because the phases are so short, because they need fast vulnerability in splits and to remove the need of a support class. In a raid static group you can easily play most "meta" dps builds easily because of how close they are.  
---
Is DH's rotation easy, yes but guess what, so are a lot of other classes if you remove trying to maximize your dps to the absolute fullest
---
Going to be noob Qs, just picked back up after testing it awhile ago. Leveling a ranger to druid atm (main healers/support in most games and game genres). What is another profession I can level for Dps? What is the best way I can have my druid for dps when I don't do healing - conditional ranger? Lastly what's the best use of lvl 80 boost?

Sure works great!

Edit: if I remember correctly its took me 15+wiped before I got my first raid kill, which is vg, and that was like 3-4years ago. Now I'm can say that I'm pretty comfortable on all of the bosses.
---
Hello, I'm playing my mesmer again after 3 years (left around the time the first raid came out, i think i may have beaten the first boss). What are some of the things I should know and check out?
---
I have enough gold and gems stored up, seems like there wasn't much inflation change and most items are still affordable. 
---
-What should i concentrate on regarding gear wise, go for legendary armor?
---
-Any items I should buy from gem store?
---
-Where do I go to continue the story line? Do I have to buy the living story?
---
-I have various 5, 6, and 7 year anniversary gifts, anything in particular that I should look for and save for future items?
---
-Where do I go to find a good raiding guild? US Late night West coast player
---
Any other advice is greatly appreciated.
---
Thank you,
---
Money makers gonna get gated. I wish as well. XD
---
I've noticed lately that a lot of the gear setups on metabattle for open world have changed from using Superior Sigil of Accuracy to Superior Sigil of Impact.  Why is that?  Especially on builds that have few, if any, skills with knockback.  Is the +3% dmg that much better than the +7% crit chance?
---
Any mastery track that is visible needs to be completed in order for you to gain Spirit Shards again.
---
Any mastery track that is invisible will get visible once you start it, and then also needs to be completed. As long as it is invisible it does not hinder you from getting Spirit Shards.
---
Thus getting and completing the Griffon won't help your current situation. You'll need to get the Beetle and Crystal Champion tracks done.
---
&gt; Guild wars 2 is totally fine to watch (as every other game) if it comes to design etc, etc. 
---
Are you a fan of "eating at a public place / walking my dog" streams? Seems so, because the only decent streams to watch during the years were the raiding tourneys.
---
Looks cool!  Now that there are capes, I'm really hoping someone will make a Thor norn! :D
---
Getting an execution is actually huge in sPvP in certain situation. There is already enough ways to get people back up we don't need to make it even harder to kill players. It just stalls fights.
---
Is this about relatively low turnouts when GW2 officially streams stuff like WvW?  
---
I tried to pop in the last time they were streaming WvW and I was falling asleep in my seat.  
---
GW2 streaming is only interesting if the people hosting it are also interesting. Webcams of heads just staring at their stream and only blurting a few instructions once in a while is not interesting.  If you're presenting yourself as more boring than it would be if you were to pop into a random WvW discord yourself and join up, you're doing it wrong.
---
No, you misunderstand. They do not drop AT ALL in the home instance.
---
Entertaining hosts aside, GW2 is not very good to watch because so many skills can be used at the same time in so little time, that hardly anyone can really see what's what's going on unless they are experienced veterans, in which case they will be more likely to watch things like WvW,  SPvP or raids, which is precisely  what most people watch when they are not watching a particular streamer.  
---
If you watch most other games, there's always a rythm, it doesn't matter if the character is as fast as Chipp Zanuff or Tracer, or as sluggish as the TF2 heavy or the capcom Juggernaut. There's always a rythm that allows any player watching to eventually get used to the game pace and follow it.    
---
GW2 has so many skills with no activation time and no aftercast, that it has become a spamfest. And players have gotten to used to that that they would not enjoy the game as much if the pace was properly adjusted.  
---
Generally, players prefer the playing experience over watching experience because when it's you who is playing, you always know what you are doing even if you can't see anything in the middle of all the flashes. You are the one pressing the buttons.  
---
But if you have to watch someone else, way too often it'll be a mess of flashes and explosions. 
---
Just look at anyone playing a greatsword dragon hunter. There's no freaking way anyone can see exactly what's going on in all that white and blue all over the screen that can't be reduced even disabling shaders and postprocessing. Fights with that build go basically like "lights out, somebody dies" trope, but instead going out, the lights go over 9000 lumens.
---
That happens because the game won't load the visuals of the weapon until it needs to show them, and it sometimes skips that and they don't get loaded at all. 
---
Stowing the weapon and taking it out again or weapon-swapping a few times usually fixes it.
---
is this even still going on
---
Painted beards do not count.
---
Or how you get hybrids.
---
I don't get this argument at all.  If you actually follow this argument I guess no one plays Fortnite, WoW, LoL, DotA or anything and, apparently, Ultima Online and Everquest have MASSIVE populations because they have such a low Twitch viewer count everyone must be playing them.
---
I didn't say it wasn't a bug. I said why the bug happens.
---
I really have to buy an episode to continue gaining experience? That seems like awful design. thanks for the info
---
I think it's more that they just forgot that a weapon can be unsheated also by swaping. Because like I said, it happens everytime.
---
On the other hand, I problably misunderstood you, sorry for that.
---
Thanks anet for bringing this amazing content. Thanks for wasting my time on this fcking bullshit. 
---
No wonder this game doesnt move anywhere. Maybe they should fire fire game designed for poor decisions. Ohw8.
---
Yes, they don't. It's more of "PC and NPC ambient dialogue without menus during the talking" and choices come up as dialog boxes or NPC interactions.
---
stopped playing wvw due to warclaws
---
I just tried it. There are no mechanics, you just get constant aoe damage and die. That was my experience. Good job anet
---
Since the pitchfork horde here on reddit will talk him down or make his try uncomfortable i dont see this happen.
---
If I was to guess, it was probably a creative decision to show your character's face, since you know, it makes sense in this format. The other commenter is just making shit up without anything as proof. I'm not aware of the developers ever giving any insight about this.
---
Story is the most boring part of GW2. Why watch a video of s/o watching cutscenes?
---
There's no yt content creators because there's no worthwhile yt content to create.
---
The reason you quit last year will give you the answer to your question.
---
I always use these right away so I can grab the tomes from my bank and do the tutorial at lvl 80.
---
I don't watch streams on Twitch for any games. And I won't. Most of the Twitch content is PvP based and that is a game mode that holds no interest for me. Why would I watch it? I also don't see the point in watching people do something I can have more fun going and doing myself. Maybe I am a philistine in that regard, but I don't think I am alone either.
---
Then there is YT which I tend to use as a resource for things I need to know and want to find out more about. WP's recent series on Open World builds/gear etc is the most valuable resource I have found so far. I will look to this when I make a new profession for sure.
---
If I need to find out how to get to some place, how to do a particular thing or a certain achievement I will search YT for a guide. Dulfy (no longer active I believe) and Aiyan Maiden are my go to's. They just do it all so well.
---
My advice would be to think about who your audience will be and what they will want, rather than what you want to create. Some games simply don't lend themselves to streaming or recording of simple gameplay (outside of PvP) and I think GW2 is one of them.
---
You might need a time machine.
---
I see. That's disappointing. Anet generally have q good track record for making things fair and accessible. Forcing you to buy the seasons to gain exp seems strange
---
Stack the bags from them in the bank and open loads at once it’s really satisfying

I think the Griffon needs to be unlocked and maxed. I don't think you need to do the episode for the beetle or the Season for the skyscale. But Griffon is a part of the PoF expansion so would count for that.
---
At least that's how it worked for me. I was getting spirit shards until I started on the LWS. After I finished beetle but before I unlocked skyscale I was getting them again. 
---
Griffon is less tedious than skyscale but is much more costly in terms of gold. I do love the griffon though, it maintains altitude much better than skyscale and I will continue to use it in some situations. I recommend unlocking it, particularly if you  don't intend to get skyscale any time soon. I find it very worthwhile.
---
Your clones are very impressive

You’re thinking ley line dust.

I used to. I used to have an entire character (well, still do) dedicated to processing useless materials with eaters, but at a certain point you realise that it is a pointless waste of time; you only get 99.9% garbage anyway, so it's faster to just delete the stacks.
---
I hate when content creators make "music videos". For one thing, I am 99.9% sure none of the artists are being paid for using their music. They MIGHT get a credit for it, but...seems like a crappy way to pump up your own content w/o getting their express permission first. And yeah, as you may have guessed, I am also a musician, so I get salty about that sort of thing.

I've only been playing a few weeks, but there's a ton of stuff to do if you're a *mostly casual* like me. I've played SWTOR and WoW as well as Warhammer and AoC in the past, GW2 is pretty legit overall.
---
I've accidentally activated most of mine (not paying attention, double-clicked the wrong thing - I really shouldn't keep them next to the salvage kits). The fact that it lasts EXACTLY two weeks (whether you're logged in or not) means that I'll probably never use the few that survive.
---
This reminds me of the time when centaur slaying sigils shot up into the stratosphere in gold prices after the sigil/rune rework. That resulted in basically all slaying sigils to get a flat damage boost that was now the optimal secondary sigil...but only the centaur one shot up in price on the tp because that was the one that Snow Crows randomly put on their builds pages
---
Some interesting points, and I also think you're right in that last aspect. 
---
YouTube is more of a hobby of mine, and nothing I plan to do full time. I don't really mind if my videos don't get a lot of views, since the making of the videos is what's most fun to me 😊
---
I had the same thing with greatsword on my hunter, it only started happening since the latest patch. It's definitely because of the new hiding weapons feature. It might be other weapons too, but to be honest I haven't played much at all lately, I only played about with the feature on that character briefly.
---
I thought it might have been sorted with whatever they fixed to do with PvP and hiding weapons, but I guess not.
---
Especially the potions... if its wine, they will taste extremely delicious and expensive with age.
---
Returning player here. Had stopped playing after PoF and now back in a big way. Can't stress enough that even I have tons of stuff I can do. When I started playing again all I read was doom and gloom the game is dying yet yesterday I meet a HP train and get my necro to a reaper within 2 hours. Watched the woddenpotatos video and found the overflow trading network, joined an affiliated guild and now I've something to work towards for amassing gold and eventually getting legendarys for my toons. Today I leveled a craft to 400 to help with that. I guess the end end game is lacking but wasn't that always a problem with GW2? Still, I've fractals, raids and strike missions (don't even know what they are) to look forward to and with all that I don't have a feeling of being rushed like other MMOs. Great game, wished I never stopped playing tbh lol.
---
Why tho? Gbanks have this feature but they are shared so they have a reason to have get named to indicate what goes where... I'm sure you can remember your own categories
---
Anet, could throw in the ability to move tabs around while you're at it. k thx.
---
This just started happening to me today. I never use minis but I got the Boneskinner mini and displayed it. Since then, hero panel opens to the minis tab everytime.
---
Don't ever say something out of emotions, there is a risk you will miss something.
---
Factions would bring so many players back!
---
it's backwards for me haha. I open the game and end up just wanting to watch a stream instead.
---
I'm a a GW1 fanboy myself but OP makes no sense.
---
Maclaine Diemer and Kuraine are fantastic composers who absolutely achieve emotions with their music. For pete sake, half of the HoT music was composed by the same person who composed Celeste.
---
Music is not one of GW2's weak points. It's one of its strengths, along with its art style.  (We can complain about gameplay, but NEVER bash its music!)
---
hey, for key runs the airship is best friend XD (does key run up to 40 currently)
---
r/unexpectedwarframe
---
that's how nostalgia works, look at the WoW classic.
---
Old shit gets a reskin, instead of something new and original... that's pushing everything forward, right?
---
Naming bank tabs, Linsey Murdock said something along the lines of "never" (even if the community wants it??)
---
But what hasn't yet been rejected is "hiding bank tabs" like hiding bags. I need this, because static sizes of bank tabs are ridiculous and those headers just get in the way.
---
The Gw2 soundtrack is fine lmao; you're complaining about the wrong thing
---
It's a design choice. This is the base game we are talking about. If they wanted you to have headgear on during them, they would have designed it that way.
---
We don't have to like it, but that's why it is the way it is. It's not about spaghetti code, engine limits, bugs, etc. This is the way they wanted the cutscenes, and why they haven't changed it.
---
For newcomers there are income issues. It feels very hard getting things done as you are overwhelmed by horizontality and low price of farmable things. Look at ectoplasm prices for example...
---
ley-line sparks. But yes, not the ley line currency.
---
Yeah that lol. But yeah no crystals from it, which sucks. Mostly cuz I fuckin hate that map and would rather not have to deal with it anymore.
---
Like 4 (edit 6 for Hot ost) out of 50 was composed by her. And bro when we talk about the music, it's really about how it makes someone feel. Music is irrational and that's why it makes us united in it. If someone like Lena, Maclaine, Jeremy, then let them. The only problem that music causes is "my music is better than yours" kind of thing. so it gets rationalized, and it destroys the music's purpose
---
Honestly if you last played a year ago you probably won't find that much has changed in Guild Wars 2 today.
---
There's been one new fractal. 
---
There's been one new raid. 
---
They decided to add a mount to wvw.
---
There have been either 3 or 4 new living story episodes added (I guess 3.5 or 4.5 if you count the prologue) depending on how long one year means to you, and each of these has a new map.
---
Pvp is largely the same as it's always been.
---
It really depends on how much you did the last time you played. The amount of content in GW2 is absolutely massive considering the base game is free. You have the entirety of expansionless Tyria to explore with 8 classes and 5 races, each with a personal story to run through (that largely does get the same at the end).
---
There are achievements you can hunt down or play Fashion Wars 2 with the wardrobe if you want. Some people like to just play meta events and that's fine if you like working with a ton of other players in a pve environment. Most of those are still being run as well. You're still going to find other players throughout the world competing events and leveling up or farming.
---
But just because there's a ton of content doesn't mean that it's enjoyable to run. It really depends on the person. If you want something with more substance than just living world maps every few months you're going to find yourself a bit burnt out after you run out of the content that *is* enjoyable to you.
---
Running the same pvp maps with the same meta for months if not years on end can get a bit repetitive. The same can be applied to wvw and to some extent open world pve. Some people never tire of that and they can just play that type of content over and over. If that's you, then you'll be fine.
---
It feels like GW2 is just a game to come back to after a few months. I don't really think it can be played on and on and on if you're  not one of those players that is completely captured by the repetitiveness of open world events or wvw or pve or constantly changing your characters' looks.
---
I do think it's a bit deceptive to pretend like Guild Wars 2 isn't losing players, though. Casual players who most often play open world and don't care about raids or climbing pvp ladders will keep coming back to the game but many veteran players seem tired of the lack of content. These are the players that are leading the open world meta events or the raids or the custom player events that eventually stop playing.
---
Not every open world meta event has a commander. Some aren't run at all. Some you only find people willing to run it right after the dailies reset. You end up with a bunch of players who *want* to do something but none of them actually knows how to organize and lead it.
---
So it depends on the reason you quit playing the game in the first place. If it's for lack or content or genuine uninterest, you might have a really short burst of interest in playing the game but for the most part it's just going to be the same.
---
&gt;Like 4 out of 50 was composed by her. 
---
Wrong.
---
Actually the soundtrack is one of the only reasons I log in to GW2 every now and then. So it's not like Soule did a worse job in GW2 than he did in GW1.
---
tarir, mordremoth, tarir, hearts and minds
---
ok 6 xd
---
Golden cave, octovine, exalted lullaby, auric wilds, to name a few. Most of the soundtrack on youtube is mislabelled. 
---
HoT actually had three composers, with the lesser known one doing the battle themes instead of either Maclaine or Kuraine. (It may be Stan LePard but someone please correct me.)
---
While nostalgia was the main reason why people swarmed the Classic servers, it's the mechanics that held them there (now, after a certain period of time).
---
But I think what Harmagg meant was simply an expac that's stationed in Cantha, so we could see how GW2 reinterprets it, much like how it reinterpreted Elona. It wouldn't be backwards thinking to include older lore to the game, because as time goes on it feels weirder and weirder how disconnected Cantha is from the rest of the world and story (though there is the lore excuse with the isolationist emperor).
---
While we don't know specifics about the code for gw2 they have said numerous times that it's not exactly easy for them to go back and change things especially when the people who wrote the code in the first place have left and they have no idea what might/might not break if they start messing with it. Gw2 legitimately has spaghetti code judging by everything we know about it that anet would rather leave be than risk messing with it.
---
still it's not even half of it, besides she admitted at some point she got direction from Maclaine, not going to undervalue Lena, hell no, but Maclaine made this game's music as good as it should have been since 2012.
---
"ANet, read the comments on a video that pirated your OST."
---
Very smart...
---
just because you can remember doesnt mean it wouldnt be nice to not have to remember... some people compact all their bank tabs so it would be nice to be able to see which tab is which without having to expand each one, especially if you have a lot of tabs.
---
