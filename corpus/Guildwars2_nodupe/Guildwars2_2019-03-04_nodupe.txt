Jesus, some of the people in this thread are just assholes. Anyway, thanks again for organizing the even BluJasmine. Hopefully, we will see many future community based events like this.

I let him do that because i was recording all his angry whisper. He was so mad that it was actually amusing.  
---
The issue is that wvw have more toxic conversations than normal ones. I guess that my accounts are all in the worst servers, however i can't even remotely think of wvw as a normal/friendly place at all. 
---
This is why i wanted to correct your statement. If you ever played that many hours, you would have noticed that already.
---
Agreed - confusion is becoming less of a signature condition of the mesmer every patch between f2 nerf round 2 + axe 3.

Dungeons are some of the best gold per hour in the game, only being beaten by Flipping, Raidselling, and Fractal 96 farming with T3/T4 fractal titles. There are a couple bugs that hinder your gold per hour too, being DR from going too fast, and certain [Dungeon Recipes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Category:Dungeon_trinkets) not dropping.
---
A "simple" fix to these two bugs could help the dungeon scene grow and more people to find static tour groups. **The key to have the dungeon scene grow without Arenanet needing to help is to stop spreading misinformation about dungeons.**
---
Dungeons aren't very rewarding when you pug them, I get it. I don't think people will try to say they are rewarding. Don't get focused on that, its just like comparing fractal farming with pugs as opposed to statics or other organized groups, but no one does that comparison.
---
its the problem. why should i join a traning discord? isnt it easier to create a finder? join discord, fill form, wait a week if u can find a place, get ready to raid.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
what about click instantly to "find" button and get you in raid in minutes &amp; seconds? u guys can keep go on with normal &amp; cm raids. finder system wont touch you.
---
why you are acting like this is gonna burn your raiding?
---
its okey, there is a same system on wow. newbies always do lfr,  others if have some experience do heroics &amp; mythic raids.
---
simple as hell man. whats the problem here? asking an lfr system is %100  faultless .
---
it wont hurt you, it wont hurt your raiding, it wont hurt your loots. its just some more work for anet, thats all.
---
Personally, I feel like they marked dungeons as "complete." Due to scaling issues with mobs, rebalancing them to raise difficulty is probably off the table. General drops  from dungeons really aren't that bad. There's already the gold reward from doing 8 random dungeon paths. I do like the idea of a universal currency for dungeons like fractals but I don't see it happening. As far as party issues, I haven't noticed any issues with forming parties. It's true that you never see parties forming in LFG to join. However, any time I've ever added a group, it fills up in a heartbeat. Especially if you mark it with little to no requirements (ie Experienced or Speed Clear vs all welcome). I doubt they'd add a a queue for bonus rewards as they reward players for the content played and not just "to be played."
---
Oh shit, you mean you can still hear us all the way down there?
---
Thanks, i already can tell there is going to have a lot of different music style in it =)
---
People play HoT for the loot and nothing else, the metas have been worked out to a science nowadays so it sure isn't for any kind of challenge, and nothings fun the 100+ time you do it. Anet could release content that is literally walking down a featureless hallway for 5 irl minutes with a chest at the end with a 0.0001% chance of dropping some really shiny infusion and there'll be more players standing in that hallway than in the PoF maps.
---
Kids are kids ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
you don't need x class but you need y support which pretty much every class can provide
---
just because people are lazy and let the condition removal to the druid, the reflects to mesmer and the cc to warrior means nothing..
---
while certain things like boonstrips aren't as easily available to every class they all can chip in some team support to get through in another way
---
Unplayable.
---
While I am all for more dungeon support from the official side, the changes you propose are not necessary and the "problems" you state are just not true.
---
Dungeons are really lucrative if done right!! There are two ways:
---
1. Skip basically everything you can and finish the path as fast as you can (more effective if premade 5man).
---
2. Kill everything on the way. Since dungeons released power creep and rising skill level make dungeons a breeze for meta builds and the mobs give good loot (especially t3/t4 mats are worth a lot).
---
Dungeon LFGs fill reasonably fast (within 5min) for every dungeon except Arah maybe. No need to develop a dev time expensive system that may or may not get used anyway.
---
What is needed is to bugfix existing dungeons. Make condis work on structures like in fractals and make explorable paths for the epic story dungeons they are releasing recently for living world episodes.
---
It's not even out Yet. Play with it for an hour and see. Christ

Still trying to get to the point where I can casually enjoy PVP, but still almost every game [looks like this.](http://puu.sh/CUHDE/1c549b9701.jpg)
---
Is PVP just this inaccessible at this point? I'm not sure I want it to be a focus but it would be kind of fun to dabble in if it weren't always like this.
---
I have set up a PVP build and read a guide, but still we just get demolished, I do no damage, the enemies just explode me, I'm constantly losing 1v2s, 1v3s, etc.
---
10/10
---
u cant complete raid in normal mod with a whole newbie players. so it's why i asking an easier mod.
---
also, i respect to traning guilds and their leaders to try teach. i mean like the people of this reddit thread. u just refuse anything which helps to newbies.
---
its interesting, you are against for an lfr system with no reason. you just keep say "join traning guild" thats all.
---
its not the solution sir. and its not an answer at all. lfr system is helpful and its why i always support the idea of this. thats all \^\^
---
if anet would do this i would be happy. its just a wish.
---
Big caveat on the exotic temple armor from orr; you cannot salvage upgrades from it later - so beware of that when considering changing the runes on it
---
I dare to say, it's easier to recognize skilled Guardian from unskilled Guardian, than skilled Warrior from unskilled Warrior.
---
People aren’t rejecting your changes because we don’t want changes, it’s because they’re absolutely awful.
---
Actually, it is.
---
yea it's almost as if these categories are wrong and the classes can't be divided this way
---
you basically made some insane assumptions than tried to adjust your arguments to fit them
---
Honestly the only way to balance mesmer would be a complete rework.

There was a celestial "Heal" scourge build on metabattle.com, but I don't know how viable it is atm. And iirc there were celestial Elementalist builds around too 
---
I don't think you played wow if you think GW2 is that similar.
---
They lied. Manifesto video was full of lies to get people hyped and to get more attention, potential players. That being said, some people are completely happy about this game and  everything about it, and most of them never played Gw1, and this is not the sequel of GW1. The moment someone releases MMO with GW1 mechanics, I’ll quit this game and never look back.
---
Something about pineapples and yoyos.
---
Actually since release of GW2, it was WoW, who was copying a lot.
---
Gw1 PvP was absolutely dead because of the rank system and needing to organise groups before entering.
---
Super supportive of the snow crows link. With RiT and RA in NA I’ cleared everything except dhuum and the last two bosses of W6. One you get some experience with them, the pug life is much easier in lfg.

Unpopular opinion, but boob plates  aren't a problem... And here is why: [Boob Plates by Shad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KHz0qWQA9I&amp;t=1s).

The much bigger problem on female heavy gw2 armor (and male too btw) are the [spikes](http://argos-soft.net/GW2/ArmorGallery/index.php?color=10&amp;sex=0&amp;race=2&amp;w=3&amp;skinID=orri&amp;lang=en) everywhere. (And otherwise masively oversized shoulder pads...

They actually are. They're even called rodents on more than one occasion. ;)
---
Felines do actually get engorged breasts, but not nearly as prominently as humans.  A's at most (relative to size), and only while nursing and having not been drained recently (like just prior to birthing, or briefly after weaning).
---
Who's not to say charr couldn't have evolved to include breasts, besides massive muscular chests and a natural predisposition to running on all fours?
---
Well, yeah it is. So he wanted to ask, why ANet should implement an EXTRA system for dungeons, like the "automated" group finder you have in games like WoW, which is basically the same, except you don't chose your group, but get put together with 4 other guys looking for the same Dungeon, without the chance to even interact while the group isn't full. 
---
I needed some core Tyria exp for my alt account to unlock Mentor tag, so I did T1 fractals. Fractals with no instabilities? So fun! It wasn't a steam roll because well, it's T1 where players still don't have much exp or min/maxed equips. Though to be fair, neither did my toon (Scholars expensive yo!)
---
Then I logged into my main account, saw the instabilities for T4 and wondered why am I subjecting that to myself? Needed griffon money for my alt so I still did it. The T4 still went by smoothly but I had so much more fun in T1, despite non meta equips and inexp people. 
---
&gt; but with the upcoming QoL-changes to Chrono's boon-application I figured this might be a good time. 
---
Wouldn't that make it a bad time to do it now, or rather, better to compile now, wait for update, see how that changes things to make appropriate changes to skip list, then publish?

One more reason why I wish the scourge portal worked like mesmer portal...

---
&gt;I played GW1, and the biggest issue I'll take with your statement is calling GW1 an MMO. It's not. It's an online RPG, but there's no 'Massively Multiplayer' aspect to it at all.
---
I believe the official term for GW1 was "Cooperative Online RPG" or CORPG.
---
Superior Rune of the Eagle is actually really good, it gives the same great stat gain as Scholar. For open world content only, you could easily benefit from them in any power build other than Reaper maybe. For organized instanced content, after the next patch they will still be great on Warrior, Soulbeast (running Beastmastery and not Skirmishing), Weaver (won't even need Spotter with them), and to some extent power Chrono.
---
Superior Rune of the Flame Legion is actually pretty good and potentially even better than Scholar on power classes that do a lot of burning, like Weaver or possibly Holo.
---
Also, one little trick if you are really really poor but need gear as a stepping stone to earn some more gold would be buying level 78 berserker's exotics. I really don't recommend sticking to those for long, but if you just want to gear say a warrior or dragonhunter to farm straight away for ascended, you are just giving up a few stat points per piece (which do add up but you're still very close to level 80 exotics) but are only paying something like a third or a fourth of the level 80 equivalent. A warrior could get almost a full set of gear with under six gold that way, saving at least 17 gold.

I am not sure. I am convinced that they don't have hair, and all wear bad wigs for social reasons. They don't have any sexual secondary characteristics.

"But only comment if you agree with me" right at the end amazing
---
No one uses it because people aren't running dungeons
---
And what should matchmaking use to match people.
---
how many people a party is looking for, level, build, hours played, class type.. match making works sorta in pvp because its a simple system for it to track, check and match.
---
 Open world dungeon party creations won't work at all.
---
That is what's lfg is for.. someone wants to do a dungeon, they open a lfg and wait and if anyone wants in, joins.. simple.
---
back when dungeons where.. something, it was busy.
---
it's barely used because dungeons have been run down soo much people arent interested... Thats Anets fault.
---
Good luck. They often abandon anything slightly old, Dungeons are ancient in A.net terms and probably long forgotten.
---
You want to participate ? :)
---
Not true for all dungeons and who wants to wait 10 min for a 5 min dungeon??
---
MOBA genre easily has role matchmaking, mmr (hours played/skill level).
---
Why can’t dungeon have the track, check or match thing too? You pre-select your role, and wait for a group to match.
---
Dungeons are not only uninteresting but they are so hard to get into.
---
A new player wants to join, no groups in lfg, never touch dungeon again.
---
Vs
---
A new player pre-select his role, dps or support and wait for a team. So much simpler, so much easier to get into.
---
If pvp is lfg too, there wouldn’t be as much players playing it.
---
Now unless I’m misunderstanding the op’s post, dungeons already have all but the extra rewards for using the lfg

Think Holo, DH and power Weaver can use flame legion runes also. Slight DPS loss when I tested it but worth it if you can't get scholar.

Ever tried looking up at the Airship at the temple of Grenth in vanilla cursed shore(the one on the approach where you have to defend the npc on the way) you should. its so dam cute.

Well that follows on nicely to what I discussed further.
---
Chances are Asura don't use breasts to attract a mate, and they only swell while nursing offspring.
---
&gt;the smarter a species is, the bigger their brains are compared to the total body mass.
---
This is actually nonsense. It's due to brain composition, not overall mass in relation to body size. This is neatly demonstrated by Human evolution.
---
Now Asura do have big bobble heads, but we don't know how their pelvises are structured, nor their birth canal, so it's pure speculation that they have the same issues as humans.
---
Well, you still don't get a group of noone uses this tool ANet had to implement first.
---
Next problem : by which standard would determine the roles needed and chose one of those /check if a player really fits this slot? We have no hard trinity, no pre-categorized specs and most of all no fixed need of role x/y/z in Dungeons like in e.g. WoW. And even there players abused the checking criterias to get a slot they did not fit into (at least when I still played it..)
---
And the LFG works just fine, as long as at least one player has the balls to take initiative, then the group fills in almost no time espacially during peak hours.

maybe we have different ideas of what a "ez mode" would look like. I envision it as a mode you have to work to fail at. Meaning players can do in what what ever open world build and like 2dps, fail repeatedly at mechanics and clear just fine. For that kind of playing experience the rewards imo should be very low as the bar to clear it is also exceptionally low. 
---
You want that ascended gear? good drops on every boss kill? those raid only skins? etc etc you gotta leave the ez mode or training mode or w/e behind. Imo if you can get everything by playing the "ez mode" whats the incentive for those players to ever improve their play, and move beyond their comfort zone.

DM "Hashel" (me) so we can talk about the project :)
---
Just because something is fine doesn’t mean it cannot be improved.
---
And you are contradicting yourself then. Without the trinity, we are perfect for matchmaking. We don’t have to worry about people abusing the role system. We don’t even have to worry about level system because the dungeon scales.
---
It and future patches are likely to be excellent in my opinion. There will be mistakes, but I believe with fewer Devs, they’ll be opening themselves up to more feedback from experts at each class. Many top tier players are multi classers who understand what does and doesn’t need changing. 
---
What nerf is warrior getting in pvp?
---
These instabs were easy with a Heal Renegade. Ventari projectile block has such good uptime that Bleed fire is an non-issue.
---
Birds, while annoying, the damage becomes negligible so people only really have to dodge to get red of the blinds.
---
We also had a quickbrand so plenty of stability and didn't have to worry about being knocked around
---
I actually thought this was funny.
---
It's a self-perpetuating meme at this point. People won't learn, or stop bitching.
---
Follow a video guide if you want less confusion, guide numbers are off because Anet only introduced the numbering system later. There are guides to which number is which coin somewhere..
---
I'm probably late to answer this;
---
I'm veteran WoW player of 10 years (playing on and off ofc), but started playing GW2 last summer to see what good could be in this game.
---
In honest opinion if you want to PvP (battlegrounds and arenas in WoW and WvW (World vs World) in GW2), I'd pick GW2 instead of WoW, but for PvE (raiding and dungeons) I really recommend WoW just because I enjoy it more than GW2.
---
If you plan to play casually but don't want to much PvP or PvE, I recommend GW2 very much.
---
mate,there isnt anything to nerf on warrior,since CORE IS TRASH,BERSERKER WAS NERFED TO THE GROUND AND FULL COUNTER HITTING FOR 1K IN FULL ZERK GEAR AND ITS  1 SEC BLOCK AS PROFESION ABILITY OF PVP SPEC. last thing is to nerf is rampage since  10 ppl are still not able to dodge BOULDER. and to your post,so warrior getting after a HALF YEAR of NO ballance patches 0 QOL on skills,0 ballance on useless skill and traits. again,as someone who left warrior a year ago,bcs there isnt anything new to do with it. balance team is most important part of any mp game,sadly anet dont understand that at all and for them,balance is just a tool to nerf things ppl like.

Yeah a recent patch caused badges you've already found to show up again. Annoying but those badges can be ignored.

Here's a table to find the corresponding badge number in Dufly's guide: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Lost_Badge_Dulfy_translation_table.jpg
---
The real sad part is other classes gets nerfed so warrior gets a spot again. 
---
I just wish getting agony for fractals doesn't cost over 50 gold or 100 hour play time. At least for sub-sequence toon. So I can have 8 build ready to swap instead of one class to do all fractals.
---
I think the sidebar has most of the information you want, but here's my two cents.
---
The expansions go on sale, but honestly I think they're worth their full price. Both expansions have massive single-player campaigns and add an incredible number of features and new aspects to the classes and I don't feel like some of the sale prices properly reflect that. It feels good to get a good deal, but I sometimes wish the expansions were more expensive because the low price devalues the developers' work. There are lists of ANet-approved dealers (don't just get them off random websites) where you will occasionally see them go on sale. They may do that for March and they should certainly do that for the GW2 anniversary sales in August.
---
Choosing the expansion can be tricky, depending on what you want to get out of it. So I'll break them down based on my subjective understanding.
---
Elite specs: PoF. With the exception of HoT's Reaper for necromancer, PoF's elite specs all feel more fun to me. All the elite specs have their place, depending on what you want to do. I'm more into the solid DPS playstyle, though, and PoF tended to do better on that end in most regards. I also feel like PoF's specs were more creative with changing class mechanics (see Reaper just changing shroud skills to melee whereas Scourge eliminates shroud altogether and just gives you F1-5 abilities)
---
Story: Hands down, PoF. HoT's story is incredible in its own right, particularly with interesting audio differences when playing on sylvari characters, but PoF delivers on incredible cinematic story beats like HoT only wishes it could.
---
Maps: HoT by a nose. Dragon's Stand is hated by a lot of people because it's a map that makes you panic and run through before it resets itself, and I get that. Its whole design is anathema to Guild Wars 2's core. With all that said, the final boss is a massive animation spectacle that I wish we got to see more of. Also, while PoF maps have more events and have some meta events like HoT does, HoT clearly spends more time and energy on the meta events and the spectacle of them. These events truly take up the whole map, and PoF can't really manage that, given the size of the maps.
---
Features: Tie. I can't really decide between on-demand gliding to save yourself from fall damage or mounts. Mounts are cool, but there's also something very nice about being able to pop the glider, even if you're in combat, to keep yourself from splatting. I think, as someone who owns both expansions, I've come to really appreciate gliding in a way I hadn't before being exposed to mounts. I think this is a testament to the amazing work the devs did in developing these features to work with each other without feeling like they compete with each other. ANet just does NOT supercede old content with new content, and it's amazing.
---
End of the day, though, don't choose. Get it all.

Good thing it's not Camera Shake.

And if you've been playing for years, you can very well literally just say "man, this content was better last update" and that statement will remain true to the majority of players dating all the way back to 2013. They have been fucking over fractals just about every update honestly.

You assume others dont put enough effort and whats embarassing is that you dont have enough brain to imagine the scenario and how much pof only players are fucked. Keep bandwagoning on "everyone casual lel" narrative. There is big barrier you just dont want to accept it in this scenario.

I wont go in detail why what you suggested does not help in this case because from your comments you seem pretty fuckin dumb and it would be a waste of time.

Oh. Yes! Agreed. I think the biggest culprits are boonbeast and condi ambush mirage. One is being tuned down this patch. I expect the other to be tuned down next patch. We’ll see!

You have paid of it by buying POF/HOT, don´t fall for that marketing trick. it may be cheap AF, but nothing is free. it was also one selling point. "and we will continue with the living story and future updates". 
---
same, without pof/hot you wont have access to them, and again, i may be the minority, but without the future implimitation of raids i wouldn´t have ever thought of buying hot/pof. same goes for wvw/pvp. you buy in on the promise that future content will be added. "if a product is free, you are the product".

Scrapper isn't great for roaming. Thats probably not gonna change after the patch.

Balance patches are way too scarce and they just leave class possibilities dead for years in worst case (engineer medkit) when even a month is enough for people to just rather change to another game. Nowadays WvW is pretty much the only content I play as it's unfortunately still the best mass pvp option available in MMORPGs. It's also getting close to no attention from the developers (just 1 or 2 of them?) so I feel no need to throw money at them.
---
I never really got hooked into the lore either as I started the game a few years ago some of the stories were locked behind pay wall so didn't see myself paying for those so thus I'm not too excited about new living stories either.
---
I'm generally against microtransactions but would see myself paying montly fee (up to 20€) if they would hire a full time class balancer or WvW developer that would also communicate with the players openly.
---
Slippery slope social awkwardness deepstone is just annoying at the boss too
---
I got this game as a gift 2 nights ago so now I'm checking out /r/guildwars2 threads and I have come across this.
---
"We take the attitude of playing games for FUN in almost every other genre, so why can't we do it for MMOs too?"
---
Though you may have already gotten similar or better answers, I just wanted to throw in my 2 cents.
---
The chase for the carrot isn't only in MMOs. It has now come into FPS games and even RTS games. Take Call of Duty games for example, before part 4 there were no levels. I played with many of the same people throughout these call of duty games since part 1. In the 1st and 2nd game you could see them play for many hours almost every night, no progression, just fun. Then in the games that had levels and prestige and unlocks (Part 4-8), you could actually see them grind all the way to the top level only to quit shortly after. I have seen this with many games, not just Call of Duty and not just MMOs. I think it's likely due to the chemical rewards your brain dispenses. When you gain that level/perk/item you get a tiny serotonin or dopamine reward (whatever) and want to keep going. Eventually it may no longer be about playing the game for fun, but to get the reward. Some people need it as fast as possible (item shop xp boosters) or will do whatever it takes to get the reward (grind the same instance 1000 times). And once the reward stops, the "fun" stops.
---
This chase for the chemical fix is why MMOs are so popular, if they successfully give their audience that fix then they will constantly pay 2 play. Other game devs have figured it out, or at least figured out they need to mimic the MMO market, which is why you now see games in almost every genre with unlocks/levels/prestige/item shops.
---
The massive amounts of complaints you see in MMOs is just a symptom of the chemical grind, once the fix stops or doesn't come quick enough, the complaints mount. There are of course legitimate complaints also, but there are also people who just really want their fix to not end or to speed up. Just an opinion on why these types of games generate this exaggerated response.

[Privater runes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Privateer) have a good amount of power, some nice might duration for professions that get lots of might such as warriors, and the parrot actually deals good dmg (specially if you further give it might)---- cost 10 silver each
---
[Centaur runes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Centaur) are similar to privater but instead of power they boost swiftness. I used these on my mesmer while leveling as i found perma swiftness was difficult to achieve (tho now i have mounts) ----costs 5 silver each
---
[Pack runes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Pack) give a large amount of stats, power and precision, and when you join in combat you get a "lesser" version of [call of the wild](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Call_of_the_Wild) ranger warhorn skill that grants you fury, might and swiftness. ----costs 1,06g each
---
you can´t realy compare. while gear progression is as the name suggests somthing you do to make your character more powerfull. regearing you chrono every 3 month "to suck less" is barly comparable. especially on the physolocical side. i have no problem in other games running the same dungeon 100+ times for that one specific item i am missing, but here? farm gold or wipe your credit card.where is the "i don´t tread mmo´s like a second job" crowd on this matter?

That's unique to Draconis Mons, from Living World Season 3.  Explore at your own peril!
---
Support scourge: no... You can't get out of this by dying. I'ma gonna res you until you learn the mechanics
---
Celestial scourge is meta for zerg fights, you make use of all the stats as you do power and condi damage, but the main purpose of cele scourge isn't damage but boon corruption (the main damage dealers are rev and ele), but if you play it right you will still deal relevant amounts of damage. So just stay alive and corrupt as boon boons as possible.

---
sure but its not the people whining its the people who are complacent
---
probably:
---
&gt;Relationships that break up tend to feature more fights about who gets the inventions than who gets the kids.
---
&gt; I found Rune of the Pack much more attractive option for my solo and small group runs. It gives you the same amount of Power, then a tasty lump of Precision, a bit of boon duration extra, and a bit boons each 30 seconds to boot. Looks like a better overall coverage to me.
---
It's a side-effect of build guides, I think. People see the best mathematically and assume it's the only one you have to have. Second-best is still second best.
---
I know both systems, and I'm not seeing a big improvement in this case.
---
Case one :
---
Both systems are available. So those actually wanting to run dungeons with a bunch of randoms have to decide if they want to search on their own conditions, or just hope for the best. Most veterans would stay with the old system to guarantee only 80 almost smooth runs as always, which lowers the player count for the "matchmaking" system, so the newer players sit in it, waiting and waiting till they give up and decide dungeons are dead anyway. Or join a full low level noob group and decide dungeons in GW2 are way to hard.
---
Case two:
---
Only keeping the new system. Players won't be thinned out. Okay. Fine. Unless you put in a criteria tool. We'll without it you get a bunch of veterans complaining, because they get forced to run with players which are actually trying to run the Dungeon on the level it was meant for. They are scaled down too, sure. But their full Ascended, lvl 80, infused equipment with superior runes and Sigills scaled down let them deal twice as much damage even "scaled", not taking in account the missing traits, player experience and elite specializations.
---
So you end up either putting in the option to get a group based on pre-set criteria, which splits most of the vets from new players and have the same result as above. Or you decide not to create this option, but it scares away the vets searching for a smooth ride and.. You have the same result as above.
---
So for the "matchmaking": there is no "matching" as long as you have no criteria and even with such it would most probably not turn out well.
---
What really would help the "Dungeon scene" were a system that favors veterans to teach new players how it's done, but then you are walking the thin line between "good enough reward to take your time and teach them" and "why the heck should anyone get this for babysitting?!". And even if you hit the spot I rather see vets soloing dungeons with their 4 alt accounts standing at the entrance, than actually teaching new players. 
---
That frog better be careful, she's a lich 
---
Snargle would feel alive in WvW, he's a necro. All that life force in there, permeating the air from all the blobs clashing, the camp guards getting smashed, the veteran creatures and dolyaks getting murdered, it's all gotta go somewhere and there's a lot more dying things there than there are necros to soak it all up.
---
second last pick is when PvE'ers enter WvW on mass Morrow 
---
It's just... There are so many videos out there that are exactly like this. No interesting editing, no voice or cam, just a video showing off a few WvW roamers kills with music.
---
I think that a lot of players do actually play for Fun but also for the community aspect provided by the MMO genre. Maybe YOU are the problem and only play with hardcore grinder players in "end-game PvE" guilds that give you the impression that it's the only thing around.  But you could just try to join any casual community oriented guild out there (and there are plenty) and I can assure you that you will find a lot of players that just enjoy sitting or wandering around together in all parts of the game and don't care (or even know) about the end-game and new content. Most of the players in my guilds don't even have all seasons/xpacks let alone up to date with the story.
---
You may just be talking about the noisy top 1%.
---
gear progression =/=  gear choices. having better items =/= having more items.
---
with "to suck less" i meant compensate for balace changes, i did not impliefy that chrono is worse now.
---
not realy, in most other mmos, the best gear is in the hardest content, which lead to already beeing more fun because of the challenge aspect. further you get  "forced" to socialize to get some friends to run said content more efficiently. the same thing happens in gw2 with raids and t4 fraks + cm, but with the "slight" catch that you can only run it once per week/day. while others might enjoy the current gold farms, i find them pretty boring. The game just "rewards" you for just spending time there. And of course you can skip that with whiping a credit card, i  actually CAN get all the BIS gear without leaving LA. other than that it feels much more rewaring to get that ONE drop you need in this "fucking RNG" games, that WORKING your ass of farming maps on brain afk mode for weeks and than feeling burned out after aquiring that item. you even see that the most popular meta are the ones that drop very very very rng based infusions. it seams that people want that.
---
Problem is some of us, myself included,  throw many at the 1st piece of garbage that gets released
---
You know I prob AM in the top 1% for playing PvE, and even I think he's talking out his butthole.
---

---
I have no opinion on the Chrono changes since I'm just a casual noob 😄
---
I can't tell if OP is trolling or not. For some reason he is singling out MMO gamers as the "problem" when its not true. Sure, some MMO gamers might do what he says but its gamers in general. Going out of your way to say its just one type as the problem is asinine and only makes you look like a fool.

I feel you on ranger, I've tried to get into it so many times but it's just very boring to me.
---
I started playing necro a lot more and it's been so much fun. [Minion master](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Reaper_-_Power_Minion_Master) in particular is enjoyable and really easy to pick up. You can basically let your minions do all the work. [Power Dragonhunte](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Dragonhunter_-_Power_DPS)r is also really fun and I don't think it's super complicated for OW (obviously for any raids you'd have to learn the rotation, but that's definitely not needed for OW roaming or stories). 
---
hi
---
What to do with exotics,sell,salvage,mystic forge or sth else that maybe I don't know.
---
Honestly, I hate skips. Killing trash mobs is far more profitablem,fun and legit than just skiping everything.
---
It actually is worth almost nothing. The f2p restrictions get removed if you buy either of the expansions so theres realistically no reason why you should buy it.
---
It's possible to get it stuck on the terrain by exploiting the fact that it will always try to use the leap to close the distance if you're close enough but can't go into midair by leaping, at which point you can solo it if you have a ranged weapon with piercing/AoE/nonprojectile attacks (since it can also spawn watermelons whenever it wants that will absorb regular projectiles).
---
You don't get anything from killing it other than a champ bag, not even an achievement, and it's nowhere near any of the farm locations, so that's probably the only way you'll ever see that champ dead.
---
How is it good for world completion? I don't know a single mob that doesn't die within one or two seconds.. you won't have time to spawn your minions at all 
---
Get gud? I can reliably stay above 90% health ~80% of the time.
---
While this class uses only very few button presses and has a very simple rotation, the positional part makes it actually not that easy to play, if you actually want to max out your potential. You have to be the right distance from the boss in order to hit with Bounding Dodger and you have to make sure you're not landing in a disadvantagous position. Playing it at a boss like Qadim requires very accurate positioning to not fall down or end up inside his PBAoE, Matthias loves to move in a quite unforeseeable pattern, and the animation lock from Weakening Charge can be deadly.
---
God forbid people with different opinions 
---
If you consider the amount of time you save by doing proper skips; not only is this more profitable, it's also the fun in doing proper runs and is as legit as afk autoattacking mobs down for 30s.
---
The matter is not the differences. The matter is the way they disagree. In my humble opinion.
---
I think the story dungeons with Destinys Edge need to be rolled into the personal story and soloable by even noobs.
---
The explorable should be a five man lethal dungeon crawl like 2ed D&amp;D.
---
you can also get one of those in your guild hall if you buy the decorations in Draconis Mons
---
&gt; What will happen in 5-10 years?

That really depends on your circumstances, I think. For me *right now* the Unbound tools help the most, since I am working on the Aurora collections.
---
I play Weaver a lot and run raids weekly &amp; Fractals daily.  
---
I never die in raids because proper placement &amp; knowledge of mechanics allows you to avoid any damage.  
---
In Fractals, with the birds instability &amp; the HP reduction like we had this weekend, you literally have 8k HP and birds probably take down 80% of that, so that leaves you with 2k HP. I'll accept that I'm not the best player out there, but anyone would die in this situation. That's why I prefer playing scourge, easily twice the HP, barriers, better self healing &amp; ranged.  
---
The medium armor low difficulty duo: SB^3 and Staff Daredevil.
---
&gt;And you think these additional teams work for free?
---
Of course not. Never said they would, so you should avoid puting words in my mouth and then ramble about it for 10 paragraphs. 
---
Handling several platforms is an increased maintenance cost, obviously. 
---
At this point in time supporting another platform is a gamble, that is how buisness work. They do an investment according to several market studies, resulting in if they can increase their profit or not. 
---
Back to the original debate, they don't need twice the workforce to handle several platforms, the current content creation team wouldn't have to be increased.

Glyph of Bounty(=33%for xtrastrike) in sickle

(home instance=Glyph of bounty does not work on strike-limited nodes like rich nodes+home instance nodes+Guild hall+ and on Orrian Oysters). Use bonus-drop glyphs or Industry instead), (With rich metal nodes, use (Glyph of Prospector=Grants a 33% chance to receive bonus ores while gathering in addition to your gathering results. Material types are determined by your character level and location in the world.)), 
---
Glyph of Leather in axe

It is reset on your weapon abilities. After using your normal 1-5 ability, u can use rampage to get new 5 abilites that are usually more powerfull than basic abilites. Thats why I call it ability reset. Holo can get also ele elite that isnt as powerfull. The consistency of rampage is pretty important. Rampage is like third weapon with bigger cooldown on swap. Warrior hits like a truck but he doesnt bring any utlity and he isnt good teamfighter. 
---
Im not telling that dodging a boulder or jump is hard but that you underestimate the power of getting new 5 more powerfull abilites with defensive boost. 
---
One.... two... five! -"Three sire!" - Three! *throws*
---
I would suggest you start at lvl 80 and follow the "My Story" line and complete that. You could do the same with your lvl 30 though. Either way it will get you started and give structure to your play time and help you learn your character. In LFG under the open world tab you can join hero point trains that will guide you in obtaining the hero points you need to train your class's elite specs. Also in the same tab you can find "world events" like Dragon Stand there you can work with other players to complete the event.  Don't rule out joining a guild as they can be invaluable to a new player who has lots of questions and needs guidance. Good luck and have fun!

I love healer the only class i really enjoy inmmos.

I've had some issues doing LS2 stories this week, where I consistently dc'd finishing a story. Though I noticed it happened more if I opened bags before completing a story entirely.

Dulfy guide is really really bad for this specific achievement. The guide is not in sync with the achievement, meaning if you find badge #17 in the guide it actually turns out that it is badge #28. She has never updated the guide at all. 
---
Frankly, OP is better off downloading Taco and follow the path to all the golden lost badge. 
---
When the achievement first came out, there was no in-game checklist, so Dulfy's numbers were the only ones that existed.... plus, doing them in the order ANet lists them in would be incredibly painful.
---
You can compare numbers here for both SW and Drytop - https://imgur.com/bE8gzLt    https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd5a14653b83d0ad7d29acdb2634a8164c871a044d5c2e6c3bab8bc56961f4b4.png
---
I got that in Doric's Lake once, it was really fun to fly around on my raptor :D I could float forward almost indefinitely, but when I landed the mount got all the damage for the traveled distance, so got killed after each long glide xd (Btw it persisted even after waypointing within the map.)
---
But yet there's also:
---
&gt; Asura have a strong sense of family and extended family, they affectionately refer to their children as "progeny" or "offspring". They also venerate their parents, and grandparents.
---
Which sounds to me like they love their kids enough to not argue over who gets them, and would both still take care of them regardless of divorce/breakup.
---
I stopped playing GW2 before season 1 officially hit, came back about a month before PoF released.  I feel your pain.
---
My advice: Make a new character just to get re-accustomed to the game mechanics.  You can always hop back to your 80 once you feel less overwhelmed.
---
Thanks :D
---
&gt; Should I roll a new character or pick up my ranger? can I reroll my old character if I messed them up?
---
You should start a new character but don't delete the old ones. They get Birthday presents every year with nice things in it.
---
Sure you can reroll your character but if you delete a character you will lose any progress with them which also includes the Age, which means you start at 0 days again towards birthday presents. I wouldn't know why you want to reroll though because your look can be changed through a makeover kit and your skills can be switched on the fly.
---
&gt; Should I just play a max level character to get into the current game right away?
---
You could try but I strongly would advise against doing this. GW2 relies heavily on you knowing how the game works on level 80 and jumping right to that will overload you with things you learn step by step through levelling.
---
As you said yourself, your knowledge of the game is lacking and that you are overwhelmed so why even try to drive 24 hours of le mans if you can make your driver's license first?!
---
&gt; Are bots a problem still?
---
Never really think they were a problem, ever. You will see them, if ever, somewhere running around but GW2 does a good job on keeping them outside.
---
Can anybody tell me what scarf this is please? I need to have it now xD
---
We had a Tempest and a support Scrapper work with us to clear this. Both would use their ranged res the downed and cleanse the conditions/reduce damage while everyone else DPS/cleaved stuff down. One of my friends reportedly used a Renegade Healer for this in his group.
---
Its a rough set of instabilities for sure, but adapting to it was an interesting challenge.
---
I personally wouldn't even mind that, a really good middle of the road approach would be to have a Silverwastes style map that opens up a little more with every patch.
---
Great. Thanks \^\^
---
This is exactly how I picture everyone tomorrow.
---
Does a TacO marker pack exists with these awesome skips?

If not, it might be a great idea to create one!

Good example are beam attacks (mesmer GS1, elementalist scepter air1, druid staff1...), instant AoE attacks (elementalist staff fire2... a lot of them), specific nonprojectile targeted attacks (elementalist staff fire3, necromancer axe1, axe2...). There is a lot of those. Each class have access to those.

---
Depends on what you consider "no wiki":
---
1) No wiki in the sense that there is one but its obscure (under a different name, on a less populated site, limited access, etc) would be harder to play but somewhat manageable until you stumble across it by chance.
---
2) No wiki in the sense that there is a wiki but its multiple of them and they all have piss-poor information, hard to make sense of whatever information they have on them, or other wikis contradict each other and lack some resemblance of uniformity, then you might as well continue playing blind.
---
((A good example for both the above points would be some of the Maplestory resource sites, which include but aren't limited to a Wiki, a Wikia, Basilmarket, Hidden-Street, and some other fanbased resource sites))
---
3) No wiki in the sense that none exists whatsoever would eventually fall under points 1 or 2 over time, but there will eventually be a wiki created but the quality would drop off or access to that information would drop off.
---
Something to note though is that the GW2 wiki is a special case where the wiki site is somewhat tied to the game via actual development/developer interaction (though our wiki has an in-game way to access it but the pages themselves are community driven/curated/edited). A site similar in structure to the GW2 Wiki (though somewhat more limited on what the community can do to those pages) would be something like the FFXIV Lodestation if I had to say.
---
Raids suck to learn but once you've got a group that's got an encounter down you can mechanically reproduce that success until a balance patch changes something.  Fractals, not so much.
---
wouldn't hold my breath on it
---
Enjoy it whenever it happens.  Probably the most fun glitch in the game.  I hope one day we get a full low-grav map.
---
I think my static disbanded.  Really due to unrelated issues, but it started cracking up with the new instabilities.  First it was Shattered as a Rec, as nobody felt like waiting for dialogue gates, then it was Fragile + any other damage increasing instability, and now - for me, anyway - it's "I've gotten everything I need out of this content and it's not enjoyable in its present form."
---
Oh, so the racing scarf then right? nice\~
---
Yup.  In low-level zones (basically anything in core maps) you cast your minions when the map loads.  They even persist underwater once you have the skills set in the same slots.  It's the ultimate in low-effort gameplay, as it can clear champion spawns with relative ease and there's almost nothing in the core game that can stand up to it.

that's one salty cake

Then did he raise on high the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, saying, "Bless this, O Lord, that with it thou mayst blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy."
---
Can't be WvW edition: there are too few red dots xD
---
It most certainly is! Having them around completely trivializes the jumping puzzle I made in my guild hall but it's a noble sacrifice to be able to spiderman around the guild hall
---
Maybe a WvW lobby with crafting stations and other services
---
If you look at the npcs in Lake Doric that have spears, those animations could already be used for any two-handed combat weapon really, and since they already have spears in the game, I'd much rather have them use those instead of the idea of a two-handed axe.  
---
Melee staffs these days already seem dangerously close to spears. So would they even consider it even making spears, which they already have some animations for?  
---
aside from that, I'd appreciate a proper melee dps hammer for the current heavies rather than a battle axe.
---
Looks like the next LW map is going to be a Battle Royale
---
A hub for all servers of that region, even. Do it Anet.

New content WvW !! Cautiously hyped. Seems like a small area though.

One answer of that\_shaman's post: [Armistice Bastion](https://twitter.com/Joe_Bumgarner76/status/1102501665209548800) could be the name.

I wondering if I can free some buttons by using voice control (not combat related though, stuff like inventory or mounts).

Crafting and making things in the mystic forge. No chance you can remeber all the recipes. 
---
There was a livestream last Friday. Go watch that on the GW2 youtube channel.
---
The only downside would be the relatively low combat mobility i'd say. Outside of combat there's mounts in like 98% of the open world and those negate any speed disadvantages.

Really a good idea to use a vocal command :) Gz

Anytime I see someone just type /wiki in chat it just looks like they either don't know or are a bit of a dick. If you don't want to help don't answer at all or be more constructive with something like "it's xyz but there's a full explanation on the wiki if you need more info"
---
Yeah I figured that, I was just worried about the fact that no password at all worked like if the account was locked, but seems it may be a normal issue
---
I see Im not the only one in this situation, I guess ill have to be patient
---
I'd suggest Gusrdian for wvw side of pvp... it's been the most stable class through all the  balance changes. 
---
Modifier-heavy low amount of keys setup it is for me. Left hand on Razer Nostromo, with Shift, Ctrl and Alt bound to buttons i can reach without ever putting fingers off WASD, right hand on Razer Naga mouse.
---
Pinky for Shift, thumb on the D-Pad for Ctrl and Alt, and the first six buttons on the Naga make for 24 possible actions ingame. 1-5 for weapon skills, Shift 1-5 for heal, utility and elite, Ctrl 1-5 for class F-skills. Alt 1-6 for the mounts.
---
Well of course you’re going to be full of conditions if 50 people who want to kill you are within range. If condis got nerfed to the ground you’re still going to be stacked with conditions if you’re close enough to be.
---
...and then you have the exalted shoulders (which came after) with out of the worst physics in the game.
---
Yes WvW is still alive. It's all casual now. No competitive raiding like there used to be. Condition builds have are in line with power now except for condi mirage which a lot of people argue is completely broken. The best way to have fun in WvW now is to roam with friends or pug blob surf with friends.
---
Hm... if the name is indeed "Armistice Bastion", it may be a map in which people can't fight each other.
---
So it could by like the Heart of the Mists for WvW, and contain a ViP area, a dueling arena, and maybe a GvG arena too. 
---
How to make gold
---
&gt; What are they doing that I'm not?
---
not playing casually, probably.
---
a wvw lobby so you can let your participation run out without taking up a spot
---
They probably play a lot more/but gold
---
When were bots a problem? Was you not imagining things?
---
Don't delete your Norn, but I'd advise using one of the character slots from PoF or HoT to start a new character and start fresh. You'll have level 80 boosters from the x-pacs as well but I wouldn't use them until you've leveled one character naturally.
---
You can get an upgrade extractor with 3 black lion statuettes. 
---
a gif for the ants
---
They grind a lot; as you could see only 1st half for a precursor is fun in the whole legendary journey, rest is just abysmal mats &amp; gold sink.
---
Ah okay then, [Unbound GLYPH](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_the_Unbound). But seriously, aren't you splitting hairs here, since you don't gather with a glyph, but a tool?
---
TP fiddling.
---
They are not wasting time actually playing the game, and have most of their gold made thanks to bots that tell them when and what to flip, and they intersex themselves in other people's transactions, driving prices up and getting a chunk of the extra cost.
---
Just a sticky to be edited for my answer when I get to the PC.
---
*[Armistice Bastion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice)* sounds more like a neutral lobby than a new borderland.
---
Maybe an old draft of a map to empty your bags/craft/afk to cash in on remaining participation without taking a slot on a borderland, before they changed course and made participation pause upon leaving WvW.
---
The EOTM and OS arenas are fine, though
---
**Armistice**
---
An armistice is a formal agreement of warring parties to stop fighting. It is not necessarily the end of a war, since it may constitute only a cessation of hostilities while an attempt is made to negotiate a lasting peace. It is derived from the Latin arma, meaning "arms" (as in weapons) and -stitium, meaning "a stopping".The United Nations Security Council often imposes, or tries to impose, cease-fire resolutions on parties in modern conflicts. Armistices are always negotiated between the parties themselves and are thus generally seen as more binding than non-mandatory UN cease-fire resolutions in modern international law.

---
Tell me more
---
Yes it is still active especially around prime time most servers have guilds and open raids running around.  
---
We have a pirate ship meta atm which means staying mostly on range and killing the enemy from the distance with coordinated damage.
---
As you can see [here](https://metabattle.com/wiki/WvW) the current meta evolves around Firebrand, Scourge and Herald. Power damage is the main focus, conditions applied are often just applied because of the skills+traits.  
---
For example Scourge Shroud abilities all apply Cripple and Torment even when you go full Power stats.
---
I think a new borderland would likely replace either blue or green, like desert replaced red.
---
team chat GvG confirmed
---
 With the future of WvW and GW2 less certain right now, I put together multiple clips from videos made between early 2013 and mid 2015 before the trait revamp patch and HoT launched.
---
Build played was exotic Berserker with a couple of ascended Celestial jewellery items.  
---
5 Zeal  
---
30 Radiance  
---
30 Valor  
---
0 Honor  
---
Can't fight the guilds in your own server/can't fight guilds of your own color
---
An arena in there would fix the first and that'd be really cool
---
I have been playing casually for 5 years and I have 15 legendaries already.
---
The trick is just not to spend any gold you earn and selling everything you get that you won’t need for crafting legendaries. I really only buy materials in fact..
---
Also I use to sell Gifts of Mastery
---
If you complete your daily rewards and open the daily chest you'll get almost (but not quite) enough resources to craft a Gen1 Legendary. It's been explained in detail but the short version is- in 12 "months" (28 day rotations) you can get:
---
* 420 Laurels (buy T6 mats for legendary)
---
* 84 Mystic Clovers (chest of Legendary Crafting Materials)
---
* 240 Mystic Coins
---
IF you do the dailies:
---
* 672 gold 
---
That's a huge chunk of what you'll need to craft a weapon.  
---
Lets hope its a GvG Arena, but I think it will be a 2000Gem Premium Pass
---
This is typical MMO "balance" patch though. Completely out to lunch on most things. Except I'll give them a thumbs up for tempest buff and gyro rework. Those will be very nice.
---
Someone really should make a flow chart for this daily question so a bot can link it.
---
not nearly as profitable or popular as many people think
---
It's like with Diablo, you also grinding things over and over, there are simply ppl who enjoy it.
---
The waiting lobby for desert borderlands beta?
---
Not playing casually, farming all day, doing fractals every day.. Just making gold consistently I guess?
---
I bet there's a bunch of those in https://itch.io/ with the adult content setting enabled, but Google can tell you way more than me.
---
The Wiki for the game is already a joke, it barely helped me at all as a new player. I love this game but I’ve never seen such a useless wiki. M There’s like 1-2 sentences in each description that for instance if it’s an item it won’t even tell you where to acquire the item. My biggest gripe with this game is the fact that there aren’t better in game resources. Such a joke. 
---
I use a 10$ keyboard and 15$ a4tech mouse I've got like 10 years ago.   
---
Never felt any real need to upgrade either in any of the games I've played. 
---
"It's a really, really pathetic change."
---
I do this but I use 1, 2, 3, 4 and Q for my f1-5 skills (I use Q because I play mostly holosmith and soulbeast and both of those buttons are form changes)
---
Of course it is not popular. If it was, everyone would do it, and it would be even less profitable.
---
But the thing about afk farming and TP fiddling is that they can be done while doing other things, so you get stuff you would otherwise never get while you are doing those other things.  
---
And that always makes them more profitable than the alternative, since the alternative isn't doing something else in the game, but doing nothing at all.  
---
use your playtime efficiently, sell stuff you don‘t need, don't buy materials while everyone else is (during a LS release), plan ahead, check conversion methods, stick to your goal.
---
Based on my luck it is a new borderland, since my graphics card is messed up and I can't play right now! :)
---
&gt;  They have zero vision. They need to incorporate rational players into this again, like they did at the very start of gw2. 
---
Feeling a little aggravated, I feel like design has been a mishmash of no communal vision, design by committee, and being torn by a community with a lot of opinions.  There's like a dart board of who to listen to for maximizing 'fun' but it never hits right and no one is ever satisfied.  
---
From a balance perspective, I'm not sure what would make things even interesting anymore, and all I'm left with is necro power axe percent increase damage memes.  I feel like we're at a point where everyone is used to the status quo, though wanting things to change, but will eventually just reject the change and continue a cycle of unhappiness.  
---
I wonder if we as players hold the game hostage, inching our knives close to the neck of the devs "if we don't get what we want we'll leave you here to die." 
---
Engineer is a jack-of-all-trades but a master of none. That's always the way it's been. You could build an engineer for anything -- tanking, healing, DPS, support, and they would all work.
---
I know, and I don't think my comment gave the impression that I thought they were. The point I was aiming for was more, "that would be cool, but also very unlikely."
---
I would like a lobby if it means my guard never has to exit WvW
---
While I can agree with some of his opinion and concerns, it's obvious he needs a better understanding of some classes if he's going to be putting himself on the spot as someone who feels his opinions are all valid - he should be well aware that he exposes himself to scrutiny when he makes these. It's not just him, but most players, streamers, and content creators are all guilty of this; they all subconsciously exercise biases towards their preferred class(es).
---
An easy example of this: his thief complaints and inability to understand the real problems of the class (not addressed by this patch) says a lot about his understanding of certain classes. He understands the basics, based on what I suppose he heard some thief players telling him...but, the intricacies are obviously not in his understanding.
---
Thief will continue to be in a trash tier spot in PvP after this patch, assuming the notes posted is the full balance patch. The class literally relies on the other 4 players in your team playing properly to be remotely effective. It is not the thief carrying the team, but the team carrying the thief at that point.
---
This pathetic attempt to try validate P/D (with the noted changes) will have a net result of NOT being a thing. Repeater is a 5 initiative (SLOW) skill. A 4 initiative (melee) skill that flips over to a 5 initiative (ranged) skill, which btw does not flip back after 1st usage (like flanking strike) - it persists for the duration of the "buff". It works exactly like Tow Line -&gt; Hooked Spear. For a class that has global resource/cooldown on all its skills (initiative), with limited resetting potential and a traitline being mandatory (Trickery) since the dawn of time, a 9 initiative chain that reduces its kiting ability is absurd.
---
Even with P/D having a great kiting potential, with the ability to instantly put range between you and a melee spec constantly (a defensive mechanism), it was useless before...and now, they expect the spec to fare better by nerfing that kiting potential - which is absolutely idiotic. The spec will also fail in end-game PvE, because both its condi and power potential is insignificant compared to what other specs can deliver. At best, it will be a meme used for entertainment and "fun" purposes.
---
Oh god I can finally move out of PvE fully. Finally!
---
Buying legendaries or legendary crafting expenses with real money is an option. It's very expensive per legendary but whales DO exist. I don't personally agree with the ability to do this, I would rather legendaries were 100% earnable with no possible credit card swipe shortcut, but such is reality. Don't take it too personally if other people are loaded on legendaries, just be proud of the ones you managed to earn.
---
It was changed in the Nov 13th 2018 patch, and it was in the patch notes, fwiw. 
---
1,2,3,4,5 is reserved for mirage shatter skills and elementalist attunement (probably what you meant?)
---
I use the Logitech G600 mouse with 15 extra buttons and up to 40 usable key bindings, which could be tripled, since it has 3 profiles which can be switched via hotkey. 
---
Aside from WASD and Space I can control literally everything with my mouse. Skill 1-9, F1-5, dodge, special action key, inventory, TP, autorun, friendlist, even F11 for settings. 
---
However, for the most fights I use skill 1-5, moving and jumping on my keyboard, for everything else I use my mouse. 
---
I agree and I will never understand why people undermine additions by saying "this is fine, though"
---
WoW is what fucked the MMO genre. Everything on rails and too many folks expecting other MMOs to be like that.
---
And the very worst of all: game development companies (most especially the upper management) brainlocking on thinking they had to make another WoW. It fucked up any real creativity, variety, and diversity in the genre decades ago and the whole genre has suffered for it ever since.
---
Getting OOC to mount is about as annoying as it is with a non-Soulbeast Ranger.  The big difference is a Ranger can swap or stow their pet - or set them to passive so they don't wander off and get into fights - whereas a minionmancer has no such control.
---
It's called Yolomouse.
---
*Wooo* It's your **4th Cakeday** jenniferberry! ^(hug)
---
It would be a hell. How we gonna know what trash we can delete ? 
---
We have to admit, the /wiki "shift-right click" is one of the best thing on guild wars. It is indeed a diferencial.
---
Ingredients:. Salt, salt, salt, salt, baked beans and salt.
---
Have the G600 too, best mouse ever. 
---
To me it looks like "Avalanche Basin"
---
You can exchange money for goods and services.
---
Ranger is a great class for a new player. Your pet often takes aggro!
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
I think the moment in this games life at which players can fuck it up by voicing opinions is long over, to be perfectly honest.
---
I feel like we just need a direct statement from the devs how classes are supposed to be played and feel, and then we can go from there.
---
But... I got you. I know what you mean. Not sure if we can argue about it, because communicating with the balance team is like screaming into a cave and maybe you hear a echo in 3 months.
---
I wonder if devs are now like: "Shit they found it..."
---
Thanks for the comment. I don’t often see videos like this, but I respect your opinion and can try to spice the editing up. What would you call interesting editing?
---
Doesnt sound that bad at all. Guess I'm downloading gw2 again! :)
---
Wiiiiiiiillllll do! Thanks!
---
You don't need to let participation run out anymore.  It only decays when you're in WvW, so you can just log out and the next time you play you're still at tier 6 (or wherever you were last time you played).
---
F2 tome skills are probably the biggest heal you have for burst healing, keeping up regen with mace 2 and detonating shield 5 are for smaller heals. At the end of the day, you're there to heal the unavoidable damage, often it's party members not knowing how to dodge or stand in bad that makes supports not able to keep up.
---
I wonder what people would say if they went back and fixed all the skips, map exploits, path merges, and buffed all the mobs. Instead of 5 minute runs for the easy path you would get 10-30 minute runs.
---
Only semi-related, but does anyone else remember at the end of one of the pre-release betas when they had a legendary rabbit world boss spawn? I think it was on the Issormir platform in the Wayfairer Foothills.
---
The early pro-GvG people were so obnoxious that it caused a lot of blow back against them.  Even now I reflexively  roll my eyes when somebody brings up stuff like this, even though I know that it's not a bad idea.
---
Empower (Staff 4) also offers some decent heal, but the healing mainly comes from mace AA chain, mace 2, and the mantras. 
---
What utility skills are you using?
---
I take heal mantra, regen/cleanse mantra, quickness mantra, situational filler (usually bane signet or stand your ground), and elite mantra.
---
Resolve tome is your emergency burst heal. 
---
Search function works great, but I'll link to a [prior response of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ac4s0o/glyph_of_bounty_or_glyph_of_prospector/ed5egv1/), that refers to still more times that it was asked. Includes some calculation tools if you really want to drill down.
---
&gt;This question comes up a lot, I'll link to some of my prior comments and the spreadsheet that can help you determine what is best for your specific case. It depends a lot on what your gathering habits are, especially the tier that you gather at the split of rich/regular nodes.
---
Overview: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9fjlc0/most_profitable_glyph/e5xrwle/
---
How to work the spreadsheet (I can't api, so copy paste it is):
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9f7wlb/glyph_of_herbalist_and_choya_mining_tool_info_and/e5wh4bx/
---
I should really update it for prospector and forester (Done, new links have forester and prospector), but safe to say that leather exceeds wood and ore at all levels (except maybe t3 depending on how prices move) so it is still the best. Beyond that, you need to do some deciding. Buying a glyph for profit isn't really the best proposition unless you do A LOT of gathering, especially mid-tiers. For example, prospector is about 100 gold. Best use case in a pick is on iron-tier, which will give you about 60c worth of extra iron on every strike compared to no glyph. To recoup the cost of the glyph you would need to hit about 16.7k iron nodes.
---
I find glyphs are a great fit when you want the QoL of an infinite tool anyways and want a bit better payback vs. a particular skin. The other case is if you are a "live off the land" type (like me) where you'd rather go out and get stuff yourself instead of buying off TP. Or if you are a dedicated gatherer - glyphed gathering can get you competitive gold/hr that is always "up", easy to do in small chunks, and doesn't grind your game down to a slideshow like a zerg farm. But in the end, you need to decide what best fits your gathering habits and gold budget for the glyph.
---
Sorry there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer.
---
The obscure collection hints would just drive me away from completing any collections.
---
AS someone mentioned, some Diviner gear will assist with the damages.
---
As for the Healing, I don't know what spec you're using, but this is my go-to for raids and general Blobs in PvE.
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNApeWnsADlBh9CBGBDEEhF+BLrJkh+BYBgZQRYPj2RPpA-e
---
This is very changeable as the fight requires. I will swap out the Heal Mantra for the Heal Shout is more upfront healing is needed. I will change the Elite to the Signet if Quickness is covered. Same with the Quickness Mantra--I will change out for condi cleanse mantra if needed.
---
"Rotation" is more a matter of using as needed/on cooldown. Mace 2 traited is a bigger area, provides 2 forms of healing from regen and trait healing, mace auto heals are still potent and with haste you hit often enough that 600-800 HP ever 2 seconds from swinging is more than you think. Mace 3 to grant Aegis to allies and then heal them when Aegis pops.
---
Swap to staff for burst healing with Staff 3--&gt;2 combo followed by fully channeled Staff 4
---
Utilities I almost always keep is the Bow of Truth as it is some solid healing on a manageable CD.
---
And of course traited as it is, even when you use your Tome 2 for the Oh-Shit moments, you still keep the Resolve passive to keep up heal ticks.
---
Overall, you have a LOT of small heal ticks going all the time adding up very quickly with a lot of options to use for clutch moments.
---
Okay, crazy idea, totally not going to happen but what if it DID?:
---
&gt;**Armistice Bastion**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Armistice Bastion is a new WvW map featuring a battle the Mists have never seen before. The Elder Dragon Kralkatorrik has retreated to the Mists to heal following its encounter with Dragon's Watch. Now it threatens to consume the Borderlands themselves! Given this existential threat, the worlds have put aside their differences... for now. Join your friends and foes in Armistice Bastion to beat back the Elder Dragon. Contribute supplies and complete events in your world's headquarters to prepare for the battle, then join the fray and seek to beat the Crystal Dragon back deeper into the Mists. The world that does the most damage to Kralkatorrik will lay claim to "Might of the Mist Dragon", which provides a boost to stats as well as an increased number of skirmish pips. Maybe your world just wants to focus on overwhelming player damage. Maybe they want to get damage in via massive cannons inside your base. Maybe you want to sabotage the other worlds with weakening fields. The higher-ups only told you that you couldn't kill each other...
---
 I wouldn't put much into that screenshot.  They were playing on test  servers.  That is probably just the same old lobby that was used for gearing up when Anet ran the desert BL beta tests. 
---
Size matters.
---
Bow of Truth basically makes your squad immortal.
---
The healing on aegis proc is pretty significant if I recall correctly. Not to mention the damage mitigation from the blocks. Try to time your aegis-granting skills so that you are blocking several things in succession. Granted, this is fractals we're talking about so, there will be other random shit thrown in the mix. Some of the combos of new instabilities are just brutal..
---
why im even answering to idiot,which dont understand CONCEPT OF RESET OF CD. reset you morron,whoud be if you USED ALL WEAPONS SKILLS THAN USED RAMPAGE FOR HALF SEC,AND THEY WERE ALL OFF CD. my god,why i even bother. all good players already left.
---
If I'm not eating the stacks of levelling books I've gained over the years, I prefer exploration over fighting everything that moves.
---
Exploration gets you a TON of XP, and map completion does as well. Add doing all the hearts in an area, and you're well on your way, with the added benefit of seeing a whole lot more of the game.
---
Do you actually do it exactly like that? (Craft 4 keep 2 sell 2 repeat)
---
I'm asking cuz it sounds fun
---
I don't get it.
---
i contacted them last wednesday about an inconsequential matter, got an answer within 3 hours and the matter resolved the same day :) 
---
I've done every JP in the game, on a Charr. Including the old Lion's Arch ones, back when they were effin' hard.
---
But slag take [Skipping Stones](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skipping_Stones). Never doing that one again.
---
&gt; seize fire
---
Cease?
---
Vergess' dabei nicht, dass MMORPGs sich bei FPS anders verhalten als zB ein Shooter. Wo bei diesen ein Unterschied von 30-200 FPS tötlich sein kann, ist das bei einem MMO nicht unbedingt so gegeben. 
---
Größere Schwankungen der Leistung wirst du dann eher bei Open World PvP sehen, wenn du also 30-50 Spieler auf einem Haufen auf der Karte hast. Der Beschränkende Faktor ist dabei weniger die Verbindung, als die Rechenleistung vom Server auf der einen Seite, und deinem PC auf der anderen. 
---
Im Zweifelsfall kannst du auch ersteinmal das Spiel kostenlos ausprobieren, und einige Zeit schauen, wie sich bei dir die Verbindung so im PvP verhält. :3
---
Bingo.  Those WvW test servers aren't necessarily connected to a running copy of the rest of the game so they need a lobby from which a player can start and queue up a WvW map from.
---
ah true there is that place. I made a jp that led there, dang. welp there's 1 for another video :D
---
Traded beasts for another
---
A combination of rebinding some keys and doing some finger gymnastics! I have extra buttons on my mouse but I just prefer having all of my abilities on my keyboard.
---
You can't outheal stupidity
---
good idea!
---
So...a more PvE-ish WvW map?
---
Let's become a.. FLYING ROLLER BEETLE 
---
I just think it's silly to be making suggestions on balance (which it seems that is what this post is attempting to alter) when we have yet to actually see how things play. All of these changes may be completely unnecessary.
---
Granted, I don't believe the mount will stay as is for very long, and will indeed need to be altered. And I don't completely disagree with some of your suggestions. But the point is that until the mount is in hand, and has gone through some "user testing" so to speak, we have no baseline to be making changes to.
---
There’s a small workaround; block them then double click their name in your block list (should open a whisper with them) then unblock them and you can message them.
---
The groups I've seen trial Diviner Revs didn't find much success with them. Boon uptime is already where it needs to be from the normal facet pulses. The extra boon duration doesn't particularly do a lot of work, especially in a heavy corruption meta. Also consider that the damage drop from Zerk to Marauder is about 10%. Diviner ends up doing even less than Marauder while being glassier because it doesn't have Precision as a major stat or Vitality as a minor.
---
Your best bet is either Zerk or Marauder depending on how comfortable you are with your positioning and your group's ability to provide support.
---
I just got 3 of my friends into this game and this is how I guided them and it seemed to have worked : 
---
I had them start low level just to learn the ropes, story instances, map completion etc..
---
Did that for a few weeks. 
---
Once they were comfortable with the basics and how different builds for their class might work. I had them make a new character.
---
Then I had them use their level 80 booster.  They weren't ready to spend it either, but what people don't realize is, is the level 80 booster has a free trial mode built in.  It let's you try any class you want in the silverwastes at level 80 with everything unlocked without having to actually spend the token.  We went over all the different classes and examples of popular builds for hours  until they found a class that resonated with them most.  2 of my friends then spent their token right away so they could join me right away in tougher areas, the third decided not to and level up naturally.  No wrong answer there. 
---
I thought this was important though, because figuring out your favorite class(es) early on is pretty crucial to enjoying the rest of the game. 
---
Is there a way to get more info in the damage taken pop-up once you die in PvP? Like can you actually see what each skill does by hovering over or clicking something? I don't know how to "git gud" when all I can see is a skill name and icon and that I took 8k damage in 1 hit.
---
&gt; Starting from tomorrow, you'll get double experience in WvW for a week, and using that is not the worst of ideas.
---
that's still WXP. sure, you get tomes quicker, but that's about it.
---
Yes, after the first one that was my pattern until i got like 10k gold, then i crafted 5 and sold all 5. This was over a long period of time, mind you.
---
You went too far friend.
---
Draconis Mons mastery. Sadly only used there and guild hall decoration.
---
Guys, hey, [it's just a gun](https://i.imgur.com/2YV1bvv.gif).
---
Probably better give it to the charr too
---
&gt;a two second stun at the cost of a few autohits or a ridiculously low CC does not make people more vulnerable if they have to waste one of their rare stunbreaks before the ambusher even used any significant CDs? that evaluation does not seem to add up quite right. add that static field (your proposed sufficient CC), and ele/guardian walls are undodgable, and suddenly a single character would be able to dismount an entire zerg.
---
Adds up just fine.
---
If I play an ele and I catch a zerg in open field with a static field, up to 15 of them gets stunned and have to stunbreak.
---
If I play an ele and I catch a **mounted** zerg in open field with a static field, up to 15 of them gets stunned and have to stunbreak.
---
The result is exactly the same. Do you somehow think that the mount deserves the right to just ignore fundamental aspects of the game?
---
And no, you won't get dismounted with "a few auto attacks". The Dev on stream got hit by a full backstab combo, a pretty costly move in terms of resources 
---
 Many thanks for the guidance! Thanks for taking the time to read and reply. 
---
Armistice Ba...TTLE ROYALE! it's finally coming to gw2 too! 😂

Toodles!

Correct, as this was the finale.

Maybe my post has come true.

Well I suppose so. It would be nice to have some fluffy books on each species anatomy. They could be really creative.
---
If only anet would produce some *actual lore content* like we've been asking for since the beta. The recent books have been nice, but it's like using a single butterfly suture to attach a severed limb.
---
There's a serious lack of depth to the flavour in GW2 unless you played GW1 and spin wild headcanons. It's tasty, but it's like a milky bar when it could be a nice dark Ecuadorian 80% cocoa solids experience. It would be a concept artists dream to just do some anatomy diagrams make them look like a book page, slap them into an in game book with some of the conland text up the sides, with translations up one side.
---
I still want to see a depiction of a Norn Skull. I'd expect to see a residual saggital crest, and a few differences from an ape skull around the jaw and nose, being bear people.
---
Paranthropine skulls look very unlike mdoern humans, so a sketch from an old human book showing the transitory fossils from bearlike to more humanoid would be cool.
---
Is thats how an Anet guy got laid off? Thats horrible :(
---
&gt; it gives some boon duration which is still benefitial-&gt;Less pulsing, more energy for other stuff. 
---
I agree; but this is much less of a factor with the "free pulses" you get from draconic echo. You don't really need a lot of energy to get your pulses. And running boon builds without draconic echo is just questionable. 
---
@OP if you're diviner you should run draconic echo at all times. Going heavy into boon duration without running draconic echo is terrible optimization. 
---
Still better than the "The Commander and ..." posts
---
The Six has abandoned us..
---
 Many thanks  for taking the time to read and reply. 
---
The publishing is just the digital release.

I think you are confusing things.
---
Dafuq. The song is from 2000, the original from 1988. 
---
I always wondered how people messaged me!!
---
Oddly enough I have been playing core rev with a misx of diviner and marauder. Works well for roaming, not optimal for zergs though. 
---
You even deleted one comment. Iam at a loss of words. Then again I find no further gain in keeping this discussion going with someone as uninformed as yourself. 
---
Please no. What wvw does not need is more pve.
---
&gt; normal facet pulses
---
Diviner herald isn't necessary, given rune availability, but diviner renegade can be a huge benefit. Damage loss isn't as big as you'd expect, though you're right it is a bit glassy even with marauder accessories.

---
Most professional writers don't care to offer that sort of depth or detail, it seems. I only see that in fan-fiction or passion projects. Occasionally table top settings.
---
It also doesn't help that most of them simply don't have the foundational knowledge to do that.
---
But yeah. GW2 could benefit a lot from that sort of additional worldbuilding. The little details make a huge difference in terms of how alive, real, and different a world feels.
---
no... it's just wearing what I've been able to afford or been given within the story rewards
---
The [Living World](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World) Seasons are smaller episodic content drops. They're free if you log in while the current episode is active. So if you logged in recently you have Season 4, Episode 5 which is the latest episode. Season 1 is unavailable and is unlikely to ever be available for purchase because they used a different system back then. The only thing from Season 1 in the game is the Southsun Cove map.
---
You can buy and play the rest normally. Though Season 2 is also a bit different. The maps are available in the core game (Dry Top and The Silverwastes) and you can play through it even if you don't own it as long as you're in a party with someone that does, though you'll experience the story from their perspective if you do this. You also won't get story progress or be able to get achievements this way. So buy if you want to play the story on your own and like doing achievements.
---
Season 3 requires HoT and Season 4 requires PoF, but both Seasons are definitely worth buying. Each episode has a new story chapter, map, mastery, achievements, etc.

Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). We have plenty of experienced heroes of different classes there that can guide you to the right direction.

Alternatively please check out this [class guide](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play).
---
What’s your IGN? I’ll be on soon and can help set you up with some max armor/weps. 
---
Yeah there’s your problem. By level 80 you should really have exotic equipment, especially for any of LW content. 
---
For those with tons of mystic stones, it might be a good idea to hold off on it since you can make Mystic Salvage Kits pretty easily. I personally have it, but that's for the sake of convenience. 
---
It's best for salvaging rare items and above, since it gives you a better ecto yield. If you'd rather have symbols and sigils, I recommend using the Runecrafter's instead.
---
You can actually get to the top of the pole using the bunny.
---
Source: I have an alt parked there. 
---
Unbound Magic is ridiculously easy to get with Winterberries ...
---
You could do another lv 1-15 map (Caledon Forest might be the best start imo)
---
Up voting for posterity. Also up is a good pun in this case. 
---
Copper-Fed for blues, Runecrafter's for greens, Mystic Salvage Kit for rares+. If you want convenience of never again caring about salvage kits, then use Silver-Fed over Mystic Salvage Kit.
---
Black Lion Salvage Kits are for exotics that you want to extract upgrades from.
---
Like someone mentioned earlier, you can definitely get back to the instance. Most of them have checkpoints (shows up as purple story points on your map) that you can run to and replay that section of the story. Really for trying for achievements as well. 
---
Risky click of the day.
---
If you had time to get in more than one "OH GOD", the zerg wasn't big enough.  :)
---
My funniest (of the few) WvW moments I had, my friend and I were doing little shit, hitting camps, 2v1 roamers. I turn a corner around a mountain and WHAM mowed over by the zerg train. Insta-down. They didn't even stop to finish me, the Choo-Choo of Damage just kept rolling over until death. It was over so fast, I couldn't even be mad. That, and it felt like karma for picking off the roamers. :P
---
It's easy with mounts but if you wanted to do it the "real way", you need to go to the second floor or DR and there's a small little opening to walk through. 
---
I want to see the uncensored version plz.
---
vm and watchwork were about the same a while ago but I think right now vm is around 150% better than watchwork
---
But I think the Combo is what makes me enjoy movement the most...
---
"Foes with a defiance bar cannot be interrupted except by breaking their bar. Skills, traits, and sigils that have bonus effects upon interrupting foes will activate on foes with defiance bars if an interrupt skill is used during an attack windup. There is a 3-second cooldown between each interrupt to prevent the same effect from activating multiple times during the same attack animation."
---
([from here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Interrupt))
---
So, yes, if properly timed/the boss has boons to be stolen.
---
&gt; For those with tons of mystic stones
---
If only for that reason alone, I regret getting the Silver-fed. I have so many mystic stones and there's almost no sink for them.
---
This would be more PvP than most of WvW and it would be a different kind of PvP than today's Pirate Ship.
---
Guardian is my favorite solo class.  If you have dragonhunter unlocked, it gets even better.
---
Try out one of these builds, and get berserker exotic gear or berserker/valkyrie.  Marauder would be nice too, but Berserker armor is pretty cheap and easy to get.  Search for Devona's armor on the Trading Post.  Flame Legion runes are cheap as well.

The delusion is high. There are no soulbeasts, holos or thieves that can destroy me 1v1. S/Sh holo can stalemate me, yes, SlB can sustain for a while but eventually dies, and condi ambush mirage is a 50/50 fight. 
---
I won't even post my videos because I'm sure you'll just find some more deluded things to say with a few smiley faces mixed in so you can feel better about your extremely ignorant message.
---
Holler if you wise up and want to actually talk balance. 
---
Just use them to mystic forge random weapons I guess, personally I don't have that many and the Silver-fed is a great QoL item for me.
---
Plot twist it really is a giant black erectangle???
---
Now that rune/sigil salvage material prices have normalized a bit, silver-fed is the better deal for salvaging yellows
---
I don't think there's too much of a difference in the long run, but the biggest monkey wrench is that if you run fractals or PoF content a lot you're going to get a lot of greens and yellows with empty slots that make the runeforged pointless.
---
Thanks man, appreciate it :)
---
Without defenses, there are no turrets.  Without turrets, there is no use attacking Teq.  With no zerg, its useless.
---
I solo'd nboats/nhills on a bad map in the last week.  Map failed because of my worst pet peeve in this game.   DEAD PEOPLE at Teq refusing to use wp and run back.  The number of dead piled up until basically there was no more zerg.  After a few minutes of defending turrets that were doing their job but no zerg, it became hopeless.  No amount of chat urging would get the dead to wp.  I am sorry to those that tried, but I left.
---
Thereabouts.  Just be careful not to overcap crit or it'll do much worse.  Rev would barely overcap in full Marauders with no other crit sources, so if you have an accuracy sigil / fight in keeps / get external buffs you'll want to keep it mixed with some Berserker to avoid that.
---
This would be a really good package if they wouldnt increase the price with the 10 useless keys.
---
The idea is that you arrive to max level areas knowing how to survive and at least in all rare gear. This is a case of git gud, not a mismatch on the game. 
---
&gt;Who defines superfluous?
---
Is the detail necessary for the narrative. What's superfluous depends on the creator.
---
For a gardener like GRRM many things aren't superfluous that would be for a tighter style of story. Five pages describing the food is superfluous, but it's still nice to have.
---
&gt;I said passion projects.
---
Morrowind wasn't so much a passion project as a sleep deprived psychedelic fueled miracle that saved Bethesda from bankruptcy. But I do take the point.
---
&gt;Frankly, most experts won't give writers the time of day unless you have money to put up. 
---
Well you don't need an expert, just someone sufficiently familiar, I'm and Archaeologist, so I know enough about how the evolution of humans works to imagine a semi-believable transition series from a Bearlike skull to a Norn looking skull.
---
For example, I'd expect them to have a residual saggital crest on the back of their skulls, thicker lower jaws, a slightly more prognathic face, and a few other details, like thicker bone in certain areas. I'd also expect their pelvis to be a bit different, if we imagine they became Bipedal in a different order to encaphalisation than humans, which is something you'd want the creative directors to decide on.
---
As far as selective pressures I'd just keep the environmental conditions vague and suggest a series of possibilities and say "More study needed" at the end. Which mirrors reality to be honest. There's always multiple theories vying for more data to confirm or deny.
---
I'd accept a handful of gems and an in game title as payment if I had the time on the side.
---
Thanks for sharing this post. Only issue is that for people new to WvW, celestial gear is not the easiest to make/obtain due to charged quartz time gate. It’s also not incredibly useful outside WvW at the moment. I would try something else if you are new and testing WvW. If you really like it and are going to stay, this build is excellent. My 2 cents worth.

I’ve been trying brotha. Opened up each thread I saw, I’ve just been swamped IRL w/work and my kids. Most of the threads I opened talked about futures streams where info would be shared, then today’s thread saying good luck tomorrow. Obviously I missed the streams/info that was shared.

So when you say you say you want less people like me I assume you mean you want more people that care deeply for the game and community, which I assure you I do. I’ve just been away/busy for a while but trying to keep the hope alive I’ll be able to get back into it one day. Glad to see GW2 still has one of the most passionate and caring communities.

The whole area way above the guild hall is very exciting. There are two full levels above the main one. I'm sure most explorers have discovered it but casuals may not have.  We've built a full roller-beetle raceway up through those areas and there is one point where you can jump from the ceiling of the map into the water. That's fun too

Sweet. To my knowledge there was a stream announcing the new mount and map? I’m assuming I can find them on YouTube or twitch? I wouldn’t mind learning more about the details. 
---
That's a no-win proposition for Anet.
---
If they tell us how they think something should be played, people will just complain that Anet's vision of class XYZ doesn't match their own.
---
For the most part, Anet's designs are open ended enough that there are multiple ways to use them.  Being overly prescriptive limits people's freedom to play how they want.
---
ah yes, you're right. That is a dark skinned, Sunspear armor wearing, norn. I just saw the Sunspear armor and thought it's an Elonian guy. 
---
It's a pity. I like this map. I wish they make something to make it alive again. It will be alive for a few weeks after tomorrow's patch, but then it will probably die again.
---
thanks, fixed!

You can always put in buy orders for cheap lvl 68+ rare weapons/armor and salvage what you buy and sell the resulting materials.  You’ll make money off of it.

i think the battle at the end was wonderfully done, quite enjoyed it. too bad it wasnt something less memorable that died. i truly hope that she wont be brought back to life, i hate when that happens in stories generally.

im very curious how we are supposed to defeat kralk now tho. my current theory is that the gods come back help us kill him and then all aborb the same amount of his power to keep the world in balance and the relative strength of all the gods the same. its based on nothing specifc, just the ramblings of a player. i would honestly be surprised if the gods doesnt play some kind of role at least.

I've failed it simply because I got to the map late and even if there were people defending the zerg wasn't large enough to damage him in time.

Max level content especially post-core game content is very hard to complete without exotic gear/decent runes and sigils. Guardian also has surprisingly low tankiness, but is supported a lot with its class mechanic and various traits/abilities.

Too many people getting pissy when "their" Champs got pulled by someone else. So they got turned down to Vet status. But, there's still World Boss Train (not sure if it had moved to the [set time format](http://dulfy.net/2014/04/23/event-timer/) before you left), a HoT (sorta) Map Mata Tour, Silverwastes RIBA, and Domain of Istan (depending on your unlocks; one or more may not be available...). 
---
Here's the [mount trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrjjayEhNYw), and the [gameplay preview](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/388682676).
---
A new map wasn't announced, but someone noticed a new area name so people are speculating that's it's going to be some kind of surprise, or at least that they're working on something that isn't quite ready yet.
---
The thing with Norn is that they don't really have tribes or communities. Nords just hi whevere they feel will give them a taste of adventure, so it's really hard to just get Elonian Norns, cuz if thee were Norns in Elona they wouldn't really make villages and towns and sit down doing agriculture and stuff. They'd be travelling all around trying to hunt massive sand sharks and what not. Norn are big on individualism so even if you find a dark skinned norn really immersed in Elonian culture, chances are there isn't another one like them. 
---
Yikes
---
you are looking at 10s difference(not taking tp fees into account). If your goal is getting T6 mats for leggy I would argue its still better to get the T6 bags and skip the hassle/wait of selling/buying from the TP.
---
Like the person who decided not to allow mounts in combat? Well if he was one of the 100.
---
Just accept your mistake.
---
This. Go for yellow mobs that stand around aside from the usual walking ways. They rarely get killed within days. Mobs who live longer accumulate extra EXP. Happy genociding

If you read the thread some people got pretty toxic with me.
---
I never deleted it.
---
Eotm was never intended to be alive in the first place, it was just a place where people were waiting for queues on proper borderlands while having some of the wvw fun, but in a result of unforeseen circumstances, map was filled with pve players for the sake of farming karma and EXP while running around and taking over the structures in rotation with other servers.
---
There's multiple factors here. OP, are your party members eating mechanics/attacks they should obviously dodge; do you know how to heal on firebrand; or do you simply feel like you need more healing power? If the first option, then get better teammates. If the second, actually look at your skills and traits to see where your main heals come from. If the third, run more healing power. If you have the mistlock mastery unlocked and a 5-stack of the mobility potion you get 1.5*AR to your concentration so it's quite possible that you can drop some harriers for minstrels/magis.
---
I agree. I still have so many mystic kits left (and stones) that I sometimes still use them despite having the silver fed. And now I have like no for mystic stones (or at least none I have use for)
---
I mean, it's still nice to have the silver fed in a shared inventory slot, but I bought it literally for its look. If one is strapped for gold, it's perfectly fine to pass on it. 
---
dont forget wvw dailies like big spender, AND the wvw reward track potions so you can get your GoB with minimal (long term still) effort and just consume all the potions you have banked(80 for a full track completion) BOOM GoB done.

Is it toxic to look on the bright side of what happened?

I managed to get my ranger to the PoF maps and got myself a jacaranda, it's made a big difference. Still not as exciting as elementalist but it's much better than it was :)
---
Yes, you can find the video among past broadcasts on the official GW2 channel, if you haven't found it already. They showed the mount and the abilities

I ask stupid and highly unappropiate questions about layoffs and get toxic comments. This sub is horrible QQ
---
&gt;Morrowind wasn't so much a passion project as a sleep deprived psychedelic fueled miracle that saved Bethesda from bankruptcy.
---
It sounds like I really should read more about the development of that game.
---
&gt;Well you don't need an expert, just someone sufficiently familiar, I'm and Archaeologist, so I know enough about how the evolution of humans works to imagine a semi-believable transition series from a Bearlike skull to a Norn looking skull.
---
I'm a renaissance man. I've taken general classes in basically every science and covered most every area of history and humanities. I have a special interest in evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology.
---
I have the foundation to explore a lot of ideas, but something I've learned is that there's always somebody who knows more, and nothing is ever simple enough that it can be understood by myself alone.
---
Bringing in somebody accredited isn't necessary, strictly speaking. Knowledge is knowledge. A degree doesn't guarantee it. But I would want to make sure I consult with somebody who knows their stuff.
---
I want to talk more about the evolutionary components of your post but I'm running on like 5 hours of sleep across the last 48 hours so the brain is not functioning well right now.
---
fair point. obviously if you want to be quick about it, purchasing what you need directly is a valid and solid option. in light of efficiency however, this will make quite the difference in the long run, and being aware of the option is valuable information, just like the legendary shard conversion.
---
No but a champ train in the first zone of the game doesnt give a great introduction. Plus people running the train would harass new players that were doing events on the map in "the wrong order" and "messing up the train".
---
This made me go back to look at my own vod, I couldn't find a moment where I opened the map but the loading said ["Core Test Lobby"](https://i.imgur.com/3sM608U.jpg) and the [mini map art](https://i.imgur.com/LNpes0r.png) looks different from what we can see in OP.
---
Not getting my hopes up whatsoever, you could be right but also providing more info. If it is just that, don't think it would be too much effort for Anet to just say it is so.
---
So... Who do you hope was included in the 100?
---
I say the one who decided not to let us mount in combat.
---
I wonder why?! It can’t be that you did anything to antagonize everyone, no no, it’s everyone else who is wrong! 
---
Do you not see how that attitude is really inappropriate? Being laid off is a serious thing for people. It's real financial uncertainty. Kids might miss meals. Medicine might not be purchased. We (the public) don't know, but it could mean really tough times for some. 
---
So saying "I didn't like what they added to my video game" is a totally trivial bright side to a really dark situation. Pretending, even for a second, that the two sides are comparable is seriously messed up.
---
That's toxic dude. Reflect on your actions.
---
Horrible auggestion for noobs. 
---
Now, now, scrublet. You get your fair share of pve threads every day.
---
You may think of it as “the bright side” but IMO there is no bright side to individuals losing their current line of livelihood.
---
If you want to accomplish the same thing, consider framing the question differently to satisfy the same intent like:  What changes in direction do you hope to see as a result of anet’s refocus on GW2?
---
To me, the way you asked the question makes you look like a kid who goes to stomp on some other kid’s sand castle then saying “it’s just a prank bro, look at the bright side you can build a new one over there”

A month ago, my friend Cellofrag did a Cello Cover of "Fear Not This Night", the most well known GW2 song.

The new sublime soundtrack from last Guild Wars 2 Living World Episode "All or Nothing", and a tragic ending, all these made him willing to give a last homage to Aurene. Special thanks to ArenaNet &amp; to Maclaine Diemer for providing the sheet music. 
---
Here is his arrangement for 6 Cellos « Aurene, Dragon Full of Light » I hope you’ll enjoy it !  The part from 1:55 to 3:15 was composed by Cellofrag. Sheet Music &amp; Making of are available in description, if anyone interested.

Shit, I was unaware that Taco can do all of this. I actually followed the video guide for golden badges and it was a nightmareish experience. I guess I should finally download it
---
do you accept your mistake
---
agreed. The amount of extra gold you can squeeze out of things by using sites like gw2efficiency and loltools and gw2bltc etc is something more casual players could benefit from being aware of.
---
Yeah I don't think that gonna happen again, ever.
---
I asked a question, who did they hope was included. Then said I hoped the one who decided we can't mount in combat.Is it wrong to ask a question?

There is absolutely always someone who knows more, but the thing to remember to prevent yourself from being paralysed by that thought is, "do I know enough to give it a go?". We can't always have the best expert, but we can always learn more by the doing.

The game is only built to run at a given performance rate even on max settings, if your PC is built To perform higher than that max settings rate then there really isn’t anything the game can do unless Anet allows personal graphical modifications you’re going to be limited by the games performance threshold....

I always end up asking questions that demand such arcane knowledge that I can't really do more than ask an expert. The knowledge is either bleeding edge, or recorded somewhere within the voluminous pool of relevant works - but it could be anywhere. I can choose to dig through the haystack, or consult somebody who has charted the haystack. Generally, it's much more time efficient to do the latter when possible.
---
And it may not always be necessary. But damnit, I want that detail. I love it. I'm a fiend for it. It gets me high.

Grenth take me now.
---
It's competitive but it's not pvp. Pvp is killing players. That's what people want to do in wvw
---
I love that salvage-o-matic idea. I'm a sucker for the asura so anything golem-themed would be really cool.
---
Yes, I see you're intention now but you are obviously looking at it objectively which is hard for people especially with recent events. And it came off as insensitive because it is a bit too soon for it. If you were following Reddit during the lay offs; people were freaking out over their favorite game and their dear devs were leaving. So your question made it light as well an encourage more lay offs because you hate the dev or something.
---
I am speaking to you objectively about the matter. I love this game and constantly think of it but not can remove myself. I can't do that everytime.  
---
Doesn't have to be something that's necessarily full on ranged, just something with a lot of aoe potential since frankly it's one of the main things ranger lack aside from LB 5.
---
No, competition between players against other players is PVP. Otherwise 90% of wvw roaming is pve. Wvw has always been a hybrid mode and what it has needed is more situations that force worlds to do something more than kill each other.
---
Impossible! Where is the norn fat transfer I paid for!

I've been a ranger main since release, but never jumped into WvW, can someone enlighten me on why a weapon projectile is a detriment? Just because it's easy to line of sight away?

To complete this, you may want to check https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/ . It's a list of guilds that teach people how to raid.

Guardian pre-patch can overcap significantly with just berserker gear and power ferocity food. If you're running any content in a group, you should assume you're getting boons and that's exactly how optimal gear is calculated. This is especially true when support classes are used. 
---
Also, Pack runes are amazing with boon-focused/boon-heavy classes and builds, such as mesmer or ranger (especially Soulbeast). In fact, it's currently meta for support Chronos, at least in raids.
---
Story has definitely improved since HoT, but you'll probably end up with your own opinion. I thought HoT was okay, but disappointingly rushed.

Both. You can understand something like that on an academic level, but to Grok it you need to unravel your brain a bit.

&gt;consult somebody who has charted the haystack.

Honestly this is what a Bachelors is. It's training you how to navigate the haystack of human knowledge. That and having access to a Unis Journal subs and libraries in order to practice that skill. And a couple dozen grand of debt to motivate you via the sunken cost fallacy into finishing.

GW2 is a CPU-bound game on modern systems.  Rarely will it tax a modern graphics card to the point of slowing things down.
---
Measuring "CPU usage" in a multi-core environment is a bit tricky. The game just isn't that well-optimized for multi-core machines and the way it uses them is just going to show up a bit wonky.  Modern games fare better (and use the GPU more effectively) because their engines were designed with this sort of environment in mind. Ultimately though, it's hard to say with absolute certainty what the bottlenecks are because we don't have the code for the game engine.
---
HoT's kept every one of my friends entertained for 12 months before they started to finish all zone/meta achievements and collections, the legendary collections were amazing and i loved every one of them. 
---
LWS 3 and 4 have been mediocre none of the maps where memorable. Going straight into 5 may very well see ncsoft pull the plug because there is no way anets profits are going up if all they aspire to is the steadiness of 1 bland forgettable map every 4-5 months.

The CEO of NCSoft West e-mailed employees of ArenaNet about their upcoming dismissal and you say it is just the digital release?  
---
Publishing is much more than that. I will try to explain it.
---
A publisher handles the production, marketing and distribution of a computer game.
---
NCSoft financed the development and monitors the developing progress as backer ( I suppose Guild Wars would not even exist without NCSoft, and ArenaNet relied on the publisher for GW 2 as well). Up until the recent events ArenaNet had much more freedom (due to the success of the game series). Now NCSoft is cost cutting. Guild Wars 2 revenue declined over the years since its 2012 launch, though, which likely led NCSoft to this decision. 
---
&gt; **Yoon added that the company plans to “cut costs across the organization” and restructure across the board, merging ArenaNet and NCSoft’s publishing divisions in the process. “The restructuring, cost-cutting, and strategic realignments are all being done to secure our tomorrow and to provide the foundation that will allow us to grow and acquire,” she wrote.** 
---
I think this was a necessary step and hopefully in the right direction.
---
ArenaNet had his chance, but could not cope, or did not bring the desired results.

Check out dota2 and look at some Roshan pit fights. Its a pve boss that drops items that give a huge advantage to the team that gets them. It causes epic pvp fights over who will have access to either safely fight in the pit, or try to catch out the other team while grouped up.
---
Allows great opportunities for ambushes and counter plays and strategy. For example, if one team is outnumbered and cant win the fight, thay might choose to take a keep or something while the other teams are fighting it out.
---
Yuck that music...

And suggested that the dev who decided that mounts shouldn't be usable in combat be fired.

I'm pretty sure I was clear in my wording. Whether you can comprehend that or not is beyond my control.

I've stopped doing Fractals some time before the the instability rework. After reading all this new unfun stuff I decided to keep it that way.

I just got my wife into the game (well 1.5 months ago).
---
We went through from the start together, I had my mount/gliding, but I refrained from using it for the most part. On occasion, I'd use them and use portal to help her get hard to get vista's or whatnot.
---
shouldn't be too difficult assuming you're not split between NA and EU, if that's the case you won't be able to find each other.  Besides that it should just be a matter of going to the starting area where your friend is and finding them to party up.
---
Dear lord! What is happening in there!?
---
bring me the searing cauldron
---
IT'S JUST A PHALLUS
---
The problem is that it's too symmetrical to replace a Borderland, which is the only map there's a double of. It could only be added as a fifth map (splitting the players on a server even more and most likely resulting in another map dead as Desert), reworked with a central castle and put in as a replacement for EBG (can you imagine the riots?), or completely rebuilt and rebalanced as a Borderland equivalent with a Garrison, central spawn location, proper camps, etc (at which point it would probably be easier to just make a new map from scratch).
---
A two months ago, my friend Cellofrag did a Cello Cover of "Fear Not This Night", the most well known GW2 song.
---
The new sublime soundtrack from last Guild Wars 2 Living World Episode "All or Nothing", and a tragic ending, all these made him willing to give a last homage to Aurene. Special thanks to ArenaNet &amp; to Maclaine Diemer for providing the sheet music.
---
Here is his arrangement for 6 Cellos « Aurene, Dragon Full of Light » I hope you’ll enjoy it ! The part from 1:55 to 3:15 was composed by Cellofrag. Sheet Music &amp; Making of are available in description, if anyone interested.
---
EDIT: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! All credit and love goes to Cellofrag, I'm just a messenger.
---
I never liked how none organically the maps looked. Like why make it a huge box? Just make it look like a proper landmass with natural "barriers" 
---
Look for a group from :59 onwards and it's almost a guaranteed failure.
---
Assuming you're both in the same mega-server (only options are NA or EU) and you know each other's account name, you can add each other as friends and be able to communicate. You have to be mutual friends to whisper each other. Until level 10 you'll only have access to the starter maps, but you should have a waypoint automatically unlocked in each of them so you can meet up in game.

---
I know, but it doesn't really go well with any heavy armor that I own the skins for.
---
If you want to get into raiding, I'd suggest taking a look at what classes you play or want to play, as well as what sort of role you want to play (DPS, healer, support), then look up a build that fits that and start working towards it. Metabattle has some decent builds, but Snow Crows tends to have the best builds with the most in depth guides and analysis. You definitely want at least full exotic armor, weapons, and trinkets, and preferably at least some ascended trinkets to start. Ascended armor is probably the least important of the three to get, so don't worry too much about that for now. I still have only exotic armor.
---
Look either online, in your guild(s)/friends, in the LA Aerodrome (just past the Fractal and WvW portals in south LA), or in lfg for training groups/runs. It helps to type in "train" or "training" in the lfg search, plus you can filter out words like "-exp," "-kp," (kill proof) or "-sell." Casual groups might also be willing to help a new player.
---
For your first boss, I'd recommend either Vale Guardian (VG, the first boss of Spirit Vale), Cairn (the first boss of the Bastion of the Penitent), or Escort (not actually a boss, but counts as one, the first encounter in the Stronghold of the Faithful). Bandit Trio/Prison Camp also isn't super difficult, and is just an encounter like Escort, but is in the middle of Salvation Pass instead of the beginning. VG and Cairn are both relatively mechanics light, have no party wipe mechanics or DPS checks, and are relatively forgiving, plus they're easy to find training runs for. Escort is also simple (kill enemies, protect Glenna, deactivate towers), especially if you're not doing towers (usually one or two people take the towers, or a mesmer gets to them and ports people up and back to help capture them), the only instakill mechanic (besides Glenna dying) is stepping into a mine, and the whole mission is just fighting normal enemies and a miniboss at the end.
---
Thanks! This'll be handy to know.
---
Just use OS then...
---
What's weird is that when I logged in I was at the aerodrome with the floating chest saying event complete etc. GW2Bot tells me that I've completed the boss too. Maybe whilst my internet went I was inside the instance when the boss was killed before the server realised I was offline?
---
It all starts at forge master Hilina near the forge. I am pretty sure there is a wiki page for at least the collection side of the weapon aquisition. They are called dragonsblood weapons. But I for myself never used it. It is pretty straight forward and besides for the achievement progress quite clearly marked ingame. You will unlock one collection for the exotic versions first and with every weapon you craft Hilina will have more and more things to say about legendary or at least famous characters and there weapons. Sure there are some locations and enemys you have to find but to figure this out was the most fun part of the process. At least for me. It felt like mini quests despite it mostly happend inside of the achievment UI. :D
---
Don't know if you can get the exotic weapons via pvp but I would highly doubt it.

I have everything for the stellar weapons waiting on a bank character but am still missing on quite some kralkatite ore. Had to put that on hold for the dragonsblood weapons but it is my next goal to finish this project too. Just for the sake of completion.
---
Can't show mine, I used them as a base to unlock all my missing ascended skins ^^
---
I thought farming the kralk ore would be tedious for the longest time. thats why I never attempted it at release. but its pretty easy. just farm the hearts like in TP. each heart gives 25.

Chrono certainly involves a more fundamental understanding of your skills and traits, compared to other classes where you can frequently get away with mashing your rotation. That being said, if you don’t need to be optimized, you can definitely just do the basics at first and slowly work your way up. IMO, casual fractals (even up to chill T4 groups) are a good place to practice and learn chrono, people won’t care as much about the boon uptime as they do in raids. Good understanding will come with time and practice in real fights
---
The main thing you need to learn is your Continuum Split (CS) opener. Understand how to start CS in the aftercast of a skill (e.g. shield5) and fit everything in the window (the window becomes 1.5sec longer for each clone you had up when you started CS). The other thing is your utilities. Wells pulse boons only when they end.  SoI only extends existing boons on party members. Mimic makes the next utility skill used have a 1sec cooldown.
---
Knowing this, you can get away with just doing your opener and then using utilities + shield5 off cooldown. That should be enough boons to get your group through daily fractals. Once you’ve become used to maintaining that in real fights, you can start learning when to take certain traitlines for cc or aegis share, take focus for mob pull, manage clones, squeeze out extra dps, portal, and more. Chrono’s versatility and wide range of utilities make it really satisfying to play once you’ve gotten used to it :)
---
did that with the stellar set, because marshall stats. the diviner stats on the dragonsblood weapons are to good to "waste".
---
Hello guys im about to beginn with gw2. Played wow and eso and some other little mmos before.
---
Im currently searching for a class and spec i want to start with and get into the game. My problem at the moment is that there are so many specs and weapons. I dont know what i should play.
---
Was searching post and guide the last 3 days but still dont know what to play.
---
So im here to ask you guys what class fits me the most. From my searching i think its (sorry do not remember all the exact names):
---
Guardian: fire thing
---
Engineer: holosmith
---
Revenant 
---
Mesmer
---
What do i want from this class or what i have in mind.
---
First off all i want this setup and spec to be viable on pvp and pve. Dont need to be nr1 build but i want to be viable in both scenes. So i can do the pve content and also have a chance in pvp (think i will mainly focus on pvp content)
---
Playstyles i like in other mmos:
---
Demonhunter: massiv mobility, high sustained dmg and lifesteal (dual wield/two fu**ing glaives*.*/can tranform into a real demon)
---
Paladin: heavy armor, selfhealing, burst dmg
---
Deathknights: heavy armor, good dmg, melee spellcaster "battlemage" can also be dual wield
---
I would like to be able to not rely on a healer to be viable in pvp or solo content.
---
I really like to wear double swords/glaives (pls not daggers i hate daggers) and heavy armor.
---
Perfect class (i think):
---
Dual sword/glaive (can also be transmogged if possible)
---
Heavy armor
---
Bruiserplaystyle (not squishy, and can deal good dmg when able to stick on enemy)
---
Selfsustain (selfhealings or life steal)
---
Maybe some magic for the pew pew
---
Hope you can help me find my class and spec. I read often that some class are hard to master but i do not really care about it. I like theoriecrafting and learning rotations or situational moves. So i dont care about hard to master things.
---
Thx for the help
---
"Fake it till you make it" as I always say

This.  I have never once heard a commander asking for rangers.  It's always the opposite: commanders complaining about rangers

---
Congrats 
---
* Introduce **dungeon-specific backpieces**
---
* Add ascended armour/weapon tiers for the dungeon vendors. Same skin as the specific dungeon armour and weapon too
---
* Add a bit more ascended trinkets specific to dungeons with various stats combo too
---
LB auto and LB 2 are projectiles that arc so you can actually hit people over the 1500 range but it's not overly consistent.
---
The arrow projectile continues even past 1500 range instead of getting deleted (I believe bullets do this) so if you're shooting at a downward angle (like from the top of a wall to someone on the ground), you can get WAY more than 1500 range hits. I'd say the max possible range is around 2000 units.
---
Like all skills with a range (so... all skills?), their reach is actually slightly further than what is written on the skill.
---
As to how much, I don't know, but from maining as a ranger for 6 years, I am always able to hit targets even when my skills show the red "out of range" line.
---
Granted, I am only just slightly "out of range"!
---
that too \*rip\*

Ros is using rangers . Often to focus opposing side commander and brag how good they are.

Aye, but well they have their uses. Like killing cannons in sm easier than other classes.

With a static, dedicated group, you can assume you'll have 100% uptime for might, retal, banners, alacrity, and quickness + spotter. 
---
What you're talking about is Open World content. Scholar runes aren't seen as much there but are typically the rune of choice for fractals, raids, dungeons, etc. Optimal gear is much less important in Opel World situations, as the few extra percent DPS you can pump out with better gear won't make a difference when 30 other people are hitting the same boss. However, you hitting the optimal skill rotation vs just auto attacking and randomly using skills (as too many people do in Open World) will increase your damage significantly more than the gear would. A DH in a raid with exotic berserker gear and flame legion runes with a perfect rotation will still pump more damage than someone in ascended gear with scholar runes and might infusions that has a sloppy rotation. 
---
When the game launched you could actually buy official cases I know at the very least they had Logan, Rytlock, and the logo. You couple probably still find these on eBay if you wanted one.

Overall the best comment I have read. 
---
they say more ranged not more rangers aka necros revs eles &lt;:
---
100% this. 
---
Okay, so I'm going to try and break-down the points you are making:
---
&gt; dual-wielding swords and glaives
---
So GW2 does not have a glaive weapon type. The only professions that can dual-wield sword are: Revenant, Warrior, and Mesmer.
---
&gt;viable in PvE and PvP
---
Every class has something viable in both, but it wont be the exact same build. Good thing is, PvP builds are pretty much saved in the PvP battlegrounds, the only thing you may need to remember to swap for are weapons. 
---
 As far as this point goes with the previous one though, The most viable dual-swords build in PvP at the very least will be on Revenant. In PvE, it depends on if you want to do "end-game" PvE or not. If you just want to focus on exploring and basic PvE, just about anything (within reason) goes as long as you enjoy it. You can definitely sword/sword warrior or Revenant in PvE stuff but not so much in raids for example. 
---
&gt;can be transmogged
---
We have a wardrobe system to everything can be "transmogged" as long as it's the same weapon or armor class (e.g. sword can take the skin of another sword, heavy helmet or another heavy helmet, etc.) 
---
&gt; sustain/self-heal
---
Every class has sustain skills built into your skill bar. Just about every class has good build setups that can improve sustain, along with what stats you have on your equipment.
---
&gt; heavy armor
---
Revenant, Guardian and Warrior are our 3 heavy armors
---
Overall, I'm thinking you'd want to try revenant out. Keep in mind, this class is tied to the first expansion, Heart of Thorns, so you would need to purchase it if you want to play it. Otherwise, go for guardian or warrior, they're both heavy and can have that mobility/sustain/etc gameplay without using daggers that you don't like. Guardian can't dual wield swords though. 
---
6th? oh hell. I think I need to contemplate my life now.
---
Tried using d912pxy?
---
Y'all are matched up with FA this rotation. Get used to tier 1.5.
---
No. He definitely said more rangers. 
---
I'm in CD and currently in alliance with you guys. Your people are definitely friendlier than some people on our server. I just called out a commander from CD a couple of days ago for acting like an elitist with his guild. To be honest, CD has very small population and making people uninvited is definitely not helping at all. And as if they achieved anything. All I saw was them feeding constantly. I command too and it is much better to boost people's morale than destroy it. I am with MINT, and we are far friendlier than all the other guilds in Crystal Desert. 
---
FA: somehow chill and salty, pugmanders always on almost, we also have Chilla who is our helpful mascot. Too many random good people to mention 
---
Did you not bother reading the description parts of the balance patch notes?
---
&gt; We considered enhancing the banner skills, but we don't want banners to be alternate weapons that take away from a player's normal weapons.
---
A good yoga or dance class would probably be enjoyable 😆
---
I like the engineer, it has alot of different skills you can play around with. Ranger was my first class and is probably the one I'd consider my main but it's a fairly straightforward playstyle.
---
your spellings and grammar are too correct, 0/10 bad monkey impression
---
A tip is to just make a character that seems interesting, then jump into the PvP lobby and try attacking some dummies.  
---
It'll give you a very basic taste for what the class has to offer.  
---
Plus, you get to try out the different specializations for each class.  
---
are you serious? if yes this is insanely narrowed. holy fuuu 
---
Yeap. Collecting skins isn't content for me, sorry.
---
A person crafted a legendary \[Binding of Ipos\] and linked it on map chat, some of us congratulated him, me included. A random person asked me whats so special about it, i responded him the reason. + add some colourblind struggles
---
"Okay I need to go take a shit."
---
Blackgate: elitists who aren't even good
---
You do realise that this post in a month old and the moment have past. But thanks for posting i guess.
---
You got my attention now
---
He is T-posing????
---
I think he meant they won't release another xpac. 
---
What's the point of crafting celestial armor over that long time when you can get stat select armor sets from tracks in PvP and WvW in far less time, while getting gold and other ressources on top of it ?
---
Crafting exotics is pretty much a waste 90+% of the time in the current game, crafting anything with HoT/PoF stats or Celestial is madness.
---
Stop forgetting you get a LOT of ways to get exotic gear that are better than crafting (there is the WvW vendors too now from memory).
---
Carrying the main server as always 
---
Yes it's still on!! 
---
I'm brand new too and I personally use Ranger with a long bow, let my pet take aggro for me while I just spam arrows, it works well for open world from what I can tell. 
---
Double axe warrior's 5th ability is amazing too! 
---
lol...... i knew without doubt on reading the title that there would be a Monkey comment. thank you
---
" I don't like healing at all. That's more of my wife's thing." So cliche, haha.  
---
Basically, all class can play DPS with the appropriate build.
---
I'm an elementalist nerd, if you enjoy challenging content with high skill cap &amp; big DPS, you should test it :)
---
I know what you trying to do. But you have to read it again :)
---
One part of this post is about what i played in other mmos and what was fun for me (mobility) and the other part is about what i would like to play. And beeing tanky and dealing good dmg when stick on enemy + sustain when sticking on enemys is the whole idea behind playing a bruiser style.
---
Sounds like they're at least dedicated to their cause.
---
Thanks OP for this snapshot. It has brightened up my day hahahahhahahahahhaha
---
...what mating!
---
I saw it happen once. The people went back from a battery way too early, so the mobs managed to destroy it. The failure of the mission created a giant tsunami that killed every player inside the beach. 
---
Useless to say that almost nobody used the teleport to move back.
---
I've noticed the lowering of levels in zones that are lower; it's more of a tradition thing since we've done this for several games. I just want something to happily steamroll through mobs with. I'm just unsure what I'll enjoy most.
---
There's at least one hater in the team chat. 
---
I've seen some painted cases, or engraved acrylic, but I was thinking a full on custom case enclosure.

Mesmer elite spec with rifle or main hand pistol would be fun.
---
If you have an expansion and want something simple and relaxing to level, revenant has a very easy rotation and is fun to play while leveling.  Use Shiro/Jalis as your legend swaps and put points into dwarf and assassin until you have the hammers and impossible odds.  Kill everything by auto attacking and turning on either hammers or IO.  When you run out of energy, swap legends and turn the other one on (if you put them in the same utility slot you can use the same button for both.  If you want variety you can use skills 2-5.

Stop posting pictures of me on the internet, it’s embarrassing!

I mean its easy to mistaken the purple (legendary) text for a darker blue under a certain light on a monitor, i played on laptop and i tilted it a bit to see and it turned out darkish blue so yeah, its easy to confuse.
---
But if he had colourblindness he would also say that the text we were whispering in was also blue-ish, not yellow. Unless he meant the map chat thing you linked then yes.
---
I'm worried that I'll lose interest in the ranger once I collect all the different pets. But I'm thinkin of tryin it anyway. 
---
Depends what content you want to do really, as the what professions do will change based on the game mode (talking from a meta perspective).
---
In terms of PvE (dungeons, fractals, raids), Mesmer is very good for solo/low-man content in addition to having a strong support role and good damage builds (both power and condition based). Necromancer has two damage based builds (power and condition) and has a support build (considered a healer, it specializes in ressing downed players). Mesmer is one of the more difficult professions to learn but it is very enjoyable.
---
Personally, I've been a Warrior main for a good 4 years or so now. I can play every other class at a decent level in raids and fractals, but Warrior is my one true love. I love its fast paced rotations and the condition-based Discipline Berserker build is by far my favorite build in the game, although it is the most difficult Warrior build to play. In PvE, Warrior is considered to be an offensive support (they provide buffs to the party) but they can pump out very competitive DPS if built properly.
---
GW2 shines most in the fact that it is a very alt friendly game. I would suggest getting every class to level 80 as you can enjoy every profession when you find the right builds for them and having them at level cap will greatly benefit you in the long run.
---
Just go ahead and use [https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases)

whoseold?
---
Wait, Monkey from DB? Refresh-siege, meet-my-insta-iggy Monkey?
---
I definitely used them to get to previously locked areas of my gh before we finished unlocking them. Well, these and super clouds. 
---
En/Mo
---
Oh okay. I didn't know that was a thing. I have a couple of boosts that I was playing with on my mesmer to see if 
---
I enjoyed the mesmer enough to boost it. 
---
Honestly I was hoping they would normalize banners &amp; ranger spirits so that they would all provide stat boosts to specific stats depending on the spirit/banner (the exception being water spirit &amp; battle standard)
---
Then let warrior and ranger have an elite trait that causes each to grant a different boon depending on the spirit/banner.
---
Across him is probably a reaper in shroud form
---
That's how it is though lol. I'm the kick ass and take names gal and she tries to keep me alive. She had tried the elementalist and decided it wasn't for her so maybe I should give it a whirl.
