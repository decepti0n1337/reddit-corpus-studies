yea, for an expansion. not Like one, Anet
---
---
---
You just hung out at the top for almost 2 years, enjoy being somewhat balanced for once!
---
&gt;Because people used addons that gave them more templates
---

---
After years and years of asking for templates but never getting them, mind you. Templates existed in GW1. If you think it's blown out of proportion, that's your right, but the fact is Anet is \*way\* late to the party on functionality that already kind of existed within their engine since 2007.
---
Im not saying some skills cant be confused with cheating, but today i saw in stream a downed deadeye (as in downed state) teleport twice in a row like 4000 units, the dude move to the other corner almost inside a tower, while being downed.
---
Another occasion in the same stream i could enjoy a warrior rally 6 times in a row, with no trash mobs around.  
---
Call the streamer unlucky but that is a lot of weird stuff going on in the 2 hours i watched the stream.
---
What are you expecting. For profit businesses do what will bring them revenue.
---
Do you enjoy grinding open world endlessly to earn gold and buy shinies?  You'll enjoy GW2
---
Do you enjoy swiping  your credit card every 2 weeks to play dress up?  You'll enjoy GW2
---
Do you enjoy meaningful progression or endgame such as dungeons or raids?  You'll hate GW2
---
They can't lock unlocked novelties again, so that would always happen
---
The relationship between a game developer and consumers is a fundamentally adversarial one. They want to charge as much as possible, we want to pay as little as possible. Especially so in GaaS games -- because ANet doesn't charge for content updates (or at least, not enough to sustain development), they have to nickel and dime players at every *other* opportunity, and buying quality of life feels worse for players than buying content or cosmetics.
---
There isn't really a productive conversation to be had between players and management about how much monetization is too much, so a company just has to try things out. If they've gone too far over the line, the player base riots. If enough people riot, the company is forced to walk it back. If not enough people riot, then it blows over after a while.
---
The companies that have a healthier relationship with their players -- like Grinding Gear -- seem to do so by establishing early on what they will and will not charge for, and sticking to it.
---
Legend!
---
Still waiting on my refund, so hold that pitchfork a bit, please.
---
Putting aside all the discussions about monetization or not, the only thing I still can't grasp is why the limit is so arbitrary and so low. I know my way when it comes to coding/best practices, and the number is just off. Why 6? Why 24 per account?
---
Is the problem saving all these templates on their servers? Why don't they just save it client-side and say "it's saved client-side, so if you uninstall the game you might lose all your saved builds"
---
In the end, prohibiting the current build templates from further development to try to guarantee their revenue is probably going to hurt them more than help
---
[Shrouded Bench of the Final Judge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shrouded_Bench_of_the_Final_Judge)
---
I thought you meant monetary compensation, to be fair. Although even an in-game cameo is something that I don't think will happen. It's a 3rd party tool that was allowed, but still isn't something that I can see ANet acknowledging.
---
As for him/her "helping them create a build template design"...that's really pushing it. Build templates are nothing revolutionary to begin with, so how much did he/she innovate here?
---
The sad thing is necros have never really been in a good high-end PvE place, except for those 6 months where Lich Form minions were hilariously broken.
---
Weak. They should have fixed the in-game item to –you know– not be so disappointing. I would have actually bought it.
---
On my, admittedly ancient at this point, CPU GW2 spreads the load pretty much evenly across all 4 cores. That probably means I just need to upgrade already, but it makes the exaggerated claim of it being single threaded that happens every time the topic of optimization comes up more grating to me personally.
---
yea or this sub's favourite, ff14 which if i'm not mistaken double dips on the monetization by having both subscription and cash-only shop
---
but no..it's anet nickle and diming with the equivalent of 150g in game
---
It's a long term investment.
---
If the item drop is rare enough, rare, the stacked 'barons' watching all tansationcs can keep a TP window open and intercept all sales to put them higher. And there's also TP bots.
---
Players who never get it as a drop can only resort to the trading post, but if the item is rare enough, the sales won't be fast to sneak past the eyes watching the TP, and they esentially hijack the item inserting themselves as middlemen.
---
I also suspect they don't have a lot of programmers. I would even argue most of them are green. I did a lot of modding for myself during the years and I have experienced how working with something you don't fully understand feels and the end result is %90 held together with rubber bands and duct tape hence the infamous spagetti code.
---
I'd rather they just go ahead and make GW3 and design their monetization with this in mind from the ground up. Adding a subscription/battle pass to a game this old with this old of an engine that is showing serious strains just isn't all that.. Feasible. If anything, I'd rather have small expansion packs then.
---
To increase your chances, you should specify EU or US, and also what hours you play.
---
This is beyond expectation. There's already the same pose(Judgement), position may be different but instead of fixing that they just draw another banner? Drawing a banner looks like more work to me.
---
And again charrs get stuffed in a chair, nice poses are only for humanoid. Wow thanks.
---
&gt;Are there actually any other quests anywhere that I'm missing? 
---
The hearts and events are the quests in this game
---
&gt;Or is the game really more about exploring the map?
---
During the leveling experience, largely yes, and it's also about learning your class. Try dungeons too when you can (first one at level 30/35), those might be a little more to your liking
---
&gt; Does the game start to open up more at 80?
---
Significantly, the leveling in many ways can be thought of as a large tutorial section for you to learn how to play. There's a lot more to do at max level, with more active repeatable content and goals to aim for
---
&gt; Or is there really just much more of a pvp focus to the game
---
The game is actually largely PvE focused, although there are PvP game modes (sPvP, WvW) that you can do too. I'd recommend waiting until level cap to do WvW because gear matters, but sPvP has normalized gear and levels so you can jump in anytime
---
&gt; and not much in the way of pve content while leveling up?
---
Kind of summarizing everything else, it's a lot of exploration, events, and learning your class while you're leveling up
---
The only time I ever asked for refunds from them gemstore related was years ago when I bought multiple executioner's axe outfits long before they came out with shared inventory slots, long before a novelty system, and felt annoyed because I returned to the game after a few years of not playing to find out that I wasted like 2400 gems. They refunded the gems to me and didn't remove the axes. I still have them to this day actually.
---
So I wouldn't be so quick to claim that they won't allow people to keep the chairs. I already read a few comments saying they kept the chair and got refunds.
---
It is dying
---
That is what people wanted. I'd guess some technical limitation or maybe a policy of not storing user data locally might be partially to blame.
---
it's a price i'm willing to pay
---
plus sometmes i have the "correct" opinion to compensate and some people find my shitposts entertaining and they smash that like button
---
\&gt;  I'm not a coder so I'm not real in tune with just how challenging this was to implement. But I can say when GW2 launched it had a VERY different design philosophy than GW1 
---
Worth noting that for all this VERY different design philosophy, GW2 still used the GW1 engine. There might need to be some retrofitting, but the system was there back in the GW1 days, \*and\* a modder made a system from the outside completely in his free time on his own. It's doing it \*plenty\* of justice.
---
erp is the true end game
---
How so? We're already lowest DPS in PvE. All this nerf did was make the class more annoying/clunky to play and lower our dps in certain situations. That isn't balance, that is making changes without understanding the consequences, Sure, we needed a nerf in pvp/wvw but there are still tons of annoying/cancer builds left untouched on other classes.
---
I kmkw it's a long term investment, but there are way higher profit long term investments. This is just genuine shit profit.
---
Godforbid you pay for actual content instead of some QoL thing.
---
Bottlenecked by single core performance and "limited to one core" are not the same statements. GW2 has a main thread which is usually the performance bottleneck, but it does offload some work to other threads. In a true single core machine, all the threads have to share that one core and performance does suffer.
---
So yes, improving single core performance is the main way to get lower frametimes in GW2, but the extra cores are doing stuff and do contribute to performance.
---
Well, I don't have to play for QoL to play the game. But I HAVE to pay for the content to play the game. OF COURSE I'd rather pay for something optional.
---
Hm... the feature is great but the trails on the map do not align wery well with them on the terrain for parts that are far away from your character's position. This can be well seen with the new beetle race on grothmar valley when you look at the bridges. Maybe it is a rounding or accuracy issue.
---
For the longest time the two highest DPS in my raid static for most encounters was a Power Reaper and a Condi Soulbeast, even though neither build has been considered top tier going by benchmarks or popular opinion. However, that doesn't matter as much as the quality of player playing the build, and how comfortable they are with it.
---
Some folks are prejudiced against certain classes, and there's definitely a stigma attached to Necro that works against it. However, give folks a chance and sometimes you get some great damage dealers.
---
Already fixed it, see my comment above :)
---
Ah I see, you want the game to be completely free while *other* people pay for its development, whilst ignoring paid content selling well would incentivize the devs to focus on that. Gotcha.

---
Unpopular opinion here... I love that Anet is adding INGAME rewards, NOT GEMSTORE REWARDS, that are incredibly prestigious and just straight up impossible and annoying to get. Because I feel like this game lacks that, everyone has at least 10 legendary pieces of gear right now and there's 0 cool things in the game. I don't think a metal fan T-shirt as armor slot is really that EPIC thing I was looking for, but I hope they add more of this. EVERYTHING in the game is too easy to get and it's just kinda boring.
---
&gt;  I'd guess some technical limitation
---
Call me cynical, but I'm gonna guess it's more like an aptitude limitation, i.e. their programmers don't know how the fuck to actually do things with the engine anymore.
---
FAIR!
---
BoyC, you are amazing.  Lemme try and derail.  Have a link to any cool recent demos?
---
For skills and traits, it should be perfectly possible since it's basically saving the same data we'll be able to link in chat already.
---
For templates including the stats in the gear and upgrades, it would have to include either a system that searches for gear with those stats in your inventory and in gear loadouts, or a system to unlock stats and upgrades for the account and load them up for a cost, without having to use the mystic forge method, since no no one should be expected to get full legendary gear on all characters.
---
Kind of what I was afraid of. I guess I'll at least tough it out until a dungeon to see what that's like, then maybe try to push for 80.
---
People downvote here for the oddest reasons.  :/

that's cuz people don't understand the difference between a third party program that can eat your items and it's fine..it has a disclaimer saying it and everything
---
they can't really do that with an in-game feature, can they? so that leaves us with the shittier version for now sadly
---
i'm not excited about the 6 gear template cap either but for one reason or another it's the best they could come up with..don't you think they would make as many as possible available to increase sales? they just can't 
---
as for the per-character aspect, it's lame but it was to be expected since bags function the same way

Assnet will always be trash.
---
you have the right idea.
---
1. necro has low dps compared to other classes
---
2. pugs usually play worse, so the pug necro gets even worse results than pug dragonhunter for example
---
3. a lot of players are immature jerks who watch too much twitch and think they're edgy memers (thats the one who blocked you)
---
that being said, anyone who kicks you from pug for being necro is retarded. pugs by default are suboptimal gatherings of mediocre players using mediocre strats (with few outliers), not focused on speed clears. so who cares?
---
Well they are heading in the wrong direction if they want to get vets back into their game but maybe they are just about new players now. Here is what [GW1 templates looked like just txt files](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gwwikia/images/f/f8/Skill_template.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20070415051120)  My folder has 399 templates and keep in mind this is free in guild wars 1. And yes i know they need to make money but amost everything is on the gemstore in Guildwars 2 but i did not expect this to be silly me.

There's more than one person leeching off the rest of the player's luck and hard work. They have to diversify or they'll concentrate too much of their efforts in too few items, and get less overall profit.
---
Not only that, but most of their quotes are literally from the comments on here.  I noticed a few other websites related to different things do the same thing.  If you're just going to quote reddit all the time, what's really the point of your website?  I guess to try and make money off reddit and other people's opinions?
---
Your experience means shit then. I always play on minimum requirements for most games because my computer is 14yo and it runs games just fine, decently. And i'm talking about more than 100 games for this. Even shooters where you need to move a lot doesn't lose much fps on frenetic action.  
---
Recommended requirements are for stuff like shadows or fancy effects, bloom, more distance loaded on open-world maps, etc. Those are totally non-needed to complete the game but the FPS are fine, it is never a slideshow.
---
I'm leveling Guardian for Firebrand, but should I use Sword or Axe for leveling as my mainhand?
---
I use them everywhere, along with their green/yellow equivalents. I love how they look when in combat, they feel clean and premium.
---
&gt; as well as giving newer player more incentive to play in order to get legendary gear
---
Heh, or maybe to give people who have been playing since launch more incentive to get legendary gear. 
---
Aww, who am I kidding.
---
There's a blog post on the GW2 site and a stream on the GW2 twitch, facebook or youtube channels.
---
Arcdps is a damn hack. It's a great tool, but it's completely unworkable as a general-purpose thing that can be dropped in to the game. There is an enormous damn difference between a tool that basically functions by replicating mouse clicks, and a tool that is built into the game and interacts with the inventory database. It's also only used by people who, by definition, are power users, which means it does not need to be as user-friendly and intuitive as a system that ships with the game. 
---
The system that they've shown **is** quality. Watch the stream; the system looks beautiful. It functions as you would expect it to function. It's pretty, fast, and most importantly it's going to be safe for all users to use. And a big part of why it works the way it does is because it stores the gear in the system in equipment templates. The natural result of that design is that the equipment templates are going to be more limited than a system that functions as an autoclicker. 
---
That is why I said the community shouldn't have gotten their hopes up with arcdps. I've been saying for years that gear templates are going to be more difficult in this game because of how gear works. It's really not ANet's fault that the same power users who used arcdps the most are somehow incapable of seeing these innate differences in system specs for official gear templates.
---
Ok. So you are unreasonable and refuse to see another's point of view. Cool bro. Glad it is enough for you and hope your 12 toons across 3 games that have plenty can continue to bring you joy. Happy Wednesday.

bro 😎💪

Right. I'll just leave this here for reference.

---
The way these new lower level APIs give you a performance boost is by making you write much of what the dx9/dx11 era drivers do. To simply replace an existing engine's (with the complexity of GW2) lower levels wouldn't necessarily bring the performance upgrades you hope unless the higher pipeline and even the content is optimized to use the new possibilities.
---
Because that is exactly the system that ffxiv has in place? 1 character as many classes or builds as you need.
---
Greatsword. (And you can only use Axe when reach lvl 80, master all Specilization lines, then begin to learn Firebrand.)
---
Emilgia.1714 add me!
---
No organized groups left in WvW to try it on...
---
This is true, but the market is also a lot bigger than it was twenty years ago
---
Huh? I'm asking why they can't due the thing that arcDPS already does, not what you suggested in your second paragraph.
---
Watch out, they might add this and charge per map/achievement.
---
Necros were in a poor spot for a long time as far as group content is concerned, some players are slow to adapt with the changes. Necro is also viewed as a class favoured by noobier players. So when you are already getting pugs and expecting the bar to be low some people dont want to roll the dice on a necro. Most people are also stuck in the mind set that necros are trash and thats not really the case. Necro can compete just fine with other pugs for dps.
---
The player that kicked you, then taunted you, then blocked you is a idiot, they probably also think of reaper as a tanky class because of the shroud and will take hits to the face because shroud. Reaper has 2 traits that give a total of 600 ferocity in shroud so using shroud to tank is a idiots outlook.
---
(Shh, you didn't see anything, I meant mace)
---
I dunno how anyone can take Greatsword seriously. The animations on 2 and 5 are the dumbest shit I've ever seen lol.
---
No no no, it's 350 per class, sex, and race combination, or 30,000 gems for all of them.
---
&gt; 15 327 720 line
---
First of all, that's a pretty unoptimized way of doing things, but let's say you're right.
---
That sounds like a lot if you're unfamiliar with the size of most production databases but is hardly anything in this era. If you were to rent cloud servers just for that it would only cost $5-10 a month.
---
No one cares if the system is good for you. It's not a good system overall.
---
Was implemented in Guild Wars 1 from the start with no aditional charge and with unlimited templates, now not only they are limited, they cost a lot.
---
&gt; that's cuz people don't understand the difference between a third party program that can eat your items and it's fine
---
Oh yeah, I know dozens of folk who had their items eaten by arc dps.
---
as someone who did this (Started at level 0) recently, I would say revenant is a bad choice for a fresh character. It took me just under 24 hours to complete utilizing several tools to do it. If you start at level 80 it cuts it down to about 18 hours for completely fresh. Speed things up a lot further and unlock the Herald elite spec in wvw - 189 Tyrian Hero points and 7 PoF/HoT hero points. This will drop the time further down to the 10-12 hour area.
---
Removing the banner for the time being would've been ok if they actually would've fixed the pose and the size issue later on, you know, so they wouldn't lure in more people with false advertising. This is literally doubling down on it though, instead of fixing it. 
---
I don't know why Anet thinks they can pull all this shit recently but I sincerely hope it backfires.
---
I prefer games with a subscription fee because they actually pump out content instead of cash shop items. GW2 is approaching phone game levels of not caring about the game and just trying to incentivize people to spend on the cash shop.
---
Someone sue.
---
Yeah I love how people talk as if the entire hardcore scene of this game *isn't* dying. It is, and has been for a while. Anyone who raids can tell you that.
---
And as is often the case the most vocal individuals are also a very small minority and they also expect the ENTIRE GAME to cater to their needs and interests without any consideration for anybody else....nothing new here.

YouTube keeps recommending "let's read an AskReddit post and laugh at the responses" videos to me (even though I've never watched one), so presumably there's money in it. Modern journalism, ladies and gentlemen!
---
If you want to talk about statistical majority then most of their players probably don't have a full set of ascended. The majority of their players won't know/care about this feature at all. I think it's pretty safe to say that this template system wasn't designed for them, but they'll be able to benefit from it if they so choose.
---
If these templates were coming out of nowhere and completely from scratch this entire issue would be seen completely differently. It's a positive! We're getting something for seamless build transitions! However... Arc Templates exist, and have existed, for well over a year. It's an overlay which just uses calls that exist but are hidden within the game. It can't make gear appear in your inventory, it can't delete gear from your inventory. You can create as many builds as you like, save as many builds as you like, and then load as many builds as you like.
---
If you're keeping up with the threads which have already been posted there are many players who simply were not aware there was a third-party solution via arc templates. That's because, yeah, most players are pretty casual and don't have that need / search to fulfill that desire. But ANet knows of its existence and even gave it permission to be used until they create a first party solution. Their solution feels like anti-QoL *and* comes with a price tag.
---
So if this isn't going to be used by the majority of their players (casual) and doesn't do enough for the ones who would use it the most (hardcore), why was it even made? 
---
Not everything a company does will be catered to their majority audience. Some things are made for prestige / appeal to the hardcore audience with the plan to draw more players in over time and giving the casual players something to aim at beyond level cap. Raids in MMORPGs are the pinnacle of this design philosophy and there's a pretty great thread from last year about FFXIV on the matter:
---
[Regional clear rates and the raiding experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/8nk8ih/open_thread_regional_clear_rates_and_the_raiding/) (which pulls its data from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/8ksd7y/luckybancho_lodestone_scans_may_2018active/)). What they did was use an unlocked item only obtained from clearing a raid to gauge raid activity across regions. In NA/EU the raid clear rates were at about 3% whereas Japan was 13% of all active players. It's a lot of content being made for not a lot of players.
---
I think build templates were meant to be geared more toward that casualcore/hardcore player who has invested enough of themselves into the game to learn and master different professions, game modes, and roles. I feel as if they woefully missed the mark on the expectations the community had *and* are offering an inferior option to what existed via a third-party they had permitted to fill this need.
---
Two years ago, I did not consider it feasible to run multiple builds on a single character. Back then I was still learning and mastering new content for the first time so it wasn't a problem for me.
---
I started using build templates when I finished my first set of legendary armor, and the entire game changed. Since then (since I've now largely mastered the content), the main motivation and goal structure behind me playing the game revolves around having new ways to play my characters. This means acquiring new gear sets to play new builds and experience the same old content I've cleared a thousand times in a different way.
---
Excuse me for finding a way to enjoy a game that releases endgame content at a snail's pace.
---
And I would also comment that the modern meta is *significantly* more varied than it was two years ago. PoF specs are properly integrated into the meta, we actually have comps that aren't Chrono/Druid, and every single class has multiple relevant dps options. It wasn't anywhere near as big a problem during HoT because most classes could really only do one thing. PoF gave us so much more to manage both with having access to a second set of elite specs and with the subsequent balance changes that made more comps viable.
---
&gt;The purpose of the system was to serve as an incentive for experimentation, making you play other builds and other characters, but that's not going to happen.
---
No, that was the purpose of Arcdps's build templates. The purpose of Anet's is to give you another reason to bust out your wallet and give them more money.
---
I'm just speculating as to why they'd have to do a client update for the TP, when something isn't being added to the game.
---
Build Templates is unfair! Arena Net is in there, standing at the concession, plotting﻿ our oppression.
---
Some people just get a kick out of min-maxing stuff. No need to overthink this.
---
This is such a weird argument.  You're saying somehow the developers of the game can't come up with a more efficient and better system than a third-party developed tool.
---
If ArcDPS is such a "damn hack", surely the games developers should be able to replicate its functionality.
---
They store everything locally so it doesnt eat up bandwidth
---
Did people think guild wars 2 was a nonprofit business or charity? Lol have realistic expectations.
---
Look at raids.  Isn't it literally only a single digit percent of the population that has even done a raid by Anet's own numbers and yet they keep making raids but abandoned dungeons that pretty much everyone ran?
---
I saw a post of a person insisting they had over 10 builds on a single character that they NEEDED including a build for jumping puzzles and being in the city and acting like that was remotely reasonable.
---
I have quite a lot of raiding exp and have done done 2 sloth ignore mechanics runs. That being said, heal scourge is a crutch for new team comps and really starts to diminish value in most raids. Its only meta in a few raids where there is high environmental damage (soulless, xera, ect). Now scourge is also going to be irrelevant in Matthias and sloth since  movement is going to make you irrelevant.
---
The Arc templates argument isn't a reasonable one.
---
It automated clicks which isn't allowed.  ANet ONLY allowed it temporarily until they had their own option.  That's not assumption, we all knew that was their official stance.
---
But isn't this feature specifically for a minority of players? It only seems logical to expect complaints if a feature misses the expectations of its target audience. I don't think it's about the ENTIRE game catering to a small group of people. It's about something that has been request for a very long time not living up to expectations and being combined with another monitization scheme.
---
The problem with this is that ~~ANet~~ no developer can build out features to fit what every user wants to do, especially since there are *always* users who want to use a feature/product/system in ways it wasn't intended to be.
---
The impression I get from the back and forth is that those hardcore players want the ability to have each "build" templated, even if only 1-2 things are changed, while ANet seems to have intended it more for drastic build/gear changes. To be honest, those drastic changes are all I ever used GW1 and GW2 Arc templates for. I never though that a single trait/skill/weapon change needed a templating system.
---
Perspective here matters, no matter what, no one will ever account/know what every player wants.
---
This is an amazing update! Thank you so much for your work!
---
I miss when ArenaNet sold content and people were excited to support content.
---
Calm down, Spongebob.
---
That's bs, I haven't seen or been asked for LI in the three weeks since I came back to the game, all people ask for is KP sometimes, and I often see training raids/no requirement raids
---
My point exactly, nobody.

awesomeness for a pittance

Taking away or devaluing carrots that dangle in front of all players might affect hardcore players more directly as they are the ones going for them (legendary gear) but it also reduces the incentive for "casual" to invest more time into the game and possibly swap to "hardcore".
---
With no gear progression, GW2 is already starved for meaningful rewards in endgame content and I'd argue that Anet has to be careful because many players are reward-driven.
---
Hardcore players might be a minority but some can be rather healthy for the game, think about those commanders tagging up in WvW but also HP or bounty trains in HoT/PoF areas. Quite a few of these have specialized (mesmer) builds to port people who fall behind, taking the example of HP runs. Basically, the game might be better off incentivising more players to become more hardcore.
---
How they didn’t see this coming is beyond me. How some people didn’t see this change coming is also beyond me.
---
Make your own squad.
---
I don't think you're alone in this sentiment, no, I too used to have a few, around 7 or 8, maybe little more different builds and that was on a single character, back when I used arc. Then I slowly started to realize just how actually useless and meaningless most of them were because aside from WvW, any raid or fractal build would work just as well on open world, you don't need a freaking template to swap a trait or a skill ffs, that's just pushing yourself to try as hard as you can to pretend there's actually a choice in builds in this game. And PvP I doubt people end up swapping builds every single game, its not like you're fighting the same people over and over again.
---
That said, I don't have any problem with them selling the gear templates because of the way they made it to work as 18 slots inventory bags, I think that's a really neat and interesting take on those. But I do think its really out of touch to sell a glorified notepad for the build templates and it makes no sense to sell those, they should've separated them to let us have the build templates stored on our computers locally. 
---
Regarding the cap. They actually said during the stream that the cap of 6 slots per character and a 24 cap on the storage of builds is like that because its really scary to go over the cap as it could break things they don't actually expect to break. With that I think we're facing a situation similar to shared inventory slots where at launch we just could have 5 slots and that got expanded to up to 22 slots over time, so that could mean we may be able to get an expansion to the cap in the future.
---
One of the benefits of legendary gear is that it only takes 1 inventory slot. Because the equipment templates will be priced with the included inventory slots in mind, it is meaningful that the legendary gear will be taking up a slot in each template it gets put in.
---
It's more that, in regular inventory, a legendary thing has all the options at the cost of one inventory slot. In a template slot, it only has one option, the same as ascended gear.
---
I'm pretty sure this is caused by technical back-end stuff, and I'm not sure how they would fix it, but I get that it's a problem.
---
Wow. Are you going to start telling us theories about what would happen if Batman and Robin had a child?
---
You dont know what would be possible, or not. I dont know either. All we know is that some random without access to UI, nor anything else that isnt shipped with the game itself, managed to work out a way to swap Templates without Issues, which also promoted the usage of Legendaries.
---
Anets version puts a rotten pie on everyone's face who crafted Legendaries, limits the number of Templates and sells it to us as what we wanted for 6 years.
---
If Arc would have been "inherently unstable" noone would cry out in frustration about a new Template system.
---
&gt;Make your own squad.
---
Nah I think I’ll just let raiding die by continuing not to participate, with the rest of the community.
---
Queue curb your enthusiasm music.
---
I miss when anet made content worth selling.
---
At this point, Arenanet need to step back and look at Necromancer as a whole. They are so bipolar when it comes to this class, they need to even try to figure out what they want it to be.
---
&gt;Unironically it's probably best to shrink that 30+ down to a smaller set of suboptimal builds that are good for all encounters
---
In many scenarios you might be able to just load a close-enough template and then switch the one trait that needs fixing
---
One of the comments. How sad. Isn't the whole point of build templates to avoid this type of thing? What a fucking disaster.
---
PVP reapers like it, but no one else can take it due to the lack of offensive traits in the line.  There was a possibility scourge could use it, but they gutted scourge, so that point is moot. It still doesn't fix any of PVP reaper's problems, so at best its a slight upgrade. You also give up all the vampric effects, so you often end up with a HP pool thats durable, but hard to replenish.
---
&gt;"change all equipped legendary items stats"
---
they actually did. Change a legendary stat, there's a tick box to change all.
---
I miss when anet made content
---
orange man bad
---
Spam
---
tbh legendary armours look like shit
---
It's a little mind boggling to me either.  Like... the build templates I'll end up using in the long term to a degree on, say... my thief as an example (my main class).  I run different open world, wvw, deadeye, daredevil, etc. builds all over to a point where I'll probably have to save some of the linked codes to a notepad.  On the other hand... all of those different BUILDS only use two sets of armor and weapons.  One set is full zerk ascended with 5/9 infusions, and the other is full Viper ascended with 5/9 infusions.  At a stretch I could probably justify a third gear set for WvW and run marauder or something but tbh, I don't and don't feel a need to.  It baffles me that someone would need 8 FULL equipment sets for a single class... even mesmer.  If it's a piece or two of gear swapped out to get extra toughness, why bother making a full template rather than just... swapping two pieces of equipment?
---
The only way to get up there is by using a skyscale. If you don't play the story far enough, you can't get there and it would be bad design to gate map completion behind story.
---
Cold at least fix the pose tho
---
Almost every fail on xera i've ever seen has been due to shard problems (ok, thats a lie, i saw one group fail to 4 ppl failing to glide correctly). Especially around teleport times, the barrier is invaluable to keep ppl from going down (especially since i've seen ppl get res bugged under center platform all the time).

---
2018 Laughs in free arc dps build templates. 
---
2019 Cries in ToS breaking arc dps build templates and potentially having to spend $5-$60 on build templates (let's say $25). Truly expansion level content with expansion level prices.
---
If you're going to talk about meta, there are no shard problems. Shard clearing is a not a meta strat.
---
Many have
---
I partially get it. When you have access to the game's source code, making changes to equipment through back-end code can't destroy equipment because those are two different inputs made by the client to the servers. You're literally saying "equip" instead of "destroy"
---
Not to mention that to destroy an item, the servers require further confirmation which would never be sent via a build templates command
---
If even after all that the devs are still afraid, they could literally make equipment in the separated inventory slots indestructible (the ones used in the build templates feature)
---
Literally everything you just said was wrong
---
My favorite was when there was a WvW season and my college roommate and I would run zergs for hours in EotM to unlock achievements. My old roommate has since passed away and every time I run in WvW I think about him. RIP Mike
---
Personally, I'm one of those players who's  got an account value over 300k gold.  If I liquidated everything, including salvaging all my gear and selling off all my bags and other things on my characters, I'd have 8k gold.  I've also already spent real money on character slots and bag slots to store all my stuff for ArcDPS templates.  I've built multiple 32 slot bags to safely store several sets of weapons and armor in, yet you think it's okay for ANet to charge someone like me, who's spent money on both character and bag slots, more for something that already basically exists as a 3rd party solution?
---
When people were actually excited for things in this game.
---
Long story short. People are shit at the game but want to think that they're actually good or elite.
---
In a mediocre group you can see a power reaper outdpsing "meta" classes, it's hilarious. They just want to think they're good by taking full meta and then wiping because they can't survive. Big meme. 
---
Played properly, meta classes are most of the time better for clearing fast, skipping mechanics, low manning (lol Adina) etc etc. Though since when does the "average raider" actually play well. Its a long standing meme^(actuallyrealitytholmao) that the hardest part about raids are finding competent people to raid with.
---
You mean other than the half year epi bouncing dominated almost every boss in the game, and scourge was so strong it took up 7/10 slots in raids?
---
&gt; The persons till got to keep the skin anyways.
---
That seems like a gift, but it's really because the customer support aren't being given the tools to relock items in the wardrobe.
---
So when it comes to purchases like multi-skin mount bundles, you're SOL for refunds. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
They actually even helped me out with buyers remorse and no fault of their own. I got infinite gathering tools, then a couple days later UB tools went on sale and they not only refunded me the difference or the sale, but swapped my tools out for the UB version. 10/10 would waste hard earned money on digital trash again.
---
&gt; "But I need assassins stats over berserker for this raid encounter or it's literally game-breaking for me!"
---

---
&gt; It's a simple l2p issue.
---
this is the dumbest thing i've ever read, you telling people to l2p because what exactly? you're able to get carried by using inferior build setups? congrats. very impressive.
---
“Really low drop rate” does not make something prestigious. It’s like saying that people who win the lottery are prestigious.
---
It isn’t like you get it by doing CM of fractals or Raids. You just have to do 4  easy events over a few hours or buy keys once a day and get lucky.
---

---
&gt;Who gives a fuck about raids in a game that sees so much success despite basically going against the grain.
---
Because they advertised their game as something for everyone.
---
Despite this fact 99% of this game can be played by running around mindlessly spamming your primary skill. It's all an open world cluster fuck with no skill or commitment. Hell even the entire reward system has no prestiege or show of effort/skill because it all comes down "Hope you got that gold"...which you can just farm anywhere in equally mindless content.
---
People ask for this shit because people arent happy with a game that caters to someone who plays for 20 minutes a day and thinks "Oh my god these story instances are hours of content". 
---
&gt;You think that until you consider that even buy to play + subscription MMOs like WoW and FFXIV also have their own cash shops with their own outrageous offerings for their own high prices. 
---
You clearly don't play either of these games so stop talking out of your ass. 
---
WoW's cash shop is a slow trickle of an occasional cosmetic mount or pet. This is at about 1/10th the rate anything Anet puts out. While also putting out 50x that in game. Please inform me how many cool mount skins and fancy toys i can get in game in GW2...oh right none of them. While also not locking any QoL and core game features behind a cash shop.
---
XIV is worse off by putting out cash shop content more and removing holiday content to sell it back. Yet they STILL dont manage to be as egregious as GW2 nickle and diming every last god damn thing they can. 
---
&gt;But they also engage in similar cash shop practices. They have the funds to waste on bullshit nobody wants to do.
---
People do want to do the content. Hell people want to do the raids in GW2 if you had half a fucking brain to pay attention to it. People have been clamouring for a story mode since they came out because they are cool places and designs and stories that ARE worth the development time. Difficulty modes are not difficult to make they are not bottle necks to dev time.
---
Hell you claim the WoW/XIV devs "waste time on shit nobody wants". Yep thats why raid participation in both  games is up to over 70% of the player base because they actually cater to every skill level. Turns out people want to do shit. 
---
&gt;You want to be raid gatekeepers? Well that’s fine, the rest of the community will just laugh at you for killing your own preferred game mode. Congratulations.
---
Congratulations on being that condescending cunt you are mocking. You're doing the same thing by telling people who actually want a fucking challenge to go play other games. To stay away from your game where you just get to experience the world and that's what its all about.
---
The 24 limit was described in the stream as being because when they put the number higher things got unstable. They didn't go into more detail than that, but it sounds like it was doing more than just losing items for some reason. I can't think of a data reason for this, but I can't see their code.
---
Because there is nothing else in the game that is client-side other than your video settings, I think making this one thing client side would be a really bad move. As you mentioned, people who get a new computer without knowing, or who switch computers frequently would get frustrated or just not use the feature. How would you effectively communicate that in-game without having a tacky warning all over the template screen? I play at work and at home and don't want to have to transfer a config file back and forth, so this is my argument. I've done it before with save games, but I really didn't like it.
---
If they continue along this particular monetization path, there is a good likelyhood the serious raiders use an unauthorized tool to give them this behavior.
---
I was reading some recent [guildwars2.com](https://guildwars2.com) forum posts, one includes a poll posted by a player, asking other players how many templates they would use, only \~26% of the players responding to the poll claimed to want more than 6 equipment tabs. MOST fall into the 2-4 category.
---
HUH? if you get stuck on warhorn in wvw youre actually screwing over your group. and pvp theres literally no reason to bring it.
---
It's certainly not showing.
---
I'm a veteran player, they aren't asking anything from me here. They're offering a new feature to players. They are providing plenty of free build slots for most players. For those that want to get more, they give the option to buy more, just as people had to buy new character slots if they wanted more characters, new bank slots if they wanted more bank space, more material storage if they wanted to store more mats, etc. This has always been their business model, and a veteran player would know that.
---
By benchmark standards necro's classes have lower DPS than other DPS classes and have one of the easier dps rotations however, as a result there's also a bit of stigma of laziness. This is compounded by the minion master builds (which are terrible). A good reaper will out dps a mediocre other class. You should play comfort and let your numbers speak for themselves. However, when communicating, you should also be referring to classes by elite spec's. If you reply with "necro" and all we see is the base class's icon, there's a chance that people will take you seriously as "you're raiding on a necro". 
---
Reaper in specific does have utility but it's often overshadowed or not considered. 
---
Necro, reaper hate also started a long time ago because condi spec was their only good spec before ANET finally started getting the balance right for Reaper as a power spec. During that time, it was low dps and very brain dead. In fractals especially you'd see stacking condi reaper comps because they were "safe" for fractals. However, they were so incredibly slow and most people even though the build is "easy" to pull off, were so incredibly bad that the moment you saw a multi necro group you immediately thought to avoid them.
---
The moment from the end of season 3 to the beginning of season 4 was cookoo bananas. Elona leaks, mount leaks, season 3 ending, then the expansion announcement just two months before it launched, then immediately into season 4 with no break. It was bonkers.
---
Here's the thing, though. They don't have to get paid by monetizing the thing they worked on. They spend a lot of their resources making the living story, which is... oh right, free. They recoup their costs via other transactions. They can, and arguably *should*, be doing the same for such a crucial feature like this.
---
I stated my opinion that client side is not okay for me, and is not in line with anything else in the game.
---
I dont have a link, but theyve stated repeatedly that they cant remove unlocks. The easiest way to find a source would probably be to look at one of the threads where somebody accidently account bound their legendary.
---
Not sure what you are talking about. The article says ppl want templates like in GW1. Then it references a redditor who talks about the equipment template tabs in GW2. Yet GW1 only had equipment templates in pvp. Skill templates were in both pvp and pve.
---
FFXIV game engine is terrible.
---
At least GW2 can deal with large amounts of players properly.
---
Shadowbringers maps are also heavier and a lot of people are having issues with FPS as well.
---
And leta not even mention the UI: they've reach the point they need to remove stuff just so they can add new. Its completely cluttered in spaguetti code.
---
My response was mostly aimed at correcting 24 slots as a technical limitation where it is not known that such a limitation exists.
---
I made my stance on client side saves clear at the end of my post.

The intention was to let your response on the first part stand as it is without dispute, not to neglect it.
---
Speaking as a multi classer: I think a lot of people are over exaggerating how many build and gear templates they ACTUALLY need. But there IS a statement that there aren't enough gear templates given that there are three vastly different modes in the game. 
---
Lets take for example **Mesmer**, not chrono, but **MESMER** as a base. They can be spec'd **in pve alone** as 
---
1. power boon chrono
---
2. minstrel chrono
---
3. condi boon chrono
---
4. dps power chrono
---
5. dps condi chrono
---
6. condi mirage
---
Now, as far as traits and skills go I'd argue you don't NEED a trait template for those outside of pure convenience. I don't find it difficult to be in hero pane to swap to the correct traits and skills but I may be in a minority of people who actually read and know what each trait does instead of blindly copying traits. (In fact with shareable trait templating, I fear even worse that people will take a set of traits and not adapt or read it and understand why/how it works)
---
However, this is still with respects to **pve alone** in Raids. There's no build for open world, there's no pvp build, there's no WvW builds. 
---
The most recent update: 
---
 Added a checkbox to the Customize window for equipped items to apply the currently displayed stats and legendary rune choices to all valid items. 
---
Is ACTUALLY a HUGE QoL improvement for legendary gear and personally with 6 legendary armors, I'll be using this more than gear templates with gear templates being used for mode specific rather than a spec/build specific.

I am not telling anyone how to do anything. Nowhere did I say that I think everyone should play the same way. Or even my way. In fact, I specifically said the opposite.
---
I am expressing the view that expecting ANet to provide, *for free*, the maximum number of slots that people think they might need is unreasonable. And judging by the above *some* people feel they need rather a lot.
---
It is ANet's right as a business to retail whatever product they wish. People will buy that product or they won't. It is really as simple as that. It is possible in a game as old as GW2 that there are some technical limitations to content like this that we aren't privy to. I just feel calling them out and making it sounds as if they have done the wrong thing is a little precious. By all accounts this has been something the community has wanted for a long time and now they are sinking the boot in.

Sounds unreasonable to me.

---
All the other information shows that most people will have some unknown amount of shards because "most" can be defined as the number of people that will fall in the center of the bell curve. Why do you continue to reject that conclusion and insist you somehow know how many shards most people have when you don't have access to that data?
---
I recently finished skyscale.
---
I found the scavenger hunt the most tideous and boring.
---
The last step of flying around was also really dumb. They could have actually put some mini flight lessons in there or just left it out.
---
TBH for me the 250 grind was not too bad, from playing I had about 100 of everything (except mistonium because I spent it on requiem set..).
---
The currency grind I liked because it took me to all the maps. If 9 toons it really wasn't bad, got all to 250 in 3 days time. Mistonium was also not bad if you did 3 purple bubbles and the 1 heart, 20 per day per character (9 chars in 180 a day...)
---
killing dhuum cm with the friends I had been playing with for years.  The fact that I was the guild leader who pushed us to get it was also gratifying.
---
Playing gw prophecies back in the day at launch and the feeling of everything being new for everyone. Doing missions that were all heavily populated. Fun times.
---
I honestly think a lfg panel takes lot of the charm out of mmo's. I miss spamming chat "lfg lvl 20 warrior  with full droknars armor for mission + bonus". It was forced chat interaction that made these games feel far more alive with community imo.
---
Also some jp was cool, since I would have never even known about them otherwise (not my interest). Favorite was the asura one which took me a while
---
&gt;I sincerely hope it backfires

Careful what you wish for. As a WvW player I always used to say "I can't wait until this game dies and Anet goes out of business"  [then this happened...](https://kotaku.com/guild-wars-2-developer-arenanet-plans-for-mass-layoffs-1832799804)

It's been reiterated multiple times that change to dx11 or 12 wouldn't bring a huge difference when the game is insanely bottlenecked by the single core cpu performance.

But I agree with you, I hope that they won't go full Bethesda with the new projects and won't reuse the same ancient engine.
---
But dont technically you need more xp per level?

like mount licenses did?

yeah, don't kid ourselves, in a week this will be forgotten.

Except it's not really automated clicks.
---
&gt; I am expressing the view that expecting ANet to provide, for free, the maximum number of slots that people think they might need is unreasonable. And judging by the above some people feel they need rather a lot.
---
The actual reasonable feedback on this issue including the OP is not that the max no. of slots should be provided free.
---
&gt; t is ANet's right as a business to retail whatever product they wish.
---
And it is our rights as consumers to provide feedback as to whether we consider it fair or not.
---
I mean, let's be honest, this feature *is* for the minority. Do you honestly think most casual players have a use for this?
---
&gt;However, let's think a little long term here.
---
Maybe Anet isn't thinking long term anymore.  Maybe they are trying to milk us at the end of the games life.  I'll say this, I definitely don't intend to buy any build templates until the next raid wing is released or wvw gets its big update.
---
Then that should be optional, not mandatory.
---
Can you give me a working link?
---
Leveling my Warrior alongside my wife's Guardian.
---
I don't know what their data storage solution is. It's something that handles quickly moving your data between N ad-hoc servers spun up on demand. Maybe the build templates had to be stored as values on an item in a section of "the armory"? I can't know that.
---
The build templates can be shared as text out of game. There is nothing stopping someone from building a tool for managing your build templates on your computer. It should be trivial to build something that can save and load them for you, probably in just a few clicks. If you want the tool to also show build details, that would take longer. If they actually take down arcdps, I'll personally probably persue getting an open source tool for this made even though I probably wouldn't use it. 
---
I can agree that the hardcore players are better off with arcdps than this system. I don't know why they made this system when it has to be this restricted, but I have a guess. I'm thinking they may be worried about what happens if the guy running arcdps stops. If he stops updating, even for a few months, the whole tool is gone for that whole time unless he can hand it off first. Anet building their own tool means that disaster can't happen, and the life of raids is in their hands, not someone else's.
---
It is sad, really. A chair for your charr - well, no. FU.
---
I believe they showed it as a copy/pasteable text you can get and share in and out of the game. If arcdps actually gets shut down, I can guarantee you someone will make a build template manager app.
---
A few for me:
---
* First time playing AB meta. 
---
* First few world bosses.
---
* Finishing the core tyria story.
---
Keep in mind the cost for a single account slot, and that they consider equipment templates to have between 12 and 60 slots.
---
Initially when I read " and the life of raids is in their hands, not someone else's. " and thought it a bit much, but then I took a moment to consider it...
---
Whenever ArcTemplates is down, Raiding reallly REALLY suffers.
---
This is the nail in the coffin for me. Been waiting for this for years and they go and pull this. Time to move on too new pastures.
---
Sometimes when I lag I get stuck in one place for a few seconds and then have a huge movement boost that can last for quite a while.
---
Skills like mistform also appear longer (at least on my screen), even 10 seconds longer.
---
I found the luminescent armor sets quite great. Need quite a lot of SW farming though.
---
The laugh I just let out 😭
---
So Deltaconnected the individual that makes ArcDPS and ArcTemplates WILL disable ArcTemplates on the 29th, this has already been confirmed by Deltaconnected themselves when they stated (paraphrasing) "The agreement with arenanet was ArcDPS and ArcTemplates will be allowed only as long as Arenanet doesn't implement these features".
---
Also, The actual Developer Amy only said "There are currently 24 that you can buy", the other person who is NOT a developer Rubi Bayer is a Social Media Coordinator. Rubi Bayer is the one that said "scary code" NOT Amy.
---
Never had any issue using them for approximately 1/2 a year, not even when using outdated versions to swap builds. I think issues only happen if your bags are full and you try to swap.
---
Maaybe not in a zerg but it works quite well for roaming &amp; picking targets off quickly if you use voice chat to coordinate with the others in a group.
---
All the condi clear &amp; barrier is just a bonus.
---
As someone who is probably a casual, I intend to use it to switch between my viper and minstrel gear on my main. As for the build specs, I will mostly use that to switch between my solo open world build and my fractal build. Maybe I'll also work in a CC build and a mobility build. Now that I think about it, I may also want an AoE focused open world build, or a turret aggro drawing cheese build. Probably wont do all of them, but they are all ideas I have.
---
Leveling to 80 in 2014 while I was 14 years old. Reminds me of better times.
---
Only $60? That's a steal
---
Playing hide-and-go-seek with Aurene and my daughter.
---
It's exactly as u/CommanderArenaOne already said.
---
What you read about sharing legendary gear was merely a suggestion to improve the Build Templates to not make Legendary Armor suck. (Because as it stands now, with shared legendary armor across some toons you benefit the least from the new equipment templates as in 'not at all and it's a big downgrade from arcdps buildtemplates‘.)
---
Please give us gear blueprints ANet, not just gear loadouts :(
---
Isn’t it the opposite of being anti-consumer though? They realized people weren’t happy with something they bought directly for money and that they were falsely advertising. 
---
They patched it quick *for* the customers to not spend money.
---
It doesn't include all the features.  That's a demo.  They give out free transmute stones, but they're still sold on the gemstore.  They're not technically free.
---
Weird that Arcdps can do that.
---
I'm a dev too (full stack web dev, since it flavors my speculation here), and I agree it's hard to see what would cause it, but that interaction felt familiar.
---
I'm guessing there is somehow a situation where they couldn't just... You know... Add a fucking table and have each template stored in a row. Maybe it's related to the way they move characters onto shards or something that's restricting data or data formats. If that's the case, maybe they had to hack this template data in as attachments to items in the armory... I have no idea, but I'm sure we both agree that some code can get really weird problems sometimes.
---
You mean like the wardrobe? Add an ítem to the
---
 storage and use it as many times as you want... Why cant we get that?
---
Arcdps doesn't have to work within the limitations of a large pre-existing system. It can just read the text and make something new for storing it.
---
If you know about it, you can use dropbox or something to sync them up. But yes, the "I reinstalled windows and now all my templates are gone, WTF ANet" would be weighing into this.
---
Thing is, the demand for build templates has always been loudest in the high-end communities of raiding, fractals, wvw, pvp. So if they are pricing them and marketing them to the casual playerbase, as you claim, then they are actively extorting the high-end community, and or forcing them out of the game with the insane price demand.  
---
  
---
And it's not the DPS players that will be hit hardest, either. DPS players typically swap characters, rather than builds. It's the support players who usually juggle far more builds on a single toon. Support players are usually the anchors of organized content. They are usually the leaders, the organizers, the glue that holds these things together.  
---
I always knew they were going to monetize build templates so it came as no surprise to me. What pisses me off the most is not the monetization or even the stupid cost. It's the fact that I spent thousands of gold on legendary equipment for the express purpose of managing my builds easier and saving bag space only for anet to take a steaming dump all over that progress with the way legendary armour factors into gear templates.  
---
Fuck knows what the point in legendary armour is now. Certainly not the aesthetics.
---
The combat system is what got me hooked on GW2 when it launched. I think 2016-2017 was peak GW2 gameplay
---
Fun facts: those like me who use template extensively hate the system, casuals won't use it.
---
Thank god I made the swap to firebrand before this. Scourge is fun till this hard nerf :(
---
I personally love warbeast light set for female human/norn chars https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Warbeast_armor_(light)
---
Hey you finally added something that I have been long requesting.  I think earlier you said it wasn't possible due to something about the API not working with the map?
---
Yes, gear blueprints, PLEASE. [They could even be shareable and would probably work for PvP gear as well!]
---
I can get around the strict limitation of 6/24(or 27?) skill templates with my notepad.
---
But I limited to 6 gear versions per character, even if I fork out a butt load of cash. I can only get around that by forking out more cash, buying character slots (+ leveling up a new toon; ofc this can be circumvented by having a sheer endlees amount of tomes of knowledge).
---
But I can't even share my ascended or hypothetical legendary gear across toons anymore.
---
Now for the rest of the comment, ignore it if you don't care:  
---
How could gear blueprints work and be shareable?
---
- Instead of fixing a certain item to a space, fix the stat combination instead.
---
E.g. "Berserker". 
---
- Store a link to the sigills and runes as a generally available item, not a direct link to an item you have in your inventory.
---
- Infusions or upgrades are the only harder part. Not every gear has infusion or upgrade slots. I'd say they could be ignored and just work with what people have stored in the gear that will in the end be placed in these spaces.
---
Easy pre requisites.
---
Then in the window where you can change your current gear loadout, you get a button 'Load from Blueprint‘.
---
It will then load available pieces from your inventory or armory, selecting the highest possible matching equipment. (So if you have legendary armor, use it. Then Ascended, then exotics lvl 80, ... etc.)
---
It will display a short message if you couldn't fill a slot that would be needed.
---
Aand - you‘re done. Should be comparatively easy to implement!
---
And because the stat combinations get stored, and not the actual items you can share them easily!
---
Store the gear blueprints account wide I guess, so we can get up to 24/27(?) if we pay up.
---
And since they would also be shareable, we could load them from chatlinks as well.
---
Those digital trash are hard works of other people too :(
---
So I had this guild back in Guild Wars 1 who absolutely carried me. These guys were an awesome group that would speed run content daily, while me over in the corner who was afraid to vanquish one map kind of did my own thing, but they were awesome guys and good friends. When Guild Wars 2 was winding up to launch I kind of lost contact with them. I was heading off to college and didn’t really play much Guild Wars until 2 came out, and by the time I came back to 1 nobody had been online for months.
---
I ended up quitting Guild Wars 2 for a while to go play ArcheAge after a year or so of playing, and when I quit that game due to Trion’s shenanigans and came back the guild I was in had dissolved so I was talking to another one of the early commanders I knew from WvW at GW2’s launch and he invited me to his guild at the time. Few days pass and there’s some dude in chat named K*\*\*\* Somethingorother, but it had a similar naming convention to one of the guys from my Guild Wars 1 guild. I was like, no way that’s him but something pushed me to ask anyway so I asked if he played GW1 and he said yes, then I asked if he was in this guild name (guild I was in) and he was like, “DUDE OMG”, so after laughing and confirming it was him and he knew who I was, it turned out like half of my GW1 guild had migrated to the same server in GW2 and just happened to be in this guild run by a guy I’d met in GW2 who had nothing to do with our original guild.
---
The world really is small sometimes.
---
I still think 1k gems is insane. I know GW2 has to make money but I would not pay 1k gems for 1 account-wide slot. I would pay a max of 600 for that. Or just charge 2000 gems to unlock all 6 templates and 6 builds on all characters. That I can get behind.
---
But knowing ANET's past monetization... I'm dreaming.
---
Hello guys. I am potential new player and would like to know about some aspects of the game before i buy expansions. 
---
First of all i like mmo games in general. Played wow till BFA was released. I like both pvp and pve aspects of the game but i am mostly for pve. Progressing though mythic raids, dying, raging, crying, repeating. I love all that. I know basics of GW 2 as i have tried free version. 
---
Eventually, once i know my class well and have enough knowledge about the game i plan to crunch time on pve content. Therefore, i'd like to know if it is worth to start GW2 from zero while having intention to play seriously and get into raiding and other endgame pve activities. And how difficulty of GW 2 raids can be compared to mythic or hc(when hc was still a thing) raids of WOW.
---
I hope it isn't needed. And I am sure many are of the same mindset of making a tool to make up for it.
---
Even if ArcTemplates is discontinued, there is nothing stopping someone from picking up where they left and and implementing their own chainload/hook to something that looks oddly similar...
---
You sound more midcore to me honestly.
---
okay thanks bro
---
I mean, yeah, it amounted to 26% of people that were interested, but specifically also use the offical forums for feedback, and responded to this specific, player-made poll. I'm interested, but haven't seen or responded to this poll. 
---
I'm sure there are many other people that are interested that also discussed it on the internet that haven't responded to this specific forum post. It's obviously not a highly accurate representation of what the community wants.
---
Nah you just need some good old Pym particles and a suit (or those discs ant man throws to change objects sizes on on the movie.) :P
---
Legendary Dyes is something that fits perfectly in this game. I wouldn't be surprised if we see them show up soon.
---
Thanks for the tip. I don't personally have much trouble with mirages. I have builds that are specially used to fight mirages or deal with heavy burst damage. 
---
This is more of what I have seen and heard new players in pvp complaining about. Plus I liked the reference meme a lot so I drew this picture. Å

A long time ago it was rangers that got all the hate
---
Beating the clocktower for the first time.  
---
Among the guild that I'd joined from my time in GW1, there were a few of us that formed a little sub group, and ended up forming our own guild to organize dungeon runs and banners and whatnot.  In that group that I played with through the first year or so, before I took some time off and they all left (rip), there was one who I swear just did jumping puzzles all day.  He'd guide us through them, and we'd run a few every time we were logged in.  I thought it felt great when I finished the one in the eternal battlegrounds for the first time.  When it came to the Clock tower though, damn.  It honestly took me 10+ hours, multiple nights of just grinding it and trying to get to the top. There were times when I probably should have stepped away, or gone back to the Lab (this was when DR was really bad too) but I wanted to beat it.
---
The rush when I finally crashed through the top was something else.  We were all in voice chat most of the time, and it was kind of a joke at that point that I was in the tower, so it felt great to get some congratulations for finishing.  It seems silly now, because I usually finish it 3 or 4 times a round the past year or two.
---
A "demo" in this context refers to creating some kind of video (usually having video + sound) in the form of programs that usually try to not be bigger than a specific size: you have some categories like 32K, 64K to describe the maximum size of the program (much like in box/many martial arts competition).
---
The [wikipedia page for Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) is a fairly interesting summary if you want a bit more details.
---
**Demoscene**
---
The demoscene is an international computer art subculture focused on producing demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audio-visual presentations. The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene productions are shared at festivals known as demoparties, voted on by those who attend, and released online.
---
The demoscene's roots are in the home computer revolution of the late 1970s, and the subsequent advent of software cracking.

They won't, there's money involved and leaving arcdps's templates function will cut into their profits.
---
In reference to the fact you play via two computers, you’re the minority exception that I mentioned. Those that play on multiple computers. As a result, there’s not much to be done. Backing up is your only option. Now, if backing up if you play on multiple, or even have to get a new computer later on, is the cost of unlimited trait/skill builds for free, that’s a VERY small cost compared to what we’re looking at. Back in gw1 days, people just had others ping them the chat code to get the build back, and save it again, or they used a thumb drive to move local files between computers. There was also websites (which I’m sure SC will become a form of, and metabuilds already kinda is) that just hosted chatcodes to builds, and you’d just pull from there if ya needed. However, the problem you’re faced with, is one maybe 90% of the players wouldn’t face... so I can’t put much weight on it when it’d be so we could have no limit, and no monetary cost (at least one trait/skills, since that wouldn’t need to work like a bag), like we have now.
---
As for a way to solve the legendary issue? I didn’t really have one, not unless we get the amulet and ring that we’re missing from a “100% purple” build, which those would save but not “consume”. Which would be a nice reward imo. We are getting the new feature which autoswaps all to the stat you select on one, which helps...but doesn’t solve. Realistically there isn’t a fix...not unless they want to add more QoL to legendary, or change their stance on gear templates.
---
I have 11 or 12 sets of armor for my Mesmer, so that's 11-12 builds right there. And then different trait and utility skill setups based on what boss, what fractal (also accounting for instabilities), and such that I'm currently doing. Swapping offhands, trinkets, foods, skills, and traits all the time is a chore, and an easy way to walk into a boss fight with the wrong stuff equipped.
---
This offers nothing to the discussion. 
---
ToS compliant Arcdps, was allowed to be used. Build templates were deemed acceptable, and therefor not ToS breaking. Since that’s from the devs themselves, what you say otherwise doesn’t have weight in it.
---
There's been substantial additional information added to the [Mumblelink](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=API%3AMumbleLink&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=1950643&amp;oldid=1709506) by arenanet to enable this. I think BoyC coded this in two nights.
---
&gt; and either unlock more builds
---
That's the point, we can't. Not even with buying all the possible slots. Your argument is moot.
---
Btw is there an attribute to set the marker to be visible only on map/minimap?
---
Can anyone post how the banner looks now?
---
theyre old placeholders for events or something, theyre meant to be removed during development and release, but a few still remain around tyria
---
Yeah, but it's something that has been wanted for a while.  I'm not sure if its something that anet had planned for a while, or if it was something between boyc and myself that triggered it into motion (not sure if he forwarded it to them as a request)..
---
I really hate dealing with addons so the more of these functions they can build into the game the better. I am not currently using any build/gear templates so this is a QoL improvement for me, but maybe not for you. They do have a right to make money from their game and it is hardly pay to win.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
---
Let me just start off by saying I haven't raided in WoW so I can't really say for sure. That being said though, the 10 man raid content and the 5 man fractal content is all pretty great. They both have challenge modes that change up the fights a little bit (some a lot more than others) but the raid ones are all designed to be a one to challenge right now so they unfortunately don't have any repeatable rewards. Fractals have CM 99 and 100 that change up the encounters and massively up the difficulty but top tier groups are able to handle them fine. Learning your build, the fight, and mechanics is very challenging for new players and groups spent a lot of time progressing to some boss kills (wing 5 specifically has 2 of the harder bosses). I'd say that the game is very much worth your [$20](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807) for the full game and both expansions, that means access to all 7 current raid wings. 
---
So again, I think you'll find them easier in general but a lot more of the difficulty is placed on player skill, knowing your rotation, the boss, and your team comp. As someone that trains raids and knows some of the best raiders I'd say the investment is more than worth it.
---
Sorry, mumble link only works on windows...
---
How I would implement infusions would be some dumb  recipe that lets you craft them for 500g and will be a basic infusion no frills but if you want to use aura infusion then you mystic forge it again with an aura infusion to make a legendary variant. Downside would be account bound infusions
---
Hoh ho ho ho ho
---
This is probably the funniest update ever lmao
---
&gt;  If it's a piece or two of gear swapped out to get extra toughness, why bother making a full template rather than just... swapping two pieces of equipment?
---
Would work if you only had two/three side builds like that, yeah. When that number comes to 5/10/15, with each one potentially changing pieces of stuff, weapon (for sigil), a few traits, a few skills, ALL different and tailored for specific content/comp ... one can have sympathy for not wanting/being able to retain each of them by heart. We minmax using online  tools (like gw2skills), then register the build, and can access it in one click.
---
What you're thinking of are DPS builds/specs, and that's true, they have less variance. But concerning tanks and supports ...
---
I had been using DM for its nice broad effectivity on my PvE sustain reaper farmer (soloing/duoing champs, events and dungeons in low pop timezones). But now its been turned into a complete joke. Its so bad it makes me wonder if the dev in charge of this change is actually a B L I Z Z A R D S P Y!?
---
Can you name one or two?
---
The font is deliberately as small as possible in order to avoid screen clutter. And yes, shortening the numbers is a good idea :)
---
Fun fact: the small image that represents the Demoscene on wikipedia is from a prod we did in 2004 :)
---
I'm satisfied with Anet's build templates. Maybe your expectations are too high.
---
It’s all possible due to the help of some very friendly devs at Arenanet. They really are cool guys :)
---
so you’d rather screen shot the hours than the gold to gem receipts or just your gold period. lol, OKkkkkkKkkkKk
---
If I look at this list there is maybe 1 configuration that could be merged with the other it's "raid DPS chrono" and "open world DPS chrono" because it's not too much of an issue (for me) to not be correctly set up for general open world because there is not much threat there.
---
However all the other 7 configurations are very different from one another and assuming OP does a raid full clear and some WvW every week with a Mesmer they have a very high chance to be used every week. And all of these configuration are not even on the "min-maxing" side of things (like having a configuration for 50% boon duration, another for 75%, another for 30%, etc, etc): they are all very functionally different and will most probably not have a lot of gear overlap (maybe some for the Mirage and Chrono WvW roaming build if both are condi or power).
---
I don't think you "don't understand the game" it's more that you have not been playing the game for long enough, took a direction similar to OP and dedicated the same resources in your account/characters yet to be able to relate to this situation.
---
The more you diversify what you do in game and get used to the game and your classes the more you can end up seeing what OP is talking about. The biggest point here could be to notice that playing more than 1 game mode can require you some additional flexibility. And each game mode will have different sub-modes that could require you additional configurations that are still functionally different.
---
In PvE some classes can be played as Power DPS, Offensive Support, Condi DPS, Healer if you take raids, fractals and big meta events (not really gonna try to talk about general open world even if a more dedicated build can usually work waaaay better than your default DPS raid build). In WvW some classes can roam with a Condi Build or a Power Build, but in WvW you also have zergs and some classes can play as Healers, DPS or Offensive Utility (builds more focused on boon rip but still capable on doing some damage for example). All those situations have a very good chance to require gear that is functionally very different from situations even if some overlap can occur for some classes.
---
I hope my explanation could help you to see where the OP of your quote is coming from and why they are probably not really pulling this out of nowhere and that the hard limit really is a limitation in what they can do (even more when swapping gear/traits/skills automatically overwrites the current equipped template so you would have no way to try and be able to access again your "default" state for any given build/gear template if you don't reset it yourself manually).
---
Yeah, I think atm programs like gw2hook that allow them to not apply gfx filters onto the UI is cuz it actually hooks onto the process and makes adjustments, while taco just reads the api.
---
Hopefully it's something they get to in time.  I'm assuming the hiding of the icons when the large map is open is due to an API addition as well?
---
The players upset about this are not desirable.
---
Yeah mumble now tells me when the world map is open.
---
You do understand that even with only two gear templates, you're still free to mix and match them however you like to theorycraft. You aren't permanently locked into the first builds you set. You might just one to set one "casual play" build, and then just use the other one to try out new ideas.
---
Its definately more usable than ever before, but dunno if i would sacrifice my other weapon sets for it, most large groups have better healers already and need warriors mainly as frontline teeth.
---
I can make this go away easily, the root cause however is unknown. I'll put it in the hotfix.
---
Merchants don't have an aquabreather, obviously.
---
WOW you'r so cool
---
Because maybe half those players pick up a few extra slots here and there, and those would add up.
---
It’s a bit more complicated than that because TacO uses prerendered fonts and doesn’t have the ability in itself to change the size of a font. I’ll put it on the todo to be able to select from the available fonts.
---
Reinstall the game?
---
No idea, it’s a game client side feature.
---
It is funny that many vets in ESO I know (anectodal evidence!) will totally disagree with you. Last two patches were complete mess, no proper endgame balancing, crown store... Yadda-yadda, you know the drill.
---
I guess one just has to switch games so often, so they don't get burnt out.
---
90% of all necros are crap af. They roll their facetank minion master build till endgame and now want to play with the big bois.
---
If you are one of the rare good necro player you need to make a name for yourself first. In pugs most of the time it's easier to kick necros instant than waste one pull to see they are crap.
---
Easiest solution: don't pug
---
I have a problem with the last patch, all is working except for the target dps. Arc is showing properly cleave damage but the target dps is stuck at 0/s. (in both area stats and personal stats) u/deltaconnected any idea on how i can solve it? I already tried reinstalling but still same problem
---
i think they will use that idea for atleast one future elitespec
---
they actually should pay up for false advertising since it illegal in most countries, not just offer a refund...
---
I’m not saying you shouldn’t like it. It’s completely valid to like it. You’re probably under the group who didn’t know about arcdps templates or only have 2 or 3 builds. I specifically said there’s going to be people that will like it.
---
My expectations are that of arcdps. Arcdps was made by the community and supplied for free. Anet is not getting rid of arcdps, and replacing it with templates that require gems to expand (which I and others who used arcdps need/would like), and has a limited number of expansions.
---
I hope you can understand my point of view and many others: why are they replacing arcdps with one that’s objectively worse?
---
But yes, there are going to be players like you who will enjoy anet templates. That’s fine, but I hope you also consider why some of us don’t like it.
---
I've definitely seen a few more than usual. When you see a full signet p/p+rifle deadeye fly across the map because they got revealed and panicked it's *really* obvious... but then you don't really care because they don't know what the hell they're doing anyways.
---
I mean. One requires to change an image - the other to reproduce and solve a bug.
---
10s of work versus potentially weeks.
---
I'm one of the rare few who thinks the monetisation is *mostly* fair. Build templates are exactly the kind of thing I would expect to be monetised. They're optional convenience, just like shared inventory slots, material storage expansions, bank tabs, and so on. The existence of a third party tool that we wouldn't even be able to use if they didn't greenlight it doesn't change the fact that people should expect this kind of thing to get monetised.
---
I also agree with OP that the hardcore of the playerbase with over 6 builds on any single character need to understand that they're going to be paying a lot more than your average player to get themselves decked out with all the templates they need. I say this as one of those people; I have five legendary armours and on each of those characters with legendary armour I have more than 6 build or gear templates. Hell, on my mesmer I have 15 gear templates alone. With fractals, raids, WvW, and all the different variations of support chrono, you really eat up the template slots quickly.
---
I am a power user and I identify that. There are many other examples of power users in this game. You could have someone that needs a *ridiculous* amount of inventory space, so they shell out thousands of gold to get ten 32-slot bags on their main (gold that you could buy many build templates with). You could have an altoholic that has dozens of characters, dropping 800 gems on each slot. You could have someone who plays loads of characters and needs all the shared inventory slots he can get. Or a completionist that wants every black lion weapon skin. These are all relatively small minorities of the game that need to pay ridiculous amounts to satisfy how they want to play the game. Raiders, min-maxers, and theorycrafters that need more than two templates per character are no different.
---
What absolutely disappoints me is the cap of 6. I am not looking forward to the downtime I'll cause for my weekly raid static because I don't have space to store all my builds anymore, or the constant alt tabbing to refer to snow crows, or the many trait and stat swaps I'll forget to make because I'll have to do so much stuff manually now. After being spoiled by arc's templates, this is going to genuinely suck. The cap of six ruined what I initially thought was a great system that I had been very excited for.
---
&gt;  and if they throw their most popular content under the bus in favor of supporting the tiny, vocal percentage that wants something different it will kill the game faster than anything else they could possibly do.
---
tInY vOcAl PeR- oh shut up. We have no idea what would be better for the game, LS or instanced repeatable content, because Anet is too afraid of abandoning the current formula and instead chose to live from day to day by pushing out one-off casual content with no depth and zero replayability. It keeps the game on life support, but doesn't really help it grow or maintain community interest.
---
Who's to say cutting back on the number of LS maps in favor of bringing back dungeons wouldn't be better for the game? Dungeons were accessible enough even for casuals to do and were widely successful. Anet cutting them off was probably the biggest mistake they've ever done.
---
dont forget that 1 week after PoF release when Scourge was top tier dmg
---
Yes, engineer with all the super powerful and balanced weapon sets it can wear could benefit from it nicely.
---
&gt;More spying from Google and OneDrive? No thanks!
---
Are you actually serious? 
---
&gt;  Since then, I simply can't trust cloud-based backup services ever again. 
---
So you are untrusting of cloud services because of user error? It is much easier to hit shift+del and enter on a local file and losing it, than having something gone from your cloud storage, as most services have a "safe" recycle bin where deleted files go for \~30 days after deletion unless you speficially empty it, with no way to "delete inmediately" like on windows explorer, osx finder or any linux distro's explorer.
---
&gt;Basic USB HDD copy&amp;paste backup always works. 
---
Unless you want to replicate the data automatically on several machines, like the other guy wanted. Also, physical drive failure is several orders of magnitude more common than having your cloud based data dissapear for anything other than user error.
---
&gt;Yes, let GW2 save templates on Anet server, it is much more convenient.
---
And, AFAIK, the most expensive storage solution on the market. Any amount of money they charge for a single slot is dozens of orders of magnitude more expensive than anything else I'm aware of, not to mention they limit the number of slots you can buy.
---
It does, when you want to commit to high end gameplay in fractals and raids. This gameplay is not supported by Anet.
---
The racing scarfs.  
---
Closest thing we have to capes.

"I just started the game and I don't really know anything about it, but I have an opinion"
---
Noo he deleted his comment and I wrote everything for nothing... I'll just add this here, I'm sorry.
---
&gt;No Burst (quote from deleted comment)
---
That's just a straight up lie, Power Reapers opening burst is extremely high, it fails to keep up the dps in it's loop but for short bursty fights it's pretty good. That's why the dps benchmark is on 31.5k. 
---
Lich form -&gt; 4 -&gt; leave lichform -&gt; well of suffering -&gt; animation cancel with weaponswap -&gt; gs 4 -&gt; gs5 -&gt; cancel gs5 with shroud -&gt; shroud 4.... that's a lot of burst where it starts to struggle is after a few shroud aa chains
---
8 shroud aa chains -&gt; leave shorud -&gt; gs2 -&gt; gs3 -&gt; 2 gs aa chain -&gt; gs2 -&gt; gs3 -&gt; gs4 -&gt; gs5 -&gt; weaponswap cancler you gs5 -&gt; axe 2 -&gt; well of suffering -&gt; cancel endlage with shroud -&gt; shroud 4 -&gt; 5 shroud aa chains..... but where it really falls off is in it's loop
---

---
An advantage of the class in pugs is also that you may not have 100% boon uptime, and Reaper provides itself with a shit ton of boons. But yeah in an optimal group, the reaper will have 2k less dps than everybody else but this is pugs we're talking about where everybody sucks until proven otherwise.
---
We miss some information here. In raids it’s really important to meet the requirements that the commander sets. You said he asked for KP. How many? And you had none. The title is absolutely useless since you can easily get it the first time you do the wing which means you could have just 5 KP. 
---
I think that the whole KP issue played a huge part in you being kicked.
---
They offer some utility, they offer story skips, they offer their version of full makeover kits, they offer cosmetics. They don’t have a loot box yet, but they don’t really need one, when they can get players to willingly pay double in subscription fee just for more bank space.
---
Pls no for everything that you said. No legendary infusion, no skins for infusions.
---
You seem to be missing the point about how he currently manages his existing gear and builds. He's currently using a mod that can swap between dozens of trait and gear combinations with the click of a button. When this ANet system goes live, the mod he's currently using will become disabled and unusable and he will be locked down to 6 gear layouts total (assuming he buys as many as he can). He's not just using these other builds to "try out new ideas". The multiple builds are already tried out and determined. He swaps between them as the situation dictates because no build and gear configuration is optimal for all game modes/bosses/party compositions. And you are severely underestimating all the work that the current mod he's using saves him.
---
Change to dx12 would be huge difference on strong enough machines - it would let draw call thread to be split between cores. That's current main bottleneck for vast majority of MMOs, with GW2 bring one. Also why d12 hack helps a lot with FPS drops while turning camera and all that jazz. Dx11? Not so much.
---
Rewriting code to dx12 would be basically creating engine from zero, making that not possible economically. Wrapper is your best bet if you want to increase performance.
---
no they dont. when was the last comment of her about the game that was not critizing the game for something.
---
TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!
---
&gt; and you can take your ... comment and shove it
---
It's just natural for players to look builds that gives them advantage. Best are builds where you can delete someone quickly without them being able to do anything. 
---
This kind of builds are usually really annoying to opposing party. For me most annoying build at the moment is condi thief. Thankfully I have a build that works against them.
---
Added to the fact how slowly Anet reacts you are usually stuck with horrible meta for weeks. Thankfully they have put a lot of nerfs lately.
---
this sub is the real PR disaster *maker* with its overexeggerations and blowing everything out of proportion all the fucking time.
---
No the convince of unlimited free ones we had for several years now get forced down do only 6 slots (and thats *if* we pay up for more **on each character**) 
---
Theirs will be much less value with this "feature" for hard earned legendary gear, when you can just pay up cash to anet to get the same effect.
---
With templates there will be almost no difference anymore for legendary gear and normal asc, their argument that equipment slot would free up inventory space doesn't really count for legendary gear.
---
for me it's really hard to put my finger on "the happiest" memory. My most recent ones are:
---
\- Getting the /rockout emote
---
\- Getting my first legendary (The ascension PvP legendary backpack)
---
\- Finally finishing core Tyria masteries
---
\- New fashion for my bad ass Charr Warrior looking veteran as heck now.
---
\- Exploring the map / story of the second last chapter of S4. First time standing in the mountain, listening to the chore (music) and then entering the big hall with the smelter. ABSOLUTE AWE! And the story had so much tension, the atmosphere was SO WELL DONE. I love the crazy end fight against kralk (much more than the final fight against his heart). For me this chapter is BY FAR the best done of all existing today. (okay, now I want to replay this chapter again)
---
I don't mind paying for additional template slots. But I do mind that there will be cap on max slots and we will have max 24 templates per account. Atm I have around 20 mesmer builds just for raids + 8 renegade builds, 6 guardian builds, not to mention other characters. I really don't get this limitation.
---
Seems like a lot of hassle for relatively minor gains. If there is any significant advantage beyond style between so many builds, then perhaps ANet should just streamline what works and what doesn't, and to what degree, so that so many builds would not be necessary to achieve essentially the same result of "beating the enemies."
---
The Luminous? armour from SW, it was a mission to get but so fun. All the specialisation weps, theyre actually so unique and detailed up close, and more fun collections!
---
Herald armour, all the little gobbler collections.
---
I love all the collections in this game :)
---
False.
---
Some product manager asked for it. Devs built it. Now you get to have it.
---
My sole purpose in pvp is to annoy people with my mirage

Let's be real here. They do whatever brings in money. And to know what people like, they have to try out things. Some stick, others come back in a slightly different way. But as long as people spend money on all of this, we will get more of them in the store.
---
For example: Arena Net would not design new chairs if nobody would ever buy them. And considering the resources needed to design a new chair asset and the price they are charging, they most likely get an return on investment with less than 500 purchases.
---
 
---
&gt; I still remember when players organized protests in GW1. Like the Monk protest in Thunderhead keeps or the sitting protest in the Great Temple of Balthazar. Maybe something like this is more effective than just bitching about it on Reddit. 
---
You're confusing something here. The Monk protest at Thunderhead Keep was not because Arena Net did something wrong. This was the result out of community behavior. Monks were the only healer in the game back then and people would constantly blame wipes on them. Only taking one Monk to this really difficult Mission but still refusing to take it slow. Everyone was massively overpulling and then blaming the Monk because they struggled to keep the group alive. I was one of the Monks protesting back then.
---
Arena Net stepped in and nerved this mission quiet a lot because the community wasn't able to take it easy and respect each other. And as I said... Monk was the only healer back then. We did hold progress for all of the community BECAUSE the very same community treated us like shit. Arena Net had to step in, otherwise nobody would have been able to complete the story.
---
You can protest as much as you want in GW2 to no effect. Just because of the games design. One group of people can't stop the communities progress in the game anymore, simply by refusing to do certain content.
---
[Skins from Nightmare fractal achievements](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nightmare_weapon_skins) look amazing in-game
---
There are also red versions of them for challenge mote version of the fractal.
---
Did you watch the stream? The tags up the top of the build are limited to 6 and are character bound, you get 3 free at start.
---
The list down the side is account bound, limited to 24 and you get 3 free as standard and an adsl 3 free from the gemstore up to a month afterwards. You purchase more of these in packs of three. All chara can see these and acts as a library.  Thes4 can be out into the char build and any changes you make will not change the char bound template not the one that's in the account bound list
---
You are a evil person and you should be ashamed of yourself.
---
&gt;boy I'm so proud to not engage with content because it requires some effort on my part, I hope they stop making it all together!
---
I've honestly never seen this attitude so common in any other online game I've ever played.
---
kinky, come over.
---
I don't get how anyone can defend a OoL update that has no Quality in it.
---
If there already is a product from outside the company the implemented one should be better, not worse.
---
The one random dude managed to please the need of everyone, be it Raider, Wvw, or just open World experimenter and did promote usage of Legendaries. The endgame gear everyone expected to be part of whatever Anet tries to work on.
---
We will get an abomination that is worse in every way but one. Being able to store gear, which is something that completely invalidates Legendary gear, or the drive to ever craft one again.
---
Ontop of that we are limited in the amount of Templates per characters in a game that has dozens of possible ones per character.
---
No omg the ones with 15-30 builds dont have 6 full sets of asc armor, they worked hard for legendary armor which will loses a lot of their value with this new "feature"
---
None asked for equipment templates main focus being an yet another storage we can/have to pay up for.
---
True veterans (with any sense of the value of time) already left this game ;)
---
amazing update! looking forward to test it out, thanks!
---
Protesting on Reddit has the same effect as protesting ingame. You said it yourself. People complain about a thing for 2 weeks and then it stops. If I would be in charge of Arena Net my reaction would be "Just lay low. It will pass by in a couple of days".
---
As I said. Protest only have an effect if you can actively stop someones plans for the day. Otherwise no one will raise an eyebrow. And this is how it worked in GW1. Monks had the power to bend the whole community to their will. Without a Monk, you were not able to complete the Thunderhead Mission and were locked out from the final Area of the game. And this protest went on for weeks, not only one evening.
---
I simply don't see why Arena Net should care about us protesting ingame against something. It's the same why they don't care about reddit outrage.
---
Have you played the new patch
---
Waiting for the "must attend because its one time event" 15sec cinematic from the first Halloween and that Karkatrain wreck attack, it was annoying as AF but i made few ingame friends from the negative chats.
---
You must have such a good life to want to be outraged by something like this.
---
Would it be possible for the marker editor to accommodate multiple default markers that could be swapped between as the current default marker type? Possibly with their icons as clickable buttons. Marker templates, if you will.
---
I often find that when I am trying to mark several different marker types that I have to mouse through the categories constantly.
---
Holy cow. Mind sharing with us what happened?
---
How convenient that the only way to do something (believe us guys, it's the only way!) is the one that results in an excuse to charge money.
---
They could figure out solutions for that if they really wanted. Maybe the ability to convert some inventory slots for template slots, so people who currently have no issue with inventory space don't need to pay for something they don't need.
---
Great point little warrior, I hadn't thought of it that way🤔🤔🤔
---
&gt; Protesting on Reddit has the same effect as protesting ingame
---
I disagree but we don't have to agree on everything.
---
There is this guy that bought lunch from my work almost every weekdays, he always looks tired and pokerface (but smile when i tried to talk with him). Sometimes i also see him at the gym but always has the same expression. I want to ask "hows your day?" but he always avoiding an eye contact hence im too embarassed to do it because i thought he dont want to be disturbed. Should i go ahead or just let him be?
---
Oh you mean ESO where the developers literally LIED to our faces about the laggy EU servers actually being in the EU (hint: they where not)?
---
Or that they let vampires DESTROY alliance wars while not lifting a finger to fix it? 
---
ESO was dead within 3 months because the devs refused to fixed anything. 
---
Sure they eventually made the EU servers actual EU servers, made it f2p, etc... But it had a horrid launch.
---
I feel like you missed 
---
&gt;And both of them have had / still have old spaghetti code that affects development but they slowly work on it.
---
None of the named MMOs have expanded their character creation beyond what they have now, and in GW2's case there's still an issue where they have to make your character bald if you want to wear hats. Not only that but this isn't related to the engine, they have said many times it's related to the amount of data transferred in real time. 
---
Classes evolving into jobs has nothing to do with spaghetti code, it's just a nightmare to balance two jobs that share a base class, so there was no point in adding more classes if jobs could get the work done just fine. The last class added was Rogue, which was long after ARR launch, when the team was already working on the expansion. The removal of cross class skills was also intended to streamline leveling, nothing to do with spaghetti code.
---
There's a lot of code debt due to 1.0, but it's disingenuous to say they haven't been working on that debt, we would still have the same ARR inventory restrictions if they didn't work on it, we wouldn't have server visit either or cross world PF, and they had to make big changes to the companion spaghetti code just to allow us to summon it with our mount out. 
---
&gt;They also already said that two more FFXIV expansion are already planned, but that they are also working on a completely new game because of the restrictions.
---
Pulled directly out of your ass.
---
Five, thank you very much. I didn't kill Balthazar just to have my achievement disregarded.
---
So you *need* a feature that doesn't exist yet, for something that will save you a few extra clicks. 
---
You must be an easy life if this is the biggest problem you have going on right now. I wish I still had that much free time to waste.
---
Thanks, try again to justify why needing 20+ build templates is a necessity when half the veterans are just laughing at you. 
---
No idea what world you live in that you expect to be catered to like that. There are plenty of other games that do what you're asking for, go play them instead.
---
- ZvZ for DAYS
---
- dungeon runs w experienced groups
---
- world bosses with TTS
---
Speaking of the marker editor, sometimes when I hold down left click and pan the mouse toward the marker editor, it clicks on things when I release left click (even thought I pressed left click down elsewhere; the editor buttons probably trigger on release instead of press).
---
The cursor disappears in game while left click is held and snaps back to that spot when its released, but its position still changes while hidden and the editor still reads that position.
---
The cursor used to bug a long while back and display even while left click was held, which is what made me aware of the interaction as it was more obvious with the visible cursor.
---
Its only really a problem when I'm recording a trail, pan the camera around, and end up activating the stop recording button.
---
&gt;they did prioritize it
---
GW2 is over seven years old. Build templates were not a priority.
---
&gt;So realistically they have less people to work on it than the small guy
---
Uh, this is their job. They have a couple hundered people to work on the game full time rather than one or two people making an add-on as a hobby.
---
&gt;bags  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;griffon mount  
---
&gt;skyscale
---
PoF was released five years after initial release, and the mounts were the key new feature. Not only were the mounts the exciting new thing that would bring people to buy the expansion, they also bring in a ton of money through mount skins. If anything was going to be cut, it wouldn't be these.
---
I don't even know what you mean with the bags comment.
---
&gt;the fact that they got someone to do something for free
---
Something was missing from their game, leading to someone feeling it was worth their time to make something to compensate for the deficiency. ANet didn't approach anyone to make it for them. Maybe with arcdps in the game, they didn't prioritise build templates, but people shouldn't have to rely on a third party program to make switching builds a smooth process.
---
Regardless, as I said, I like that they're being released now but compared to using arcdps as many have for a long time you still either take a step back in flexibility or pay ANet a lot of money.
---
Yesterday I upgraded from a gtx 1050 2gb to a rx 580 8gb. My performance is the same. Extremely disappointed. I only bought the new card for gw2.
---
Infusions as a part of wardrobe and once you get any infusion with effect, you can consume it to unlock the skin and then you can select it on your legendary infusions as with every other gear.
---
The ones who would be perfectly happy with anets templates can't even be bothered to use one proper build in the first place, let alone using 2 build setups for different Scenarios.
---
Whats the point of investing resources for a system with only gather to a player group wo dont even want to use multible builds, while the ones who play multible roles and game modes are heavily restricted in their play stile from now on and are expected to happenly cash out big time for this ****.
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fuze-elbow-dropping-a-hostage
---
I wonder what sort of devilish id they've put on their item database to make it impossible to create a String representation of it.
---
Well if dps is the issue why then DHs (that according to Snow Crows benchamarks does 33k dps) is meta, and reaper (31k dps) is not?? that 2k difference in dps between the two classes make that much of a discrepancy? i really dont get it.
---
Me too lol.
---
I talk about the very old times, where you fight 8v8 and the edgebomb was named by a ranger spirit, edge of life. It was basically a Suizide ball. The spirit would deal AoE DPS whenever someone dies and this was basically a 1 shot build. You'd turn the fight into a big chain reaction, where everybody dies except the ranger who went full HP build and would thus barely survive the instant DPS of 15 ppl dieing.
---
Very fun and very much the oposit of the heal ball strat. At that time we played healball with at least one ele, becsuse the defensive area spells were so damn powerfull. And we had one other class in there as well (for the life of me, I can't remember), rest was 6 monks.
---
This was the funniest sunday afternoon I ever had in GW. (The shit talk in Ts was also fun as heck. :)   )
---
Arc dps can do that.
---
&gt; It's been reiterated multiple times that change to dx11 or 12 wouldn't bring a huge difference when the game is insanely bottlenecked by the single core cpu performance.
---
...
---
Because a lot of work that dx12 lets you do on the GPU has to be done by the CPU on dx9.
---
I don't get how you people defend these practices. Destiny 2 is buy to play, and the QoL updates to systems are always included to the base game free of charge, and in some rare cases you need the expansion(can't remember the last time this happened). I.E: armour 2.0 overhauls the mod system of every piece of armour in the game and they don't charge you for it, not once and much less a "here's some free updates and a 25 piece limit you can also buy!".
---
My bad, I didn't realize that only hard core vets are allowed to have an opinion. I wonder how many people will stick around to the be the hard core vets of the future with attitudes like yours getting about....
---
I watched the stream, but seem to have missed a lot of information, because you seem to know a lot more about what will be sold in which packets to a maximum of xxx.
---
Is the 24 really the max? Because I can remember the dev saying something in the lines of "rieght ow the limit is 24". Which I could interpret, it's the limit at that time, where they showcase the system. But having a search function implemented for a tab with max 24 different items in it seems rather useless. Thus I can imagine this list limit becomming much larger.
---
Do you have some links to more detailed information / where you got all your infos from?
---
Thanks in advance
---
They can't breathe,  haven't learned swimming or floating.  they re scared of water
---
I was thinking about searching for every comment in this subreddit that basically said "I would pay for Build Templates" and quote them all here. But then I remembered that I have better things to do with my time.
---
Yes but its 24 account bound plus 6 per char or 3 if you dint buy more
---
I think you misread my comment, I'm not trying to shit on you O.o Those achievements *are* a pain in the arse, and I haven't got most of them myself.
---
2 hours of story tops
---
Smug? Are you alright? Do you need a hug? 
---
You complain about how others organize their squads so the best solution would be to open your own squad with your own rules. Holy shit...
---
We'd definitely get more complaints around here if they did that.
---
added functionality for changing all your Legendary stuff at once, isnt really all that great if most of the builds, players who optimize and play different roles use, are mixed stats and not just 100 % berserker.
---
Raiding always suffers, mostly for reasons not related to delta.
---
Imagine being this dumb
---
This here is basically why legendary gear is losing 90% of its QoL. For equipement "templates", legendary is the same as ascended. And this is not what I had in mind when I made legendary gear.
---
&gt; another day another build templates thread
---
you mean hour
---
Why did they need an update for that? Isn't the gem store just a web browser? Can't they just update the picture from their side?
---
It's design change that I'm personally very happy with.
---
I believe you are mistaking me for [Chaithh](https://www.twitch.tv/chaithh). Granted, just now I realised how we might be mistaken for each other based on our physical appearance :P
---
You might as well leave the comment there, such that the correction might also show properly. I appreciate your willingness to correct an error! But it is your call entirely :)
---
This also causes that you won't have easy access to your weapons from your inventory.
---
I play ele almost exclusively, if I have gear templates that use all of my  different weapons I wont have easy access to them anymore without constantly fiddling and editing my build templates. I wont have easy access to other weapons to easily take focus for safety on some skip, to blast might. I cant even use ride the lightning for a quick boost anymore.
---
I made my legendaries so I dont have to carry multiples of the same weapon for different situations. Now it seems like I have to. I cant even change sigils easily anymore. If I want to switch to a night sigil for a fractal that night sigil will now be on the template by default.
---
Legendary gear was always vanity equipment. There is a reason why it doesnt have superior stats, its not meant to be *any* better than other gear.
---
So reducing the gameplay/qol advantage of having legendary is good and makes sense.
---
if current template system goes as it is now i even sense people quitting or giving up on competitive play and do maybe 1 dungeon a week or stick to 1 mode like fractals or wvw or stick 1 class raid because such downgrade to game itself is one of biggest selfburns in any company i've seen over 15years towards "QoL" for playerbase
---
Extorting the high end playerbase in favour of the broad base of casuals is an anet special. Altho usually the fact that the vast majority of resources go to the casual playerbase is defended by those players by claiming they pay for it. Do they tho? 
---
I dont recommend supporting these practises. Why would wvwers or raiders spend money on templates that are heavily limited compared to arc? The monitization is designed to milk you and they are taking away your alternative option, which was better and free and available years sooner.
---
If anet provided a GOOD system, it would easily out compete a third party addon. After all they can make it built in with full access to the source. But their product is garbage and overpriced and they know it, which is why they force the alternatives out.
---
No matter howmuch you spend, the content you enjoy will still be neglected. If you get updates they'll be catered towards casual players over you each and every time. If you get new raids they'll be so easy they're only raids by name. Jk they're strike missions now. Any improvements or QoL you do get will be heavily monetized. 2k gems for a DPS meter when? 
---
If alliances ever comes out, dont be surprised when after waiting 19 years for an essential update they'll charge you 50€ to continue playing wvw at all. It's how anet rewards its veteran and high end playerbase for being dumb enough to put up with their incompetence for years.
---
what?
---
They just need to give us another templates system or something, which will only effect legendary gear stat choices and dont let asc gear be effect by that.
---
None asked for this "free storage space" in favor for extremely limiting the number of builds you can use to only 6
---
I've been playing since july of this year and have attended several raid trainings, and I honestly have no idea what you mean by "this community". For every "raid elitist" I've seen in this game who asks for X or Y requirements in raids, I've seen at least 20 "casual elitists" that want content removed from the game. Every post discussing raids in this subreddit has a similiar ratio of people asking for reasonable features for raids to people saying they want raids removed from the game. The most trouble I had finding a raid training group was looking around this subreddit and finding the EU raid training discord server.
---
Ok? We shouldn't put a build switching feature in a game that promotes build flexibility because a minority of players want the convenience to be exclusive to an expensive and time consuming in game version. That's what I'm getting from this.
---
Don't play Chrono, I'll tell ya that much.
---
No different to me having the game on one screen abs stopping and starting a youtibe vid on the second, that I no longer needed to do for the past few years
---
&gt;and blaming them for not wanting to play with you.
---
He's specifically telling you to open your own group, what makes you think groups asking for X kill proof want to raid with somoene who can't be bothered to start their own group with people of similiar experience or look for one of the many beginner friendly raid training groups?
---
Imagine being an experienced raider and wanting to complete the raids with other experienced raiders in a timely manner and now you return back to your safespace Lions Arch where everyone is a quaggan because you are too shy to lead your own group that is for beginners or simply joining training runs, just like what everyone else does who starts raiding. But no, take the easy way. Complain about others while doing nothing yourself.
---
Join a guild and domste them 😉
---
For every person protesting on reddit, someone ingame will buy a chair, armor skin, glider skin or mount skin. I am not against speaking up if there is something fishy going on. But the sad truth is that nobody will care. Only exception would be, when all of the sudden 100% of the community refuses to buy things from the store. And we both know: That's not going to happen.
---
I'm telling you the choice to move forward with jobs was not as a workaround for some spaghetti code, it was a design choice. The entire class system makes no sense when they only evolve into a single job, ACN was the test subject, ACN completely failed and moving forward they decided to abandon classes, because they added absolutely nothing when they no longer wanted branching jobs. Removing classes would make even less sense because they would have to retcon class quests, like for exampleTHM quests are not talking about BLM, they talk about THM, so you can't start the game as a level 1 BLM. 
---
HW jobs starting at 30 was another design choice so people wouldn't burn out of leveling
---
SB and ShB jobs only requiring another class/job at 50/60 was another design choice because people complained that HW jobs were too gated. 
---
I really don't see where are you seeing spaghetti code in any of this, if the class system was that muddied they wouldn't have made Rogue a class and just made it Ninja, they just chose to go with jobs only after Ninja. 
---
&gt;If that's not the definition of a legacy feature that can't be removed but still influences every Job change done in the future, then I don't know what you would consider restricting game design.
---
Your confusion is that a legacy feature is not spaghetti code. The inability to sort your linkshells is spaghetti code. The existence of classes is an old feature they could remove if they want to, but they don't because it's pointless and not a good investment of dev resources when they can just keep moving forward with the new system. The existence of classes does not restrict new jobs in any way, whereas retainer spaghetti code doesn't let you summon more than one retainer at the same time. 
---
&gt;Rogue was supposed to be in the game with the 2.0 relaunch but was not ready. And it released with Patch 2.3 - 9 months after ARR. It starts also at level 1 but you can't pick it right from the character creation BECAUSE they can't change it without reworking the whole system.
---
If this was a case of spaghetti code they wouldn't have been able to add Rogue at all without breaking something, the fact that they are able to add new classes, to modify old class skills, or (as of 5.0) able to disable old class skills once a new job is learned (sch) means they can still manage the classes code. Like I said above these were all design reasons, they wanted you to know the game before being able to start as these jobs. 
---
&gt;Ehm... Not really? SE said more than once that the Zodiac story is written out to fit 3 more expansions. They said this before Shadowbringers hence, 2 more expansions. And Yoshi P himself said that he is working on an unannounced Project what may result in him stepping down from FFXIV sometime in the future.
---
The plot of Hydaelyn and Zodiark will reach a conclusion, it doesn't mean FFXIV will end, it means a new villain will be introduced. I mean look at the sub we're on, plenty of villains have been introduced and died in GW2. Check out WoW and look at all the villains that have been introduced and killed or gone away. FFXIV has had the same Ascian plot since 1.0, now they want to conclude it to end the last connection to 1.0. 
---
Yoshida is working on another project, but https://www.pcgamesn.com/final-fantasy-xiv/no-sequel
---
And he never said he was stepping down, so that's another thing you're making up.
---
This is why anet cant do qol. 
---
They have artists and story designers that make up a bunch of fluff, but any new system or change to the engine is next to impossible.
---
I'm not sure, but don't they write exactly about this in a blog post?  
---
[https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/learn-all-about-build-and-equipment-templates/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/learn-all-about-build-and-equipment-templates/) 
---
&gt;Equipment Templates can also record the customization of legendary items, which can freely change attributes and upgrades. You can equip a single legendary item to multiple Equipment Templates with different attributes and upgrade choices for each. 
---
It looks that you will be able to use one legendary weapon as multiple ascended ones. Or do I misunderstand?
---
True, but complaining about it and doing nothing at the same won't help either.
---
Legendaries not working is clearly an issue that needs to be fixed. 
---
People keep bringing money into the argument... that's why I was asking what the value for the thing is. I'm not actually buying into the system more than likely. I'm just trying to help the argument be a more positive one that might get us as a community get something that is actively useful for devs to see rather than just bitching about how everything in the world isn't free. That's not reality. I actually appreciate mentioning the legendaries because that's an honest argument. That's the sort of thing people should be saying not "Gear swap should be free", that's not helpful. It was NEVER going to be free... if they don't pay their bills there will be no game. And if gear swap was going to be free and they were only making money on extra bag slots then they wouldn't have bothered with gear swap at all, but they wanted it in the game and so they had to figure out a way to pay for it. This is how they are doing it.  Would you rather just have gear swap for 400 gems with no storage instead of gear swap with storage for 400 gems? (assuming at some point in time legendary issue gets fixed). I am sure they could have probably gone that way, but I appreciate the added value.
---
I was gonna say, nobody is upset over having to log out and download a patch just so ANET could fix the banner on the GEM STORE?
---
Yes.  Hence the outrage.
---
Go for it, worst that can happen is that he doesn't wanna talk
---
[deleted]
---
Yes, they do, but think about it for a second. Now we have separated storage for different sets of armor, meaning if we have 2 sets of ascended armor, one is equipped and other is waiting in the item template, not taking inventory space. Exactly the same as legendary armor now, multiple ascended sets won't take inventory space, making legendary obsolete, except for build experiments. Instead of crafting super expensive and complex legendary armor, you can get an ascended sets, with the same effect of clear inventory. Even after multiple stat changes and rune overrides, price of having 2-3 ascended sets will be lower than legendary armor cost (ascended sets can be produced basically for free, after a couple fractal runs...).
---
Yes but its not convenient to use anymore. We used to carry around several  ascended, for example, daggers with different stats and sigils. When we crafted a legendary dagger we could just switch the sigils on the fly and get rid of those 5 ascended daggers. 
---
Now that legendary dagger is taken by a build template. And if we want to switch a sigil then we have to open the build template and edit it to have the sigil on by default.
---
That doesn't mean he's stepping down. That quote literally said "I'm not even thinking about stepping down until X", zero consideration. It doesn't mean he will do it, it doesn't mean he won't, it means the thought is completely out of the table until the game reaches a point. 
---
What he did say before is that he wanted someone else to take the mantle of producer (aka head of publishing the game), but he would still retain the mantle of director (aka head of development). Even offered Toshio Murouchi to take over the job of producer in a live stream, but Murouchi said he would never do as a good job as Yoshida.
---
&gt;"They also already said that two more FFXIV expansion are already planned, but that they are also working on a completely new game because of the restrictions."
---
So you weren't talking about a new MMO? What did you mean by "they are also working on a completely new game because of the restrictions"? What's the correlation between the restrictions of FFXIV, an MMO, with a new game that is not an MMO?
---
The only reason people craft wvw legendary armor is because of QoL - it has exactly the same look as ascended armor.
---
This morning I played two matches and ran into the same hybrid Rev both times.  He would stand on point and channel Protective Solace.
---
As Scepter/Pistol + Staff Mirage, I was 100% hard countered.  He could stand on point, and I could stand next to him, and all of my attacks were 'destroyed' by his shield.  All I could do was stand next to him to try and deny the point, at which point he just start pecking me with his staff auto attack.
---
I'm still a newer PvP player, and say what you will about Mirage, but this is the first time I've seen a situation where I was completely powerless to do any damage to another player.  All I could do was rotate off and hope one of the 4 randoms on my party with melee weapons would do something.
---
Mirage isn't the only thing that sucks 'fun' out of PvP.
---
Datamines stuff by looking for changes to the .dat file. Sometimes he gives us sneaky preview of things to come (mostly gem store stuff) but is always very good to keep story spoilers and big stuff quiet - plus changes in the .dat file may not necessarily go live ever, so occasionally he just finds odd forgotten/unknown things. Occasionally also makes entertaining or funny videos.
---
His twitter is quite interesting.  [https://twitter.com/that\_shaman](https://twitter.com/that_shaman)
---
It would be more profitable to not have a limit to the number they can sell. Why is there a limit?
---
We'll make Legendary infusions cost 250,000 gold but allow you to select any aura you want.
---
Let's see... They could use 10,000 mystic coins and 1,000 charged quartz. Oh and you'll need to salvage 1,000 regular +9 infusions.
---
How's that, playerbase? No? Oh well, this is just a heads up. Not asking for feedback.
---
Did we mention how much we love you guys?
---

---
p.s. Look at this quaggan art! Isn't it cute?
---
Censorship strikes again! Soon this sub reddit will be just like the official forums. Any dissenting opinion to the gulag.
---
Legendaries were always prestige items, being able to store two ascended sets in two different template storage doesn't devalue legendaries, you still have freedom of stat swap anytime you want, which is the main appeal of legendary. 
---
I never though that people out there were making legendaries with inventory space in mind, and not the prestige and QoL of having any prefix you want.
---
they still do get the hate in wvw zerg/squads. I dont know if the balance patch changed that but I highly doubt it.
---
Merchants aren't subject to the law of gravity provided they didn't attend law school.  Bugs Bunny taught us this.

(Edit for formatting)
---
Here's the problem, there are many PVE builds, and, if we're going off of PVE, there's a different gear set up between Fractals and Raids due to how potions interact in fractals.  I'm not going to cover PvP as it's just 4 Sigil selections, a rune selection, an amulet selection, a trait set up, a skill set up, and you're done.  It's way faster and easier than selecting gear for PvE/WvW.

---
If you want to play all classes across all content and have all builds for meta play, you'd need at least 8 slots to store trait set ups, and 10 slots to store gear.  Already you'd need *more* slots than they plan on even allowing you to have.  Given how everyone starts with 3 trait slots and 2 equipment slots across the account, to acquire enough slots, assuming they're character bound instead of account bound, you'd need to buy *74* trait slots and 75 equipment slots.  Since each character can only have a maximum of 6 of each, you would need at least 13 characters to spread out all these builds, which means buying 8 character slots from the base 5, or buying 7 character slots if Heart of Thorns has been purchased.
---
i'll give her some attention. i'll even give her something new to worship.
---
Aside from mixing the build and gear template idea, remember you can use storage for pristine templates and copy them to characters.
---
&gt;Build Storage can hold templates of any profession and can be accessed by any character on your account. You can copy, rename, clear, or inspect them the same way you would a Build Template tab, and copy and paste a template to and from tabs and storage
---
The right thing was allowing arcdps in the first place man... that's what they did. They wanted to add templates but they knew it wasn't prioritized high so they let someone else do his thing until their list allowed for it. That's the right thing. No they didn't have to do it now, they also never had to allow arcdps to exist in the first place. They could have done both, not allowed arcdps and not done it now. &lt;shrug&gt;
---
The reason that the money isn't as much of an argument starter as you think it is because arcdps are the an extreme minority, and the numbers that would actually leave is even lower (most people admit less than 1% of the population uses arcdps, of that I think less than a quarter would consider quitting without it... quality of life is rarely a make it or break it option... it's usually yeah that makes life better).
---
How much money they are trying to make on the player base is... &lt;shrug&gt; clearly not enough because the company is struggling. Which... if it doesn't make money off the players.. GW2 closes anyway so I guess losing .025% of the population is a valid argument for keeping the doors open for the rest of us. It'd be nice if they stuck around, but I'd rather the game survive. There's a place in the MMO universe for it. Anet has a ton of stuff they give away for free... this feature had monetization written all over it. And that's fine. They have to come up with new ways to monetize every now and then. Raising the cap on bank and bag slots only helps so far... new things are needed periodically.
---
These sorts of features are meant to target 1% of the population who may not be paying in as much as other parts of the population may be. I doubt the majority of the population will buy more than a couple of these slots because most of the population doesn't need it. I also would argue that the people this is specifically targeting (hardcore players, who btw are also the most taxing players on developers day in and day out and probably should be paying more) are the ones most likely to be swimming in gold or capable of making a lot of gold in a short amount of time so probably wouldn't be paying in anyway. (I've seen so many people on these boards brag about how you can get 800 gems easily in 4 hours of play. That's 2 slots right there.)
---
Sure. As I said, your opinion matters to you.
---
The thing is.. I have too a right to give them the finger and move on to a different game. Which is basically - the plan. Shame about gw2 it was great while it lasted, now its just a trash heap of shite balance and terrible microtransaction decisions (such as this one).
---
Thankfully there is no end to good games out there :)
---
Oh and "entitled"? Sweetie, this is a competitive market. One co. decides that its "time to feed you some of that delicious shitsandwich"? You just vote with your wallet and move on.
---
&gt;  I just call bs on it when I see it because I don't think it's being fair or reasonable to the devs. 
---
I do love people like you. Please understand that advent of mobile game style micro transactions in normal games is basically your fault. You will literally eat the aforementioned sandwich and beg for more.
---
By the way. If they would say "pay us full expac price (50 quid? whatever.) and get to use Arcdps buildtemplates (official version 1.0)" I'd simply reach for the wallet. At least it would actually patch with the official patches on day 1. Its a hack. Sure. Its a rough hack. Sure. But it works.
---
What we are getting is worse, more limited and very likely far far more expensive than a price of the full expac.
---
But you enjoy that shitsandwich
---
What's your point? Remove legendary armor from the game?
---
I dont get it. Gw2 is free, why dont you just play what you want. Almost everything can be played in endgame when you equip yourself correctly. When you want to know which builds are meta, check snowcrows for raids, and metabattle for a generell overview.
---
&gt;  I am fairly new to GW2, a matter of a few months, so I can't claim to have a massive amount of experience. 
---
Then why do you think you can tell those people who *do have* the experience and want to play the game in their optimized way what they need?
---
Your dps number?
---
I always made them with legendary space in mind. Now I'm on disadvantage mainly because I can't have different looks tied to different stats  like people with ascended armor have AND I have no benefit to it like before which was inventory space. With 6 different builds not having 60 inv slots permanently taken was a blessing.
---
I never cared about looks of these as the looks are usually obnoxious :P.
---
No point discussing then, I guess.
---
That's not min-maxing, that's being able to play roles. Min-Maxing Chrono would lead to 30+ templates.
---
The guy above, literally says that he doesn't need more than one template per char.
---
You agree with him, you played for years.
---
Something doesn't add up.
---
i wasn't referring to my dps? take another guess
---

You got all the rewards via the wvw and pvp track
---
Legendary scepter?
---
But it is vastly easier and faster to open inventory and double click the weapon you want to equip than open hero panel -&gt; go to equipment/armory -&gt; go to correct lodout -&gt; press weapon you want to swap -&gt; press new weapon to equip.
---
It will impact how I play the game in a big way, and this is one of the largest concerns I have with this change.
---
My group does clear on monday. Im running reaper for almost all power bosses. Its even best class to cleave, perfect for solo lamp w6 and so on. For ppl who laugh at u for using it, u r better without them, you really dont wish to redo bosses where guards and eles and terrible holos die to ret. One more great perk of reaper is that its really hard to have bad dps on it :).
---
FYI when you get to Orr you may switch to Mace since it's better defense and healing. Rem that Vanilla Orr has all the condi spam risen zergs/blobs which can be overwhelm for Core specs.
---
A lot of people dont use the legendary skins for legendary armor anyway. They just link their gear randomly to show off. That goes for all types of legendary armor, even Envoy armor is often reskinned.
---
Its still vanity gear, even if people use another skin.
---
C’mon, don’t be naive. As if you guys don’t understand the implication of what he’s saying. And there are other ways of delivering the news you’re quitting the game and why.
---
Yea, I used they're fixing my mistake as justification to spend at least that much more on gems. The team who deals with  that stuff seem to be great. I know they're refunding people real quick after the chair debacle too.
---
Right? And get I am taking them for granted like a b-hole.
---
I think you don't even play the game. There are no receipts for gold to gems, and the gold I have already spent on gems, isn't visible anywhere.

First person view. Combat mode toggle. Wardrobe system. Account bound ascended and legendaries. Account bound changes all over the place for that matter (dyes for example. Even refunding you for any duplicates across characters). Condition stacking. Multi guild chat without needing to change reps. LFG tool. Consume all. Quantity buying from merchants.
---
You're exaggerating. Unless you mean blow up in terms of praise for implementing the above and other QoL changes.
---
I'd 100% pay 15 a month for gw2 if it released even 50% of the content wow does lol
---
So (implicitly) threatening to leave the game is not negative and toxic, and critiquing someone about his chosen method of critique is?  Fair enough.
---
Just a few days ago, I was showing a guildie who finally finished their griffon masteries (they hadn't played regularly for quite some time) the griffon adventures in pof maps, and 1) my friend was having a great time learning to fly, and 2) I realized that, at some point between when I'd first done them all (in a frustrating week or so, sometimes spending an embarrassing amount of time trying to reliably fly through them AND shave those last few tenths of a second off my time to get gold) I'd gotten much, much better at flying my griffon. I had spent SO LONG on the one in amnoon, and now, even with a kitten spilling water all over my mousepad in the middle, I could reliably fly through it for gold. It was easy! And still fun! 
---
My other, much older, favorite story is the first time I'd ever been in Harathi, before the megaservers, I was exploring, following events, and one person who WAS familiar with the map gathered everyone they saw into a party, asking us to stay for the whole event chain... which is how we ended up doing that whole meta event with the five of us in a party, and one random extra. It was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND CRAZY! The one thing that makes me sad about the megaservers is that you never see core tyria meta events like that anymore...
---
(oh, and the first time I did the hidden garden jp after gliding was added to core tyria!!!)
---
I used to say that everyone else was cheating too
---
I'll take free slots. I sometimes run around with 4 sets of gear including the ones i'm wearing. THOUGH, i'm not sure that this will add more spaces, it might just make it easier to equip your items from you inventory where they'll be staying.
---
I agree its not solvable before the 29th, in fact I don't think its solvable without a complete rewrite of how the templates work in the background, which won't happen. I was just trying to make something clear that outside of peoples opinion of the monetization etc it has pretty critical design flaws for people that would like to use it extensively too.
---
As for your point, I can totally see where you are coming from, and our visions are polar opposites, but I would have loved an option for it at least to toggle this off, because for me and a lot more (hardcore) pve players this is a big turnoff to what templates should be.
---
NO NO NO
---
I miss dungeons
---
You will have to resave any templates you want to use any time you switched gear. Yes this is a down grade from arc.
---
That chair in that image was like 2-3 times bigger that for what we got in game (ignoring the inferior sitting animation). 
---
Theirs a limit on how much you can you can use the "look better" method others use fur burgers and such. Even they are only allowed to use the same indigent/items for advertising imagery, then what you get when you buy a real one.
---
Tried to at least. I have run with 3 raid trainings (spirit vale) but for one reason or the other we failed to complete them (first one a group of 3 had to leave, 2nd one we failed for around 2h and collectively called it quits, third time almost got to the last encounter before the guy guiding us had to leave due to an IRL emergency, i guess i got bad luck). The guys guiding us were extremely kind and did not rage at all, I know I would have at least been upset about some mistakes made on the last run if it was a team I was taking through a destiny raid and would have at least snuck in a sassy comment or two.
---
The problem isnt even that it's for free. The problem is it seems to be far superior to the paid service.
---
If build templates are "10$ for 10 builds each char, another 10$ for unlimited" it would be fine. The way it seems right now sounds rather bad, character based is just awful, max 6 is a joke, and i still dont know if they can properly rune swap on leg armor.
---
Yes it is. Now suffer well.
---
ok i get it now. i see your point, arc templates would just revert you back to default build. but hey, there's option now to help you with the hassle, you can just change all legendary trinket/weapon/armor stats at once in the customize window, so you can experiment with that
---
GW2 is extremely limited by how much your first core can process. Most graphics cards aren’t the bottle neck, it’s the cpu.
---
Especially now that most CPUs are focused on multi-core performance rather than 2 extremely powerful cores.
---
The inventory would weigh them down too much and they'd drown before the actual timer executes them horridly as on land.
---
Just show your support for anet's ideas by quit playing GW2 and go play WoW Classic!
---
This would save any problem and make aperfect system. Sad Anet didn't do that.
---
How you liking that White Knight class, anyway?
---
Or two of them...
---
I fooled around with SB for a bit in OW, and I used the Machined Dagger because it paired so well with Iron Beast Greatsword
---
My guess would be that the claims of technical difficulties are exaggerated and what is really behind the low number is PR considerations. I know this sounds weird, why would a low number be good PR?
---
Let me explain:
---
* As soon as they announce prices, someone will calculate what it costs to unlock everything. If that sum is too big, it will produce ugly headlines. Yes, it is stupid, but people do get riled up by a single big number more than by the actual details of how any given system works.
---
* Assuming they get over the inevitable initial outrage, increasing the cap later is a relatively easy way to create positive news and additional sales.
---
* If the outrage is too big before release they can increase the cap in a classical *"See, we listen to your feedback"* move.
---
‘Returning’ player but never really got that far beyond 80 in the past so basically new. 
---
Am I missing something with these champion mobs in open world PvE? I’ll be in a level 15-25 area and these guys will kick my ass and one shot me even if there is like 4 of us.. 
---
Am I doing something totally wrong or are they meant to be some late game content in a low level area? They just feel really janky and out of place
---
There's no way suing ArenaNet for false advertising over a dang banner picture would work.
---
Besides, can you not preview the chair before buying it? I've never tried to buy a chair so I'm not sure.
---
I've been playing since around July and have assisted 3 (failed) raid trainings for spirit vale, on the last one we almost got to the last encounter before one of the guides had to quit for an IRL emergency. I still have no clue what's the whole deal with so many people proud of not going into raids, or making it seem like you require a firstborn's sacrifice. I'm also a destiny raider, have done at least a weekly raid since the first raid came out for destiny 1, and there is honestly no difference in trying to put a group together for a raid for any of the skill levels I've played both games at. There are maybe even more dedicated "training" groups here in GW2 than over at D2. As in GW2, Destiny 2's raids also have mechanics that appear nowhere else in the game. Just [watch a guide to the calus encounter to see what I mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaxbNMbEo4I), this is the last encounter on a 4 encounter raid, and IMO the easiest or second easiest encounter of the raid. You need communication with your team, and you need to aim your weapons on top of all that.
---
No, just that the concerns of those who have Legendary armor are largely irrelevant to the game as a whole. Once they open up ways that 50%+ of the players have Legendary armor, then they would become a worthwhile consideration.
---
Cause it's easy, and it does a lot of damage.
---
*^(They just wanted the souuuulssss)*
---
We pay for 
---
Inventory Bag slots
---
Bank tabs
---
Account wide bag slots
---
But build tabs is too far?
---
Or you can buy it for 800 gems from the gem store. In the end you decided the height of your character. No one other then you is to blame for that. Either buy a kit or delete the character.
---
You occasionally find one from a BL chest, and you'll get some keys from the story or map completion, so I'd just be patient.
---
It's ok, but I miss the extra gold find GM trait from the Shill spec. Still, you can't beat the might/prot uptime for WK.
---
&gt; Brain drain at ArenaNet is real.
---
I don't think it's that. Anet IMO is a bit notorious of overdesigning things. They find something to implement, but everyone does it the same way so Anet will instead try to be innovative and go one step beyond - except it's going to end up worse, not better. Being unique is a bigger priority than being good.
---
You can also buy it for 350 gems at regular price; and you get one at 5000 achievement points, too, alongside 400 gems.
---
Or you could just buy a makeover kit for 350 gems, which is maybe 150g? That's what we all have to do.
---
Yeah, I know it's a me problem. I really should have restarted when first noticed lol
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks
---
Buy a Total Makeover Kit in the gem store for 350 gems. What's the big deal?
---
The gear will probably stored very similar to how the chatcodes work. That would mean a few bytes (!) per gear piece. 
---
Complete Bullshit.
---
This isn’t true. If you open the client right now you can change the stats of all armor OR weapons OR trinkets, not all. It’s easier now, but still not as streamlined as you’d think it would be. I also don’t have tunes to test if those have a change all option.
---
Why did you add the pointless grammar?
---
,That, eventually, 
---
Is this 4th grade English?
---
thats what i said, slash means "or". op wants to switch just few pieces to get 1700 toughness so that works in their advantage
---
You aren’t doing anything wrong. The game downscales you to match the level of the mobs in the area. You aren’t going to plow through them like a bulldozer, you actually have to play smart.
---
Yes this is also a problem when you try to to share acc bound equip from one char to another, you cant do that, like you were able to do with arc before, without completely destroying 2 of your equipment templates (one of each char). This sometimes defeats the purpose of buildtemplates in the first place and no amount of money spending can circumvent that.
---
Shhh.... you can’t say the “D” word around here.
---
FF14 template is there, they just have to copy it :( smh even your hotkeys are customized according to the loadout!
---
Am I having key runs flashbacks right now?
---
And this is why I'll never take this sub seriously
---
That's a good point, I think I might be becoming a tech-illiterate old man.
---
It was summer 2012.  So no Edgebomb. We used builds that we dominated with in Alliance Battles.
---
4 Starburst Eles, two Shockwave eles.
---
This was in kessex hills I believe but I’ve seen them in a few maps. 
---
Yeah  I tried to do a bounty one in kryta when I was level 10 and soon realised that wasn’t going to work solo..
---
I can only imagine the level of wailing on this sub from raiders who get their accounts banned and lose all their crap.
---
imo ball should have more dye channels
---
But seriously, I haven't seen worst numbers than fotm weavers. 9 out of 10 are usually doing less damage than the healer. And are the less cooperative and communicative, too.
---
I only kick when people don't read lfg and join with a role that isn't required, but that little pain when we see the Weaver icon...
---
Thanks for explaining. it's really a disappointment. I got my legendary specificly to have not to craft multiple sets for every character. At the moment this prevents me from switching classes often. I hoped templates would help but the announcement was such a let down that I'm not really interested anymore in anything more than playing every few months the story. The more you play the game and all it mods, the more it gets cumbersome.
---
&gt; Or in personal guild message of the day.
---
Has anyone started a guild called [bT]Build Templates yet, could be success?
---
It really isn't and yeah new players do tend to find them difficult. Then again new players to PvP find every meta class frustrating to deal with. 
---
Personally I find Scourge to be more of a pain in the ass than Mirage with all of the massive AoE condi circle BS they have in a game mode that focuses on standing in little circles.
---
&gt;You get legendary armor for doing a lot of raiding
---
&gt;Raids are the place you would want to use build templates
---
People in here are butthurt because we all get to enjoy some QoL.
---
In to the fire lads!
---
Since POF I cant have fun in PVP if there's a Mirage on the other team. Its almost impossible for me to deal with a good Mirage. I catn believe ANET let such a broken thing in their game.
---
Anyways,
---
What are the good specs that I can play to counter Mirage, both in 1v1 and Team Fights?
---
I am open to any recomendations!
---
You talk about inaccuracy but FFXIV engine can't even load that much people on your screen before it starts culling people.
---
Extra  bonus when the boss doesn't even load on your screen and you lose the rewards because of it. At least GW2 has not reached that level of  bad.
---
Also. Are we comparing the same settings? My computer can handle a full wvw map battle at minimal settings just fine. On FFXIV I need to thank all gods if the boss loads quick enough for me to get full rewards.
---
&gt; This game is free
---
It literally is not free, unless you mean free to play accounts which is so restricted it really is just a trial.
---
&gt; For equipement "templates", legendary is the same as ascended. And this is not what I had in mind when I made legendary gear.
---
So, whats the problem? Does anything change for you? Did they take anything away?
---
Does the log file say anything interesting?
---
This is a pretty notorious problem. I think it was best captured during LS3 when people pointed out how the darker areas in Draconis Mons affected a character's body vs how it affected their armor. For some reason, the two are treated very differently when it comes to lighting.
---
They are items, which give cosmetic effect. That is not equal to a skin. Skin is something you unlock and can put on any other item with same item base. This is something which should not be applied to infusions with comestics for mulitple reasons.
---
Well we have strikeeons now's. Here's hoping they actually do well with them
---
Exactly. dx912pxy is fucking incredible. My min framerate is over 50% higher and everything is so smooth. 
---
But it also works flawlessly for me, so I don't care if Anet do it or don't when I can just use that instead and get more than acceptable framerate.
---
Since you’re updating Taco is there any way you can make it so raid window tells you which wing has [call of the mists?](https://tinyurl.com/yy8lvgcc) Maybe change the text color blue?
---
When playing something where I want to quickly swap sigils etc. Like fotm. 
---
And it's not like I have a full inventory open, its the smallest I can possibly set it.
---
Yup, either ele or Engi could get weaponswap as their new unique elite spec trait, for elementalist the "drawback" could be less equipped attunements? (Only 2 but you pick which ones you equip) itll be revenant lite!
---
It's not the final stance but actually you can't use templates in wvw outside the keep :) They talked about it in the guild chat.
---
"largely irrelevant to the game" lol
---
Do you have for base-game GW2, PoF and the other LW releases? I remember those being available as well.
---
Thing is, most of these builds aren’t required to do the content.
---
The game is largely faceroll if you apply even a modicum of brain power and effort, with minimal build diversity needed.
---
By that logic ascended is just vanity gear. Most people reskin them also.
---
That's $5.00 (U.S.) to sit in a chair in what's supposed to be an MMORPG. Whether you buy gems with cash or buy gems with gold buying a chair in a MMO is absolutely rediculous IMO.
---
Launch week as a Norn.
---
I ran down to the starting area and it was endless events. Help answer raven's riddles. Help protect bear's cave. Some Norn want you to go into a cave for a series of events where there is devil statue worshipping. Hey gotta go do an escort quest series into the hills to stop these guys in an ice cave. It felt like a real world with things happening if I did or did not help out.
---
It felt so alive with activity and I am not talking about the # of players. Years later I ran through the area again and hardly any events are going on in the lower zone these days its boring.
---
How can something be relevant if 99% of players do not have it at all?
---
How much for a comission?
---
the tl;dr is that it's partly because we can't use the third party add-on any more. That's understandable, but we're not convinced the new system will offer the same functionality when it comes to the number of builds we're able to save. Even if it did, it'd be potentially very expensive to replicate what we currently have under the new system.
---
Tanks want 400-ish toughness
---
Maybe a new fan made add-on can manage the external txt local build storage using this system? The base system itself might still be useful for that kind of thing and might even make it easier to make a ToS compliant add-on for it. Kinda like hearthstone decks back when they had limits, the community created a program to store decks outside of the game and pull them in as needed
---
About 3fiddy.
---
No, it's not usually despite what people think. Usually it's simple code that "It's too risky to attempt to change that code without causing potential downtime or an outage, so we won't do it." 
---
Doesn't matter if the original dev(s) is still there or not.
---
Ascended gear offers statistical advantages over exotic and infusion slots that are necessary to run high level fractals at all.
---
Not unless there's an API endpoint for it. How is that page updated? Manually?
---
True, I haven't been able to play since the patch, though.
---
I think it’s in the api. Since the gw2bot also makes note of it
---
More or less. I mean that's an extremely simplified description as it's probably more akin to the risk/cost ratio factors in likelihood of an outage or downtime to perform the changes.... and anything that changes existing DB relationships to enable functionality, especially important DB relationships (like inventory), increases the chance that there would be required downtime to deploy and/or increases the risk associated with a possible outage (I.E. breaking character inventories, for example).
---
I don't swap them on an equipped item. I 1st swap it into my inventory by equipping another item and switch the sigils on my inventory, this takes about 5 seconds for me. But I don't really get what you're going after.
---
Yes. But lets say for example I have full leggy armour and weapons. Theres nothing stopping me use build templates, not put equipment in template and change stats and runes manually as before from my hero panel?
---
Unless of course your char cannot hold weapons are wear armour from its existing panel any more and if so that fucking sucks
---
Surely I cant be forced to use the equipment slots instead of my bags etc?
---
AFAIK the achievement is close to borderline impossible if you do it by yourself. If you bring someone, they can buff your attacks and even fire attacks of their own (but timing will be crucial)
---
That's why I said even assuming everything were unlimited. In the hypothetical situation where everything is unlimited in terms of slots, the official version offers more unique features. But I doubt it would matter because it isn't free and doesn't have a loyal following compared to the third party alternative.
---
I doubt it :')
---
&gt;There is nothing stopping someone from building a tool for managing your build templates on your computer. It should be trivial to build something that can save and load them for you, probably in just a few clicks.
---
That's exactly ArcDPS there
---
&gt;If they actually take down arcdps, I'll personally probably persue getting an open source tool for this made
---
I've heard deltaconnected said that ANet only let him develop all his stuff until they released their own build templates. That's a very shady move by them and who knows what could've happened to Build Templates and ArcDPS if he refused to step down from Build Templates after ANet's official release was online. We'd probably be left without both his Build Templates and his ArcDPS add-ons and whoever tried using it would get banned. At least him stepping down allows us to maintain ArcDPS with us.
---
If you pursue to create an open source tool that competes with their current monetized system, you'd very likely see yourself banned and maybe receiving a lawsuit for it
---
&gt;I'm thinking they may be worried about what happens if the guy running arcdps stops. If he stops updating, even for a few months, the whole tool is gone for that whole time unless he can hand it off first. Anet building their own tool means that disaster can't happen, and the life of raids is in their hands, not someone else's.
---
They did it to monetize it, that's more than obvious. Character-bound and a very limited nubmber of template slots (both free and paid)? They want to sell both Build Template extra-slots + extra character slots + everything that comes with a new character: bag inventory slots, lvl 80 booster, et cetera.
---
Anyone that used a single character (like OP's example) and the current Build Templates with more than 6 saved builds will now have to create a new character or go through the hassle of having a couple builds being changed manually.
---
At first I partially understood their decision. Actually, I still do understand it, but in hindsight and with more detailed information of how it will work, I strongly disagree. Their handle of deltaconnected's Build Templates is scummy at best, their current release is low-effort/amateurish at best and disgustingly greedy at worst.
---
If I was fond of their game and wanted it to last even though I was growing tired and played basically for raids, after this release I'll probably only log in and play if a friend invites me to a raid. Aside from that, I'll just stop playing and supporting them with any kind of money
---
I purchased the new Charr Tank decoration token for my guild hall but the item will not 'consume' on use and is not deposited into guild storage. I've tried to use it on different characters, logging out and in, and storing it in my bank and withdrawing it but nothing fixes the issue. All this was done while repped with decoration privileges
---
Anyone have any suggestions or do I need to submit a support request? 500 hatched chilis was a significant grind...
---
We all knew that ArcTemplates will be gone the second official thing will drop.
---
What we didn't anticipate, was the piss poor job ArenaNet did about these templates in comparison to what a single guy did by himself in his basement.
---
I have no problem paying for QoL features, but this current iteration of the system is hardly a quality of life.
---
&gt; equipping item effectively destroy it from your inventory and creates exact copy in your equipment
---
I hope you misunderstood, because this is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen, if ANet really made it like this
---
Scourges have disappeared since the patch so that's one annoyance off the list
---
Possibly because they wanted people without the Draconis Mons Mastery or a Skyscale (or the story step for them) to be able to get map completion.
---
Lol I've been racking my brain, trying to think of a reply to this; it's gone from a sincere response all the way to a sarcastic one that implements examples and metaphors but I genuinely can't figure out which one is the most appropriate and which one you won't misconstrue because this is absolutely the dumbest thing I've ever read on this subreddit.
---
In any case, your entire logic is built on a false equivalency. Like a super-duper falsity to the point that it's unbelievable. Maybe it's a matter of semantics and relevant isn't the word that properly conveys your thoughts so I'll leave you to that.
---
Well when reading his tweet, I only see the structure: Reason, consequence, conclusion. No threat or anything. He's tweeting to his followers, not doing a reddit thread or a video talking directly to Anet. Deroir made 1 legendary armor and legendary weapons for each class, he invested a lot in the game, because he loves theorycrafting and adjusting his builds to his convenience (which ArcDPS lets him do easily). It's going to be discontinued and Anet's feature doesn't convince him because of the limitations, so he may just be dropping the game and informing his followers. I don't see how he could have delivered this better (he even made a thread under the tweet linked here explaining his discontentment, and there's not a single word approaching a threat in what he says).
---
Ok.
---
If you hit a full burst on mirage as a condi daredevil, there's nothing they can do to survive it.
---
Another wonderful and interactive spec that one.
---
Yeah even in a group, those guys are really tough to bring down.  If you ever get an item called "Encoded Orders" (I think they just drop from all enemies in Kryta maps), you can bring it to an NPC in Divinity's Reach that will assign you to kill one of the bounty targets for a reward. I don't think it's very common for people to group up and run them anymore, but every once in a while I'll come across a fight in progress.
---
Play a daredevil. Easy to gear (power precision ferocity and a little vitality) and super f'n strong. Staff for most situations and dual pistols when you need cc or dont want to get close.
---
ok but how would this feature be monetized? as it need to be to be even on the table
---
But the thing is, they know the remaining paying playerbase will buy *anything*. Doesn't matter how low-effort it is. They'll be all "But I want to support ANet so I'll buy it", and hence there's no incentive for the devs to invest effort into the things sold on the gem store, **nevermind** adding actually meaningful ingame rewards to indirectly add incentive to then broaden via the gemstore.
---
Because your comment is a typical bro comment that only dudebros find funny. To add on to that, it's not even a very creative way of saying the same tired old  dudebro comment: "I'll give her my wiener and it will be so big she will fall in love with it".
---
Whatever you say MLG pro sponsored by Mountain Dew, hardcore gamer. You forgot to tip your fedora.
---
I agree that it does have negative effects on the value of legendary gear, but I don't know what they can do about that. I'm pretty sure I saw a post around where people were discussing how this system could compensate for that, and... there isn't an easy solution if you operate under the assumption that equipment templates *have* to store gear.
---
What do we do with this problem and knowledge, I don't know. Hopefully anet can respond to this sometime relatively soon. Hopefully they respond to that specific issue at all.
---
&gt;100 bucks
---
Double that. Plus me buying gems with gold, means someone else is buying gems, and selling them for gold. Even "f2p" players are important for the game's health.
---
&gt;Compare this to anything else you do in life. 
---
No? How about we compare it to other games, since that would actually make sense? I have bought games for 10 bucks and played them for hundreds of hours. There are options.
---
I did not play 7 years straight, I probably would've spent less if I could pay a sub for everything, since I usually take long breaks. 
---
&gt;This notion which some community members are pushing right now; build templates should be free, is retarded. Please stop.
---
Currently build templates ARE FREE. How is wanting it to stay that way a "retarded notion"?
---
&gt;Also, who said Arc will be disabled?
---
It will no longer be updated, so it'll stop working as soon as the in game build templates are released
---
Translation: stop using actual logical arguments in such an abrasive manner, invalidating illogical arguments - let me whine and cry in peace...and join us in our illogical whining, or eat our downvotes.
---
short version is that i was in a raid training guild and so were they. I had gone through some tough stuff earlier in my life and they were goong through right then. One night after a training group they asked if i could stay for a bit after and talk, so i did. the next week they sent me a message saying that they were taking a break a gw2 and games in general and that they decided to not take their own life because of that talk the week priior. This is a very summarized version of the events, but if i go into more detail the. i would be sharing personal stuff which i am not confortable doing.
---
Which version?  Sd or dd?
---
&gt;I think giving everyone 5 to start, and the ability to unlock 10 to 15  would be a smart move. The players that are REALLY specialized would be  willing to shell out the money for 15 templates.
---
Looking at it through my Dev/Admin lens, the main reason I can think of that they may be adding this limitation has to do with Database performance. Each Gear template and Build template are (probably) stored in their own tables and linking to the player character through a DB relationship. Similar with the a Build Storage table and a Player Account table.
---
The performance impact of this release cannot be fully tested at scale until actual launch, so they are going to launch as-is, monitor performance and see how the player base as a whole responds.
---
One important note would be that adding more "resources" to the database nodes/servers/system won't necessarily be able to account for all potential performance considerations. The DB "Performance" encapsulates network congestion, network latency, Database performance, CPU performance, memory use, Disk I/O, and replication. That's what I can think of, but I know there's more that goes into that as well.
---
Yeah but I know that if anet listens to this suggestion (about adding the items to the vendor) then the prices would be high. This is not what ppl desire. They should instead create a way that takes some time but is not bound to creating another sinkhole for money (gold). I mean cmon we want to play the game and not just mindlessly grind gold all the time just to finish it (maybe) before the next patch just to start over again...
---
Of all their fourselves I guess?
---
I mean...good.  fuck Charr.
---
Try tangled deep. You won't believe what a wonderful world is up there
---
Never said the majority of the population wouldn't enjoy templates. I think most players will like it. I think most of the population doesn't need 16 templates per character, I wager a good number of them may only buy 1 at most of each template type (per character which could mean 5 times over the course of a couple years), if that. I just said the majority doesn't use arcdps, those are different arguments. There are people who wanted templates but didn't use arcdps. Like I said, this is for 1% of the population. That's how free to play games work. They try to find niches for each type of player. Some players want templates but don't care about a new chair. Some players want a new chair but don't care about new templates. That is a reason to charge for both, not a reason to charge for neither. They aren't going for EVERY player with EVERY item in the store, they are going for niches... they have one with templates. For the average player it's a nice to have feature that adds to the game, or a hardcore player, they are going to need to buy into it to maintain their templates the way they want.
---
ideally you don't lose people but it's not an ideal world and people leave because they feel slighted even if they weren't. This goes to the debate of Netflix (or any service for that matter) raising the price of their service. There is a valid calculation that occurs in which they figure out how many people will leave due to the raise. Ideally, no one leaves, but realistically people leave all the time for all sorts of reasons, and yes a price increase is one of those... but it's the company's prerogative to say "hey, we either raise the price an amount that we can or we just file for bankruptcy." It's the user's prerogative to say "that price is too steep" and leave. But there is a definite value in staying open even it means losing those who feel the price is too steep. You argue that it's bad for the game to lose people, I agree... but the game loses more people if there is no game.
---
I think if we frame the argument to say "hey, we want templates, but what you are offering isn't giving us the value we want, here is something that could offer us more value while allowing you to continue to monetize" that's how we should talk about it. We need value, they need money. If templates as it is, has little value to us, we need to describe what features would bring more value with allowing them to continue monetizing. What is it from this thing that we don't have that arcdps had other than "free"? Which means to remove verbiage like "unlimited" or "free" from our vernacular and just concentrate on the features we'd like to see.... free isn't really a feature, it's a cost.
---
SD of course, DD is a meme
---
i solo-ed this achievement and the main thing is acquiring targets as soon as targeting becomes available which means always facing the camera towards kralk.  iirc the camera has a tendency to face away from kralk as aurene is moving around the wings and i think over/under which might lose you some firing time if you don't manually rotate the camera to maintain line of sight.  Fire each shot as it recharges and change targets immediately after you've fired at a target twice.  The shots take a while to hit so change targets right after you fire the second shot, it's fire and forget as long as line of sight isn't affected during the shot.  Also don't be afraid to use mouse targeting if you can't target the next closest target in the line fast enough.
---
yep and they are still able to put  3 different color filters on one map.
---
1060 for me could run 60fps 4K max settings.
---
You'll get frame drops in cities/mobs no matter what until cpu's are 6-7 ghz
---
Even my 3800X/2080Ti desktop can't keep up with 60 fps in some areas.
---
My Ryzen APU laptop with 8 vega cores can push 60fps in most areas but also falters in mobs.
---
Damn, that's embarrassing.
---
The technology isn't there yet.
---
Yes, the “abrasive manner” bit.
---
&gt; More like Massively et al only ever talk about GW2 when Reddit gets worked up over something
---
Did you read any of the PvP columns? Not to mention the weekly coverage with the Flameseeker Chronicles
---
Honestly, being a dream of a dragon would be awesome. Could potentially wake up for an instance and be a dragon for a while. Maybe we have been Steve all along.
---
Funny thing too.. after seeing that guy add it all up, the cost for all the templates his Mesmer will need is approximately one mount skin.
---
One mount skin’s worth of gems.  That’s what raiders are crying over.
---
Really puts it into perspective!
---
When the release date was announced. 
---
Colin kept teasing about "when it's ready" so it was a real shocker having an actual date and a super cool trailer. I think it was June or August, I'm not really sure, what I do remember is daydreaming about it every day for a week. The art style was amazing, the maps where huge and the classes seemed so agile and mobile in comparison to other games where it feels like controlling a robot.
---
By the end of that week I wasn't getting any of my work done so I tried to forget about it and get back to reality only to notice how unhappy I was with my job, with my life, with everything. At that time I was living with a relative, no gf, no kids and only happy when thinking of gw2, so after some pondering I said "fuck it" and wrote a letter stating my intention to resign "for personal reasons". The deadline was, of course, a couple of days before game release in order to keep myself busy and not die of anxiety waiting. I also needed the extra money to add to my savings.
---
So yeah, I quit my job for a video game. 
---
I played non stop for a couple of months before searching for a new job. Today I'm happier, living alone, plans to move on with my gf and our son, and gw2 keeps being a part of my life though I don't play as often as before. Thanks Arenanet!
---
So, they're taking in consideration a third party program wich shouldn't be allowed (but Anet just says "use at your own risk") with a safer in-game feature? that's even more confusiong to me.
---
Also wasn't Arcdps template system famous for randomly deleting equipments?
---
god bless duckduckgo and it's retarded results, I love it
---
So, they're comparing to a 3rd party program (with whould be illegal,but Aned said "use at your own risk") wich was famous for randomly delete equipment? Now I'm even more confused...
---
Where can I find updated presets to use with ReShade? I found this old thread ([https://www.reddit.com/r/WoodenPotatoes/comments/6xa734/giveaway\_and\_megathread\_guild\_wars\_2reshade\_30/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoodenPotatoes/comments/6xa734/giveaway_and_megathread_guild_wars_2reshade_30/)) that had a lot of cool ones but I could not got them to work with the current version of ReShade as they were created for an older build. 
---
I would be using GW2Hook instead but as far as I understood, there is currently no way to use it in combination with ArcDPS, Radial, and D912pxy?
---
Well, I had gotten her to play a little bit a few months ago but we stopped playing for some reason. I think it's because the free to play version of the game was too limiting. When the game went on sale recently (both expansions for one price) I bought it for her account and then we immediately went after getting mounts and gliding for her character. 
---
Having mounts and gliding in the starter zones makes them really easy but also really fun for someone new like her. She's always liked games where you could put a lot of time in and do completionist type things as long as they weren't too difficult. So, the mounts and glider have been instrumental in getting her acclimated to the game where otherwise it was just difficult enough to be off-putting for her. Now, she can go to a new zone and complete it without my help at all. She's also really getting into the fashion, dyes, etc. of the game.
---
Overall though, to answer your question, it was just a gradual process of finding things we both enjoyed and then playing them together. She was always a person who played games just not this type of game. I don't even know where you would begin with someone who doesn't play games.

Almost there, keep going.

I'm not hardcore at all and I find charging for Build Templates to be bullshit.

---
I always enjoy both. I think she'll like them both as well although I imagine I'll be doing the clock tower on both accounts which will make me ornery as usual. Halloween is typically just the last 2 weeks of the month right?
---
What I find shocking is that people were expecting to be able to keep 20 different templates for free. It was pretty obvious to anyone who stopped to think even for a second that this would be monetized. 
---
People keep blaming the lack of a new expansion, but it would have been monetized even if it was released as part of an expansion, because that's the business model, monetizing vanity and convenience. 
---
I do hope they expand the upper limit for those with many builds, but those who expected them for free are kinda playing the wrong game.
---
Making builds is not harcore. Min-maxing is.
---
Because we've had unlimited slots for free up until this. This is like giving someone free unlimited candy and then a year later when they're used to it, take it away, give 2 back and charge an arm and a leg for 4 more.
---
WHAT YEAR IS IT?
---
Yeah, it's called environmental lighting.
---
Funny enough, that effect is natural on Sylvari. This wasn't always the case on all the other races. I remember playing a human in a dark area and her skin would darken just as the armor did but Sylvari never did since they're naturally bio-luminescent.
---
Impressive time. I surely would have needed double the amount of time!
---
It's worse than useless because along with this useless version, the working 3rd party version will get shafted.
---
Certain painting software just has a "persistent" tickbox next to tools. You can make changes, but once you switch out of the tool or close the app, it reverts to the previously "locked" settings.
---
That's what happened to me as well a few months ago. And even those 2 other skins grew on me over time.
---
Indeed. While people like to dismiss arguments as mere "semantics", if you do not start with semantics we'll be wasting our time arguing. 
---
First things first, we have to give different names for different things.  This is mostly arbitrary, so it has to be done at the start of a conversation. The names I like to use are "Templates" and "Loadouts".
---
######Templates  
---
A "build template" is like a blueprint of a build. If you store specifics, then it's not a blueprint, it's the result. 
---
You could also call them something like "blueprint", "prototype", "design", "archetype", etc. 
---
The idea is that a template is something you can share because it exists independently of characters. So it should be possible to add codes in build-sharing sites like Metabattle and GW2Skills to produce the code for those templates.  
---
######Loadouts  
---
This is the build once it's prepared in a character with the gear.  
---
You could also refer to them with names like "preset".  
---
A loadout doesn't exist without the specific gear. 
---
Lots of people use "template" for templates or loadouts indistinctly, and so they get nowhere when arguing about them because they are actually talking about different things.  
---
GW2 is not going to get Build templates or Build loadouts. It's going to get half and half: "skill and trait templates" that we can share for others to load, and "equipment loadouts" with ready-made gear that we can swap.
---
This is bad because we won't really be able to share builds with others. Only parts of them.  
---
GW2's builds include stats and upgrades. This is not like GW1 in which you could pull many builds with considerable changes in the gear and upgrades. They would be slightly less effective, but they would work mostly the same, except for a very small list of farming and speed clear builds.  If you bring a +1 fire  rune instead a +3, the DPS loss won't negligible, but it won't be abysmal either.    
---
In GW2 the changes in gear make stats and upgrades affect massively the performance of the build.  
---
There's no freaking way to do nearly the same things with the same effectiveness with Minstrel gear, Berserker gear and Trailblazer gear. The difference in healing, power and condi numbers would be HUGE. 
---
And many upgrades completely change the behavior of skills, like many rune 6th effects.  
---
It's just not possible to have "Build templates" without them including gear and upgrades, yet we are not getting that.  
---
PvP templates are going to be delayed, and for PvP it will probably be full actual templates, including stats and upgrades.  
---
Hopefully ANet will eventually realize this introduce an actual template system with unlimited entries stored in the disk like in GW1, and create a system to unlock stats and upgrades and load them up in our gear that doesn't expect all players to make legendary gear for every freaking character in the account.
---
You’re going to play it off like it doesn’t bother you or apply to you but it’s going to keep you up at night and then the existential dread will seep in when you realize that I’m right, and that you’re never going to amount to anything because you’re addicted to MMOs and you’ve never had a job that pays more than minimum wage. 
---
You’re going to say something like “at least you tried bud.” But you and I both know that long after I’ve completely forgotten about you, you’ll still be thinking about how I pretty much described exactly how pathetic you are. 
---
If it’s any consolation, at least you felt confident and like I was the one making a fool of myself the whole time, even though nobody reads this deep into comment chains because literally nothing interesting happens this deep into a thread. Just two people going back and forth about shit that doesn’t matter.
---
&gt;Yes that is what I will probably have to do but it is still a strict downgrade from the current functionality. Choosing between having my weapons accessible or having my weapons also switch with my templates seems very redundant.
---
I didn't even realize this. If I feel like screwing around the open world with a different weapon or slight variations of some other build, it will override those? So you have to take care to return everything to it's original state? That's really shit.
---
What a shitshow. Again.
---
bit of a nitpick here, but initially legendary weapons did not have the option to stat swap or even be reskinned (pre-wardrobe) and were definitely meant as a vanity item
---
Meanwhile McLeod remains silent...

Different people like different things. Some people really want to throw away their money on the game to look good. Others want to earn skins as content rewards. Both people can play GW2.

No

Maybe it'll just be a longer process for you to get him to the point where he'll share your interests. Hope it doesn't take you over 20 years. :)
---
I'm not raiding anymore though and I have enough LI and KP to get into any group.
---
And you should be able to unlock at least a few free ball skins with different dye patterns in-game. 
---
And there should be more than balls. Cubes and tetrahedrons are cool too.
---
&gt; Since shade skills trigger off of the Necromancer when there aren't any shades around and due to the way the combat system works in this game, you're always going to want to be within melee range of other players and the mob. What's the point of Shades now? 
---
Kiting Qadim 2.
---
I think this should be called "The difference between lighting on armor and lighting on character's skin"
---
It's like this charr is a light source on his own
---
Cool. Now learn to format the text.
---
I think part of the problem is that they don't really have a variety of development cycle techniques. There are some things that absolutely should stay under wraps until release: story-relevant content, "surprise!" and discovery moments like the Griffon, hype-building things that should be rolled out slowly like new expansions, etc.
---
Big QoL features really shouldn't be treated the same. Introducing a feature and getting feedback about it a few weeks before it launches really doesn't give enough dev/QA time to make large tweaks.
---
People keeps forgetting that the ones that say things like "Shut up and take my money" are rarely the same ones who say things like "There are absolutely no in-game rewards at all whatsoever in any shape or form" or "pREdaTory mOnEtIZatIoN".
---
When there's overlap, it's players who expected lower prices, or players in countries where there's less average purchasing power.
---
Which means one thing, and only one thing: Universal basic income has to be made truly universal, for every human on Earth.
---
And how are the going to offset the loss of income from all the players they cant retain because they have decided to heavily monetize a feature they should have implemented at launch in a way that is inferior (more limited) to and replacing the functionality that has been offered by a hack that a player wrote?
---
Smol pp
---
As it currently stands the fix to this problem, I assume, would be to make two identical builds in two template slots. The first *never* gets touched, the second is used for niche edits. 
---
The problem with *this* is that we shouldn't have to do extra work to create QoL for ourselves when this is meant to be a "QoL" update. Also, it would use up 33% of the total allotted slots for 1 single build.
---
Snowcrows for raid builds, discretize for fractal builds

That being said, we just had a balance patch this week, so new benchmarks are being made still

YUP. I know this sub hasn't always been the most positive of places when it comes to criticisms for GW2 and is kinda known for being "whiney", but I've felt more and more recently myself that the game just seems to have lost its creative direction—and I haven't even been on this sub very much recently at all.
---
It just feels like they're really not trying any more and it's really sad because I used to be able to get friends to play this and we'd enjoy it, whereas now I'm sat there trying so hard to justify shady things to friends after they've asked, and I can't even justify it to myself.
---
usually halloween bleeds a bit into november just like how wintersday bleeds into january, roughly 2 weeks for each i think.  there'll be ample time for you two to get through everything at a relaxed pace.

18 teams for raiding tournament? Where will you find them?
---
&gt; So why is everyone upset
---
Because this is reddit.
---
I barely notice the change at all, after all you could cast all your shade skills on the necromancer even before the patch, the only thing that's changes is, you no longer split you shade skills effect between shades and scourge. My overall gameplay isn't changed in the slightlest.
---
It is irrelevant whether I do it in an abrasive manner or not; majority of the people do not like to know they're wrong in their argument, be pointed out they're illogical, or forced to think harder about their position...especially in the internet.
---
Any kind of conflicting opinion/argument/point of view (regardless of the factuality or relevance) is, and will always be, met with hostility. Ie: in the context of reddit, downvote immediately, reply without actual thought, and move on.
---
slow there... never tell reddit you were lucky on uneven days

&gt; You seem to be missing the point about how he currently manages his existing gear and builds. He's currently using a mod that can swap between dozens of trait and gear combinations with the click of a button.
---
So he has *dozens* of sets of gear just sitting in his inventory at all times? At least with this new system you can put that gear into templates that also free up that inventory space.
---
Whats the expected loss estimation?
---
Doesn't seem like it should be intended. Shroud 5 should still trigger your shroud on you without a hade.... now that you mention it... if you do have one out, does that mean you don't get a shroud anymore?
---
i havent even logged in in like a month... this is hilarious
---
&gt; In the latter two of the three you'd always have your inventory open to use consumables all of the time.
---
Read my other comment(s) below.
---
I am well aware of what the "hardcore community" and "top tier players" do, because...this will shock a lot of you...I am part of it. I just use a different name in Reddit, because I don't need more people whispering me in game.
---
I simply don't play favouritism and am usually very critical in my thinking. I also generally hold my thoughts on thing(s) that we lack information on, until I see/experience said thing(s) myself: in this case, the build template, which we still lack full information on in regards to the intricacies involved in the system.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-selection_bias
---
The main concern regarding build templates isn't the monetization, it's the amount you can have. Having the option to only store 6 builds on a mesmer is an absolute joke. Nobody who wanted build templates cared about the storage of the items. All they wanted is the option to quickly swap between builds, traits and skills - just like what we're used to from arcdps build templates.
---
It's understandable that delta has to shut down arcdps build templates as soon as the official ones are released but both formats fulfill a different purpose. Arcdps doesn't store your equipment in some kind of extra inventory space, all it does is swap things around. The official templates also get rid of some by equipment occupied inventory space. Granted, that's nice to have but not if you have to sacrifice build diversity that way.
---
Very well said.
---
&gt;The 24 limit was described in the stream as being because when they put the number higher things got unstable. They didn't go into more detail than that, but it sounds like it was doing more than just losing items for some reason. I can't think of a data reason for this, but I can't see their code.
---
You don't have to see their code to know this is utter bullshit.
---
Sometimes u have to talk to the NPCs to initiate the quest
---
I believe you're now intended to put a shade in your target and one in yourself while at range, which I think is OK. It adds skill and strategy to the class.
---
This change hurts because we're used to the previous version, which was powerful, but I believe it's healthy to the game in the long run.
---
It works correct with shade but does nothing (except visuals) without one.
---
I am not affected enough to complain about the issue but I'm not convinced with the "think about the poor shareholders" arguments.
---
Whoever calls the shots on monetization (Anet or NCSOFT) and whoever makes the systems has the responsibility for making sure what they do is profitable. 
---
If it's a bad idea then in discussions I'll say that something is a bad idea. I'm not going to argue they deserve a return on investment because nothing in the consumer markets should work like that. 
---
Build template current iteration seems like a downgrade for some users and they are annoyed. Anet hasn't set expectations properly or designed a good solution, OR maybe they knew what the response would be and they didn't care because they would make more money than they'd lose from the few people who wouldn't continue spending. 
---
In the end monetization and providing services/products is a business issue so there's no point in commenting on whether it'll be profitable or not, that's not what I as the consumer can or will bother trying to do.
---
&gt;unlimited slots for free
---
Wait what?  Are you talking about a third-party mod solution?
---
&gt; \- it's just the thing that tend to forget do do things "at the end of session" and constantly needing to update my template every time when I make small change would be annoying in long run.
---
Isn't this more egregious in the "template = current loadout" scenario we currently have as oppossed to having an "apply" button to save the build? Say you have template #1. You want to switch a few things to test whatever you want. After you are done testing, you need to do things "at the end of the session" to revert to your previous loadout, and as is the case when testing stuff, you'll most likely want to revert your changes as oppossed to keeping them most of the time (wouldn't be testing otherwise, right?)
---
same as the OP estimated
---
&gt; [Massively] Here’s why the Guild Wars 2 community is grumpy over build templates.
---
Who says? Sure, the most vocal people are currently unhappy about the announced build templates. But those are only the ones you hear. Someone is always unhappy about something, and they tend to be the noisy ones. It's hard to judge how many are actually happy and/or just waiting to try the templates once they are in-game. It's hard because they tend to be quiet. That doesn't mean they are not part of the GW2 community or only a small part.
---
What is the monetary motivation of putting an upper limit to the number of things you can buy?
---
I don't change builds very often and don't use third party tools so the official build templates are nothing but a good thing for me right? Is there any reason I should be concerned?
---
Game engine is really fucking old, man. Usually I'd shit on that fact and the developer, but in this case it's a good thing, I think. The fact that it's a victorian era engine makes it so it will run on anything, just badly. "Shit FPS because Grug Engine bad" is better than "No FPS because game no run". I can pull out my piece of shit 10 years old laptop, and can still experience the same amount of FPS as state of the art NASA array while farming Istan. Not only death, but GW2 as well equalizes people.
---
I like this. Give us build and gear templates. Add an Account-Wide armory (that we pay for extra slots) that you can store ascended gear on that all characters can access for the gear templates.
---
I'm getting really sick of these pve "patches" ruining the game for natural explorers. The mounts are already restricted to interact with terrain, and they aren't fixing anything by further restricting the pve playable areas.
---
monetized build templates is not gonna be how to make a massive profit
---
Honestly this is a good change - it makes the class a lot less confusing and easier to play. Don't overthink it.
---
Yeah, I mean it was also just a survey of around 100 players on the official forums, hardly indicative of anything really.
---
If charging for slots is "nickel-and-diming," haven't they been doing that the whole time?
---
They have to charge for something, or the game will not exist. Is not charging for slots better than loot boxes or pay-to-win?
---
Once again people willfully miss the point.
---
It's not about monitization.  Most people would be fine paying for a feature that was actively effective.  It's the fact they took an idea and a feature then went out of thier way to make that idea less functional and limited to get more money out of people.  Most notably thier long time and hard core players that would have the most benifit of this feature.
---
They went out of thier way to implement components of trmplates that made it more complicated and limited than it had to be. Not only did this diminish the original idea of templates they did it for the sole reason for justification and to piece meal it out.
---
Nobody asked for extra storage to put our gear in.  They did this all on thier own so they can argue the price.  We already have means to expand our storage. 
---
What we needed is a way to load gear from our inventory onto our characters with a build, that isn't severely limited, and required the chore of unequipping builds from templates to use account bound gear on other characters.
---
I would have gladly paid upwards of 2000 gems for this feature, stored the builds locally, and not be restricted on how many I could make much like GW1.  For how it will be now.  I will pay nothing.  I'll store my builds on a note pad and move gear around from character to character like we did before arc because I will have to do that with me legendary gear regardless of how many equipment templates I own.
---
They are also comparing to what they had 7 years ago in gw1.
---
And no, arcdps doesn't delete gear.  That was a disclaimer the developer put out just as a basic cover-all warning.  I've been using it for a long time.  4 sets of legendary, 30 sets of ascended, nothing has ever been deleted.
---
few months ago, there was a lot of talking about at LA aerodrome; not sure if was people just spreading lies, but there was lot of Arcdps updates in that period.
---
Anyway ppl using it now says it's safe, still, i don't trust 3rd party programs XP
---
They could also make it so they only have 1 shade at any given time, but they can move it around like with the Ventari Tablet. 
---
Using F1 again would move the shade and have an effect in its path, like crippling enemies and giving a bit of barrier to allies.
---
They could also make the skill consider channeling time like the SAB bombs. Tap F1, and you move the shade, hold F1 for longer than 1s, and the Shade is removed instead moving.  
---
Or the shade could disperse when using one or more of the F2-F5 skills, or an specific one of them, instead after a certain a mount of time. The UI element with the 3 diamonds for the 3 shades could be replaced with 4 diamonds for 4 shade skill uses, then the shade breaks and has to be reapplied. 
---
Or the shade skill could flip over to a second skill once all 3 ammo is depleted, this skill would relocate the oldest shade without causing any extra effects, until the ammo goes back to 1 or more.
---
Yeah that case, but did you read the comments?
---
You shouldn't be too concerned, no.  The only issue will be that your build won't automatically swap to a different one in WvW anymore, your WvW build will become one of the three build templates your character gets by default.  So you just need to push a button to swap builds when you go there.  They haven't figured out how to integrate PvP into the system yet because things work differently there.
---
But overall, if you don't use ArcDPS, you aren't going to be losing anything.  If you have multiple equipment sets, the extra gear template you get will save you inventory space, in fact, as your extra gear will be stored in the template rather than in your bags.
---
no, arcdps doesn't delete gear. That was a disclaimer the developer put out just as a basic cover-all warning. I've been using it for a long time. 4 sets of legendary, 30 sets of ascended, nothing has ever been deleted.
---
I find it helps my mind set a lot to try and give opponents credit where it is due as well. If someone absolutely murders you in a couple seconds, thinking "wow that guy is a lot better than me!" can be a less tilting than "ugh so unfair how could I lose?"
---
At least I find that helps me! Once you notice someone is a lot better you can focus on practicing against them each fight too. Even in a losing game you can get a lot of practice trying to do better against those you are struggling against.
---
I do not believe that GW2 has ever made a massive profit. That said, it does still need to make SOME profit to exist, correct?
---
Me: Can I have that chair?
---
ANet: We have chairs at home.
---
Chairs at home:
---
Spot on about the assessment that the support players are the glue that holds raid groups together generally and are hit hardest by this. As someone with a dozen builds and who leads a raid group, I can say with certainty these build templates do not feel good and are pushing me away from the game. If I end up deciding to leave, as you mentioned, I can guarantee the raid group would fall apart and also guarantee that half of that group would entirely stop raiding/logging in all together. This is a potentially big blow to the game in general. 
---
I’ve already had two people from my raid group quit the game entirely due to the major incompetence of Anet due to Strikes being a joke and now this issue.
---
Even if they remove the templates functionality will arcdps still be allowed to keep track of dps? anyone know if the creator will cease creating updates for arcdps?
---
Yes I agree. Lets just hope we can still do it the old fashioned way after launch lol
---
What did you like about playing Chrono? That could help people recommend things for you.
---
It's super busted. I can see how it's a scary one to touch for Anet though because it kind of makes mirage what it is at this point. Mirage is a lot less fun without it.
---
I personally think they need to bite the bullet and delete it or severely limit it somehow.
---
It's doable solo.  Aurene can only fire in front of her, and it takes three shots to destroy a weak point.  When they become vulnerable, you need to pick one to destroy and shoot it three times, then after the third shot is fired target a new weak point and shoot it three times too.
---
The challenge in doing it solo is taking Aurene's movement into account.  If you only have time to shoot a weak point twice and then it's behind Aurene, those are two wasted shots.  You have to target weak points that are a bit farther away from her as a result, so you have enough time to destroy them.  Once you figure that out, you'll be able to get it done.  There's more than enough weak points, you just need to avoid shooting ones that are too close to actually finish.
---
(It might take two shots instead of three, I don't remember exactly, so find that out)
---
I don't think that 6 and 24 are the right numbers for that, but I'll say your explanation and mine are, in my opinion, both equally just gut feelings about the situation, and neither is clearly right.
---
Thread removed: Do not use this subreddit to try and contact the customer support.

It's not a basic feature, it's convenience that isn't necessary. It saves time. The game has a "pay for cosmetics and convenience" business model. If you're a veteran player you should know this, because convenience has been in the cash shop ever since it existed.
---
Huh, entry fees? Who’s gonna keep those safe?
---
About the fact that it may not be happened but was a warning that it could? I still don't trust 3rd party programs \^\^
---
unless the boss moves.  Then your pretty screwed.  Unfortunately, one of the bosses that scourge is really good at is sh, which moves a ton.
---
Yeah, teapot was begging on stream for people to enter and he could barely scrape together enough people for his tourney. This league is dead on arrival.
---
Thats so wrong holy moly
---
It was difficult to click on a shade then click on my target, then click on the shade skill
---
Also I was unsure from a lore perspective why a single skill could affect two spots at once
---
Disregarding donations, the winning team in the gold league gets 40g per player for 8 weeks of tryharding. Of course donations could increase that by any amount but that's the baseline.
---
I had the same thought.
---
Also what about the viewers? One wing getting cleared in a squad vs squad side by side view is way more entertaining than looking at logs after one hour.
---
Better for inventory space, I agree. Worse in usefulness because of ArcDPS.
---
I've been playing burn weaver and I'll start in water and earth to bait an opener and act like a support then once they burnt through their stuff, instant 20 burn stacks.
---
The rage and claims of hacking are hilarious.
---
I guess. Personally I feel it pretty useful to have inventory space so both are pretty useful imo.
---
There is not enough slots for that but that would definetly the ideal situation. Even if there was enough template slots available it would be pretty crazy to pay gems for another slot just to have another sigil on it.
---
Other solution would be using several characters but thats just redundant aswell. I have been building several legendaries to conveniently play a single character and now that this supposedly great qol feature is coming Im forced back to using several characters for different things.
---
Just to be clear, I dont hate that build templates are coming, I love it. The trait/utils templates seem very good there just isnt enough slots for some people. 
---
Gear templates on the other hand seem like a pretty big mess and I feel like a lot of utility ive gotten from crafting legendaries is just being replaced by build templates and they are taking a big part of why I crafted them away from me.
---
I mean, you can just store the builds, the same way you did in GW1, locally on your machine and thus have "unlimited" free storage.
---
A thread about build templates, how inventive.
---
I think the simplest solution here would just be to streamline the customization UI to be able to select multiple stat swappable items and change them all at once. People complain about having to change the stat load outs of legendaries manually but that's a problem of Anets own devising.  They made the stat change ui tedious and slow to use. If you could just select all stat swappable items you have equipped, and choose your stat and rune set with two clicks, I bet people wouldn't be complaining.
---
Mesmer is, has been, and shall forever be the No Fun Allowed PvP profession. It’s been that way since the dawn of GW1 and will stay that way until the last franchise server shuts down.
---
Simply put, if the enemy Mesmer is doing their job right then you’re going to be pretty miserable unless you brought a direct counter to them.
---
Ethelwylf! Be playing in 6 hours from now
---
Thing is I’m really unfamiliar with linux and both the transparent rendering and input hooks are not frequently used winapi features that are finicky, so the solution is probably more in the hands of the devs of those projects you’re using, sorry.
---
Thank you somebody that’s reasonable
---
Well yes and no. In GW1 you stored them on your local machine using in game systems still. In GW2's system the only way to do that is to save the chat code and put it into a notepad doc or excel spreadsheet or soemthing which is annoying and clunky.
---
A key is per account.   
---
So if you both want to play together in the expansion, both your accounts need it.
---
I wanted to try an approach to the discussion that I haven't seen yet to try to organize things and promote healthier discourse.
---
I like how you're getting downvotes because the community actually feels that 15 builds per character that you actually use is normal.
---
The point is that you own every stat in the game until the rest of time and can freely swap runes and infusions.
---
 I have legendary raid armor too and I'm upset at the limits on the system as well but there is still some benefit to using the system to hot-swap armor stats with a single button. It technically does enable faster and somewhat more conveniently than Arc did but at the expense of limitations, monetization, and first party programming issues.
---
i think they get locked to an account. You would have to purchase two, one for each account.
---
That is true, the system was able to read the txt-files directly. Not really sure how "annoying and clunky" 10 seconds of copy/pasting would be though.
---
And the 4th place team *loses* 10g per player for participating. Big yikes.
---
I've been playing since around July, finished skyscale around... 2 weeks ago? I enjoyed the collection, everything except the damm inscribed shards farming since I never seemed to find people running that map's meta bc I usually play off-hours. Almost didn't even notice the "daily" timegate since I was busy farming inscribed shard pretty much since I started the collection :(
---
As in [my answer to Zarurra]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dc6v08/why_veterans_are_concerned_with_official_build/f2b2s2k?context=3) I would say that the biggest problem lies with the current customization UI.  If legendaries had an easier and simpler customization system, there wouldn't be a problem. The equipment slots should be for people who have multiple sets of exotic or ascended gear, and maxing your default slots should be an incentive to upgrade to Legendary. A streamlined customization UI that let you change stats and runes on multiple pieces at once would fix all of this.
---
Best of luck to get this started!
---
I was only anwsering why the playerbase has this common sentiment. The built up a part of their playerbase from their first game and as such that portion has certain expectations. Even players who are gw2 exclusive can look back and see that as a better system too.
---
the funniest part is they thought it was a good idea to give "patch notes" for it, drawing even more attention to the scam. they're genuinely stupid
---
Deposit all materials had to be in game from day one for obvious reasons. By sparing people from getting inventory filled with all sorts of junk nearly instantly, ANet still add enough reasons for players to spent money on bank space and other gemstore features.
---
I personally spent lots of gems on bank and extra characters for reasons OP mentioned, at least 40% of my maxed bank filled with armor and weapons.
---
1: This is a terrible justification. If professional game developers cannot create a system better than one hobbyist in their own game, they do not deserve to earn money from the system. They could literally have just copied the functionality of Arc in-game and it would have been preferable. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
2-4: Build templates were a noticable absense at launch, but obviously the game was still worth playing. This however does not mean that the feature was not "missing", and as more endgame content has been added over time build templates have been increasingly necessary for many players. For a live game such as GW2 it is not sufficient that the game remain in the same state as launch - it needs constant improvements in order to maintain its population, who support the game. 
---
Build templates were basically the most-requested feature of the game since day one, and they made a big deal over finally announcing that they were working on them. But then the feature turns out to be a simple cash grab offering barely any functionality for free. The system could still have been monetised through the equipment "banking" feature, without sacrificing core usability, or the free 3rd-party solution could have remained legal for more dedicated players.
---
The free version of the system offers almost nothing of value aside from the "banking" - 6 saved builds account-wide is basically nothing, and the 24-max is patheticly limited for a lot of players. The 3 tabs players have access actually offer LESS functionality than the current system if you play all game modes, as you will have exactly the same functionality (1 build per mode) but without the automatic build swapping between modes.
---

---
Get your hands OFF THAT!
---
...pay attention to me instead... baka...
---
Nope but I run frame limiter at all times .
---
It actually would but that isnt something I have even considered to this point. But that would still mean I dont have access to the weapons from my inventory so actually not really. 
---
To me the preferrable solution would be that the new build templates didnt store my gear. That they worked like arc templates currently do.
---
I'm more than willing to pay for as many  slots as I want, if the price was more reasonable. Or maybe if they were account wide.
---
Lol this reminds me of old Bing memes.
---
there's another thread about it right now but my additional concern is that it would not be easy to make microadjustments on the fly. Since your weapon is now stored in the arsenal inventory, you can't just open your bags to quickly throw on a weapon to your off/main hand for something and then swap back. You have to use the hero menu (the big and bulky one), navigate to character-&gt;equipment-&gt;templates-&gt;arsenal to make the swap to and from. 
---
on top of that, any changes you make are presumably saved live to the template which isn't horrendous to deal with but it would be nice to have a confirming "save" option which allows you to have a baseline build you can freely modify from into different builds. Would be great for duplicating a build which may be similar but has a few key differences (such as fractal vs raid build) or making soft adjustments on the fly for legendary gear (such as chronos who need to fiddle around with toughness + concentration stats). would be great in the limited build options we seem to be getting as well.
---
but basically I just want something at least on par with what arc templates offers, not something lesser than

---
They split balance not functionalities
---
stand somewhere else
---
Now imagine this: The person described has 3 gear slots on his Ele. One has, idk Sword+Dagger, the other has a Staff, the last one has Scepter Warhorn. That means those weapons are saved in the armory.
---
Now for skipping some groups or whatnot, he wants to quickly grab his focus. This focus is in his Inventory, since its not part of any of his templates. For the next part he wants his staff, which he then actually has to grab from the armory. You see how this now requires extra attention.
---
If you've ever watched some solo dungeon speedrun or something you would know how insane those levels of gearswapping mid run can get - even tho his case is really niche, it is a valid approach of the game for some people.
---
why you post this now when reddit is currently fired up about anets build templates, which heavily limits the freedom we had before, while anet expect us to cash out premium money for this inferior system?
---
If the templates themselves were free and unlimited then yes. I would be willing to pay for the storage of gear in the template itself, and for the ability to quick-swap between builds with a keypress. As the system is, I see no reason to spend any money on it as even if I do it still won't provide what I need.
---
25 dollars for a skin is the regular going rate for skins in mmos as far as mount skins go.
---
Free unlimited templates were a thing in the only other game ANet has ever made, too.
---
Soo what are you trying to tell us with that?
---
Thanks for info!
---
There probably goes my get-out-of-combat-and-quickly-swap-build plans. Oh well.
---
Jumbo shade now has a proper trade-off, which it was lacking.
---
In the end, D912pxy did pushed me to 60 Fps
---
take my upvote. same opinion here.
---
So, would you say your main concern is with the system costing money? As in, if both systems were free as is, would you still be upset with it's implementation?
---
if anet didn't nickel and dime me for qol features, *especially* one the ALREADY EXISTS VIA THIRD PARTY (arcdps  is better than the official ones are looking to be on top of everything) and one that should have been included at launch 7 fucking years ago, i'd me a much happier gamer and more inclined to give them my money for skins chairs toys etc.
---
I have not objected to the fact that GW1 templates were developed after release, which is why I tried to make the distinction between GW2's purchase when released and GW1's purchase. I recognize that I didn't do a good job here. Perhaps I have also made a false equivalency when comparing GW1 purchases during 2012 with GW2 purchases during 2012.
---
However, the foundation of my argument is based on objecting to the premise that there was no reason to not include build templates in 2012. This objection relies on the premise that build templates could not have factored into the decision to purchase GW2 in 2012 based on the assumption that build templates were cut from the game to the benefit of other features prior to release. I believe this assumption can be explained logically.
---
just create a system to load your config from .json file stored from your computer to swap traits/skills/gear with gear available in your bag.... They overcomplicated this system to justify charging you money.
---
but imagine how much more money anet could have made by selling bag slots if it wasn't!!!
---
^ this is what the op is saying
---
&gt;Entry fees :
---
will be to 100g / team in both league
---
&gt;Top 3 will won all the gold (3rd 100g / 2nd 200g / 1st all the rest)
---
ERP3 had an enormous prize pool, no entry fee, and still had a hard time finding participants. What makes you think you can do it with an entry fee and comparatively tiny prize pool?
---
I should have clarified that my point of view comes from being a healer Scourge.
---
&gt; Any ideas as to why?
---
This is most likely going to be related to your graphics cards, drivers, and settings. I'd advise you to ask in one of the tech support subreddits as they'd be way better equipped to help you.
---
Make sense. Though I liked having a single giant shade...
---
Couldn't you just have 4 templates for your Ele that uses a range of Ascended gear &amp; then use your Legendary gear for your Mesmer? The whole swapping back &amp; forth made (a bit of) sense when you would have to keep all your sets in your bag/bank, but now they're part of the template slots.
---
That or just make another Legendary set you cheapsake. xD
---
I do have a sense of humor. It was just a shit joke. If he wants people to laugh he should make a good joke. If the audience doesn't laugh, it's the comedian not the audience that failed.
---
Because in maximum a few weeks of playing you will have like 120 Blue Unidentfied, 100 Green Unidentified, 60 Yellow Unidentified gear after half an hour of playing mostly any meta.
---
That's right, it was before the wardrobe. Two items could have their skins swapped, resulting in pretty, bound vanity garbage. Swapping the skins of two items is different than reskinning one item in the wardrobe, that is correct. What made legendary weapons more than vanity items was granting the years-old community request to add stat-swapping functionality. Most of the improvements to this game were requests from its community first.
---
Yep, and at max farming rate (30g/hr) you will take about 59.4 hours of farming to max out based on this posts math for 60 USD needed to max out and 30g/hr converting to about 1.01$/hr. 
---
Assuming you do nothing but farm their content and play two hours a night every night, it will take you a Month to max it out, spending a total of about 1800gold. 
---
Granted, most people don't need to do that, and I imagine vets probably have decent gold reserves so it more of just an unfortunate scenario. I do hope that the devs are much more conservative with their pricing and aim for about 250 gems/tab for equipment and even lower for build tabs (account wide ones can be higher but the per character ones I'd hope are cheaper)
---
Nobody asked for unlimited inventory slots. Nobody asked for this system to have anything to do with inventory space. What people have been asking for is what existed in gw1 and exists in arcDPS, a button that reads a text file and equips items and skills automatically. If they want to sell free storage space on top of that as an added value that's completely fine and i even think that's a good idea but there's no reason the two systems can't be separated.
---
Looks like the bloodred angel from Star Trek Discovery series.
---
This is awesome!!! I hope to be there, if I can wake up and remember to log in on time. :)
---
Yep, like in real life, if you point a colored light to something, that something will be colored too, depending on something's original color and material. Red light makes everything red, blue light makes everything blue. Mind. Blown.
---
Indeed my main concern and disappointment with the feature... Would be fine if they gave us endless slots or made it so the changes wouldn't get saved. The lack of both options is trully bad.
---
Full map markers and minimap markers basically the biggest feature
---
ITT: People who havent played mirage.
---
&gt; The 3 tabs players have access actually offer LESS functionality than the current system if you play all game modes, as you will have exactly the same functionality (1 build per mode) but without the automatic build swapping between modes.
---
didn't think about this one yet. naturally i would think that the system still defaults to the last build you had active in every respective mode... but frankly my hopes for that to actually be the case are rather diminished.
---
Coming from someone who already does this, if you're mixing and matching stats for anything outside of crit chance, boon/condi duration, you're doing it wrong...and if you're planning on using mishmash stats on your tabs, then you don't understand the purpose of equipment tabs in the first place.
---
You're not going to have a zerk weapon on a viper set tab, and suddenly want to use the zerker weapon in your zerk tab; simply put, that's idiotic!
---
Once the template goes live, you'll realize how much of a non-factor this "issue" you're complaining about really is (unless there are some serious intricacies we are unaware of currently)...if you actually know what you're doing. The real issue comes with legendaries...which, let's face it...MOST of you are unaffected by it.
---
Yeah but they fucked that up, didn't they? No need to punish DPS as well. Also, plenty of classes have a DPS and support variant on the same elite spec, so this is not an effective argument.
---
All I can say here is I agree 110% with this post.  While I get there are  a few people that might feel they need 239847345 slots for their super nuanced builds for that one killer llama on path 3 of whatever and nowhere else, the fact still remains that MOST players might not ever need to buy additional slots and if they do it will be for the novelty of it all.  I remember back in GW1 days I had a file with over 30 build templates in there.  Even then I only used maybe 5 of them with any regularity on any given character, and we had WAY more build diversity back then.
---
How to auto-show dailies in right corner of game UI? I'm just coming back to GW2 from being away for some years and tracking dailies seems very difficult now.  When I used to play I would have dailies automatically appear in the user interface in the upper right corner in the Achievements area, however now it seems I have to manually put them there each day.  This is discouraging and seems difficult to track.  Is there a way to get them to automatically appear so that I know which dailies to attack each day I login?
---
They're literally tagged as group events in-game
---
I think people would be happy if they got a salary for playing the game. :P
---
Oh yeah, I'm not saying I love cosmetics either, though I do get that it's just how games like this stay afloat these days.
---
Gw2 is particularly bad about it though, the gem store setup feels like it's at the expense of in-game rewards, the fact that there's no cool mount skins attached to hard achievements or raids is a travesty.
---
At least chair skins have come from raids.
---
I think your point is that you'd like to protest against players more than against ANet.  If you're not afraid to admit that, then you should definitely do what you want others to do: make a youtube video denounce how ignorant players are enabling companies like ANet to exploit themselves.
---
Meanwhile, don't accuse others of "inaction" when voting with our wallet (as not buying whatever ANet is selling) is more valid than bitching about things on Reddit, (and often for the sake of entertainment).
---
I mean, in theory, this idea is great.  In practice you are going to have an extremely difficult time finding teams to participate.  I mean the SC viability competition first 2 months only drew in a handful of teams and the last one only my group entered... ONE SINGLE GROUP.  Those were only 1 boss over about 4-6 weeks as well.
---
Most of the raiding community that cared about speed running have left for FFXIV or just simply quit the game due to Anet not caring one bit about us.  Couple that with the recent build template fiasco and you are going to be hard pressed finding people that want to actually try hard at raids
---
I think they missed a chance to tie at least 1 beetle skin to the race event. Sure, everyone would likely have it, but it'd at least be a skin other than the base. Hell.. Rolling Ace should have given a skin to showcase your effort rather than a scarf and title.
---
I understand, just hoped maybe some info would trigger an epiphany. Thanks anyway :)
---
We can't use legy Armor for multiple equipment slots?
---
I would be OK with these changes if I could get rid of shades on demand. I can adapt my old play style to never cast shades and just move to where I'm needed. But if I forget and put one out at range, I can't do anything useful until it's gone.
---
It's been done. The ERP event was orders of magnitude more popular than anything else I've seen from the game, and anet successfully gave the entire community the silent treatment over a camera hack and in the end it made no difference.
---
Do you think you can do better than that?
---
The reality is Anet has cultivated the perfect majority of consumers who want to buy development-cheap gemstore crap constantly and don't care that much about getting development-expensive content. Those consumers will actively try to remove anyone who DOES want more from the game, while anet can market their rhytlock shoes or whatever and doesn't have to say a thing. It's a win for them.
---
I am using a cheap 60hz display connected via hdmi
---
Good on them for getting Roy to cast english stream. That man is just pure positive wholesome energy.
---
Gear blueprints! Load a blueprint for the loadout. Make it easy to unequip legy armor / ascended armor to switch it over to other toons.
---
&gt; Do you think you can do better than that?
---
I have not said that.
---
My point was that all that bitching on Reddit doesn't seem to help.
---
Any chance I can find this build anywhere? Sounds fun I love weaver
---
easier access and change stats . if u do endgame content 2400 gold are something u can do in 6 months without even trying
---
Ok but who didn't expect loadouts I kinda figured that was more what we were gonna get
---
Yeah just dismiss everyone who doesn't like it with "Lul elitist 1%, games not for you!"
---
&gt;but Massively should also put effort into reporting good things about the game
---
Why? Massively aren't part of the Anet marketing team. What obligation do they have to perform that role for them? Here's the thing, Anet making an easily avoidable mess that annoys their community is news. On the other hand, Anet doing a reasonable job and performing adequately is a reasonable expectation. "Local man goes to work and does his job properly" isn't the basis for a news article. "Local man gets drunk and rams fuel truck into heritage building" is the basis for a news article.
---
15% boon duration from having big shade up
---
It's actually the one on metabattle.  Be warned you are absolutely hard countered by some classes.
---
It's fun for what it is, but it's a 4* build for a reason.  When the matchup is good you're great, but you have to pick your fights and aren't good with team fights as reapers and scourges will just eat you if they're good.
---
While I am also not very optimistic this whole thing, it is completely different to ERP3.
---
There were many reasons a lot of hardcore/semi-hardcore guilds passed on ERP3. The main issue was training  for all raid wings with all CMs and no downstate would be a huge time commitment. ERP3 format guaranteed that a hardcore guild must stop doing its weekly runs since it split the guilds participating into two fractions: ERP team and other members.
---
Having a tournament with a format like it is written here would allow hardcore guilds to simply complete with each other doing mostly nothing but grinding 1 boss for 1 hour each week which most hardcore guilds like to do anyway.
---
No, I don't. Because absolutely no one would have 550 builds. Therefore, it's virtually unlimited. Unlike here where you get 2 and then gotta pay up.
---
If you want to be a cashcow, that's up to you. Not a reason to push people to be the same though.
---
My only issue is how dark abyss is in the world and how you can still make out armor in the preview window that's dyed abyss
---
He could've gotten more teams but he didnt want to have 2 "free wins" in the tournament
---
There are just a handfull of "group events" that realy need other ppl due to mechanics. 99,8% of all "group events" can be soloed. The bandit leaders are very easy on top of that.

We know. :)

(edit: this is btw the first post coming up if you search the subreddit for ‚taco‘)
---
Your inability to click more than one button at a time is not a valid argument for balance changes. Don't overthink it.
---
They only appear automatically when you're not tracking any other schievement for some reason.
---
This is another reason why I think the best solution is to allow arcDPS templates to co-exist.
---
Anet is constrained by the type of system they can actually ship in-game.  They have to make sure that incomplete builds and edge-case equipment issues are all covered, so casuals don't accidentally screw themselves.  Unfortunately this means anything they implement will be limited/less flexible.
---
Third-party add-ons can be less user-friendly, while being feature-rich.  If something breaks, third-party devs aren't accountable bc it was "use at your own risk".  This gives them freedom that Anet will never have.
---
I believe the two can co-exist, if Anet allows it.  They would still get plenty of revenue from their official/safer/convenient system, while hardcore players could use arcDPS on top of that for advanced features.
---
The community should focus on pressuring Anet to not ban arcDPS templates, instead of picking at a system that could never replace it.
---
You are kind of making my point though... for some people... the chairs means more than the templates. That YOU are saying those people don't matter to me is a bigger problem than me saying that both matter equally. For some people paying more for templates will not affect the game at all. For some people, it will. For some people those cosmetic things are the game. And you are discounting them just because they don't share the same experiences from the game as you. I am not discounting that templates matter to people. I'm saying that you are better served trying to make them better rather than just complaining about the cost. That's actually a message that serves you better in an effort to get your voice heard which is the exact opposite of me telling you to fuck off or pay money. However, I could understand if your only complaint about templates is that they aren't free, then I can see how you think that. But I would hope that you have more to bring to the table than that... this game costs more to develop than that.
---
Also I surely do care how many people are on Netflix... them getting more money  means I get more content which makes my experience with the service better.
---
That's some quality bug fixing .
---
[Maybe if your part of the clickers but the game just isn't designed around you.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dcska4/so_whats_the_point_of_sand_shades_in_pve_after/f2b4xlq/)
---
You actually had a reasonable point at the start, before you used hyperbole to completely miss the other guy's point and continued acting like a self-righteous twat. Society mostly doesn't give a shit what you say if you say it like an asshole, so this might be a life lesson for you to reflect on.
---
But probably not.
---
Ya, like, word. Sheesh. Nice art, but stuff like this is why Chrono's turbo-dead. :(
---
&gt; I think your point is
---
no, that is NOT my point.
---
My point is that this whole situation is repeating itself. ArenaNet does something, players get triggered by it, players complain about it, a few weeks later everyone buys the shit out of it, rinse and repeat.
---
&gt; Meanwhile, don't accuse others of "inaction" when voting with our wallet (as not buying whatever ANet is selling) is more valid than bitching about things on Reddit, (and often for the sake of entertainment).
---
Now, hold your horses and don't put words in my mouth only because you read what you wanted to read. I'm not accusing anyone here only that it seems that complaining on Reddit doesn't seem to help or will result in something the players want. Again, I have seen this multiple times before with the same outcome. My **suggestion** was to try something else.
---
And, again, voting with your wallet is nice and all but if you look at how many mount licenses we have now, how many players bought the mount skin licenses and everything else that players poured their money in while Reddit went batshit... or that other gaming communities are doing the exact same thing with no change... doesn't that tell you that "voting with your wallet" is nice and all but only helps yourself in feeling better in not supporting this practice. It doesn't change the situation because you and I as an individual are insignificant and more likely a rounding error in the equation.
---
So yeah, I encourage you and everyone to vote with your wallet but I bet it won't matter, like I said, I have seen this before.
---
they can be purchased with karma, which is earned easily and much faster than gold. shards are used to make legendary items, which were designed to be earned through gameplay. You can earn karma much more easily than gold, especially if you use items that increase your karma gain. The wiki is your friend, if you haven't heard about it: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Karma
---
&gt; Since your weapon is now stored in the arsenal inventory, you can't just open your bags to quickly throw on a weapon to your off/main hand for something and then swap back.
---
Are you sure? What would prevent them to use the current right-click menu to equip that weapon and replace it with the one you currently use?
---
Uh, huh. I'm not the one that's gonna have to deal with your immature ass for the rest of my life so good luck with that.
---
I just read the banner... "Beetle Champions League"...
---
Why am i dissapointed?
---
If you save a weapon to any template, it is in the arsenal. You cannot use the equipment template unless the item is in the arsenal.
---
I'm truly amazed at the skill some players have with this mount.  When I see my timestamps compared to the top ones, I shake my head in wonderment.
---
Kind of cool to have a mini game like this built from a mount. Makes me wonder if they couldn't also have Griffon races (through aerial rings) or Springer obstacle courses.  I'd suck equally at those, but I pride myself on my consistency.
---
It requires to much work for me to figure out why it is bad. Like I get that people think it is bad and stuff. I am not sure why. I think I don't even understand how it is going to work. I just heard I could copy paste build stuff from the internet and after that I kinda zone out. I mean I still need to figure out how to get that dragon mount.
---
Don't get me wrong I believe you guys. And I get it sucks. Things happen that suck for me sometimes to and it sucks. And I hope you guys get your issues fixed. And I don't really like how they are making QoL stuff like this cost money.
---
Imo split armory storage from gear loadout. Pay for storage, have all loadouts for free. If you want to spam your inventory with all the stuff (or maybe already spent gems on inventory slots) then you don't need to buy armory. If you value the seperate storage, buy armory slots that stores your gear from a loadout of your choice. 
---
TLDR don't force people to pay for storage if they only want to have gear loadouts.
---
Did some toxic asshole upset you at some point and now you want to take it out on everyone more hardcore than you or?

I understand the complaints, I really do. I think it is weird that there is one system but three different monetizations on them. I don't understand why they didn't use the same behaviour as they had in GW1 in which you store build templates in your documents folder instead of storing it on the servers since IIRC those storage templates are only for the builds itself and not the gear.
---
What I'm against to beat the horse until it is a mushy piece of unrecognizable generic ooze until suddenly nobody cares about the issue enough because they supported that practice since they bought the expanders for the slots and storage.
---
I mean, I can even understand THAT. It is easy to sit in front of your computer and go on a rant on Reddit without actually having to do something and think that something will change. But, speaking from experience, it won't.
---
And let not kid ourselves, those posts are not "expressing their concerns" but rather rant about why this thing is bad and how ArenaNet should just allow ArcTemplates to further exist. And all of that because they saw something that is still almost a month away.
---
I dont think it's false advertisment if the picture was just concept art, ive seen plenty of concept art, stylized images and cinematics from this game to be able to tell the difference versus ingame assets.
---
I tried to buy that for her but it wasn't in the store anymore. I do have a mesmer but it's faster to just sit at her computer and do some things for her than to switch characters
---
Spare them , some of them need 2 weeks to learn a new build .
---
not a single good guild will participate because the whole league is 0 of a challenge and the prices are dogshit
---
That is true!
---
Just request a refund and you'll get your gems back and keep the chair.
---
It's definitely an extreme example. I haven't encountered that particular tactic either. If it became prevalent enough it would probably make having a melee weapon a lot more desirable for all builds.
---
I was wondering too, were you not able to use chaos storm? Chaos aura comes to mind too. It wouldn't be much but it didn't sound like he was pressuring you very hard in your comment. Maybe it would be enough to get him to change tactic?
---
I think it's more they don't know what/how other things will be affected by any change they make to the core code.
---
Like a house of cards, the older code at the bottom has had many things built on top of it.  Changing something that deep would have a cascading effect.
---
This is simply not true. The game does not tell you anything at all about the total cost of the collection chain before it unlocks the saddle collection step.
---
For me personally, this has already been the second time the game tricked me into such a “sunk cost“ scenario, with the first time being the Requiem armor collection. Situations like these make me hate the game (and myself, since I allow the game to pressure myself into a boring grind.)
---
You know what. No. It's a very high quality game. How many hours have you played it?
---
I'm not suggesting Anets staff doesn't know how to do their jobs. But at some point I think it's a bit embarrassing to say "we can't change things because we don't know how."
---
But maybe that's common in professional game design, idk.
---
&gt;Forum Account Suspended  
---
&gt;You have been suspended from posting on the Guild Wars 2 Forums. You will be able to participate on the forums in 4 days.
---
Don't say anything about it boys.
---
I honestly don't think it's anything that drastic. They just don't make the appropriate changes in response to criticism because they think the criticism is unreasonable. You can't operate with that mentality. That said, I do agree that ArenaNet are not your friends, and people need to stop treating them as such. I'd be more than happy to treat them that way if they responded in kind, but they only treat you well if you're happy with exactly what they want to do.
---
Running DoA with my GW1 guild until 4am during highschool years. Good times.
---
No. And. Legendary Prefix Template. Legendary Armory. Please. ಠ\_ಠ
---
Storm might have been on cooldown, don't recall.  As I said, I was just shocked.   Earlier on I'd seen him use the shield to defend a teammate from ranged attacks, so this time I figured if I just got inside the bubble, I could DPS.
---
No he wasn't pressuring me much, just auto attacking with staff, but at one point I dropped to 70% health and just peeled off since I couldn't damage him, and his bubble was still there.
---
NA
---
I think money complicates things to the point where Anet might actually take action against players using third party solutions.
---
I really, *really* hope that at some point this month Anet addresses the arc-sized elephant in the room.
---
Go into options and disable post processing. Thank me later.
---
Cuz they kill me a lot in WvW. :D
---
This is crap and it's definitely going to fuck me up
---
I have been trying to figure out the targeting but I think I am just too slow switching targets while shooting (and the attack scene goes by too fast for me) so I can never get enough weak points shot down.
---
I always hated this. A lot of different armors pieces fit together by looks, but still have a different material look about them. So the same color looks different. Can spend all the time to match different shades of colors to make up for that material difference. In the dye window? Looks perfect. In the world? All fucked up.
---
&gt; You're not going to have a zerk weapon on a viper set tab, and suddenly want to use the zerker weapon in your zerk tab; simply put, **that's idiotic**!
---
I thought I was clear.
---
I suppose you could do  that. GW1 had 4 weapon sets that worked how you're describing, they just only worked with weapons and not armor. In my personal opinion I think what we have is actually better than that and worth monetizing, but I could see there being value in a free system that is just gear "sets" that you can set using stuff in your inventory. 
---
You don't get your inventory space back and these sets would basically just unequip what you're currently wearing for whatever is in the set you click on. So then the gear template system that includes storing said gear becomes just more convenience, same as the skill loadouts. Makes sense to me honestly.
---
I've tanked Xera multiple times (and almost every other boss as well) on a firebrand with full minstrel, never really had any problems. I can PM you some logs of those if you're interested. The key to do it on Xera is to bring some condition cleanse, such as Mantra of Lore and cleanse the confusion stacks frenzy causes. You can easily self-sustain and act as the 2nd healer for the group.
---
I have a few major complaints still that would not be addressed. I also want to make clear that while it sucks that you have to pay, that is not my primary concern. My primary concern is the current implemenation is worse for my situation in almost every metric. The only things that I prefer over Arc are the hotkey option and being able to share builds easily. Every other aspect is a direct downgrade imo over what we can do now with Arc. Also, based on their stream there is a technical limit to the max number of templates and we may never see more than 6 per character due to this. This could be changed as they get more info, but I have little faith this will change.
---
With the Anet implementation, if I am doing a raid and need to make one small change to my build that change will overwrite my current template. This is incredibly annoying as every time I want to make a small adjustment, I will need to remember to go back and change it back manually every time. 
---
Another issue is that as it is now (or at least what was described on the stream) if you move gear from one character to another, you cannot have templates on both characters. For example, I have leg armor that I move between my guard and rev. As it is now with Arc, I can move them from one char to another and then load up the Arc templates and it will put everything into place perfectly. With the new system it will not let me save the gear in two places so I will have to manually do it every time I move gear between characters. For most stuff this isn't a big deal, but it is a major blow to sharing legendary gear, especially armor.
---
These are two major blows to how I play currently that would be very annoying day-to-day excluding the total number of templates. I could also go into detail on how problematic the total number of templates are.
---
Generally speaking in a CPU limited situation (like GW2 most of the time) RAM speed/timings/latency does matter for FPS. I doubt it will make a appreciable difference though.
---
Classic has open world pvp you fucking idiot
---
Change of stats for me is the same: I click arc templates the same way for exotic / ascended / legendary
---
Slots are the same coz of sigils
---
You can buy the Asuran Colorizer Desensitizer from the BLTC for 600 Gems, which normalizes colors on maps and removes all the color effects.
---
Something everyone likes to forget, Arc didn't even always swap properly and then on top it sometimes just flat out deleted gear and they even warned that it could with no warning confirmation.
---
So hmm pay for slots above 3, don't waste inventory or possibly have legendaries deleted forever.
---
Do the raid sell and the runs, while participating in the competition?
---
I’ve stopped using this method for a long time now. Due to how often I have to switch between Chrono and Mirage (and utilizing legendary gear), I always go through the hero panel, clicking on individual squares to swap items. (I also started doing this before “equip in slot 2” became a thing. It’s just as fast when you get used to it.  
---
Edit: the hero panel also remembers the last panel you were in, so if you don’t fiddle with dyes or mounts every 12 seconds (like I do...) it should open up to equipment.
---
You can tank with firebrand; just during the blurred frenzy you'll need to either dodge away/step back a little so you're out of range, put resistance on yourself via Courage4; or like... mace+focus (I'm assuming the tank was a healbrand.)
---
I think the biggest contributor is a management staff that is filled less than stellar people combined with a grunt force that just isn't paid enough to care  
---
(if glassdoor is to be believed)
---
Then why's it got so many pure dps traits?
---
I completely agree with you.
---
I dont really mind if they monetize build and gear loadouts, thats understandable, but having to pay for storage feels just bad. it should be free and unlimited somehow.
---
Can't they just put out an apology and say that they will fix the model with an upcoming patch? Surely it cant be that hard to make a chair bigger, right?
---
Remember: https://i.imgur.com/p9QCNoe.png
---
tbh
---
A look at the upcoming Etherbound Pauldrons that were datamined, along with the other armor pieces we have so far. I actually kinda like this set.
---
I suppose if this is one of your biggest concerns then it’s not my place to crap on it. I hope that if this is a big enough concern for others as well that they have a way or develop a way to address it.
---
They are not going to fix the chair so this is their way of trying to make it go away, well that and giving out refunds to people asking for it.
---
It's not just the chair size, it's also the posture that was wrong.
---
It's updating fine from what I can tell. Maybe you're running into caching of some kind? Unless they saw the complaints about a time freeze and reversed it?
---
Entering crystal oasis the first time
---
Yikes.

---
&gt; bent to player feedback
---
mount select licenses were the result of the last overblown community outrage
---
I guess I’ve just never done things like that so it’s not my place to say. I definitely have my concerns, but it’s mostly with the template limits and costs than things such as this. For my personal play style, I think it actually looks really nice and will free up a lot of inventory space. However that doesn’t downplay others concerns.
---
U can't buy the other parts anymore right? :s just came back from a break of the game :s
---
Suying would work despite being a case that would be silly AF. And you can't preview how your character looks on the chair in gemstore. The preview shows just the empty chair.
---
Haha yes, that will help the game, send it to a bunch of clickbait youtubers who thrive on outrage culture and can blow this entirely out of proportion.
---
The sitting pose (at the very least for charr) is also wrong, so they just decided to swap the banner and advertise the chair how it is, rather than resize and re-pose it.
---
Many tend to share their own stories online for free anyway (they can even copy and paste an existing story they've posted). It's very unlikely this publication will make a profit. We are thinking of it as a printed group exhibition.
---
"overblown"
---
this change proves that it is though? LMAO
---
The cause of failure was not the firebrand, it was the player. Propably every class can tank Xera by either blocking the flurry or dodging away from her and the group. If you have to dodge position her in a way that a backwards dodge does not mean you fall off the edge. I did it many times on minstrel heal scourge when both chronos were not ready to do it. Firebrand can use the heal skill that blocks, but you lose quickness uptime.
---
You mean a lower percentage of people who disagree with you. I won't fault you for constructing your own echo chamber but I can still fault you for pretending that's not what it is.
---
**GW2 TacO ReActif with version 042.2533r of the overlay has just been released**
---
The contents of the packs have also been updated / corrected for what should be
---
More details on the site directly : https://www.heinze.fr/taco/?lang=en
---
Yeah people are acting like the picture is the real version. That picture would have been made *after* the model. The model may be small but it's not the thing that has to be fixed, regardless of whether or not you think it's too small. The picture was the incorrect thing since it came second.
---
I don't remember them saying "We are changing scourge skills because some people click their skills and it's too difficult for them."
---
I do however, remember them saying it was a WvW specific balance change.
---
As far as balancing changes go, they should factor in the top 1% but certainly not the minority of people who click their skills.
---
The pain is too real.
---
All things come to an end, sooner or later.
---
Seems like they unfroze it: https://imgur.com/a/J1WfyvN
---
sorry I meant "pReDaToRy" and "aNtI-CoNsuMeR".
---
There, I said the buzzwords, can I get upvotes from the hive mind now
---
Well, maybe we should care ourselves about being treated fairly by companies instead of this blatant manouvers. Call those youtubers however you want but that doesn't change the facts.
---
My intel pentium g4600 clogs fine with 8gb 2,4k at 1080p. 560rx if interested. It is pretty damn budget.
---
I know this isn't meant to be funny, so don't ask me why, but this made me chuckle
---
Yeah i heard a lot of good things about it, will definitely try it out once i get the new setup and compare, unfortunately i can't think of many consistent/reliable scenarios to recreate a FPS benchmark on GW2, could go to highly populated areas but if theres a few more/less people around it'll definitely make a difference and produce not so reliable results :(
---
Hoping i can get a good stable chip that can OC well, might make tests with current and new setup to see how big is the difference as well, saw a 3700x video handling GW2 pretty damn good but he plays at 4K instead, maxed settings with nameplates on and still keeping ~30+ FPS in combat during a World Boss seems pretty impressive for GW2 if you're not running OC'd Intel CPU's, i imagine WvW can get more CPU-intensive depending on how many people are around.
---
You didn’t even link it here
---
If you are unhappy with the chair and were misled by the original banner, put in a ticket for a refund. They have been refunding gems while letting you retain the chair. Fiasco/crisis averted. 
---
Also, it is unlikely they froze time stamps and were scared into unfreezing them, and is more likely it was just an issue with your cache or even a miscellaneous server error.
---
Sometimes it seems like they completely ignore the pve impact of a change when introducing pvp stuff. Scourge and scrapper used to be horribly op in pvp, but struggled in pve compared to other specs. Now pve scrapper almost doesn't exist, and they are doing the same thing to scourge.
---
Pretty budget yeah but i doubt that setup will sustain good frames on big zerg events with models on high/highest and shadows on ultra since even with a 4790k i can't :(
---
More curious about the RAM frequency/timings impact on performance
---
It's almost as if a force dedicated to censoring topics that they perceive as potentially hurtful to the companies bottom line is a boorish and ineffective strategy. woooow
---
Yes, but I doubt that is possible with how their fundation for this was build, now I don't know much about that but judging by their other projects I doubt they could make it.
---
Absofuckinglutely. Anything other than sparkles and sunshine about how great things are is immediately shut down using whatever rule they can think to apply.
---
Pisses me off just thinking about it. 
---
That's probably why so many people respond to their bullshit on the subreddit.
---
Eh usually I would agree but in this case this was definitely false advertising.
---
Gaile? She was a sweetheart who was there from the early days of gw1. She liked to keep things positive but I'm sure she wouldn't have pulled any type of shit like this.
---
Sure, a server error which prevented that particular thread from bumping (for everyone, mind) while others worked fine. 
---
I mean, come on.
---
This isn't an issue of resources. This is an issue of logic. I've been thinking about this problem for years personally, because it's a logical conundrum, not just a programming one, and I haven't been able to come up with a better solution. I've been saying for literally years that the equipment storage issue is the reason we didn't get build templates much earlier. How do you make it so a system can swap between all of the different permutations of gear that a character has access to at a single time point, when you cannot guarantee that that character will still have those gear items in the future when you go to switch? 
---
The answer is, simply, you can't. You can't do it, not safely, not without encountering failure states. So you need to lock those items in a separate area. This isn't a "oh whoopsie daisie, we forgot to make this work when we built the sytem" thing. If they had known how the system was going to work 7 years ago (they didn't, but let's just assume they did) they still would not have been able to come up with a better solution here, other than to simply make the gear swap fail if the game can't find the item in question (as, apparently, WoW does). 
---
ANet doesn't work like that, they don't make their games so that something can fail to work as expected. That's not their design philosophy. They prevent the user from doing that thing in the first place. 
---
As far as you hypothetical client is concerned: 1) your clients are not children, ANet has different priorities and one of them is user friendliness above everything, error messages are a normal piece of life in office software, 2) you likely do not have thousands of clients, so a relatively small increase in storage space for one account will not be multiplied across thousands or tens of thousands of accounts, and 3) you likely do not **already** charge your client based on how much data they store on your servers, while ANet effectively already does that via bank and bag slots, and so they're not going to undercut their preexisting business model.

[BLOG] [The Guild Wars 2 Team posted on October 03, 2019](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/a-message-from-mike-obrien/):
---
&gt;    In the summer of 2000, Pat, Jeff, Brett, Brandon, Gaile, Josh and I worked out of the living room of my apartment. We dreamed of mixing role-playing and strategy, of delivering a constant stream of new content into an online world, and of doing it with a friendlier business model than we’d seen before. That first summer we didn’t have much but we had a great team, and built the beginnings of what became *Guild Wars* and ArenaNet.
---
&gt;We couldn’t have known then the extent of the journey we were embarking on or all the wonderful and talented people who would join us along the way. For the past two decades we’ve gotten to work with brilliant developers and advisors, we’ve enjoyed an amazing relationship with the *Guild Wars* community, and were able to pursue the games of our dreams.
---
&gt;I’ve appreciated every moment of it. But the time has come for me to take a step back. Next week I’ll join some of my friends in forming a new studio. We’ll go back to the beginning and make small games again.
---
&gt;I’ll always love ArenaNet and *Guild Wars*. Now I’ll get to experience Living World releases as a player rather than as a developer.
---
&gt;Two years ago, when I transitioned away from the *Guild Wars 2* game director role to focus on new product development, I asked Mike Zadorojny to take on that role. Now as he takes on a larger leadership role, I am confident that ArenaNet and *Guild Wars 2* are in good hands. Z is a true champion of the *Guild Wars* franchise and of this studio’s values; he is the best person to continue carrying the torch at the company.
---
&gt;I want to thank the *Guild Wars* community for supporting us all these years. Some of my happiest times have been hanging out with you at launch days, anniversary parties, championship matches, trade shows and other gatherings. It’s great to see so many of the same faces year after year. My goal in making games is always to entertain people, so nothing makes me happier than to think we made a game that could entertain people for years.
---
&gt;A moment I’ll always remember is standing in front of you at PAX 2015 to announce that we’d make the base game free-to-play. It was the right thing to do for the game, but how would existing players react? You’re giving away what I paid for? Will the game be overrun by noobs? But that wasn’t your reaction at all. You formed welcoming committees to meet players as they came out of the tutorial zones and take them under your wings. It’s a lasting memory of how supportive you’ve always been toward this studio.
---
&gt;I want to thank TJ Kim and NCSOFT for standing behind ArenaNet and giving us the space to try new things. We first met NCSOFT in 2002, at a time when many companies didn’t “get” online-only games, but NCSOFT was so in tune with what we were trying to accomplish that we couldn’t even finish our pitch before they started making the pitch for us. TJ always loved *Guild Wars*, and played the game as much as many of you. When we talked, we’d talk games. I’ve worked for companies that were all about quarterly earnings, and I’ve always appreciated that NCSOFT is about making the best games.
---
&gt;And I want to thank the team at ArenaNet. It’s been an honor to work beside you all these years. You’re a team of artisans, sweating the details, putting your personal touches on everything this studio ships, even through seven retail releases and 80 episodes. You make games because you love the games. And you’re crazy, too, in all the right ways, daring yourselves to do things like “E3 For Everyone” for *Guild Wars 1* or launching new content every two weeks through the first year of *Guild Wars 2*. We’ve had amazing adventures together. It’s been the journey of a lifetime, and I’ll always carry your passion with me.

&gt;#### A Message From Mike Zadorojny, Game Director of *Guild Wars 2*
---
&gt;To the *Guild Wars* community,
---
&gt;I’ve been working at ArenaNet since January 2006. I started in this company as a contract QA tester, and I’ve had the amazing opportunity to work with Mike O’Brien on developing both of the worlds of Tyria since the *Factions* product release for the original *Guild Wars*. We’ve always strived to make positive player interaction one of the core tenets of our games, and it has been a true joy to see the *Guild Wars* community come together in the virtual worlds we’ve helped to create. Knowing so many people found joy in what we do has been an incredibly rewarding and enjoyable experience. Mike led the studio for so many years, and so much of the amazing culture in this building stems from his leadership along with the other founders during the early days of ArenaNet, which strived to be a creative space where art came to life and the studio innovated and created games that were detailed, wondrous spaces for everyone to enjoy.
---
&gt;I took over the role of Game Director on *Guild Wars 2* right after we launched *Path of Fire*. Assuming that role made me appreciate how passionate and amazing this community is, reminding me each day how important our work is. Since then we’ve aimed at making huge strides to the quality and cadence of content we’ve been adding to the game every year. I love the fans, I love this team and we’re all very excited for you to play the upcoming chapters of The Icebrood Saga. We’ve got some really fun content on the way.
---
&gt;I want to personally wish Mike the very best in whatever is next for him. Though he is leaving the studio, his presence and legacy will always be a part of the team, and I am going to make sure I do everything I can to keep the torch he passed me burning brightly into the future, both for the *Guild Wars* franchise and ArenaNet itself. I am looking forward to continuing this journey with all of you.

Forgot [Mawdrey](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mawdrey)! It doesn't look that epic, but it has a bit of a story to it, and you get 3 different skins of the growth stages of the plant.
---
The [Wayfarer's Henge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Wayfarer%27s_Henge) is similarly a collection + skins of stages + short story.
---
I did a few times in the past.
---
You got 6 template slots for free per characters too if you get the free ones in the gemstore when it launches, or 3 if you dont, and what is free is 50% of the total max per character. Remember  that the gear templates store gear so they dont take slots in your inventory, and the templates is account-wide. Also remember that GW2 is not an subscription game so someways apart from ppl who buy the game most earn money from things like skins/ acocunt upgrades/character upgrades/convience items etc. 
---
B2P=
---
Being able to play the game without spending money-
---
Is completely the opposite compare to F2P, a player will have to pay the whole game at some point, and it might be a paywall that turns off players with a low budget.
---
The sustainability of the game will rely only on the players spending in a possible Cash Shop, unless a paid DLC or expansion system is put in place to generate revenue.
---
F2P=Being able to play the game without spending money-
---
It is very difficult to apply it flawlessly, and it’s not always a fitting model for a game for many reasons.
---
Player actions-The biggest weakness of the F2P model: Most of the troublemakers are players who do not spend money in the game.
---
Here I described it : https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3h3p6a/gw2organizercom_updated/ . I think there was another post a few months later but can't find it.
---
That's not good.
---
Massive thanks to Mike for everything he's done over the years. I don't even know where to begin with how big of an impact Guild Wars has had on my life (personal relationships, experiences, etc.).  
---
As it relates to the current state of things, yikes.
---
oh no
---
What the what?
---
Thanks for explaining illogical to me mate, really doesn't make you sound like a condescending turd.
---
If you read the initial post where I mentioned microtransactions, you would have noticed that  it was preceded by the word "mobile", without a comma... 
---
Using that information you would have been able to infer that I am comparing GW2 microtransactions to mobile gaming microtransactions, hence why I said 
---
&gt; almost all are convenience or cosmetics related. 
---
And unlike in many mobile games I dont have to pay to unlock skills or cooldown reduction timers or entire classes or units or whatever.
---
But yo, if you think the gw2 gemstore is not for you, that's okay. It's all optional unlocks. Nothing is mandatory...
---
Playing more uses server resources that cost money. Playing isn't "sponsoring".
---
Well i laughed, i must love shit jokes then.
---
Thats fine, better to laugh than be grumpy all the times :)
---
Hold off on the tin foil for now. Wait and see if there are other **voluntary** departures from long time employees first.
---
I wonder if this thread is going to be on heavy moderation... if not, it will be a fun ride.
---
&gt; well they cant monetize performance, or can they? 1 fps for 1k gems, u can buy 100 max
---
Not directly, but I'd be spending gems on bank tabs and who knows what else if I could actually *play* the game comfortably.
---
That man is tirelessly pursuing new challenges. thats just him being him, I'll keep an eye on whatever he will cook this time ;)
---
Especially for a purchased skin.
---
&gt; They've needed to be purged and replaced for years.
---
As if they were acting this way on their own and not because Anet hired them to be like this. It's not like they could get away with being oppressive assholes for years without the management's support.
---
probably... but the timing still feels too well timed
---
For me it is the countless nights I spent with my other 3 friends farming CoF path 1 to craft our legendaries. After 8 months I was able to craft my Sunrise. Those nights were epic.
---
Sorry, I meant through an official forum post/news post/guild chat.  My point was, right now it is in their best interest to ignore it.
---
But if we can focus our feedback on the continued allowance of arcTemplates, then Anet could be shifted into a position where working with third-parties to allow add-ons that compliment in-game templates would be a valid choice.
---
Hopefully a new MMO.
---
It doesn't sound like that at all to me. It sounds like he *just* decided to leave. 
---
If NCSoft was taking over, I feel we'd have also gotten a statement from whoever from their side of things is taking over as well to feed us some PR nonsense about how they have the best interests of the game and community in mind. Also, they could have just removed him back when they enacted the layoffs.
---
I'm sure this could still happen down the line, but to assume that's the case immediately is honestly unrealistic I feel.
---
Once again... a decision like this isn't taken the night before, but releasing this is just another PR nightmare to add to their list.
---
3 disasters in 1 month ish, it's insane.
---
&gt; Why does this smack of fallout for the Build template drama
---
Correlation, not causation. They've been through other drama that's just as bad if not worse.
---
I love seeing posts like this. I’ve been playing since about HoT launch and my wife just started playing a few months ago. I also got her into Monster Hunter and Warframe and she loves them all. GW2 is definitely one of her favorites because of the character customization, achievements and collections (she loves collecting shiny things), collecting Pets as a ranger, etc. It’s really awesome being able to share that stuff together. The other night we had a blast playing through all of the explorable paths of Cadeceucs Manor with a PuG. We were all laughing and joking and added each other at the end. One guy said he was new and this was his first time playing through it at all and he hadn’t actually done the story yet so we all blasted through it with him. The community experience is so amazing in this game.
---
yeah Gw2 is going to go through a change. for the better or worse will have to be seen
---
MO was the CEO of the company, he didn't work on games in that position.
---
had the pleasure of meeting him in NYC before GW2 came out to play it briefly and talk to some of the anet staff there.  Wish the best for him and his future endeavors. Looking to see what he is a part of next, GW1 is my favorite computer game of all time.
---
I don't mind certain aspects being stronger in one area of the other. I don't like it when it gimps an entire one for the sake of another.
---
They really need to start doing proper splits.
---
Necros were literally the only class able to affect themselves and targets away from them in the same skill. Any other class either aims at a ranged area *or* themselves, not both.
---
Now, you have to choose between affecting you or a ranged target, or pick the smaller shades to cover both. This adds depth to positioning, timing and avoiding enemy pressure, thus skill.
---
This won't end well, Commander.
---
all the best for your future, mike! thanks for a awesome franchise you and everyone at anet build over the years!
---
Well that's one way to get out from under a game engine you had a hand in making nearly 15 years ago.
---
I love the fact that not only are they treating it as a "bug fix", but they actively tried to stop the thread by freezing it so new posts wouldn't move it to the top like it's supposed to and only stopped once people noticed.  
---
All right before the news that Mike O'Brien is leaving the sinking ship. You sure love having bad PR ArenaNet.
---
he did after collin left and thats what he missed.
---
 Not surprised at all with the way things are going
---
Mike if you read this, please remake guild wars 1, it was loved by so many. If you no longer can use guild wars trademark, then just make something like guild wars 1, where tactics/theorycrafting of builds actually matters and the game is hard and sandboxy! And you can use unreal engine to make the engine actually perform well.
---
I really hope the game doesn't suffer with Mike Zadorojny's new responsibilities. It seems like he's doing a really great job as Game Director. Especially because he actually plays the game more than most people. As MO says, he's the best person for the job. But if MO could handle being President and Game Director at the same time, so could Mike Z.!
---
&gt;I’ll always remember standing in front of you to announce that we’d make the base game free-to-play. It was the right thing to do for the game.
---
This is true, but it would be nice if more people knew about it. Though the free-to-play experience still receives free content updates, I think it should be a little less restrictive (but keep the chat restrictions) so that more people know *Guild Wars 2* as a great free-to-play game to recommend to people, hopefully boosting sales and player counts. Right now, many people I talk to (1) don't know it's free, (2) consider the free game more of like a bad trial or demo, (3) don't know *Guild Wars* is even a thing.
---
Reaper is fun and yet simple. It's not a bad pick. It's my main through and through. Except I never used it for group play. Maybe I should now. 
---
I always enjoyed healing scourge and it was fun, though a bit boring after extended play time.... but I'm really considering swapping my fractal main now. Maybe time to go Firebrand.
---
I honestly think we get Cantha as the games final expansion. Maybe I'm being too optimistic? I would also go for a scaled down GW3 that's more of a true sequel to GW1.
---
I see this more as an extension of the previous layoffs.  Head of a studio has a lot of balls in the air and it takes time to hand those things off.  Plus, if you added him to that list of layoffs it would have looked even worse.  Since he was mostly working on other projects instead of GW2, I see that direct correlation back to the layoffs.
---
It now have no Expansion Mike instead! (sarcasm)
---
I'm not grumpy. He asked why he was getting downvoted and I explained why.
---
&gt;Wait and see if there are other voluntary departures from long time employees first.
---
Or i can talk about the fact THE PRESIDENT OF ARENANET JUST LEFT THE COMPANY.
---
The last founder of ANet just left and you feel like waiting for someone else to leave?
---
meanwhile on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Delafina777/status/1179843065193713664) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Well, we do still have 3 charges no matter what. So you can always just place one on you. This change doesn't harm 3 shades as much but it harms those that used Sand Savant like healing scourge, which  is, or was, my main build to run in groups.
---
Thanks!
---
(explosion sound)
---
He won't be able to, unless his new studio is also owned by NCSoft or ArenaNet.
---
jeeeesus fucking christ..

---
Goodbye, MO.
---
Next step is to implement some people who have no trouble milking the game even harder until the end.
---
Yeah, when Colin left, people were claiming doomsday, but the game actually saw a boon after.
---
Bad timing for such a message or in other words: Business as usual.
---
Can't wait to read the fanfictions of the doomsayers once more.
---
&gt; It's a small issue and they addressed it.
---
Chair hasn't been fixed yet and Anet won't admit fault. That's not addressing anything.
---
&gt; this is another nail in the coffin
---
Which Anet could have avoided. 
---
Like many other outrages, it all stemmed from weird decisions made by Anet. Don't dismiss this as something the community blows out of proportion and then blame that community for making the game look bad. If Anet makes bad decisions we should let them know. 
---
It's not our job to make the game look better to outsiders anyway.
---
Splitting up shades that way has allowed me to save the lives of many pug members many times. A quick F1 and F3 really makes the difference. I guess I'm going to have to get used to taking 3 shades rather than one powerful one. But that gimps healing scourge since Sand Savant added boon duration.
---
Even MO was so disappointed in the Charr chair situation that he left :(.
---
He took the game director position from Colin after he left and held it for years. Plenty of employee reports suggest he was always a bit of a micromanager. He says in this message himself that he was working on the other projects. It's pretty clear that he doesn't want to be running a massive studios, he wants to be making games. Which is something he seems to be pretty damn good at, so I'm happy for him, and don't think this is anywhere near as doom and gloom as people are making it out to be.
---
Yeah. Good thing I solo play as Reaper but this really makes me question continuing as a fractal healer.
---
lol. Your comment is just peak reddit insanity. Jesus.
---
It's because mesmers are designed to either stop you from doing something, punish you for doing something, or punish you for *not* doing something. Each of which is not a fun situation to be fighting against, because the mesmer feels like he's in control of the situation and you are not.
---
Think about confusion as a concept for a moment and ignore the fact that condition removal and resistance exist. Confusion hurts you for not doing something (letting the damage tick), and then hurts you more if you *do* do something. No matter what you do, that condition is going to punish you for just existing. Your options are either lose, or lose harder. Other conditions suck, but outside of the hard CCs, you have the option to continue to try and fight through them. Confusion punishes you for taking that option and that feels really bad.
---
Ikr, this community is now just fuming over build templates, chairs, etc and lashing out at every little thing... when you think about it being just some features in a game, and then at real world problems, it is rather pathetic giving this so much attention...
---
No expansion mike PepeHands
---
She banned more wvw people on a daily than the_Donald does on a week
---
I wish you the best Mike. You've done a great job and I absolutely love Arenanet, the product of your vision. I'll look forward your next projects and hopefully Anet can do without you.
---
Gee, NCsoft must have been more mad about the chair than we thought huh?
---
/s
---
F
---
at this point it's already founded. it will probably be revealed by a twitter message or something
---
I mean this with no amount of sarcasm: Good for him. 
---
He should absolutely get off this burning ship while he can still keep his pride.
---
I feel like they need to fix a lot of chair, and mount sizes for the charr. Most of them look absolutely puny
---
I hope that he tells us what his new company will be called so we can keep a look out for the games they make.
---
You're aware the layoffs were entirely Anet's fault right?
---
NCsoft is garbage yes but Anet has never been innocent either.
---
If you read the article, you'd see Mike hasn't been in charge of gw2 for the past couple years. Therefore, there is no difference to the game's trackplan.
---
You can reload the build from your account storage fairly quickly which doesn't seem to update when you change things on the fly. This doesn't solve the hotkey issue though. Do you feel that breaks the feature for you?
---
I'm amazed people still follow that nutjob ...
---
Then again... Mike did hire her...
---
mana.works

You're comparing 15-20 year old games to a 7 year old game, obviously the older ones are WAY less demanding. Just as an example, Halo 1 came out in 2001. A super high end PC back then had a 1ghz processor with 256-512MB of 100mhz RAM. Forget comparing it to even a modern smartphone, that's marginally more powerful than the very first iPhone from 2007. The one that didn't even have an app store. The technological leaps made between 2001 and 2012 that enabled a game like GW2 to even be made and playable on mass produced hardware are absolutely astounding.
---
The second point I want to make is that your specs were already pretty low end **(for gaming)** several years ago when they were brand new, and that is even more true today. It's a 5 year old laptop designed for productivity. Obviously you are going to have issues running a highly demanding, poorly optimized MMORPG that even modern gaming rigs get poor performance on.
---
And finally, expecting any sort of significant engine work on a 7 year old game from a dying game studio is simply foolish.
---
Cool project, thank you!
---
NCSoft had given near complete control of the game to ArenaNet and it didn't seem to work out since they took a lot of it back after the layoffs. It wouldn't surprise me if they did start to take over, but Mike O'Brien leaving seems like something he had planned for quite a while. 
---
Let's be 100% honest, this game is nowhere near the vision of the game we were once told anymore, it took a completely different turn and i honestly feel O'Brien disagreed with it deep down.
---
https://i.imgur.com/es4pJY6.png
---
Well no, because the 45 minutes to an hour that you spend participating in the competition (which doesn't include setup) could be spent selling more raids or working on a grind. From both a monetary and quality perspective, the incentive to do this isn't really there.
---
My biggest issue with this is that the proposed time frames are too short. To the best of my knowledge, very few fast kills and the strats that led to them were conceived of and executed in 45 minutes to an hour. You could say that teams can just plan out strategies in advance so that they're prepared for whatever boss they roll, but at that point you may as well just grind for a record on your own time. You could also say that teams can just use existing strategies but that will get old by the third week. In short, I don't think the current format inspires or encourages innovation beyond what players can do on their own time and terms.
---
It's a neat idea overall, but I would reconsider how you're going to motivate players to play and how to keep people interested week after week.
---
I think your take on this is pretty bad.
---
Probably.
---
Maybe the small studio is the canceled projects?
---
&gt; so blatantly against sexism
---
I'm not sure what gave you this idea, she's very blatantly sexist
---
Yep. That is some premium bullshit. That can "easily" fixed with a "save template" button. However its probably not easy at all to implement i guess. They would've done that if they could've do that, right?
---
Either the best roleplayer who ever existed or a psychopath.
---
gw2 had it's high point at hot launch when colin was around.
---
A drooling moron says something moronic. Next up, is water wet? Find out after the weather, over to you Tommy.
---
The opportunity cost of developing the build templates may warrant something, but it doesn't have to be a price tag. I believe their compensation is player retention at this point.
---
By not releasing an expansion after S4 and keeping the future of the game up in the air for so long, they disappointed and drove a considerable number of players away if reddit is to be believed. Even though one may argue that reddit is just a vocal minority, it is still the main outlet the players discuss the game in social media and there have been controversy after controversy in here for months, and rightfully so. I can't see how the game's image in reddit helps them.
---
And now, after saying that the saga will bring 'expansion level features', they will monetize not just the armory which stores equipments (their rationale for charging) but build templates too. Not only that, but they place an upper limit of how many templates people can even buy so they can expand it later in patches to jack up gem prices and get more people to buy gems, and they intentionally plan to release 2 equipment templates with 3 build templates so people will want to buy atleast one equipment template just to even it out. I am really hoping that the price isn't going to be something like 400 gems per character for single build template expansion, but I am not holding my breath. If templates are indeed announced with a ridiculous price tag, then I am not sure what to do anymore.
---
Like they had this big opportunity to make players happy again after the saga announcement event debacle, and they manage to faceplant again. I was expecting they would monetize somethint about build templates if they ever made it, but I wouldn't imagine it would be this limited.
---
Epic legend, Slayer of Issormir.
---
you're ridiculous lol
---
People forgot that Colin was the main culprit for HoT being the mess it was from the announcement, through the content drought to the mindless grind that was until the Content Patch that changed everything. Hell he was adamant that 400 Hero Points for the Elite Specs was the way to go and if it wasnt for the backlash it would carry to PoF.
---
mobile games obv
---
I wonder what she thinks about her father. Does she have a son?
---
One of the projects was a mobile game of the GW IP. So not entirely, at least. Probably not at all, given that the IP would no doubt be owned by NCSoft.
---
This is Reddit, the entire website is an echo chamber.
---
&gt;  (apparently he was crying around the studios)
---
I'm sorry, what?
---
There was that time that ANet removed the custom gold/gem currency exchange, and reddit/the forums threw such a fit that they put it back in.
---
Their response went from something along the lines of "We removed this feature because we thought the UI was too confusing for new players," (this was around the time of the new-player focused feature pack in 2014, I think) to eventually, "Okay! Okay! We put it back in the game."

Wishing him the best! Good luck with your next project!
---
Seems like Icebrood Saga is the last chapter of GW2 story.
---
Psychopath. *Definitely* a psychopath.
---
Not even just the layoffs, Mike was forced to step up during a time people were losing faith in the game with Colin leaving as well as other long time faces, with loads of dramatic backlashes (JP, F2P), and also the huge pressures that come with xpac releases.
---
It's insane he's been holding down the arenanet ship for 20 years. Even if he wasn't under all this insane pressure and stress, even if you really loved the studio and believed in it and loved who you worked with... sometimes you just really need a good change after that long. Which is why it's surprising that he's stayed this long, but at the same time this announcement was completely expected and understood.
---
By how it's worded, it's formed by some of the original dev team as well. Which in a workplace environment all the these years feels like your family.
---
Given their express statement was that arc templates were permissible *until* an official solution was offered... and now that solution is being monetized... Yeah, I donno man. Seems like a huge leap from radio silence to okaying it again.
---
Technically it's not new responsibilities since Zadorojny's been doing it for a while \[O'Brien moved to those side projects that were stopped after the layoffs\].
---
yep.. those people are often the most sexist.. and i say that as someone from the left side ~.~
---
He also created the file format that many of their games used to use. It's even named after him.
---
&gt;MPQ is an archiving file format used by Blizzard Entertainment games. MPQ stands for Mike O'Brien Pack, which is named after its creator.
---
I'm looking forward to the game he will develop.
---
Plus the chair controversy.
---
Swapping from inventory is not a problem. The problem is that the weapons are bound on the templates so I cant switch them from my inventory. It is exactly what I want to do, to switch my weapons from inventory.
---
&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if NCSoft have said focus on GW2 only as thats our main income from Arenanet.
---
Wasn't this confirmed shortly after the layoffs and that the projects got canceled? I do recall it being discussed that NCSoft CEOs and shareholders canceled projects in development because they "have no immediate profit" or something similar and are just a drain until released and they wanted to increase profits across the board for the current quarter(s).
---
[mana.works](https://mana.works) is their web address. Not much content on the site, but it does list all the founders.
---
Exactly - that's why I bring this ridiculous thing with Scrapper. Sorry for trying to point out they do not think anymore just smack changes in hope these will stick.
---
After this release, I'll probably be looking into making a simple to use clipboard manager designed for this if nobody else gets to it before me.
---
anything to do with storing anything in this game is a convenience feature that is usually sold on the Black lion trading post. Not sure why it should be different now.
---
It's not funny or even entertaining in any way at that extent. It's mental illness.
---
There is actually categorydata.xml in the update so carefull not to replace that:-P
---
Welp it's official GW2 now has players that have a longer tenure than the developers.
---
necro has low dps compared to other classes. it's at the bottom of the list. if you compare classes, you classify necro as low, weaver as high, etc
---
i hope that explains it to you
---
We play a fantasy mmo, afterall.
---
..No.
---
Usable Build templates right now: 3
---
Usable Gear Templates right now: 1 [excluding PvP]
---
You get 1 new gear loadout.
---
(+ 3 Accountwide Build template slots that will be used up fairly quickly.)
---
Was with you last time, had a blast. Will join again this time as well!
---
Yep U CPU = completely crippled mobile low power CPU. The eqvivalent desktop CPU is at least 50%+ faster and in regards to this specific CPU, that was many generations ago. 
---
With my setup I get 75-110 fps at the Corsairs in Domain of Istan (1440p mostly high settings because I've reduced shadows/models for WvW). So sure not a speed demon but at least it's playable.
---
Just an oopsie guys. Nothing to see here. Nevermind the blatant plagiarism last month. Totally out of their hands.

Hi good questions! This is straight from the criteria I post for the judges before they begin voting. Also to clarify: **There is no theme here! We just happen to be doing it for Halloween because we're all huge fans! You can use any theme you like, even one you already have. Just be yourself!**  
---
**Judges should vote keeping the following things in mind:**
---
1. Variety of costume piece types
---
2. Whether the costume pieces work well together/match
---
3. The use of color
---
4. Whether you execute your own theme nicely
---
5. Whether they find your outfit to be creative/unique
---
6. Overall impression and quality of the entry
---
7. Excessive use of infusions, clipping
---
8. Judges may not use bias based on preference of color, gender, race or social influences
---
I agree that it's probably best for you to stop thinking ;)
---
She proclaims to be anti-sexism, while being sexist against men, while seemingly believing that "being sexist against men" is something that doesn't exist despite personifying it, is what he was talking about.
---
He can, if he simply doesn't use the Guild Wars IP.
---
Look at KH3's Verum Rex "trailer", it's very heavily based on Nomura's original Versus XIII ideas \[and the full CGI trailer along with the secret ending heavily imply it might be a real game being developed, meaning he might actually make a game using his original ideas\].
---
Well, next update is almost done, I've made a lot of adjustments so markers look good on maps:-P
---
Emm no people thought that side projects wouldn't be a main focus but it looks like they won't happen at all.
---
He clearly wanted to work on developing new games, so when NCSOFT came in and shut that party down, he likely started planning his departure.  I do not see this as the herald of future layoffs, rather its the long tail from the first round.
---
except its what the chinese community has been clamoring against. They tried a cantha area already, now its a crater in D.R. Dont be so sure we'll even get cantha at all, and that isnt a bad thing. New content is always more interesting.
---
Do you have any more detailed data? I'm fascinated by the idea that a 14 year old PC can run modern games with good performance. [Do you have something like this?](https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/how-does-the-ultimate-pc-of-10-years-ago-compare-to-the-best-today-1289479)
---
One of the first outfits, the Flamekissed outfit, was first made on the base of one of the human cultural armors.
---
That created such a backlash that they apologized and redesigned the armor: [https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/info/news/Flamekissed-Armor-Skin](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/info/news/Flamekissed-Armor-Skin)
---
So yes, they have admitted mistakes in the past.
---
MO hasn't had a lot of hands-on interaction with day-to-day directing/managing of development since Mike Z took over those duties so I don't think much will change if at all on that front.
---
I also have played it for last few weeks/month. With sanctuary last tueday as well for quicker cc. Worked fine with and without it.
---
Yeah, you can do that. Sure, but support rarely if ever used 3 shades. They'd carry Sand Savant which is where this whole problem stems from. With 3 shades you can still cover your group if you move and cover someone that strays while you can cover yourself since now you can't pulse out shade abilities on your own. 
---
Healing Scourge needs to be retuned then to 3 shades and change it's style a bit to compensate this change. Doesn't make me happy about it and it's still really.... stupid.
---
That doesn't mean they admitted to be wrong, just the usual "we're listening to feedback" and re-added it.
---
She was fired by ArenaNET for being a psycho.
---
Interesting, looks like a solid team, and goodness knows great games have come from far less. Can't wait to see what they come up with.

&gt; I still wish we could have a candid conversation about what Mo wanted (or didn't want) from the game
---
I really wish one of the people who have left took the table with them. No more "nothing is off the table" BS.
---
Exit strategy.
---
I watched the whole guild chat aswell, what was unclear about my problem with it?
---
Meh. She stopped being of any relevance the moment that... wait, when was she relevant again?
---
That wasn't just due to the forums, it was due to a wave of negative press coverage.
---
Reading the replies on that tweet really makes you rethink if democracy was such a good idea.
---
Well, if people needs further proof that this game is nearing its end, this should be it.
---
Honestly, I'd rather have Mike O' and the rest of the original team away from NCSoft and even away from the GW universe if that means they can give us something like GW1 again.
---
Best of luck to him.
---
You’re right! It was a twitter source!
---
I'm not sure how well I'm following the discussion anymore so Im going to try to reply again.
---
You're saying that it shouldn't be a problem for me to switch stats manually on my weapons when I change a build?
---
Well with the current arc templates I can have access to situational weapons and have the templates also switch my weapons stats/sigils. With the official templates I will have to choose either-or.
---
That's not what I meant. I meant you put your singular support shade on the group, thereby healing them whilst you leave the group to handle a mechanic, healing them but not yourself, and then you return.
---
Ah, this rando asshat again. It takes a special sort of person to twist something like this towards their own crazy ideals.

Is there any available cpu that you can run with "average settings" with character models and quality @ high or higher , in a WvW zerg or World boss with over 50fps and without an horrible frametime ?
---
Afaik , you can use dx912 , any new cpu available since gw2 was launched and .. you wont.
---
Cause the way your worded your answer it seems like you can now buy a desktop cpu , overclock to 4.5+Ghz and enjoy 60+fps with character model/limit on high+ in worldbosses or WvW zergs , and that doesn't happen.
---
Why would you want more power ? my  second rig ( 2500k + GTx 760 ) is barelly used in any scenario with lots of ppl.
---
You think the 9600k with the 2070 will make a big diference in all the places where the engine stuggles ?? ( it doesn't, I do get more fps in PvE but as soon as there are ppl arround frametime just goes up )
---
OP should just do what everyone does , accept this engine cannot scale and it's on it's limit when facing lots of ppl , and lower character model quality/limit .
---
First time i heard this    it sounded nice   R.I.P ill never get to experience it

Good luck with future projects! Greatness has come from far less (Team Cherry and Hollow Knight comes to mind), so I have high hopes for whatever your next idea is.
---
they said 3 to start and you have waaaay too many options on 1 character. you should make an alt toon. Power should be 1 toon, condi another. You should only need 6 templates max per toon and if you want more make alt toons. 1)Open world PVE, 2)Fractals, 3)dungeons, 4)PVP, 5)WvW, 6)Raids. (i thought i counted 7 before what did i miss?) I'd assume once you unlock templates its account wide, but knowing anet that's wrong, they need money.
---
I thought my 4 FULL sets of gear on one toon was bad, but you guys. WOW!
---
I mean i do have 18 toons so far ( yea i know minor league) but rather then haul around 8 sets on one i just make multiple classes and buy extra toon slots. 3 memsers so far :D
---
Freeing inventory is great I have many toons that don't have max bags cause i can't afford for all my alts to have it.
---
arcdps is still CHEAT MODE and gives advantages to those that don't have it installed, for those of us who don't want to RISK the 1-2% chance something bad will happen with an update to our 7 year old account.  :D ANet should just make a simple visual dps meter that you can turn on/off from the options menu. Since now arcdps has found its way outside of raids and is in all GAMEMODES! Golem dps testing isn't enough and doesn't reflect real circumstances while fighting bosses and showing yourself how to improve. Not having it installed is a REAL DISADVANTAGE!
---
I'm semi-hardcore Always Active Addict but i value my **PVE 7 year account** more then the 10% of the time i do raids and would like to use dps meters, but don't trust it.
---
I mean, it's JP, she's probably one of the disgusting and insane human beings out there, so of course she's making a party now that this happens.
---
If this is your mockup then you should point out this more clearly because people like to get wrong ideas
---
Probably just spying on capitalistic pigs.
---
I love Guild Wars as much as the next 14 year veteran.  But, with no GW3 in sight, I will be def watching this studio as this game ages out.
---
We have a special needs child so we're never going to be able to do dungeons, too many interruptions and not knowing if we'll come back. We did have a good community experience the other day when we were able to get people together to do legendary corrupted facet for her griffon mount. Unfortunately, I had to report someone yesterday who was saying some very closed-minded and bigoted stuff against lgbt people in /say but that was one of the few times since launch I've had to do that. Just glad my other child wasn't online to see it.
---
&gt;The only issue is they're too severely undermanned right now to pull off a full blown expansion anytime soon
---
What?
---
What a nasty human being she is.
---
They just laid off nearly half their team months ago.
---
Twitter bans all kind of stuff, sometimes its so random, but this shit person gets away with like everything, really baffles my mind.
---
I'm confused as to why this is all bad. You are guaranteed to have 3 shades/1 big shade up at all times because the duration is longer than the cool down. All this affects is the Scourge's mobility.
---
They'll work out fixes for Sand Shroud and then we won't have problems anymore. The class will be played differently, but overall because of higher target counts on shades, we will be more effective both in pve and pvp.
---
imagine still being this salty
---
what does she even do now
---
she radiates the lack of intelligence
---
Then by that argument, the trade-off of big shade was not having one of the other two grandmasters, so it was clearly not lacking in trade-offs before. But that is clearly not what I was talking about.
---
Taking the big shade (or any grandmaster trait) should always be strictly better than not taking *any* grandmaster trait at all. They should not be horizontally different, they should be better. If big shade is to stay as a grandmaster trait, then it should be a strict upgrade to the specialization over not having a grandmaster trait.
---
If you don't want that to be the case, then the option to have big shade should not take up a grandmaster slot, since the purpose of grandmaster traits is to make you strictly more powerful than without any grandmaster trait.
---
&gt;just throwing accusations and suggestions about him only because he is a white male without giving any evidence?
---
It's the fact she loves doing this that many hated when she got hired, she was fired from somewhere else for similar reasons and even made fun of TotalBiscuit's death.
---
meh ... can't we get something new? Why does everything to be retreads over old things from GW1?
---
You bought GW2 , and spent additional funds on it. You should feel cheated thrice over.
---
I'm gonna be honest here, I thought he was out of his depth for awhile.  But he always seemed like a nice, classy guy, so I wish him the best.
---
Having current means, that could be done with slightly modified [Treasure Hunting Kit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Treasure_Hunting_Kit) (no proximity circle, only direction pulse so this could be bit challenging) working for all maps and Branded Rift type of instances that could spawn at the found location.
---
Could be done within Side Stories/Current Events feature - as repeatable daily achievement
---
I will be very interested to see what they plan.
---
Considering the recent releases that have a much stronger connection with the GW1 world (I get it, the base GW2 world was set in the exact same pieces of land of GW1 - but it seemed like they were doing everything in their power to not acknowledge GW1 things, so as to not confuse newcomers to the series.) I could see it happening.
---
Especially because the Echowald and Jade Sea were some extremely unique environments and I could imagine their designers and artists would be chomping at the bits with how to re-envision them with modern graphics capabilities.
---
How did "1 Korean producer" metastasize  into an entire "chinese community"?

---
Her remark also has a nice aftertaste of racism too.
---
Copper is the first you should get as a new player.
---
There are many reasons that this project may not work.
---
As many said before, its hard to find this amount of good teams. Nobody gonna watch casual/bad teams, you need good ones. Also if you wont have such good spectator system as Teapot had (~reserving a "spectator" squad spot with a free cam game hack) it not gonna work. Nobody gonna watch summaries or gameplays which were recorded weeks ago. You need a live show with a good presenter and the ability to switch the live view between the two racing team. Also your price pool is about nothing yet, you would had to announce this with already having a big amount of stuffs. (and then you dont need entry fee).
---
This project seems te be a big step back compared to Teapot's ERP.
---
I think nobody should donate this project until its not started properly cause there is a good chance that your donated stuffs will be wasted on project that has no real community interest (eg. ~viewers).
---
Depends on your definition of "just". Takes a bit of time to gather people and form a company.
---
Copper-fed is a great convenience item.
---
Runecrafters has some situational uses but, unless you're gonna break out a spreadsheet I have never gotten the impression that it's worth it.
---
Silver-fed is generally not worth it. Only time it's worth it is if you have been salvaging so many rares that you run out of mystic forge stones to make mystic salvage kits.
---
Rofl she is the gift that keeps on giving.
---
Maybe in WvW but that was already a massive clusterfuck. Shades were great for extending a Scourges reach in the event that people would stray from the group for a mechanic or for another reason or just because they liked to stay away a bit.
---
The ONLY game mechanic in this combat system that promotes stacking is inherently a problem with the way the boon system works. Which makes it an intricate flaw of the combat system as a whole. Not the shades.
---
Why are QoL features not ok to monetize? Gw2 players are pretty entitled, as seen from the downvotes. 'I need every new feature for free 100%, or anet is toxic' - gw2 veteran players, 2019
---
What's the pay per word?
---
Yes well GW1 also looks like Gothic. Gothic 1 to be precise. There'd be no excuse for its performance on modern hardware to be anything less than perfectly smooth 60FPS (limit for its times).
---
I dont really wanna get too much involved in these kind of topics, but your comment just picked a string with me. Do you have a source? Is there someone who would do such a thing? I mean, even the worst of people like Hitler had some redeeming qualities (apparently he liked kids, animals and was a good son, not that it excuses everything else, but still, there is a human behind every face). 
---
I just dont want to form an opinion without seeing what exactly qualifies as "celebrated". Thanks in advanced.
---
GaMe Is DeAd!!!1!!one Go play FFXIV or OWC. Uptybalts to the left.
---
&gt; Let's be 100% honest, this game is nowhere near the vision of the game we were once told anymore, it took a completely different turn and i honestly feel O'Brien disagreed with it deep down.
---
Well if we are being honest I would say it is nearly all down hill starting from launch.
---
My sympathys to them
---
You mean like every media outlet and university in the United States? Plus one of the two biggest political parties?
---
Wow that's wild.
---
Every person on there works for ArenaNet. In addition to the three you mentioned:
---
* Elvir Bahtijaragic - a Technical Director with the studio since 2014
---
* Sarah Sperry - Started in QA in 2013, now a Design Lead
---
* Lisa Davis - Couldn't find a start date, but [she's listed as a Designer in HoT launch credits.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_credits)
---
* Kirill Federspiel - [3D/Environmental artist going back to at least Guild Wars: Factions](https://www.artstation.com/kirilli40/profile)
---
It was mostly a joke, but I appreciate you taking me so seriously.
---
The Jade Sea, Shing Jea, and the cramped, claustrophobic city made for some interesting areas. And they wouldn't have to contrive something lore-wise. 
---
I'm all for new areas too though.
---
I thought I killed you at the end of HoT?
---
My fractal main was at first DPS Guard (Core, as I hate DH) and then moved to Power QB as I had a Druid friend to run with, but they quit so I've been pretty lax on my fractal play.
---
I liked heal scourge because it didn't play like a pure support / heal build,but more like DPS with added utility of barrier, might, heals and cleanse.  I suspect the mechanics change ultimately kills that, so I'm back to playing Guard.
---
Working on Leg armor on my Rev though, so might just try Alacrigade, eventhough Renegade seems quite boring to play.
---
My issue with Reaper has always been similar to my hangup with Holo, that being, you suck when not in Hulk mode.  Having fun for those brief few moments when you're in Reaper shroud and then autoattacking / Gravedigger until you have the LF to go back in didn't seem all that engaging to me. 
---
I love running around in OW on Scourge, even in power gear, just melting mobs for quick heart completion.  So sad.
---
Traits period should never have trade-offs. Traits should be a way to modify abilities to suit your need. Not fuck you over for not taking a specific one. 
---
That's the problems with traits right now. Some traits are more than obviously better no matter what then the other choices on that column. Then there are piss traits that all they do is give you 2 seconds of a boon on a 45 second cooldown or do something just as stupid like activate an attack on fall damage.
---
Probably not. MMO and small studio doesn't look like the right combo.
---
haha, even if you were joking, I'm sure some people were probably thinking that seriously, unfortunately!
---
It's likely too late to change how the system works now. The loadouts store the gear instead using it from the inventory. That frees a lot of inventory space, but makes it a pointless waste for those using that inventory to keep the gear for their builds.
---
Further improvements will have to be done down the line to make the system more alt-friendly 
---
Hopefully they'll listen to feedback and adjust the system by the time they release the PvP templates.
---
except... you can't save your gear set in a build template(thats just traits).
---
You would have to swap each piece of your gear for your 3rd build into one of your gear templates.... changing the template.
---
Hahaha.
---
&gt; I wonder what she thinks about her father
---
I bet she's one of those spoiled american daddy little princesses that later as an adult discover that life is hard and ungrateful and thus, blames own social maladjustment on the patriarchy which is guilty of everything and at the same time embraces "third-wave feminism" which holds answer to everything and gives the light in her miserable life.
---
Also, I doubt she has any offspring - and better she doesn't.
---
https://twitter.com/delafina777/status/1000045432007938048?lang=en
---
She's a piece of shit as always.
---
Anecdotal stories like yours hold no weight because the underlying problem is still present.
---
Yeah some people are fine with how it is right now, but there are others who don't like it.
---
It's about the collective good, not catering to just one group of people.
---
All *good* companies work on creating new products. If you stay on only one, you eventually will lose a revenue rather than gain revenue and die. He was doing what was his responsibility as CEO - to take care of the company and direct it. 
---
The layoffs, to me, likely are a result of the fact that mobile gaming profits have seriously eaten into general MMO profits, so NCSoft cut slack that wasn't making them money now and moved new projects to mobile-only ones that are closer to release.
---
okay, what the fuck?!
---

---
There was a short period during HoT days when they accidentally disabled this feature, resulting in character skin also inheriting the light from the environment. People were not happy, let's put it that way. They fixed it in the hotfix the next day or so.
---
I don't think I have any screenshots of that, but just trust me: what we have now, it's better this way.
---
If you are only going to get one: runecrafter
---
If you are going to get two: copper and silver
---
If you are going to get three: ...
---
Build temple- ResidentSleeper
---
Jumped off the sinking ship huh?
---
copper fed is used the most.  you are usually salvaging a lot of blues and greens for mats without really carrying about extra percentage chances, just cheap salvaging to clear inventory really.  the rest of the infinite kits are too situational to justify the buy unless you have gems to burn i think.
---
I got the same impression from what I've seen. I'm already blocked, guess I follow the wrong people... never interacted with her.
---
Also hilarious because there is a few trans people vigorously defending her and still salty about her being fired for being an asshat
---
Well they can even stop release new things on Gw2, you don't need new update because you already happy with what you have. It's exactly your point in your comment. See how dumb it is ?
---
I can't wait to play the game where you pay irl money for a chair and then you get it and you can sit in it. Nice game...
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/delafina777/status/1000045432007938048?lang=en
---
&gt; e: After making this thread, the official forums thread has now become un-frozen without comments from ANet or the mods.
---
Then are you sure it was frozen ? Do they even have this function ? It could have been a caching issue or anything (and by caching I mean server side or somewhere in between, not necessarily your own browser cache)
---
edit : also stop the drama. They did acknowledge that something was wrong (changed the gemstore banner asap), and support is refunding people who think they were fooled. They're doing it right.
---
Good man! Following what heart says.
---
Judging by the track record that NCSoft happens to have I wouldn't second-guess leaked correspondence that would put the blame on them.
---
like an Ex that just wont let go
---
It is sad to read and i was hoping you would stick around a while longer but since you kind of took a step back i knew it would happen at some point. 
---
Either way i really wish you the best in the future and with your new compnay and i also hope that your new game you work on will have success. I will certainly keep an eye on it :)
---
Thank you for actually providing not only *constructive* criticism, but also proposing a well thought out solution.
---
Stop supporting this game they barely put out content and they're trying to suck your wallets dry like vampires.
---
For God Sake, someone get that "human" out of social networks for 6 months. Really...
---
Change isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I'm excited to see what direction ArenaNet will go in without Mike O'Brien at the helm and what direction ManaWorks will go in-terms of an indie game studio.  I feel that Mike O'Brien had to step-in and perch over Mike Z for a lot of community outreach, PR and direction.  I think Mike Z is warming up to his role at game director and that Mike O leaving will give him a lot more of an opportunity to carve out his own vision for the future of the game.  
---
Mike created a Guild Wars dynasty split between Guild Wars: Prophecies, Factions, Nightfall, EoTN, and of course, GW2.  He essentially spent 20 years on this series.  That is a quarter of someone's life.  That is nothing other than an extraordinary display of passion, dedication and resolve.  I'll be looking forward to see what ManaWorks is up to!  I'm still excited about GW2, but I'm taking it steady and living my own life.  I'm glad Mike's starting a new adventure too.
---
What are the chances that Season 5 is the final season of GW2?
---
Founders/CEOs/Presidents leave their company all the time, either due to being tired of running it, burned out, wanting something new, etc.
---
MO is a programmer at heart, being stuck just running a company is probably not something he wanted to solely do. If you look at the stub site for the new studio, [https://mana.works](https://mana.works), you'll notice that he's listed there as a programmer. He probably just wanted to go back to making games and getting his hands dirty in the tech.
---
A third. They still have 200+ people, and there is still some sort of unannounced "thing" being worked on by the fourth team, though I doubt it's an expansion.
---
Mike's transition out was probably being planned for at least a month prior.
---
dont lump psychopaths in with that crazy. they have at least some standards /s
---
Leave this game while you can they are money vampires trying to suck your wallet dry.
---
it works
---
That's not radical feminism. That's just being an asshole.
---
This is how i see it: 
---
https://youtu.be/gBzJGckMYO4
---
This game went way downhill after he left
---
At this point she is more meme than human. She is like an old, senile, racist family member. You don't take them seriously, best to wait for them to finish ranting, and when they have blown themselves out carry on.
---
I think that would be a smaller leap (to a better solution) than them rewriting the system in the last ~3 weeks to allow for all the changes needed to meet community's needs.
---
Very happy!
---
Can now easily swap between raid weaver and WvW staff weaver with a hotkey instead of double-clicking on staff in inventory. Or swap between power reaper and power scourge with a hotkey without opening trait panel. And so many other. Quality of life! That hotkey makes build templates totally worth it.
---
I wasn't intending to suggest that GW2 scales well, but the scaling beyond 2 cores is entirely real and complaining about performance on 2cores, especially ones designed for low power usage, is just silly.
---
OP would likely easily gain 2X or more FPS in zergs if he moved from his **dual core low power cpu** to pretty well any ***intel*** 4 core desktop part **from the last 7+ years**. You're not wrong about performance though, realistically your zerg fps is pretty well entirely dictated by the single threaded performance of 2\~ cores **but** even in these situations the game+system total cpu count usage is still above 2 cores, the scaling is there(vs 2) before said scaling jumps off a cliff.
---
Look at JP's twitter she is back to say "Mike o brien evil white man , bring wamen now"
---
RIP Anet and GW 😭
---
Thank you for the amazing moments of my life!!!
---
oh that's so cool. Good luck to everything!!
---
You play WvW in full berserker with no stun break?
---
Yes, I'm sure, since this thread stayed timestamp-frozen despite many people making comments on it - as you can see on the screenshot. I get you want to think good of ANet, but in this case, you're being too naive. 
---
They "doing it right" would mean actually making some kind of acknowledgement of the issue and perhaps an apology as well. Trying to sweep the whole thing under the rug and hoping no one will notice (and thus, wanting for people to buy more of the chair) is what I'm against here.
---
And i agree that this is not a good thing and can only have hopes that the Americans realised how bad this is for their country and for the world. 
---
But this is the whole point though, you still have the vote to use at the next election. No one is taking that voice from you and this is really important and took hundreds of years of work to change this. 
---
And we are lucky to be in the part of the world were it still is going on were you still can speak your mind and vote and be the person you want to be. In other parts of the world you can not.
---
No, your lack of understanding as to why I am happy with templates is dumb. Go bother someone else.
---
You, sir, are an idiot.
---
This is way too fucking funny and I can't help but steal it while the Mike flair is still available, sorry. Just wanted to apologize for my meme thievery
---
good luck with the new plans MO &amp; team from manaworks, i hope you cook up something really good. :)
---
I have it on good authority he was working on several from within ArenaNet.
---
&gt;sprinkling of misogyny about JP 
---
That person who got laid off for being an arrogant, self-important asshole on twitter? the same one that was glad when TB died? wow people are so mean &gt;:(
---
Yup, found all of them on LinkedIn except Lisa Davis. So basically MO is taking some *current* gw2 staff with him, not devs who left Anet with the layoffs or longer ago. It's sad news for gw2.
---
I regret not getting the runecrafter one.
---
I have copper and silver but it's the best IMO if you're only gonna have 1.
---
and one of those enabling her in the comments is a former GW2 reddit mod
---
Y I K E S
---
I understand that you want to do it. But BEFORE you still had to swap them manually if you used them like you said (from what I understood) you've used them. At that point you dont need to include those weapons in the templates and you still change them from inventory. Nothing changes. I don't know what your problem is. That you don't get one more inv slot for that? uh...
---
Open world builds are the opportunity to experiment with fun abilities.
---
I went from an i7-3770k, 16gb DDR3 onto a 3800X 16GB DDR 3600. I can't say I see any difference in FPS when it comes to GW (not using any mods). Both PCs use he same GPU - GTX1070
---
literally anything before GW2 was announced
---
Yes but at that point the weapons dont swap stats and I have to do it manually everytime I change a build. 
---
Lets take w5 for example.
---
I start as cweaver on SH, we then move onto river and I switch to healer, I switch sigils and stats on my dagger and wh. Then we move onto statues and we do eyes, at that point I have to go power dps and change the stats and sigils on my sword and dagger. Then we move onto dhuum and I have to change back to cweaver and again change the stats on my dagger.
---
With current arc templates I dont have to manually change any of the stats and I still have the weapons in inventory for situational use. With the new templates it will be either-or.
---
shes definitely not making video games anymore so she probably has a lot of time on her hands.
---
We did not want this in WvW. We wanted the opposit were they nerfed the scourges to a point were the fights would be fun again. And then split it with PvE were they can drown things in condi for all i care, it is PvE everything is scripted so more condi, more damage YAY, but WvW please no, and they buffed it instead....
---
&gt; more likely would make ppl realize it is not as good as they remembered.
---
Yeah that's why Clasic WoW was such a massive failure. Not like it shattered records on twitch and is hardcarrying WoW to the top of the list of most profitable PC games or something..
---
GW1 is still there. I still log in from time to time and it's *better* than I remembered because I'm old enough to fully appreciate it now.
---
angry? i am not angry at all. MO is a very smart person and i think he has done the right thing for his life to be successful.  
---
just because i do not like certain development means that i am angry or whatever. and spreading some bs like "he never wanted to do that" on reddit is like idk. yes, thats exactly what he wanted to do, else he wouldn't have done it and for so long with the skills he has, get real.
---
Same
---
That is one major QoL upgrade!. Just tried it out, I thought map competition had gotten as easy as it will get, but this will help even more. Thanks!
---
They did acknowledge by fixing it, and they're doing what must be done toward customer that were fooled. And it's not like there is the slightest change "no one will notice". You can be upset that the issue existed in the first place and talk about it, because they need to know that they have to make better visuals in the future ... but going on with drama about how they handle the issue is not good imho. Had they refused to refund, I'd be with you.
---
The only problem i have is that the games you are making are coming out probably years from now... i can't wait to see them : )
---
"fixed a bug with the chair scaling"
---
It's a fucking chair inside a video game that you are expected to pay real money for. That's the difference.
---
10 years ago this statement would've sounded absurd, btw. But this is where we are.
---
That’s true, but I think most games showing up as an endgame player looks very limited.
---
No.
---
above 2*
---
You only get 2(technically one extra, as we already have one) gear "template".
---
that sort of thing is why I left there - the mods make it so toxic.
---
Being a radical anything is never a positive.
---
I bought HoT and Living World Season 2 but I most likely won't be buying anything else in the future unless things improve.
---
Alternate title: anet tries to put fire out using gasoline
---
Oh gosh, I want to wish you guys and gals the best of luck, I'm really looking forward to everything and anything you make as I'm already sure it's going to be fantastic.
---
What was the original design, if you remember? I never actually took the deck to any big-banner tournaments like SCG or a GP, but it won Game Day and did pretty well in the standard environment (including beating the meta decks at the time like Abzan Midrange). Part of it was just catching people off-guard by virtue of being a homebrew (Brimaz attacking and being able to convoke Devouring Light) but Warden was surprisingly good. White doesn't usually get access to something as efficient as a 4/4 for 3 so he kind blasted through stuff like [Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=442153) which stonewalled a lot of aggressive decks.
---
NCSoft assuming full control.
---
Soon she won't let you... LOL
---
Can't say I blame them. No one wants to read that INCESSANT whining.
---
You're tellin me.  I've even been kicked from raid squads before while in the middle of loading into the aerodrome because comms have exactly 0% patience.
---
Maybe if this game wasn't such an unoptimized POS, a SSD wouldn't be so essential.
---
&gt;One person on the internet who do and say crazy things do not equal what everybody else does
---
But it's increasingly common for those types to get more airtime than literally anything else. There were articles put out *every day* sticking up for this psychotic cunt. Instead, people like these should be berated until they shut the fuck up, otherwise they inadvertently end up poisoning public opinion for quite some time.
---
So yeah, one person (really thousands were sticking up for her) saying stupid shit online means nothing. But when the majority are too lazy or cowardly to shut them up, they only have themselves to blame when this shit becomes commonplace.
---
what an asshat
---
I mean he literally announced it some time ago (I believe after long live the lich), I was actually surprised it didnt happen earlier this year, but that was probably because of the lay offs
---
I KNEW IT!
---
Breaking the mythology around game devs doing this out of passion instead of for a career doesn't make anyone an angry little person. This guy is bailing now because GW2 is past the point of salvaging and he's finally jumping off of a sinking ship, the feel good take elsewhere may make everyone feel better now but won't matter when this studio is shuttered.
---
Got the site saved, thx for the link!
---
&gt;She gives women in creative/tech a bad name. It's none of her business.
---
I played during her time on the team and clearly creative/tech ventures should have been none of her business either.
---
Here's a good trick to prevent that from happening...  put your wallet away.
---
I once posted something about the game in gw2 main forums like 6 years ago and got temp banned. I never post on gw2 forums since. Its like chinas censorship down there.
---
You mean like giving dead games every opportunity to recover before finally shuttering them? Yeah, what monsters.
---
Probably not that different from an incel tbh
---
&gt; What I want to know, is whether the monetization direction was brought by Mike OB
---
NCSoft via MOB, the person in charge of monetisation came from Nexon which at the time had a stake in NCSoft.
---
Two years ago...  
---
To focus on...  
---
New project development...  
---
NCsoft: knock knock...  
---
Bye bye devs...  
---
Bye MO...  
---
Bye???...
---
Jeweler 500 is on the future agenda.  Maybe they can do something like this.
---
Pull up a chair and sit down this is gonna take awhile.... oh
---
Its NCSOft undoubtedly assuming greater control of course its detrimental.
---
I wish I could hug and thank him for GW1 and initial GW2. I don't really like or enjoy the game but still.
---
&gt; Usable Build Templates at the moment: 1 
---
So.....gonna ignore arcdps i see.
---
Given what he did to her why should she feel any different?
---
I thought quitting threads weren't allowed? Can I have his stuff?
---
You have little reason to use Purge Gyro in pve to begin with. Not all skills are going to be equally suited for all game modes, and that wasn't any less true before this patch. That's why you have more skills than you can fit in your bar and why builds for the same class and spec look vastly different between game modes.
---
ah, so it's about stat/sigil changes, not just weapon swaps ok :D
---
143 may not quite be half of 400, but it's a far cry from "nowhere near."  
---
But yes, I'm sure the content release rate has declined and that an expansion announcement is just around the corner. Some day.
---
My pc is fairly old and I have a lot of trouble with beetle races and griffon stuff because im faster than objects load in sometimes. It sucks but then its maybe time for an upgrade lol.
---
The bullshit is not the fact that it costs money, but the price of it. I think 20 dollars for a mount skin is ridiculous as well.
---
You could've done that with arcdps, which had the blessing of ANet themselves, but sure.
---
Always good to be happy when one gets ripped off.
---
Right , I stand corrected.  
---
I got my numbers wrong.
---
That requires making a charr fursuit, which requires money *and* work.
---
Colin took the table with him to Amazon. They've been trying to clean everything off it for two years now.
---
It's sad to see one of the OG developers go. I ultimately don't have an opinion about Mike's policies or performance because I'm a casual player and take frequent breaks. 🤷🏾‍♀️
---
This is what's necessary for speed kills, lowmans and mechanics skipping. I did a few of them, that's a category of fun on its own. Elitist fun, for sure.
---
A third is nowhere near half, so yes.
---
Forget about OC on the Ryzen 3000
---
Yet the screenshot says otherwise?
---
Actually, Mike stepped down to form another studio with friends and colleagues to work on passion projects. It was probably in the works for a while. The layoffs were by the hand of NCSoft, but I don't think this is.
---
I am happy too. I dislike lugging many gear sets around so I already splits them in between characters of the same class. With the change, I can upgrade to 2-3 builds per toon with ability to hot swap. Fairly convenient for my WvW toons.
---
Very little. People move on from companies, it sucks but it looks like GW2 is Arenanets main focus now after the layoffs and there are devs who wanted to move on and make new games. Look on the bright side when [Mana.works](https://Mana.works) game is released we have another game to play when we take breaks from GW2.
---
Well, he talks about the game, not about 3rd party tools.
---
&gt; but Anet knows their players 
---
So that's why they're infamous for ignoring feedback.
---
And here I was clinging onto the small hope that maybe one day you'd be on the balance team again to to bring us weird but fun meta shifts every few months like it used to be in GW. 
---
I know a lot of people probably know you because of that one Smiters Boon emergency nerf but as someone who played PvP since the early days of GW I'll remember you as the guy who gave me hours of fun and just as much laughs while playing.
---
Best of luck to you and your team for whatever the future may hold.
---
Yes, I'd love some of that to be done.  As it is, legendary trinkets really lose out.
---
I recall before this whole controversy happened I was browsing through her reddit comment history, largely because she actually *did* have interesting to say about narrative and I wanted to hear more. 
---
I remember noticing that she used the same account in /r/relationships (or some subreddit like that) where some woman was asking what she should do about her husband not wanting her kids to learn Spanish from their nanny or something like that. I recall Price mentioning that she grew up with a Latina nanny, so that would suggest she does come from affluence. 
---
This doesn't quite answer whether she was a 'daddy's little princess', maybe her dad was a total asshole, but she was probably not well prepared for a life of having to work to make her own living.
---
but i want to see steve 1st
---
It's dead.
---
Sounds pretty useless if you ask me. No impact on actual fight, just collecting worthless loot for hours that you can get in pve within 10 minutes with the same type of play style. 
---
Not to mention that you need to have allies that are actually contributing to fight so 50% of the time it's a complete waste of time.
---
&gt;(...) ANet doesn't work like that, they don't make their games so that something can fail to work as expected. That's not their design philosophy. They prevent the user from doing that thing in the first place.
---
Yeah, my point is that... they already have access to the guts of their game. I can also guess that they have a ***massive*** internal problem with DB logic and how everything is connected. That still doesn't answer my question on why they can't get around this issue, like they obviously did at the end, by having separate storage for the items in templates, and why on god's name this is limited to 26/account for the global storage.
---
&gt; 1) your clients are not children, ANet has different priorities and one of them is user friendliness above everything 
---
My point is that a company should never double charge a client for a mistake on their own implementation years behind them. 
---
&gt; 2) you likely do not have thousands of clients 
---
I work for a big 4 consulting company, I have most definitely worked for clients with less and more users than Anet has. 
---
&gt;  you likely do not **already** charge your client based on how much data they store on your servers 
---
Yes, because storing the data is not what we do, we handle the data, storing it is necessary for our product to work (at least on  my project). Anyone can get a cloud storage solution, that's not the point of the product, just as ***storing your gear is not the point of a game, it's being able to use it.***
---
I'm completely against QoL features being sold as opossed to actual content, since it creates a direct conflict of interests on the main thing that should be in a game: having fun. Selling QoL features like item storage, templates, slots, whatever you name it, means that periodically, some 10-15 people sit around at a table on the company's HQ to calculate exaclty ***how annoying they must develop and tune their features so that a precisely calculated % of players will be annoyed but not annoyed enough to quit the game, but annoyed just enough to give the company money to make the annoying stuff go away.*** 
---
QoL sales like build templates makes players pay so that the game is ***less annoying***, as opposed to paying for actual content to make their game ***more fun.***
---
I don't blame you for dislike the way she acts but your way of talking about it is very similair and i can't really respect that and i will take a step out of your topic.
---
I believe she is aware of that, but of course those awful women don't include her. I recall that she worked for Paizo previously and apparently got fired from their too for similar reasons, even when their CEO was a woman, so perhaps she thinks she's awful too.
---
Icebrood Saga can end up perfectly in a cliffhanger, Jormag dies and DSD or Primordus finally wake up. Anet confirms the end of Guild Wars 2 and confirms the next game. We continue the cliffhanger in the new game
---
This is the  main reason I was glad Gaile was gone. She was very agressivly toxic and coasted super hard on"IM A GW1 ICON", meanwhile  regularly ignored any attempt at community event leads trying to get anet to acknowledge events
---
Edit: I actually have some respect for at least the fact Rubi will still come out and do the guild chats etc. Even thou there's been shots fired from the community  and the responding to negative posts bit from a the post reveal, at least you still seem to try and find that middle ground and try and keep it positive so respect to you Rubi.
---
Yes and? It's a tool that ANet knew and allowed as long as they didn't make their own \[which they didn't for years\].  
---
But hey, if people want to pay for an inferior version of something we got free, they can do so.
---
Reddit
---
There may be some truth to this but don't forget that back then 3 of them would be in charge. Then 2 bailed, leaving MO alone at the top while the company was only getting bigger.
---
If he was solo from the beginning maybe he wouldn't have started it.
---
&gt;state of the game after Mike O'Brian leaving too?!
---
Would still be Texas for NA servers and Hesse for EU servers.
---
The companiy itself is located in Seattle, wich is the state of Washington
---
&gt; it took a completely different turn and i honestly feel O'Brien disagreed with it deep down
---
It's either this, or he really likes the game and is disappointed in the lack of popularity. I like Mike despite his faults, but I know he's smart enough to get off a sinking ship.
---
I'm radically in favor of the abolition of slavery. 
---
Am I bad?
---
I love the artwork of your characters on the page. I hope your new adventures stays with this theme.
---
"We had a Cantha district. It was built out. It was polished. It was beautiful. We kept getting feedback about the Asian market. And everyone was having a problem with it because the Chinese don't like having their architecture mixed with Koreans and the Koreans don't like having their architecture with the Chinese. And of course it's fantasy smorgosbord. It's gothic mixed with Nordic mixed with ... that's just the way fantasy works. But not over there apparently. So it got to the point where we were like ... well, what do we do with this spot? We don't have time to rebuild from scratch, so we just nuked it." = Josh Foreman, 2012. Your move.
---
Well Anet does love their gamma
---
Why do people talk about the side projects as bad things? GW2's been pretty done for years, something completely new and fresh would have been the best possible thing from ANet at this point. Dunno if the development was a shitshow or something but NCSoft's the one to blame for ruining any hope of getting anything interesting out of ANet evrr again now. MO and his pals clearly left because they want to actually do something creative and not just maintain a stagnant MMO that's just a vehicle for pushing mtx these days.
---
Not surprising. As I said at the time of the mass layoffs, NCSoft's readjustment of priorities would likely and ultimately come in GW2's favour. Mike evidently wanted to put GW2 to bed with a token devteam at most.
---
So while it's sad to see him go, ultimately this is likely to be in GW2's (if not the franchise in general) favour. However, consider that financials may be more important than ever for GW2, so think carefully before you pitchfork on the topic of monetisation.
---
Anet doesn't deserve linsey murdock lol
---
This change fucking cripples Support Scourge, and i'm angry.
---
Tbh i even skipped new years eve=D
---
Plus he needs an entire template system to swap one weapon.
---
more like 
---
Community: "Build templates were a basic GW1 feature that should have been included in GW2 at launch where are they?"
---
Anet: Charges gems, AND the system is terribly designed and very limited
---
Players: :O
---
&gt;but Anet knows their players.
---
They know their **casual** players.  They definitely do *not* know their hardcore players. Lmao
---
A 3/1 typically isn't too strong since it trades down so frequently, but if I had to hazard a guess I would imagine it got changed for two reasons:
---
Less likely: Wizards was printing fewer wraths in standard around this time, coming off the heels of Supreme Verdict in RTR-THS. Because of the way protection shapes the meta it makes wraths more important, and fewer of them means protection as a balance lever couldn't be running around as wantonly. 
---
More likely: This was this same time Wizards removed protection from evergreen status. Design team didn't like how protection hosed certain decks through no fault of their own so the design was phased out until recently. As of M20/ELD (which just came out) protection is back in niche situations, but given the context at the time I would imagine Warden was changed not for being too powerful, but because Wziards was simply trying to avoid unnecessary additions of protection, if that makes it feel any better. More likely to do with the standard environment than legacy power, though I'm not a legacy player so I could be totally wrong :)
---
being salty seems to be her main occupation
---
I'll give her a hand.
---
The closest things are either the custom gold/gem exchange mentioned below, or the mount adoption licenses. They didn't really admit they were wrong in either case, but they *did* change as a response to feedback.
---
What the departure of MO, is there anyone from the GW1 leadership team that is still remaining at ANet? Is ANet hitting a Blizzard problem where the entire crew is replaced save the name? Is the studio today considered ANet if the guard has fully changed? Is this why the direction of GW2 has been an antithesis to its original vision?
---
Because a-net already announced the meaximum number of build/gear templates you can hold. 
---
This limit should be increased, possibly after splitting gear template and storage features, if this is where problem is.
---
Slav-o-matic?
---
here- https://mana.works
---
If you have 10k gold maybe. Which is just insanity...
---
Tbh, Colin pushing for 2-week non-repeatable content was really bad and exhausting for the company ( and for some players ). He was not as good as most declare to remember.
---
This is not a backpiece, it's a shield. 
---
Meat Shield.
---
Poggies
---
It’ll be interesting to see what him and his team do at ManaWorks.  They have a small but great team already to build upon.  As for GW2, I don’t expect anything to change sadly.  More living story maps until nobody is left to play and the company is forced to make a new game.
---
Guild Wars 1 came from some of the key people behind Diablo II. I'm not sure I'd call that "far less."
---
Yeah god no not th druid stones pls, I also gave up on vision for now.
---
I'd love to have some sort of ‚shared armory equipment‘! I'd still love it more though if we got account shared gear blueprints as well - with both features available, the legendary gear would finally be the ultimate qol. :D
---
The bane of build templates is leaving, maybe the game will get even better now
---
Not the hero we need, but the hero we deserve.
---
"fixed an exploit which allowed players to use a smaller version of the chair"
---
I don't really want to start a long winded debate whether democracy is preferable to other alternatives or not. Just pointing out its not perfect, as many people seem to think
---
I meant to be asking why you think they set that limit, not why you believe in a limit existing, but you answered that already.
---
What if it is literally impossible for them to separate gear templates and the gear storage? I believe a developer mentioned that there is no reliable, user-friendly way to do that and the idea had too be dropped. Like, they knew that's what was wanted, tried to do it, couldn't, and had to settle for what we got.
---
If that's the case - what do you propose be done?
---
It probably will be, similar to account invantory slots. At first you could buy 5, then a few more, then a few more, etc..
---
There could be a technical limitation as to why they can only start with so many
---
Aw this is cool, i'm so excited Tirzah is part of your team also. \^\^
---
"We aim to create worlds to live in, skills to discover, and adventures to share with friends" and then to monetize it to the best of our abilities
---
I wish!
---
Get the fuck out of here with that kind of attitude.
---
I'm not proposing an alternative, just pointing out that democracy isn't perfect and the majority isn't always right
---
She's RIGHT, though.
---
it must be really hard to wake up in the morning and be that insufferable. her ENTIRE twitter feed is just her sitting around TRYING to find things to be outraged about and retweeting them. Where does she find the time in her day to do anything else? Must be mentally exhausting.
---
Is exactly why feminists will never be incharge :\]
---
Not surprising :)
---
What did she go off about? And what was the question?
---
For years, people posted on this sub they’d pay gems for templates extremely frequently. Now that it’s happening, another crowd refusing to pay gets vocal, that’s life, but the meme is actually right on point
---
here you go [directx 12](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=directx+12)
---
Could we maybe just once not go equally far off the deep end when the topic of JP is brought up here?
---
I would be willing to pay for templates. But just once, for unlimited templates, for the entire account.
---
Preferably as a feature released as part of an expansion that introduces Cantha and the Tengu as a playable race.
---
I use a quad core 6600 proccessor (which is the oldest piece along with the motherboard), 4GB ram (i think its ddr2, not at home so i cant check). And a GeForce GT440 1GB as graphic card. My HD is not an SSD. What else would u want to know?  
---
It can’t run the most modern games because it doesn’t even meet the minimum requirements of most of them (they require 6gb ram nowadays). But if it does, it’s fine.  
---
I really want to upgrade my pc but being this obsolete means I need to swap everything because nothing is compatible. New graphic card, motherboard, processor and ram all at the same time, and I don’t have that money.
---
How exciting that he's starting a new company with former Arenanet employees! Looking forward to seeing what adventures they have in store for us.
---
It can't hurt to finish your chapter to minimize the amount of things you need to replay afterwards (partial chapter progress might not be retained), but you don't need to, no.  You can just go to My Story and select the Heart of Thorns Prologue whenever you want.
---
Well, not while you're within an instance.  If you're in another story instance or your home instance or something like that, you can't change your active story.  In any open world zone, you can.
---
Wasn't eggpie a mod on this sub? Right? Or are you talking about gw 2's forums?
---
Fuckng chairs... Literally items you pay money for so that you can DO NOTHING with.

[ Salvage wars 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLrFPcTJeoM-QvYl49OwgEXHwfHVN_-R4aSKopr98xk)
---
thanks i needed a good laugh dude
---
Water isn't wet. It makes you wet. I thought you knew this!
---
I'll have it fixed for next build, but it'll be a few days
---
Omg so it has always been on the todo list , awesomesauce! and here I thought I was the only replying this idea xD , and yeah hopefully can be implemented easily since there.are.already options to keybind functionality with the addon
---
No the main bulk of work after Eye of the North of GW1 was moved to GW2 but there was a small team still on GW1 who made GW1 beyond which was an early version of the living world format and devs working on skill balance but effectively once Eye of the norths release major GW1 development stopped for GW2
---
What if I'm just plain radical, dude. \m/
---
The Grand Tour Game. That is not Colin's game though. He is on another project.
---
I give you the wonderful GW2 community.
---
Hoping he gets to work on something as good as GW1 is.
---
Between this and the build templates we should get 45 min WP video.... LOL
---
&gt; have to deal with moving the templates around with your character as you move through the existing megaserver infrastructure.
---
Don't know what that even means, but write it down into a list of features that  aren't worth it. They could have released the same autoclicker, working with just this character's bag and storing template data locally, with nice UI and promise to maintain it. Even charge some money for it, though not as much as for the current versions. People would be happy. 
---
&gt; raids effectively die, 
---
Raids? Pff, strike missions is where it is. No need for pesky optimized builds there! No raids, no problems.
---
MO is leaving and no one is being hired or promoted to replace him as CEO.
---
Previously: Z reported to MO, who in turn reported to Chris Corry of NCSoft.
---
Now: Z reports directly to Chris Corry of NCSoft.
---
NCSoft are effectively eliminating an entire link in that chain. By every definition, that's them consolidating more direct control over ArenaNet.
---
No one is saying that they're going to eliminate the ArenaNet brand or anything over the top like that, but they are using MO's resignation to exert more direct control.
---
Isn't Trump alot better than Bush and Obama thoug, Less bomb wars just more drama. At least Trum is better fit for office than Hillary.
---
I feel you man. I've given up explaining things to the white knights. It is what it is unfortunately.
---
has to be a valid link (with "http://") [Snowcrows](http://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/), [dT](http://discretize.eu)
---
Even if its entirely his decision if you don't think NCSoft will use it as an opportunity to assert greater control then I've got this bridge to sell you. There's also the fact that other major Arenanet players are leaving with him.
---
Newsflash. You're part of that community, too. :)
---
sadly it doesn't seem to have gotten better since she got shitcanned
---
I dont care about the trait and skill templates, they are fine other than that there is too few for people who go far with minmaxing.
---
I can use the equipment tab but that will edit the current gear loadout. And beyond that the order of items in the equipment tab will be bonkers. Atm I choose not to use the equipment tab because sometimes a random low quality geat gets in a slot between my use weapons and I have to open inventory to move where it isnt in the way. With the templates the order of items from top to bottom will be.
---
Gear in inventory - runes in gear template - armor in gear template - sigil in template - weapon in template - (if 2 weapons) sigil in template - weapon in template.
---
This means that every weapon will be under your greens whites etc. At the very bottom constantly shifting because of random equipment loot.
---
Now imagine you have 6 templates.
---
Still, it's kinda of sour. Ya know?
---
The majority of active players probably couldn't fathom what to do with seven gear slots.
---
The majority of active players only play open world and LS. A minority of players regularly play multiple game modes, and a smaller minority regularly play raids.
---
This doesn't mean I think it's great raiders are losing slots; those raiders are important to the game, but it's just not true that the majority of active players care about the limitations on this system.
---
She's a narcissist, there is no cure.  Medical professionals that deal with narcissists say they are incapable of changing, even if they truly want to change.  Just cut your ties with them and don't acknowledge anything they do (and they will likely talk bad about you because you no longer deal with them).
---
https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-disorders/narcissistic-personality-disorder.htm
---
Three big narcissistic traits that JP has: "Grandiose sense of self-importance", "Sense of entitlement", and "Frequently demeans, intimidates, bullies, or belittles others".
---
On a side note, narcissists can be really good workers in certain industries because of their drive to be the best.  However they usually need to be in charge (ie. CEO) or allowed to work independently.    Their ability to negatively effect others without empathy makes them good in positions where choices will affect a lot of people (ie. CEO).
---
&gt; For the karma
---
Not your part.
---
I really hope people will keep complaining about this non-stop, because it's an awful change that should be reverted. 
---
The whole shade mechanic now just feels bad. How does it makes sense that you use your class feature and then get screwed over when the situation changes slightly? Whenever you put down a shade now, you better make damn sure it's in the correct place - because if it isn't, or the "correct place" changes, you have now wasted not only a charge of your class mechanic and a cast time, but you also have to place ANOTHER ONE, because you can't just move yourself to where you want to use your goddamn shade abilities. Oh, and the new one you place won't even have desert shroud around it, since it wasn't there when you activated it. And if you're out of charges? Well that's too damn bad, isn't it, enjoy your useless life force now that the opponent moved 5 feet away from your immovable shades.
---
Fix the damn class ANet, this is hardly the first time the Necromancer gets shafted in all game modes for no good reason.
---
It's all one part. You're either in or you're not. Pick one.
---
Also, people envisioned the build templates to include the armor as a concept, not be separate systems. The gear templates are worth gems, not the build templates with what they are implementing.
---
See my reply to your other comment.
---
Difference is in the details.
---
So Isaiah Cartwright and Tirzah Bauer are also leaving, cause they are joining him in Manaworks.
---
Aww yeah, she knows at this point she's stuck with me! Mwa ha ha ha!
---
next thing you know they're gonna start shooting people in the chest and then arresting them
---
I agree. This needs more traction. But I'm afraid we won't get far. The subs in "template" mode and now more recently "oh shit, Mike O'"
---
PICNIC!!1!
---
I get the vibe that he likes to work on creating games, not maintaining them. GW1 was successful yet got axed 3 years in, at its prime.
---
Anet started the side projects around HoT, 3 years into GW2. Again.
---
It's fine to be like MO and seek variety, new challenges, but a CEO should do the opposite and commit to a product.
---
Again, no, NCSoft is not doing anything. 
---
MO left on his own accord from what we have been told, and nothing in the article you linked or otherwise says anything about the position being removed, except in the short term thing until it is filled again. Nothing *anywhere* says "no one is being hired or promoted to replace him as CEO" as you claim.
---
It doesn't even say Z reports direct to Corry - it just says he is going to keep overseeing GW2. That's it. He could step up and take MO's position, and hand his role as game director off to another person tomorrow.
---
Found the teenager
---
She was tweeting about her story work and Deroir commented that he thought that it would be better if we as the player would get more conversation options. Price blew up saying that he was trying to mansplain her job etc.
---
Deroir's tweet: https://twitter.com/DeroirGaming/status/1014280605599748096
---
She ended up getting fired by Mike: https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/586426#Comment_586426
---
Guild wars was also b2p...
---
Yeah I'm old, I love this mmo though and just wish the graphics engine were upgraded
---
Added in the latest build.
---
That is the great thing about cosmetics, you don't have to buy them.
---
Paying isn't the outrage, it's that the system is WORSE than what Arc offers for FREE. If it was the same system or better, much fewer people would have an issue.
---
Hahaha, her broom is trembling a lot :) &gt;!inb4yourthreadislocked!&lt;
---
I think he is also bringing Jessica Price as PR.
---
Get your trash out of here
---
With 2 great games under his belt already (and the previous work at Blizzard but there i can't say much without knowing stuff properly)  i am sure he will pull something truly awesome, with all the experience from what went right and what went wrong during the Anet ages. Fingers crossed, but i'll try to not hype it too much!  :P Best of luck to him and those who are following this new path. :-)
---
It seems that I am to stupid to change the flag from question to something else... Sorry for that, this is my second or third post here on reddit...
---
I'm old, too. Don't worry.
---
As for the graphics engine, it's fine as is. What it needs is better optimization but to do that it would be way to costly. I rather them focus on more important shit like actual good balance.
---
There was a study done that looked at the leadership and management abilities/styles of Men vs. Women leaders in a large business (multiple levels from manager to exec to ceo).  I can try and find the study if anyone is interested (I saw it on some TV show like 20/20 or Market Place).
---
I don't remember much of it, but two differences I do remember is that women leaders tend to be more emphatic to their employees (when in higher positions like CEO), and women leaders were shown to treat women subordinates more harshly than the male subordinates.  For the latter, I don't recall what the reasoning was but it stuck out as an interesting result.
---
Does anyone know if there are any women leading large game studios?  And if anyone has commented or written about their leadership styles versus men in the same company?
---
What are gamer gators?
---
Having a company president leave a company is pretty big news.
---
Don't worry, you can't change it here.  It's automatically assigned, but a mod can change it later.
---
Yay good people exist :)
---
What if a balance patch pops up in the middle of the league ?

You really should reconsider the duration .
---
Just my 2 ectos .
---
Yeah I don't think people know how incredibly talented he is and what he's brought to both Blizzard and Anet. Looking forward to see what he works on next. I hope he enjoys it, whatever it is.
---
Ah the trump gambit you're either with me or against me, no thanks. 
---
And If I may make a suggestion I suggets you step away from this thread you're not doing yourself any favours with your abusive responses to me and others.
---
Ty for the heads up!
---
Thanks... for destroying wvw.
---
What? 
---
Someone had to say it eventually...
---
City of Heroes was only profitable in the West during a time they were focusing primarily on Korea, people seem to forget this.
---
Anet should do content and let templates to arc
---
She is locked in place but still turns around.
---
27.
---
&gt; The in-game system had to happen one way or another because anet cannot rely on a third party software for the health of their community. If there is no in-game system, and arcdps shuts down, raids effectively die, possibly permanently. Making this system, even if it's not as powerful as arcdps, at least puts the health of the community in their own hands.
---
This kind of stuff is why I stopped posting on the official forums a long time ago.
---
Faith in humanity still not restored ghehe
---
But glad to see theres still good people!
---
I think its safe to assume had the layoofs not happen he would be with the company still, working on the unannounced projects. Ncsoft talimg that away from them meant he would go back to his laid back role in the company.
---
You don't have to level up gliding per-character.  You have to unlock gliding mastery once, account-wide, by starting the HoT story and getting the mastery XP to spend the point.
---
Once you've done that, everyone on your account can glide - same deal with the Pof mounts.  Once any character unlocks one, or gains a new mastery ability for one, every character on the account has it.
---
So just let arc template be, and stop defending stupid - expensive new features.
---
Arenanet hates necro, there isn't a point anymore. :(
---
DANG! I solve ALL my problems with different ways of standing!
---
I'm still salty over AutoAssault.
---
Easy. Not every treasure map guarantees a dungeon gate, some lead to just buried treasure kinda like what we have now in GW2 with the kits. 
---
Just sell guaranteed dungeon maps for 150 gems or so.
---
Had the same problem. I was unable to do it dozens of time. Gave up, started other things for Vision and forgot about it. Then came back to Dragonfall and ouch, i needed to finish it. Tbh i wanted to just farm these boots from pvp but one day i just got somehow boosted and dis it on first try xD. Just make sure your camera face Kralk cuz Aurene cant shoot on points which are not in front her. At 2 phase make sure to leave first point and start destroying second, cuz i was never able to destroy first one in time. 3 shots per point, dont wait till 3rd hits ;) also dont worry if you will not see achiev to pop out, you will got it at the end of instance. Wish you luck :)

Edit: typos
---
From Living Room to Living World, it's been a good run Mike
---
All I have to say is that you have a long and fun journey ahead  , hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did .
---
well, sounds like he made a good decision then.
---
**F**
---
It's Kotaku, so take this with around 5 oceans of salt.
---
I used the love the graphics but graphics in games have come a long way since GW2 released and I'd really like to see a better engine with better textures etc.
---
&gt;Anet owes you nothing.
---
Every argument along these lines is terrible. We're paying customers.
---
DICE tried, "If you don't like it, don't buy it," with Battlefield 5, and people listened. Oops.
---
Also, your argument is basically agreeing with them on the facts, but merely suggesting they shouldn't care. Which, to everyone who does care, sounds a lot like bolstering their points.
---
&gt; O’Brien is one of eight developers leaving the studio...
---
I say this semi jokingly but be careful introducing her to the Clocktower. It is a beast and I've seen some interesting things come from it. Most players deem it impossible and think its the worst thing ever. I had one friend refuse to let it beat her and she practiced it nonstop til she could beat it. The JP is truly magical is how it forces players to learn it or cry.
---
I’m sad MO is leaving anet. I’m sad we won’t see what him and his team had been working on for a few years. But I am excited to see what he will create in the future with his small team of friends. A new company and opportunity await. 
---
I would like to thank Mike O’ for all of the years of enjoyment I got out of his two amazing games. Guild Wars 1 got me into PC gaming and kept me there. I will patiently wait for his next game and hope to get years of enjoyment out of it as well. 
---
Thanks again for all the years of fun!
---
If they give me 3 build/3 equipment and not some odd off ratios, I will be happy
---
Oh my god that psycho is still blathering on?
---
Already discussed in his announcement thread; there's a list of developers going to work at ManaWorks.
---
Polymock arena before they patched void jumping.
---
Liek a baws LOL .
---
Another shitty inaccurate meme
---
And you know when he says he wants to make games with this friends again he means his old friend, Mike Morhaime. Well, I wish that were the case haha!
---
Unless ya'll didn't know that O'brien worked on WoW (or at least at blizzard, on a proprietary software packaging instruction set: .MPQ).
---
You were allowed to use arc for free. Onlynow you will be able to pay for templates. Anet will make sick money on them even ignoring the whiners.
---
Yeah the community reaction for this has been well overblown
---
You can buy the Ebon Vanguard shoulders and the High Legion weapons from the TP. Also, you get two from the reward tracks. 
---
As for decorations, your guild members can get it for you or you can pay people to temporarily enter your guild and pay them.
---
No one cares about the mini's. But if you do, you get Chilis from the reward tracks to buy the mini's and recipes.
---
We still allow article links from Kotaku? The infamous site that routinely has adware/malicious software on their site. Also the same site that does nothing but click bait titles?
---
:(
---
You're just as bad as her then.
---
[ManaWork Devs](https://mana.works/About.html)
---
The Sith now in complete control.
---
I'm quite pleased with what I saw in the demo from ArenaNet.  I'm super good to go with it :)
---
In particular, looking forward to using the same toon using different roles/builds in PvE vs WvW.
---
We'll be watching, Cartwright...
---
Thread removed: Not relevant to Guild Wars 2.
---
I’ll definitely be interesting in playing whatever game his new company creates.
---
"new world"
---
An mmo about settling the western hemisphere.
---
Interesting idea, not necessarily groundbreaking though. 
---
Not that we know much yet
---
This right here, i dont know why people even bother with the forums anymore, if your not right up anets ass then you can expect to be ban hammered or your topic deleted, they have some of the worst moderation ive seen on a forum, they dont even try to hide it now, i stopped using the forums along time ago, anet dont care what we have to say on there, unless its, We love you anet, the x item in the gem store is great anet.
---
Oakheart's Essence
---
I didn't know how to use Skyscale (especially without it's masteries) back then and the fact that after I dismounted I lost it (since I just borrowed them) drove me crazy. It is possible to get this POI with just Oakheart's Essence. I did it on my first map completion on my main character.
---
Edit: There might be also other one. If you use these lava craters to jump high, you can mount Griffon and use it to  get on this ship which goes around map. For this one timing and patience are important. This ship is going near that place and then you can just go over there using other mounts. If I have time I will check this one to confirm or debunk that.
---
Okay so I said chinese first because I knew they were part of it, and missed out an entirely different community. Where exactly does that cancel out the chinese community backlash? So because I dont use the word "entire" that means i must mean the entire community? Youre pretty damn assuming there man. Might I add this quote completely supports my claim, and negates yours, so I dunno why youre arguing.
---
Why'd you have to bring politics into this? You got nothing. Which isn't surprising coming from someone who defends a pathetic excuse for a human being like Jessica Price by basically parroting what other idiots say.
---
don't make sound like TotalBiscuit was a saint.
---
Kotaku was the site that recently uncovered the utter debacle that was going down behind the scenes at BioWare. Say what you want about the site and the majority of their posts, they do have some actual journalistic connections.
---
But ANet is one of the most inclusive companies in the industry. If she'd worked almost anywhere else, I'd see your point, but... ANet. They have issues with transparency, with decisionmaking, likely more... but gender discrimination is not one of them.
---
I expect special dialogue for Norn players but thats it
---
They don't need to do new things to GW2, they need to move on to GW3. It's time.
---
I hope MO joins the ones that were layoff and create something cooler than gw2 BUT without NCSOFT behind so the can't layoff people ever again. I want a full super-adventure game! Now, I'm serious on this because I want MO to keep in touch with his friends. I hated that so much people was laidoff so this is a chance to work again with some of them. And if that makes MO happy, I'll be happy as well.
---
I wonder if they can use the info or assets of the games that were cancelled, hm.
---
Just a quick follow up: I play with a GW2Hook sharpening overlay. Is that what's meant by "no modding," or is that referring to photoshopy stuff?
---
Okey, I see people not understanding how people can use more than 3 templated, this also was a huge drama kind of thing on one of the mapchats, so , I am mainly a DPS player but I play chrono in raids and fractals when I need to this means:  
---
For chrono -   1. Around 1300 toughness if we have FB/cWeaver + equeal assassins pieces to get somewhat close to   
---
critcap.(Duel/Insp/Chro), Pact
---
2. 1800 Tanking for bosses like SH or if we go solo heal for vg or something, Leadership ( -- II --)
---
3. 1005 tanking for bosses like VG(--II--) Pact
---
4. Pug tank for VG 1500 toughness + using focus + focus trait in inspi + para sigil in my shield Leadership
---
5. Basic Fractal chrono(Illu/Insp/Chro) Diviner and Commander mix, Pact
---
6. Plebs need carry in fracs Full harrier with focus + focus trait + chaos for the healing skill 
---
7. No healer(its dead basically, but was a thing some time ago)
---
8. Condi chrono supp
---
And these are ONLY the support ones, I also have a condi dps chrono, 2 power dps chrono, illusions mirage(nightmare rune), illusions mirage with scepter(Preplexinity(? no clue about its name) rune) for largos ALSO some Open World builds.
---
But as I tried to show its not just that okey, you have 8 build templated but most of them is just changing 1 chestpiece, because NO, for all of these changes I would need to go into character, change stats, change runes then change trait or even more traits.   
---
Also people have this thing in them that okey you change only once then you run with that for the whole raid, NO, W4 for example you go with condi there, then switch to a base toughness on with almost full dps traits and such and 15-20% after that you switch back to a normal chrono build with 1k toughness and around 60% BD, then for deimos OMG if they do full ranged you go high as you can and trait everything for sustain, if they are normal you just go 1300 and things like this.
---
I myself am not a hard-core player but I have a lot of builds, like, I actually woudnt be able to even describe my build name "Pog Portal for Pugs". Its a build for portals on Spirit Vale, but at the end i just need to switch my elite to the Mass Invis and use it, because the other things are already traited
---
And oh hell, I have a lot of build templates for weaver, there is condi- earth/arcane power- btth/FA tempest for escort healing tempest, might bot tempest
---
Okey, i will not tell other ones like my rev or DH, but the thing is, I do a lot of build templates, it makes me to ignore that shady place in my bag where all my armor and trinkets and sigils and stuff are, and i can concentrate on for example talking with the other chrono for taking fixations on sama or SH and things like this
---
Now, for someone who runs around in open world, does story, kills world bosses, hunts for achievements , sometimes maybe some T4s and CMs ,they need one or two, worst case 3 builds. So why would the people who are like me live with a build template that wants us to pay for it if we want to play the game in a higher level. Like, what should I do? Tank everything in one set and blame the healer for no might and protection who is on his full magi set because build templates doesnt let him more, and blame the DPS that they play mixed condi/power comp because some of them are stuck on condi some not, like okey these kind of case never will happen, but it mirrors what ANet does to the higher end people, they basically lock them down till then dont start to milk
---
I understand everything whos upset about all this, in ANet´s place I would ask for like 1-1.5k gems for the build templates itself, and after you buy it, you have as much space as you want and do with it whatever you want. Making it so called "free" to who it will be a benefit? To the new player whos level 50 has a lot of random drops in a bag? Or the new player who wants to get into raids? Yeah sure, that person should get into raids with one build and one character.
---
last words: It has a lot of typo and probably thing you will not even understand, so dont mind me, just a half hebrew comment is coming thru
---
This is clearly what happened; however, it's still kind of an odd response, given the optics, right? Regardless of whether this issue matters to me or you or whoever, it clearly puts out a bad taste during a kind of turbulent time. I don't know the bureaucracy and decision making processes at Arenanet, but it just seems like resizing chair shouldn't be such a hassle. If it *is* that much of a hassle for them, that seems kind of problematic anyway.
---
This effects anyone who wants to get more into the endgame content of fractals and raids.  Deciding to play three or more classes can make this system a complete nightmare.  Also, Fractal potions give 15% extra boon duration and ~10% extra crit chance at 150 agony resistance.  People notice these extra stats and do tend to work around them once they get their permanent potions.
---
&gt;For a free to use feature it's great; the company has to monetize SOMETHING, so putting a price tag on minor convenience that most people wouldn't benefit from anyways eems like a good way to go.
---
For a free feature, it dicks over the people who would want to use it by being so limiting and doesn't really benefit the people who don't even play endgame content.  Yes, they have to monetize something, but leave QoL features, especially features that are highly requested, has a 3rd party mod that does it really well, only to have the official version of it to have less features than the free addon.
---
Tirzah? Tirzah!??!?!?! She's my favourite gw2 map maker! Love Tirzah :D
---
It is so sad to see how she just fell for insanity. I don't know if that's a usual american issue that you can't afford treating mental diseases or if she is just lurking arround in wrong communities. Either way she has some serious issues and it's always a pitty to see people like her turn into such... things.
---
The cost model is shitty seems to be the main concern. 
---
I don't think anyone is shocked some will cost money, but the cost model.is pretty bad.
---
"comparable to existing options". So...since it could be anywhere from 1 to 60 items ( from the devs, including infusions and all that junk) it will probably start at 400 or more and, since "the max is 60" could be as much as 1200 gems per gear template. It probably won't be, but 400-500 is a safe bet.
---
they make money every time new stuff hits the gem store. why not have the traits/skills be unlimited and free and the item template to store items in cost money as well as letting arcdps keep making the templates that they are.
---
