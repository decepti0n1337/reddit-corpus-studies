Dungeons took a very hurt, plz get it work Arenaman.

---
---
Because MMO's are dying and rightfully so. The model doesn't really work with the nature of people. You can engage more people with less content (look at games like Fortnight). 
---

---
If you want a good RPG, go back to single player ones.
---
ANet did kinda shoot themselves in the foot for ones like us, cause we can just get gold for anything we really want from the Gemstore.
---
Tbh PoF woulda been a lot better if the other gods didn t just randomly decide to take the piss out of the fucking God of War for no reason. Only so that we would have to kill him. When he was trying to help.
---
I guess you haven't been on reddit the last couple of days but they are currently disabled.
---
Converting gems is not content
---
*Hopes something goes horribly wrong*
---
Nope. Not even close, especially with ANet's track record.
---
Why did they get disabled?
---
No lag from southern Sweden

---
What everyone has said.  Even looking up job reviews on Arenanet says the same thing.  Great talent, underpaid in the industry, subpar management.
---
&gt; It's not that simple, they would have to rebuild the backpiece mode almostl completely
---
Lol no. It's texture work, they wouldn't even need to touch the model at all. Even more, for those backpacks with glider counterparts, it's pretty much a copy+paste of the existing dye channels.
---
For those with no dyeable glider counterpart, you'd need to update the texture with the masks for the dye channels, which is not that big of a deal. It's not happening because they want you to buy the new ones, which will be dyeable. Same reason why many of the first gliders they released couldn't be dyed: Monetization.
---
Yeah, it gets better. The personal story is basically dog shit and I don't really get people that enjoy it. I think Woodenpotatoes has done the best possible job in presenting the personal story as something palatable in his let's play series. But outside of that, it's hot garbage. Essentially: each release gets better. Eventually, around season 3 or path of fire, it gets really fuckin good. Note, you can't play season 1. It is unavailable because of the way they were originally doing content releases at launch. Season 2 is okay... Heart of Thorns is pretty good as far as story, but that's mostly because the gameplay kicks up to something that is actually... well a fucking video game. Heart of Thorns as far as MAP content go, is fucking exceptional. The writing though is pretty mid tier, but it's a good place to start, because it really starts to ramp up in quality from there. Season 3 is all over the place, but generally a step up. Path of fire is fucking excellent. It's a different flavor of open world content than Heart of Thorns and explores a different approach to what end game looks like. The story, however, is excellent comparatively. Season 4 is great.

I miss my dear Red Lobster the Blue Crab.
---
So what do you expect instead, videos about PvP builds or raid kills?
---
Ha, you almost sound like you believe this subreddit is about a videogame! Ha ha! *crying inside*
---
Nice
---
So what is the fix? Limiting number of banners able to be spawned at once or somethin? Seems like just a fun christmas thing too, rip
---
Ah, I understand. I've had bad experiences with the other guild in the past. They're not the most mature group.
---
There's well over a thousand banners in that screenshot, that's more than an entire map of warriors could generate under normal circumstances.
---
Cad Bane is a bounty hunter from the Star Wars Universe, that I recreated (cosplay) in Guild Wars 2. My original thoughts were not all commanders are lawfully good, what if the death of a friend in the Personal Story changed the commander to become gritter. This is the story of Cad Bane in Guild Wars 2. 
---
We periodically make a variety of videos.  Right now, I've been getting more into music videos. I was inspired by Sammpo years ago.  Noxxi, also inspired me to make parodies or meme videos.  I try to make each video better than the previous one, I'm not at their level but I want to keep getting better.
---
thank you! they are!
---
I didn’t know, neat
---
well, if you're calling your guild SCUM, you're probably not taking the game overly seriously lol.
---
This feature is the sole reason my ranger has this rune over other power runes. I use a Smokescale named Smoke Dog and together with the Rock Dog we roam the open world and WvW as the very rare (have never seen another one) 2-pet ranger.
---
I misread that as a "bone removal pet"
---
We need it
---
Not all heroes wear capes! /salute
---
I sent you a DM on Reddit. Do you need me to do it in game? 
---
Either way, thanks for sharing! I would love a code
---
DM me.
---
Im the only one who thinks thats kinda sad that so many of those promo codes never got used as intended .... most of those used are those ones, where someone posts several stacks of them on Reddit, by people who play this game already anyway.
---
I'll take a code if u got one. Insite.3624
---
Soulbeast is great to adjust. I suggest not taking longbow. Lb has not much to offer after a quick big hit. Dagger, Axe, also warhorn is very good, there is also the slight troll version of axe offhand. 
---
You can treat gs as a weapon you can camp and then go axe axe for burst or a defensive combo like with dagger or axe +warhorn. I love the smokescale utility, for the troll build with oneshot from axe 5 you want more than one knockdown or immobilize (e.g. jacaranda has good skills, or a forage pet if you want to go that way).
---
In my understanding a soulbeast should be able to fight for a while, so you want regen from shouts and a pet heal skill, wilderness survival for all defensive aspects. You want to naturally swap pets to use all skills while bursting merged.
---
I don't know how you play it, but it is very beneficial if you get the upper hand in the jp games as well. 
---
A burst is dependent on hitting maul and f3, which are very visible and have long casts.
---
My noob burst was something around smokescale f2, f1 knockdown, maul (f3) and axe 5. Other than that it is 'trying' to do the pve rotation while not getting the important his on yourself.
---
Against condi classes you want to evade more than usual as cleansing is harder than on other jobs.
---
I would start adjusting boon beast build into what you want to have.
---
Another thing is, you have to work for boons instead of pressing frenzy. 
---
Example Might: warhorn, smokescale, elite shout and fast hits, merge with buffed pet, axe autos, positioning in teamfight.
---
I played with 2 stunbreaks or stability skills.
---
If you can tell me what issues you run into, i might be able to help you better. 
---
You would play sb very dependant on opponents skill, the said axe troll is more to catch uninformed people ( or stomp).
---
If you still have some, can you give me one? That would be very nice.
---
Would love 2 of these codes, one for me and another for my friend :3
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World is a good resource to know what you should look for your class/build while leveling or doing openworld stuff.
---
Can we DM for the crackers as well?
---
i'd say the easiest way would be to find a max lvl player, friend them to check their experience points, if over 5k or even 3k he probably knows more about the game than you so just ask him if he would like to help you learn the game. if he's not interested just keep hunting until u find someone that is
---
Best way to learn is just by playing and looking things up on the wiki when you don't understand them or asking in a guild / map chat when you need help or advice
---
You could also [try this new player guide on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide).
---
You could also [try this new player guide on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide) (made and updated very recently by /u/dak393).
---
DMing you, could use three if you have them (one for me and two for two friends).
---
Hey bro, got some for me? Sent you a DM, not sure if it reached
---
Open world encounters you do with multiple people who are on the same map, which often start at specific times, like world bosses on the basic game or the core maps from HoT extension.
---
i’d love to take one if you dont mind! i’ll DM you:)
---
I'd like a code please if you still have them
---
Are these US only? In any case could I have a code to try out? Thanks.
---
Fuck is your problem? Didn't I just say I pretty much did hearts and explore the map. That would suggest I only know how to do what I've said I've done so far. And no I couldn't have gone to the wiki as I had no idea this game had a wiki until just now.
---
I’d love to have a dm, thanks so much
---
If you're on a US server, hit me up in game on Vayne.8563. I help a lot of people learn the game. Keep in mind I'm fairly casual, at least in approach, but I can definitely get you started in the right direction.
---
Literally everything has a wiki.
---
Ok I think I've done a few of the basic ones. I thought you meant some kinda large scale open world kinda thing because I haven't seen any of those so far. But as I said ( or maybe I didn't) I play this game a few mins when I do log in. So in a month I might play 2 total hours.
---
It should be guaranteed, there's an achievement to collect all the festival teleport scrolls.
---
Hello, i just sent you a dm here on reddit, thanks so much
---
Would love a couple of codes for me and the wife
---
I dont need a code, but I'd  like to praise you as a true hero of the Tyrian community! We dont even have quizinos in the UK. We need more commanders in the field!
---
May I have one if they are still available?
---
I’ll take one from you. I don’t think we even have a Quizno’s around here anymore. Thanks!
---
Yea especially with PoF.
---
Though I miss HoT trains.
---
Hi thank you so much kind soul, would like to have 1
---
Pet Slothasor
---
I would love to get a code.  
---
Vissarion.6509
---
I’m good but thanks!
---
got mine, thanks!
---
Hero of the year right here!
---
I’ll take one if you still have some. Cheers!
---
I’ll gladly take a code off your hands!
---
I would like one, can you dm it to me here?
---
What do these codes do ? Sorry I'm not up to speed
---
They're for the Quiznos Icebrood Saga Hero's Bundle, which includes:
---
* Account-bound Mini Icebrood Saga Ogre
---
* Item Booster
---
* Karma Booster
---
* Experience Booster
---
* 10-slot bag
---
It's not much, but for a newer player, the bundle's pretty nice. Also it's an exclusive mini!
---
If you still have I'll take one, thanks
---
I'd like one!
---
On my phone trying to DM you but unable to figure it. If can spare one or two would you mind sending them, please
---
Several things to say:
---
* Elementalist is arguably the hardest to play well.  It's all about chaining your ability from one type to another constantly.  It's a squish class.  If you feel like you're dying too much, trying choosing gear with toughness (reduces damage) and vitality (increase health).  You may want to consider other professions.  You may want to consider Ranger.  Your pet can tank for you, so you can stay at a distance.  If something goes wrong, just run away.  It's probably the most keyboard/mouse friendly. 
---
* If you're unhappy playing with a keyboard/mouse, I'm not sure you're going to every be happy.  You can custom map keyboard and mouse to your liking.  I recommend un-mapping space and mapping \`E\` to dodge.  You'll want to be able to exactly trigger dodge to be effective.  You can play primarily with with a mouse, but you'll be a lot less effective than left hand on WASD and right hand on the mouse.
---
* The [GW2 Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page) has all the information on all the professions, traits and such.  An important tidbit is that your [traits are meant to have synergy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Attunement#Related_traits).  If you enable the trait [Arcane Prowess](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arcane_Prowess), when you switch attunments you'll get bonus damage for a short time.  So, you want to be constantly changing attunement.  Sites like [MetaBattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki) and [Snow Crows](https://snowcrows.com) have builds to try out.  They work because they consider the synergy of the build.  They'll talk about a "rotation," ie the ideal path of using your skills to maximize damage.  Don't get too caught up in that.  Just realize that skills have synergy, ie. "The third autoattack applies chill and with traits this means this now also applies bleed" or something.
---
* This game requires more skill than most games.  You need to dodge incoming damage and kite around mobs when your health gets low. Few professions can simply tank and spank mobs, only then as correctly spec'ed.  Part of game play is learning the telegraphs enemies give and get out of the way of damage.
---
* There is significant cost to death other than to waypoint and running to repair if your armor gets red, so learning what you can and cannot do is a good thing.  Sometimes you are just going to get in over your head.  Even at level 80, that happens from time to time.  Consider spending time killing lower-level mobs until you get comfortable up'ing your difficulty.  You'll still gain XP, so time is not wasted.
---
* Crafting is more an alt thing to do.  Don't worry about it until you're established enough that you have resources to burn on making high-end gear.  Nothing you can craft for less than 80 isn't cheaper by selling the materials on the Auction House and buying gear you want.  Do take advantage of the fact that you can sell to the Auction House from anywhere.  You'll make useful money selling gear and materials in your level range.
---
* Finally, gear is mostly gear.  Until level 65-70'ish, your damage is mostly going to be based on your weapon damage.  Try to use gear with power and ferocity, but more importantly just don't let your gear get more than 15-20 levels out of date.  It's worth buying on the AH *green* gear from the Auction House.  Don't buy rare or exotics.  You'll get some from leveling rewards, but it really wont make a difference until your 80 (when you get to working on replacing it all with real gear).
---
Yeah but temporary, you have no control on them (it’s basically its own AI) and with a long cooldown.
---
Oh right.  I actually already got a free code when that came out lol I don't need one thanks for the low down though
---
Can I get a code there please?
---
as a gw2 RPer pls don't think all RPers go to Salma to bar-p... ;-;
---
Can I have two? I have two friends who just started playing wth the free accounts. Thanks!
---
I'll take one if you've still got extras!
---
IDK man you're the one not telling the full story. Just ask the person who kicked you instead of crying about it on reddit.
---
There are good reasons to kick someone like that, such as: 
---
1. Joined on wrong role (heal when asking for DPS)
---
2. You are on someone's block list
---
3. Failure to ping ess
---
4. Insufficient AR
---
Hi do you still have more? DMing you rn
---
My rainbow phoenix in GW1 was in the Hall of Monuments last I checked. We are up north in the area, hopefully I can find it again, it seems to have gotten loose.
---
I haven't seen a Quiznos in several eons
---
I didn't say that I think that lol,  I've seen them just about everywhere. Just pointing out the surplus in that city.
---
I opend a chat with you :D
---
Press Y, add my name to your friends list, then right click my name and message me. Unless you're on a free account. IF that's the case, I'd have to add you first.
---
I'm on a regular account. I bought it back in 2012.
---
I’ll totally take one thanks man
---
Ok I added you, but I just logged out. I'll probably pop on after work tomorrow.
---
I sent you a dm. Thank you so much for giving these away!
---
Hey you still got any left? Only need 1 if you do
---
I can understand that.
---
What is it you're trying to learn?  I recently starting making some videos that might give you some perspective about what to do and how to play the game.  The videos won't teach you how to play an elementalist but they'll give you some info that you might find useful -- especially since it'll give you some perspective to what content you'll encounter a little later on.  The first video is a 35-minute rundown on the content that you can find in the game. 
---
Big overview of GW2:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-YUtNkjFWg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-YUtNkjFWg)

I also started a series of videos to look at the mechanics of the game a little bit deeper.  The first two videos are here.  The third should be out this upcoming weekend.  I wanted to take a break for a Wintersday video.

Let me know if you have any questions.
---
Isn't it trivial to craft Eternity once you have both? I could be wrong but I thought sunrise and twilight were the hard part.
---
I mean I'm surprised people are still playing GW2 outside of logging in once every 3 months tbh.
---
Fractals and raids are fun and all but I'm the kind of player that just do content once and then moves on.
---
NO worries then. You can just whisper me or mail me when you're on. Though tomorrow is my guild wintersday party so not sure how available I'll be. Starts at 9pm EST.
---
DM me if you still have these? Thank you so much!
---
To put it simply LW doesnt have any marketing impact...none at all. It just doesnt bring attention to the game, it keeps it afloat but barely and there is no playerbase growth. And it's getting even harder as this year will be full of new competitors in the MMO market. All the money NCSoft (almost 10million) sent to the west are all going into new Lineage, every single penny.I dont like what i've seen so far but it hasnt come out and it's already huge,even outside of asia. One of the best is gonna be Lost Ark and it's officially coming on EU and NA this year.  Realistically good luck keeping interest with small episodes and capes.....

I would like to have  one if you happen to have any extra left. Thank you for doing this in advance.
---
I’d love a code, thanks!
---
Hey man, go fuck yourself.
---
This probably the last big maintenance release. Then it's out to pasture like gw1.
---
Still a great game worth playing but no more big development.
---
Snowcrows discord has alot of players left for when you hit 80 and decide to start doing things, as for open world you can literally just do anything you want and take arcane shield and the trait that gives you an extra arcane shield and you'll find it pretty hard to be killed by things again. See [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Final\_Shielding](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Final_Shielding) for that one.
---
TL;DR links ; [https://discretize.eu/](https://discretize.eu/) &amp; [https://snowcrows.com/](https://snowcrows.com/) with [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main\_Page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page)
---
The crafting can get you some good account bound items but honestly the UI is horrible and ascended gear drops commonly in fractals and raids so I didnt really bother after my first year, if you want to craft its best to follow a guide on how to level quickly and use all the boosters you have [https://gw2crafts.net/](https://gw2crafts.net/) for help with that.
---
Gear wont matter till level 80, and when you do hit level 80 the stats that are most important for PVE on a power dps class are power (ofc), precision (makes you crit) and ferocity (makes critting actually do damage) while on condi which ele can also do you want condition damage and condition duration (expertise), usually viper stats which are locked to HoT expansion. Seriously you probably wont even have an exotic level 80 back for a while so dont worry about it.
---
Also you'll have every single build tree by level 80, its designed that way so the order you unlock things in, all up to you.
---
As for making a build when you hit level 80 it entirely depends on what content you do and what role you want to fill, snowcrows can help you alot there for pve activities while dT can help you with fractals. I haven't played pvp or WvW since PoF but I doubt much has changed from when it was just putting on as much toughness as you could and spamming condi on everybody.
---
Other than that, join a guild and keep asking questions.
---
messaged!
---
In which patch they changed it?
---
&gt; You're not wrong, you're just an asshole.
---
I recommend looking up WoodenPotatoe's guild wars 2 let's play. He starts with elementalist and he goes into extreme detail about how to play, build craft, explanations, lore, story, and it's legitimately high quality. I don't typically watch lp's and I watched the whole thing.
---
Don't know the best suited, but any will do.
---
Necro, Guardian and Ranger are all hard to kill, if you don't want to worry too much about staying alive go for these.
---
Some may say Warrior is meatier than Guardian, and while I can see why, my experience says the opposite. 
---
That said, the class that plays the best is always the one you like the most.
---
Gorrik and tiami.
---
So I can watch them die over and over and over again.
---
Great idea! Let's make it easier to avoid playing with others in an MMO!
---
Why not. People are dumb enough to buy fucking chairs.
---
🙄
---
Id love a code, thanks!
---
Well this promotion wasn't to get more quizno's eaters to play gw2, it was to get more gw2 players eating at quizno's.
---
DM me one pleasseeee.... ty
---
Selling them individually gets you around 4k.  Then You can buy eternity for like 3.5k.  So end up netting 500g afterwards.
---
Probably because those questions rather fit into the [Weekly question thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/eajihn/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_december_14/)
---
But people downvote for the strangest of reasons.
---
So many codes. if possible, I will be happy to get one.
---
I know right? They keep adding these traits that give you benefits regardless of whether or not you are actually using said trait-related skills yet Double Standards is still the way it is...
---
I would waste so much time if this were a thing 😅
---
I rather they work on the existing pets, especially core ones.
---
May I have one please? Thank you! If not, I understand.
---
PMed.
---
if u bought them from gem store u should get your gems back if u destroy the glyps and the tool it was in. Had the same done with the scales glyps of reping, got my gems back.
---
The wat? I literally have no idea what youre talking about since english is not my primary language but i know its just fueling the negativity
---
Thinking about giving the game a try once I ( hopefully ) get my account back. Can you play without having to participate in PVP?
---
Please
---
PvP is a separate game mode. Most people are pve only.
---
I am Canadian, and would like to re-affirm confirmation that 4 users ago is also Canadian. Yes, we know all 35M of us.

It is really sad. The pattern is clear and people who are denying it are either delusional or ignorant. If an MMO announces that they are moving away from Expansion-based content, contrary the fact that in the past they admitted that the original "only Living World" concept wasn't enough, then they are more or less admit the fact that the game is past its zenit. That's okay, that's acceptable since we are talking about a 7-8 year old game. The problem is that we are still being tricked into this conception that something great is coming down the road. Guild Wars 2 has become one of the poster child of the problems of today's gaming industry. Long story short endless cosmetic items, skins and less actual content. It is mindblowing how many players are living in a bubble, in a happy ingorant state and log in for every patch just to spend 2-3k gems on skins and then go back and autoattack open World bosses thinking they are part of something bigger. And then if it's pointed out they start yelling and instructing people to stop playing the game if they don't like it. I'm genuienly afraid that this attitude encourages developers to milk playerbases all around the world since part of the community protect their flawed system. We are at that point that if something is desired by the community and the studio \_generously\_ gives it to them FOR REAL MONEY, then they are convinced that anybody that is not grateful is a dumbass and should leave the game. This is due to the fact that they don't want to put effort and time into gameplay and it is easier and quciker just to buy something off the cash shop. That is why we had the uproar once Raids arrived. People were too lazy and ignorant to learn basic mechanics, rotation so they just said: its too hard, its too awkward, give me skins for dollars and we cool. And now here we are.
---
Was it a paid skin from the gemstore? If not, good luck...

The game will remind them itself ;) The personal story directs you to Arah as the very final part, after The Source of Orr.
---
Jewelcrafting is not a endgame profession. It's the only profession that levels only to rank 400 and is not able to craft ascended gear.
---
I'd like one if you have any left ^^
---
If you have one, I’ll take it. Ty
---
&gt;In any event, where can I get some info on how to really learn this game?
---
Here: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide

They never documented the change in the official patch notes, but this [reddit post 26 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dz1pnv/glyph_of_the_crucible_bugged_same_for_alchemy/) is the first mention that I can find.

That is one way to view it.  I bought these specifically for their ability to harvest the occasional varietal seed, so I feel differently.  I honestly don't have any other uses for these purchases that cost 2000 gems.
---
Thus far, ANET has declined to honor that request.
---
You want in-game earnable skins? Go for invisible shoes / Khan-Ur headgear - oh wait! These aren't earnable but pure rng.. This is worse than the light- / shadow-account thing (possibility of precurser drops) from years ago (or ist this still a thing since the collections dropped?)..
---
&gt;next expansion
---
...should we tell him?
---
If I'm not too late, got any more to send one my way? :D
---
..what? is the franchise *ending*?
---
There won't next expansion and the current living season is about Jormag, therefore frost and ice.
---
&gt; An update to the Hyena to make it look healthier
---
Please! My poor hyena's been so loyal all this time and I can't even take him to the Tyrian Animal Clinic to clear up that horrible mange. He's a good boy who deserves better.
---
&gt;next expansion 
---
Oh, you sweet Summer child
---
No unless they decide we don't fight Jormag in icebrood. I do predict a new expansion next year but in Cantha
---

He's using a machine with the possibility to obtain any piece of information mankind has ever known, and he would rather post and wait a day for a reply instead of finding out on his own like a grown ass human being.
---
Thing with crafting is that buying stuff is usually way cheaper then crafting it. Even for ascended items, you will probably prefer to get them as a drop from WvW/PvP and then reforging them in mystic toilet, then crafting a brand new item.

That being said, jewelcrafting is probably the least useful one - you can't craft ascended trinket with it, it doesn't give you access to t7 mat crafting like the rest of them, and orange trinkets are dirt cheap. Instead i would recommend you to switch to cooking - leveling it up from 1-400 will take you around 10 gold (with proper guide), leveling from 400-500 will take a bit more (100 gold if i remember correctly), but you can just unlock charr butchering and sylvary farming part of it and get access to quality red meat (10 silver on TP) as a drop from any animal and cultivated plants (up to 50 silver) as a drop from any herb nodes.

You can try playing in action camera mode https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Action_Camera_Mode
---
lol he deleted that comment
---
I'd love to get one, if you still have one to spare! Friend of mine would also be interested, but I understand, if you only want to hand out one.
---
I guess it's probably because in my current situation 100$ a month (or around 90-100€ in my case) is like a non negligible amount relative to the amount left after mandatory expanses and that I have verged on some kind of problematic behaviours in the past. So I do tend to worry a bit much on this topic :p
---
Where I am something roughly along the lines of a cable TV subscription is nowhere near that level and for the other examples it's not something I would usually value as worth this amount of money so would avoid (for reasons kinda related to above).
---
And yeah the "I need to have it all" is the part that made me post my message and worry me the most also linked to a lot of general issues about in-game transaction. 
---
&gt;Hell, there's a $27,000 pre launch buy in package for Star Citizen.
---
That would more register as a worry/problem than an actual "it's ok" point for me :p
---
i cant see my legendary skins in world pvp. i have to change equipment template manually for fixing this joke.
---
I thought about that, but doesn't that fall into the "Use this subreddit as an alternative way of contacting customer support" category, which is prohibited?  Anyway, I might post a follow up here with an update on this matter and title it like you suggested.  I also was genuinely hoping for a practical use for these glyphs that I might have overlooked, but sadly it seems like ANET took away the only use I have for these items.
---
Does the change make them better for raids too? Or is Weaver still preferred on most encounters?
---
Cheers for using something I've shared. xP
---
I was just talking to a friend yesterday who was thinking about buying it! You got a spare code i could give to him?
---
Great job sharing these
---
I'd like a horse.
---
Praise the Quiznos Gods. If there is any left, I would like one please. Thank you.
---
Any more of those available ?
---
Can i get that code? And second for my friend(
---
It honestly and unironically just had so much soul.
---
I'd love one
---
Oh boy, I can't wait until humans never ask each other questions, and then cease having conversations altogether! We'll just exist alongside one another, and extract everything we need from a lump of cold silicon in our palms instead.
---
It's not a topic of discussion or something that requires any specific individual to respond.   
---
It's literally asking "What is x?" and getting "x is y" as an output. Data.
---
How the f*** did you avoid those annoying invi walls?
---
Ill take one if you have any left!
---
Code plz and thx
---
Crafting isn't that important generally since for most things it is cheaper to buy the item you want from the trading post. There are 2 exceptions, because they're account bound:
---
1. Ascended weapons/armor, but it's generally quite expensive to craft this stuff. Raids and high level fractals, OTOH, drop this stuff like crazy and also give you the currency you can use to buy this equipment from vendors. You can also get ascended trinkets relatively easily from Living Story vendors (not that you can craft that yet, but trinkets give you more stats than armor - lots of people never stop using exotics for armor) and an easy ascended weapon can be gained per character who finished HoT and completes a fairly easy sidequest (though the type of weapon is a bit limited). You can also get a complete set of ascended armor (the precursor to legendary armor) by completing a set of raid collections. So most people might just craft their mainhand ascended weapon, grab a full set of ascended trinkets from living story, and then get into raids to start getting everything else (either doing the relatively easy precursor, getting lucky quickly with drops, or buying stuff with currency), and move into high tier fractals when they have enough ascended pieces for their agony resistance.
---
2. Some foods/utility items that are best in slot are accountbound and craftable only. Like Condi Firebrand uses Plate of Beef Rendang (Cooking) or Condi Boon Chrono uses Toxic Maintenance Oil (Huntsman). Using a cheaper or easier-to-get variant usually doesn't cause that big of a loss, though, in the effectiveness of your build.
---
If You still have some I'll be glad for a two - for me and by boyfriend (:
---
Your all-professions character can only have 2 crafting professions active at a time. After that, you have to pay to swap them around. The extra license just means you can have 3 crafting professions active at one time.
---
They're all pretty well balanced for your average PVE experienced. In raids and end-end-game content, there is a meta but for 90% of it anything goes as long as you're vaguely aware of what you're doing. There is definitely no trash-tier class. 
---
[This](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play) is a pretty good guide to the "feel" of a class. They all play a bit differently, so it's important to get one that feels right.
---
Thought you gonna show some new unique build, but it's just a regular sicem slb. :(
---
You don't have to stow the weapon, you can cancel animation just by walking in any direction.
---
I did ask, it's how I knew they were going to be thrown away. They also said you can take as many as you want since no one knows about it as stated in my message.
---
You can do the same just by walking in any direction.
---
Yeah, that's totally the reason why we're getting bite-sized saga episodes instead of an expansion...
---
Still can't believe it's gone =[
---
No your face is funny, it's like a little raisin
---
Next expansion is Gw2 - maintenance mode.
---
Hey. Have you got any left? In that case, may I have two?
---
I'll wait for your permission to DM you, in case!
---
Thanks in advance and great service for the community!
---
If you have some 1 left =&gt; holo.6329
---
When not its ok. Thank for your work to make some player happy.
---
Merry Christmas
---
Well yes, that's totally the reason. They want you to play regularly, so they release regularly. You have no value if you login for expansion, stay for a week, speedclear everything based on guide and then logout for months. If they make you login every month they win.
---
Awesome! Yeah, I always liked Cad Bane when I first saw him in Clone Wars I didn't understand why I liked him so much.  Then after watching and learning about him more, he became on of my favorites.  I don't know much about Embo and Aurea Sing is interesting.   I haven't seen The Mandalorian yet, since it's on Disney+ but I hope to see it one day soon :D.
---
One please
---
Any left? Just in case
---
noone ever said they are not.. they just didn't confirm that they are either
---
Well, remember that chairs update - something RP community craved for - was added as a "joke update" on April?  
---
Yeah, that's what we are to them. Don't expect much, if anything at all. Ideally, I'd prefer addon support like WoW has, a way to phase out from PvE players without RP mode enabled (Because they're very often disruptive for no good reason other than shitting on someone's fun), and something akin to radar that shows players with RP tag enabled on different instances, allowing you to mapjoin them to combat the megaserver isolation. Realistically, just this last thing would go miles, for PvE players too.
---
Can I have the biscuits please :3 ? :D
---
Man, would love to get a code thrown my way!
---
Nope.
---
The core game have a few map meta events. The Harathi Hinterlands for example have a long stack of events that lead up to a world boss. 
---
Later on in Orr at lvl 70 and forward all those maps pushing toward temple events. At lvl 80 you have Silver Waste which is only about meta event on the map and Dry top who move between sandstorm events and no sandstorm events.
---
As for worldbosses The Shatterer and Tequatl are those that are more then autoattack the others are fine too if you chaise loot and xp so if you pass one make them.
---
If you get the expansions (you only have to get Path of Fire and you get Heart of Thorns for free with that) then all HoT maps are meta maps with meta bosses in which are still very active. PoF have a few meta events but not as many and not as active but they are done if you want to make them. Several of the Season maps have meta events and world bosses that are still active.
---
Dungeons and especially story which is good to start with give you lots of xp and loot. First story dungeon is at lvl 30. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dungeon
---
The dungeons are old content but you can play them for gold, xp, skins and exotic gear and ofc story. At lvl 80 Fractals is the dungeons in this game https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractals_of_the_Mists
---
Use the lfg-tool to make a group and add it to the lfg-tool. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Looking_For_Group
---
The lfg-tool is used all over GW2 to jump maps so remember that it is there for later when you are at lvl 80.
---
As for how to play Ele. Well Ele is a bit complex to fully understand so give your self time to learn. It is worth the extra time. Ele swaps between atunaments a lot. In PvP and WvW you will use all your atunaments and swap around cooldowns. whilst in PvE as a dps not as much but you sill need to know the trix of that and combofields and so on. https://metabattle.com/wiki/Elementalist Have a lot of builds were you can click one of them and you get a guide on how to play, what gear, what skills and traits and explanations on when to use them.
---
When you level up always go for Berserker stats. They will be called Strong in the lower levels and then berserker higher up. It is power, precision and ferocity. It is dps stats which makes faster kills. Be aware of that ele have a low health pool so you can not face tank everything. Some times you need to think about position and having aoe ready were they will end up. CC is also something that you need to be aware of. Anything that slow, stun, fear, knocksdown and so on is important to remember. And use your heal or other things that helps you out. 
---
When i level a ele i usually use either dagger/dagger or dagger/focus  because it is very easy to tag your mobs and you have tons of aoe. I keep a staff in my bag and swap to that when doing meta events, worldbosses or other events that require more AoE and CC. 
---
With the expansions you get elite specs in which your elementalist can be played very differently. Tempest and Weaver. I will just mention this so you know why some eles you meet use skills you dont have.
---
Do  you have 1 for me? *-*
---
Instead of new pets, I think we need a Ranger specialization that while in battle, they have access to only one pet but that pet is fully grown rather than a juvenile.
---
I'd love 2 if you still have some! Thanks anyway! 3
---
changing the write permission of the .dat file might work but can bring a whole lot of trouble
---
Rainbow phoenix and Jellyfish on land!
---
I wouldn't. Everything but the executable itself is stored there. That includes WvW, updates to skins and whatnot that you also need for WvW.
---
He's right though
---
&gt; as I play on a 200 GB SSD
---
If upgrading that small SSD is out of the question but you have USB3, 64GB sticks that are fast and large enough are under $20. GW2 does not use any magic mumbo jumbo and should just run off one of those.
---
ello,
---
if you have any codes left over i'm interested in having one. thanks for donating them!
---
Anet, like always surprises us with very efficient business techniques. This marketing campaign was very successful it seems.
---
Ah alright, so it's the same for both old and new characters then. 
---
...but who would pay a shit ton of gems for an additional licence when the profession swap fee is literally a few silver?
---
WvW maps count as  necessary assets so I'm not being selective in only wanting to download them. If I log into the game in the playable state and select 'on demand' streaming it remains in the playable state. So playing the game seems to count as a pause button just as closing the client, and I don't see how it is unfeasible to do this using another way.
---
Good luck not getting banned for that.
---
Next chapter, the Commander finally gets sick of their shit and tells them to go fight Jormag on their own. They fail and realize they need him because their BS gets in the way. They each learn that they need to be better. 
---
Meanwhile, Commander is off playing poker in the Amnoon Casino.
---
The tokens go into the currency wallet not inventory, have your friend check there.
---
excuse me, next what?
---
Yeah, WvW uses a lot of the same assets as the rest of the game. Like not having the latest PvE map and thus the latest reward track downloaded might break the whole damn thing.
---
Getting a new cheap drive is the only thing I can recommend. You won't be getting any amazing speeds over USB2 but it'll work just the same.
---
The game wouldn't launch if I haven't downloaded all the necessary assets, that includes patches and hotfixes. I would just have to change the write permissions again, download the patch, re-change write permission, then play the game in the playable state. That's exactly the same as downloading the game then playing before downloading all the other assets.
---
What armour are you wearing?
---
If you have crafting lvl 500 the fee is 50 silver. Half a gold is quite a lot for new players.
---
But I agree it's mostly a trap, the price becomes negligible by the time you get to the point where you need to craft a lot
---
There is still one dev team that works on something unannounced.
---
Source? But most likely
---
Would love one pls!
---
To be honest, it's not really all *that* hard to type "gw2 new player guide" into google or youtube search, and you'll instantly get dozens of results on how to build your character, how to level up efficiently, how to make gold, how everything works in general, overall useful tips etc.
---
Coming to reddit and asking people for advice is by no means discouraged, but when people refer you to websites that can teach you a whole lot more than singular replies to your post can, saying "i have zero idea how to access a website" just makes you seem like a troll and/or an idiot.
---
I'd like one too, if I'm not too late to the party! Really nice of you to spend so much time on this.
---
Actually you can mess up gear/build wise in fractals and raids. Doing experimental-stuff in these two activities will result in a kick.
---

If you play on NA then pugs are indeed inefficient, even 250+kp pugs are often garbage and can't pull more than 22k on Arkk or more than 28k on Ensolyss, though i hear it's a lot different on EU, on NA i only ever see good parties if they're static/semi-statics.
---
As for mini-bosses there aren't that many that i can think of, and for mobs that die in 1s then yeah power pulls ahead in burst, though it's not like having 1 cFB  will significantly slow down things since they just instantly die, i'd say it can hold it's own unless you're doing world records which more people aren't doing on daily basis pugs.
---
Don't really have cFB logs as i'm usually stuck playing support since every pug only knows how to play dps but those were 200ess NA pugs: https://dps.report/2PtX-Seraph8_skor

Offheal fb with Seraph, sadly that's the average NA pug you'll find between 50-250ess, low dps and most don't know what cc means.
---
Was it a Chest of Dungeoneering by any chance? Those give selectable tokens and you get after completing 8 paths in any dungeons.
---
Even the destroyed version was better than the one we have now.
---
But hey, gotta sell them gem store lounge passes!
---
Wurms
---
politely threw the truth in their faces..... sounds polite.
---
It is a great day for Canada and therefore the world
---
Only in very experenced groups. Because 5% damage boost is not too signifcant + spirits die often.
---
Also, dungeon frequenter chest offers tokens of choice. Story mode itself does not, indeed.
---
nope, we already have player housing, it's those home node instances that keep populating your instance..... too bad you cannot place them wherever you want. :P
---
Besides the token from beating the explorable paths, you get a few tokens from killling the bosses (blue bags) and by completing achievements and some rare daylies. 
---
All that said, storymode isnt the best place to farm token.
---
Oh yes, you can also get tokens from SPVP and WVW reward tracks.
---
Omg OP pls... There is only one Quiznos here and it was so far away...
---
Yeah old LA was so much better :(
---
I highly doubt that $30 would cover the cost of developing an expansion. They also don't have to worry about reviews and retail space.
---
nice one!
---
I would love to receive a code!

---
* man i miss old LA
---
Did you do any of these dungeons when they were a Daily Achievement? The daily counts story mode like any other path and gives 100 tokens.
---
Better is subjective. I'm thoroughly enjoying FFXIV. It's not the same type of game, so tastes will vary as with anything.
---
Not a new idea. This mechanic is reused from Bitterfrost frontier.
---
Wow, a troll like you didnt even manage to write a single sentence.
---
Quiznos still exists?
---
Rainbow phoenix from gw1
---
Roll a tank and say goodbye to ever waiting for a queue again! (Also extra loot, the ability to set the pace and all the commendations you could ever want)
---
Those fetch quests can all go suck a dick though.
---
Jesus Im glad I have a decent static. Yesterday we were pulling well over 90k total dps, all three dps combined (since Banners were disabled, warrior was running dps. Made the DH mad cus he couldn't outdps the warrior. He's pretty competitive when it comes to dps, but it makes him better lol). I guess I forget what its like not to have a static lol
---
Playing strictly for rewards is roleplaying as skrit.
---
Would love 1 code if there's any left, thank you !
---
"Hello good sir.
---
I would love a Quiznos code if you have any leftover at this juncture.

Thank you for your time and sacrifice regardless of outcome.

Tried sending a mail ingame, but your Character name returned invalid and the mail was sent back to me when I tried your account name.

Cant be trusted to be useful at work without getting micromanaged, cant be trusted to be useful ingame without being micromanaged. Perhaps there is a reason people consistently feel the need to tell you what to do.

Best advice tbh.

Are there any left? I'd love to get one, thank you!

Keybind dodge. Dodge is an evade frame first, a mobility skill second. It will avoid most attacks during its 0.75s window. It should be used as an evade frame and not as a mobility spell 99.9% of the time.
---
I'd love this.
---
Old LA felt like an actual city built by pirates.  Reading Sea or Sorrow and about Cobiah Marriner's founding of the city really gives the old layout so much more depth.  I think the new LA is beautiful but the idea of pirates just cobbling a city together out of spare boats is a really cool idea.
---
I did this when walls was in place. Thanks for sharing yours!
---
Would like to get a code if you still have 1. 
---
VEgasmily.1723
---
There was a trick with skyscale made me to be able to go above those walls then continue to move to the top. That been patched. I looked through my screenshots folder and found  these, which I am more than happy to share.
---
The trick was a game breaking, you could "avoid any (no mount zone)" and reach to the end of any jumping puzzles. Which is understandable that been patched.
---
Yeah it doesn't seem to get much better after 50ess for pugging, it feels like people just put high kp as a barrier when they don't really care about the run, expect others to do everything and barely contribute at all while still acting as elitists if something goes wrong, people don't seem to understand how important CC and burst is and most just copy-paste builds without even reading what their skills do
---
this is so on point that I really believe these changes are coming from real pvp experience, the fucking clones in Mirage/mesmer are one of the most annoying thing about them, and finally Rampage is being nerfed, maybe now I can play my warrior without having to pick rampage for every build
---
They really need to update all core tyria skybox to at least HoT's skybox or PoF. In my best guess they wouldn't allocate resources to do so, It will just stay the same skybox forever, we could wish for it all we want. (Maybe Gw3)
---
there has to be a balance between deleting someone in 0,25 seconds and battling a bunker for 5 minutes,
---
Record killing can definitely be done without banners right? :)
---
Ha ha hee hee old LA, upvote to the left, game not dying.
---
So 75% of their teams are working on LW and we received....that? A prologue that was small (ok for a prologue) and fun, but episode 1 was really shitty. The story was super short, the map itself is super super short, even the encounters are basic.....a defend that event for 11 minutes and then a slow walking boss.

You can get 20 slots from candy corn vendor or from fractal vendors. You can also craft 20 and high from the new materials from Icebrood saga map bjora marches.
---
You got half of size for half the wait. It was just 2 months since last release, not typical 3-4 they were doing before. It is objectively same amount of stuff per time.
---
But ye, some events might get a bit more creative....
---
Karka! Chak, too.
---
Ah well, I'm pretty sure I missed out on these. I was hoping I could at least get one for my wife who's a new player and really likes minis. It's okay, you did a good thing here.
---
My favorite one was around the mystic toilet. It was in a perfect circle with equal spacing. Makes you wonder how it was exploited.
---
Candy cobs can be used to buy 20 slot bags.  20 slot bags are also available from the WvW vendor for 7 g and 350 Badges of Honor.   There are also several available from fractal vendors for a small amount of coin and fractal relics.  There are two collections that reward 20 slot bags, Uncanny Canner and Bandit Weapon Specialist.  There are a series of collections in the Sandswept Isles that can get you a 32 slot bag for cheaper than crafting.

This.

Whichever one you like the most!  They're all viable!  Some classes are more difficult to learn than others, but my advice is to choose the class you actually enjoy playing.  Don't play class X if you don't enjoy the play style of class X, just cuz it's the current meta.  You'll get annoyed and leave the game, doing that.  Elementalist isn't a meta class for anything (afaik), but it's what I play 90% of the time cuz it's what I enjoy!
---
PM Sent and thank you.

I only use the gem store to buy stuff I want for the amount I want to spend. Personally I feel I would buy a lot more stuff if it were cheaper but aside from that nothing is really stopping me from using the gem store.

Wow classic.

\&gt;  This elegant glider and matching backpack both feature four dye channels for you to customize. 
---
Looks like dyeable backpacks is the new thing now!
---
They may be aware, but, even in that case, they probably don't really care about those issues... So just laugh at 'em and be surprised and amazed when we get something like capes! By the way, if any ANet devs are reading this, please make a cape with quiver.
---
It needs to be buffed to at least 3s.
---
However, a few seconds of resistance can make the difference in a fight. It means that when engaging foes in PvP,  many off their defense strategies (blinds, immobs) will be useless while you deliver your burst.
---
I might even go far to say the original utility goggles with blind immunity was severely OP. So I'm not surprised it was nerfed not only in duration but with counter-play (boon strip) as well.
---
Is this worth buying if we own candy corn gobbler already?
---
New patch, new cape. /mooo
---
Worth it if we own candy corn gobbler?
---
If nothing goes catastrophically wrong, it'll be fixed with the initial wintersday release.
---
In unrelated news, it'll be fixed with a later hotfix.
---
25% reward track seems like pay-to-win levels of significant.
---
Nobody. They don't play engineer and make random changes to give an illusion of balance updates.
---
&gt; * Wintersday Gift rewards from the Winter Wonderland jumping puzzle's hardest route have been decreased from 15 to 12 per completion.
---
wtf.... It's the only thing from the festival that felt personal skill was being rewarded.
---
How about an actual customizable player home with ingredients garden, pet ranch, story achievement/fractal/raid/dungeons trophy room not the jumbo mess of outdated node farm instance we have right now?
---
I mean, you have got most of that in GW1. You could even assign their positions with little flags.
---
For a short while, festival decorations for both Wintersday and Lunar New Year activated at the same time - with collision and all. Post-processing didn't kick in, but hey, it did lag as much as if both festivals were running together!
---
I think all routes should give the same amount, actually.  Hard route is too easy. Easier than other routes actually.
---
i know, just making a comment.
---
sometimes, so probably specefic cases :3 might not be your case
---
Warriors always have a place because of their banners. Engineers are more variable but are capable as DPS.
---
Now I just want a snowflake glyph so I can get snowflakes year round without using consumable tools.
---
It's a different boost, so it should stack.
---
YES!
---
What's the point of placeholders for balance? The skill itself was garbage, trait was OK. They changed it only coz they updated the toolbelt skill, looked at the main skill and thought "Huh, this skill is untouched since the release except it's recharge time"
---
More P2W items. Nice.
---
Milking whatever is left out of this.
---
It's the fact that is costs gems that makes it P2W since it (along with the candy corn gobbler) gives clear advantage to those who spends cash. If this was only available ingame then it'd make sense.
---
give me a one pls im poor!

It gives a different, unique and stackable buff.
---
Should stack. So yes for a WvW Player.
---
So what happens when you buy it with in game gold? Do I not win?
---
Why would this be pay to win ?
---
Getting that pw2 in your face cause anets needs to milk you as much as they kan before this games goes in maintenance mode in a year...
---
Next year: "it's not bad, 9 vs 12"
---
Another year after: *crickests of dead game*
---
Because are soo P2W and were never a thing in GW2's gemshop, right?
---
Not cash store -&gt; low priority
---
Yea I always did the hard or middle route because I found then easier. The snow flake melting speed doesn't really matter when you have a time limit with the freezing mechanic anyway so it comes down to which snow flake layout you like best.
---
That's not what he said, he said it'll be fixed in the first hotfix, if nothing goes catastrophically wrong: https://i.imgur.com/lqh3z99.png
---
Of course. Wanna bet how many capes we will get as in-game content rewards? :):):)
---
SOMEBODY TOUCHA MY SPAGHET
---
https://services.staticwars.com/gw2/img/content/2f20ea81_splash.jpg
---
That skyscale looks so fucking smug I love it
---
Pay to get shinies faster, but not really a gameplay advantage.
---
Why is there a huge quiver lying on the grass behind you
---
Happy new year. May 2020 be a better year.
---
if you buy with in game gold you are not spending that gold in in game items or materials that you need for some progress... Making the whole thing becoming pay to win, because you are giving players the option of an unfair advantage.
---
shhh they need a reason to be angry to live
---
let them have this
---
Maybe they can update the Candy Corn Gobbler to act similarly? Oh wait nevermind, sorry! I forgot they never will.
---
Gemstore Bonanza Intensifies!
---
Unlisted change: You can now upgrade your Enchanted Colorful Snowball with new colors. This was not possible after the novelties update, until now.
---
Here's a quick gif showing them off: https://gfycat.com/ScentedFrightenedAfricanjacana
---
Ignore the visual bugs, that's an artifact of using d912pxy
---
well anet where going  in semi maintenance mode with gw2 after PoF they just never told us about, they only put more focus into it after the layoffs (with not really great results lul)
---
I mean, you could always uninstall and stop bothering the rest of us with your incessant doom and gloom.
---
Bruh that new outfit looks terrible
---
If you have any still available I would appreciate one. Account: Sunwave.4039
---
Thanks for considering the gw2 community :)
---
Everything looks better than the medium armor but when it comes to the "jam as many auras on me as possible" crowd, swirling fire and ice bullshit is what they want
---
Wow that's some really bad logic.
---
[mini funko](https://i.imgur.com/NtN92ir.jpg)
---
Not bad given how karma is literally worthless unless you like getting carpal tunnel.
---
Anyway, the falling prices are quite nice.
---
Missing some as it cuts, but thanks.
---
Nope, not possible.
---
As far as i know skins that are unlocked cannot be removed from the account.
---
You're speaking the truth because your comment is already being auto-hidden by fanboy downvotes. :)
---
Yes you did guess correctly, sorry for late respond!
---
Thank you so much, take a look!
---
[That last mention of it I can find](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/938312#Comment_938312)...
---
&gt;Additionally, there is a new pvp/wvw armor set planned for late fall/early winter.
---
&gt;domesticated boneskinner
---
Please never speak again
---
Wow, that's really a lot. Have you counted them to see how many people you made happy? :) I don't need one, but thanks for being awesome!
---
It's about time. It always annoyed me to have full ascended except the breather. Now I can have the best of both!
---
With the given details, sounds like a no
---
Its okay, I still can type.
---
Yikes, thanks for sharing that!
---
thats how I see it... not the best conversion but OKish and fast
---
We don't know what 2020 has in store for us yet.
---
i always wonder,if those outfits designers are retarded,or they just like fire animation on your SHOULDERS.
---
Spirit shards are worth a lot if you figure out how to utilize them, so probably everything gold related.
---
Kill it with fire!
---
So, am I the only one crashing on startup then?
---
Also the boost caps at 2h and 15 minutes but if your current time +15 minutes goes above 2h 15minutes it won't add. The earliest you can add another 15 minutes is at the 2h mark exact.
---
How much is 5000 bags worth in karma
---
I'm not at the vender so idk
---
Sonic would like to talk to you
---
from other comments, it sounds like the paths are all about the same, but the "harder" one just has the snowflakes dissolve sooner so less time to jump?
---
I don't think I've _ever_ ran into another guildie when re-upping the buff. 24 hours of play is generally multi-day anyway, so nothing is lost. Only convenience gained.
---
No they are not.
---
Don't call it "generic town clothing crap" because the T-Shirt saved my male Sylvari Thief from suicide and is one of the best things to happen since launch because of how sick of medium armor I am. The Frostfire is indeed awful looking though.
---
&gt;maintenance mode in a year
---
New scheduled PVE content as well as a reinvestment in PvP and WvW balance and structure would hint otherwise, but ok, keep polluting the sub with your brainlet drivel.
---
Cool. Really like this change, hate it when it runs out and I'm in the middle of something so can't go back. Woop :D
---
Oh, so once again catering to people who play 30 minutes a day and taking from people who actually care to put time into the game?
---
&gt; For shame.  &lt;/s&gt;
---
Fixed it for you.
---
What do you win at level 80? How much gold do we even get from kills...ever? The reward track is nice...if you actually do pvp/wvw. But in wvw/pvp you don't get exp nor guild from killing.
---
Is this a troll post, or is this what you seriously believe?
---
Ofc, we all knew this. Honestly tho, I prefer the OPTION of buying a cape to having to pay a monthly subscription. 
---
That being said, I wish they would also give capes *and* mount skins as in game rewards as well.
---
No disrespect intended but why are you doing Anets advertising for them?
---
They want to do more and more in the Gem shop rather than in game, they should stump up their own publicity.
---
I would like a code.  Thanks.
---
Do you think this is Walmart?
---
We did. It's called the default one. One mount skin for one cape skin in-game. The only difference is the basic cape skin isn't given automatically like the default glider or mount skins (well, and it has more customisation than them - 2 dye channels instead of one plus the changing guild logo).
---
No, seriously. The 24h duration makes it so players return to guild hall every once in awhile. They see the hard work on decorations , sometimes other members.
---
Conceptually, it is an important design feature.
---
However, ANET hasn't really built on the guild foundation much since HoT. So this feature went under appreciated.
---
I do genuinely think the 24h duration is clever design that became outdated.
---
Well at least from now on we can match the backpack and its glider combo. Sucks it's not retroactive.
---
Yeah let's focus on random and weird bull shit that doesn't improve the game so we can ignore the game spiraling to its death.
---
Frostfire outfit and the new mounts come 24th?
---
Surrender in body and spirit.
---
So is this just a copy of the candy corn gobbler?
---
What do you win? I mainly do wvw and pvp. I get an armor piece every 7hrs of play that I can buy with 1g at VB, and 2 clovers, or 50 ls3/4 currency that I can gather in..20 min...please tell me what am I missing to make myself a winner.
---
I'd like one, thanks
---
Coincidentally, May 2020 is probably when the next episode is coming out
---
Data is data, be it about gem store dates or container drop rates, my goal for these posts are just to be informative. Them being helpful/harmful for Anet? Depends on how people act differently upon seeing the data. Do they buy more than they would have? Do they forego their daily/weekly gemstore checking because they know when what comes? And some items also have an impact on TP, which is nice to know beforehand if one would want to profit off of or be impacted by that, well, impact.
---
I literally just made a post about this so imma go ahead and delete that, but i 100% agree
---
You don't know how to look things up? How did you even find the button to create this post?
---
Probably some manager plays a weaver and forced the interns to make him an outfit and glider to match.
---
Maybe arcdps
---
They will fix that and PvP one I am sure
---
You need trade contracts as well though, which are not that easy to get as karma :)
---
Now that capes are dyeable? Expect a new one every patch...
---
The glider and cape are really pretty!
---
[Here's what Ben just said on twitch](https://imgur.com/a/SWeyxyA)
---
Yup. Predicted that on cape release day lol. Fire ones, flowy ones, different patterned ones etc
---
Gemstore content -&gt; expect hotfix in 1h and forced wvw server reset
---
Oh, finally.
---
I thought jumping was the fun part
---
It grants a unique buff, so it stacks with everything else. The candy corn cobbler which gives the regular booster buffs, so it doesn't stack.
---
People of Reddit, of course. You know, the same ones moaning about how easy and plentiful boons are and how it needs to be nerfed (er... "toned down") and made more scarce. This would be the perfect example of rare (and mostly useless due to the way it applied) boon production :)
---
Don't go wasting those whole 2 seconds of resistance all at once! 
---
/S
---
Now griffons have infusions. The cancer knows no boundaries.
---
Candy Corn Gobbler MK II coming to a gemstore near you next halloween !
---
What do you win?
---
It is insulting, especially when Bioluminescent weapons were released not so long ago and showed how these wooden weapons should be done. Smooth, HD textured, with every branch carefully modelled out. 
---
These rime verdant shits are so low poly, you can cut bread with those edges. And they are pathetic recolors of weapons which looked like shit even on release 7 years ago (with mistletoe slapped on). Unacceptable.
---
You equip an underwater weapon spear, trident or harpune gun.
---
If you still have a free one, I'd like one! DM me please!
---
I go into the guild hall every single time I'm online to -
---
1. gather from nodes
---
2. See what's on offer for commendations
---
Your comment is not entirely correct.
---
The one thing is, the easy route is used a lot more in general, which means chances are the timer is already ongoing when you jump in.
---
G E M S T O R E  C O N T E N T
---
That would make sense. I tend to do the middle lane for that reason, usually seems least populated.
---
Needs commendations which are guild missions doesn’t it? Idk didn’t get the guild cape but assumed so.
---
May is a month you silly goose!
---
How did you get it?
---
Actually, I'm a really big fan of the Lithosol skimmer skin. It'll go great with my elementalist!
---
It's under "News" rather than guides, but I'll see if we can get it to share the two namespaces. Thanks!
---
does it copy your poly-infusion color?
---
axolotl skyscale, so cute
---
Wow, you must be fun at parties
---
Mhhh. "shrug"
---
This happens when too many players get too much rewards too easily, so rewards must be spread to other activities, to make players play other activities, not just the puzzle 24/7.
---
oh, finally a dagger skin I like
---
Broke: Changing it on internal servers, not shipping to live
---
Woke: Changing on internal servers and live servers
---
Coke: Not changing it on internal servers, only changing it on live
---
For stomping Necros :^)
---
they were always broken I think, people just realized they were broken so started to exploit them, you could spam infinite banners and they would never despawn. Quick fix was to disable them entirely.
---
Getting the Caladbog skin was great in-game content.  Getting an item bought with currency that's been in the game since launch, and doesn't require any unique activity to earn doesn't even compare.
---
chatcodes
---
Ah ok. Well I appreciate this. Will you be doing more like this going forward? I.e. be the new dulfy?
---
&gt;Cause soldiers is pretty bad.
---
*Sad soldiers reaper noises*
---
Oh, upcoming stuff.
---
So, what does that new Starlight Wings Backpack/Glider look like?
---
So I can rep a larger guild then go back to my little private one and have the buffs?
---
Yeah, with the way they look and the box text I'm willing to bet that this is supposed to replace the black / gold Lion skins and the immortal ones before that. But maybe not, who knows.
---
What chest/arm skins is the gliding guy wearing?
---
All the mounts started with 1, the capes started with 1. seems legit.
---
This is a nice update to buffs 👍
---
Oh damn
---
No, nothing new this time
---
That currency hasn't been in since launch
---
We're perpetually stuck in the fight. As soon as everyone wipes it starts again
---
Literally.

It is also random or does it always give the same buff?

Try going in the PVP lobby and using the LA portal, or WvW.

A wintersday gift is more useful than a useless transformation

If you didn't use it, maybe - but if you did, that's a nope dawg.
---
I didn't say you were butthurt. You're for some reason butthurt for me correcting the minor fact about currency implementation dates. Chill out my dude.
---
With T-Shirt? I like Elonian/Spearmarshal's Pants with it most since it's closest thing to shorts if you wear Marauder or Duelest Boots with it, which are the only normal shoes that aren't long-boots. Invisible shoes would be nice if they weren't so rude about it being impossibly rare.
---
"We are happy to announce Guild Wars 3 is going to be an Epic store exclusive battle-royale title."
---
Well, we can no doubt expect at least 5 more episodes (I suspect 7 more for S5), with at least one map per two episodes, and if they maintain the bi-monthly release cadence they want, that'll take up releases up to and including September. And following S5 that will probably be an expansion just to satate the "game can't survive without expansion" naysayers like Delvien.
---
We can also expect a return of the festivals we've gotten so far - LNY, SAB, DB, FotFW, Halloween, Wintersday.
---
So we do have *some* idea of what's in store for the future.
---
Asura - Now available in bubble gum flavour.
---
I know that I'm just dreaming here, but I wish they could update Guild Wars 2 graphics to Unreal 4.
---
Just avoid the yellow ones, and you'll be fine! ;-)
---
where you get the gobbler?
---
I would love to suck myself some special snowflakes...
---
Really? I don't see it in the changelog.
---
The reason GW3 is not going to happen is because people would not move from GW2.
---
So it would have to be basically an expansion that carries over all progres, and only being called a different title because it'll use a different engine, like Overwatch 2.
---
But why making a GW3 in the first place if it's going to carry over everything? To do things that can't be done in GW2, hence a seamless world and currently impossible features like hats with hair.
---
Thanks!  
---
I want that Lithosol for my elementalist. It looks so cool!
---
No it's not. Check the usernames. I think you think you're replying to someone else entirely. The first thing I said was the currency correction mate.
---
Not the Supreme Runes of holding. Those are only from Ecto gambling. The ones on the TP, someone had to ecto gamble to get them.
---
to be honest, i like them, but only because i really liked sylvari weapons at the beginning, even if i always were salty because every other race had 3 set, but asura and sylvari had to share t2.
---
also, t3 are so nichè that they could just do this stuff to them and everyone would think they were new.

---
People would not move from GW2? Lol?
---
For a Holiday themed Sylvari. It's fine if folks don't like them, that means they'll be cheap on the TP and I can get them all.
---
Might as well nerf the other two routes while you’re at it, Anet.
---
Better than saying random shit.
---
It's hilarious that you argued with me and thought I was someone else and still have a hard time admitting that. Oof. Have a great day man.
---
Of course they are, it's a new cash cow.
---
Code on master, test in production !
---
I highly doubt that. It'd be far easier for them to update their engine than to try and rework GW2 to use Unreal Engine 4.... and updating the GW2 engine is probably not an easy, simple, or quick thing to do.
---
yeah anet fucked up here, well what you gonna do - when was the last dungeon they made anyway
---
You *can't* buy them, that's the thing with those rng "rewards".
---
MMORPG sequels rarely work.   
---
The only ones you can still hear about, Lineage II and Everquest II, are the extreme of success, and they were not that successful as sequels.  
---
The only reason people moved from GW1 to GW2 so easily is because GW1 had so little unlocks to lose. Just a few outfits, character slots, and that's mostly it.
---
Unless people could carry over all their thousands of dollars in progress to a GW3, those who invested the most time and money in GW2 would stay in GW2. Which means the biggest expenders would not move to GW3, and it would have to get new players or underperform compared to GW2.
---
I understand this reasoning, and I would also advocate for a gw2 remake considering that a lot of people seem to have problems with gw2's performance / single-core reliance and there is always such a huge amount of talk about spaghetti code, 
---
But then again. GW3 can be anything they want to be. It can be vastly different and attract a different kind of playerbase. It even could be a singleplayer experience set in the far future of GW2, which is only sad in the way that it kinda kills the feeling of us, the Commanders, mattering in deciding Tyria's fate/possibly failing to save it. (Not that it isn't kinda clear we will succeed, but there is still an exciting inkling of uncertainty/things being up in the air). 
---
I doubt that it is likely. I can only see GW3 as another epic multiplayer experience, too. But I wouldn't argue that they need the GW2 playerbase's loyalty. They just need to make a dang good game. 
---
That said, the U4 project is probably something completely different. I just hope it is a success, because I still strongly believe they are milking GW2 players for their other projects, and it would be nice to see one of them going somewhere.
---
squack
---
This has been the case for all festivals since Dragon Bash.
---
Dragon Bash: Recolor of precursor into holographic variants
---
Halloween: Ascalonian Catacomb weapon but with fire
---
Wintersday...
---
On the flipside, they gave us some really nice armor pieces for the meta rewards instead of a mini (new commander wings, Pumpkin helm, sweater)...
---
25% more point does not mean 25% faster rewards, let alone the reward is...not that great.  
---
I normally run with 10% from guild, 50% from booster, 10% from birthday, 5% from reward track, so the 25% bumps the normal of 1.75 to 2, meaning that the time I saved to get to reward is actual (1/1.75) - (1/2) = 7% extra time saved. This does not account for the non-multiplicative potions I get from daily (10% of overall track per day) and from pip (various amount). This means it's actually closer to (0.9/1.75) - (0.9/2) = 6.4% extra time saved....for the reward track that gives like...10g worth of clovers and...let's say 10g worth of junk. Not sure what you are aiming for from these reward track aside from gift of battle, but I would advice you spend the 4hrs of reward track time on fractals/gathering/world boss that can easily net you 20g within 1 hr of play instead. Still don't know what you win with this thing after losing 140g. If you main wvw like me, you get those armor chests, tome of experience, currencies, flowing like no tomorrow anyway. All I want from wvw is tickets....which cannot be obtained from reward track sadly.
---
What are the changes they'll get grandfathered in for people who bought the packs :p
---
(I know its not happening lol)
---
Guild Wars 2 is a sequel and is a success if u ask me.
---
Well their reasoning at the start of the game is that the majority of people would not spend a cent - apart from buying the game itself - but they would still make the game populated enough for the other to rationalize spending money to show off. If it is still their plan then ones like you are actually a part of it.
---
Of course by then they boasted about their bi-weekly cadence which was to ensure that players would log on the game. This part is long lost.
---
DM if you still have one :) New player!
---
I'd actually prefer it not reworked. I'm happy with what I paid for. Please do not change things I've paid for.
---
Does the XP boost work on WXP?
---
That moment when Black Desert, Osu and even ATLAS far eclipse a game that used to be one of the top MMOs in the market and THE B2P MMO to get.
---
EPIC SEVEN, a MOBILE GAME \[and one with its own fair deal of controversy lately\] had more people watching it \[you know, a game you can literally download on your phone for free right now\] than Guild Wars 2.
---
That's hilarious.
---
I wish they made an infusion instead. Now I can't have the aura with the bubble skin :(
---
No, just gives 50% bonus reward track in WvW/PvP and regular XP boost in PvE.
---
Kinda like that shield
---
anet designers really feeling nostalgic for that 1999 look
---
just imagine....Mike Z surprises everyone and announces a new engine for the game out of the blue and we all ride the hype train!!!(...and then I woke up)
---
GW1 was not an MMORPG. They had to come up with a genre for it and all, CCORPG. And as I said, it that very few unlocks.
---
GW1 was not like other MMORPGs with lots of items to own and lots of progress and tons of grinding and levels. Filling a HoM to 50 points can be quite fast.  
---
When new content stopped being added, there was not much things to do. And the HoM made players feel like their progress carried over at least in some way.  
---
GW2 may not have the tons of grinding for levels, but it has tons of progress to be lost, and tons of progress to do for every individual. Some players will take years to get it all done. So many players won't move unless they see they are not losing progress, and this time a HoM would not cut it.
---
You just put the gifts in the bank and sell them a couple months later.
---
[sure](https://i.imgur.com/DQUi0MM.jpg)
---
More than any previous set of this category, these could have been amazing raid/PvP rewards. 
---
Maybe in another dimension.
---
Good. Now give us the version without the glow please.
---
Yeah tbh I'd love this. I have exo suit and Halloween mount pacts that excluded the new Bois :( it'd be the best Christmas present if Anet went back to include it
---
Is this a reference? To what?
---
I have no eyes but I must see.
---
As someone who farms the hard route every year, I'm glad they changed it. 15 gifts was a lot for 2 minutes of effort, and it definitely made farming gifts easy, but it was so much excess compared to the rest of the whole festival that I didn't think anything else was worth my time. You're conveniently leaving out that most other activities got buffed on their gift drops, and THAT'S why it got nerfed.
---
I just want it to take the candy corn from my bank inventory instead of having to keep it in my bags.
---
They are...
---
You raid/PvP to get gold, then use that gold to buy these weapons off the TP, that were put there from other players who raid/PvP'd to get gold to buy gems to buy keys to open BL chests.
---
By the way they run this game, then yes.
---
I'm confused. I've been able to change colors from the novelty tonic.
---
&gt; huge injection of funds into the game
---
Money is NOT the problem, it has NEVER been the problem. Horrid management is.
---
I would not. I pay -whenever I pay- for a feature that is already developed, not for a hypothetical future. If I buy, say, a skin, it is because it happens to be available now. If all I ever get for that money is that skin for the duration of my presence ingame then it is all right and what I paid for. I mean, I am paying them because they *already* made something I want to buy. So I don't care what that money will be used toward.
---
Spending money to further future game development has proven to be akin to gambling -especially with the increase of crowdfunding. I tend to stay away from it.
---
Probably a trailer or something.
---
jumping puzzle
---
Absolutely *brutal*
---
They already said existing backs aren't getting updated. Cough up some cash, apparently.
---
I only hate the 5s CD.
---
????
---
Not even legendary backpacks?
---
The fuck?
---
That happens all the time. You made a change and it just doesn't change the behaviour of your code even though you're sure it would! So you try to find the mistake in your code and try a few different changes that don't end up affecting the behaviour either. After like an hour you'll find out it's because you forgot to hit "compile", or you worked on a different version than the one you were executing, or in the case of websites your browser still had the old version cached.
---
It could also mean that there's some difference in their internal builds and the production builds that genuinely make the guild buffs behave differently but that's scary and I don't want to think about it.
---
We had wrapped legendaries before.
---
Thank you for confirming!

These are not a regular BL set though and will not land on the TP. 
---
Besides, gold grind for gemstore stuff still isn't a decent reward stru... 
---
- nvm, I'll just assume you're joking.
---
all should be same, it was said here, and all should be 15.
---
Is that a Panda Springer?!? Rip my wallet...
---
mmm i'm trying but it's not like yours ... nose is weird too. suppose i need to work on it. really cool anyway. a totally new look. excellent. ty
---
Follow the white rabbit my friend.
---
Also Guild wars 2 came out 5 years after the last content drop for guild wars 1. So by then most of the people were willing to move on.
---
Hang on, you can get 24hr buffs in the guild hall?
---
Willfull ignorance has helped no-one.
---
Overhauling old code can be a *lot* more work than writing new code from scratch.
---
Yeah. More time to have all your 'affairs' in order with the game, and less progress to lose, and the HoM to grap it with a neat bow, and more people considered themselves 'done' with the game.
---
No way as many people will be at that stage in GW2, when I'm still helping players get S2 and S3 achievements.
---
Thanks for posting. 🤩
---
It's about the feeling that someone gives you gifts not the gold.
---
think its more like 50/50 boost or gift, but anyway waste of snowflakes after boost is capped
---
&gt; visual issues like that are low priority
---
Basically, you just outlined Anet's poor developing practices, and you did it with a run-on sentence as well. Kudos to you. Why fix something that is in the game, when they can just sell new skins in the gem-store. Integrity is not here.
---
[are u sure?](https://youtu.be/1OFI32oC7Yw)
---
You can though! They'll be in the black lion statuette shop 1-2 chests down the line for 60 statuettes. You're guaranteed to get 1 statuette per key. A key is $1.56 individually. If you don't buy keys in bulk and have the worst possible luck, a black lion exclusive costs just $93.60. If that bums you out, you can just grind the approximately 3,200 gold needed for the 7500 gems. Of course, buying keys in bulk is a significant savings! By Ogden's hammer!
---
Oh yeah! Time for me to try mesmer again and drop it off after 3 days because I suck with mesmer!
---
Yeah these are kind of a weird hybrid between reskin and new meshes...
---
Where did this data come from?
---
lmao "Some technical problem"  ...  
---
The interns are running the ship.
---
Why do I need to be reminded of this?
---
Yea ok, but what about the gold?
---
What kinda printer uses red toner.
---
Would you also prefer they never add living world content?
---
https://youtu.be/NE7Q2et5aI0?t=145
---
is it better to take the gold or gamble, take a wild guess
---
mistlock worked for me ... have not tried to go further yet...
---
I  wouldn't complain about losing map/zones in a gw3.  It would give a reason to play the new versions.
---
Something like letting a hundred years or so pass and you inherit (gear, inventory, titles, etc..) from your gw2 characters.
---
hardcore and yet *cries*
---
He hasn't paid for living world, so no ^^^/s
---
What traits would you recommend for a minion master build?
---
I appreciate these posts because there are a couple of skins I keep waiting for but I always forget to keep an eye on the store and end up missing them, so these give me a heads up.
---
I love this answer so much xD
---
What are you talking about? I'm just saying I prefer the current candy corn gobbler and I want the product I paid for. It gives me free exp boosters. I don't want that nerfed.
---
hehe just dont give up that fast, its all a matter of longer training. im sure you will be good if you dont stop playing it after 3 days ;)
---
yeah, these all seem to be simple texture or particle swaps. Probably one person creating new rewards. Better than nothing though?
---
Oh wait, these are BL exclusive skins?  Ofc they are lol.  No matter how salty and cynical I can be, ANET always finds a way to disappoint me lol.
---
Something an Asura would invent, in an attempt to print objects in 4 dimensions most likely.
---
Again, what are you talking about?
---
OP is suggesting they should NERF gobbler from providing free/infinite boosters to something that gives a measly 25% kill exp and pvp/wvw reward track. 
---
Right now it provides me with free item booster that can grant 33% more harvest,  free magic find, 50% exp booster (FROM ALL SOURCES, NOT JUST KILL!), free kill booster, 50% reward track bonus
---
I'm trying to save the item from being nerfed here.
---
The red Ascalonian weapons and the wrapped precursors we got for Wintersday a couple of years ago at least look nice.
---
So 8? That's a lot.
---
OP is saying you get to chose your buff, instead of having it randomized.
---
sell, so you can make gold off other people's will to gamble.
---
Not being in software development, what you describe does make sense to me....but for it to go LIVE in a GaaS title?  Nah.  No legit excuse for that imo.
---
As I said, a great change, but it also underlines troubling issues with this title.
---
I was more talking about the effort poured into the weapon set. As for their aesthetics, this is entirely subjective. Even the Rimer Verdant sets have a little... *something* (like the Rose focus and torch)... But it's very niche.
---
Graphic Upgrade Bundle - 500 gems per character. 
---
A great deal, since who cares about inferior graphics and FPS for a bank toon, right?
---
Haha they smart
---
They reworked bolt meteorlogious long time ago
---
Why cant they do it on backpacks?
---
Inb4 it does have a 24h duration, but just doesn't show it anymore.
---
haven't had any major outrage in days now, people try harder
---
*Apples, apples for sale, come and get a nice quiet apple!* Psst! Over here Initiate.
---
Starting your journey to take down the Elder Dragons, huh? But due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;questioning session&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). We have plenty of experienced historians there that can guide you on your first steps.
---
If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
It actually does just that tho.
---
Lmao that's a god damn invisible raptor.
---
because an ingame item that is a reward for grinding fractals day in and out that has been out for nearly 2years, they havent bothered to fix it. You like don't see anything wrong with devs not bothering to fix something players have been complaining out since the day it's released and instead just keep releasing new items (and only fix them if they're gemstore)?
---
Yay, they made the rime-rimmed breather a skin!..... Weeks after I deleted it from a character because it was soulbound and I was going to not use that character anymore.
---
Hi. I don't need one, just want to point out that the other side of each card has a -10€ PoF voucher. Don't throw those away once you're done giving all the minipet&amp;stuff codes.
---
You're late. This is the second gem store cape.
---
It probably wouldn't be as profitable. There is a reason why item malls and loot boxes are so popular in the industry.
---
Literally all F2P models are based around taking enough money from the fraction of the playerbase that actually spends money.
---
Any info on how to get this? Those weapons look incredible.
---
If you can't jump, bell choir.
---
But this is just dripping with potential! 
---
e.g. hard-mode versions of existing maps for that o.g. GW1 vanquishing feel  or PvP enabled zones with Factions. Sorry I know this is way out of scope.
---
People should not feel excluded locked out of rewards from hardcore content.
---
Pretty sure it makes more sense to buy the skins on the trading post than to spend 125 statuettes. They are in 35-200g right now.
---
And on top of that stupid comments.
---
You'd be surprised how often that happens in all kinds of software
---
Somehow GW2 getting a new U4 graphics engine is more believable than us ever seeing the WvW Alliance system.
---
&gt;fix something players have been complaining out
---
So... Everything?
---
Real talk, I forgot about this and went left because I wanted to just do some casual easy runs since it's been a year since I did this. I didn't fall because of the snowflakes once. Halfway through the second run, I realized this was the hardest one, the one that I'd struggled and cursed over a couple years ago. Spamming it last year must have gotten me some rote memorization down!
---
can i have one also thanks
---
This route being nerfed is whatever, my issue is Halloween being ignored with its rewards while Wintersday get this adjustment. Why the bias, Anet? Halloween its literally lab or die. No reason to do any other event. But with Wintersday you actually adjust rewards accordingly. I know you guys are a giant mess but come on. At least try to balance rewards for all festivals. You guys are becoming even more of a joke.
---
Also in case you missed it, the guild missions are the content, not talking to vendor. Are you that dense? Its a new thing added to give value to something that genuinely needs it since there's not much reason to bother with guild missions anymore.
---
Fuck, why couldn't these be boreal weapons. Or better yet, additional gameplay rewards.
---
Um i just left the squad and was ported out.
---
You should also get aquabreather when you level up. You can go without one but then you have no stats on them so eventually you would want one with some stats on.
---
For me no squad even exists. It says I'm locked into the squad then never makes a squad
---
Guild teleport.
---
Next patch -&gt; "WB now have the same loot as Raid bosses!". 
---
casual - a person who does something irregularly
---
GW2 casual meaning - retard who can't do anything except spamming 11111111111111111, obviously can't even jump
---
I was so happy when i saw this. I always forget to add the buff for WvW and notice it when i am in WvW and usually have a queue and have to run without out. Please please make it stay, or add a buff guy in WvW and PvP.
---
That’s...surprisingly well done
---
Just checking through an alt account, the double Binding of Ipos and Binding of Ipos book while holding Exordium is viewable from other accounts.
---
There is no production, only test environment in actual load.
---
This is such a QoL improvement :) Finally one less buff expiration to keep track of.
---
They never fixed dye channels for legendary armor, there's a pretty good chance they won't go back and give older backpieces, legendary or not the ability to be dyed.
---
Woops missed the link! Sorry.
---
Also damn that is a problem if it effects what others see.
---
The backpack is dyeable !
---
Yes, arcdps - metrics menu.

How hard is the achievements? Im using a really old laptop that gets 5 fps in lion's arc lowest setting. If there is competition like winning a race or raid then i wont be able to get it this year.
---
I appreciate the work. Thank you! Honestly I love the game, if I have your skill I would do it for them too.
---
They will not do that because they can't take the skin from you and if you give them that reason more reason to don't give you the refund. Just because you like a new skin more does not give you the right to refund the old skin, if anyone would do this every time there is a new mount skin they find better then what the bought before, anet would not make money.
---
It's the usual annual achievements thing where there are about 7 achievements you have to do for the thing. Race, jp, infinerarium, etc. It's pretty simple; I play gw2 on a toaster and I can do it.
---
Congrats, I wish more people had this mentality, contrary to popular belief most raids are easy (hell, Vg and Horse aren't even the easiest). It took me years to get into raising cause I got sold this ideia that they were super hard, when I got into them, round them super easy and enjoyable, bought a commander tag and started to organise my runs from there.
---
As a follow up, look into wing4, the first 3 bosses are pretty easy, the 4th (Deimos) can be a bit trickier for new players, but can also be cheesed easily with a ranged strategy where all the pressure is focused on 3 party members and the rest of the party can be nearly afk.
---
Vale guardian is a great raid to learn, keep running it, it has nice mechanics that aren't too elaborate but compliment each other well, and you'll notice similar mechanics to some extent on other bosses.
---
Good job mate.
---
You should be surprised at how common this is in EVERY IT services, hospital included. Enjoy =)
---
This game is just gem store updates.
---
They are literally not excluded since the other paths grant gifts as well. 
---
Any content that comes out of those gifts, and the means to acquire them, is thus accessible for those who do the other paths.
---
Even after 7 wings VG is still one of the hardest bosses. Gz.
---
In that alternate universe the game died cause there was no funding for any xpac. Bank tabs and character slots are not profitable enough.
---
Don't get me wrong, I agree that we should get more ingame rewards, even if recolors or reshades of existing itensbz
---
