This has nothing to do with build templates. It would be less convenient having to switch to a build template that had anti-fall-damage than it would be to just manually change that one trait.

Sorry, I misread your message..

Yeah I don't think it was confirmed.

Sounds like it's you xp bar maybe... Are you in the right maps to train the mastery? Red is core, purple is pof and green is hot
---
12,000 hours would actually be more than a solid year of their life.
---
Ohhhh...
---
I'm not sure where your analogy is going. Is Holosmith the Lambo or the Fiat?
---
Question thread??   Link me please.
---
"immature kids" is certainly one way to handwave a warning from people who've been around a while and are getting tired of the same repeating cycle
---
&gt;only one guild
---
Which one? LN, CnD, FF, SC?
---
They'll leave before day one then.
---
People behaving badly, agitated or downright mean when things aren't going smoothly is not really specific to GW2, though
---
So it is..  hahaha thank you!!
---
We looked at the positive stuff. We went through it. We appreciated it. Now what's left is the aberrent decisions Anet made in the last two years.
---
 Trahearne  was handled a lot better, it can come off like he was a mary sue to some, due to all the knowledge he had, the vast number of people he knows, but sylvari are special and as firstborn he is 25 years old, and it's most likely he spent all those years exploring the world, building contacts, exploring Orr, etc...   
---
This is really only the "issue" that crops up once you want to level more characters from different races, orders and other kind of choices and realize just how big his net of acquaintances is.   
---
PC leading the pact at the time wasn't possible, being a member of one of 3 orders, and Trehearne was a neutral party, Gw2 never had a super hero vibe to it, it was always groups of people rising together against near impossible odds, even our PC, while powerful had a clearly defined limits.   
---
Another good point in Trahearne favor is how he was often seen doubting himself and asking for your and others council, and while he was leading the Pact, he was always more of a friend and companion to PC.
---
The one thing I picked up from friends and guildies ingame is that during these weeks where this subreddit was nothing but a hate circlejerk about build templates was that instead of voicing their own opinions about it they much rather avoided reddit like the plague instead to just wait for this all to blow over. So no, that does not sound like it resembles the community at all to me.
---
It's not harsh; it's honest.  Most of the skins are in the gem store or loot boxes.
---
These tin foil hat theories are getting more ridiculous by the minute
---
Yep, that's the key for sure.  I used to be in a progression raiding guild in Rift and played the game from day 1(actually from beta weekends since I pre-ordered).  I loved the game, but it was like a second job for almost 3 years.  I was literally playing 40+ hours per week while working 50+ hours per week.  
---
I had 4 progression raid nights(4 hours per scheduled), and two raid nights to run old content to help gear up non-raid guild members and alts.  That was on top of doing my dailies and expert dungeons on my main as well as at least two to three alts to keep all of my toons raid ready.
---
I pre-ordered GW2 and liked the idea of it, but when it came out I was too entrenched in Rift and I just couldn't get out of the mindset that I was in for hardcore raiding.  I basically played GW2 for less than 10 hours and just shelved it.
---
In the Summer of 2013 I decided to move back to the area I grew up in, and buy a house.  I stopped playing Rift at that time.  Not playing an MMO left a gap in my gaming and I kind of missed it.  I started logging into GW2 again just to scratch the itch.  At first it was still kind of unfulfilling, but as I changed my mindset I began enjoying it more and more.  I actually found it relaxing to just run around exploring and doing map completion.  I also got into sPvP which was fun.
---
I now play GW2 a lot more than I used to, but the best part is I don't feel like I have to.  I've 100% map completion pre-expansions, crafted Sunrise, Twilight(and then obviously Eternity) on my main.  I have a level 80 of all classes without using any level skipping boosts.  I have all of the mounts except the WvW cat(I haven't played WvW since I could stop after the required amount for the two legendaries as I burnt myself out on it).
---
I've barely played HoT or living world season 3, but have completed almost all map completion for PoF and LWS4.  I've only done a few dungeons in story mode, and have yet to do a fractal.  I've never done the raids.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is, the best part of GW2 is that there is a ton of stuff to do, but also it's not like you feel like you have to do any of it.  Some weeks or even months I just log in daily and hit up my home instance for the gathering mats and see what the daily quests are.  If the dailies look like fun or at least not anything I don't feel like doing I may do them, or I might not and just log back out.  
---
Right now I'm just excited for the new LW season, and contemplating if I should finally start playing season 3 again in-between so I can finally experience more HoT content.  I've also thought about doing map completion on one of my alts, or looking into what it takes to craft legendaries from HoT or PoF?  
---
Either way I don't feel like I have to do any of it, which if a great feeling!
---
If you're only forcing yourself through those hours for a pay off at the end then you are a fool. There is no pay off at the end of an MMORPG. It's just a hamster wheel. You either enjoy it while you are doing it or you don't because the only true end is when they shut it down.
---
Which is exactly why this place has nosedived.
---
Because they implemented the build template system, but monetized it too heavily for many. Especially since all people had it for free with a mod, which isn't supported anymore.  
---
Plus the builder is kinda limiting since for now you can have 6 builds at most, even by paying, and some people have like 10 or so (generally the wvwers).  
---
So...yeah. The community is kinda split right now. Many are in uprise, while many others are fine...personally I'm kinda inbetween. For example I think that the build templates themselves are fine, but the pages cost too much, especially when there's little to no gain with them compared to when we used arcdps, and there's too little of them. For the rest the system is kinda fine. The system could have been handled better let's say...  
---
At the same time the game have to monetize, up until now there was nothing really needed in the gemstore...and there's still gem conversion anyway. With the Icebrood Saga they will also give another 2-ish year of contents for free again...so it's normal that they get a bit more "aggressive"...also people is a bit sore after the Saga announcement, since they wanted an xpac and they didn't reveal any tasty "xpac level feature" coming yet...so some people is quite disheartened by the Saga.
---
Probably. But the meta must go on.
---
Oh well, one born every minute.
---

Holosmith is fine, just know how to play it well enough to get close to the bench, and know the mechanics of the encounters. That'll be the real decider as to whether you're useless playing holo. I wouldn't kick someone for joining as holo (except maybe on Largos lol, really hate wasting time on that fight if I can't see what's happening on one of the platforms, would rather just play it safe and go all Mirage. But at that point I would have specifically requested that in the LFG), but maybe would raise eyebrows if you were joining as a power holo on matthias/desmina or something like that. I tend to give everyone their chance, personally I'm not very confrontational and I expect most raiders are the same. But you should be prepared that as an "inferior class" you'll have more attention on you throughout a raid. You'll probably meet more people who will be happy to kick you after a bad mistake or lower-than-average DPS, where another class might have gotten away with it. But they certainly aren't "useless".
---
However I would echo what other people have said and repeat that "maining" a single class, doing a single role, for raids would be a bad idea. At least try out other DPS specs on the golem, and make it a mix of Power (DH, Power Chrono, Daredevil), Condi (Mirage, Revenant, Firebrand) to get a feel for some of the commonly seen meta picks with high benchmarks
---
I play it more than 3 hours so i guess it depends who you ask
---
For PoF, there are a few work around methods. If you have the Lily of the Elon, your guild hall is there, you have a teleport to friend, or if you have the spearmarshal's plea (requires you to have finished PoF once and started working on the griffon), then you can use any of those to teleport into the desert. Otherwise, yes, you have to complete the story mission
---
For season 4, you can buy an item on each map which is account bound, and using it instantly teleports you to that respective map on whatever character you're on
---
&gt; have yet to do a fractal. 
---
I’m biased but IMO fractal is the best content in the game, especially for CMs. The instabilities can be annoying but they keep things fresh, pugging also keeps things fresh. I enjoy playing with different people everyday and enjoy seeing how different classes/builds work. 
---
I used to be casual and was terrible at the game, it was fractals that made me great at it, despite my high ping. This acquired skill in turn made me able to solo stuff in open world as well as in episodes of new stories. 
---
Anyway I highly recommend trying out fractals. Tier1 and Tier4 are the most fun. Tier 1 is easy as you get to be familiar with mechanics, Tier 4 is when people start to min max for optimised runs. Just yesterday there was an amazing Scrapper in my pug. He supported so well despite being dps it felt like I was being coddled by a WvW Scrapper. He was also putting out respectable damage, contesting my berserker for top dps. It was fun. 
---
Plus, the money is good ;)
---
Yeah serve it up :D
---
I think the people who are miserable need to move on.  The game that isn't going the direction they want it to is consuming them.
---
At the same time, its hard to blame people who are frustrated because Anet refuses to listen to them.  I also can't blame those who get sick of the same posts over and over.  "Level 80, now what?", "Here's my cosplay!", "First legendary!" etc.  It gets old and when there is no new content to talk about, it only gets worse and worse before it eventually dies off.  With that said though, I don't think people need to go in those threads and be rude about it.  Just ignore them and move onto another thread or subreddit.
---
As for the downright toxic people, I think as a sub we do a pretty good job downvoting them so nobody has to see their hateful and/or trolling comments.  Mods have also done a good job of banning such people it seems.
---
I've been playing MMOs since the original. I'm not talking about World of Warcraft. I'm talking about Ultima Online. I've been playing MMOs since 56k dial up modems were "high speed internet". I've seen them come and I have seen them go. I enjoyed them while I liked them and then moved on when I didn't. It's all about perception. If you look at it as some sort of pay off at the end, and I don't just mean levels and gear, then you will be disappointed every single time. It's really that simple. It's just a game. It's not a college degree. It's really not that important. Certainly not important enough to piss all over some new player's parade because you're some bitter cunt who can't move on and is envious of somebody else's happiness.
---
On demand crafting? Its the same .. currency for raids / pvp, gold / materials for crafting. Both ways require you to play the game. At least in pvp / raids / fractals you're building ascended gear while also gaining some gold.
---
&gt;And most of the sub defends this
---
This too. I've never seen a sub with so many people defending anti player practices. It took bungie less than a year to clean up their act with Destiny 2 and improve on communication with the community and Forsaken's release. Anet behaves like Bungie did in Destiny 2's launch, only that's their default state from since the release of the game from what I've seen, and even worse with their stance on "exploits". Destiny has had multiple loot exploits, from just shooting into a cave to completing a raid and no one has ever been banned for them. Imagine banning players for using values your devs fucked up to generate gold.
---
You're right dude! They are almost the same! Except they have completely different numbers, do completely different bursts, have wildly different dps. But if you take all that into account, sure they are basically the same.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDnK-Im9Hg8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDnK-Im9Hg8)
---
Yeah, I'm genuinely dumbfounded. I remember the last ERP threads, people were ***happy*** some content creators were stopping making GW2 content. And that's ignoring how Anet decided to not support the event on the technicality of the camera plugin, something they could have incorporated to their software stack and regulated it's use for big events like that one. It's not unheard of companies incorporating 3rd party devs, just look at Riot hiring Boompje and using his "indie" Mac OSX league of legends client. I believe the guy still works there, he was hired some 4 years ago. And this is a "mod" that could have ***easily*** been used to steal player credentials, but Riot decided to let Boompje support it until they hired him to release the official OS X client.
---
And this is pure bs and infact a lie. 
---
I checked earlier today when someone else tried to claim the same shit. Infact there are about 500 gem store skins (armor, weapons and backapacks), infact it is a little bit less but say 500. Alltogether there are over 5800 skins in this game (armor, weapons and backpacks) which means 5300 skins are not gem store skins.
---
&gt;i get really demotivated when i know that i play a very inferior class
---
if you stopped playing inferior class irl it wouldn't.
---
No way to guess, they were added too recently to find a pattern.
---
Amazing that they downvote you for giving the right information about why this videos are comming up now. 
---
This reddit get worse by the day.

🤷‍♂️ Curb_your_enthusiasm.gif

Appreciate you though +1

Haha point proven, thank you r/Guildwars2, you beautiful bastards. &lt;3
---
I don't like parties. 
---
I don't see how not encouraging adults as if they were 4 is connected to not being fun.
---
We already have seats in the gem store. Tables seems like the next step.
---
Coming back to the game after a 3 years break. Wanna get best-in-slot armor pieces, so Ascended essentially. How do I go about this ? There seem to multiple options, and I am just so overwhelmed. Could someone please provide some guidance here ? Thank you!
---
I mean TBF it's kind of an easy mistake to make as the title of the video doesn't really give a good idea of what we're looking at at a glance. Combined with the fact that people know that DH has been out for a long time now it's easy to assume they'd just think it was some sort of long lost promotion about a class that was released years ago.
---
It's always worth getting your old account back as your character(s) have Birthday gifts waiting &amp; you likely have a ton of mystic coins from before the change
---
But lack of utility and support is holos biggest problem. Its a very selfish spec that doesnt bring anything to the group without a major dps hit and the dps is just mediocre to begin with.
---
The cc is not very strong. Its even quite low if you dont sacrifice multiple k dps for extra cc utilities. Holo lacks burst for fractals aswell. Its ok'ish in casual pugs with dedicated full supports but as soon as you try to remove full supports engi just doesnt fit into a comp anymore.
---
If u r in hurry then u don’t have to
---
U send email u wait idk how long until they answer then it takes a few more days to provide proof back and forth ( 1 reply per day )
---
If u r not then it’s ok
---
What if Blessed Online 2 is being released and Anet is worried about losing customers to that MMO so they are making up fake stories to post on Reddit about how good GW2 is?
---
Are you saying Quiznos is really good?
---
It also hurts the studio as a whole. Their only live game/product isn't seeing growth. There's no expansion sales spike on the horizon to pad their numbers for a quarter or two. Their last few attempts to get a new product off the ground were torpedoed. And at the end of it all, they're beholden to a publicly-traded publisher. So, good luck to them?
---
I peruse this sub once in a while, maybe post a reply to something. Generally have a mediocre opinion that gets dickhammered south while someone smarts off and starts tossing insults around. It's good fun. Especially since it's certainly not my blood pressure that's suffering at the end of the day c:
---
Compared to this game, I feel bad for anyone making new characters in ESO.
---
&gt; why is Anet under fire right now
---
Just sit back, grab some ~~popcorn~~ Quiznos and enjoy the show.  Anet has figured out that the only way to make GW2 relevant is to make the players mad at some stupid marketing or game design decision.  So every month they have a different PR disaster to keep people coming back for more.
---
September: Anet hates midgets.  
---
October: Anet hates ~~Engies~~ Necros.  
---
November: Anet loves Quiznos.  
---
December: Anet hates ~~Chronos~~ Necros.  
---
New Years Resolution: Anet will continue to hate WvW.  
---
A new thing to bitch about every month!

Doesn't FFXIV have pretty good graphics?

You missed them, they were available from Oct 1-22 according to this post

The community isn't inherently nicer than any other game, it's just that the game was explicitly designed to limit the opportunities for toxic behavior, forcing us to be nicer to each other.
---
I feel like we have different definitions of a casual mmo.
---
I consider myself a casual player who logins  randomly through the month as time permits: do my daily if they are quick, get my login reward, check the gem store for free stuff. Every now and then I get some more time as will run around the map just helping others either doing events or hp. Basically whatever because I don’t care about raids, legendary, ascended or pvp. I don’t want stress; I just want to have a relaxing time running around and see other folks. 
---
To me guild wars fits my need perfectly. I can ask for help with a hp, JP , story or whatever and people always seem willing to help. Just random folks playing and in the same map. Because gw2 rewards this play style. Having played other mmos - asking for help with a quest or item...I’m usually told to google, figure it out or find a guild. Now don’t get me wrong there will always be helpful and non helpful people but majority of the time...gw2 player base wins every time.
---
Because of that I feel it makes it a very casual game. I don’t need to party or have a guild. Players don’t have to rely on me during finish an hours or two grind session during a siege. I can pop in, knock out what I want and have tons of folks willing to help.
---
It's a cesspool primarly because of the... I think schizm would be a good word here.   
---
Casuals have this holier than thou attitude towards hc crowd, crying how it's a casual game because of the manifesto from 7 years ago and how it's all the damn toxic elitists that are ruining their game because hc refuse to carry them and their funky and fun and I play for fun builds.   
---
And we are just really fucking tired of people who are so shit at a 'casual' game that every patch since Dulfy went silent they're asking for guides and where she is, but who still think that they're somehow better, because all approaches towards the game are cool, unless it's a hc approach that excludes them because they don't have enough skill and dedication to improve.   
---
Tl;dr it's shit because casuals because casual talking points are a 180° turn on hc talking points and both sides think the other is wrong. Which is dumb, because we could just keep ignoring one another at this point.
---
It's in a weird place too, because I swear when I checked back at the start of the year there were heaps of posts/videos from 2018/2019 saying how good the game is and how it's worth coming back to and what not.....then I install it at the end of the year and it must just be bad timing but since the whole template thing all the posts I see are rants.   
---
The saddest part imo is how good content creators are at promoting the game but how weird the community can be on forums, it doesn't look nice does it?
---
This one is going places.
---
Definitely worth it since your old account has access to features your free account does not.  Not to mention birthday gifts (probably 7 presents per character waiting), as well as mystic coins you probably had saved up which are worth around 1.4 gold each, instead of how they used to be only 1-2 silver..
---
Fixing mouse focus/interaction issues, especially with the top gui that they keep adding things to, would be essential (or giving us a quick way to toggle off mouse interaction with those elements) 
---
The moment you encounter someone with stacks of titles and buffs under their name, if your mouse happens to click near the invisible gui 'hitbox', bye bye mouse. It looses focus with the gw2 client, killing your mouse steering &amp; combat interaction, leaving you dead as your mouse is suddenly out-of-control and usually on a different monitor.   
---
Without fixing the mouse interaction, increasing boon/fx sizes and placing them around the screen would be an absolute nightmare.
---
You steadily optimize your rotation, the intricacies of your class, how you fight different enemies, etc., in other MMOs, too. It's not as though those are *all gear* and GW2 is *all skill*. It's They're both a little of each. 
---
Think about it like this: you're going to steadily optimize whatever skills it is that you do in your job, too, but that doesn't mean you're going to be happy consistently doing the same skills in the same job without getting a salary out of it. Perfecting your skills does have it's own reward, but you want to get something out of it, too.
---
I was a refugee from WoW during the launch of Guild Wars 2. The game certainly has what it takes to be something you keep coming back to. I hope you and your friend continue to enjoy your time together through the game!
---
I think it's an interesting game, but not if you enjoy an open world experience.  GW2 really kicks ass in that department. FFXiV is really an instanced combat focused game, and it excels at that for sure.
---
We've always had the nicest community, *within* the community. What we don't do is put up with bullshit.
---
Yeah, this is what I was afraid of.  I noticed if my side are winning then the points rack up a bit faster, but losing everything just stands still.  I guess I need a way to tag along with heal.
---
You’re making your argument based off his/her word choice rather than their actual meaning.
---
It’s more than fair to assume they are misusing the word aberrant and probably meant abhorrent. Or thought aberrant meant something else.
---
There have been numerous very consumer unfriendly decisions made recently and some very strange levels of community expectation management and build up for underwhelming announcements.
---
I think Guild Wars 2 has plenty of content and is well worth the price, but the person you are replying to clearly was stating the commonly held and vocal belief on this particular forum that Arenanet had made some very questionable decisions lately.
---
I see where you're coming from, and I take breaks after finishing an episode because I've accomplished enough in the game, raids, 7 legendaries, about 19k AP points. I go on, do the new story, 100% the new map, get about 80% of the achievements and redo it on another character - and then its break time. I then only come back to buy gems for new mounts and such. I empathize.
---
But for you, this is more of a slant against the lack of consistent and re-playable content that is rewarding (At least in PvE). Fortunately or unfortunately, the rewards are always going to be ignoring the gear mill formula that other MMOs have. The true end game is fashion wars
---
There could be other components that rub people the wrong way with this game, like the lack of community or cohesion with finding friends. The only way you can do this is either through a real life friend or through a guild. But at the end of the day, guilds are no longer being updated and people can't do any activities together. There is very little way to bond with someone, which is so important in an MMO if it wants to retain players. 
---
Theres just so much nuance things, but I personally dont think progression is the issue here - not in the way we see and expect in other traditional MMOs
---
Implying reddit was ever a place for the uber smart elite? =P
---
But the flavor's so on point! Necros are all about death and Chronos are all about time, and the constant changes and nerfs make Necros want to die and Chronos want to go back in time to when they were fun to play! Super flavorful!
---
Lol, yea, one might even refer to them as a "sweet summer child".
---
If you can't wrap your head around the concept of "time invested" in an MMO, that's fine, you filthy casual (that's a joke).  No but seriously though, you're an idiot. I honestly don't know how to have a conversation with a person who can't seem the "time invested" aspect of playing an MMO. It's like I would have to explain gaming to a moron.
---
As far as I'm aware, the path is completely random each time you do the fractal. It's entirely possible that I am absolutely wrong though. You just gotta keep trying to get the right route.
---
Hmm yeah I had a party member tell me the same thing so we reset probably 10+ times and got the same path every time. Super frustrating to be one off finishing the collection and just hit a brick wall.
---
My character is named Dardy Dat Dard - you may have seen me begging for gold or asking for a gf but I promise my inability to be rich or married has no direct impact on raid performance, maybe.
---
Wiki even says the path I need should be active right now.
---
Something I've noticed about Reddit specifically with gaming subreddits: Those who don't play usually post. Seems like everyone who enjoys the game doesn't have time to waste bitching about it on Reddit. Except those few of us that can't be playing it right now 😞
---
Let me log in and see if it works fine for me. Maybe there's something acting odd with how the fractal starts for you, or something. ANet spaghetti code and all that. Ill pm you the relevant info.
---
Appreciate that thx.
---
They said the path would alternate daily, meaning you always get the same path within a day no matter how many times you reset. 
---
The alternate part may be broken, just try again tomorrow and if not then have to wait for a patch.
---
Yeah it's strange bc I've basically waited until reset to try again all week and keep getting the Dolphin path
---
This is exactly the kind of thing I wanted to check for thank you!
---
But you're still here.
---
Overall, I think GW2 will be a good match for you guys.  Fractals are super fun in my opinion, but they do necessitate some skill progression -- if you want to do harder Fractals -- then you'll need to run stronger builds and learn to DPS.  Fractals scale in difficulty from #1-100, but the vast majority of the game's community tend to stop improving after #50. 
---
Once you pass #50 it becomes much more important to have competent survivability and DPS skills.   T3 (#50-#75) tends to be filled with players that lack the motivation to improve their gameplay, DPS or survivability skills.  People tend to have a very poor understanding of game mechanics (and Fractal specific mechanics) and are irrationally stubborn.   
---
T3 tends to be the complete and utter demonstration of the Dunning–Kruger effect because the game doesn't punish players for running weaker builds; but when you've spent 2 hours in a Fractal should take 20-30m tops that is its own punishment.  T3 is an experience. It's where all the GW2 optimization naysayers go to get drunk, watch netflix and spike eachother's drinks. Then they get mad that no one had a plan and continue drinking.
---
In response to your edit, do consider what value this adds to the subreddit. Similar sentiments have been posted ad nauseam and don't really bring anything to discuss except a circle jerk about how nice everybody is. That's not to take away from your intended message, just to point out why people would legitimately downvote it. Normally, most people would just ignore it, but the upvotes here are largely a pushback by people upset by all the negative responses the build templates and Quiznos partnership got.
---
TL;DR - People aren't toxic for downvoting a post that adds little value to the subreddit beyond circle jerking about the community.
---
Savage.

Oh my friend...you are *Breathtaking!*
---
You caught me! Anything I can help you with this fine evening?
---
Ohhh thank you!!!
---
Thanks! I am enjoying it for sure! You enjoy your weekend!
---
&gt;lol you are crazy. why would I adjust to some shit option when I can have other better option where I dont need to change a thing?  
---
The idea of changing my setting and force myself to like the place with lots of stupid people, when I can have other place with same stuff and without stupid people is god damn crazy.
---
Imagine calling the lowering of something as miniscule as your character model *limit,* shit. Like, it barely does anything to impact your gaming experience. But you're acting like I'm telling you to put everything on low, by the way you're overreacting. 
---
&gt; If some black dude would complain there is a racist club in the town, would you also tell him to just wear a mask, stop complaining like a child and go there anyway? 
---
As if that has anything to do with what I'm saying and it's *leagues* different. 
---
Honestly, the way you're being so aggressive against doing something simple is pretty amusing. You're acting like what I'm saying is horrendous, that your gaming experience would be ruined beyond repair. Cmon man, get a grip. 
---
Whatever dude, you do you. It's obvious that thinking rationally isn't your forte.
---
Thanks!!
---
No problem. Have fun!
---
So the only 2 legendary item you have are the Accessory and the Staff. And when you are on Template 2 you can't see any infusion. To be extra extra safe can you check that the Poly infusion is indeed not equipped on your Bifrost too by some random weird manipulation.

If the Bifrost does not have it (and it's the only other piece of legendary gear on Template 2 besides the Accessory) then it would look like this could warrant a bug report and/or a ticket.
---
If you look at your time spent playing a videogame as an "investment" then you are taking the whole thing far too seriously. There is no videogame worth seeing your time spent in it as a cost. The only thing worth investing in is something that improves your value and playing a videogame is never that.
---
You bring up me responding to a message as some proof of your superiority to me yet here you are taking your time to piss on some guy's parade because he is happy with a new game because you're bitter and can't move on. If you wanted to complain about the game you could have started your own post or replied to any of the posts complaining about the game. Instead you picked to shit on this guy. What do you get out of shitting on this guy's happiness. You thibk if you run him off from playing the game you'll be doing some sort of customer service? Maybe if you stop every new player you'll make that bad evil company rue the day they ever mafe you unhappy?
---
50k gimmick large hitbox benchmarks that didn't translate remotely to a raid, and it was even stated in the benchmark they spent hours RNG fishing. The standard benchmark that wasn't staff ele hovered around 29-31k DPS.
---
That's true for every long running MMO and no one denies that. What people criticise is the lack of communication, no interest in pvp and wvw and the bad marketing over and over again.
---
Looks like you are in zone where your mastery is maxed so you are just getting spirit shards instead.
---
Show us a screen of your mastery panel and tell us exactly where on the world you are gaining those levels.
---
And trust me, there is no mastery bug.
---
Agree that pugging is not a bad way to start. 
---
Just join a group, whisper to the commander that you are new and ask if he/she doesn't mind you joining.
---
How that can be Anet's fault? That fear happened because banned players pretended to be innocent and lied to others. 
---
It would have been great if people wait till Anet announces official statement. But they immediately started to blame Anet with this [meme post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dk94lq/anet_irl/)
---
.
---
Ayo so uh what does “pugging” mean?
---
Be chill and don't fret on mistakes big or small.  Becoming zen to everything is your biggest advantage.  Regardless of how serious you may consider raiding it's still a game at the end of the day and it's not worth feeling bad over.  Learn to care about your mistakes and familiarize yourself with mechanics, but recognize that raiding is meant to be difficult because it's about personal improvement, cooperation, teamwork, communication and repetition.
---
It happened on the weekends and dev answered on Monday morning...
---
It's just a matter of playing with friends and setting expectations then.  Try to label your LFG's appropriately when you need to pug; words like casual, everyone welcome, friendly faces like ":D" or just silly little quips will go a long way towards setting a friendly mood.  I'd suggest avoiding T3 pugs if you can help it; it's a very inconsistent experienced compared to the other Fractal tiers and that tends to ruffle feathers.
---
lol
---
Did the OP ask for the opinion of veteran players? Maybe he doesn't want the crusty opinion of a guy who claims they are done with the game but can't seem to move the fuck on. What you did originally was like seeing somebody dancing happily in the street and running up to them to throw shade at what they're happy about. If the OP wanted to view the opinion of unhappy veteran players all he needed to do was scroll through the subreddit or official forums, but I guess you weren't wise enough to consider that he had that option while you were busy stepping up to the soapbox to make his moment all about your own ego instead.
---
GW2's lack of a "general" LFG was a bit of a mistake that I'll never really understand. 
---
I really recommend finding a guild (try /r/guildrecruitment ) with friendly people - most of the LW content I've done with teams has been through there. 
---
The next best alternative is map chat in the zone. 
---
You CAN put something up in the LFG, but it's hit and miss as to whether anyone will see it.
---
Well as normal Power DH you dont give quickness :D You play him because it is high dps.
---
thanks mate
---
I think casuals are most likely the opposite to lazy fat humans.
---
Casuals are less gamer, prolly spend more time outside and dont want to invest too much time getting into Videogames. 
---
Prolly release less dopamine whilst playing.
---
It's not very good, but a good player can make it work.
---
You will have the same effect with your mounts if you own the Fractal Console Decoration in your Guild Hall and turn on Low-Gravity :)
---
*giant demon puppy, how cute
---
Read my other comment here with rude asura.
---
Thanks for the responses, yep shall just use my artificer to refine up the infusions, will not bother with the stat based infusions, even the ones without agony resist from WvW as i do not want to burn the laurels. 
---
I will try running some diagnostics on my connection in the near future to see if there is anything I can fix.
---
Given how much of a boon the terrible release of Blessed Online 1 was to GW2 I doubt they would be worried at all
---
&gt; They literally made the gamean endless grind that unless you’re putting 5+ hours a day in you can’t keep up with those that treat it as a full time job. That’s right, WoW is now a job that you must grind endless hours even in dungeons and mythic+’s just to keep up it have a chance at the gear you need.
---
I think we play a different game. I don't know what you mean by "gear you need", but I think it's the gear to see all content. Well that is the gear you need to queue in LFR. Which you can get currently by a few hour of gameplay after you reach max level. No other grinding needed.
---
Of course if you want max ilvl, you want to clear everything in the hardest difficulty, if you want to max your everything, you need a lot of grind, but honestly it's the same in GW2 too.
---
its on sale several times a year. you should wait for black friday sale at the end of november or maybe wintersday.
---
You use the word honest in first sentence and then proceed to lie in the next. Gemstore skins account for probably not more than 10% of all skins, as u/Lovaa mentioned. Hardly most of the skins.
---
Look I get that the skins in gemstore might look cooler than some free ones (still a matter of personal taste of each person), but you don't need to spend a single penny to look really cool. And there is no need to bend reality to prove a point.
---
About the last part on leveling? Because the first points are just facts. 
---
You probably haven't tried to raid and do high level fractals (CMs) yet. That's why I thought it was a bit odd for you to compare WoW end-game with GW2 leveling instead of leveling vs levelling and end-game vs end-game.
---
Some perhaps, others not necessarily. Depends on personal taste of each individual user, not the general "people".
---
And it's not like you can't get them any other way - last when I played (a good couple of months ago), the BL weapon skins were about 100g each when released, hardly a fortune.
---
Only if I can post on TP and pick up my bought items/coins.
---
Dont you regularly deal in extremes in this sub? Pot kettle...
---
They do go on sale but when is anyone's guess. It's worth it to buy though. 😊
---
I think the people that whine about other people should move on. I think shameless whiteknights should move on. The community isnt going in their fluffy direction and it is consuming them.
---
I understand why they rather have everything be feelgood and fluff. With that said I don't think they offer anything if value.
---
As for the downright toxic casuals, I think as a sub were learning how to recognise and downvote them and I'm proud of you all.
---
I'm very happy anet, whiteknights and veterans are all helping eachother in this vibrant community. Its slowly but clearly changing for the better.
---
That's me, but I use a poly black infusion as well
---
 I also like full permafrost
---
What makes you think you’re a piece of art?
---
Pugging is often way better than being in a bad guild. Raid training guilds come in two flavors, raid guilds that take newcomers if they're willing to get good or "super chill relaxed raid training guild don't worry play whatever you want" that doesn't kill anything and does not ask it's players to get better.
---
tbh most pugs will take you if their requirement isn't too high and if you state you haven't done the boss yet but know mechs and are good on your build. I'd personally advise to go for 90% benchmark on the golem before doing that though, as the peeps doing their weekly clear in pugs aren't there to be your personal trainers ;)
---
Hi. You cant ignore casuals ingame unless you filter them out and then they flame you on the daily.
---
As for wvw if I could filter out the casuals I'd be real happy.
---
Tbf one of the reasons he gave to be “pro templates” was, “also you can just make a new character and use different builds in different characters instead of  swapping builds, that’s what I do so templates aren’t really an issue” that coming from a content creator with +50 character slots is a bit lame to me said...
---
I am well aware of that. If one side, either us or casuals, was able to force the other, we wouldn't have the stuff we have now XD  
---
But since we can't, we'll try to wall ourselves off with kp and dps meters, and  casuals will shit on us because they can't get in.
---
PUG stands for Pick Up Group
---
I love eso a lot, especially with their dungeons. But coming back to gw2 from it made me realised how much I missed a giant epic world boss and map zone. ESO feels more cozy.
---
People would still lead public in wvw if you could do this.
---
Idk about wvw, I am bad enough with it to recognize that I'm much better off doing dalies than running with a zerg and being a rallybot
---
please dont start if u avoid raid for this time you are %100 casual bad player and raiding is not for you go buy gemstore skins and enjoy your roleplay's
---
It's to make everyone equal when hopping off their new GEMSHOP CHAIRS.
---
the complete user interface is a usability nightmare. whoever did this has no idea and zero ambition.
---
I run the ghostly outfit with twilight and the poly red infusion in shadow abyss. It's a neat effect.
---
what year is it?
---
Im in this picture and I don't like it.
---
&gt; the other dps players from your static suck badly
---
The players I'm talking about are players I won the 2nd ERP with, came in third on the 3rd ERP, or set raid records with. They're some of the best players in this game, they by no means suck. But hey, can you introduce me to some players who could prove me wrong? I'd love to meet them
---
Cool thx guys, i started looking for a sale for at least two months now so i guess it should be on sale soon.
---
I know you were trying to argue for me there, but he's right. You generally should always run FMW on DH, DMaw is pretty shit
---
I am not sure how positive posts like this refute any of the issues that us long term players are concerned about. It is a comment from a new player after all, who'll have a very different take on things than those of us who are thousands of hours in. We still need posts like this, and new players, for the game to remain healthy so I don't think this is the place for our criticisms or negative viewpoints. There are plenty other threads where we can express things
---
I'm pretty sure Plague doesn't like GW2.
---
Nice, thank you very much! :)
---
Well no, the most of the Time you dont play FMW.  Not even when the only ressource for quickness are Firebrands. DMaw is still a little dmg increase and helps (not very much) in cc phases. You dont play a DH for quickness. Good DPS is why you play him
---
so... your team is fighting and you are just back there...
---
Yeah people are really dishonest about gear progression. Whole gear grind argument is bullshit. It's a grind only if you want to be top player. For everything else gearing will be done by the time you finished doing story and running few new dungeons.
---
I use full permafrost too
---
And red glowing eyes and burning gauntlet for some reason.
---
[not as toxic](#s "Destiny 2 went F2P this October and The Crucible is open, no one is toxic and Lord Shaxx shouts praises whatever you do")

/looks at the hot friggin mess that is trying to get to t4 fractals without a guild to back you up
---
mmhmm, yup. sure ain't grindy.
---
(no i know what you mean, leveling is way less of a slog, but i had to laugh at that comment. Now I go back to the skyscale mines)
---
SAVE THE COWS!
---
Neat combo to cause permanent blindness indeed!
---
Finally resolution to the hanging story thread about Malyck!
---
Maybe throw in some phospholuminescent infusions aswell.
---
Something like that.
---
Also because the "shaq real shit" meme is hilarious. Alongside them fist of the north star memes.
---
So I'm gonna have red glowing eyes whenever I can.
---
Yea, official forums are usually really bad.
---
I played WoW way back in the day (EU open beta (2005) to 2009) and back then I spent a lot of time on Elitist Jerks (lots of theorycrafting).
---
I just picked up Guild Wars 2 as it seems to be good for solo (as I don't have the time for raiding or dungeons or even party play) and looked up the subreddit. There seems to be a lot of whining. Not much of real discussions about... well, anything to be honest.
---
If you have any tips on theorycrafting and the like, I'd love to have it.
---
The cult.
---
play an easy class where you can focus on boss mechanics instant of your own rotations like heal tempest
---
Why are you even here?
---
To fully respond to your questions it would be about 20 pages, but to sum it up the game is great for casuals, but terrible for hardcore veterans who only get joy from to raids, sPvP or WvW. If you want to know more you’d have to do your own research.
---
As far as toxicity goes it’s more or less just as toxic as it was a few years ago.
---
It's not really a matter of numbers though. The fact is that the coolest looking gear people strive for, is easily obtained by just dropping a few extra dollars in the Gem Store. (Gem Store is also incredibly over advertised, so the gear on there is also what people see all the time)
---
I can't speak for others, but I was unable to continue this game at End Game because I couldn't see a reason to play. Why grind for gold, when you can just drop a few extra dollars in the cash shop and be done?
---
They need to put more skins towards achievements or some other type of content. GW2 end game seems so flawed to me. They remove the gear grind and replaced it with fashion, but then they put so much of it in the cash shop.
---
Im in this picture and I do like it.
---
Dude there are so much achivements and collections out there that it is ridiculous. We get several sets every last chapters because we complained aobut this a while ago that there was not much and they changed and you get upgradeable sets, weapon sets to craft, and many of them are freking amazing, achivements sets, i can go on and please do not force me to go and count exactly how many but probably at least hundred of items we got just with the season and now the saga that have not even begun yet.
---
Haven't seen an Engineer in T4 fractals for months now and there must be a reason.
---
I think this also applies to raids.
---
Why switch to a new game if the main game mode you wanted to invest your time into get extreme neglect and underdevelopment from the game devs
---
Just a heads up -- each birthday box will give you some dye kits and some of the dye kits will have super-valuable dyes in them.  The best thing to do is to search for the dye kit in the wiki and check out the prices:

As long as they abuse the musical instruments to reset holoforge they are pretty decent

Try the jp cave at Malchor's leap, the light setup goes crazy there.
---
&gt;Is that really the best and most appropriate description you can come up with?
---
Given how its written? Sure that's the kindest description I've got for it.
---
&gt;well that is rather rude.
---
Nah it really isn't.
---
1. You wont be saving Tyria while hanging out in Lions Arch
---
2. Not sure what waiting tables has to do with your picture.
---
I think you've hit on some other issues that the game has for player retention, but that doesn't mean that a lack of some kind of gear progression can't be another one. 
---
For example, the fact is that many MMOs could be described as having a lack of consistent and re-playable content, if you are going use the same standard as GW2 has had. For periods, this game has had as frequent content updates as any, and some of it has been pretty replayable - most notably for me the LW3 maps. Those were the first kind of content in the game that I ever really wanted to keep going back to. They reminded me of the daily quest areas that other MMOs have.
---
The one difference between the content in this game - be it new raids, a new fractal, or new story maps - and in other games is that other games have extended that content by tying gear progression to that content. You keep replaying the content because you get better and better gear as you do it. For the most hardcore, this still doesn't really change things as they grind it out as fast as whatever time gates exist permit, but for the average and more casual players it can take weeks or months to finish the latest tier and it just makes that content feel more replayable to them. One might argue that it's not *really* any more replayable and it's just an llusion, but the thing is that true or false it doesn't matter: what matters is the player's experience, and if the player feels like he's getting something out of replaying the same content he's going to enjoy it more and that's what matters in the end.
---
I will agree with you especially about the social aspect. I have never been able to put my finger on exactly why (the general lack of organized content may be one reason) but from the very beginning it's been one of the least social games I've played. I think in particular this really hurt the PvP area of the game early on and and helped to dig it a hole it never recovered from.
---
if gw2 was an over the shoulder action rpg  that was slowed down to the speed of a souls borne it would work great
---
but it's not so it doesnt
---
Sometimes i imagine those "new players" are the PR team. But they are telling the truth though, for new player... well, even existing player like me this game is great! The system(?) I mean the whole leveling, gear grinds, shared everything from loots, storage, achievements, barbie collections etc... are way different from WoW and FFXIV. But some people still craving for gated progression like gated drama BiS gear for show off (token/raid gears for example).
---
How can you be so full of yourself and yet so wrong...
---
People always ask about state of the game.
---
What about game of the state?
---
You're thinking rarity.
---
Got all elite specs for all chars, both HoT and PoF. But thanks!
---
Regarding #2, his arms are locked outward, resembling the way a waiter might carry several plates of food.
---
Some of the best "Glamour" as its called in FF is tied to the cash shop, I think that's why this guy is thinking you need gem items for Fashion Wars. (thats on top of being a sub fee).
---
And if you were playing FF 2-3 hours a week it would take 6 months minimum to get to endgame. The main story quest is about 700 quests now.
---
They are the original drawing given of the Flatwood Monster.

I get that he has an extreme number of character slots but it IS a good way to handle things. And this isn't new. People have known basically since launch that character slots are a better value than bank tabs.
---
Guess illnjust say guild wars 2 is trash! Since my comment saying it wasn't my cup of tea got downvoted.. Seems there are some insecure gw2 player's.  I would be too if I liked that garbage.
---
&gt; This acquired skill in turn made me able to solo stuff in open world as well as in episodes of new stories.
---
Your comment was fine until here. It's barely possible to fail story mode missions unless you're going for certain achievements, regardless of how bad a build is. It's also very difficult to find open world content that can't easily be solod unless you mean like, world bosses. Aside from that yeah I would agree instanced content does make you learn how to play the game better but fotm is a poor example of that. Legacy dungeons teach you how to play better way way more so if you try to solo them or learn how to do them efficiently than modern day fotm could ever. You could pretty much learn how to play better by going in special forces training area in LA aerodrome than fotm these days because it's far less strategic to speedclear fotm than it is to speedclear dungeons.
---
Lmao exactly. 
---
Full Expensive Dye =/= Stylish
---
SPvP is kinda of a outlier. All PvP scenes have toxicity. Instagram? Do peopel chat through there? Isn't it just an ego stroker?
---
Occasionally you still find good topics of discussion here but it's rare.
---
This is even more true for lower tier raiders. Better do a good dps (a) class(es) you handle well that force yourself to play one that you're mediocre at. I'm personally terribad at thief, my dps will be half what it is on most other dps classes even when the rotation is supposedly braindead. So if thief (replace thief with anything else depending on current meta / situations) is top of meta or benchmarks, I'd better play a class that does 80-90% thief dps on paper and be at 90% of that class' best performance rather than try to play thief and be at 40% of its best performance.
---
That's awesome! I've always "created" my own builds. That seems to be precisely what I was looking for.
---
Thanks!
---
This is the best thing to happen to Quiznos since the Sponge Monkeys.
---
For me it's just that boons really aren't meaningful. Everyone applies almost all of them. Everyone applies might. Boons in a party are always on you. Same thing for conditions. I don't feel like there's any weight to them. Though conditions aren't as bad as boons, at least some conditions are rare like weakness. But once again, in a party almost all condis are covered at a near or near constant.
---
It's boring.
---
Give classes identity. They need to stop being afraid of that. Homogenizing them was the biggest mistep they did. And again, this combat doesn't know what it is. And those 3 things together make for some flawed combat mechanics that really need to be retuned and reworked.
---
Trump. 
---
I know, I know, don't through politics around. But that's your shitstorm there. I'm still surprised you guys aren't all bankrupt yet.
---
This is so cursed
---
The President doesn’t have much at all to do with the economy. Fiscal policy is largely carried out by congress, while Monetary Policy is carried out by the Federal Reserve which is primarily a private run institution. The President has limited power over either. 
---
I don’t like Trump and his trade wars have certainly had a negative impact on American consumers, but the American economy itself is going through one of the longest periods of growth in history, and Americans are more well off than they ever have been in history even adjusting for inflation.
---
That's how I calculated it.

Mine as well.  Condi qFB is incredible.  It does great damage on a lot of the more irritating Fractals as of late such as Aquatic or Siren's Reef and has a lot of innate strength via F2 &amp; F3 tomes.
---
The cheapest it's ever been in 520 gems during the 2018 sales, though I doubt we'll see that again since 600 seems to be more common. Until then you can just make Mystic Salvage kits with the countless Mystic FGorge Stones you no doubt have cloging up your bank
---
Wow, I never thought of it that way... Are you stupid?
---
Wasnt there a time where cengi did 36k aswell? Funnily enough it were all specs except holo that were powercreeping in pof. Holo was like 33k or something on release while 50+k broken builds existed.
---
What if we don't play every day, or play on the weekends? What if I want to do content at my own pace?

Why should I get punished because some people have too much time on their hands?

Nope. Still looks like a long lost twin from the shining.

&gt; Is the community as toxic as it was a few years ago?

25% is toxic, 10% is afk, 50% are bots, That's the sad reality.  
---
It's more then likely to be put in a match with bots, toxic players or afk/idle players 9 out of 10 times.
---
I had two or three bad experiences where I had to wait for email replies, no phone number, no human to contact.

But, that was many years ago.  like 2006/2007
---
Welcome back to Tyria!
---
Nice to hear. I just want to do a "chilled" comeback to the game, maybe enjoy a few unranked PvP matches and a little roaming once in a while (I can play more or less 3hrs per week).
---
Thank you very much for your input mate, much appreciated :D
---
Condi weaver is decent on gorse but it sucks during split and pweaver has higher boss dps than dh but with dh you can split in 4subgroups. Again if you just want a dps and its not a 15sec phase adina thing dh isnt the best dps option especially if you dont play sword.
---
And why do you play firebrand instead of cweavers on sab? Is it because of quickness by chance? Fb dps is high but full music holo can reach 23k+ aswell there. 
---
The main problem is that dh brings quickness + utility on top of ridiculous burst which got even buffed with sword and it instantly stacks 25vuln which was the whole point of holos in old compositions and you still can replace the dh in the chrono group with another dps especially if you dont split in 4 subgroups and if you just split in 2 a weaver would have higher dmg aswell.
---
Yes
---
that's a shame to hear that! I hope i could enjoy the game without the need for microtransactions. Even though, I guess a should use a few gems to unlcock those Living Word quests that I did miss in the last few years!
---
Who wants to read a bunch of repetitive fluff and anet jerkoff all day? 
---
Oh we're such a nice community. The nicest community! And we play the best mmorpg! It has no flaws - none at all! Anet is such a great company for making the bestest game for the friendliest community.
---
Reminds me of trump's speeches. We build the greatest wall. Impenetrable! 
---
Its not true, but they keep repeating it because it's what certain people want to hear. As if that will somehow make it true.
---
You're damn right !
---
All good bud agree to disagree! Have a great weekend!
---
I raid with what most would consider a low tier group, we're super casual and don't really care about speed just getting our weekly clears done and not trying too hard which is just how we like to do things. I can confirm that people playing on classes they're comfortable on is more important than running strictly meta at least for us specifically. Honestly if we did try to run meta we would probably struggle on everything judging by what happens when we have 1 or 2 people on something new and everything becomes a mess almost immediately.
---
the only good post i seen in this subreddit for few days and still %35 casual downvoted that funny game
---
*laughs in shadow violet* totally not me. No, sir.

I actually thought the same about build templates since ARCDps implemented them and turned out that I was wrong.
---
Now a bit OT... don't know how familiar people are/were with KaruulAlerts (for RIFT players it should be known), being an outdated third-party addon that could track boon/s, timers and warnings (aka visual helps, wink-wink), fully customizable... would be a great tool but it reads quite a lot from the memory and maybe that's against ToS (or maybe not). Woulda-shoulda-coulda.

TIL only children want or deserve positive reinforcement in their lives, huh.
---
...What?  I loved using those traits.
---
holy shit you know you're talking to LEFT right? Dude outdpses me, and I'm in like 4 or 5 raid records.
---
First, research encounters and watch playthroughs so you understand each mechanic the boss may do as best as you can, and how to avoid them. 
---
Buy a tag, start an LFG for a meme pug any time you want. Meme pugs are like reverse elite pugs, feel free to kick anyone who has too many LI or starts pointing fingers at people who aren't doing so great, keep doing that until you have kills!
---
But, that's probably not the BEST way. Apparently there's raid discords out there. I've played enough raiding with my guild to get my precursor armor, but haven't raided in the past several months because pugging is either very obnoxious with hyper elitists who will DPS shame perfectly reasonable damage, or you just won't get results.
---
That, and i'm swimming in ascended armor to begin with, legendary armor is kind of a weird flex that I don't care too much about.
---
no waiter ever would carry plates of food like that because it requires way more strength compared to carrying it angled and around the height of your waist, rather than your shoulders.
---
I think I'd prefer to see it as a consumable. Masteries are forever, and permanently halving fall damage for anyone with the mastery seems bad to me. You need to have a cost to it somehow.
---
Maybe make it a potion artificers could craft? It still remains niche but now anyone can use it regardless of traits when they need it.
---
I got 3 - 3.5 years out of it before I got bored. Not bad in my opinion.
---
happy cakeday mister stompy :D
---
How so? Is there a summary of events or a link about what's currently happening?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dmrq2p/merchandise_collector_anet_when_will_you_fix_that/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share posted this a few weeks ago, no dev replies, even got less upvotes than character drawings and ingame cosplays.
---
I actually have a few stones yes, but i did create a bank character to store all my unidentified blues and greens and my silverwastes bags to do a big oppenning. And i eant to do it when i finally get my discounted copper fed, so i hope it's soon

Hello u/MaklorGW2,
---
i love your app! But one thing that disturbs me is that the minimized bar is too big. i dont know where i should place it for quick access.
---
I would like to have one small icon that opens the window. Or make a shortkey that toggles between system tray and open window.
---
[Something like that.](https://imgur.com/a/AvfU0fh)
---
Thanks for your work!
---
Like I would even try to recognize names in this reddit and attache those to IGNs lmao.
---
That's kinda the part i am having bit of gripe with, it's neat how story progressed with dragon stuff and gods, but now it all feels kinda like Dragon Ball, with each new stuff kinda having to one up the one before it, else the it might feel jarring to look back in the story. It's kinda one of reasons i and plenty other people meme on how GW2 is more of a Dragon Age, than Dragon age, and Dragon Age is more like GW2.   
---
I mean our character has kinda stayed consistent throughout the story, some bits of development here and there, but since we weren't allowed much of diverging paths, PC kinda had to stay in middle to least not draw too much expectations out of bunch of different people.  
---
I myself have grown bit tired of elder dragons and would like if we could focus more on stuff like Cantha or Mists and origins of world and gods. I know gods are kinda being written out of story along with most potential development of mist lore(i mean all those ghost characters that were brought back for a bit during Kralkatorrik eating time and space, only to go poof).   
---
I hope at least next expansion will deal about norn, their own origins, icebrood and perhaps even add bit of info on what being a champion to elder dragon can have as an effect on Commander.
---
The ones that got removed are the 3 free build templates, not storage.
---
&gt;I think the people that whine about other people should move on. [-Etheri in this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dt2t0y/when_youre_down_here_youll_float_too/f6vw1gk/)
---
Oh, the irony.
---
Nope, because you're not gaining back the armor slot you used for WvW.
---
When ok boomer is used in a gw2 comment thread, I think we have hit peak "ok boomer"
---
Get the GW2 UI on a game that actually gets content updates and balance patches.
---
This so much nothing annoys you more than to realise you play your pve condi build with the pvp power amulet or vice versa.
---
You've probably heard this advice a million times from other people. Just don't. You'll feel ready and willing to play when you are ready. Trying too hard to rekindle the spark will end up pushing you away from the game. I struggled with the same issue for a few years trying to force myself to 'rekindle' my spark for the game. Now I don't even play the game anymore and I don't regret it. But I know if I truly want to one day play again, I know I'd get the spark back. If it's not coming back, that's fine too, not gonna force it either. So, cut yourself some slack and let nature run its course!
---
&gt; 30 skills was maybe 10 years ago. Class design has been optimized, pruned and streamlined, now it's about 15 spells used more than once per 10 minutes. 
---
...and they're backing up on that in Shadowlands, because every class feels samey right now, but at the same time builds within the same class feel like totally different classes. Every class has a heal, a big defensive cooldown, a sprint equivalent etc., but Survival hunter differs from MM hunter so much they might be separate classes.
---
The 'build storage' are the **actual** skill&amp;traits templates on to the left of the skill &amp; trait *loadouts*.
---
Which, by the way, should have a button to put them in 'client-side' mode so you can store them on disk without limits, since 24 slots are way too few for templates.
---
what a load of feel-good nonsense
---
basically a wall of text for "if you don't have have anything nice to say stfu"
---
newsflash: critism leads to improvement! crazy, right?
---
and how does criticism stop new players from having fun again? and gtfo with "a bit of imperfection"..people quit the game over shit like templates and wvw! they aren't random qq, they are legit tipping points
---
it's fine that english isn't your first language, because your lack of basic reasoning transcends any sort of linguistic barrier
---
good for you dont play game then mr professor you are too good for playing or you can waste ur money on gem skins since you have a lot of money ok ? :D
---
What armour and dyes are those? Looks amazing!
---
WvW and PvP didn't have dedicated equipment slots, only separate skill &amp; traits. PvP also stores stats and upgrades.
---
There is a fine line between critic and complaint.
---
In case of this subreddit it's mostly the second tho.
---
The second fine line with critism is how it's viewed from the outside. A new player who comes to this sub may not understand why longterm players are talking about a topic like Build Templates in a negative light. What they see is that people ARE talking about them in a negative light.
---
And what they also see are people like you.
---
IDK if I was ever good enough at this game to get any mystic anything lol, but maybe if you just get them when you make a character??? I think I mostly just liked watching the intro animations, so there was no "gameplay or "strategy" or "skill" happening with my GW2 experience
---
This is the best time to get pips though.
---
Go Permafrost + Gray infusion. Looks super crisp.
---
Why are you bringing so much negativity to this awesomely positive community post?
---
Nice trolling
---
Punk
---
Hey! I saw you yesterday! Im the robot that talked to you yesterday at divinity. "Your fashion has been uploaded to the database." small world.
---
Keep rocking that fashion!
---
Not really negative, just saying is it the same one, if it isnt then great if it is then people who already claimed it will know.
---
A post in which I copy pasted half my sentences from the person I'm replying to. 
---
I understand you dont find it ironic, but this sub whines as much about "whining" as it does about anet. 
---
You'll happily whine about how whining is boring and you still dont recognise the irony. Yet others copy paste the argument and apply it to the other side of the argument and the REEEEEEE ensues.
---
Clearly you dont enjoy this whining and as I outlined in the post you linked, it wont stop. When do you leave?
---
They kinda creepy
---
Nope, you can't unlock the elite specializations until
---
A) you're level 80
---
B) you've maxed out everything else already. So all other skills and traits for that class
---
I'm sorry what do you mean? This is not a troll post
---
They are not random, they are related to Gw2 and add value to the subreddit by being nice to look at. Really simple, not every post needs to be a fucking rant. If you'd like that go make your own subreddit and drown in negativity.
---
I actually prefer specs to be unique from each other by a lot. If multiple specs play similar to each other, why even have them beyond visuals?
---
There's lots of content other than group PvE that could benefit from a UI change like this (solo HoT, roaming wvw, playing anything other than the bunker in pvp and even then). It'd be useful if we could move and rezise every element in the UI, or even toggle them on/off just like FFXIV. There isn't really an argument against this convenience in a tab target mmo, because there isn't enought visual feedback on your character or enemy for every piece of possible information.
---
zealot insignia is bit above 2g, celestial isn't much more, if u reallt care about few years from now you could easily get 30charged quartz in that timespan, it'd take 1min/day (even less if you do daily home instance farm)
---
Just being toxic towards someone that's trying to help you is kinda retarded, they're 100% correct it's better to statswap towards stuff u need now instead of holding off on it because a) it cheap af to statswap and b) you could get new pieces in the meantime that u can keep as zealot/celestial even though they'll never really become usefull.
---
Is Trump by any chance leading Arenanet now or what the hell??? Can't they recognise how active is the rest of the world appart from those two countries in their game??
---
Pff this is probably one of the best prizes u can win but again EU gets shafted :(
---
i cant even win cd key if im not in NA?
---
yup but its still limited quite honestly i dont understand why they do flying mounts this way pretty much no other MMO game does.....the whole extra abilities is cool but the main reason flying mounts are cool because usually you get UNLIMITED USE from them while your in the air. apparenlty it has some sort of bar that depletes when you do certain things.. really stupid in my view .  sure it might have some "fun" features for players but for me the point is being able to just fly around the world and explore at my own pace. for a game that is supposed to be about freedom of choice and playing your own way youd think they could at least impliment a flying mount that doenst rely on some silly meter mechanic. just make the damn thing fly without a meter without any other stupid gimmic.  How hard is it to fuck that up? Lol

The rest of the world is plenty active, but Arenanet is still based in the United States, and there's a lot of bureaucratic red tape that needs to be pushed through to run a contest like this in other countries.  Translations into many languages would be needed, the rules for each country and region and the EU itself would need to be followed.  It's a lot of effort to put in, and not necessarily something Arenanet has the manpower to do.  Programmers and artists and such aren't always capable of the legalese required in porting these contests to far-flung areas.
---
It is only removed if you cared for having separate builds for pvp and wvw. I got 2 new PvE build slots free.
---
You need to identify what drives you to play this game. I've also been disconnected from it for a few months, yet I constantly have a feeling in the back of my head like 'that games amazing, I should go play it'. Then I hop on to see nobody on in my guilds (but VIP is still recruiting) wvw is a ghost town, takes ages to queue in pvp and a solid chunk of players there shut on newbies trying to figure it out. Dungeons/fractals are just another daily to rush through AFAP, all of the above discouraging me from even attempting raiding, considering the resources it requires in other games. I love so many principles and mechanics in this game, but mechanics are only as fun as the content you're given to operate in.

---
I mean both sides got their bad people, don't forget we got told plenty by toxic casuals to just quit the game and are bad people for enjoying raids.
---
You shouldnt judge a community by a tiny percentage, because the actual dedicated above avg raiders and such don't do that here. Twitch chat is unimportant, whatever is said there fully depends what kind of stream it is and people spamming kill the game can just be an inside joke/meme combined with twitch chat being 99%trolls I wont keep those people in mind because Twitch chat should always be taken with some salt.
---
I havent played the game in months and havent visited starting areas in ages, but I do believe there will be some toxic people who would do this and they should quit.
---
People downvote loweffort, including both just shitting on the game and white knighting anet, posts and bad art/yt vids/stupid questions. Actual good/deserved praise doesnt get downvoted any more or less than any other normal post. Just because we're having useless low effoert praise posts for no actual reason (and even those "OmG bEsT cOmMuNiTy EvEr" still get upvoted)  downvoted doesn't mean this subreddit mass downvotes people genuilly happy with the game and put effort in stating why.
---
*sad non-na noises*
---
I don't think it's as open and shut as you're making out. Not everyone has time to spend on learning all the best-in-slot professions, so it becomes more a question of, "Do I want people who are good at what they play, or do I want people who are mediocre at what's good for this boss?"
---
Partner present worldwide, promotion only for NA. Just wtf. Isn't it the 2nd time it happens with alienware ?

I did full shadow abyss at one point, but I ended up trying to match my dyes to my spell effects.
---
So on my reaper I've got [dark/ice blue, green, and a bit of dark grey/black.](https://i.imgur.com/czIlq8b.jpg) I just tried to do my best to match the jewelry/buttons on my chest piece with the everything else.
---
If only the in-game lighting would cooperate. Sometimes it matches perfectly, then it other times it looks totally mismatched.
---
You can actually use any dye in the dye panel however you want, even locked ones. You just can't apply any you don't have!
---
so picture of some rat,made by some1 ADDING something to this subreedit? :DDD k
---
Well, that's true. We have 200k people here, the game has arguably way more people playing it.   
---
But then, don't you think that those people who 'just play' will play whatever, so it could be more sensible to try to cater to redditors?   
---
It might not be the best idea, after all there are basically two camps atm, but anet is not communicating at all is in my opinion a liability, since, as I said, we have something to say, and people who just play don't care.
---
The dodge roll will have to be perfected. I see the demand for Xera instances being purchased going up.
---
Adele knows your feel
---
Yea we've needed customizable UI since launch. Won't happen cause Anet doesn't prioritize stuff like that.
---
To all the peeps saying play the game not the UI, i hope you enjoy losing in sPvP because you HAVE to read the UI to know when to do things.
---
Although I’m not in the gaming business, my company does have more trouble doing business in Europe than in the United States, and I wonder if there are rules and regulations in place that just make these kinds of promotions too difficult or too expensive to be worth it in Europe.
---
Noted, thank you! I was going between matching music/keeping it speedy and doing a full walkthrough, but I wasnt sure if it'd stay interesting during the slower parts without tips. Will try to strike a better balance next time!
---
I really think that trait needs a buff now that they've removed the fall damage reduction.
---
I have the weirdest deja vu right now
---
It most likely has to do with bureaucratic red tape. Dealing with EU laws sucks at times.
---
&gt;  But then, don't you think that those people who 'just play' will play whatever, so it could be more sensible to try to cater to redditors?
---
There is a vast difference between playing what you enjoy, and interacting with that community. I've never interacted with the community for many games, but if the games changed directions and I didn't like that direction, I'd stop playing.
---
Just because they're not interacting with the community outside of the in-game community, doesn't mean they don't care. Nor does being on reddit mean you care.
---
Using a third party site to judge whether someone enjoys and care about the form of the game is far from a proper method of judging.
---
“Child of Earth” for Ranger feels really cringey.
---
You both made me cry with necrotic nostalgia... Even the casting animations back then were on point, now everybody looks the same.

Yeh I have  "mysteries of the unexplained" book from the 70s and the picture of these used to scare the shit out of me as a kid.

Nope, shadowlands is shit, and "we're repruning abilties" is just pandering to hide the hilariously glaring absence of real class changes or actually new features.
---
As someone who's not done wintersday in a long time, what's the winters day Karma farm?
---
Yup. The karma booster is better than the enchanted boost.
---
And remember, you can get a weekly karma booster if you do a weekly key farm and continue to level 40, and other nice stuff up to level 60.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Key_farming#Rewards
---
Big prices and no 20$ to deliver it to eu.
---
You use those after dying, not before.
---
So you need like 10000 hero points to max all skills/traits?
---
wont play it.  dangerous that your phone is always on the charger.
---
It is supposed to say "templates suck" but it got removed by Anet.
---
There's people who like to dedicate their time to a single hobby, and become masters at it, be it a classic board game like chess, a sport like football, or a videogame.
---
Incredible, right? Who would have guessed!

Yeah honestly I played wow with this add-on way before I even knew what guild wars 2 was lol. Now I have recently moved over to guild wars 2 and I'm like... Damn I know this ui
---
Don't play it. There's many other games that are more worth your time that are much more enjoyable.
---
Ok so being in New Zealand the ping sometimes really gets to me. 300 or so ping is pretty standard but sometimes it spikes up to 3000 which for lack of a better term makes the game "rather unpalatable". I'm wondering whether there's any kind of function which essentially 'isolates' you to allow you to play completely solo, essentially 'disabling' the need for the game to let me see or meet other players.
---
Or is that some crazy demand that players who don't know about servers would ask about and actually be crazy expensive and thus not a common practice by default?
---
\*cries in spanish\*
---
There is no offline play for the game.  The ping is something you'll have to deal with.
---
You might have better luck on a North American server if you're currently playing on EU, or vice versa, but that's not terribly easy to check.  Your best way to test that out is probably to create a new F2P account on the other set of servers and test it using that.
---
The wait feels long but i'm not in a rush either
---
learn your class rotation
---
Everything can level to 80 just fine.  The open world isn't hard, you can build a deliberately bad build and still manage.  Core Necromancer won't be the strongest class, but it can still get things done.
---
And if you enjoy playing it, that matters more than playing to a meta, especially when levelling where it really doesn't matter much because there's no super-hard content for you to do.
---
it's true that the conversion from karma to gold is rather bothersome, and many people might not find much use for it after unlocking all cultural weapon skins, LS3 skins, etc. however should a significant and attractive sink for karma arise one day you can't just go and convert into karma first. it is inherently (orphan farm aside) a currency that slowly accumulates over time as a byproduct.
---
even if karma itself doesn't interest you all that much id still advise against converting the boosters into enchanted ones as the conversion rate (2:1) is rather punishing, and the old 50%MF booster effect (imo the only interesting choice from the enchanted booster) is relatively easy to come by through other ways, e.g. the fireworks we got for free from halloween and dragonbash.
---
To elaborate: Are you at the right crafting station?  Make sure you're at a Tailoring crafting station, and not a Jewelling or Weaponsmithing one.
---
well I just logged an half hour ago. Did a few PvP matches and got insulted for my build not being meta. You probably right. Anyway, I'll just finish PoF and probably switch back to gw1 lol. I have to admit that playing the game with friends did represent 80% of the experience at the time.
---
Cheers!
---
8.5 for your mental gymnastics but you didn't stick the landing.
---
Yes, I am on the right one.
---
Oh well, I just don't appreciate someone telling me to do something without a reason, even though from an expert. Giving some context to the advice, as you did right now, would have been way better than "this gear is trash, don't use it in group". Kinda makes me laugh.
---
cheers
---
Once Anet revives the one in my city I hope I'll be able to order subs with gems.

Having a small inset window showing the PoV throughout could work :)

*Laughs in gem store*
---
Thank you sir. This is only one for GW2 related.
---
I have seen the light!! I also changed the description on this post to reflect this intel! Thanks for the warning!
---
Where's the trick? Who's getting malware this time?
---
I agree.  But this is post HoT/Colin Anet.  They don't care.
---
No communications, as saying anything might lead us the players to, you know, expect something.
---
You can't miss expectations if you never make any.
---
Its what Anet do, look around the reddit and forums, templates go live, then we get days and days of complaints, and comments, Anet eventually make a post saying, we are reading the feedback and discussing it on how to address it, and since then the posts have died down, in Anets minds thats paramount to the community accepting the templates now and have moved on, 
---
Its not the first time this has happened, back in August after the announcement, again it was meet with days of complaints/comments, until a dev on twitter stated that death threats where too much, this moved the topic, and when that dev was asked what threats the reply was, well threats in general to other devs in the industry, and that killed nearly all the topics on the announcement, 
---
Anet are very effective at shutting down complaints/comments on a topic they dont want, if the topic in question hasnt been picked up by 3rd party websites then they just delete everything on the topic, if it has been picked up, then they make a post like, we acknowledge your comments, and will get back to you, but very rarely do, this is usually followed up by a post about another update, that then diverts the attention to a new topic, and so the process continues, 
---
This system for them will continue as it works for them, until people see for themselves they are just being ignored, and the feedback they give really isnt worth anything.
---
I've been laser focused on gold-payout for currencies to help a friend with her Legendary for so long, I'd honestly never even considered all the other karma sinks ingame. I should pick up some of those cultural and LS3 skins!
---
just get it in your head, anet as a company does not care and they will not change their company policy. they do simply not care what anyone in forums or reddit writes. its simply a tool so users can write a bit shit off their soul and then there is a nice and cozy trash bin.  
---
they did not change in 19 years, they will not change after 20...and they will definitly not change gw2 for those 7 years which it is out.  
---
they do their thing and you as a player can only do one thing: play along or move away.  
---
guild wars 2 is a pretty good game, but don't be fooled. there are a ton of other good games out there which are good as well and while they may lack in certain departments, they do some things better then gw2. once you experience that, you will see it, so give it a try if you have enough.
---
While checking the wiki for more things to spend Karma on, I have found that this boost effect CAN be obtained from the Candy Corn Gobbler as well!
---
I like going full permafrost to blind everyone who looks at me
---
Just let it go, what was the last time they heard us and changed their ways? Never. Closest situation was the mount RNG fiasco, but they NEVER removed the old rng ones, they just gave a way to buy select licenses in the future. So ye, the best they will do is fix the bugs and maybe give us another single freebie.
---
&gt;I as power weaver am yet to see any fractal god (+7% dmg) to out dps me as someone whos attunement is 0.

Very curious. Care to submit some of your logs then? Like, your today's cm run. I can give you some of my pug runs too, if you want. 
---
&gt;Being a meta monkey who only wants mirages in largos is nooby imo
---
Even more curious.  How  exactly wanting The confusion spam class on largos is, erm, "noobish"? You do understand that this doesn't have anything to do with blindly following some arbirtrary "meta", but with this build being absurdly effective there, right?
---
I spent time making Frostfang, I didn't invest it. That time spent was free time that I enjoyed spending because of the journey. I didn't invest time. There's a difference. Like I spent money on videogames. I invested money into my retirement. For being such a smart guy I thought I wouldn't have to explain that to you.
---
Like for example I spent a lot of time playing TOR but then the game had no more appeal and I quit. In the end I didn't regret the time or feel it was lost. I just moved on. It's really simple to do when you're not uptight.
---
No quiznos gift card giveaway? 😂
---
&gt; If I am demonstrably wrong about anything, I would appreciate a link demonstrating so.
---
I have no read the rest of the post yet, and it's still possible that I agree with your points. But this is not how it works. You're doing a burden of proof reversal. You're the one making 11 claims. If people disagree with anything you say, you're the one who have to prove what you say. The people disagreeing are not the ones who have to prove you're wrong.
---
You can run almost anything in open world and it won't make any difference. DH and FB use the same gear, and build templates go in a text file so there's no reason not to have the option to do both.
---
What I did was save the power quickbrand gear into a gear template and use that template for pQB and DH, the difference in damage from those three trinkets is minimal unless you're world-class speedrunner Minmaximus (Disclaimer: Minmaximus might not actually be a person that exists), and will serve you well enough.
---
I love it! The simplicity, the colours, it's great! When I was playing the two games I would use the UI to get used to both games at a time. 
---
You have to get used to not being able to dodge tho...
---
I had this fear when they first released it and it seems like it's a real thing. I don't have much advice as I unlocked it first week when most didn't have it, but you can also complete the steps in edge of the mists. This is a good way to get the keep done since you only need like 5 people to take one there.

I’ve never thought gw2 community was nicer than other mmos. In fact I believe it’s one of the more toxic community’s for an mmo because it’s free and caters to the casual.
---
I don't understand. Are these bullet points tips or the bad habits?
---
quit the game and move on.
---
or
---
quit whining and play along.
---
stop spreading negativity in this sub.

Sorry life’s been hard on you man :)

I totally support OP though, being in somewhat the same situation.
---
I read it more as it takes half of whatever health you're at... so if you're at half health, it takes 25%, if you're at 10% it'll take 5%.
---
I cant answer your question, but you shouldnt worry that much about spirit shards.
---
They are basically worthless because the effort to do anything with them is huge.
---
A lot of people sit on thousands of Spirit Shards and dont bother doing anything because its just not worth it.
---
Where's Charleys? I've never even heard of them.
---
Also a promo with subway would likely be prohibitively expensive.
---
Ah gotcha. I'm not familiar with the warrior one but most of them also trigger on heal skill now and I don't think that part is going away. Obviously the super hero landing fantasy is gone from warrior though which I can totally empathise with.
---
Quebec is usually excluded as well because of their laws.

How does experience for support/healing work?
---
If I just apply boons and heal my wife while she kills something do I get experience when it dies?

You don't have to let it go, simply quit, stop playing.
---
Try to learn reading comprehension, and then speak :)
---
That's the thing, I love elementalists and thieves but my insane ping (since I'm all the way in New Zealand) almost forces me to play "easier" or "more forgiving" classes since as an elementalist, by the time I switch to the right element I would've taken 3 to 4 hits already and as a thief my stealth timing and evades are super delayed and clunky.

Ui was one of the major hold ups for releasing the game. They had to redo it multiple times and we got stuck with this mess of a ui that is locked in place. We can’t rearrange skill bars or icon locations. Locked size of ui to 4 options.  
---
Now that I think about it they kinda just slopped it out there like every other lw story. 
---
Not surprising really
---
You will need the living world to max out your masteries
---
It is INSANELY shaved down compared to other MMOs, im talking like runescape, maplestory and WoW - any old school MMOs, and they're still around and active to this day
---
People who come to GW2 are already very pessimistic about any sort of grind because thats what the game is avoiding at conception, even if its small compared to other game, so when skyscale came out, it was a pain in the ass for us with that mentality. I honestly took about 1 1/2 weeks to get it and I complained about the currency requirement a lot in map chat. But if you're just comparing inwards, you can say a grind exists
---
I've got everything done except the helmet. I'm about half way through the reward track so I'll get there eventually.
---
Are you trying to rely solely on mining mithril or something?
---
You're going to hear a lot of off-base negativity towards Necro in general. For some reason a subset of the community decided a long time ago that Necro is always bad and always gets nerfed to death. The reality is very far from that and Necro is extremely strong in all game modes and even meta defining in WvW.
---
Necro is probably the most forgiving class to play on pve, and it only gets better once you can get reaper unlocked. Its inherent tankiness with the second health bar and the option to run minions makes it very good for all of this.
---
Minions are a very easy playstyle that will get you through most open world content. Do note that it is also a very low damage playstyle overall, so if you ever get into group content it's not so good and you will not be contributing as much.
---
For clarity's sake, you don't need to prove anything to disagree. I've provided no links myself, so I'm not expecting disagreement to have more backing. Just don't say "you're wrong, look it up", as that doesn't help me correct a misinformed opinion.
---
I'm not demanding receipts, but would appreciate any you might have.
---
&gt;TIL functioning adults need **external gratification for stuff that required literally 0 effort or is borderline shit and/or worthless**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Nope. I've a veteran but **I've never understood the point of cheering  someone up because they got their first world completition, some shit  art, or a random screenshot.** 
---
Is there something i missed?? :)
---
Anet is seeing if it sells. If it does expect no or minor changes. If it doesn't sell expect minor changes or maybe even a extra free template or two.
---
I should probably re-ask a question: What would be good classes for a casual PvE player with constant high ping? I'm assuming Necro and Ranger (and maybe Engineer)??
---
I agree they're not being communicative enough.
---
Right now a good comparison is with Warframe: they dropped a pretty big update last week and there's been a hotfix patch pretty much every day since that directly addresses the pain points people have been talking about. The patch notes also include items like "we know people are having trouble with ____, we're working on a solution internally and should be able to share more soon."
---
It's crazy by comparison that this is the only communication from Anet since launch.
---
Me and the boys on our way to kite Qadim 2 pylons
---
You would have to be in the same party or squad with them. (Just right click on their character, name, or even character portrait.) Also under Options the last 4 deal with Health displays.
---
Aren't there class specific buffs in some other window?
---
Crafting/obtaining the precursor skins will automatically unlock the first tier.
---
ANET BAD!
---
Lmao, do you really think they or any other company can read feedback, find solutions and implement solutions in only one week?
---
I think you're over-complicating things. The wage-to-profit ratio is what matters, and it's what gets ignored most often in my experience.
---
Option 1) Pay dozens of people for two years to develop a full-featured expansion. Charge $50 for it.
---
Option 2) Pay half a dozen people for two weeks to develop a mount skin. Charge $20 for it.
---
Option two is a little less than 2/5 the income for less than 1/52 the work hours. That's it. That's the secret. You can sell a lot fewer skins and hit a good profit margin, so that's the better business model.
---
It's not about player retention or any of that shit, if it were they'd have community managers instead of "marketing manager" or whatever the title is.
---
Bullet points are tips. Do them.
---
i havent spent a dime on the game in a few months. i've just converted gold to gems for a few things. if they want my money, make it worth my while and they will have a guaranteed income from me. 
---
maybe ignore the character boost/elite spec from buying a character slot. but definitely keep the free gems for the value of the sub.
---
what i ask for is just digital, what they get from me is real.
---
This
---
alacrity is not class spcific, also F OP, no alac for u
---
Exp is just one of the sources but they also drop from mobs when you play on a lv80 as well as some other containers/chests.
---
I have not unlocked the Skyscale yet, but I have maxed all masteries that appear in my mastery tab. I currently gain spirit shards.
---
Fools! You must use black infusion AND shadow abyss!
---
better quality: https://www.facebook.com/GuildWars2/videos/545468312913657/
---
When you unlock all available masteries the game will recognize it and award spirit shards.
---
If you decide to get the missing episodes and unlock the beetle/skyscale you will once again need to max masteries to gain spirit shards - though I can't remember if they fixed it so you still get shards if you cap a mastery without unlocking it.
---
Sounds like another potential map specific mastery...
---
You get them in the silverwastes.
---
My advice would be look for RIBA in lfg central Tyria squads. RIBA is a farming method for that map where you move between the four bases tagging all the events and moving to the next base.(RIBA stands for red indigo blue amber the order you do the base defence events in) 
---
If you do it this way it will take 1-3 hours to get 1000.
---
I didn't misspell "fiend"
---
They never respected Norn Lore before why start now?
---
dw, people still dont know how to fight the Sirens Reef boss.  
---
Thats content, right? XD
---
No , I'm not playing gw2 anymore.
---
dont you have by any chance  **Tyrian Exchange Voucher?** (300 of those there)
---
Not this.   
---
Alacrity is not a class specific buff anymore.
---
Necro and Ranger yes, Engineer absolutely not.
---
I often feel like a lot of this sub have never worked in an office. I work in administration and I am still waiting on a manager to get us the name of a visitor from a supplier so we can get the VP to approve it. It's been a week since the incomplete request was first sent in, still nothing.
---
Like... Shit takes time to get done. Teams need to meet, data needs to be collected and analyzed, and someone will also need to mock up an idea for what will be a suitable fix. And they only have 5 working days to do this assuming no one is on vacation or out sick
---
Thank you for making it so clear :)
---
D'oh! I forgot about gems -&gt; gold. I rarely hear anyone talking about it, unlike gold -&gt; gems.
---
I considered the effect of drawing players back. Unless they follow the patch notes themselves or their friends let them know directly, how would players find out about changes? Festivals, promotions and new content send out newsletters. I have yet to receive one about a balance patch or fractal rework.
---
When you activate a raven shrine your browser opens a WP lore video.
---
you should buy that when it was about 3k insta .D
---
Already had forgotten about the Shinning Blade episode, guess it'll be similar then.
---
I bet :D
---
I wouldn't make that bet. We've known for a while that devs really want the mastery system to be as worthwhile as possible. They were really happy to bring back season 3 masteries in Season 4, and we also still have full glider and mount usage in the core game AND wvw too. Is it something that is guaranteed? No. But could it be implemented? Absolutely, if they had the time to make it so.
---
He will quoth the chat nevermore
---
Don't worry, it's not my arm. 
---
Only a fool would be 100% sure of anything and bet their own arm. 
---
So everything's fine no matter what happens.
---
forced positivity is seriously one of the most disgusting things
---
That is true. In that case I also bet that guy's arm.
---
Don't worry, they are holding onto all the unreleased fractals for when they announce a new mmo right after this Living World season ends.
---
I doubt it, I’m pretty sure the entire reasoning behind lumping HoT and PoF together in one price is so that they could start making HoT masteries relevant in current content, without having to worry about excluding players who didn’t have HoT. Doesn’t make sense if they then create new masteries that are locked to one area.
---
I'll give you an arm and leg and my little brother.
---
Meh, no vertical progression please.  GW2 is like the only AAA game without it.  Plenty of other options if you want that, none if you don't.
---
Nah i mean like no vertical progression means theres less drive to do horizontal things in the meantime, makes them less fun

[ARENA NET] [Robert Gee.9246 posted on 2019-11-08 21:06:08](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1092846#Comment_1092846):
---
&gt; Thanks for the feedback everyone. I've been following this thread and I wanted to respond to a some comments that have come up a few times:
---
&gt;**Stronger reses are not desired in PvP.**
---
&gt;We are looking at competitive splits for some of these changes but they haven't been finalized yet.
---
&gt;**Fall damage reduction is important in WvW.**
---
&gt;We hear you that fall damage reduction and gauging whether a fall will kill you is something that is considered regularly as a part of WvW. However we would like to see how the WvW meta adjusts before making additional changes.
---
&gt;**I need falling damage reduction for some jumping puzzles.**
---
&gt;Right now we think the only one that really needs it is Griffonrook Run because it integrates fall damage into the critical path (the red eggs restore health for this reason). We'll be adding fall damage reduction into the bomb buff as a result. We don't think this necessary for the other jumping puzzles at the moment but are open to adding it as the need arises.
---
&gt;**Can you kill yourself with Signet of Undeath's active?**
---
&gt;No. Health is a resource similar to Initiative or Adrenaline. The skill will simply be greyed out and uncastable if you don't have the required health cost.
---
&gt;**Medic's Feedback might be too strong.**
---
&gt;We are a little worried about it but not any more than the other revival changes. 
---
&gt;**Stalwart Courage (Courageous Return) is definitely too strong.**
---
&gt;Talked this one over with Cal and we're going to split the protection duration in PvP/WvW to 1 second. We considered an ICD for this trait, but think it's more interesting without it so we will only add one if this split proves insufficient to balance it.
---
&gt;**Why didn't you change Toss Elixir R?**
---
&gt;We did not originally plan to modify Toss Elixir R as we considered it fairly strong due to its 5 target cap and 170% total revive amount. With that said, we took another look at it and decided to make a few changes since there we felt that it being stopped by projectile destruction/reflection was too punishing for its recharge.
---
&gt;* Toss Elixir R: This skill no longer removes 1 condition when thrown. Increased projectile speed by 25%. The projectile thrown by this skill is now unblockable. Fixed an issue where the land and water versions of this skill moved at different speeds.
---
And my axe!
---
When you click the link and the first that hits you is the reality of the situation for the vast majority of the playerbase.
---
&gt;Thank you for your work. I like it. Didn’t cost me anything.
---
Quickness under "utility" though.
---
&gt; We hear you that fall damage reduction and gauging whether a fall will kill you is something that is considered regularly as a part of WvW. However we would like to see how the WvW meta adjusts before making additional changes.
---
The meta wont adjust since falling damage builds were never meta builds, only great niche builds for roaming. 
---
So meta wont change but great builds for roaming are removed, bad decision.
---
Thanks
---
It's still all white... no effort or theme put into it whatsoever.
---
No ... how about anet doing promos which doesn't 
---
neglect human rights in the first place, many countries have privacy and other rights for a reason...
---
What??? But not showing it *by default* already seems so counterintuitive..
---
But how do they view the WvW meta? Based on zergs?
---
Sure, roamers can adapt, but it’s not necessarily in a more fun way. The change will make using the terrain to your advantage more difficult, and I think that will just be less fun in general.
---
Well put. I’ve played through the entirety of LWS3 on at least 4 characters and I honestly couldn’t explain to you the story behind what takes the PC to each map. The “here’s why we’re going to a completely different side of Tyria” portion of the story always seems so random and rushed, with little to no set up in the previous episode.
---
TL;DR Fuck you we're gonna do it.
---
Fuck that trend towards over-polishing the shit out of everything. Fun detected moment if I've ever seen one. Just fucking sit on your hands and leave it alone, can't be that hard, can it?
---
If you look at the norn before they kneel they have a icy aura too them, I think this will be a debuff on the map, in season 3 we found that it gets colder the closer we get to Jormag and I think that the raven will help us deal with the cold, if you look at the bubble there is a lack of snow falling inside. So it will likely be a season based mastery with little use outside of those maps.
---
Build templates, poor PR, their announcement of the latest living story 'saga', developers leaving particularly senior developers including the last Anet founder, Mike O'Brien.
---
Good God. †
---
Meh. I mean, I'm sure that by itself it's going to be cool and all, but it seems very **very** map-specific... And it looks to be basically a prompt (that may or may not change players' skills or special action key). Nothing inovative at first glance. 
---
That's another mastery with an extremely limited use outside the Shiverpeaks, a bit like that weird one from Siren's Landing (what was it again?).
---
In gw1 you could use ability from the [spirits of the wilds](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ursan_Blessing). [The norn didn't always worship the spirits of the wild](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Thrulnn_the_Lost), after the age of giants ended and their magic was taken they turned to spirits of the wild for help and that is when they started to worship them. So the spirits could reasonably bestow abilities to anyone, in this case it looks to be you are communing with the spirits for a blessing to help with the harsh environment.
---
anet,only company which balances thru removing shit from the game. ofc non of this was tested in any mode by anyone and its purely made up by one person. k
---
That’s awesome OP!! I’ll be honest... I had no idea GW2 was still up and running. Going to have to fire it back up this weekend.
---
Well it technically is utility, as it speeds up everything
---
Blizzard wants to have a word with you.
---
Still a terrible change, and they don't even address PvE usefulness concerns in this follow-up.
---
&gt; Right now we think the only one that really needs [falling damage reduction] is Griffonrook Run
---
Falling damage reduction is useful for just playing the game: it's quality-of-life; whether you're exploring, in a jumping puzzle, or attempting a cool trick in a gliding/mount-restricted area.
---
For example, jumping straight down from the chest in the fractal lobby jumping puzzle kills my warrior if I don't have falling damage reduction traited. Is this a huge deal? No. Is it fun to tank that fall? Yes.
---
And what about warrior's fall CC? This was useful for both Amala and the ice elemental boss. It's not confusing; it's a creative application for an otherwise niche skill, and leaving it in allows players to discover useful tricks for challenging situations. Replacing it with a homogeneous damage buff is straight-up *boring*.
---
So, you're saying that if I go to the Warframe subreddit, I'm not going to be greeted with a shitstorm of bitching about how bad the developer is?
---
Use more dyes
---
That offer ran in Europe too. I have a Google Home Mini in my kitchen right now because of it.
---
you have never played any online game i see
---
Every game is great for people who have no idea how badly they're about to be fucked.
---
I thought this was cool and all but it is in no way viable for mid to late game WoW
---
I'm not surprised, but I created this quick and handy chart for the time it takes for various different Game Devs to do things!
---
_____________
---
Time format for Game Developers
---
**Epic Games:** 3 Months
---
**Activision Blizzard:** 2 Years
---
**Arenanet:** 10 Years
---
**Valve:** ∞
---
Thats a hard no for me
---
Hey I'm in Louisville!! 
---
 That's awesome 
---
There's one near fourth St I was going to hit up but good to know new Albany has some!
---
Myth: "Set aside some time, It'll take 10+ attempts to learn how to kill a boss."
---
Reality: "Spend an hour forming a group, group disbands after two wipes."
---
No i am thinking that there are over 5300 skins were some of them looking amazing and you do not have to get gemstore skins to be  the special snowflake. You can be without spending a single penny on it. 
---
You might want a special skin and that is fine, but you do not need it to be able to make a good look as the post suggested that other game did but GW2 do not. 5300 skins that are not gem store skins should be enough for anyone.
---
Ep 2 was in response to Primordus becoming active and moving under the fire island chain.
---
 Ep 3 was to investigate Jormag and it's activity in the shiverpeaks and obtain samples of a vine touched icebrood.
---
Ep 4 is the white mantle attack on DR
---
Ep 5 was us chasing Balthazar to Primordus
---
Ep 6 was us working with the white mantle to not only defeat lazurus but also to pursue the eye of janthir to wherever Balthazar went since he had one of lazurus' spects.
---
I honestly do not recall ep 1
---
I never said you wouldn't. It's totally full of bitching. I was comparing the response of the companies.
---
Hello! Individual keybind for every mount guy here. I wouldn't want to trade it for a slower radial ever but you do you! Giving the game a radial probably wouldn't mean taking away my keybinds, so in the end we could both be happy. yay
---
Are you high bro? That's fucking huge for PvP aswell as a lot of others.   
---
Clone and vortex for ALL druid specs WITHOUT them being pvp talens? Ay fucking lmao
---
Necromancer minions were a more important part of the class' kit in Guild Wars 1, and that game included a special menu where you could view their health bars when playing as a Necromancer.  That game also offered several skills devoted to recovering their health, though, along with targeted spells that would cause dead minions to explode for damage (GW2 has that as well, but it's an automatic effect... the GW1 Necromancers could also cast that spell on players or enemies to make them explode on dying too).  You also needed corpses to generate minions in the first place, outside of one particular elite skill.  No dead enemies (or allies) nearby, no minions...
---
There's just not a lot of reason in GW2 to need to see the health bars of your disposable minions.  Rangers get to see their pet's health, but Necromancers get no special tools for their minions, or Engineers for their turrets, or Renegades for their warband members, or Thieves for their Thieves' Guild, or Elementalists for their elementals.
---
Good points. I like having to use everything in my kit to overcome challenges.
---
Shut up and give me Bear!
---
People who play DPS on m0 probably
---
It has been stated by Arenanet the developers that typical "minion mancer" style gameplay is too passive and will not be implemented in GW2. As such minions are underpowered and designed to be used more for their activation skills which does kill the minion.
---
What does the endurance bar represent in wow? Or is it just for show. I'd use it for mana tbh
---
\&gt; Arenanet has not yet figured out how to manage their availability and acquisition. 
---
You make one available with every major content release and you sell them for gems.
---
Maybe I'm not understanding what you're trying to say but it seems pretty obvious???
---
Would agree on most of them, but [Spectral Aid](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spectral_Aid) is a game changer.
---
*Especially* on Necro.
---
Which masteries are you missing? Can only see gliding being used tbh, not many mushrooms out in the shiverpeaks lol
---
If people can't stand the templates, just don't use it, don't buy it, or just quit the game, bitching, crying, whining about it all months-long in this subreddit won't help anything at all. 
---
With only $30, you get the full gw2 games without the monthly subscription, ability to buy gem with golds. The minimum amount you have to spend is $30, and the rest you can basically unlock with in-game golds. and with the laid-off 130 out of 400, Mike O'Brien left, a bunch of changes in Anet, you expect all this to be fixed and improved in this short amount of time? LOL
---
"the positivity will come back instantly.", LOL
---
90% of the content in this sub is all about whining even before the template is released, and mehhh, I don't expect any positivity will ever come out from this sub. Too much cry babies.
---
For open world it just comes down to your preferences. If you find longbow fun then go for it. If you wanna kill things fast, have good cleave and be effective it's just not a good weapon. If you just wanna play ranged then the shortbow with a condition based build is way better at everything than lb.
---
For fractals longbow offers nothing,zip, it doesnt help with anything, doesnt contribute anything, dps is painfully low, no cleave.....you get the point.
---
I'm not much of a PvP player so ill leave this to more experienced players. The downvotes are really stupid, yes :(.
---
Might be run by the same district manager. Worth a check. If the codes aren't there, come on to the other side of the river.
---
This is a common misunderstanding. I don't know why.  The wiki is pretty clear about it.
---
You forgot the jumping mushrooms in Bitterfrost Frontier at the bases of the giant trees?
---
Not sure if sarcastic disagreement or genuine agreement.
---
Regardless, shitting on players who genuinely enjoy the game is just plain toxic. I want the game to be better and encourage veterans to continue sending out their message because the build templates are, in fact, a major screw up on their end on top of WvW and PvP but punishing new players and people who are happy just being their artsy self goes against one of the things that makes this game stand out - the community coming together and helping one another like decent human beings.
---
I get people are really upset but there are better ways to handle it than this.
---
I've had this bug a few times on mesmer. If you close and reopen the console it usually fixes itself.
---
You can also land on one of those pillars and cloths next to it. Those ledges should be elevated enough to be non-fatal, even without the trait.
---
You are basically talking about groups that phase in 2-3 seconds so its better to precast lb 5, start in sword/axe and quickly use rapid fire b4 the phase ends for slightly higher burst . This offers more burst than switching to gs or keep autoattacking on sword/dagger etc. But in most occasions and especially on normal tier 4s this just doesnt work as most bosses dont have small burst phases but rather one big phase until they die.
---
Whats the link to where you got it from?
---
They localised the game for three European languages (four if you would consider English)... The support covers even more... 
---
Saying they are just working for the US market.... Pffft...
---
I suppose we just don't have any crappy franchises they can use here... Too much quality!
---
I bought LW2 recently and did it, it brings barely nothing tbh.
---
This is a solution but not having the fall damage traits has little impact on wvw tbh. Most areas where you could take advantage of the trait already have ways to jump down quickly that don't require it assuming it's not in your territory and you can't just glide.
---
That buff to Signet of Undeath's passive Life Force generation is pretty huge though, and completely unrelated to the goal of this patch. I'll take it for sure, it'll be amazing for Shroud necro/reaper builds. By itself (with the Signets of Suffering trait, but no other Life Force boosting traits), it'll cancel out two-thirds of Death Shroud's Life Force depletion, and two-fifths of Reaper Shroud's. This may make Valkyreaper worth looking into again, since they'll be able to stay in Shroud much longer.
---
&gt; As such minions are underpowered and designed to be used more for their activation skills which does kill the minion.
---
No it doesn't. But I forgive you for not knowing since you're a Mesmer.
---
Joking aside, actually, only three minions die when you activate their skill.
---
The Flesh Wurm and the Bone Minions. The former is a teleport and the latter two suicidal bombs.
---
The Blood Fiend is a sacrificial skill for a heal.
---
I don't think the Bone Minions are worth it and the Blood Fiend is better off NOT using the active skill.
---
The other minions do not die. Bone Fiend is a self root that cripples enemies, Shadow Fiend is a teleport strike that grants a decent amount of Life Force, the Flesh Golem is a charge. 
---
Rise!'s Shambling Horrors and the trait Reanimator's Jagged Horrors are all on timers and are basically minions you can drop and forget.
---
But minions aren't underpowered. In fact they're really good in open world. Maybe not in PvP and WvW but for PvE they're perfectly fine. They heal after combat, they take 90% reduced AoE damage, they can tank for you and if you got decent heals you can keep them up indefinitely if they take hits. In fact most Necro builds for group play, either Scourge or Reaper usually takes two minions. Shadow Fiend and the Flesh Golem.
---
And on another note in their favor, if you spec Death Magic, minions will take a condition off of you every few seconds, if you have nothing but minions, that's at the very least 4 conditions every few seconds that are removed from you and then transferred to an enemy. Now if you have Rise! and hit a nice group of mobs, that can be up to 11 condis removed. 12 if you change one utility minion for Bone Minions and you keep them up. 
---
Blood, Shadow, Bone, Flesh and Shambling x 6. 5 for total mobs hit and 1 that is baked into the shout. And that's not counting Jagged Horrors, though it's hard to have a few of those.
---
And the plus toughness from Death Magic synergy which also increases your damage.
---
Yeah, that's my problem with the Mastery System, you spend some time grinding XP to get some abilities you use in one map and never again.
---
Because no one ended up winning it
---
I do hope that they use the spirits of the wild as the new mastery system. And then that we can use them as the gw1 ursan form and so, that they had with the norm title track.  Although the norn have there bear form that the norn get a special extra when they use the form.
---
I wouldn't complain if my infinite repair canister turned into an infinite revive orb.
