There's no point for 40 people to turn around and chase five players: they are a distraction. Your job in a big zerg when you're dealing with a tail-hugging havoc squad is *not to be the tail.*

An adequate person would know the difference between using a custom tool to spectate a big event (harming nobody) and using memory injections to gain gameplay advantage. Nobody is gonna blame a company for banning a player using spectate tool to spy on WvW enemies across the whole map LUL, even if he cries "well you allowed it during a tournament!!!".
---
Fistbump: You
---
Spoilers! Not everyone has Epi 3
---
Oh, he read something and now he think that he can "controll" anything. Cute. ;)
---
sT kind of forgot about the lightning mechanic.
---
No, that's just two servers being sporting, not a pattern of collusion. People want to see the negative twist to everything.1
---
Ofc, but supporting it would’ve lead to maybe double the viewers, gaining more attention to the game from Randoms and more money for anet
---
It's kinda sad when people try to make fun of it, but don't get the allusion.
---
Uhh.. because he has put in insane effort countless times and is the biggest streamer pulling off better events and views than what arena net bothers to do. He is one of the only people putting up numbers for this game.
---

---
Putting GW2 in top 20 alone probably made loads of people consider downloading the game.
---
I'm controlling you right now, my monkey
---
*/cringe*
---
that will be shit, like all content lately. don't get hyped so you won't be disappointed.
---
downvotes come.
---
gear?
---
PLZ just stop with all these fucking spam posts
---
remember to spoiler tag :)
---
oh grimJack the best player in the game.... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT   HAHAHA  
---
MAYBE RENAME TO GRIMKACK111ELF
---
Like they would announce to everybody on the server individually that they are doing what they are doing ... LOL
---
Oh god that commentation, more exciting that watching golf. :D
---
That is again exactly the joke
---
A six second difference in a 31 minute race is insanely tight.
---
After all the talk about how [LN] might be cracking under the pressure, one little mistake by [sT] at the very end proved to be the difference.
---
When I looked
---
GW2 total viewers: 16.4K
---
MT viewers: 15.9K
---
I don't think Anet realizes how much they're losing (as far as publicity), and that it could have been avoided if they had just listened to the players. Everything he cited for his reason for leaving have been issues for years
---
Who said they're not already there and that_shaman just is keeping that spoiler to himself. He doesn't reveal everything :)
---
What about playable Canthans?
---
Other game publisherd pay thousands of dollars to streamers to promote their games, they wouldnt do that if it didnt work.
---
you need to understand how big this event was and how much of this sub represents the end game community. This was huge and it's only fair Teapot gets recognition. After all he's done he deserves it.
---
Competitive TF2 Community: First time?
---
Wow, downvotes for a legitimate question? I forgot how toxic Reddit is. Kinda thought this community was better than that.
---
One of the teams won the event by 6 seconds turning the tables like 20 seconds before the end of the fight.
---
I think that devs just should deliver good game that is good playfield, and then it is people who should create their events and do big stuff in it.
---
Hell of an end to a hell of an event. 
---
For those wondering Teapot did confirm he is "taking a break" from the game and joking said he will prob be back. He is doing his last stream tomorrow @6PM England time. Hopefully everyone can come by for some laughs, tears and memes.
---
One more post to report. I wonder if you know what I make you do. But I guess you don't. ;)
---
I mean, if you aren't playing the game anymore, you're no longer part of the hardcore community?
---
dance for me my monkey, dance, dance!
---
This won't end well for you, you know?
---
Not as tight as Roy's leggins.
---
Yeah, let's go back to complaining about not having content.  
---
Fuck this.  I've never played Wow before in my life, but if people who are willing to build this much for their games are moving over to it, I am too.  I'd rather play a old, outdated game and have fun.
---
&gt; The GW2 community has finally come together in it's best light and such amazing support.
---
By spamming the chat with "GW2 is dead", links to FFXIV, and bashing Anet for not supporting the event. Lol.
---
Are you claiming that any GW2 stream actually had 170k viewers? 
---
Well i guess you learn something every day.
---
DPS meters aren't toxic. It helps players understand the game and improve as well as providing accountability and responsibility to players.
---
Imagine Shaman and ANet being in cahoots and misleading everyone before the actual Cantha reveal.
---
Invest in Reynold's wrap here, tinfoil hat.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
No, absolutely there's no collusion or agreements. The commanders on BG barely even communicate with each other anymore, so it's a bit hard to have a server-wide agreement.
---
Pretty much every server thinks they're getting double-teamed. In fact, on the rare occasions that it's happening, it's BG that gets the short end.
---
I mean, I warned you multiple times.
---
I had to run the entire meta quite a few times for collections and crystalline ore so I really can’t remember at which specific step I got the trophy
---
And it’s hard to say because it could be either the entrance door, as you say, or the exit door from the blighting trees to Heart of Thorns tree that opens after all three commanders are dead
---
This is so true and so sad at the same time :(  
---
 Guild Wars 2 has so much wasted potential, it's really a shame...
---
With all the shit talk about the game as of late, it really is heartwarming to see some positivity for once you know? I'm so glad the ERP was a big hit and I have the feeling that things will only get better from here after seeing what the community is capable of.
---
This is mental. They could not even give away gems.
---
Nah, I’ll buy Largos from QQ
---
Don't worry, anet won't do anything to promote the raiding community on twitch. It's a small community ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yes, I encourage you to watch the chat. But watch the full VoD, not just this clip.
---
Especially the comments about Anet.... :-P 
---
(Spoiler alert: Not do positive lol)
---
I hate to be the one to say it, but all the innovation came from GW1.  Most GW2's innovation was lifted from other MMO's.
---
You really shouldn't do that.
---
They should stop partnering with bubble tea and start putting things on twitch prime loot.
---
He did go to them and ask for it but they said no
---
Please do not remove the thread this time, as I am not breaking any rules. This thread is not to stir up drama. :)
---
Oh chat was absolutely aids. Like, far more aids than normal. But that also made it more fun in some ways.
---
That’s a stupid reason tbqh. No one could pretend they didn’t know that using it for broadcasting a tournament is different from using it for personal advantage in pvp or whatever.
---
No, part of the reason pof got so little hype compare to hot was the leaks
---
Have you seen the quality difference between the tool use and stream of a player???
---
&gt;Who is mightyteapot?
---
Oh, I don't know. He organized the largest event ever in GW2 history? View counts exceeding the highest amounts ever on a Gw2 stream, exceeding even the expansion reveals? 
---
Oh, and he makes raid guides too.
---
Yeah, that guy.
---
I've never seen ERP with relation to GW2 before, so I was genuinely confused at first.  
---
Been playing since right after launch on and off, but never have done raids.
---
Nobody in this tournament will probably ever login again anyway.
---
whats wrong with that? are people not allowed to express their discontent about anet?
---
EvE-Online is super "casual" game with full loot PvP... 16 years, 3 game engine overhauls, expansions every year, all with sub fee.
---
Games for invested players exists.
---
You got baited.
---
You only hurt yourself, you know?
---
&gt;The problem is that GW2 is great to play but terrible to watch.
---
17k people watched the ERP3.
---
All the Key, Pen and Clock memes born today made it one of the funniest twitch chat experience of all time.
---
Last fire int by sT, confirmed paid actor.
---
Apparently the best update to the game! Well, debatably. What kind of mounts would it add?
---
where are the one who saying gw2 is shit to watch? cluster this cluester that
---
lmfao, see that for yourself, its all about advertisement and who the one playing it, and teapot can do that and thats the result 12k+ viewers
---
LS?
---
This event was a last hurrah for many in the raid community before they all leave.
---
&gt; LV 35 - 45. Harathi Hinterlands: My personal favourite, so much free exp here. Kill everything once again, and roam around the northeast Centaur area, there are a lot of neutral mobs there that are not killed. If you're using a good aoe class, you should be able to lure about 10 of them and kill them all. 
---
Yea I use the same method. Don't forget the underwater mobs too. There are a tonne and no one kills them if you know what you're doing it's a big xp boost.
---
I think parts are true certainly. Elite specs are likely I'd say 50 to 80% likely, mount revisions I don't see happening maybe a radial mount thing like the add on but mounts are pretty solid. I mean everything minus the gem store stuff and the races are likely. Giving us new races that start at level 80 I don't like.
---
It's not Reddit on this particular post, it's teapot community. He will leave to WoW Vanilla.
---
What do you mean? What camera tool?
---
It doesn't matter what the amount is as long as its 'a lot' and the community raises it together
---
&gt; The baker seems to have completely destroyed any trace of cupcakes with sprinkles and prefers to just make muffins with blueberries and raisins
---
I don't get this part.
---
I will wait until the 30th to decide if I leave the game, but my bags are already packed.
---
Thats what you get. An event fully supported by the community, not even a word from Anet .. it just pushes the buttons .. 
---
The event consisted of only 6 guilds because there were not enough guilds active to make it to 8 .. it shows the decaying state of the game mode when there clearly is an interest. 
---
Instead, all the focus is going into LW .. where casuals plays 3 hours a month and leave. If that does not make one go sour and hateful towards the game, I don't know what will. 
---
We all understand ultimately its about the money, and if Anet thinks they are better off feeding the casuals that don't give any relevance towards the game, then thats fine. 
---
Truth is that this community driven event was the best single piece of advertisement this game had in 4 years .. let that sink in for a second.
---
Don't do that. Don't give me hope.
---
Everything about the event can be used as argument.
---
Well, ArenaNet created the content we are celebrating today in the first place so they shouldn't be ashamed i guess. It is true however that they seem to be crazy out of touch or are straight up ignoring what their core community wants. I really hope they will announce some big things for us hardcore players in a few days because if all they will present to us is living story till the end of days then my favorite franchise is gonna die right there.
---
Don't get me wrong, I agree it's stupid that ArenaNet didn't support this, let alone even send a heads-up tweet that it's happening. The chat was still also spamming "dead game" and telling people to play WoW or FFXIV. Hardly a "best light".
---
&gt; that any other game would KILL to have
---
Hm, I wonder why after all these years I'm still with GW2 and not *that any other game*. Maybe there's a correlation.
---
&gt; or maybe they don‘t want to put in that much effort... for whatever reason.
---
I guarantee you, speaking to individual devs, they are extremely passionate and have a large vision of scope.
---
But for whatever business reasons, a lot goes unreleased or unfinished.
---
My 2 cents: Blame upper management and NCSoft.
---
Aurene eating joko wasn’t a plot twist though, saw it coming from miles away
---
Aren't people who compete in Arena tournys forced to use no addons? Pretty sure that was the case.
---
You can use camera hacks, arc dps, taco or whatever you want on livestreams - The issue is Arenanet providing a prize pool for a tournament using someone elses software.
---
Also in WoW mods are encouraged, Gw2 doesn't really have good mod support and leaves it mostly as a grey area.
---
on the other side, defending anet will not give you any profit and will not make them change a single bit on whatever they do. so where is the point being against the community.  
---
back in the days we had 10k+ players in 50+ districts, people working together to make a change. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNY6Bm0sdIA  
---
today anet gets defended to the last blood out of fear that your own gamemode won't see any updates anymore. you simply can't deny that most points people make are valid.
---
It's amazing how many posts you're able to make trying to bash the biggest community event this game ever had while proving yourself a clown each single time.
---
I don't think shitting all over ANET benefits anyone.
---
I do think they can learn a ton from this. The event single handedly became the biggest thing the game has seen in  a very long time.
---
The future is mobile. Don't you guys have phones?
---
Wildstar was a complete cluster of fuck of poor decision making and poor development. You seem to be totally misguided as to what exactly killed wildstar so I recommend you this vid:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru0dXDz9qoY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru0dXDz9qoY) 
---
No one is saying Gw2 should go full hardcore content, but sPvP WvWvW and Raids, 3 game modes that can form communities and pull people in (as shown in this tournament) are being neglected to a severe extent.
---
comments are lit. enjoy it while they are there, tmr some mod will go over it.
---
&gt; After seeing ERP and Teapot/Jawgeous among others leaving the game, Arenanet has been silent and it's kinda deafening, it's almost like they've put their hardcore community on mute, and it shows.
---
Wait, do you really expect that Anet start any reveal or announcement because of an inofficial community event? Sorry, but that's naiv. 
---
Anet set a date for their next announcement (30. August) long time ago. They also talked about the "radio silent" from before the announcement. If people listen, there is no silence at all.
---
you're asking about someone who's really famous in the community
---
ofc you gonna get downvoted, dont be salty now
---
The credit video was extremely well done. With teapot and supporters leaving the overall IQ of the GW2 community is dropping by 50%.
---
They don't have to but there's no reason not to. It's literally free PR. The silence also sends a message that Anet doesn't care.
---
What do you mean? World comp in 7 years ^(/s)
---
Do what?? You're making no sense.
---
Yeah. To be fair, I do see big squads from all three servers, but as you move into the off-hours the differences in server pop become a lot more apparent. Moving to another battleground helps imo, even BG squads have to shuffle around when things get too hot. EBG is usually always pretty arglebargle but if you want smaller groups for a while, just hit the other ones.
---
LOL
---
Y'all need to let it go. They ain't changing.
---
(I missed the whole thing while traveling - how can I catch up on what happened?)
---
Are you sure you're not playing more Reddit than you do play GW2?
---
They're not wrong? There hasn't been any GW2 content worth watching in years.
---
Don't share the emblem..... share the roster instead and let's see how many people there are still playing in your guilds. :(
---
I don't watch MightyTeapot but I watched parts of the ERP and it was hype. I don't think a streamer that hits like 500 viewers usually can pull 17k viewers out of his ass. I know the WvW community was cheering him on, and I'm sure many other people who aren't invested in the whole Twitch thing also tuned in to see what this Tournament with a $5000 + 300,000 gold prize pool (a Chak Egg sac as well!) could produce.
---
Overwatch Leage Season 4 - presented by xQc, JJonak and Seagull.
---
There were 17k viewers at one point. 7 or 8 posts on reddit is pretty bleak if you ask me. It'll probably blow over by tomorrow though.
---
I want this purely for pets for *everyone* and pet skins cause I have dreamed of pet skins for forever. :'| Give me my Elonian Scaled Drake gdi.
---
they can already consider me gone, I'm going to WoW classic, devs that have already shown a two year plan that seems to actually respect the player's wishes.
---
Of course, but money really is the worst argument ever. It make it sounds like "we gathered much money, and you didn't help us!".
---
Any other argument would be better. Like the views.
---
When your teacher is so good you start to think you are them
---
SNOW THROWS
---
Teapot is a stupid cunt
---
That's what I'm talking about. It has to be "a lot" of money to be an argument.
---
Gathering much money is no argument.
---
Ok, but what rune did the scourge use?
---
Isn't wow literally multiple times more popular than Gw2 (at least during its peak a long time ago) and part of a company that is literally overflowing with money to do whatever they want?
---
You know what arenanet has?
---
Literally only guild wars.
---
Blizzard has like 30 years of multiple games. They've cornered the market really and can do just about whatever they want within reason and profit.
---
Isn't that what you babies are doing?
---
&gt; you simply can't deny that most points people make are valid.
---
All I've seen this week is precisely the reasons why ANet chose the path it did. I'm glad they did it, because they are the rare company that understands that *there exists a market niche into which I fall along with the silent majority of GW2's players*, - so yeap, I'll be showing them support on the platform where, today, our audience is outnumbered by the mighty brigade. But since those're leaving, it doesn't really matter anyway, does it? (:
---
Never said that, but look around. People/fanboys start raging against Anet because they didn't support this event and because they didn't give him extra tools. It's starting to get ridiculous. They even argue with how much money they gathered.
---
why are you on reddit then?
---
Sorry, but no. They already tried with ESL PvP tournaments, and WvW seasons. It didn't work. No regular content of this kind work out for GW2 scene. Once-twice in a year, with approx half of the viewers being viewbots, as reported by api? That's the most we could expect.
---
&gt; but(t)
---
Most players don't even have Guild Defender set that is not obtainable anymore. Raiders are just salty for being casuals.
---
The impact that Teapot will leave via his exit is ten-fold whatever mine is/would be. I think both of us aren't done *for good*, but most definitely there's not sufficient reasoning to remain, recycling the same things hoping for change. Teapot has endured this much longer than I have, and in many different forms. My biggest issue is the lack of support towards PvP / WvW to enable excitement and growth - Which also is something Teapot feels strongly about. Now pair that with less replayable content in PvE and a one-episode per 3 month schedule. The LW Map dies within weeks and then we're back to the content drought.
---
Teapot feels the hit in all forms. 
---
I feel the hit in the PvP form. 
---
If ArenaNet chose to move away from this ridiculous release cadence and actually brought life back to the dying game-modes, they *could* see a strong return in player engagement. The implication is that they are merely following a safe path, no risk, easy reward(s) but one that results in a slow eventual death as people bleed out.
---
I know for one that I would return quite happily if I knew that I could rely on a release schedule that benefit me, just as much it would benefit a lore-lover. Sadly, this is an unrealistic expectation and thus I stepped away/back. I think Teapot feels the same way, but I wouldn't want to put words in his mouth.
---
It's a true shame, especially after what tonight has taught us.
---
Since when is the raiding community their "core community"?
---
I expect a statement when a community event blows any of their announcements or streams out of the water.
---
It's not naive to think they should acknowledge a massive community accomplishment.
---
Nobody is expecting any teases or reveals before the announcement, they just want to know if everything is gonna be okay, because all signs point to it's not going to be right now.
---
While it isn’t impossible it is without a doubt the biggest drag I’ve ever seen. This is coming from someone who has two legendaries(Incinerator, chuka and champawat) and I have an easier time crafting those two compared to fractal 100CM or raiding. I’ve been 3 raiding guilds, I’ve pugged, I’ve joined fractals groups and even though some attempts were a success, there were so many other that were downright horrible. The goal of it all is to aquire those sweet KP’s that are in high demand in LFG, but realistically it will take me weeks or even month to get in with the bare minimum of KP’s. 
---
I see people with legendary gear and celestial/red infusions walking around and I keep getting the urge to give it ”one more try”, but the sucess rate is a joke. The hardcore players are too far away from my reach and I’ll struggle for a long time reaching them. It doesn’t matter how many times I rewatch a raid video or read up on Arkk, I’ll be stuck there. Not forever, but too long for me. I’d rather grind my third legendary weapon than to touch either of those endgames again.
---
[removed]
---
So you have like, what, thousands of hours into the game?  No game lasts forever.  Stop being a whiny jackass about the cake.  You've eaten the cake.  Find another baker.  Stop threatening the baker of the cake you've eaten.  Plenty of people have not tried the cake, or eaten all of the cake.
---
because i am still raiding on mondays and always have the little hope that anet wakes up at some point. may as well be nostalgia since i am with the franchise since gw1 released.
---
The event was 9 hours each of two weekend days, not something any sane person would commit to once a month, not counting planning and production
---
They forgot the second team at least 1/3 of the time. Let's just say it was good.
---
gachiBASS
---
I think streamers should help the game grow and not hurt it via drama or to gain attention and return to leech the game once more. The game is to be played not to give you money. If you entertain others in a game you should be helping the game win more. What I seen in this event is the opposite and an attempt to kill the game (specially by saying that you are leaving to other game) or to harm it's image, spiting on the Devs is just wrong I'm sure they want the best to the game more than this event organizers. This is not critiques at this point, it's pure bizzare hate.
---
They didn't even retweet the ERP announcement or the stream...
---
All of their twitter the past week is Art, their own streams and Gemstore promotions...
---
Priorities I guess...
---
You can rewatch the whole broadcast in video format on MightyTeapot's twitch channel.
---
Because you play GW2 and go to GW2 related sites. Ads are based heavily on your search history and preferences.
---
&gt; They did gather a lot of money and it was an endeavor that players themselves made happen. That's the whole point: everything about the event including the insane amount of views was player driven.
---
And yet you think arguing with the gathered money is the right way to "criticize" that Anet didn't gave special rights/tools to the organizer? 
---
&gt; How many viewers were there for PoF announcement?
---
Okay, I was wrong. **This** is the worst argument ever...
---
I would cry of joy - my main is sort of steampunky so this would be perfect for her.
---
Yes,  this is why I had been stockpiling gems the last 6 months or so.
---
Oh ok, thanks for the update! :)
---
mightyteapot has the whole tournament saved on his twitch channel, so you can rewatch it there, and there will probably be youtube videos in the next few days too
---
But... ERP was only about raiding and topic of this thread is ERP..
---
There’s a bakery I’ve been waiting to try, it’s called Black Desserts. I’ve spent a lot of money on this bakery but I feel as though It’s time to move on
---
No giveaways
---
i realised that :D
---
He doesn't appreciate skill, cause he doesn't have any. So he whines and complains.
---
the guy who got hit was Lil Esmeralda, literally cost them the win.
---
You're quoting the wrong dude, I didn't speak about money.
---
&gt;"Support us, he got more views than you"
---
I don't know if that's true, I want to know, hence why I asked since you look like the type of person to know
---
Not lowkey begging stop high key assuming maybe??
---
GW2 has a face, jessica price is a perfect fit :^)
---
And you see, without people having eaten the cake in the first place, this baker wouldn't have made any profits or known if their cake was even good in the first place, go back to your moms basement.
---
Everyone will want to go to a baker if they hear they're good at baking.
---
ty
---
Are you serious? What the fuck did they do the last 3-4 years streaming everyday? They didn't promote the game or help it grow? What the actual fuck.
---
Guess you did not read my disclosure ...
---
You asked the exact same thing in discord though
---
So my thing is who’s fault is it that ArenaNet didn’t do anything with ERP? Was is it the whole company or just the marketing team? It’s very sad that they didn’t do anything with the ERP! IMO I believe it was the marketing team! There are 12 people who work for marketing! I just got my info from the wiki. :p https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/ArenaNet
---
At this point, most people feel like shitting all over arena-net because all other methods of trying to get them to pull their heads out from their behinds have been exhausted and there is zero hope of anything ever changing.
---
It's possible to twist this retarded analogy of yours in many different ways.  How about this:
---
You have thousands of hours in this game.  You're bored with the game.  Find a new game, stop bothering people who like the game, and for God's sake, stop threatening the baker with horror stories about how you have no idea who to find another game to play.
---
No dedicated guild team still hurts my soul :(
---
I'll actually join pessimism if they don't bring anything worthwhile with the 30th announcement.
---
Well fair enough, she’s just appears randomly to either sell me an expansion or to show a new mount.
---
I want a proper « What we’re doing, what we’ll do + Q&amp;A » rendezvous like devstreams for Warframe.
---
It may be once every two weeks or once a month but I want communication damn it!
---
Yeah your point? why ask discord with less people that dont know and didnt give a direct answer.
---
It took over 2 months just to organize this one
---
He got you there though. xD
---
If you wanna know my personal opinion: no, I don't think they will try to extract valuable information from this.
---
Their streams are very lacking and they should know it, their way of handling this and many previous marketing pitfalls hasn't been good either.
---
I want the game to do better but I also have the baggage of previous experiences.
---
Anet is who?
---
I don't hate meta-builds so much as I hate the min-maxing mindset in raids in general (all games, not just GW2). I'm not saying raids should be faceroll city, but I do think it should be more about clearing a reasonably set bar and less about being The Best (lets leave the epeen measuring to the PVPers?) - raids as this exclusive top-tier content reserved only for the elite is an old mindset I still see too much of and it definitely doesn't belong in GW2. It should require more gear, prep and knowledge of your class than open world or fractals, sure, but the rotation and meta builds stuff is just a good way of sucking the fun out of the game. 
---
Not sure if the current climate is a symptom of a badly designed raid system or the ingrained mentality of raiders from other games (cough-WoW-cough), but either way I'd love to see a system where raids maybe are gated by a test of skill: like you do a personal story type mission where you either heal or dps with NPCs on a level that would be required by raids - including dealing with similar mechanics - and then if you pass you're ready for raids. That way you also can't be carried into raid qualification, which is possible in the current system of showing various "kill proof" in order to prove you're capable of raiding when pugging.
---
The fuck are you talking about? Look at dota 2 tournaments.
---
I'm not responsible for the tone you attribute to my post. It was not meant to be condescending, nor in my mind did it sound condescending.
---
As for his fame... Again, I'd never heard of him. I'm very rarely on Twitch, as well as rather large percentage of the GW2 community probably. No need for drama here.
---
SAP
---
".....and someone who died comes back as a villain".
---
Trahearne as the new antagonist confirmed LUL
---
Nice one.
---
How is being the best something negative?
---
Ehhhh not so much.  A lot of people were skeptical of the leaks.  I think pof lacked the hype because there was no buildup.  There was announcement,  then 3 months later launch. HoT had tons of reveals and betas and trailers to build hype (which was good because content draughts suck)
---
they couldnt even show aurene fly through the open space window behind joko, now she just had to be teleported right into position. coming in from the side instead of behind him in the frame just made it worse, even though the logic of it was still technically there, since at this point only joko would really be strong enough to stop her flying around, if at all. it was a great twist but poorly executed in terms of set up
---
If you’ve seen the video, you’ll notice that the camera goes in all sorts of directions, like the person running the camera is in spectator mode for any good pvp match or other MMO spectator mode. GW2 doesn’t currently have any way of doing that with the camera in raids. In essence, there’s no good way to spectate GW2 raids. Someone developed a camera tool that did all that, but it’s essentially hacking the game. ANet can’t condone this, but if they buy the tool from the developer and implement it into their game they could reasonably endorse, sponsor, and promote the game their making
---
I play 2 characters (one pve and wvw, one spvp). And I'm not saying there is NO repeatable content,  just that it's a side focus.  The snails pace for fractal/raid releases confirms that.
---
Just started the PoF storyline,hope you die after horrible sufferings
---
Hey sorry to ask MightyTeapot but could you please put up the logs somehow for the tournament on August 24th as well/ (the day it first started?) The most recent logs are up on your website, but not the previous ones and I'm just curious about the some of the logs for the bosses. Apologies for any troubles.
---
Sorry to say but unless you get ultra lucky and join an active group that does end-game content and not only doesn't mind a few new apples but welcomes them. That is the grind you are gonna have to do, i know that's what i did for raids, and currently doing for Fractal CMs.
---
Nevermore is a cool staff, best of luck.
---
I’d also like for you to draw one for me :)
---
I’ll keep searching, you too bud.
---
That's not a high bar to clear... that "twist" was stupid with Aurene.
---
Everyone in the gw2 marketing dept should be fired over this. Teapot just gave them tens of thousands in marketing and they were nowhere to be seen.
---
They are terrible at their jobs to not have given erp money, paid teapot to stay around, or develop a community over the years. It is hard to describe just how valuable the marketing teapot did with erp. They decisions they made show they are absolutely incapable of running their business effectively.
---
&gt; "Oh? It's still going? I thought it died.".
---
Every time I hear someone say this I have to assume they don't have a brain. Just because *you* don't keep up with something doesn't mean it died. I hear people throw this out for so many things, not just GW2.
---
Yeah, when I first started seeing posts about it, I thought it was just a bunch of weirdos broadcasting their erotic roleplay, why anybody would be hyped about that was completely beyond me. I figured I was just out of touch, getting old and all.
---
I don't see what the point of pulling punches when Friday is going to make or break my future with GW2.
---
People wouldn't turn to 3rd party tools if ArenaNet was willing to get their shit together and meet people halfway.  
---
ArenaNet wants people to think of themselves as the "Nintendo" of MMORPGs yet this seems so petty and spiteful.  Organizing a community tournament that draws in 15,000 to 17,500 viewers without official support?  ArenaNet's Twitter account has 320,000 followers; meaning if even 5% of that base checked out the stream it'd see a **100%** bump in population draw ~ 16,000.
---
The innovators were the GW1 guys that stayed on thru GW2's development. When those folks left, and it's not that hard to guess when they did, GW2's innovation came to crashing halt. The game has done nothing good or new from a fundamental design standpoint since 2012.
---
It did come off as condescending. But yeah, he's pretty famous on twitch and to an extent YouTube. It seems like only people who are really into PvP, WP or Twitch really know about him.
---
Assnet is trash.
---
Yeah...some players are just walking enigmas. Bend to our will or you shall feel our wrath!
---
Well you don't know that cause Anet hasn't done anything aside from shoving low effort gemstore skins down out our throats. People like teapot have been around for so long promoting the game in so many ways out of pure love for the game. Is it too much to ask for a little support and recognition?
---
Like dropping a packet of sugar into the Atlantic you can never sweeten the fundamentally salty.
---
Because it highlights the biggest issue with the game. It's fucking unwatchable. It would have had less appeal if they couldn't actually make it look presentable and would have very likely had a lower turn out even with Anet's backing.
---
Except they won't learn. Its not like this event has been the first time this has happened. Years ago GvG broadcasts used to do the same thing, get much larger audiences than GW2 usually got and Anet didn't change.
---
Despite people saying the game is dying, it’s hard for me to agree. The last ERP peaked at 5k viewers, and this one more than tripled that. 
---
Whatever anyone says, players are still interested in the game and I hope we have a lot of more events like this.
---
&gt;Oh chat was absolutely aids. Like, far more aids than normal
---
im writing my thesis this upcoming semester about virtual communities and im gonna present twitch chat as the most toxic substance on earth
---
What happened?
---
Can finally quit this game in peace.
---
Then straight up go and say "give me free shit". Am I really a prick for calling things what they are?
---
That's so sad
---
Pretty sure they did it to get rid of rubber banding. Everyone knows how horrible that was in GW1. Also look at stuff like how people complained server-side gliding and mounts was a horrible experience so they made it client-side.
---
Respect the players wishes? You do know it's Blizzard right? It'll be better than ArenaNet but not by much. Blizzard doesn't even care about the community anymore. I'm still playing WOW classic but not expecting much from it from, it's just a nice quick cash grab for Blizzard but it should be fun to play with friends for the first 4-6 months.
---
How could you forget [this masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk717LQnpVE)!
---
Genuinely curious. How was he able to publicly stream using the camera hacking tool, and wasn't banned?
---
Seems like if anet were to allow 3rd party software for camera use it would only benefit the game. It's not a hack that gives the player an edge, it can and would be used to create media for the game. Terms &gt; Logic
---
If the marketing department wasnt terrible they would help. This is literally their job.
---
Given that they didn't support the event when it was happening, adding a token memorial for it would quite literally be a token gesture. I mean talk about day late and a dollar short, this would be horribly poorly received across all levels of the community.
---
You absolutely are salty because I merely stated an opinion to the OP that this game is not ideal for them because it is a fact that gw2 takes much longer than other mainstream MMOs to release content, all of which is very low difficulty and low replayability, and you got your asscheeks red with anger over them.
---
I mean it should be very fucking obvious by now that when I said "2 hours of content" it was an exaggeration, I even said that in my last post yet you are still going on and on about it like a broken record. So who's the one without a point again? Me, the one who already articulated my claim in my very first post, or you who is flinging shit over to me for literally no other reason than feeling uptight about someone criticising something that you like?
---
&gt; However there is some hate towards Anet and the way they are being criticized that is wrong. Anet has probably the best business model there is for a MMO and that is often being thrown away.
---
In terms of funding the game to allow Anet to produce a reasonable amount of content at a reasonable pace, its clearly not the best.
---
Yeah yeah, Teapot the marketing master, he should lead the whole company after ERP, got it you can go.
---
game needs a sequel after they wrap up the elder dragon story.
---
it was built to be something different and it needs to be totally redesigned.
---
People keep talking about how Anet should be ashamed for not being supportive, and they keep blaming it on them not wanting to support the use of a freecam hack, but just look at the acronym (ERP, really? What genius decided that using an acronym more widely known as “erotic roleplay” was the way to get Anet’s support?) and then as if that weren’t bad enough, look at the participants’ names. Holy shit. I wouldn’t want to be publicly associated with that either man.
---
Didn't spam it on r/gaming once on r/games and once on r/gaming o/
---
No downstate would be a great addition to real raids (for perhaps bonus loot or a unique skin/reward).
---
oh boy...
---
Real talk? I think ArenaNet just hates competition.
---
Fanboys also busy at downvoting tonight.
---
Raids are already too easy. The CMs are like the normal mode lol
---
When I got into the early release, I picked Yak's Bend for my server. I have a large interest recently in WvW. Yak's Bend is [last place](http://gw2stats.com/na/matchups/) in the last tier. What am I supposed to do? Actual leaders in WvW are barely ever on. What am I supposed to do, ANet? Please tell me. I can't transfer to Blackgate who seems to be the only WvW exclusive server. Why am I in this situation? What did I do wrong? Why is this an issue? I am on a break from the game because I am lost. I have multiple characters fully geared from WvW with no one to run with other than brief times my guild is on. Even people who do follow the tags are there for a few dailies then leave. I am really at a loss.
---
Quick UPDATE: I've messaged mods at /r/Games and /r/Gaming for the post to be available going sort any issue and let this link be live :) ! stay tuned
---
I’m OOTL why is everyone quitting? For WoW classic? Seems odd all these people would be so hardcore and then just dump their main game completely.
---
camera hack
---
You literally blew off 17k impressions. Thats how they price commercials and ads.
---
No but other MMO's have far better camera controls and addon capability. Ontop of also having far better visual clarity and effects culling.
---
^ there was probably around 6-7k legit viewers, the rest were definitely all viewbotted
---
you are a prick for assuming im begging. when i was simply just asking if i was begging i would be directly asking for it.
---
What? Is that a commonly used acronym?
---
&gt; So my points are invalid for beeing in the wrong thread?
---
It's not, but you didn't defined "core community". That lead to misunderstandings. 
---
The thread is about ERP -&gt; raiding event. You talk about Anet ignoring their "core community" -&gt; first thought of course is about the raiding community.
---
So, it is true. That sucks.
---
You mean, ahem, *Exciting* Roleplay.
---
Yeah I was just about to say. Warframe is in a realllly weird place right now. Community wise it's incredibly fractured, there's been a pretty significant content draught, and there are some pretty big "influencers" speaking out about the utter lack of endgame. 
---
The weird part specifically comes from the fractured community. It's almost like a little mini-USA, there's extremely loud and vocal "white knights" so to speak who defend and promote the game to death, attacking anyone who says otherwise, while whenever criticism is given to the game it's incredibly hostile and aggressive about even simple things like UI changes. Not only that but these groups aggragate around different places, for instance the subreddit despises and abhors any mention of a youtuber, while turning around the next day and leveraging the same criticisms said youtuber had. Very tribal, very angry. Lots of pitchforks aimed at others within the community.
---
It's been fascinating to watch lmao. And to add to your list, reaperhunter released a video too. 
---
Tl;Dr Warframe community isn't as great as people say it is, and it's not the best example (it's twitch views relative to it's player pop are also abyssal).
---
That, as well as the connotations of the acronym 'ERP'.
---
People seem to be forgetting this, but ERP is not a marketable acronym for an official business - people would just think it's a joke or that it's weird.
---
as a former pvp player, I get it.
---
ERP 1 was in 2016, and Raids/Fractals have only gotten a lot worse since then. This is the end for 99% of people involved with this tourney.
---
In a game called "Guild" Wars 2, for that matter...
---
90% of gw2 players:
---
 what is this?
---
I blocked them. So I only have their accounts names.
---
But it was a macro and it seems shared between them, since it was a massive wall of text divided into multiple messages sent. There is no way a human could even copy paste different messages so fast. It explained what the event was, links and why it was important and money involved.
---
He’s not scapegoating people who play living world; he’s calling out Anet’s design decisions and priorities (making living world content over most else). If you re-read his statement note nowhere in there is he saying “living world players themselves are the problem” he’s merely parroting/satirizing Anet’s philosophy of “all we need for this game is people playing living world” and pointing out that this is the problem
---
Yeah, it’s actually got a bigger scene than clean roleplay. Clean roleplayers can’t even catch a break from people who are into ERP so a lot of people who used to clean RP don’t do it any more.
---
You had to see the message to begin with, can I see a screenshot?
---
Also important to note pasting a giant block of text and repeating the same message over and over are different things.
---
Damn that’s a rip. I honestly think that this game could’ve been as good as WoW and is better in a lot of aspects. 
---
I already know the PvP scene is neglected which sucks cause PvP in MMOs is my favorite and it’s garbage in WoW as well.
---
The good news is for him that it would be super easy for him to swap directly to BfA if he ends up not finding Classic WoW difficult or interesting enough given that you have to Sub to play Classic WoW
---
Begging
---
Begging for items/currency/game codes is not allowed at all.
---
It's right there on the full rule list.
---
truth. when you are combat locked, inventory locked and bosses are mostly dps golems, that removes a lot of layers of gameplay and micromanagement. 
---
imo the ticking dmg aura is also kinda dumb, nothing is hitting you so why are you getting damaged. if you want to damage players, give reason for it. but they want healers to be a thing even though they marketed gw2 before release as game without healers and tanks
---
&gt; You're quoting the wrong dude, I didn't speak about money.
---
You wrote what I quoted. I know that you didn't write the initial comment that talked about money, but you defended it, that's why I asked if you think arguing with gathered money (the initial argument) is the right way. 
---
&gt;  don't know if that's true, I want to know, hence why I asked since you look like the type of person to know
---
I got that one wrong, I guess. I though it was a rethoric question like "ERP got 15k view, how much hot the PoF announcement". 
---
The youtube announcement has ~390k view, but youtube videos generally have more views than twitch videos or livestreams. HoT announcement had 53k views on twitch. PoF is splittet on twitch, one video had 19k view, another one 7.5k an there are several short videos with a few hunderd views.
---
Wait, I'm out of the loop. What's going on?
---
Good thing im not begging lmao.
---
No the most historic moment in gwe is when roy bent over to pick up the poster he made XD
---
"hey guys is anyone giving things for free?, I'm broke rn"
---
It been approved on /r/Games o/ !
---
Sure, whatever you say.
---
I'd have not downvoted this, except for the last bit which was completely unnecessary. Telling strangers on the internet to grow is, ironically, pretty immature in my opinion.
---
you can already visit eye of the north
---
&gt;copypastes event streams are fine
---
&gt;About Gw2 been posted on /r/Games (feel free to comment if I missed anything).
---
It been approved hopefully it's going to work  right now :) ! check link again if you have time
---
Chris Cleary tweeted it
---
No.
---
They've actually said they're planning to cut out a lot of that filler, because it was made when FFXIV *really* could not spare the resources as it had just been completely remade.
---
Do you actually people in marketing make $30,000? Try more like 60-120k depending on experience.
---
What I saw was different.
---
More like what you describe in 2nd. They were joining already made LFG groups to spam. Now that I think of it, it was when the commander left. The other occasions must been similar I do not remember, I though they just joined and left, but I think I was the one leaving so it could be a ending group.
---
Maybe, but not if you try to raid at that time. 
---
Kinda ironical that this exessive advertising for a Raid tournament prevented people from actual raiding.
---
Aye dun wahnt tit
---
ls4 maps would be more interesting if they actually stick to 1 single theme and a smaller area. episode 2 could just be a better rata primus, 3 a better necropolis, 5 a better dwavern ruin. Perhaps with the extra dev time they could make more instanced content like fractals every ls? The new fractals are too big for the player base to appreciate too, so anet should stop thinking large!=more content
---
The plan is just to re-release Wow Classic updates in the same order they were originally released in.
---
Not only Collin. All the original visionaries and great minds were slowly replaced by a feel-good club of friends and business minds who see this as a computer "mobile game".
---
"Guild [XYZ] Selling ERM token right now! 230MC!"
---
Should scroll up a bit, I commented about that. Now they just need to fix the dyes/glamours system.
---
Lol.... forgot about that one. Lolololol
---
I don't think it has 5 active players
---
I completed the last 8 months of WoW content in a single weekend. I'm glad I got 3 free days and didn't have to pay £120 for it like active subscribers do.
---
WoW is a rip-off, players only get a fraction of what they pay for and BFA is a wasteland. Not to mention all the players sick of them dumbing down the game so much that they want to go back to 2004.
---
That and most Guild Wars 2 fashion is overblown, ugly, and clips through characters' hairstyles and appendages.
---
Soda also didn't think much of gw2 the 2 days he tried PvP  lol
---
I only occasionally visit this sub, and seeing ERP all over the place made me go,"Uh... what." 
---
Apparently it isn't that, but I didn't want to go digging.
---
/u/manimarco1108  I mean hardcore veterans usually quit if they are not pleased about specific thing, It did happen to WoW and other mmos any "disappointment announcement" Veteran will ALT+F4 and uninstall the game. You can't please everyone in any specific game mode per say.
---
Also you should make it into count of "layoff" of ArenaNet staff, which can delay anything.
---
Let me ask you personally what do you like to see as an announcement for 30th of August ?
---
When you have Lv 500 of crafting and there's 3,000 items to scroll through but 90% of them are useless and you just want to refine something
---
But the order of categories are randomized and always all open by default
---
It's scrolling down for me actually.
---
/u/morroIan right now yes, but it was solid 9 hours of exposure on each category, we can actually reach 14k-17k if we worked together as a community o/
---
Fake taxi ftw
---
This sub is a mess the last days - and i’m not talking about the mods or the rules.
---
For sure. I understand they had a lot to tackle trying to balance across three game modes, condi especially. Just sad to see it come to this.
---
As far as I am concerned, Anet don't deserve even the slightest respect on account of them disrespecting us.
---
They made it to buy time when people were leaving GW2 due to no end game at launch. It added a grind for a new set of gear to do harder endgame content. I think you're right, it should have been removed once they added raids and had no more use to slow down people.
---
Got a clip of that? How could I miss this
---
What are you talking about? Dark souls has all this stuff and is considered some of the hardest PVE out there. Action games play different than traditional mmos, and you can't really compare time to clear a raid between the two models.
---
Recently many people started blaming Anet for not supporting ERP. 
---
The reason was a tool, a camera hack that was used to get a better view.
---
Anet didn't want to support an event where this "technically bannable" tool is used.
---
Anet fanboys are the worst.
---
Hardcores and veterans are expecting the 30th August announcement to be an expansion. Anything less than an expansion will result in a mass exodus and kill GW2 for sure.
---
Ok.
---
Yes, they supported the previous one (and/or the ARP).
---
Can't speak for other ERPs. However this time they had a reason, they were actually willing to support it, just with the requirement of not using this camera hack.
---
I hope you never get anything given to you ever again. People like you are why we can’t have nice things...
---
I burned every. single. one. MWAHAHAHAH
---
^^^^^praise joko
---
BDO chat is the worst I've ever seen and first time I was grateful for being able to turn on censorship.
---
My guild died six years ago and the emblem sucks. ANet pls fix.
---
Having done a lot of PvP and GvG in the early days of GW1, pretty much.
---
Bingo.  A few dozen posts on reddit and the forums isn't going to make the company change (especially when they censor forum posts).  They lost nearly 1/4 of their workforce but if they actually were going to change, someone would have chimed in by now saying, "Just wait until the 30th before you make your decision".  Anything to build more hype...but nothing.  They announced the date and nothing more.
---
The 30th is going to be a LS5 trailer.  Its going to showoff a new map and build templates mostly.  MO or Mike Z will talk for about 10-20 minutes and then note some smaller features coming with episode one.  To expect raids, WvW alliances, or anything PvP at all to be talked about on the 30th is more than wishful thinking.  I don't mean to sound like a negative Nancy here but its the reality of the situation.
---
This is most evident in the HOT vs POF discussions. Just look at map metas vs bounties. Bounties are literal zerg fests where individual contribution means nothing. As long as you land a few attacks on the loot Pinata you get a reward. Map metas took skill and coordination.
---
There's no reason POF couldn't have both. Instead we've had no really engaging content outside of HOT. Ever since POF the game has just been a gigantic, shallow mess.
---
I can't say I agree at all.
---
This isn't WoW, the vast majority of players don't touch raids at all, and that's the communities fault itself.
---
What anet SHOULD HAVE DONE, was add a lower difficulty, lower reward, setting to the raids. This would act as a stepping stone to bolster groups and bring them in to raids. It would have expanded the pool of people who tried/attempted to join the raiding community.
---
You can't just go 0-100 and say "This is fine". Every other MMO has figured that out at this point EXCEPT GW2.
---
I mean, I offered you help the last time you brought this up and complained, but you pretty much blew me off.
---
the programmers should have been fired lol. 
---
We should tell NCSoft about this.
---
&gt; we as a whole community 
---
That is where you lost me. I am fairly new to the game in the overall scheme of things, but I simply don't have the issues some people have. And I have been following this conversation in Reddit over the past couple of months or so.
---
What you should have said is "our *section* of the community". But then that opens up the whole conversation about size and return on investment and a bunch of stuff like that. I am not saying ANet is right and players are wrong or vice versa.
---
I am saying that taking your personal viewpoint and projecting it onto the entire GW2 community is not going to win you any support.
---
EA virus is slowly seeping into their bloodstream.
---
[Fixed it.](https://i.imgur.com/p532wEy.jpg)
---
Hmm, we still get content regulary, there are still hundreds of thousands activ players, Anet actually *do* listen to the community (not to everything and it's not perfect of course, but they do). 
---
I don't know, but how do a "dead game" looks like in your head? 
---
You may should read less of this subreddit. You probably think it's the whole playerbase chatting here. It's actually only a very small part. And obviously the complaining group is much louder than the statisfied group, but that's not only here, that's always the case.
---
Whats an erp
---
&gt; Your paychecks will no doubtly be getting thinner post 30th if there isn't something significant for veteran players.
---
If what they have planned to announce on the 30th isn't **HUGELY IMPACTFUL**, then the game is going to go downhill so fast.
---
Unlike a lot of people here, I will still play GW2. I've been playing this game since GW1 and I still feel too attached to it to ever leave it permanently. I'll keep supporting it until the day the servers go down, but it really does kill me on the inside to have read some of the stuff that was being said on the streams over the weekend. 
---
I'll keep my hopes high for the 30th, as always.
---
if they listened, do you really think the only content we'd be getting every 3-4 months is one open world map and have game modes that have been neglected for borderline years?
---
Where can I sign up to start shilling? 
---
How much they pay?
---
That's true, I had a brain fart moment.
---
Let's see how Friday's announcement fairs against that
---
Because no one who disagrees with you or the OP can be anything but a paid shill. /s
---
What I saw was differnt.  
---
4 LFG's selling raids.
---
I think you should look up dead in the dictionary. I don't think it means what you think it means.
---
&gt;They expect companies to go against the terms of service they set out.
---
As they teach in Management 101 in business school, "policies are guidelines for decision making." Unless a policy is designed to mirror a legal obligation or requirement, a business can wave it at any time. It's completely reasonable to expect them to make reasonable exceptions.
---
It's also completely reasonable to expect them to make good policies in the first place. GW2's UI customization is over a decade out of date. They are still using leeches to balance humors, while WOW and other MMOs have appropriately customizable UIs that match what different play modes or personal preferences require.
---
Im curious to see if they ban him. 
---
He publicly used a hack live on Twitch. 
---
I think Twitch bans players that use hacks as well, don't they?
---
Elitist raiding party, but they did chose that abbrevation for a reason.
---
Well they COULD pull the stick out of their arses and maybe relax a bit if people create tools to create content because they themselves won't. But they're still technically in the right, so there is that. Everyone knows that technically right is the best kind of right.
---
The problem isn't Anet or Teapot, the problem is Teapots incel army that knows neither nuance nor reason or rationality and just blindly bashes their bullshit and are a cancer and a blight upon the land, the game and this subreddit. Without them, we're all better off.
---
That's why people are glad to see Teapot gone. Not because of him. Because of the howling morons that follow in his wake and are nothing but hate and memes and unresolved trauma.
---
I'd love it if he did give the option of spoiling though for those that want to find out. I'm never bothered by spoilers and love to know everything that's coming.
---
https://youtu.be/2GgGTsxqWWM
---
This seems very plausible tbh
---
Doubt it as far as I am aware its been known for a while that he was going to be using this camera thing and he hasn't been banned yet and he shouldn't be banned Anet did the right thing not advertising the event.
---
Oh man.  Don't even get me started on how guild stuff has been abandoned.
---
Not even close, try /pol/.
---
This year has been a lot of staff layoffs and disappointments, questionable design decisions by Anet and often sub-par execution. But also a big conclusion to a large part of the plot since HoT began. There has been a good amount of community rumbling that the game feels directionless and isn't being what it has the potential to be, and with a big announcement coming Aug 30 a lot of folks are seeing it as the make or break for the game. What they announce might be enough to restore faith in the community or it might not.
---
Don't worry because when guild chat comes around again, 1000 people will be watching to see what funny ways the community can draw a quaggan!
---
I mean the half-norn thing sounds stupid enough to be something Anet would do.
---
Do I have to stop playing if the game is dead? I haven't stopped enjoying it but I guess if I gotta I will
---
As someone with more hours than that I agree with the sentiment
---
You seem like an overly negative fellow.
---
The game is beyond dead and it'll be worse post 30th August.
---
So does that mean I'm not allowed to keep playing?
---
Thats player who are lazy because they wouls like to brain dead farm daily same way all the time, and instabilities make smarter one adapt, less smarter repeat same tactic and cry.
---
I've been super distance from GW2 but noticed at the end of the vod it was kinda emotional from the announcers and twitch chat can someone give me the history behind teapot and him allegedly not streaming gw2? He's moving on or bored of it? I'm just out of the loop.
---
it's still a beautiful game to play....even if someone else thinks its dead.
---
Anet literally told you already what you will see on 30th. And you are still expecting an expansion?
---
Whats the difference?
---
They make it better, it uses to be way unfun interactions or being puniesh for not teamworking with pugs. Now there are no op instabilities.
---
Translation: the people I played with are hopping over to grind for a few months in WoW Classic and it is making this game feel dead to me.
---
Some one noticed other hand of this discussion, bravo.
---
Anet never supported this or any other ERP tournament primarily because of the word "Elitist" which is ofc just for memes. Then again memes are instantly banned on Anet streams. The camera hack was just another excuse. 
---
Dont forget that anet barely ever sponsored any PvP tourney as they  asked for at least 16/20 teams to participate which is ofc absurd with the current numbers. All in all, they dont actually care about anything competitive. Also, being partnered with anet is the same as not being partnered at all. They offer zero promotion and advertisement to their content creators. Anet was always poor at marketing the game.
---
wait, I don't understand that first sentence. Teapot has been incredibly negative and pessimistic for a loooooooong time, so your opening sentence makes 0 sense.
---
They've been pretty transparent about not giving a flying fuck about balancing for and prioritizing content creation for instanced PvE.
---
This is a Guild Wars game in name only, it bears zero resemblance to the first game both in content philosophy and cash store approach.
---
Their class designers make specs and weapons and utility skills with pvp and open world brainless zerg pve and little thought actually gets put for instanced PvE class balance, especially with dps specs across classes having performance deltas as large as 30%+.
---
WoW and FFXIV would never have deltas this bad.
---
100%.  There is one BG guild with 2 commanders and 1 FC commander that all PPT.  Its the same people day in and day out.  There's no truce or any conspiracy theories to even think about.
---
The main reason BG usually has half of everything is because when one PPT commander tags down, the other tags right up.  That's how they outmatch the FC guy.
---
As if your little feel good positive reinforcement would help Anet change.  
---
We have called out the problems and fixes for YEARS without anything done about them. Lets not even get started on the poor PvP and WvW bois. On top of.that we have this lack of repeatable, rewarding content. So yes it is time to move on, why do you think everyone in chat was saying RIP GW2?
---
The difficulty would be relevant to the content itself. The fractal/boss would have more interesting/complex mechanics. Just throwing random stuff into make it more difficult is lazy.
---
He announced 1-2 months ago that after ERP he's leaving for WoW classic. He's bored after playing the same game every day for 7 years but the main reason is he's disappointed with the current state and direction of the game. All competitiveness is gone from the game, pvp is in bad state,same as  wvw, new raid wing was ez af, most classes got completely streamlined, anet is just milking the gem store. The game desperately needs a change but anet just keep releasing story episodes instead of actually going for an expansion which is sad.
---
Except the people who come from GW1 didn't order a fucking chicken sandwich, they ordered the fish sandwich from the beginning and instead got a soggy cold chicken sandwich.
---
GW1 was a fucking instanced game, with instanced PVE and instanced PVP. GW2 threw that in the trash bin and put content creation emphasis on brainless, poor longevity open world zerg farm content and then doubled down on its WvW cousin, creating an even worse balance nightmare of having to balance classes across instanced pve, open world pve, wvw, and spvp. Which is obviously impossible, so everyone is unhappy.
---
GW1 also gave most armors and cosmetic rewards from within the game, and the acquisition of items didn't boil down to some shitty gold farm swiped away by opening the wallet to circumvent it. GW2 has got to be one of the most unrewarding MMO's in the west, with the vast majority of cosmetics being tied to the cash store unlike GW1 who had limited cosmetics in the cash store and mostly made money by selling mission updates and frequent expansions.
---
careful, a lot of posters here get their talking points from there :v
---
I had more fun when doimg cm or even t4 fractals, making personal level raise then after getting used to it.
---
August 30th is going to just be an announcement for Living Story. Nothing of value will come out of it aside from a concrete release date (which many here have an idea of when it'll be coming anyway), so I don't know why people are banking on this date as a turning point.
---
Another Tequatl rework would be more groundbreaking than what we're likely to get on the 30th anyway.
---
Anet supported ERP by not banning players live on stream.
---

---
Funny thing is, I have a lot of fun with the dress-up element, the dyes, collecting armor appearances and all that.
---
But I don't care if there's no compelling gameplay for me to engage in. I want to customize my character and *then* bring them into some exciting new content, not just customize them as the be-all end-all.
---
If Anet thought the camera might be glitchy that could also have made them nervous about sponsoring. Since it's not their code, in the back of their minds they're worried the whole thing is gonna short out with thousands of people watching and people would just think Anet screwed up.
---
Sorry, but game companies don’t make sandwiches to order.
---
F to pay respects to Anet.
---
Blind positivity isn't helpful.  There is a time and place for negativity and after years of things not being fixed or prioritized negativity is fine
---
I fucking loved the dungeons in vanilla GW2 - I don't care that they were kind of crusty and broken, the concept of each dungeon having several 'paths' was awesome, and could have been expanded on forever. 
---
When they added a new path for TA, I thought for sure that was what they were going to do going forward - just keep adding new paths, exploring these dungeons in different ways, telling different stories that all tie into the world (this was when LS1 was a thing - when the LS actually did change the world in some respect) - and in general providing a lot of variety without the dev time of having to make a whole new dungeon every single time.
---
Instead, they abandoned them entirely, and we have Fractals. Fractals are fun, but they feel like bite-sized ideas of what could be really fun and amazing dungeons, and don't really last long enough to live up to their full potential.
---
I dont even play gw2 and stumbled upon all this shit and know anet fucked up. They are losing a huge marketing tool by being too stubborn  to allow or add in a spectator too. All they have to do is buy the tool from the guy who hacked/developed it. Boom. Now people can spectate raids to learn them, and people can stream them. Streaming raids, doing tournaments=17k viewers on a regular base=more people and a stronger player base=more desire and a need for anet to provide good content instead of stupid shit like send us your best screenshots on Twitter. The concept of being moral to a fault isnt some made up expression. And you're both idiots going down with the titanic while everyone else is trying to bring out more life boats. Disgusting.
---
Season 5: Jormag's Jolly Jade Sea Adventure
---
They didn't even have to add whole new dungeons outright - there's *TONS* of unused geometry in even the existing dungeons they could have used for new paths.
---
So much missed potential...
---
Thwm instead of killing ls maps you also kill prestine farm. Sw only?
---
Ty!
---
I’d rather just leave than wallow in an ever-increasingly toxic community
---
Wrong. The tool was not used for the last tournament, other than the trailer, yet there was not a single word from anet advertising it. Don't be delusional.
---
I honestly wouldn't mind the focus on living world at all if it came with more than just a story mission, small zone and a meta-event every half a year.
---
The idea of the world changing as the story does was very cool, but unfortunately only LS1 (and to a lesser extent 2) really achieved the 'living' part. Right now the new zones may as well be part of the story instance, because they feel cordoned off from the world to begin with.
---
For me, it looks like a sleeveless shirt.
---
Where is this?
---
That just *needs* to be part of ascended food.
---
You sound so casual that you could play for 7 years and still not reach lvl 80
---
The subreddit rules state that spoilers only last for 28 days.
---
Sure people can be considerate and not post unavoidable "spoilers" anyways. But he isn't breaking sub rules.
---
I don't know what they talked about internally, but giving them GM accounts is a bit heavy. Being popular streamers don't make them *this* trustfull. As far as we know from Anet streams they also use a special dev client that allows them to do things normal players can't do. So it's also questionable if it's even possible (in a reasonable time / reasonable effort) to create/trimm a GM account that can do nothing except for invisible flying. With a normal client.
---
At this point supporting someone doesn't mean to give him everything he need/want
---
However iIfc it was Teapot who rejected the support, because he wanted to use his camera hack.
---
Some people play raids as they always do... why anet should support them? They're just playing the game. Anet should focus on serious things.
---
This. I don't know anyone ingame who was interested in this event, and I didn't even hear anyone mention it. And I have hundreds of people in my friend list.
---
At this point Anet could do anything and all people would do is criticize it.
---
Yes, I want them to communicate more, and I have my own concerns for the game, but has it never occurred to people that we’re part of the problem?
---
I get your point and all but if the entire community raised 1g, it'd just be a meme. It's not so much about the amount but about capacity vs action.
---
First thing, I'm not really defending it, I've read about it like half year ago.
---
Pristine farm still have it's uses. Augmentations. That's not something a regular player will do in short amount of time. Also, I know how player base complained about marks before, that's not something unexpected. On the other hand it helped keeping some prices up.
---
And on top of it, a requirement of other materials and gold will force players to do more than one content in game.
---
Also yeah, I would miss current ls3 item acquisition.
---
How do I delete someone else's comment? Please jaw, dont give any ideas....
---
white walkers confirmed
---
But what can you do, people will keep bitching on anet nonstop no matter what because that's what mob mentality does. Fanatism is at the utmost very top of the line with streamers nowadays. Even when the streamers themselves are not promoting not endorsing this type of behaviour, something around their speech make these kind of people think that's what the streamers want.
---
Most of this stuff seems to line up now
---
It exist. In PvP. Implementing it into raids means dev work, changing code, updating the client (for all players), most likely hotfixes for bugs.
---
As a future tool it's a pretty nice idea, but for a single community event, it's way too much.
---
He took a game to put on the best gw2 event of all time.
---
This is not how supporting works. Trying to sell something would make it worse.
---
https://inanage.com/2018/02/05/estimating-gw2s-population/
---
A study/research from 2018. Refering to this GW2 had about 1,5 million active players. The highest peak was about 19k viewers iIrc, so that's ~1,27%. 
---
The study is based on the ["80/20/5 rule"](https://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/149466049419/80-20-5) which sounds a bit arbitrary, but it's surprisingly accurate. I recommend to read this post, it's really interesting.
---
Yeap. Anet didn't want to support it because they viewed it as an exploit... feelsbadman
---
&gt; raiders or other hardcore veterans that plan on quitting soon
---
or that already quit and haven't touched the game in quite a while, only watching because it was from a streamer they like.
---
Mechanically they have been adding raid attack telegraphs and some mechanics to open world. In my opinion a decent move, except with 50 ppl noone does them anyway lol.
---
You see how much hate they are getting just for not officially supporting the event?
---
They can't support the hack, but they aren't using it maliciously. It would just be stupid amounts of bad look to ban them on top of it. Anet didn't want to stop the event, they just didn't want to back it when the camera hack is being used.
---
*Ahem*
---
*Cattlepault*.
---
It's the raid tournament made solely by the community with zero support from Anet.
---
He leaves with a boom. This was probably the peak for GW2 Twitch streaming. Sad that he is leaving, he did really a lot for the community and this tournament with the camera hack will be most likely the only opportunity for a lot of players to see that raids.
---
&gt; but has it never occurred to people that we’re part of the problem?
---
How? How are we the problem? How did the community turn Anet's upper management into a bunch of mouthbreathing imbeciles?
---
Because the camera tool is essentially a hack from the game point of view or if you want to be generous about it, it is a mod which is extremely not ToS compliant.
---
From a PR point of view the decision makes sense to me even if it sucks a lot for the tournament. It could have become a kind of a nightmare to deal with the fallout of supporting an event using an explicitly forbidden tool. Again, not talking about how it could have been nice to have them but the moderation, litigation and global shitstorm they could have got themselves into from some other parts of the community was probably not really worth.
---
(And again as usual it's probably a decision coming from management/PR and and people closer to the content creation probably had 0 say in it, before anybody wants to start taking their pitchfork)
---
Raiders: This event was the last victory for the game and it's players. After this it will only go downhill to its incoming sunset.
---
Me, a casual player who only logs in to pet quagans: ok.
---
Yeah, but Wow classic in the end is practically dead content. After a certain milestone, you won't see new content ever again.
---
Maybe just the festivals... Don't even think that they will balance the game anymore. Too much effort... Since they already have to balance WoW.
---
It's not even hate towards not supporting him or the event. Its the hate for missing out on a major chance to do good for their game.
---
Of the 17k viewers how much do you think still plays the game? Teapot streams daily with 400-500 viewers and 90% of his viewers have quit the game.
---
Like someone mentioned, a lot of people tuned in to send a message out to anet that this is the hardcore scene they have abandoned.
---
I totally agree with you. Blizzard is such a huge company that has 10 times more employees and makes over 1.5 Billion USD revenue annually through many different IPs, IIRC ArenaNet only makes like 70 million annually with only one IP?!
---
So comparing both companies just with "but blizzard does this very well so why not ArenaNet too?" is IMO a comparison you just can't make.
---
However, ArenaNet could grow their audience a lot by investing more in advertising their game.
---
To add to your last paragraph, ERP usually has 8 teams but they could only get 6 teams for this tournament.
---
do your own special event and see how it is allowed. the exception is for anyone if the occasion is proper
---
Well, the latest raid wing was quite a disappointment in a LOT of ways. Literally there are even obvious bugs that have been left in the latest raid since release (over 2 months ago).  Additionally, the other wings are buggy too. In fact if you watched a lot of the ERP, you will hear about the bugs mentioned a lot. Many of us have seen this story before, dungeon bugs were never fixed either.  
---
Also, there is the fact that even though there have been threads asking, Anet has chosen not to tell anyone whether they intend to ever release another raid.  
---
Also, two updates clearly targeting hardcore players, legendary runes and ascended food, are not exactly hot with raiders.  At most they are luke warm.  Mean while, the need for build templates is stronger than ever now that firebrigade is so good vs double chrono, and yet still not in the game.  
---
And finally, the release cadence is just too slow.  With options like final fantasy and classic wow becoming so appealing, a lot of the top tier guilds are leaving this game.  If you can't get teammates of comparable skill to raid with you, raiding sucks.  So this is a bit of a feedback loop.  Also, the elite groups are the ones that have the time and dedication to actually test things.  Even pug groups benefit greatly from this information.
---
And to add further to that, Teapot wanted this to be the biggest ERP with 12 teams. Not the smallest with 6.
---
[dP] was filming the last 10% of the deimos of the finale, digging even deeper in the ground during the cinematic
---
Savage, just savage.
---
&gt; You could say ANYTHING in this sub and SOMEBODY will make it an opportunity to talk about how shitty the game is now!
---
It used to be the other way around, and that denial got us here. The community was busy silencing any criticism of the game for years. The message was clear to Anet: they can get away with doing fuckall and just milking the playerbase as the game slowly dies.
---
Even now we are way too tame. The community should've turned on Anet ages ago because that's the only thing left to do. Anet has been out of touch for almost a decade now and not amount of feedback is going to miraculously turn things around. Anet doesn't give a fuck about what we think or say. Discussion is utterly pointless. The only way to make them listen is to create negative press for them.
---
&gt; and do not listen to any feedback.
---
So, changing HoTs difficulty, implementing a larger storage space for additional items, action cam and many other things were they not listening to feedback?
---
I mean tbh it can be applicable to a lot of group content. If one mostly does open-world events then sure this will probably not be very useful to that person and it's probably normal that it does not. However if you want to do some sort of group content and want to see if X would work better than Y or if Z can be good enough then it totally matters. Note that this is not only limited to PvE, the current "unofficial but authorized" meter is also very useful for WvW squads to see the movements of the group, if too many people didn't end up out of place after a move, how boons were corrupted/stripped by your group, how what was the main damage source of you group, etc. For anything with a group where you want the content to be enjoyable and smooth then it definitively has value.

Top Quality Reddit Circlejerk™
---
I was being the most conservative I could be to be as reasonable as possible.  
---
Anet anet employees are known to have fairly meh wages as far as I know.
---
&gt;And even when it was working it wasn't noticeably better than the normal view.
---
So you have never actually tried to watch a normal raid stream then? Because it's pretty fucking unwatchable. The camera made the tournament 1000x more watchable, especially the zoomed out overhead views that actually let you see what the whole raid was doing, instead of being focused on a single person in the middle of a particle spam clusterfuck.
---
Nonsense. There are plenty of challenging high quality games out there. For example DCS world (air combat), Pathfinder: Kingmaker (roleplaying), Dirt Rally 2 (driving), Hears of Iron (strategy) to name a few semi recent ones that I have played.
---
Gw2 simply does not focus on challenge and that is fine. There are plenty of challenging games out there if that's your thing.
---
&gt; poor marketing in general
---
just a thought here from someone who also plays a LOT of Dota 2, but I honestly can't think of any marketing from Valve to promote Dota 2 other than the yearly "The International Dota 2 Tournament", which btw just ended Sat/Sun (depends on timezone)
---
To each their own. I have that many hours as well and I still log in every day
---
i  thought topic will be about this moment https://www.twitch.tv/videos/472145474?t=09h09m04s
---
which is also quite positive
---
Their support was what, 2k gems and a tweet? And plenty of people do not understand why the rage, anet just missed out on a great opportunity to advertise not game mode or community, THE GAME ITSELF. Offer a limited dev account just for the 2 spectators and problem solved, no need to implement cameras etc. Nope too hard. 2000 gems will do. 
---
Its absurd shit like banners with "arrrrghhh" and weekly gemstore posts are considered advertisement.
---
&gt;The game is most certainly dying, the content droughts have gotten very bad.
---
bingo, and while GW2 is stagnating others are stepping up - last I heard FFXIV's newest expansion is supposed to be _really_ fucking good, TESO is apparently doing pretty well and WoW has Classic coming up (and hopefully something better than the mess that was BFA)
---
Just the sub shifting into anti-Anet mode again, they'll revert back to loving Anet in a few days
---
Double expansion exp event want? Perhaps if they actually had a PR team players might know this, got any links?
---
Big oof
---
So, this isn't Erotic Role Play then?
---
It’s one thing to negatively critique the game. Even I can agree to that. But this is past the point of critique. It’s like nothing good about the game even exists anymore. Even for the games I don’t like, I can admit that there are good things. But nobody wants to see that anymore. Not here.
---
People like me, that want to believe that things are going to get better, are being pushed out. It’s happening right now. I just left the sub because I know the 30th will come and no matter what happens - whether it’s just a new living world or a complete revamp of every aspect we’re going on about - this sub will be an absolute shitshow.
---
This isn’t just negative press, this is an apocalypse. Nothing is ever going to be enough.
---
If Aurine eating Joko is your measurement, you clearly weren't around when Shoto Tagachi kills your entire party at one of the early Factions missions... Then the Envoys bring you back to life, just as you're going "well WTF was that?!"
---
ok
---
End-game players often come bundled with a varying amount of toxicity, I'd say good riddance
---
The butthurt is understandable. Toxic casuals can't accept that gemstore and quaggans are not the only thing this game has to offer.
---
Valve sponsors Dota 2 TI every year along with other third party smaller tourneys. TI has so far the biggest prizepool out of any tournaments in any game. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
---
As someone who hasn't ever touched raids (yes im a filthy casual PvE player, sue me lol), what exactly is the issue with the third party tool?
---
No idea why you're getting down voted lol
---
I mean the game has been going downhill since August 2012 lol
---
2000 gems woho
---
he got viewbotted:

https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cvkknu/erp_got_viewbotted_17k_are_you_kidding_me/
---
I like the game a lot, not my fault anet is fucking up the game
---
I mean, I mentioned that I agree on that before you posted it.
---
That's the entire point of my post, it might be inconsiderate, but not against the rules.
---
Hmm ... looking through the lens of reddit he seems to be surrounded by a lot of negativity
---
It is sad to see how the million of dollar anet spend on competitive pvp couldn't bring that much viewerships on one single channel either. If this isn't enough of a wake up call for anet, I don't know what is either.
---
You can't have your cake and eat it too. This subreddit has too many children.
---
&gt;From a PR point of view the decision makes sense
---
*Looks at the title of this thread*
---
*Looks at twitch chat spamming NOT SUPPORTED BY ANET BTW*
---
Does it really?
---
? Haven't played for 7 years, all of the characters I have are level 80, are you trolling?
---
i think that this is the top moment of GW2 before Anet destroy it at 30th august... xd
---
If you actually open your eyes you lot, the casual "I'm swimming next to a tuna hoho" are toxic ones. All you ask for is people to leave gw2 constantly, now do a reality check. Who is the negative and toxic prick? People who want to see the game get better or a lot of uncivilized plebs screaming "ur toxic, leave"?
---
U'll keep getting yout shit minipets and crappy story content, why cant other people have fun in the game they like as well?
---
they could've just worded it differently in a post without ever saying ERP directly
---
To be fair, a lot of that toxicity was already there way before any DPS meter, so adding or removing one would not change much. Let's just say that the toxicity was unfortunately here to begin with and as much as I would want it not to be true there are toxic people in a lot of places and you will probably not want to play with them in any context whatsoever.
---
At the very least using such a tool would allow you to clear out some parts of those people in good conscience without doubting yourself (just like when some people get hung up on getting exactly a number of LI in LFG and won't accept anything that counts as a trasnformed LI but is actually not an LI).
---
In this context the meter is an invaluable tool for groups to help them improve, the only things missing (that the current meter does not have fully access too through memory reading) is healing from all sources (to see if you are not overlapping too much with other healers, if you want you bring is enough, what you should focus more on, which healer is more valuable in a specific setting, etc) and Defiance Bar output (probably more valuable for high-end optimization or groups having issues with a CC-heavy boss). And again it's not about blaming but about improving the group and the good outbalances heavily the bad in this case imo.
---
What website did you use and why does the Screenshot resoloution suck so much?
---
He actually did, that's why Anet refused to sponsor it. You'd think they would have just found a way to implement a "spectator mode," but whatever.
---
It's surprising how many people seem to think FC WANT to be in T1, ENJOY being in T1, are even COLLUDING with BG to stay in T1! It's ridiculous! I am constantly hearing this from my pvx guilds and people on other servers. If we all loved T1 so much, ALL of the FC guilds would still be playing wvw! Sure, some of us prefer to fight the red team but that's because usually they give better fights, don't hide behind their keeps pew pewing us with AC's and don't constantly blob us down. Yeah, we have an amazing commander who enjoys ppt, but guess what, we were all happily in T2 even with a ppt commander with our previous  link. Since the first week of linking with JQ, we've been stuck in T1! JQ have alot of SEA players, pug tags and people who just like to cap everything. But i don't really blame them, it's not their fault that they, who were a Very High server were linked with a Full server at the time of linking. G.G ANET. Or us FC players who don't want to tank, want to play the game, don't want to sit around in our keep or at spawn when bg has taken it, which happens often every night, so why the heck would we not go to take our stuff back, but wait, that's ppt maybe we should let bg keep everything. We want to enjoy fights which usually means fighting the red team. And yeah, we like to pick off players who are straggling behind, whatever team they may be on. Anet really need to do something about wvw, alot of guilds and players have already left wvw, including guilds on bg's link as well as other servers, all frustrated with the way wvw is and with Anet's lack of effort into their own game.
---
It’s making fun of how anet was actively refusing to support this event, one that’s become one of the biggest community events for gw2 in a while, because of a add on that they don’t like even though it just makes the game easier to spectate
---
Hello everyone,
---
New player here. I'm not sure which Class I should be picking. Here's what I'm aiming for:
---
Being a new father, it's hard to me to get a proper gaming schedule. So I probably going to be playing on variable time periods. Therefore, I cant group much as I can't commit for 30 minutes of total focus (baby crying!). So I need a class which can hold it's own and solo and much as possible. Reading some old posts in Reddit mentioned Necromancer is the right tool for the job. That being said, a lot of the people who did took Necromancer, mentioned his too easy to play (summon minions and Afk for a bit), Less variable (so in case in the future I will have more time and want to group up -  most people don't want a necromancer). 
---
So I'm interesting to hearing what you think about Necros, and if there's another more versatile skill-based class I can pick instead and still being able to do everything the Necro can solo wise.
---
Also - out of scope question, but better than creating a new post here. I noticed A and D rotate instead of strafe left and right. This is strange for me. Maybe it's was like that in WoW also and I can't remember? is there any reason why no to set A/D to strafe instead of Q/E and change angle with the mouse?
---
Thanks!
---
those are throwaway accounts anyway wouldn't make a difference anymore
---
Idk, during start of HoT there's been quite big focus on raids considering that they got released 3-5 months from each other. Not to mention that people complained how HoT was difficult in general so Anet had to dumb it down.
---
If we learn from history its a bigger chance they'll dissapoint with possibly a mobile title or just a boring cadence of LS.
---
As someone unfamiliar with what happened, could you guys give me a vod link or a youtube highlight or video? Thanks in advance.
---
Too late
---
So, I really liked the ERP, but what really sold me to gw2 was the taxi cab video

Not having any achievement behind the completion of the funny task of climbing a volcano by leaping against its walls and, once done, moving out. Eventually coming back for gathering wood. 
---
And the maps with JP's aren't the same ones than maps with nice events and rewards.
---
It seems like it's one or the other, so I choose things to do and re-do. And you cannot face the wall all the time.
---
Even I would be disappointed if it was a mobile title. And I want to hope that it’s more than LS...though I have my own qualms with if we go to fight Jormag...~~Anet, Eir should be part of the fight gdi.~~

I only recently started playing. Why does it seem like the general feeling of this sub is that having consistent endgame tier content drops with adequate challenges is incompatible with keeping a casual friendly game on other areas? Maybe destiny spoiled me too hard, because there we have good raids and endgame content and the rest of the game is pretty casual friendly. All I see here is people almost literally mad that others want more content drops just because it's not on their skill level.
---
I also heard that the minimal amount of competitors is 8 teams, while this one had just 6.
---
&gt; but they made it extra easy.
---
Well i've just watched the best players the game wiping on it so i wouldn't call it *that* easy.
---
You think making a new zone every 3-4 months with new story is minimal effort?  It would be easier to do other stuff. The fact is, this game has taken the hard way out in a lot of ways.
---
Do you know why so many MMOs use a quest hub system to level? Because it's easier. You know the exact amount of XP each hub gives, which brings you to a certain level and a breadcrumb trail to get to the next hub. Simple math.
---
Anet said early on you need roughly five times the number of dynamic events as you do static quests. This game launched with more DEs (over 1500) than ALL four Guild Wars 1 titles had quests. Prophecies itself launched with 203 quests, by comparison.
---
This game has never taken the easy way out,  not once ever. If they wanted the easy way out, they wouldn't have done dynamic events in the first place.
---
In fact, I think part of the issue is how long it takes to make those new zones, populated with dynamic event and story. I think Anet has put a lot of eggs in one basket. But if you think this game is in some kind of maintenance mode, you've never played a game in one. 
---
As for focus, this game was always focused on living world. PvP, though Anet did want an esport was never a focus. Anet even said straight up before launch they spent a year talking about PvE before they started talking about PvE to break the illusion that this game centered around PvP.
---
Can you explain?
---
Anet doesn't meme, in fact you can't even use a large amount of Twitch emotes/memes on their channel.
---
They were only released with a 3-5 month pace from Wing 1 to 3. Those are the wings without challenge modes, as we've come to know them. The 7 to 9 month release rate for wings with CMs was established between SotF and BotP and that cadence has been consistent for over 3 years. Anet has never catered to a hardcore raiding scene, as much as I'd personally like that, and kicking up drama around that has always seemed odd to me.
---
I definitely agree with the HoT difficulty issue though. HoT was amazing and it was a shame to see it nerfed and then PoF release without any reasonable difficulty or sense of exploration and adventure that HoT had.
---
The reason is a simple one that everybody keeps forgetting, the code for GW2 is an absolute abhorent mess and if they allow people to get into the code to make mods there will be a giant clusterfuck of hacks.   
---
Remember how they keep saying shit like build templates or programming weapons to be dyable is almost impossible for them? Sphagetti code is the reason.
---
Exactly what I did, tbh. Playing FF14 now, and while it's also far from perfect (though the specific flaws are quite different so it works as a fresh breeze anyhow) the overall production quality is better. Given that I pay monthly that's to be expected, but it's still nice to enjoy.
---
They don't support it because teapot uses a third party program for the spectating. Still not a good reason since it's just a pvp spectator cam.
---
Sadly not. :(
---
The irony is that this goodbye ERP attracted 17K viewers. A big middle finger to anet imo.
---
Debatable, really
---
I am more concerned about alien face inside that t-shirt...
---
GW2 is a game for retired secretaries with no expectations, so I have no doubt you're having time of your life here.
---
It's another fucking lw episode. Same old boring stuff.
---
Yeah and totally not because anet actually is in the wrong, nonono impossible, it's the players fault for acting like zeolots :'D  
---
Sry but after waiting for months on end on sub-par content that doesn't warrant a 150-person dev team I'm ACTUALLY salty, not because a rando on twitch said it.
---
You have something against secretaries? Or retired people? Or just having fun? Yep, I'm having tons of fun. I'd say wish you were here, but mostly I don't.  :)
---
Tis their fulltime job they cant be expected to have a clue about what actually goes on in their game!
---
And the worst part is that bounties had **real** potential. But like so many things in GW2, "wasted potential" could be their tagline.
---
What they could have done with them:
---
* Only a handful of bounty special abilities.
---
* Clearly indicated but **actually** important mechanics that truly change up how you fight against them.
---
* Spell f/x and armor/trinket effects redone to not obstruct the fight mechanics.
---
* Legendaries simply have two mechanics at the same time, since each one individually is supposed to require active work already that means these automatically go into overdrive mode.
---
* Add vendors that sell armor/weapons made from bits these legendary bounties drop.
---
The layoffs already happened and no huge good news since then. Part of reason why this kind of event is likely the final one.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_Islamic_Liberation_Front
---
This acronym didn't stop newscasters from saying MILF on live TV in a serious context. I'm sure anet can manage some tounge-in-cheek humour.
---
That… that's not how this works…
---
I honestly had no idea until now about this. However, I'm sure most anyone that hears the word "Guild" in the context of mmorpgs think only of the social function incorporated into the genre (clans, guilds, groups, etc).
---
I do that only for special people. For example, it's irrelevant to me what you think. You can block me if you like.
---
k
---
Hey man, I’m just explaining why Anet as a company might not have wanted to be associated with that. The whole camera thing might have been a scapegoat. 
---
Personally I think it’s funny, but when you really think about it, even reddit is getting censorhappy these days. 
---
All that aside though, it’s not like that many people actually even know what this was, I brought it up in each guild I’m in and in some map chats and nobody even knew what this event was, they actually thought I was talking about erotic roleplay. Lol
---
The grind is only this bad because the asocial minimum effort demand rewards culture that gw2 has. Getting 15-20 li in a few hours with a semi competent group is trivial, except pugging even 50% half capable players at 250 li is a long shot nowadays.
---
More capable players leaving wont help, itll make finding raid groups and filling them harder and less likely.

MightyTeapot: "Don't go cra-"
---
This sub: "I don't get told what to do outside of the bedroom!"
---
It would be perfect if I can have the key, so Yes, pretty please :3
---
You really need to experience a late OCX dragon's stand stuck at blighting trees.
---
Imagine, When there’s something important in your life that you need a person to step in to help you
---
And the only you know about them is the attitude, do you want a casual? Or do you want an elitist.
---
I don’t know about you but I want someone who cares so much about what’s happening that they’re going to do whatever it takes, elitist is not positive nor negative.
---
Not understanding that difference is a little inconvenient.
---
don't project pug experience on organised raiders, good players don't pug
---
Considering a recent tweet by Teapot I would wait for his video clarification on the subject before drawing any final conclusion about what was considered, could have been agreed, out of the question, etc.
---
(To be noted that I wrote the previous comment before seeing said tweet and some of the clarification may very nullify some part of it).
---
You're nice aren't you.
---
No
---
Makers of **E**nterprise **R**esource **P**lanning software suites would like to have a word with you.
---
No, they're actually throwing a fit fanboying for Teapot when even Teapot himself is telling people to chill while he clarifies the whole situation. Man, just the fact that he HAS to come out and clarify things says quite a lot.
---
Just because it didn't get sponsored by ANET doesn't devaluate it, it was big, people had a lot of fun with it, and yet some of the people that joined are deciding to overshadow what the event was with a tantrum over not getting recognition or approval.
---
Oh yeah, no doubt.
---
10/10
---
Considering that was their own statement regarding a REAL dps meter and UI mods I'm inclined to believe them
---
gw2 website omegalul, try putting update information in game, like Old School fucking runescape does.. with poll booths and such.
---
https://youtu.be/EkCIqVi0mBY
---
Relevant info starts at about the twelve minute mark, but the entire video is worth a watch.
---
wow on a thread about toxic players you're really not hepling with shitty replies like that.
---
&gt;  if they allow people to get into the code to make mods 
---
That… that's not how this works.
---
&gt; And he has every right to go toxic on this game that literally offers nothing because of their lazy ass creators. 
---
Uh?  
---
No, he has the right to drop the game and move on to something else.  
---
Toxicity only breeds more toxicity, and it's a very childish way to behave.
---
They are bored. There is not much for them to do in the game, the new endgame content releases are too infrequent and not challenging enough for them.
---
I think you can rewatch it on mighty teapots twitch page :)
---
They weren't in any position to make requests. They haven't contributed to any part of the organisation, promotion, or running of the event as far as I'm aware. Teapot is leaving so he doesn't care if he gets banned. There was no reason to comply with the request.
---
Oh, damn. That's too bad. But then I stopped playing because I got bored, so I suppose I see the trend here. Still, after some-odd 7000ish hours dumped into the game, it does make me a bit sad to see people continue to migrate away. But I guess the writing has been on the wall for awhile, huh.
---
After this weekend the anti-raid counter circle jerk will soon be out in full force to restore balance. Expect posts bashing on the negative and toxic raiders to pick up steam.
---
With a little luck and occasional sorting on controversial this sub may go into another meltdown by Aug 30th. CONTENT HYPE.
---
I think catering to casuals isn't the root of the issue but rather the result of a more profund problem. 
---
Working with dedicated communities (pve, pvp, wvw doesn't matter which) is going to be frustrating. The larger a dedicated community gets, the more demands there'll be and the lower (and less reasonable) the tolerance of failure is going to get. This doesn't mean that every member of the community shares the same opinions, but the "outspoken (toxic) minority" is bound to happen.
---
There are different ways to deal with the "outspoken minority" and I think arenanet has chosen one of the worse ways to do so. Once a dedicated community hit critical mass and the toxic rivers started flowing their approach has been to reduce both the amount of development, aswell as the amount of communication that community would receive. 
---
In turn the amount of frustration in the community rises and the "toxic minority" gets traction, leading to a downward spiral. Eventually the entire aspect gets "abandoned". 
---
The only aspects of the game unaffected by this problem are going to be the ones that either don't attract or don't allow dedicated communities. As such you'll see "casual" content receive "consistent" updates and communication, while everything else seemingly gets the neglect treatment. 
---
I urge you keep in mind that arenanet has been trying. Raids, fractals, wvw maps, spvp all have been attempts to create different content that allows for dedicated communities. Their shortcomings aren't due to incompetent devs (simply untrue), but due to a failure to adapt to/deal with communities.
---
This sub has always been kind of a salt mine and this was just the latest thing to direct the pitchforks at
---
I don't think pitchforks are really efficient for mining salt and this metaphor got away from me but my point is that people are still going to be like that even with any clarification
---
mightyteapot was a very prominent content creator (especially in regards to raiding) who is leaving the game because anet doesn't support raids and other content he plays enough (which is a valid complaint) and organized a large event called ERP which IIRC was a raiding tournament before he leaves. some ppl are throwing an autistic shitfit crying "the death of the game anet evil GRRR" because of of his departure and lack of anet support.
---
This, I mostly play the casual stuff because the hardcore stuff is better in other games so I don't have interest in gw2's version of "hardcore". It has become easier, more and more gold grinding and nothing new/engaging.
---
You realize most of the viewership consisted of people that barely play the game or not at all anymore? They just came for the hype and memes and to support the ones that actually made the effort to organize it in spite of Anet's refusal to give support.
---
&gt; i didn't, but can it get worse?
---
Yes. Twitch chat at least has the ability to be moderated, both manually and by filters and such. Games like LoL, CS:GO and such are full of pure, endless, unmoderated racism, bigotry and everything else you can or cannot even think of.
---
I specifically used physical TCGs, magic specifically, as an example where you are not actually forced to get into the gambling aspect of booster packs by buying individual cards. This is not the case for games with digital lootboxes without player marketplaces.
---
Well it is the most content GW2's gotten in months.
---
But the BM potential of using Mercy.
---
I agree, it's annoying we had nothing but idiotic nonsense of fluff and delusional anet whiteknighting in this sub.
---
So refreshing to see the circlejerk and countercirclejerk battle it out. At least there's variety and content in it. Better than another LOOK GUISE MY FIRST LEGUNDARY post by someone who uses their phone as screenshot button.
---
Yes, mighty teapot and top raiders are leaving the game for a while. Many people say it’s just a small part of the community, but qT, SC and Discretize build pages have made the community play a lot better, they have really helped us all to improve our skills.
---
I'll take a screenshot when I get home. Do you want to see the achievment?
---
That's a fair point, but if they had any intention of working with Teapot, they could have negotiated that with him. It's been ERP for the past few years, and the acronym has served to attract curious and bemused players to find out what it is, but the finale could have been styled differently. There couldn't have been much of an effort to collaborate if they didn't even try to sort something out, and the only sources sharing what Anet discussed with Teapot say nothing about the name.
---
I am not religious, but:
---
Amen.
---
I legitimately will have a solid zero level of surprise if August 30th turns out to be a GW mobile game and a console release (because they're hiring console programmers on the job listings...)
---
in summary a bunch of raiders are butthurt and you shouldn't worry about them
---
people are overreacting, Enjoy the game, this subreddit is the toxicity endgame you need to gear up before entering and comprehending it all. :D
---
the facts state something else, basically we had a raid like 2 months ago. Fake news you spread. Stop it
---
Good players pug indeed. For example when their group can't okay right now due to irl reasons or such
---
A lore event which was invented out of nothing because the original point of the game was guild vs guild PvP battles.
---
filling up holes through LFG is not the same as full time pugging
---
buddy, the games been dying slowly over years and Anet knows it. They're just been easing the game into it's grave.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/BoldPolishedHawkSuperVinlin 
---
MERCY
---
RUNE
---
IS
---
ENABLED
---
No needed. At least U can kill chap solo. Let’s Travel and make this event reach it main idea - support newbee and lonely player on Tyria. 2 player on one champ more than enough.
---
Anet was idiotic enough to ban Kripp in 2012, release mount gamble boxes during peak of EA annual controversy, bring to WvW mounts, feature that could be simply resolved by giving guardians movement trait, feeding community recycled content as "new refocus on GW2" and various shit like GW2 friendships and other controversy over the years...
---
But they are not so supporting of community to make food for people like Jim Sterling, Young Yea, etc to cover and promote ERP.
---
That's because of no downstate. And even then, they cleared all bosses within 30 minutes most of the time.
---
I would like to, would be an awesome gift for a friend of mine
---
Following NPCs after events ended to see the effect of the event on them and to see if there is another event chaining into it. It was awesome and something happened after most of the time.
---
I don't really do it anymore because most of the time the events are either part of the meta or just single events with no or little follow up.
---
There will always be a toxic group in games. It starts with hardcore players. Then they leave. Then it’s another group. And another. Eventually it’s the casual that called everyone toxic and to gtfo of the game that becomes the toxic one and told to gtfo. 
---
The community cannibalises itself eventually
---
Yeah, its kinda like when the showrunners of GoT got shit on for last season yet said fans forgot about the previous SEVEN seasons. Even if this live announcement is going a big hit, it will still be just a matter of time before someone finds another thing to shit on Anet. I am not against criticism, just against how some things are said by some people.
---
raids should die so the loud but small hardcore playerbase will leave and we can move on with living world
---
and GW2 will be what it was couple years ago. a game for casuals, with a stunning open world and friendly helpful community.
---
Oof, when even the guy you're fanboying for has to tell you to tone down the astroturfing.
---
i wonder how much views he would have gotten, if everybody had to pay a dollar to see it
---
You didn't like kung fu tea?
---
&gt; Raiders and fRaCtAL gOdS (not to be confused with the cool and generally chill people who actually own the title)
---
Kinda sounds like you're just filtering out all the people who don't fit your stereotype to make sure it still fits lol
---
The actual answer is people are just people, you get a big enough group you'll get some assholes. There's probably a higher concentration in competitive areas, but there are toxic people and regular people in all groups.
---
With "" I meant to summarize the comment. Wasn’t understood as intended. 
---
 
---
Criticism is good, but that that comment before was jut about hate not criticism. It’s not about hardcore Players vs casuals. But if you hate a game you probably shouldn’t play it.
---
No its not, youtubers and twitch streamers just pushing for views while hurting the game.
---
I am just casual players and I have no idea who is this MightyTeapot are and ERP stuff suddenly appeared on gw2 Reddit with so much drama over 17k viewer? 
---
What is this ERP? All I know ERP stands for erotic role play lol
---
BUT THAT IS STUPID!
---
whatever he has to say, he could have said it before the tournament, instead, he used it as a marketing strategy
---
Yeah, obviously I'm the delusional one for thinking that the game which forces you to go out into zones at every possible turn, which has a jumping puzzle and scavenger hunts in nearly every zone, and which passes out stat-selectable best in slot gear for doing enough meta-events *might* have a slight focus on world content.
---
I'm new, and sort of on and off. Can I ask why? and how? Was battling on what to mmo to main, With all this news, it's kinda making want to nope out
---
You’ve clearly never heard of OSRS lmao. And if you have then I’m surprised you’d be so skeptics, OsRS paved the way and showed us that even if a game is old doesn’t mean it won’t thrive. Do better man.
---
This.
---
This is why I do not my T4 but just the T3 daily
---
In World of Warcraft, it means the group is stucked and can't continue. They need to find a replacement, and if that in the middle of the Dungeons - this can be annoying.
---
I don't think "astroturfing" means what you think it means... I don't see how people complaining about lack of support from ANet is astroturfing.
---
Have you seen legendary runes UI? Or in-game mount selection?
---
Guild Wars 2 with current UI would be unplayable disaster on any console.
---
They cannot make everyone happy, but why do we have to hate on anything they improve/introduce into another game? Showing disappointment and providing constructive criticism is one thing (which also exists in these parts thankfuly), just hating on what the devs do and almost pray that the other game modes get nothing since "mine doesn't get either" is just unhealthy for the whole game.
---
The first few wings did, yeah, but after that? Bear in mind, there was almost a year between HoT and the start of LWS3 because of internal changes at Anet.
---
Not seeing living world getting 17k views on twitch :D
---
I just came back to the game after a ~1 year break and it seems there has been many changes to the mesmer (mainly nerfs from what I see :&lt;), but I'm not sure exactly what was changed.
---
Is there somewhere a compiled list of mesmer changes, that would spare me going through every single patch note ? Something like a change history maybe ?
---
Amen
---
Honestly curious. What future? Last time I checked they were still ignoring the equally hardcore part of warframe community.
---
I really hope they stop with more than 5 ppl instances content and just redu e all the raids to 5 men content and we can move on from this parenthesis which make ala the elitist jerk made so much loud in lfg
---
Yes, obviously you are. because even the so called open world content isn't as good as it could be, so why saying they are focused on it? They are focused on nothing, but milking what's left of the game.
---
Wow you sound so friendly. Such a friendly community that doesnt post non stop hate and QQ posts on reddit, love the friendliness!
---
ohhhhh, I get it then. You won't see what's wrong for a long time which is nice. I'd rather not say them, I like that they are filling that "time" between realization. And it has now become it's own game, but it still sucks for some people.
---
a die hard gw2 player will have all the currency stashed in their bank from their home instance nodes, like I did. 
---
We actually still moaning about this. I will be glad of 500 cooking just so I can read another topic :)
---
the only one delusional here is you.  "ERP" has a bad context in the mmo world. why would a mmo company associate themself with it these days with all the SJW and morons on the internet?
---
Still does not changed my pov, should he and other streamers have more back up? Yes that should be a part of their pr to reach other players. But regardless of that even if they were going to do that this year or not, it simply is not possible due to the addon.
---
I love it
---
I would love to pass this onto a guildie thats on a ftp account. If you still have it that is. Very kind of you. ty :)
---
&gt; doing tournaments=17k viewers
---
he got viewbotted btw:
---
And you absolutely are a casual player with unicorn in your ears and spend your whole life playing tetris *making a statement because i know you*
---
Thats kinda the general attitude at the moment. Criticism is not enough. You have to hate anet.
---
They have to, I've never understood why people expect a company that has to guard its own back legally and publicly to act like their coolest best friend and break the rules just for them.
---
It would of been good and Anet should of tried offering an alternative such as an invis dev inside the raid doing the camera work but then that's exceedingly involved on their part and there is a good chance the camera tool they use for trailers and such simply won't slot into the live build all easy like that and they definetly wouldn't want a developer using the third party tool.
---
A compramise could of been struck but I'm willing to bet fault lies on both sides, probably a lack of effort on Anets part and a lack of desire or idea for compromise with Anet from Teapot... That's just speculation though.
---
Don't worry for that at all, just a butthurt fanboys are spitting toxic waste around recently. 
---
This game got a lot of updates, features and QoL within last 4 months. We are getting another feature pack giving us cooking 500 tomorrow and big reveal of expansion-like FREE features and story coming this Friday. Regular players are hyped AF for everything that's coming right now. Also, devs give us more and more community events. SO many players in game right now!
---
Enjoy gw2 in its best (and still improving) state ever.
---
Are you new to reddit? Because there have been shit storms around arena net for less.
---
I don't believe there's even a chance of change in direction. From what I'm seeing I expect ANet to shift their focus on another project, delivering minor updates to GW2 primarily to keep the gemstore running.
---
One for every single character..
---
Cry babies wanted to break the rules AND have official support and the okay from Anet and moaned when they didn't get it.
---
Don't let it disaued you from playing the game regularly, just be aware how vastly this sub blows these things out of proportion.
---
&gt; ANet supported a competitive scene
---
Anet wanted the e-sport fame without putting in the effort and thought throwing money at it fixes everything. GW2 never had a proper scene or a thriving playerbase, only half a dozen teams tagging along for free money. Most people quit before 2013 because PvP was barely in beta state.
---
GW1 had a scene, a playerbase, and was a solid PvP game in general, that's the difference.
---
If its not against the ruels can you atleast make a megathread about anything teapot related, seeing 20 dif posts about him is kind of obnoxious and fills up the sub.
---
And that could have happen if Arena Net had such tool, they did not. Their tools was not good enough and there for your "they could have" is kind of not really valid since no they could not because they could not provide such thing. 
---
And again to make it clear, i am all for that Arena Net should support their partners better, but in this case it was made impossible and the shit storm of the year would turn up on reddit because arena net would break their own rules.
---
It would be curious to see if their own "big announcement" expected on 30th will get as many viewers. And it will be quite amusing when it doesn't.
---
Why 500 cooking destroyed my relationship.
---
Yeah and I'm one of them and I'm salty that they are adding almost none and the ones they do add look way worse compared to both vanilla and gemstore. And the ones that do look good are again gemstore outfits and not seperate armors.   
---
If they dedicated half of the resources to immersive armors that they do to the shiny ones we'd have nothing to talk about. but the fact that 95% of them are from the original, vanilla times and the new ones are even less fashion freindly than those speaks volumes. And that is not even going into the quality of the models and time invested compared to outfits.   
---
All in all take a hike with that dumb opinion, when we get 20 outfits in gemstore vs 1 subpar set in-game then there's a problem and one which people have been complaining about for years ESPECIALLY us vanilla-armor lovers.
---
GW2 = toxic casuals and elitists everywhere thinking that everyone else is toxic excluding them selves
---
GW2 community is a toxic shithole, but *not* because of the raiders.
---
Okay so... You took a break, new content got released and you're upset you need to catch up?  Is that a decent TL:DR?
---
At least you didn't have to regear yourself entirely. That's the true definition of a treadmill in games. Blade and Soul is a good example for this kinda thing. It's why I can't get back into it.
---
You NEED proper gear to properly enjoy new content in that game, GW2 doesn't have that. We've had the same levels of gear for years and that's what makes it so easy to hop in and out.
---
But the Griffon and Skyscale are supposed to be projects you work on for fun while you wait for the next content.... You really don't need them to play the game . They're nice to have, don't get me wrong .  But like the other mounts which just help with quality of life, you have other tools to get where you need to go .
---
High place? Springer.
---
Go fast? Raptor and Jackal.
---
Over water? Skimmer.
---
As for the 250 of everything: it's no different than anything else? You just work on it at whatever pace you see fit.
---
It took me a month to get my stuff, and I was fine with that.  I didn't want to drive myself insane . Don't set a time limit, it's like the legendary weapons where the journey is half the enjoyment. You should get your Griffon or Skyscale and think " wow, I did this! Go me! " 
---
A friend of mine got her Griffon and Skyscale hella " late" compared to others cause she worked overnights and she feels accomplished.   And guess what? She's now at the same level of playing field as someone who got the stuff earlier.  We're all in a content waiting period again. Waiting for the big announcement.
---
Telling people to fuck off in the first few lines doesn't make the best impression.  And you're going to get a lot of hate for it before people read your so-called "article". I'd calm down.
---
This comment is underrated, deserves so much more.
---
Yes! Do a raffle please
---
o7, was great memes, thanks for hosting this @staff and thank you all for tuning in
---
Why should he be banned? :D He did not use any hack by himself ... and the 2 streamers were using alts. I am sure this will make you extremely happy  haha ... btw pretty toxic comment. Especially when Anet has the possibility in the game but are just too lazy to support their most popular streamer and give him access to the tool so the event can be a lot more interesting to watch.
---
&gt; You're talking to actual human beings on the other end, and **unlike you**, at the end of the day **they have value** and respect.
---
Calling people worthless in the middle of your paragraph about good community and respectful communication.
---
Classy
---
Sjeez man, calm your tits. Who hurt you in life to become so cynical? All I’m saying is that there is way more than 2 hours worth of content in a LS episode and you are purposely misinforming new players because you’re just salty...
---
&gt; When other MMO community was fighting each other over who's elitism is the best, our community were just a happy family. But then ArenaNet decided: actually, we will have raids, esports, and elitism in our community.  
---
??????  
---
&gt; And when you finish the story version of a dungeon you unlock
---
the explorable version of that dungeon. Those are intended to be the super hard, very coordinated group style content like Slavers Exile, or Fissure of Woe, or the Underworld.  
---
[interview from 2011 before the gw2 release](https://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/gw2-interview-with-colin-johanson-on-dungeons-and-underwater-content). basically dungeons were supposed to be what raids are now. the "hard" team content.  
---
do you also remember underworld, fissure of woe, domain of anguish, the deep, urgoz warren from guild wars 1? do you remember all the dungeons from there? the speedrun community from gw1? PvP, GvG. what anet was back with gw1 then and what happend in gw2 after launch?  
---
did you sleep under a fucking rock?
---
There was no good way to spectate. This event wouldn't be possible without it. And also I'd say that there's a difference between using it to get an advantage like spying on the enemy server in comparison to using it in instance, a closed environment that benefits noone.
---
Tencent Arc
---
lol any sources to read about that? I'm fully ready to go down a rabbit hole
---
Really? Baffling? Cant think of any reason why build templates in GW1 weren't copied to GW2?
---
Imo there is fundamental problem to horizontal progression. It has deminishing returns, as first legendary has much higher value to a player than second legendary has. Because of this, they need to introduce some form of vertical progression from time to time. In HoT in was masteries while in PoF it is mounts. Previously it was exotic into ascended, i am not sure when stat infusions were introduced, but this is also a form of vertical progression.
---
There is another thing which a game developer has to consider, when it comes to different types of players in the community, which are based on content type they develop, like OP described. Hardcore players are the ones who drive the game further, are demanding and critical, while players who jump into the game from time to time to check what is new, will also jump into another game just like that. MMO needs to have a mixure of players, that is what creates a virtual world which evolves over times, content vise, community vise. Imo without introduction of raids and dedicated support classes in HoT, game would slowy die off, while putting leggy armor behind the raid was a very poor decision.
---
There isn't even enough meaningful content for casual players tbh. I played this game for close to 7 years and have "only" 750 hours spend, the majority before fractals and raids were even a thing. I recently got back to the game after quitting when PoF released and there is still nothing new I can do to advance my character. Once you got full ascended there is nothing to go for anymore if you don't like/care about legendaries. Maybe it's just me but for me a RPG's longevity came from the steady character progression. You do content to get better gear to do harder content to get even better gear to do even harder content.
---
Chronomancers now get new shatters (distortion and continuum split are the same F4 skill now). All chronomancer shatters require a clone and don't do the effect from your location. Mimic's cooldown is increased based on what skill it reset. Signet of Inspiration increases the duration of boons already on players. Trait in Inspiration causes SoI to hit 10 targets. SoI cooldown lowered, well of recall reduced to 25 sec CD to match action. Tides of time applies quickness on the way out and alacrity on the way in. Moa signet CC reduced from 1000 to 600, tides can't multi-hit large targets. Mimic not affected by continuum split. 
---
Main changes off the top of my head (some are pretty old so you may have seen them already). Besides the addition of diviner gear to [the build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power%20boon/) the [basic rotation](https://youtu.be/H1154AbvI34) hasn't changed in raids for ~6 months now. The loss of free distortion is pretty big and the changes really finished off chrono in fractals (no CS without targets = worse pre-stacking) though they were already being replaced with firebrand + renegade.
---
What I never said they had such a tool, I'm saying anet could've asked teapot to say it was their tool so noone would know it was a 3rd party program. But they indeed have such a tool, the "hack" teapot used, gave him access to this tool.
---
No matter howmuch you hate TP or like Anet, it's just wrong to not be against Anet on this one because they're 100% in the wrong for acting like little kids.
---
&gt; Are we all just forgetting the World Tournament Series and Pro League?
---
Can we? They were a joke. Zero effort nonsense.
---
depending on the announcement
---
You're complaint is that in my post i didnt make specify that im talking about myself, not my fault you cant figure out that when people makes posts its from their own perspective. Actually there isnt, egg hunts and face rolls meta bosses hardly count as "content". If you want actual endgame content GW2 isnt the game for you. I like how you dont try to dispute that these rolls around on 4 month and 9 month intervals though, clearly im just salty....
---
Okay pops
---
Season 5 reveal I think, could be wrong though.
---
Who knows. Maybe it was a wakeup call for them.
---
Most of the hardcore raid community is leaving the game for either classic WoW or Final Fantasy. This event showed a lot of that. Snofify was a merge from snowcrows and quantify to get enough people together. Downstate cucks was just an assembly of streamer (8from NA and 2 from EU) who barely even played together before and originally didn't even plan to participate as mela said in his stream. Plebs in the void was also just an assembly of people from EU sell guilds.
---
Casual raiding will prevail but it will be a lot harder getting the rotations and benchmarks down. Hopefully lucky noobs will take over.
---
would be enough if we could get a tome for all the passkeys imho
---
GvG dead and buried and zero support for the ERP. Guilds LUL.
---
&gt; If I quit, you'll be worse from it as well. 
---
Tonight, before I go to bed, I'll make sure to shed a tear for you.
---
Man, that was interesting. Just finished answering the questions, waiting for the results!! 😁😁
---
We are talking about ArenaNet.
---
&gt; PoF made me lose interest in the game. It got formulaic, boring and stale. 
---
This became a trend in late LS3 as well. Early-mid HoT was basically the best thing GW2 could ever have. Lots of new features, fresh content (rip WvW though), lots of players. Everything after that was just a major snooze fest across all game modes.
---
I want the novelty hotkey tho
---
&gt;I also have my internal "idiot rating" of "do not join groups"
---
Atleast he isnt a toxic player who excludes people for arbitrary reasons right?
---
is it about me and you or me and you + the salt discord? seems you have no backbone and need back-up. I am here to argue with you 1v1. I gain absolutely nothing in posting on that shit ass discord, besides the other clowns there jumping on me. having a backbone doesnt mean being stupid.
---
actually it's making a zone every 9-12months, they have 3 dev teams that each do an episode in order. The quality for 9-12months of work is REALLY suboptimal. IMO this is fully to blame that the current devs don't have the same passion for gw2 as the devs did long ago, can be cause they got added to it so they weren't with anet from the start, got placed to another team so it's not the content they want to work on, or they've been working for anet for 7years now and want to move to something new because. but rn they just go with let's make it big and flashy so it looks amazing the first time you do it, but is mediocre every time after that.
---
Great, my post is up 5 seconds and it's already downvoted to hell. 
---
Amazing when people don't even take the time to read.
---
Anet was in the chat, and they even commented. MikeO was also there and commented for everyone to see.
---
They didn't ignore the event, but they had most likely trouble supporting it as they used some harsh camerahack to make the spectate experience better. Anet probably could not support that, but it's good they also don't seem to ban anyone for it.
---
what ill be doing is general mapping of the (english, and maybe polish) internet, not breaking 1 community down under the microscope. the very nature of this project forces me to generalise. and it wont be "twitch is bad", more like "twitch consists of communities x y z" and then describing them. my original comment was a half-joke
---
Ah yes, that shameful enterprise resource planning. How dare they want to associate with that
---
It's funny you would say that, because I think you know I'm right. 
---
A game is only as strong as its community. Being an asshole will only be fun until the day you can't anymore.
---
Take what I say with a grain of salt because I don't  play this game anymore, but I think people are unhappy with anets pace when releasing new content. The only thing they do fast is put new skins in the gemstore and maybe living story updates which are \~2 hrs of content (every 3? months)  if you don't do all the achievements. For other content like raids/fractals you're looking at 6-8 months between updates which dont take very long to complete either.
---
All that being said I think it's a great game if you're just starting out and you're going to enjoy it atleast until you reach the point where you complete pretty much everything.
---
Good bot.
---
I don't know. The new zone is pretty awesome, in a lot of ways. Not just in looks but design. I thought Thunderhead Peakes had some good design too.  And I was talking about how often they deliver a zone, not how long it takes to make it. I'm aware it takes longer.  I'm just saying that they're not sitting around lazily doing nothing, or taking the easy way out, and they're not.
---
Thanks for being weird.
---
250 currencies that you would have if you played at least one week casually 2 hours a day on each released map when it released. Of course you hate the grind if you push through 15 months of content in two days!
---
&gt; I hope you never had to go through the struggle of unlocking characters in beat'em up games.
---
Oof how I hated playing Smash Bros to unlock the characters - and then I even had to fight them in order to unlock them. Who came up with that stupid idea? \s
---
&gt;When other MMO community was fighting each other over who's elitism is the best, our community were just a happy family.
---
Hahahaha what community were you part of?
---
It's still a lame excuse. These are important features. Certainly far more important than the ability to pop a chair out of your behind and attach yourself to it.
---
lol
---
But why would they be interested in the first place? Especially with W7 not delivering and most of the players being committed to other games now.
---
anything is better than them not even supporting those
---
If you dont think that the multi million dollar corporation contributing to an ingame event created by their own players showcasing their ingame content would have made no difference. Then that says more about the competency for Anet's staff than anything else
---
Exactly. At this point I'm surprised Anet doesn't forget to pay the electric bills for the servers.
---
That's not paying for the game three times, you fucking idiot. That's paying for the game and also the two expansions. You can still just buy the one.
---
I really like the [sanctuary runes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_Sanctuary) and I think they are highly underrated. You get  a barrier for ANY heals received (exceptions are passive heals and some traitlines which would get really OP if they worked, I guess). You know these nasty attacks, that one shot you out of nowhere in big open world events? Say no more, because all the AoE healings you receive stack up a barrier shield for you. :)
---
Most of the time I still use schoolar runes in PvE, because of the DPS (and people want you to have the meta builds, ect.) but sanctuary runes boost your defenses tremendously. Especially, if you play a build with lots of active heals yourself.
---
I even got my own little "hidden OP" build in sPvP abusing this rune. ;)
---
Yeah, but did he create new items for the gem store? No?! There you have it! It's about priorities.
---
/s
---
I've got no problem with people wanting a meta comp and KP for 99/100 CM.
---
Pepple wanting to get on thst ladder can find training groups for those in LFG and in public guilds ilke Mistlocked.
---
So people who want to do CMs with kp, because they don't have time to do a Trainings run everyday, are idiots? Nice
---
Agreed, gw2 has the most amazing community I’ve seen in a game. I’m regularly blown away by it.  
---
I’m genuinely confused as to what interactions you could be seeing
---
Much appreciated. It's an interesting topic and gets more interesting as technology develops. It reminds me of the movie Ready Player One. It's a  minutiae, but I wouldn't turn the game off twice a week. Ha
---
Did you say 1.5 million player.
---
My boyfriend is casual to end-game-curious and he doesn't find the casual content engaging anymore. I do, but I tend to have the patience to work towards long-term goals and use gw2 in conjunction with YouTube for my entertainment. 🤷 
---
So yeah, even the casual content needs to get better.
---
Probably a fake MikeO.
---
diablo mobile. probably not gonna happen (or at least not gonna be the main event for gw2 players)
---
also you're not the first to suggest this.
---
gem store sales pay their bills. I doubt that Teapot referred many new customers to gw2 during the ERP with his twitch community constantly bashing Anet with memes and hateful comments
---
What happened at the end?
---
Probably, i must say im not sure. But benp was real as far as i can tell.
---
not gonna happen. always have a good laugh when reading the ego inflated BS from you clowns. :)
---
&gt; The problem isn't Anet or Teapot, the problem is Teapot's incel army that knows neither nuance nor reason or rationality and just blindly bashes their bullshit and are a cancer and a blight upon the land, the game and this subreddit. Without them, we're all better off.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; That's why people are glad to see Teapot gone. Not because of him. Because of the howling morons that follow in his wake and are nothing but hate and memes and unresolved trauma.
---
Completely agree. Kudos to teapot and the other organizers to make this thing happen.
---
However, he completely failed in fostering a good community for the game.
---
You can't really expect guild support in a game called guild wars.
---
You never did any dungeon SC or GvG or HoH I take it?
---
They'll 'sponsor' it when they need the shit out of the professions LN used come next balance patch 🙃
---
Not even a reTweet. 
---
Selfcucking at its best.
---
&gt;I've learned to adapt my expectations in a way where anet cant really disappoint me.
---
the true endgame
---
Like I said, they weren't perfect, but ANet did support a competitive GW2 scene. Claiming otherwise is just nonsense. It just wasn't *the* scene PvE people wanted.
---
"YoUr OpIniOn Is OffEnDiNg MeEeEeEe!" :'D
---
It's okay, how you wrote it. And now we let the offended be offended.
---
Same
---
I'm sharing my experience with the service. Just because service works, it doesn't make it fine by definition. I don't think you can comprehend this, since you don't know the difference between product and service.
---
Arena Net tried at launch with the PvP scene. They threw money at it, and it didn't pay off. 
---
It fundamentally comes down to the developers being reluctant/unwilling to develop tools for the players to use to make the scene thrive. Their competency IS in question and it seems, internally, there are many staff stubborn in their ways and unwilling to admit their approach just sucks.
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/
---
ERP also stands for Erotic RolePlay.
---
I was actually really much into fow and uw speedclears, but the community was so much more helpful.  I remember HoH having the rank requirement for people, but there were much more guilds recruiting new players. Cant say it for GvG.
---
It's exactly the kind of thing for "just this once". Also I heard they have developers, just give the pleb a free camera for two days in exchange for 20k viewers and then put his account back to normal ffs ez marketing. Or is reworking a hack way too complicated for them? Yeah erp wouldn't be possible cause their free cam would need 5 months beta to be usable at all
---
It really does.
---
There's plenty of helpful training guilds that people like you seem to ignore though. 
---
If people weren't leeching and begging for carrying, why would they want to join highly experienced groups instead of joining groups of their own skill level and interests?
---
You haven't shared anything, you just keep saying "game bad game shit"
---
Your original point was that Anet is milking money out of people, yet you haven't demonstrated *how.* The last "mandatory" paid service was released **two fucking years ago** and has been on sale regularly since.
---
I only watched because it was free. It was a good event though.
---
Also, even people from statics can pug (a lot). There are little guilds that do multiple FC weekly for your alt accounts and you may pug for them. People in the best guilds are not focused on FC either and can spend multiple evenings training the same boss, if you want to FC you may want to pug as well.
---
best show? the erp was a clownfiesta for the most part (except ln and sT), an entertaining clownfiesta however
---
&gt; Your original point was that Anet is milking money out of people, yet you haven't demonstrated how.
---
Why do you think they are releasing skins in gemstore? For you to get them with gold? Don't be ridiculous.
---
I suggest to you taking your own advice - don't like my comments? Ignore them. Reddit gives you an option to block me. Be an example before suggesting things to others.
---
Not sure what would be more disappointing, a mobile game or a card game announcement
---
Ironically, t3 tends to be harder IMHO because you will always play with people that can not handle t4 yet, which means there is an higher gap between the player levels that the gap between the difficulty of t3 vs t4
---
Raids have dedicated training discord servers and fractals have plentiful “anyone welcome”. The only people who moan that “raids are toxic for inexperienced players” are the ones who want to leech kills because attending a training raid requires them to put in effort.
---
But you don't have to buy those. You don't have to buy anything, which brings us right back around to my point that everyone here already owns the game and doesn't have to spend another dime if they don't want to.
---
So... why are you here telling people how bad you think the game is?
---
Every "toxic" guild you talk about did more to making raids accessible for new players than you.
---
However, people like you believe that making raids accessible means free fare for raid rewards.
---
No-one who saw the way this community behaved at this event said to themselves "I want in on that, they seem like dead people". The "GW2 IS DED" spam in chat, the celebration threads over the viewer numbers spitefully saying "great middle finger to ArenaNet", the constant scapegoating of players of other game modes (many who also raid) as the reason raids don't get more content. 
---
This event was like taking a photo of your toilet the morning after a big night of drinking and tacos, then getting diarrhea and using that photo to sell your house. No-one is going to find that appealing no matter how nice the porcelain is.
---
You actually want to showcase a community that is welcoming, enjoying themselves, celebrating the game and each other. Optimistic about the future and the present. I would take the taxi promotion over this every day of the week. Spite just isn't attractive.
---
hahaha funny thing is that people are talking the same about World of Warcraft, because of it's "bad expansion BfA" LOL
---
Because I'm a customer and I find it my duty to share my experience with the service I paid for.
---
No. I'm not generalizing. I didn't say that it was the usual thing. Maybe my English skills are not perfect. But what I meant was that it happens again and again, it's typical. And that doesn't mean that there are not other typical forms of communication and social behaviors on Twitch. It just means that this is one of the typical forms and it's something more of a thing with smaller channels/communities.
---
The original release cadence of the initial wings, alongside the quality of the Wing-5 release, speak to the contrary. This game has proven itself capable already, but hasn't been able to keep up.
---
Same, I've played for 2 years and never stepped foot in one. Probably the biggest barrier to entry in raids is just being able to learn the fights in a convenient way whilst braving the wrath of the raging experienced raider who only wants experienced players for fast efficient clears. As much as WoW players deplore LFR and multiple raid difficulties along with the ingame raid guide, it's a great way of teaching the basics of boss mechanics, whilst there are dozens of quality video and written guides for harder difficulties to make teaching easier.
---
But you still haven't shared anything. You just keep saying the game is bad.
---
That's 100% unrelated. 
---
ArcDPS reads what's going on in combat and it's allowed.
---
And if you want to go that route, any third party program then shouldn't be allowed since they interact with the game.
---
Not linking the builds of the actual winners: [https://lucky-noobs.com/klassenuebersichten/](https://lucky-noobs.com/klassenuebersichten/)
---
They're saying the toxic shithole is the raid community.
---
It's about every 2 months. Newest set atm is Bioluminescent weapon set
---
The thing about no one coming to.shadow behemoth. Barely anyone does pre events, and it's not new either. I remember seeing that in 2014. 
---
When it comes to world bosses, people have done them so much they go brain dead while doing them, they probably at least have music on, if not TV or YouTube videos. I probably wouldn't revive you either, not because it's not worth my time or something like that, but I don't see you since I'm not paying any attention besides the bare minimum.
---
not my problem that your hazelnut brain cant comprehend the images I posted and the fact that an older stream of him got viewbotted in the same way before.
---
and again: where is your proof that it wasnt viewbotted. I have evidence. you have nothing, but idiotic answers and a group of meme clowns on discord where you can whine about me.
---
Only anecdotal, but I only watched it because I planned to take a break before PoF, but never ended up coming back to the game.  The ERP announcement popped up on my reddit home page, so I ended up checking out the tournament because I wanted to see the wings I never got to see and ended up continuing to watch because it was really good fun.  Whilst sometimes I think I oughta at least play through PoF and the LW I've not seen, I have no plans to ever be an active player again.
---
So yeah, what others said.  This was interest in an event and a last hurrah for others, not some sign the game is super healthy.
---
Nah. Those three have similar enough environments that they could no doubt borrow a good portion of assets from earlier releases. Cantha, however, has a wildly different environment in every sense, so the gross majority of these art assets would need to be created for the first episode alone.
---
If they were to have had a feature pack or something similar release between S4 and S5 (something I think they should do after every third release anyways just to give 2-3 more months of development, esp. in the middle since it's fairly notable that the first half has more work put into it), then I could see it as potentially feasible, especially if the first episode was located in Tyria and segued into Cantha for Episode 2.
---
I mean, outside this kind of special events he averaged 500 twitch viewers, which is bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the barrel. practically a complete nobody.
---
and then he only got this kind of numbers because this event got associated with the part of the community that wants to "stick it to the man"...and also bots. lots and lots of bots
---
&gt; Second of all, people are not "idiots" because they want a druid.
---
i don't know about that, sounds debatable
---
Teapot himself on the ERP discord
---
&gt; Arena Net tried at launch with the PvP scene. They threw money at it, and it didn't pay off. And they have made no indication they've changed their view of how to handle competitive scenes.
---
Hm, i wonder why, maybe it has to do with how pvp had literally no features whatsoever any decent game would have called beta instead, or maybe had to do with the glacial balance changes that didn't change any meta and it was done biyearly, oh no, i'm sure the community was at fault :)
---
You guys are probably pro by now. :)
---
For the event? No one.
---
So casuals are the embodiment of evil? This sub really hit a low with the ERP and the constant need for drama following it, feels like it's everyone vs everyone.
---
Cant deny that, for me li and kp parties are cancer same dudes trying to sell raid clear, lol I would even support banning that kond of players.
---
They have a reason to be negative about their gamemode...the same way WvW players do, PvP players do, and OW players do, Lore enthusiasts do, and ultra casuals for a wide range of things do.
---
So, blaming a community for negativity is plain stupid. If you have a problem with their negativity (doesn't matter which community), then argue the points they make specifically. Which, in most cases than not, are far more valid (supported by reasoning and constructive criticism) than what the ultra casuals complain about (reeeeeee more skins behind rng).
---
Aww, thanks. I still lurk here pretty reliably. Things are going great, actually - I had a very nice "summer off", something I haven't experienced since high school, so I am refreshed and ready to go and will hopefully have something lined up soon!
---
I deleted all of mine because they're soulbound so if this update happens, they better send me a new one.
---
Well, depending on your display name and how you got to it, it wouldn't be impossible for having someone else with the same account name as your main account. 
---
I've seen people with the same account name as mine, once, but i wouldn't be surprised if there were more. That's why i'm using a 0 in my reddit name as well.
---
Four to six times a year. It heavily depends on the released content. The next set is more or less imminent.
---
&gt;&gt; ANet supported a competitive scene
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Anet wanted the e-sport fame without putting in the effort and thought throwing money at tournaments fixes everything. GW2 never had a proper scene or a thriving playerbase, only half a dozen teams tagging along for free money. Most people quit before 2013 because PvP was barely in beta state.
---
&gt;GW1 had a scene, a playerbase, features like public spectator mode for tournaments, and was a solid PvP game in general, that's the difference.
---
Most people did not quit pre-2013.
---
GW2, pre-HoT, had a very active and engaged PvP scene. There was a thriving amateur community. I should know; I ran a number of amateur tournaments which had a decent number of players. Then the was the ESL weekly tournaments (Thursday and Sunday) and WTS which led to the Pro League.
---
GW1 had some nice features for PvP for sure, and ANet could have done more (as with all these things), but GW2 did have a competitive scene which was supported by ANet. It just wasn't the type of competitive scene all the PvE warriors wanted.
---
Anet: 
---
The Community: "PLEASE DON'T MAKE GW2 MOBILE!!!!"
---
Thanks for the explanation. So Teapot is quitting because Anet didn't support this community even he had or what? I just don't get it. Sure they could lend some support or prizes, but also... it's a community event. They don't have to step in. And if I understand it correctly, Teapot used some sort of glitch to stream it or something which Anet is not cool with? Because that makes complete sense to me...
---
&gt; but the developers haven't been able to keep up with the demand.
---
And they never will. It is very very very obviously not their primary focus.
---
If your main focus on mmos are raiding and hard content you're really doing yourself a disservice by limiting yourself to GW2. This is not a hill you want to die on.
---
Sub: "no, I don't think I will"
---
It takes a phenomenal amount of cognitive dissonance to claim that people lack nuance whilst simultaneously making sweeping statements and categorisations of people by referring to them as an 'incel army', whilst shutting down any contending viewpoints by dismissing it as 'blindly bashing their bullshit'. 
---
Please tell me this isn't a genuine, good faith belief. Given the comically exaggerated vitriol when you use words like 'a cancer and a blight upon the land', I can only assume this is emotional hyperbole.
---
Every cloud has a silver lining.
---
Honeslty he should have said that on stream when he saw the shitshow that was going on in chat.
---
Nonetheless, big thanks to him for the organization (and roy for the energy). My god was that final a beautiful match.
---
Pretty much history repeating itself. Obviously not the first time this happened seeing how it's the third. Back then it gained many viewers too and people meme'd the same things they are now. It's just worse now because he's going out with a bang on top of all this.
---
Bfa is bad but at least it has a lot of content, not 10 hours every 4 months. And you know expansion will be coming next year, while gw2 will be getting another living world updates with nothing to do in them.

Nono, he's leaving because after 7 years the content ANet delivers is not what interests him to the degree it did anymore, namely "challenging raids/encounters". ANet not supporting the event has no part in that, but ANet not supporting his style of play in the degree he'd need to keep up his motivation has.
---
I raid all the time.
---
Those complaining about other's toxicity are some of the most ignorant people in gaming i've ever met.
---
Astroturfing is when you pay people to pretend to be grass roots support for something. You think people are being paid to hate on arenanet for this?
---
There was a point, years ago, that GW2 did not have anyone at end game "inspiring" new players. People still played the game, because it was/is fun.
---
Bioluminescent weapons look rly good btw, if you haven't checked yet
---
I was wondering whether or not that was intentional.
---
ANet's always been selective as fuck with enforcing their rules, I don't see why they have to buck the trend now.
---
Nah he said he would still be in game if it had more regular raid releases (even without the challenge like the last one) or group content in the open world. 
---
Anet chose to do neither (look at the last living story episode, it isn't group world content. It is impossible to fail face roll content)
---
I make the distinction because people get hung up on the idea of a person pushing for hardcore content. When it is more someone pushing for mid tier content.
---
Anet: Act civil kids.   Players: Fuck YOU! Biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch. \~Frog meme\~
---
Hahaha. Dummies.
---
&gt;In political science, it is defined as the process of seeking electoral victory or legislative relief for grievances by helping political actors find and mobilize a sympathetic public, **and is designed to create the image of public consensus where there is none**.
---
Sounds pretty fitting to me.
---
if that is true, which i do not want to say since i have no idea about, that is still not a ressource problem.  
---
anet does have the ressources. the question is: how are they getting used.  
---
anet not having the ressources to support their gamemodes is one of the biggest lies ever.
---
Like this one ex reality stars twitter, right?
---
my guess for friday: 10 minutes generic talk, 30 min LS5 showcase, 5 min qol stuff.
---
after this pvp/wvw/raid/fotm will be dead and the openworld community can live happily alone in a dying and irrelevant game
---
It's obnoxious how some people can't stand the idea that there is an audience for hardcore content in this game.
---
But screw it, what's your favorite quaggan, fam?
---
If I remember correctly, something was said that Anet has (for long time) policy that such events can be supported when they have minimum of 8 teams competing, which was not the cause there. However better to wait for Teapot's full word on all of that.
---
&gt; Remember how they keep saying shit like build templates or programming weapons to be dyable is almost impossible for them? 
---
But the community did actually pull off build templates with an arcdps plugin iirc
---
wasnt it already declared a dead and insignifaicant game by you guys? how was it to be hardcore in such a bad game? :D
---
More like 10 minutes generic talk, 30 minutes about living season history, 5 minutes of new stuff.
---
As I said, ANet doesn't deliver on what he needs to keep up his motivation and interest.
---
Smart play on Anet though. Imagine the Shitstorm...
---
I dont' get the joke.
---
How is it to get milked by the gamstore on a weekly basis?
---
Let's say his corpse didn't rot to much in the ice.
---
Wasn't guild wars 2 originally made with hardcore pvp in mind, the sole reason why they tried to push e-sports so hard in the first place?
---
Honestly it seems like all you want is a single player experience, and not an mmo. May i recommend skyrim? Very easy to play, i think you would enjoy it :) How fucking delusional can a person be.
---
I am quite sure you guys have been saying the game has been dead for around 5 years now. Must be the most active dead game ever.
---
&gt; unskippable cutscenes
---
now there is a lesson that they have never learned.
---
I agree that the reason is insanely petty, but what are some of the worse names you've seen?
---
&gt; and the disbelief is completely reasonable because almost any criticism of the game is downvoted into oblivion 
---
There is a reason why I pointed out the positivity in the chat in the title of this post, and yet we're still talking about other things in the comments. It's too bad, I really wanted to talk about how wholesome this all was, and yet here we are. And I totally understand why.
---
Well /u/TehOwn beat me to it actually, but they replied to me instead of you:
---
&gt; You don't swap gear in GW1. You had several weapon swaps (4 or 5) and the build templates just changed your stats (which were way way simpler) and your skills. There were no traits.
---
&gt; Also, when GW2 came out, you had to visit a city and pay coin to change your trait build. In GW1, you can't change your build at all outside of towns or outposts.
---
The importance of the first point is that they couldn't just copy-paste build templates from GW1. GW1 attributes were 9 numbers from 1 through 12, that's it. Gear played nearly no role in your stats, and templates didn't control your gear anyway. GW1 build templates did not interact with your inventory. GW2 build templates would have to. ArcDPS is a wonderful tool, but it's also a hack, an ugly hack that breaks every update and needs to be patched. It's also unintuitive enough that ANet wouldn't want to ship it as-is in their game. 
---
The importance of the second point is that they didn't include build templates from the start because they didn't think people would be switching their builds constantly. I think this was a dumb decision (especially since they went through this in GW1 with build respec points) and I'm glad they reversed it, but the fact remains that they didn't dedicate time to build templates before the game released, and ever since then it's something that would need a significant amount of work for essentially a QoL feature. They clearly dedicate some time to QoL features, we get updates with them pretty regularly, and we're now getting build templates. You might have prioritized build templates over some other things, ANet didn't (and honestly considering how much traits have changed from the launch of the game, it makes sense that they wouldn't want to devote that much time designing a system that would have been broken a few times by now). 
---
Also, what are you talking about "staple requirement for a decade"? Does WoW even have templates outside of PvP? I know Rift had them when I played, but you had to pay real money to unlock more slots, and it was the only way to respec your build without paying gold every time so it was less about build templates and more about being able to alter your build at all. I have no idea about FF and ESO, but frankly I haven't heard anyone else say "but these MMOs have it!" so I kinda doubt they have build templates either. Everyone always brings up GW1. Am I missing something here, has every other MMO besides GW2 had build templates for the last 10 years?
---
And this guy calling me snitch for proving him wrong, meanwhile he does this himself ahahah
---
I have far too little info to answer that question, that's why I'm even asking what the hell is happening. But they would go broke in no time if they put in money for every community event in existance. I didn't played for the last couple of months but when I followed the news back when I did, I remember many community events. Some had some prizes donated by Anet, some didn't. Idk about the state of things these days. But flipping over for a thing like this seems silly to me.
---
Why? Because I am exposing you clowns? I Hope A-Net will put the chat in Subscriber only mode for friday.
---
I don't remember any elitist saying "go play goat simulator instead of afking in LA". It's you who are toxic, not them. Constantly name calling people and telling them to go away because they play the content you don't like and probably cant even play.
---
FFXIV has a higher population with mandatory sub fees. They squeeze out a handful of dungeons and ~8 raid bosses per year, PvP is an afterthought, and world content generally just doesn't exist.
---
WoW has a much higher population with semi-mandatory sub fees. They squeeze out ~10 raid bosses, one dungeon, and two new zones per year, PvP is an afterthought, and world content is generally dogshit.
---
Given the budget they're working with, I've never really been displeased with Anet.
---
Correct.
---
This is very important thank you.
---
Bounties could also have been a “hunt” instead of just got to X and kill boss. It would have been so much more interesting if there had been some teamwork involved in hunting down the targets and tracking them, so to speak. They’re very brainless how they ended up.
---
dont you people have phones?
---
Really? twitch chat spam makes u mad?
---
One person=the entire community
---
Glad you setting the examples for all the casuals too fam :)
---
"Casual" doesn't fit. I play raids once a week, so I'm a casual. We need a new word for openworld+story people.
---
Talk to this NPC to re-buy it: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Birthday_Vendor
---
nice try, but I havent spend anything on the game in the last 3 years.
---
and what has that to do with anything anyway? you are not better than OP with your constant comments on everything slighty critical on the hardcore playerbase.
---
I mean the game isn't dead because teapot is leaving. Teapot is leaving BECAUSE the game is dead due to the insanely stupid update and company policy at anet to not give a single shit about what players actually want, develop what ever the heck in the background and fail MISERABLY at it so that they have to lay off a lot of staff and refocus on a project that should have been there focus all the way along. Then shuffling back and forth teams created even more delay and here we are. The only updates we get regularly since YEARS are gem store items that are getting more and more abstruse to get people to whip out their credit cards. I'm only playing this game anymore because I have lots of time invested in it and remember the really fun times. I hope anet gets their shit together, but I guess they never will.
---
Most of the community is already gone
---
Yep, will get mine in about 6 months or so, and was thinking I'd have to dedicate a Shared Inventory slot for it.  Of course it also means I won't have to bother carrying around any open world food /might just replace my portable provisioner cube.
---
They call themselves casuals here though. It's not anyone's view.
---
and you're better by trying to shut down anything that criticises the game? 
---
also good support if you haven't spent anything in 3 years
---
are you saying the tens of thousands of viewers who watched the tourney aren't *akshually* part of the community?
---
also "anet bad" posts have always been a thing
---
Imagine catering to people who don't gaf in an mmo.
---
When they rolled the wing, teapot had an introduction video for each wing where the mechanics for each boss where listed and breifly explained and during the fight teapot often asked his second caster to explain what the players need to do, where they might fail. they even explained the comps the teams used. so in my opinion it should have been easy to follow for someone who has little to no raid experience
---
That's half or more of the average GW2 twitch numbers though.
---
You could always make you own parties though.
---
Those are literally the worst
---
I'm sick of every gaming company under the sun falling for the gaming trends of the year and trying to force it upon their game even if it doesn't suit their game at all.
---
That all started because the 'trendy' phrase in gaming a few years ago was 'E-sports' and everybody from FPS games, to MOBAs, to MMORPGs were trying to host competitive PvP competitions.
---
The Fashion trap is another trendy thing that this game fell into, mostly because this game is forced to make fashion important due to the unimportance of gear (exotic / ascended are easy enough to get that the only real option for endgame progression is fashion or buying QoL upgrades)
---
The problem with fashion is that almost every other mmo already has some kind of transmog / cosmetic system, and while Anet does good with fashion, it is in no way unique to them and looking better has no mechanical effect on the game. Hell, I've been playing old school runescape lately and they call it "fashion scape," so "fashion wars 2" is hardly a reason to play gw2, **ESPECIALLY** when gem store items often look competitive with legendaries in terms of detail and design, fashion wars 2 has become nothing more than an expression of the size of your wallet.
---
I'm hopeful for gw2, but considering how out of touch Anet is with their playerbase I wouldn't be shocked if the big surprise on August 30th was a battle royale, a legacy server, or some kind of mobile / console integration.
---
You (not you specifically) have to come up with your own builds, rotations, and use the big brain in your skull now to workout the intensely "complex" GW2 build craft-ing system. The horror!
---
mimimimimimimimi
---
you should get some medicine for such amount of butthurt
---
Appreciate the moderator team for allowing people to hype up and get excited about the tournament!
---
"First, if you are here to make some trash post like "cry more" or "git gud", please, fuck off. :)" i aint saying that, just u be lazy or have other priorities. the only thing that bothers me in this game is time gating. I am aware of  burnout issues and i am understanding, let this be their biigest fault. I loved gw1, love gw2, they ruined for others mmos, cause i find gw2 to be the closest thing to a FAIR GAME.
---
Happened the same with wvw and mount. Good luck.
---
You get like 1 wing with 3-4 bosses every year and this has been their schedule for the entirety of the latest expansion (which came out 3 years ago). This is absolute snail's pace compared to any other mmo. The reality is they will never release raids at the pace that people want it.  If it was going to happen it would be happening already. There's obviously not that much actual demand for them to focus their resources on raiding.
---
If you care about raiding that much play other games. If you don't want to play other games then this is what you get, sorry but tough luck. Screaming hyperbolic nonsense on reddit is not going to suddenly make them go faster, if anything it will sour new potential raiders off the game and kill the scene even faster.
---
where the fuck do I try to shut down anything?
---
&gt; This is the community Teapot has curated.
---
He is big on the "own responsibility" thing. It's a rather prominent discussion about twitch and communities, how much influence a streamer has over their own community and if they can curate and direct it into a positive direction with bans etc. You can see this attitude of teapots when it comes to gambling with Black Lion Chests, too. 
---
While agree with you that he doesn't handle the situation well, I disagree with you that he doesn't *try* to handle the situation. The whole discussion is just so emotional with so many preconceived notions from people with all sorts of backgrounds and ideas being brought in from every possible political and philosophical spectrum that we can hardly talk about what is happening, because even the words we use to describe the situation already have different predefined meaning. It's difficult, and I won't even try.
---
Considering that anet doesn't want to do a gear treadmill, and the majority of endgame rewards (i.e. legendaries) are unfeasible for most people due to the massive leap between ascended and legendary, what else is there exactly?
---
The game isn't even all that deep. 
---
PoE, appart from ladder tournaments, also keeps players invested because the game has one of the most complex and deep build making systems in existence, so much so that people literally make multiple characters per league just to try out different builds. 
---
[There are so many builds in PoE that its nearly impossible to even try them all, because every time you think you have, someone will come up with an even crazier one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxPoHv6SGos)
---
Gw2 has no competitive, no gear treadmill, all long term goals are so difficult that most people won't even bother, it doesn't even have a "creation" element like minecraft (Or fuck it even, warframe with orbiter and dojo decoration and construction), it doesn't have a stready stream of content, so wtf does it have?
---
&gt;Well that reasoning is about as fallacious as you can get.
---
I don't think you know what a fallacy is.
---
Lol! The Chinese government censored it, face the reality!
---
I'm mainly talking about the people who came to GW2 with the intent to be competitive, especially former GW1 players. The dropoff among them after the first 1-2 months was absolutely massive. Anet basically had to start rebuilding the community from scratch but it was a losing battle. There were a few good attempts though, no doubt, just nothing came of them.
---
People being assholes about this doesn't mean it was a bad decision.
---
Do you really think that someone wouldn't have abused the tool, and then cried about favoritism or something? ANet officially sanctioning a hack by advertising the stream would not be a good idea for the long term. People should be thankful that they at least turned a blind eye to it during the event.
---
Sense of entitlement in them has grown exponentially because ANet has bent over for them so much in the past.
---
It's kind of like raising a spoiled brat.
---
look how the little clowns get defensiv when they get exposed. ahahahaha.
---
#saltybois
---
Without raids this game would be even more dead, so your argument in itself makes no sense.
---
Seeing how it's *hack* to access *dev tools*, yes they could've easily done that. It's not even first company that would ban big streamer mid-stream over smaller things.
---
For example blizzard banned someone because his fans went to starting area and spammed the shit out of it and lagged servers and streamer iirc kinda encouraged it
---
Right?
---
"Great job showing how good this game that we're all shitting on and bragging about how we're leaving is, guys! We really promoted the hell out of this piece of shit game!"
---
I hope mods will never delete your comments so we can always show new player "friendliest mmo community" in reality.
---
Also, what's your friendly quaggan? Have you shared your guild emblem on ANet page already? I'm so excited to hear about your thoughts regarding Aurene's death, it was SOOOOOO meaningful.
---
"Game dead" has been around since release. It was dead on arrival, it was dead when they did Season 1&amp;2, it was dead with HoT, it was dead with every single update they made, Chronos getting nerfed killed the game as well as Ascended gear. Yet here we are, 7 years later - you can critizise the game all you want, I even get a lot of the criticism and I am not one to see it all positive, especially ANet rushing a new thing instead of improving on the old new thing that was interesting a month ago. For them pushing the gemstore too hard. In the end though, the game is still very much alive, even if players that invested thousands of hours in it begin to lose interest.
---
I've literally never heard of Teapot. Don't kid yourself.
---
If WP were ever to quit that would be a huge blow. And honestly I am not convinced he is staying for the love of the game anymore either.
---
Sad days, but everyone has to do what they have to do.
---
...the official site is not good enough for you now?
---
What about the launcher? Their twitter? Their facebook? It **has** to be an in-game announcement, or it's shit PR?
---
Come the fuck on.
---
Yes?
---
I love you and all the good work you are doing for your employee &lt;3
---
No, pve casuals are people who don't do raids or high fractals.
---
Nah, they'd play direct eliminations instead of "best of 3"s. Like on the previous ERPs.
---
RemindMe! 4 days
---
Best moment right here: [http://prntscr.com/oxodjv](http://prntscr.com/oxodjv)
---
exactly those, yeah :D
---
&gt;  Then that says more about the competency for Anet's staff than anything else
---
It just shows that they can't get their shit together. People bring up TOS and all, but guess who wrote that? It's just exemplary of how they put their own arbitrary rules over what would be cool and fun. As always.

---
what.. the... ? you can use fire skill of your own to do that ? my god i've been using the shitty torch all this time
---
They have 200+ devs working on GW2, about the same amount that works on WoW. It's not an excuse.
---
True but that would make it a bit worse, if LN would have had a hickup on the round 1 they wouldn't have won the tournament potentially
---
This is ONLINE game. This shouldn't need an explanation beyond that.
---
He also used a banned tool to get the camera angles. 
---
There are multiple reasons ANet didn't want to officially support this.
---
Ok Nostradamus, what are we getting then?
---
It's not immediately toxic but if you're going g to run a team and start limiting or requiring some details then you are probably high-strung and critical.  It's a gamble some of us don't take.
---
The recent tournament has proven there's a pretty large interest in hardcore content for Guild Wars 2. I hate to repeat points, but since these points don't really address what I just said:
---
&gt;The reality is they will never release raids at the pace that people want it. If it was going to happen it would be happening already. 
---
Once again, a developer can shift their focus based on the current needs and demands of players. Developers *have* expressed interest. Unless you're apart of the company, you cannot accurately predict the direction of the game. 
---
Even if Arenanet never refocus their game, which is a possibility nevertheless, it does not make the game immune to criticism.
---
&gt;If you care about raiding that much play other games. If you don't want to play other games then this is what you get, sorry but tough luck.
---
Once again, raiding in other MMO's is not what I am looking for, because they aren't experiences which can be compared. Instead of being pointlessly defeatist, I'll just continue to be vocal about my opinion.
---
&gt;Screaming hyperbolic nonsense on reddit is not going to suddenly make them go faster, if anything it will sour new potential raiders off the game and kill the scene even faster.
---
The only option you're presenting here is a lose-lose; to never complain and simply accept things as they always are. That's a garbage, defeatist attitude, and I'd rather not fall in line with that mindset.
---
zug zug
---
I don't mind a Guild wars 2 go , it will be healthy lol
---
really, who have EVER gave a damn about some guild emblems??? com'on now ç\_ç
---
Because this mythical community is a being with its own, uniform will that behaves like one singular person would. :)
---
Important to note the 17,000 viewers on twitch as well, which is some of the highest views of ANY gw2 stream ever, beating out all previous ERPs by a fair amount AND all of the World Tournament Series streams from Anet themselves. I think the only thing that might have gotten more viewers were expansion announcements
---
:dog: SPAM :dog: THIS :dog: DOG :dog: IN :dog: PLACE :dog: OF :dog: A :dog: FROG :dog:
---
&gt; So casuals are the embodiment of evil
---
The gold I would give for people like you to be able to travel back in time to 2 years ago, when every single thread about raids was besieged with "Raiders are toxic", "Raids are impossible to get into", "Raiders are ruining Guildwars 2". 
---
If you spend the better part of 4 years shitting on raids, the raiding community and spread some of the dumbest rumors/lies, you probably shouldn't go all "Picachu meme" when raiders start hitting back.
---
Just new human customization options, like Elonians.
---
But yeah, kinda sad we weren't given the opportunity to "start anew" with a real Elonian character, in Elona.
---
bearbow necros ....
---
Gw2 has little to no competitive elements, no gear treadmill, all long term goals are so difficult that most people won't even bother, it doesn't even have a "creation" element like minecraft (Or fuck it even, warframe with orbiter and dojo decoration and construction), it doesn't have a stready stream of content, so wtf does it have to retain a community?
---
Most of the long term community is still around purely due to sheer grit of hoping things will improve eventually, because of the potential the game has, not because anything it offers at the time.
---
When that announcement they announced a few days ago drops in the 29th, that's gonna be a massive turning point for game for this reason.
---
Either anet will finally give us that improvement we've been holding out for, or they will show how out of touch they are meaning there is no reason to keep holding out.
---
You're in for a surprise when you discover it never was about nostalgia, but good old school gameplay and community bonds vs modern bullshit design.
---
ocx?
---
I always believed GW2 was not worth watching, and this whole ordeal proved me wrong. PvP is a mess, for obvious reasons, but raid speedclearing is amazing to watch, specially when the commentators know the boss mechanics and the builds of the raiders.
---
Now I wish we had tournaments like these for stuff like Queen's Gauntlet too, now that would be goddamn amazing.
---
&gt; but with Anet's attitude towards Twitch in general it's not going to thrive. 
---
More like ArenaNet's attitude towards social media and other modern technologies.
---
the irony :D

---
The way you are trying to interpret it would literally apply to almost any time people as a group try to advocate for something.
---
Also interesting that you cut that out right before this part
---
&gt; Astroturfing is the use of fake grassroots efforts that primarily focus on influencing public opinion and typically are funded by corporations and governmental entities to form opinions.
---
Also the very first sentence on that page:
---
&gt; Astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization (e.g., political, advertising, religious or public relations) to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participants
---
Perhaps next you could wikipedia cherry-picking :)
---
It would still cause enough rerolls. A or B would be easier, and people would still have a preference for what to do first. Either the harder boss to weed out bad pugs more quickly if that fails, or the easier to get partial loot even if the harder fails. 
---
Mob AI in betas had its own share of problems. AoE abilities were useless for damage because AI instantly ran out of it, and it could be used to trap mobs in a basically permanent state of walking when placed all around the mob because it would continue waking to get out of those AoEs.
---
PvE AI has never been good in any MMO or MMO-like game. Especially trash, I've never played any MMO where trash encounters were anywhere close to interesting. Instead, things become interesting when there's unique mechanics and attacks for mobs, like in bossfights.
---
&gt; :D
---
:D

When he gets all steamed up they hear him shout, then tip him over and pour him out.
---
People moaned and complained that the Griffon was just a good sink / purchase and that these mounts should require you to do stuff in game.
---
So, ANet added that.
---
Now, people are complaining again.
---
tldr. You can’t please anyone these days.
---
Sure. Whilst I wouldn't say I'm someone who has been complaining for nearly as long as three years, I'm still happy to be vocal about my opinion, because I don't find it mentally taxing. That, and I find the discourse fun.
---
Necro is very good, and definitely takes the top spot for soloing champions and hero points.  Speciffcaly the reaper elite specialization.  I do agree that the minion mancer playstyle can get boring, but you can switch between that and a general power greatsword build that doesn't use pets if you get bored. It won't be quite as tanky but will kill things faster.  I tend to only run the minion mancer build when I need to do things like HoT hero points solo.
---
The other option that I enjoy is ranger.  Both core ranger and the soulbeast specialization are great for open world.  Personally I enjoyed the ranger leveling to 80 experience more than necromancer.  Necro was great once I got the reaper spec unlocked but getting to 80 and fully unlocking it will take some time.
---
The hidden endgame behind the fashion wars.
---
Cry more, git gud.
---
We are already way past the peak, look at what Teapot the biggest streamer left gets normally, typically around 350-450, Teldo used to get 800-1k, what Teapot gets now is basically what the guy 4th or 5th used to get (Koroshi roaming about WvW).
---
Buy low, sell high.  Follow market trends, get insider info.
---
Mainly same type of sure call items that will pay off over longer periods in time (black lion chest items is a generic go to if I'm bored).
---
I know but it seems we are slowly moving in the direction of some of the features.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
No, it's not. 
---
A mod or add on is something like a DPS meter, UI modification for ease of viewing or helpful hints, or even something like the DirectX 12 wrapper.
---
A hack doesn't inherently mean something bad, but it almost always suggests a direct modification of a piece of software (or, even a physical object's) intended purpose. 
---
Honestly, the aforementioned DX12 mod could even be considered a hack in definition, but there's a key difference still:
---
Something like a free camera not only allows a user to directly alter the game experience and built-in mechanics of the game, **but it also gives a very real advantage, more so than a DPS meter or gear inspection tool ever could.**
---
Imagine PvP or WvW if ArenaNet allowed camera mods. It may be harmless in a PvE environment (and I'm sure Anet recognizes that,) but it would be nearly impossible for them to enforce an exception where a camera mod is allowed in PvE but not in competitive game modes, and such a tool could allow players vision in places they are not intended, giving them a very tangible advantage over other players.
---
So, while the way Teapot used it was definitely harmless, I can completely understand why they don't want to start making exceptions or ignoring the use of *certain* tools.
---
Trust me, a free camera tool like this would be treated as an illegal mod or "hack" in almost any other game with a competitive aspect as well, even ones with more solid add on support.
---
Now, there is something to be said for the lack of spectator options in GW2's PvE environment, so maybe that's an alternative we can look forward to in the future, but I can also understand why ArenaNet didn't just whip up a system for this for a single event like this, as big as it was. Maybe they will see the frustration now, after the event, and consider implementing it soon.
---
For now, though, while any criticism of the lack of such a feature is warranted and appropriate, I can completely understand why they might treat attempts to bypass this with existing tools to be a hack and against the ToS.
---
I'd love to play casual content if it was good casual content. 2-3 hours of story every 3-6 months that is written with questionable elegance just isn't good. I still wonder if it helps or not that I only have to see it once.
---
I see. Well, imo, it's not that egregious as some of the cutscenes were, but to each their own (and I see how folks who are not into the story and roleplay aspects might be annoyed).
---
Sure, WoW just uses gear treadmill and better timegating to better artificially inflate their content. Also large scale PvP and honestly small scale PvP have never been truly fleshed out gamemodes in WoW.
---
Arenanet just aimed a little to high with GW2 I think. Trying to support the wishes of too many disparate groups of players.
---
No saying GW2 is a failure, after all I have gotten more time on it than any other game, but I am just unsure how any other the people that came to the game for sPvP, WvW, or Raiding have lasted as long as they did.
---
Doubt it. I think most will quickly realize what it was like without rose tinted nostalgia glasses on.
---
The birthday blaster is soulbound, not account bound so when you get it on one character, only that character can use it. Putting it in a shared inventory slot will do no good for your other characters.
---
You can also consider dragonhunter (guardian). Lots of traps that cleave through mobs but also provides a challenge because you need to time your blocks, evades etc well.
---
More like it's lack thereof.
---
Switching from vertical to horizontal progression doesn't mean you can skip developing endgame just because.
---
it was stable at 15k for hours
---
At this point, I'd rather see it go down in flames that watch it bleed out and agonize until it's shut down or transformed into an cash-grab abomination.
---
Nice spoiler there
---
&gt;They don’t have any way to give themselves more weight than others in the community.
---
So they try to create the illusion of there being a consensus in the community/playerbase, when there is none.
---
Aka astroturfing. :\^)
---
I mockingly call it "complex", because it is not "complex". The only "complexity" is in finding the most optimal runes/sigils combination on some very specific builds, which makes very minimal difference compared to the next best (and often very obvious) selection - irrelevant when it comes to the general public.
---
&gt; First, if you are here to make some trash post like "cry more" or "git gud", please, fuck off. :)
---
Honestly, you lost me there already... not sure what you are expecting from people to think about a post in general, which has such a start line...
---
Bad things don't exist if you delete the people talking about them!
---
There are so many ways to flip items on the TP that it will depend on your preference.
---
Some examples:
---
* 1) Investments: limited time items that will go up over time
---
* 2) Quick Flips: Items with sell/buy price differnces that allow profit (bulk items like mats, or single larger value items)
---
* 3) Refining: Involves crafting/salvaging/mystic forging/etc
---
Finding a market is going to involve some exploring on your own, with the help of some TP tools out there.
---
Keep in mind, there is always risk involved, more so when starting out, when TP flipping
---
Since when Twitch popularity is a measure of game success? Is it a good customer source? No. 
---
Devs have numbers and all stats they need. They can see what pages leads to their and how often it ends in meaningful way (read info, download game, create account). 
---
Twitch is not a good source of new customers. Bigger impact have so far: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
---
Saying that Twitch is important is like saying that vocal minority of gw2 on reddit have any meaning for gw2 (it does not) or like saying that raids that gathers 1-5% of total game population are important part of gw2 (surprise it's not!). 
---
Deal with it.
---
Fair enough, I can't say much about their experience.
---
So that is how we define the game being "alive" now? LA1 is the liveliest game of them all!
---
Casuals are nothing but a will-less blob, that needs a "hard" core to assume any form and to have anything to aspire to. Surely casuals are easier to milk for money if they are already there, but on their own they will flow down in a puddle and we'll see who is going to play the game in this state.
---
 So yes, ever since the HoT nerfs a-net were killing the game by indulging the playerbase of limp retards,  who were gathered by the initial marketing pitch, promising completely unsustainable things. And chu-chu, our train is arriving on a final stop pretty soon. 
---
Also I'm not your personal psychotherapist, please keep your WoW mental traumas to yourself.
---
&gt;I feel like ANet devs being constantly harassed for what they say and how they say it has driven them into hiding.
---
That's why you hire community managers in the first place.
---
The job of a developer is to develop, not to gather feedback. Of course, it's nice when they do it, but it shouldn't be taken for granted, specially with big projects. Some people is mentally unable to cope with criticism or bad words too, specially in modern days, so more reasons to build a strong CM team, who should play and understand both the game and community.
---
What you mean players don't like our "purity of purpose", duh?
---
Yeah a partner link being on a site is not really support for an event. It's just basic support for a partner, not actually doing anything for the event itself. And I really don't see the problem with ANet ACTUALLY supporting their partners by also promoting other events. Supporting WvW or PvP events would be very welcome as well, but ANet is also not doing that. 
---
ANet didn't just not give support, they also retroactively retracted the slight bit of support they were going to give. It all feels even shittier because of that, and combined with their complete silence on the future of raids has lead the majority of that part of the community (including me) away from the game already, so they'll never have to support an event like this again.
---
yes, of course a high view count on twitch is generally good for developing your brand but I wouldnt use it as the most influental measure of success, if I have better tools available.
---
As you said, if you develop your brand and it becomes recognizable by more people, at some point it will expand your customer base as well. But that turnover is incredibly hard to measure, if at all.
---
While the statistics about how many and during what streams viewers used the sponsorship link to purchase the game are pretty accurate and collected in real time instead of some time in the future.
---
That MikeO is a fake one.
---
As I said elsewhere, it's the structure of GW2's story, not the writing.
---
They do a far better job of consolidating it and making level gates work vs XIV which frequently has level gating of 1, 2, etc.
---
At least with the Job Quests it *kinda* makes sense for every 5, but not every 1 or 2 levels. That's just infuriating. And post-ARR has the ungodly slog issue.
---
No sponsorship meant we were safe from the cringe. It's something.
---
I'm far more relaxed than most people, but there come times when you're tired of being burned by your generosity.  
---
I've seen all sorts of builds pull 2-3k DPS with 25 might, fury, quickness &amp; alacrity.  I wouldn't kick them or flame them, but I would leave.  I'm not interested in making "friends" with people that don't commit towards a mutual respect for other people's time.
---
Don’t EVEN compare GW2 combat to dark souls. Dark souls is slow, clunky and locks you into animations so you have to commit to mistakes, and that’s why it’s so engaging and interesting to watch. GW2 is just spazzing out doing everything at once all the time.
---
I don't see why the announcement page, which is consistently used every month to announce upcoming events, is hurt by the fact that the professions page has not been updated. If you're going to the official site for news and announcements, you are not going to look at the profession page.
---
to see if it would cover the costs for prize pool and labor for organizing the event
---
Nope.
---
Ironically, the only reason why I cared about this one (or got to know it existed in the first place) was because of the "toxic casuals", status quo fanboys, and haters in general.
---
So yeah, good job with the white knighting, lmao.
---
100% true.
---
It's been a thing before the announcement, and it's basically stating where we're at in our end game communities. The big players and streamers want change because it's genuinely been quite a while since any major updates or changes or anything other than a balance patch to our content.
---
WvW doesn't have Alliances
---
Raiders get wings after months or up to a full year, making progress/enjoyment stagnate inbetween
---
PvP hasn't gotten a damn thing other than lanky updates and maps for a gamemode that doesn't have a queue
---
And if anyone mentions any of these it's shot down by the same toxic "wahhh whiner".
---
Having the streamers and big players leave before the big announcement or even after is the biggest impact a game can take. 
---
Especially considering Teapot just destroyed their PR and Marketing
---
Have you considered using the "appear offline" option that the game has? Your friends won't know you're online and you can play in peace.
---
If anet really cared about advertisement and visibility about their game, they could have helped out with some GMs doing the camerawork...
---
They thing is much more that the only Dev who ever really cared about this game and got out of his way to support community events with prices and other stuff left arenanet and now no one feels responsable for the community anymore.
---
All we get now are some meaningless post on twitter and sh1ty low effort events like boss rush where people are already bored out of those after the 3nd in a row and 2 festivals...
---
FYI, the easy mode raids is already implemented. That's why they needed to not only have CMs enabled but also have a "no downstate" rule in the ERP. Dumbing them further down would do nothing for the state of the endgame, except kill it faster.
---
I can totally empathise with players in game modes who feel they have been neglected. PvP in particular still feels as though the population has dropped to critical levels despite skill balances, new skins, and the non-queuable map. I think that many of the concerns expressed here are valid.
---
But it's possible that the announcement will address some of these concerns. It's also possible it will address none of them. I can't help but feel that big decisions about one's personal future with the game would be better left until after the 30th.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/85l5d2/personal_story_flow_chart/
---
I think it probably has to do with certain "lesser race stories" being locked behind specific character races such as in actual comment.
---
Unfortunately i'm not sure if Anet knows what gw2 is
---
Ah FOOOOooo.  Oh well, each character has 1 slot of OW food, guess putting the blaster there won't be any different.
---
For the currencies you can do:
---
* Farm nodes / chests
---
* Do hearts
---
* Do dailies
---
* PvP reward track
---
* WvW reward track
---
* Purchase 5 each per day in Dragonfall in exchange for volitile magic
---
For singleplayer games maybe, in my opinion and experience not for live service titles.
---
Yeah 4 billboards in a few NA cities will surely spark the peoples will to buy GW2. Oh yeah lets not forget the desire those art streams bring. And to top it off a fb post to "link your guild's emblems" will surely bring the extra hype. All together 300 people have seen those adds and 0 decided to buy the game.
---
Dont be a brick, MMO's hype comes from social media and people talking about it and surely not from some '95 advertisement tactics.
---
&gt; If you wonder what twitch can contribute to a games success all you have to do is take a look at Apex Legends.
---
I am aware of that. But for that, you also need the right product/service to showcase it on twitch. And I guess we all agree that GW2 (or most other mmos) isnt that.
---
I am not even sure, if twitch even existed when gw2 was developed but I am pretty sure that EA considered high view counts on twitch as a good source of exposure when developing their marketing strategy for AL and shaped their product accordingly.
---
Limited Match Play type of games are simply easier to watch for the broader audience because you see a conclusion (win or lose) every couple of minutes mostly.
---
MMO´s are mostly about long term goals, so the viewer mostly stays around because he likes the streamer (and then maybe turns to like the game too).
---
Crying "ded geam" doesn't make it more true or less. It dies when the servers shut down.
---
Except HoT came with expectations of new elite specs, raids and legendary armor. LS5 comes with expectations of "oh, more story instances you can afk through and more open world maps nobody would even remember in 6 months time".
---
It is, but the warclas is an official part of the game and Anet have to care about it. The free cam tool is a 3rd party program.
---
Sigh.... *unzips*
---
I put on my robe and wizard hat.
---
Citation needed.
---
Yeah it's no where near dead. However, the hardcore scene (raiding, WvW, PvP) is dying or on the verge of death. Casuals will continue to play and enjoy the game.
---
Yes, it's real-time. Guardians have lots of aegis (block) skills, so when you know a big attack is coming, you can activate that skill and survive. You can also heal other players so lots of utility. 
---
Other advantages, Dragonhunter is a big dps build and welcomed in fractals, raids if you ever want to venture into that. The other Guardian specialisation is Firebrand and it's a great support build but probably not as well utilised for solo play.
---
Necro is fun as well but more chill. Rangers require pet management and you need to venture into certain maps to acquire pets with unique skills, which is a nice incentive to do map exploration.
---
They really are all different. I started with a Ranger, then to Warrior and Necro and now I play Guardian a fair bit. GW2 is very alt friendly. For what it's worth, I'm really enjoying DH (Guardian) and Reaper (Necro) for chill solo PVE play.
---
&gt;(i) software that reads areas of computer memory or storage devices related to the Game
---
I mean, even your OS is breaking this rule ...
---
Never said that *nobody* gets it. Those who do simply don't make a fool of themselve by trying to make fun of it.
---
I guess you lack critical thinking. 
---
Anet will be pleased at how how delusional and brainwashed you are.
---
&gt; I don;t think you are going to get a marketing experts opinion here on reddit
---
but everybody seems to be a marketing expert here on reddit
---
Why did you do this?
---
T H I C C
---
This doesn’t address my point. If you set up content and let’s say you want it to be a week to complete. I’ve played games where the week flys by and you don’t even notice. Guild wars content, more often than not, you feel every minute of the grind. It has nothing to do with the time everything to do with how fun the grind is.
---
End-game doesn't mean Raids, it's all of the end-game players in their respective communities, everyone is done with how their content is handled.
---
I'm having people leave in all content except casual and it's noticeable. Wow classic is hitting and I'm completely expecting to see even more people leave.
---
plenty of pve streamers left
---
&gt; Also interesting that you categorized him as a casual, only because he talks about toxic idiots. You say it's always "the casuals", but please explain how can you be sure that he actually is a casual? Why can't he be a raider as well?
---
Answer this please, that's the importan question. You accused him, so please explain yourself.
---
HAHAHAA that video, oh god. Thanks for the laugh, man! :D
---
In what way did they support it unofficially?  There was Ben in chat and that's it, and he's there all the time (kudos to benp)
---
on a rock actually
---
He's pretty the number one streamer for GW2.
---
It's one of the game's biggest crimes, that's for sure. The most important thing for a MMORPG is the community, and guilds are its backbone.
---
And ArenaNet doesn't give a shit.
---
Not ban Kripp: "Streamer privileges!  Streamer gets away with exploiting!"  
---
Banning Kripp: "He was the biggest streamer for GW2!  How can you ban him?!"
---
the former is retarded.
---
the latter is fair.
---
using the word toxic should incur the deathpenalty.
---
*~~Pikachu~~ Hylek face*
---
I have maybe most respect to LOCH guild of all u guys stepped in when many didnt dare !
---
Now he does this? Hours after the event is over instead of, like, 3 days before the event even started?
---
I mean, you did a awesome event, a kickass tournament and I don't mind telling that I helped the prize pool with 50 of my own gold. Still... 
---
Does migthyteapot have any clue, at all, the amount of spam I saw in game about this? People entering squads| parties from lfg to copy paste anuencements from your tournament? And also spam crap meme comments? 
---
This comment should had been done 3, 4 days ago. He should had tried to stop this way earlier...
---
why, you want that job?
---
How would a pre-event in WvW look like?
---
Absolutely. The game is not dead, but the hardcore scene is dying.
---
&gt; you cant have a normal conversation with someone or even read anything at all. 
---
it's just irc. filter or mute.
---
I think the scary part is how real this statement seems. Raiders have essentially given up and won’t even bother asking for support.
---
Indeed!
---
Well, the twitter account of Wendy's has been a total success, and everyone with half a brain is copying their social media approach.
---
And anyway, who gives a shit about mainstream media.
---
Its literally part of the dev toolkit which is how they got it.   They could've given him extremely limited access on some anet accounts that they wiped off immediately once it was over.
---
Donating money.
---
Raids do not expand on GW2's "potential," that much is extremely obvious. Getting more raids is clearly not going to, either.
---
And all the viewers, too. If the game goes down on flames this Friday, at least we'll have a this last fond memory.
---
As if hardcore players want to continue playing a game that barely offers them content...
---
good post, thanks.
---
Would agree on all your points but I wouldnt single out raiders in the group of veterans, its more or less the same in wvw (my main content besides trading) and probably pvp too from what i hear.
---
That's some quality shitposting right there.
---
The raiding community deserves the hate, I'll be glad to see them leave. The best thing ArenaNet could announce on August 30th is "we're cancelling raids."
---
Like being constructive has helped anyone during the last 7 years.
---
Sometimes we need a good old riot so the guys in charge get their heads out their asses.
---
You must not play many competitive games. The worst you see in GW2 raids is someone getting kicked from a group for wasting their time with wipes. In CS:GO/LoL you have people wishing cancer upon your relatives and threatening to kill you over a failed defuse or missed smite.
---
Except they didn't l.
---
The rant is strong in this one, and it is alright. Being a casual player since launch, I can relate to most of the post.
---
I personally think you are right on many points. Game has changed, community has changed. For better and for worse in both cases.
---
As I write this a few hours have passed so I am not 'on point' with the discussion, but you must have received a lot of flak.
---
People have a hard time understanding that criticizing does not mean hating, keep that in mind. Yeah the post is mostly a personal opinions, but also a critic of the game.
---
On topic, I did not mind the griffon collection and the 250g grind. But the Skyscale got me angry at the endless collection of things. It made me take a break from the game three times since its release. I am now at the saddle part. And will be for a while.
---
Overall a good, well made post on subjects worth thinking about.
---
You always have the option to open your own squad.
---
Sorry, Anet is already planning to drop support for WvW permanently because we didn't bend over for the mount nobody ever wanted. After all, they're a company of petty toxic assholes.
---
First, that is twitch in general.  Chat is always full of crap.  Every game is dead and everything that goes wrong is the developers fault.
---
Second, tacos don't give me diarrhea, but eating a tub of ice cream does because I am lactose intolerant.
---
Third, streamed community events always draw in more viewers because people want to support their fellow players.  The only way streamed official events will get lots of views is if the event has notable players; a prize pool; professional casters; and viewbots.  (Honestly, just having viewbots is the biggest contributor of successful official stream)
---
Kinda misleading that he said "from a different place in the universe". 
---
If the universe is "all", he is right. But if the universe Tyria exist in is just a part of the mists, and (for example) the Underworld, Fissue of Woe and Melandrus Realm are other places in the mists, outside of "Tyria's universe", he is wrong. 
---
But we don't know that and that means saying anything else than "they brought humans from 'elsewhere'" is wrong or at least only speculation.
---
Find urself a guild that will take you in and do raid training otherwise ull b stuck
---
Ranger sounds a better option for me than. That being said. I played WoW for couple of years, and Hunter was my main. So I had too many hours sending my pet ahead while using a bow DPSing from behind. I know Rangers can melee. Is that a viable option for solo end-game content? or really I need to go full 'Pet tank, me pew pew at back' spec to make it work?
---
Yep. Thanks but no thanks.
---
You don't want to get into raiding via the LFG.  It's hit or miss at the best of times; look for the public discord training servers that are referenced via the snowcrows community page.  The LFG is the "first thought," but it's not the "best thought." 
---
you got a mount and a new map. also gliding. what else do you want?
---
You bother posting -&gt; it's relevant, snowflake.
---
Have you tried creating your own lfg?  
---
EU fills pretty fast. There is always new people joining to try and also veterans that just want  to help
---
Yes, but, how would people like to join a squad where the first member they find, has almost no experience?
---
[Yeah here you go fam](https://i.imgur.com/krHROK7.png)
---
you didnt, I just dont know why you would be interested on my opinion about tools that I dont use and therefore dont know what exactly they do and are capable of.
---
Exactly, their game, their rules. They can change them whenever they want to.
---
In my post I even put I looked but couldn't find any which doesnt mean that there isnt any google doesnt always show you everything.so I figured I'd ask people that actually play the game if there was any place that people do giveaways for this sort of thing. I understand that the internet has ruined your point on view of everyone in life and I'm sorry for that but I'm not begging anyone.
---
The easy mode isn't for the benefits of people that play that sort of stuff. It isn't for the benefit of people like myself with completed CMs and weekly clears.
---
An easy mode gets new people into the content, people that the resources are currently wasted on as they do not play the mode. Not only does this make more sense for Anet - more things for more people to do - but it is better for the game mode. It increases the flow of raiders into the more challenging content and makes raid development more worthwhile.
---
We need a surprised hylek meme.
---
But you shouldn't be comparing a collection for a mount with a collection for a Legendary.  Nobody bats an eye when they see a legendary collection requiring 250 of everything.
---
The Skyscale should be compared to the Roller Beetle and the Griffon, the other 2 'optional' mounts in the game.
---
So either ANET missed the mark, or they have shifted their philosophy on what should be required to earn a mount going forward.
---
Reddit karma is just like wvw karma. Hell on this sub you can post the exact same opinion in 5 different threads and have some posts at -50 with others at +50 depending on the state of the circlejerk. 
---
Karma is the most useless of carrots. Completely meaningless and it cant be exchanged for anything worthwhile, yet somehow some people want it. (Pro tip post kittens in pics).
---
The goal for both reddit and wvw is to farm salty tears directly. And those have been 99% off in gw2 for a long time. Kick a bearbow ranger? QQ. Insinuate a build isnt amazing? QQ. Suggest that all of anets poop isnt literal gold? QQ. 
---
Gw2 used to provide fun gameplay, now it provides entertainment reality-show like experiences where you can follow the frantics of batshitcrazy individuals.
---
As others have told, the means to start are not that straightforward, and don't begin with the LFG. Training guilds are the key, or having a group of dedicated friends/recruits to start all together (more rare).
---
Can we have your devs now that all the raiders have left?
---
Actually he open it by saying he understands that it doesnt give boons but he is useful in terms of condi cleanse which is true to an extent. But he never said that in his opinion scrapper isnt useful. 
---
Anyway his whole point is that he thinks scrapper is fun and needs help in choosing a better gear option which i think he already has an opinion of the current status of scrapper, tho you are right that scrapper is not meta at giving boons but let him play what he wants. Kick him if he ever gets in your team but dont dampen his view on a class just because you think that class is useless or that your opinion or meta builds are the only way to ever play a class
---
I'd believe that some developers donated money as part of community but by no means would I call that "Anet unofficially" supporting the event. I think that would be money from their own pockets.
---
I think its important to distinguish Anet as a company and their employees.
---
The general negativity towards Anet lately is targeted to the company as a whole and its PR and decisions. By no means is it targeted at developers, that have no say in these things.
---
Omg if u dont like Anet and the work they do on gw2 you should just leaveEeEEeeeE. Besides ur only vocal on reddit but IRL wvw comminity is like 0,001% of the population so nobody actually raIiiIiiIds I mean plays wvw.
---
Raiders always assume they're a vital portion of the playerbase, when they're a huge resource drain for a game that wasn't even supposed to *have* raids.
---
An announcement. Not kidding.
---
Earlier this week they announced that they are announcing an announcement (Naturally generating hype, you don't announce an announcement for nothing), and for a lot of people it will either make or break the game.
---
Either anet will announce expansion grade stuff, new elite specs, new mechanics, new features, multiple new locations, new races ect. ect. proper competitive/raider support, ect ect revitalizing the game, or they will just announce new map, new map currency, new gemstore cosmetics and "See you again in 4 months, ciao!"
---
People are naturally hyped, because you don't announce an announcement unless you got something big and I think there are multi language streams as well, meaning we're preparing for something truly massive, but a lot of people have lost hope in anet so they are cautious at best.
---
[Here, I typed out the response to the guy above if you're still curious.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cvgf98/17000_people_celebrating_the_game_raids/ey5j3vs/)
---
Nono. The problem isn't that "I want to join a 250+ li" because I know thst I don't have enough experience. But every group thwt i see in lfg asks for a lot of Li. I haven't been able to find one that has no requirement and accepts to follow inexperienced player to start raiding!
---
No game mode is 'elitist', that qualifier belongs solely to the player.  You'll find elitists in unranked sPVP and World Boss trains.
---
One could argue that Raiding requires the most optimal PvE gameplay with regards to build, rotation and group comp, and 'elitists' tend to gravitate towards content that is harder/more prestigious than the norm.
---
TLDR: no
---
the combat has the potential to be best out of the current MMOs. to use it for braindead open world content where you can just use one key is a waste of the game. 
---
you need challenge to show how great it actually is
---
I rock a 1 shot deadeye half the time. I already knock people off mounts constantly...
---
Looking back at it the mount was really a "don't you guys have phones" moment. 
---
As always those that said "wait and see mounts may be a positive and allow Anet to monetize their WvW audience" have gone without consequences while the core WvW players have to deal with off hours dying, roamers leaving and newbs no longer replenishing the ranks due to even higher barriers to entry.
---
WvW is lower pop than ever before, there are no new Warclaw skins, and overall has been another *detrimental* addition to WvW that somehow pleases almost noone.
---
Yeah, that's what I've heard.  My friends seem to continue their statics, but the GW2 channels have been super quiet.
---
&gt; Thus, you're making the assumption that only competition within can create player investment. You still have to prove that.
---
Ok, so let's see the rest of my comment:
---
&gt;Considering that anet doesn't want to do a gear treadmill, and the majority of endgame rewards (i.e. legendaries) are unfeasible for most people due to the massive leap between ascended and legendary, what else is there exactly?
---
&gt;The game isn't even all that deep.
---
&gt;PoE, appart from ladder tournaments, also keeps players invested because the game has one of the most complex and deep build making systems in existence, so much so that people literally make multiple characters per league just to try out different builds.
---
&gt;There are so many builds in PoE that its nearly impossible to even try them all, because every time you think you have, someone will come up with an even crazier one.
---
&gt;Gw2 has little to no competitive elements, no gear treadmill, all long term goals are so difficult that most people won't even bother, it doesn't even have a "creation" element like minecraft (Or fuck it even, warframe with orbiter and dojo decoration and construction), it doesn't have a stready stream of content, so wtf does it have to retain a community?
---
Did your potato brain prevent you from reading all this "Sweetie"?
---
i offer one stack of cauliflower
---
Based on comments I've read from raiders, those "resources" aren't significant in any way.
---
Your best bet is to learn how to pull prices from the API and construct your own spreadsheets.  No way I'm going to sit and scroll through the TP for an hour just looking for the best items - build a "dashboard" for at-a-glance screening and add to it as you find successful items.  Custom spreadsheets also open up material conversion (e.g. bag opening, salvage, crafting, mystic forging, or some combination) as profit making activities.  
---
You also will learn what items are heavily botted so you either don't waste your time or figure out how to trick the bots.
---
I would seriously be down with WvW-exclusive mount skins to earn in-game through playing WvW.
---
To leave the spawn you have to slowly open the gate by running in circles arround some kind of mechanism.
---
your alliance System and 9 months of nothing.
---
So you're telling me I can't exchange my imaginary Internet points?
---
I WANT A REFUND.
---
Anyway, those fanboys will never learn. The game will be dead and the servers offline and they'll still be here, hyping its return or some shit. ArenaNet could literally sell gem store outfits that can't be redeemed in game because the game is no longer running, and they'd still purchase them.
---
Nah, just kidding, they'll just swap to hate mode once they lose their "moral highground" platform, and move somewhere else where they can shill for a new pointless cause.
---
Been saying it for years, fanboys are worse than haters for the health of the game.
---
r/gw2exchange
---
While I know the release cycle for raids was slow, it was still better than what we've had, and was yet one more game mode that ANet took on while diverting resources away from the others. We've complained a lot less in comparison.
---
Thread removed: Do not use this subreddit as a marketplace.
---
lmao you'd get a new keep every 9 months
---
well then make one and play with other inexperienced people?
---
You get dismounted anyway if you get damaged enough. If the dismountER is dismounted as well, that still gives you a shot at escape.
---
I'd put my bet sooner on console rather than mobile.
---
If having a MMORPG with no raids, no mounts, and no open world wasn't risky enough, they threw dungeons away too.
---
This game could have topped WoW had they focused on releasing new dungeons and zones, instead of wasting everyone's time with temporary content and story instances.
---
Dude, that would only mean we would have 1 full dev.
---
If you aim these comments at anyone it should be open world pve.
---
Should have been an accountbound leveling system instead, like PvP and WvW ranks.
---
I know it was just an example, but as i said there are a lot of resources to get into raids, but you gotta put some effort yourself as well. Discords, guides, training guilds etc. Good luck.
---
Only it doesn't. You can't get into this content if you're not explicitly seeking challenge. That's the whole point of it. It's the defining feature, the reason to exist. And people who do seek it are already finding their way into it.
---
Yeah, in fact the bow deals fairly poor sustained damage so it is much better to stay in melee combat as much as you can.  The bow is great for sticky situations where you need to back off for a sec, engaging an enemy/s, or meta events.  You can actually run greatsword and sword/axe as your weapons with no bow at all and be just fine.  In fact that loadout does more damage and if you ever end up doing group content like fractals you would use those weapons and the soulbeast spec. I find the utility of the bow and it's range invaluable for some things in open world though.
---
I just got both expansions off Nuuvem. They're a Brazilian store I think and I'm in the US, but they took PayPal.
---
I have to argue, a lot of WvW players *do* like the mount. It wasn't asked for, which brought on most of the salt, but that was separate from some of the convenience that many have subsequently admitted to liking. Roamers still get to pick off tails, havoc groups get to flit around a bit faster, and navigating the map is less of a snooze.
---
Sometimes I wish WvW players would show the same level of solidarity and support for our WvW guilds and commanders. 
---
We have much to learn from our PvE counterparts when it comes to celebrating their top raiding guilds and leaders.
---
yes, they are.  
---
just as for others, the be-all end-all game mode is PVP, or WVW, or PVE Meta events. Nothing wrong with that IMO.
---
Gameplay is fine, content is the problem, always has been.
---
&gt; That is quite untrue and I'd highly recommend looking into the history of the raiding scene in WoW and why initiatives such as variable difficulty and LFR were introduced.
---
I would argue Mythic raiding fits that bill. Very few players ever Mythic raid, but mythic raids are huge for Blizzard from a PR perspective.
---
I still think LFR was a mistake.
---
The worst I've witnessed are AB pugs when one side oneshots
---
&gt; ...buff classes like necro but they won't either. In fact necro was nerfed last balance patch to dismay of literally everyone...
---
Literally invalidated everything you were trying to say by exposing yourself.
---
I always post LFG's with stuff like "T4 No hamster owners, BYOB" or "T4 Plat3 + pvp rank req" just something really stupid. I find that it weeds out all the toxic people, and the people who do join are usually pretty decent too. At least as good as I am and often times better.
---
we know you didn't mean that. Its OK to apologize on the internet, you know?
---
I'd be disappointed.
---
As if everyone is the same.
---
Can someone give me an insight what is this all about?
---
This really isn't that high. You could see it standing at Lyssa without too much effort.
---
&gt; ...hardcore world bosses...
---
Holy shit the self-exposures in this sub-thread.
---
Every other BL chest update, more or less.
---
Other mmos: farm hard for months to get one piece of gear to be even able to do other content only to have that gear rendered useless soon. "It's okay, that's progression and sense of achievement".
---
Gw2 community: can easily catch up and do any content and once it has farmed for the thing, it Stays relevant and "omg gw2 so unfair I can't fly with the other people without spending time on game omfg Im gonna quit".
---
I don't play those two specific games for that very reason. I do play Overwatch, which can get pretty toxic, but with the recent role queue nobody's stepping on each other's toes right out of the gate and games have ended up a lot less generally toxic overall.
---
ANet needs to remember their design philosophies and remove unnecessary barriers to entry and points of conflict that create situations where players behave poorly toward others. Players behave within the confines of the game's systems, so CS:GO/LoL create undue stress that puts players in situations where they feel their time has been wasted by others, and they then lash out - raids are similar in that you might waste several hours trying to clear a boss because some people aren't pulling their weight. Tell me the last time that happened to you and the group actually cleared the content after kicking the person they put the blame on - it doesn't actually happen often. That person is a scapegoat for the real problem of a lack of team synergy.
---
I know a lot of people wouldn't like it, but an LFG similar to FFXIV, where players can simply join without having to worry about an instant gear check would do a lot to stave toxicity in raiding and fractals. Getting your own static is obviously the best way to avoid toxicity - I know I certainly miss my statics for both (people stopped playing or took breaks, groups fell apart or took a hiatus and then never continued on) - I'm specifically talking about PUGs.
---
As for my 'raiders aren't toxic' comment, that was more pointing out how fucking nuts they went attacking ANet for not supporting the use of a hack tool and then trying to claim that they aren't toxic. They are, and yesterday's behavior only helped to reinforce that stereotype. If they don't like being called toxic, maybe stop being toxic.
---
Yes, both were a necessity - the difficult raids because that is *always* what WoW has offered - be it SWP, Heroic LK or Mythic Archimonde. The biggest success in expanding the playerbase for raiding was easier difficulties, and the scaling buff, in WotLK.
---
Personally I am not a fan of the style of LFR, but it has distinct and useful purpose. Make better used of the content that has already been created. The other three difficulties? That is what I'd like to see mimicked more in GW2 instead of one and done CMs.
---
I'm expecting it to be something like a new mastery tier or two over the course of the season (ideally something not mount-related), new maps and associated content (as per usual), maybe a fractal, and possibly a new mount. 
---
Best case scenario: the season will build up to the next expansion over the next year or so, which will most likely involve unlocking maps along the way to Cantha. We'll either do shit to fix the dragon balance before Taimi dies, or there will be a new crisis to deal with (I don't think the gods are gone for good, for instance).
---
A lot of people don't want Blizzard to throw massive support behind the world first race. They acknowledge its happening and always make sure to at least acknowledge the people who complete it.
---
People don't want Blizzard to throw support behind the event, because it's largely treated as a community thing and Blizzard putting their weight into it basically gives them full control over it as an event.
---
People are mad at Anet because:
---
1. They never throw their support into anything and actively disengage the community most of the time
---
2. The reason they didnt support it while reasonable on a "dont support a third party tool stance" is easily ignore by the fact that the third party tool fixes core problems with their game. People wouldnt be mad if the game was half way watchable to begin with or had actual competent thought put into its visibility or tools.
---
Exposing myself by saying that necro was nerfed last patch when he was in fact nerfed last patch when he is one of the most universally agreed upon worst classes for endgame pve content?
---
breaking the shatterer's break bar 20 times will certainly slow things down.
---
they gave new season because they were working on expac but had to cancel it in january, so they scraped all together and started working on season 5 because they knew trying to keep players till expac was ready with such a giant delay would 100% kill the game, now they can try and milk it out a bit more. hence why they announced the season 5 so early so people wouldn't get hopes up for expac or anything.
---
Harder modes, sure. Easier? Waste of dev time. The game already has fractals as a sort of difficulty progression.
---
what do you mean? did you even read the thread? Dev herself told in other thread you CANT use LFG for anything releted to home instance as they dont consider home instance a grupe content.
---
They want low effort: high rewards.  It's "low effort" for them to throw around money vs. the time required to actually build up the community, features, personalities and skill/tool-sets to support all these various modes.  For example, the WTS &amp; ESL series happened *before* the PvP re-work, *before* the PvP Lobby re-work, *before* the reward tracks ??? The WvW Tournament? again it happened *before* Reward Tracks, HoT/PoF Elite Specs -- they push things *hard* before they have the infrastructure. 
---
Then they feel "burned" because it doesn't pan out, and why would it pan out? They innovate and iterate on some sort of event or feature and then they let the mode slide for like 8-9 months, [and act all confused why things have crumbled.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/flame-war.gif)  These sorts of features are great, but ArenaNet needs to ***follow through*** instead of recklessly and irresponsibly moving from one project to another.
---
Whilst I don't think the majority of people had this experience, I personally got my initial start in raids by posting a thread on the official forums and asking if any raid guilds would be willing to pick up someone enthusiastic about getting into raids. It only took about a day to get a couple of offers, one of which I took up on. 
---
As others have said, training guilds are also great. As an experienced raider I've hopped into a few training runs on LFG to help out once in awhile, so try that if you think you can create your own squad, but I can understand why it could be a bit intimidating to create your own squad. 
---
Best of luck!
---
&gt;community rumbling that the game feels directionless and isn't being what it has the potential to be
---
Somehow I think that I've seen this before, i.e. in the Great Content Drought of 2013/14. We'll see what Friday's "big" announcement brings and whether ANet can make people excited once more, but they have an awful lot of challenges. Right now, I have the impression that virtually all aspects of the game, apart maybe from Living Story, are in a pretty sorry state.
---
&gt; Is Anet trying to be GGG or ED by rolling constant stream of content?
---
No, they tried that in LS1. It wasn't sustainable. Which is why they moved to the current cadence of LS episodes. I don't think LS1 was half-baked or lackluster though - in fact, it's one of the only occasions in which I've seen an AAA title employ impactful, story-driven world changes. I also liked that the entire playerbase mobbed the content, due to it being limited in duration. There were clues leading up to each week (every 2 weeks!) and the speculation and hype was actually fun. 
---
I don't think Anet is abandoning the expansion model, but you also can't forget the fact that the first several years of the game denied the possibility of an expansions. They're just delaying expansions while they restructure, balance staff, and reassess the game's direction and design philosophy. We'll likely get one after LS5 builds up to it, as the current season obviously didn't leave us in a position for an expac announcement (story-wise).
---
Computer says no.
---
Why did you remove the image, did you make it in paint? How can one person be so fucking toxic, you're everything wrong with this community.
---
&gt;valid
---
yes.
---
&gt;it tells you how many times the person did the content
---
also yes.
---
&gt;It does not work perfectly
---
&gt;there are chatcodes
---
relevant. see above.
---
&gt;people can still suck with KP
---
re-fixed.
---
&gt;its still better than putting 'exp' on LFG and hoping for best
---
Maybe actually explain your reasoning instead of using 'no' or 'irrelevant'. Otherwise its just a wall of salty text.
---
Yea I agree... I really hope they add a hard mode for the current raids... Its stupid how easy they are (not /s since a full clear on a random week day is normal, way to easy for decent/ok players)
---
I have a feeling they're not adding it to novelties because it has gameplay implications (it's basically an infinite shareable food buff).
---
So on one hand, it's silly not to add it because it just takes inventory space and is never consumed.
---
On the other hand, drawing a clear divide of "novelties cannot affect combat performance" is healthy, even if this item is not monetized.
---
&gt; ##What's a book club?
---
There's actually a way faster method to do this.
---
Go to the area with the beds, grab the 3 pieces of the med kit,and use them on the move, using the skills followed by esc to cancel all the superfluous extra channeling time, and go to the back of the area and throw the the med kit to two doctors at the same time. Near them there's another 3 pieces of a kit you can quickly build up on the move while grabbing them, and throw it again to two doctors at the same time.
---
Aiming at them is is easier if you set ground targeting to Normal or Fast with indicator.
---
After that, your ball will be mostly full, and you can just inspire 1-2 people to get the heart done. This can be done in less than 15 seconds. 
---
With 33 characters, I could have it done in just 2 days, but that'll be rather boring, so I did map completion and the metas 4 times instead.
---
&gt; Kripp exposed and promoted an exploit back then.
---
You can only say this with a straight face if you also think posting frogs means you promote the holocaust.
---
&gt; Personally I am not a fan of the style of LFR, but it has distinct and useful purpose. Make better used of the content that has already been created.
---
I think it has a hidden cost though. There is something cool about doing something a bit challenging and getting to see content as a result. 
---
Saying "I beat Deathwing!" feels very different than "Well I already beat Deathwing, but this time it was on heroic mode!.
---
I'm so fucking happy people aren't even trying to explain anymore. AAAAHHHH
---
but WoW isn't F2P, which I think is major boon for GW2, if not economically
---
Totally. I appreciate that Anet is willing to experiment with different content delivery systems, but I'm surprised at how many people disregard the content we recieve via LS, and how it serves to pace the rate at which people consume new content.
---
As a dev in business software with a focus in ERP and CRM, I agree.
---
Scrapper may be fun. It's definitely "viable" (as in you can complete the content).
---
I also can guarantee he will have a hell of a time finding a CM group willing to accept one, and many t4s group won't either.
---
Also theres 0 chance to get him in my team since i'm the healer :p
---
I don't think the class is useless, but i know the reality of pugging fractals (i pug 2 dps every day).
---
It's funny because I haven't been playing much GW2 the last 2 months.... because I've been playing the hell out of WF. I also watch all the (non-platform specific) WF streams, because there's always cool new stuff. I don't remember the last official GW2 stream I watched (although I will watch on Friday obviously).
---
Guild Bounties and Shining Blades Bounties should have been the starting point.
---
Now you can do hearts at your local farm by \*actually\* feeding cows!
---
Why they want my phonenumber? Do they SMS me the watch if I win?
---
\&gt; Thank you for entering the MTM &amp; GuildWars Watch Giveaway. A Grand Prize winner will be announced on the MTM Special Ops [Facebook Fan Page](https://www.facebook.com/MTMSpecialopswatches) on September 15th, 2016 and will be notified by email.   
---
\*\*2016\*\*   
---
Wat
---
This is because those countries have such laws that prevent stuff happening there. No reason to blame Anet.
---
Is it (canada excluding quebec) and (eu) or canada excluding (quebec and eu) ?
---
Well, after Diablo going:
---
&gt; Community: We want to see ANYTHING NEW for Diablo as long as it's for PC.  
---
&gt; Blizzard: Do you guys not have pho~~~~ones?  
---
It's understandable when people go into panic over nothing. There's precedent.
---
Its not impossible as you say, but meeting me with that while I'm not playing with them (since we do the same kind of content) and at the same hours will sure arise suspicious and problems. :/
---
If NA can't win a raid tourney I guess they can win a watch now!
---
&gt; It's not impossible!
---
Since they specifically said they laid off the people who were working on mobile projects and moved them back onto core GW2, it's so improbably as to be effectively impossible.
---
Not entirely true, I just checked and you actually can play WoW for free but only until level 20. GW2 is more forgiving in that regard but still, from what I have seen players are not really that turned away from paying money if they have a well-known and successful studio behind the game.
---
Blizzard also has a huge fan base through all of those IPs they produced over the year which most likely heavily contributed to the success to WoW.
---
I mean, if you look at it, Gw2 gives you so much content and even for free if you play regularly and players still complain about the addition to gem store items as if they never had to work for their money in any way.
---
once again a very fishy giveaway that wants our data and isnt even open to the entire playerbase noooooope
---
I salute the effort, I guess, but it did little to quell my laughter because it's all just so genuinely disappointing and sad.
---
&gt;  it was extremely time consuming and not that casual-friendly
---
This is the main reason I haven't been able to get into raiding. Most of the raid groups I see happen either at 2am or while I'm at work. I wish they would release the raids with an option for story level difficulty (albeit with reduced rewards) just for us who want to experience the story, but don't want to take on another full time job when some of us are already working 50+ hours a week.
---
if you scroll all the way to the bottom on sweepstake you can see this line.
---
"2019 Multi Time Machine Inc. All rights reserved."
---
coincidence?
---
i mean when the next expansion/big content drops he will be back, every mmo content creator says the same thing about any game they play, i mean how many WoW streams actualy quit wow and didnt come back every expansion release
---
Piss off
---
Like...many other giveaways in many other games?
---
Not wanting to sound like a whiteknight but it's almost as if every reason to smear some more shit on ArenaNet was a signal to spill more salt...
---
They should add a difficulty selection on raids for the noobs so the hardcore keep their challenge and the noobs feel like they have more game to play.
---
There definitely should be a system in place to make it more known that defense is thrown out the window at higher levels of play. I feel like that's the #1 problem with the game is it allows you to do whatever you want, but then end game comes around and people who were accustomed to tanking hits instead of dodging them don't know how to play the game.
---
People have different mindset of doing content. It's just that maybe u like to play slow and safe and someone else likes to play the fast risky way.
---
Either way both parties are certainly not bad at the game.
---
Just different mindsets
---
I'm a raider and I find the entitlement of many other raiders strangely misplaced. The game was never designed to cater for a raiding playerbase and yet we still get consistent releases, at the pace of 7 to 9 months since Summer 2016.
---
The entire notion that the raiding community isn't catered to is silly. We could absolutely do with some variable difficulties - an easy mode and repeatable CMs. Maybe some more mini bosses and champs in raids to vary things up, but compared with WvW... Yeah. Not quite the same.
---
thank you! that explanation really helped. guess I didnt understand that I dont need to check the dxvk option when I installed it as chainload.
---
One more question. I would like to use your script. However, it seems it doesnt load on start.
---
What I did?
---
* placed it in the Guild Wars 2/bin64 folder
---
* python 3 with pip and requests module is installed (I use manjaro)
---
* in lutris it is configured in the system options as Pre-launch command and the checkbox for "Wait for pre-launch command completion" is activated
---
* checked the "Show logs" of lutris when I start GW2 but in there it only show that it started the gw2-64.exe
---
Watch the full credits, they put "Into The West" by LOTR as the ending theme oof...  
---
I'm gonna copy-pasta a YouTube comment to show you why that was the perfect song choice:
---
&gt;PIPPIN: I didn't think it would end this way.
---
&gt;GANDALF: End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it.
---
&gt;PIPPIN: What? Gandalf? See what?
---
&gt;GANDALF: White shores, and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise.
---
&gt;PIPPIN: Well, that isn't so bad.
---
&gt;GANDALF: No. No, it isn't.”
---
&gt;― J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings
---
No they weren't. The only new rewards were a miniature and a backpack skin (for achievements) and reskinned weapons (from heavy RNG loot). It could be farmed perfectly, it was just a waste of time.
---
And yeah, I really miss the hard AI the game had during the beta.
---
&gt;  It’s like nothing good about the game even exists anymore
---
Why the fuck are we obliged to talk about positive stuff when we need to get the criticism out? This isn't a fucking game where the goal is to balance both viewpoints equally. Sometimes, it's just shit and that is all that matters for now until it is fixed.
---
Make your own god damn threads in which you point out the positives. I did so. It's currently  [90% upvoted](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cvgf98/17000_people_celebrating_the_game_raids/). But god damn the discussion culture you propose in which you have to weaken your own fucking point by remarking on from the criticism completely disconnected, positive points is absolute aids.
---
Same problem here, any solutions yet ?
---
Oh you don't know anything about marketing... Like at all. Trust, thus would've been a good opportunity for ANET to promote the game and engage the community
---
You literally gimp your team by running sub-optimal builds. If you have a group of friends that doesn't mind? That's fine, but playing with strangers who took the time to grind for meta gear aren't going to put up with shitters slowing down their runs when they can just find someone who is respectful of the meta. 
---
I've been on both ends of this stick, personally. So I understand the frustration on both sides.
---
That is many times true.  When I create LFGs, I do things like that or ask specifically for non-speed runs, non-toxic, all welcomes type posts and most times they fill out immediately or way, way faster than other LFGs.  Sad thing is when you get speeder, toxic person joining anyway because they didn't read the LFG.  Then there are issues.
---
No, Harry (Target) from SC said he is not going to stop updating them.
---
It’s open to EU, read the rules.
---
If the watch reads in Anet time, will it be able to decipher "Soon^TM ?"
---
Oh, so because the others are full of garbage, we can't complain about our own garbage? What kind of shitty logic is that?
---
Enter random digits
---
yes please.
---
Wait, there was no gold for Aetherpath in the beginning? Then my memory on this got kinda rusty...
---
&gt; Anet is terrible developer, they have unoptimized tools that make for such long content releases (best example - full armor set takes 9 months to make, this is pathetic).
---
Seriously. Why are you here? If you honestly believe that - why are you here? Just go. You are only being miserable and dragging people down with you. If you truly think ArenaNet is a terrible developer, find a game made by a good developer and be happy over there.
---
They are still hiring people specifically with console experience though. Not that I think this will have anything to do with the announcement on the 30th.
---
Truth hurts, so the only answer you have is 'leave'. Thats not the approah I would assume from friendliest mmo community.
---
&gt; Hard core players are definitely less happy than casuals right now, and they have every right to say so.
---
I'm both a hardcore player and a casual. I've done hundreds of fractal dailies over the last seven years, I've crafted several legendaries, I used to run dungeons dailies before the HoT nerfs and I've made the only set of legendary armor I care to make. I've been in raid statics and raid pug groups. I've also run Living World map trains, Teq raids (back when TTS did them pre-HoT), I've done festival dailies or had months where the most I did was occasionally log in to say to friends. I have over 30k APs and I had my 7th birthday with the other head start players. I've had years where I spent no money in the gem store and I've had years where I bought multiple things.

I personally find the idea that hard core players are any more or less entitled to feel happy than "casuals". I personally think it's ridiculous to label players as such - many of us wear multiple hats, different hats at different times. Many of us are also happy or unhappy with the content we play. I know WvW players who are still happy and enjoying WvW, I know raiders who are enjoying their two month old raid, I know Open World players who find the champion farm event tedious and boring and they also haven't found the maps and story content from S4 particularly satisfying (I am one of these people).
---
The idea that hard core or veteran players have some kind of monopoly or entitlement to disatisfaction with content, or that specific game modes are somehow perfect and immune to criticism or improvement is just ridiculous. It's also pointless - you don't do anything positive for the game modes you like by playing victim olympics over who has it worst.
---
because doesn't want us dedicated players, only ultra casual players who login every 3 hours a week max and want all endgame rewards without putting in effort
---
It literally literally is. Literally.
---
Funny how this sub gave 0 shits about twitch views (It’s more fun to play than to watch!!) until the ERP event.
---
And here I thought this would be a wholesome picture to try to unite the reddit community...

kys
---
there are daily training runs in the LFG.

if there are none, FEEL FREE TO START YOUR OWN AND FIGURE SHIT OUT JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DID

I did.

The text doesn't change by selecting any country in the EU in the dropdow list. I hard-refreshed the page just in case and it keeps saying the same. Using a proxy site to view the page doesn't change the text either.

Do we live in parallel universes that are somehow connected through Reddit or something?
---
&gt; In actual game play things happen that you have to react to.
---
What you imply here is incorrect. Yes shit happens in fights and you need to adapt your rotation to the fight but unlike what you imply you are still able to follow that rotation almost to the letter in every situation. Those things you need to react to on the fly are largely predictable and can be worked into a rotation.
---
They buffed them a few years later, and actually made the drop rate for the reskinned weapons far better too.
---
This was 6 years ago, so no biggie if you don't remember it well. I just tend to have a rally good memory for this kind of bullshit (but I forget my own birthday lmao).
---
Ehh... Cool story. 
---
Nobody plays that and quickbrand doesnt generate might.
---
is there a version of this comic where you didn't crop it like an idiot? (likely to hide where you stole it from?)
---
I don't care really, I'm not participating either way. I don't think these kind of promotions help the game either, but whatever.
---
yeah just look how low effort and uninspired their champion rushes are 3 times a row even the casuals are bored to hell with it (maybe 1-2 squad in lfg)
---
Understandable. With the event going on and, let's be honest here there is nothing going on in GW2 this weekend, we felt it was appropriate to let everything go to let people be excited. 
---
As we head into this week we have a patch tomorrow with 500 cooking and the announcement on friday so we'll be resuming the normal policies and if necessary we will make megathreads regarding post ERP discussion if required.
---
Hundreds of thousands of people passionate about video games use twitch daily. Guild wars 2 managed to get very high with its view count so it positioned really high in the list of games. You do realize this is one of the best marketing platforms for games and to promote this event arenanet would have just probably had to use one working hour by one person. If they organized it themselves they would obviously use more hours, but similar coverage like they had last weekend in such a huge platform would definitely pay back.
---
Teapot (along with multiple guilds and veterans) is leaving (or already left) because there's nothing for him to do at the game anymore and the direction Anet is taking isn't very promising as far as end game is concerned. Raids get old when u do them everyday, wvw has the most stale and boring meta ever, pvp is an afterthought...
---
A masochistic karma whore by the looks of the downvoting 😂
---
Honestly, I'm wary of entering my details as at this point I no longer trust anets partners in stuff like this. 
---
A shame, bc that watch is really neat :|
---
You can leave it "blank", it accepts 000000000.
---
I wouldn't be surprised. I've had a hunch about that for a while now... And it could be actually good for the game, if they get the controls right. The Chinese version came out of nowhere too, for those who don't remember.
---
Still, its probably just LW5, plus player housing, and maybe new elite specializations. I wouldn't bet for more than that, and I'm already being generous.
---
Anet does a lot of shit I personally don't like with my main gripe being PvP/WvW and raids mostly going ignored.
---
We get world boss events, champ events but the other modes - Nada.
---
Anet not supporting this however? I don't see that as an issue at all. The offer was there, It was declined. I'm no expert but wouldn't their be legal issues if Arenanet provided prize money for a tournament which uses third party software?
---
cant wait til i see gameplay
---
Can you check for a file called: gw2_addon_update.log inside the gw2/bin64 folder? Also if you want to keep your current version of d9vk make sure to set check_d9vk inside the script to False or it will download the current version from the github site. I hope this helps.
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=if+we+unite+nobody+falls
---
How do you know that if you haven’t played the game?
---
If they move GW2 to mobile, expect mobile-tier cash grabbing.
---
Anet support dev told me Sept. 3rd
---
What's even weird (and disappointing) is the Country list on form has South America entries but the terms say they aren't eligible... yay for misleading &gt;.&gt;
---
Also yes, at first glance I thought EU were excluded.
---
They released mount lootboxes in the middle of an Internet-wide controversy about lootboxes. Talk about timing.
---
I'd like to submit this comment as exhibit A for why HoT killed small guilds.
---
Your actions to defend the furnace are illogical.
---
The furnace will be taken.
---
101/10!!! Absolutly fantastic, my new wallpaper &amp; I will be making one on wallpaper engine our of this if that's ok :D
---
didnt you see Roys tight ass....pretty erotic.
---
&gt; instead of acting like a bunch of entitled brats.
---
You mean people who paid for the game, but couldnt play HoT in its early days/raids/t4 fractals because they were hard to play? Or the people who still complain how skyscale is too hard to get? Or maybe you meant the players who want to kill a world boss to get legendary armor and mount skins because this is a casual game and they don't want to "work" to get rewards? 
---
I'm not quite sure who's your target, you'll have to be more specific.
---
Never seen that. And yet Reddit is mostly toxicity. Reddit is not a good example of the average player.
---
I believe casuals also supported ERP :), i know i did .
---
The fact that teapot is a partner and the biggest GW2 streamer means that anet should at the bare minimum tweet and advertise the event. They didnt even do that and that's very low effort. No1 asked them to fund the prizepool or provide casting or go out of their way to organize the event. Even a small message on social media would be okay.
---
Instead they completely ignored it to tweet about fluff and quaggans as per usual.
---
As others have said snowcrows raid training is your best bet, if that isnt up your alley try joining a guild who has a few days of raid training (mine has 3 days worth) the reason for such high requirements is simple, with 200+ kills you know the boss, you know the mechanics and you know your class, it matters because a lot of bosses are giant HP sponges with mechanics that if failed can cause a complete wipe of the party just from your mistake alone, like cannons on sab, bombs on sab, oil on Demios, greens on VG, claim, dispel or protect on MO etc. The list goes on and on, all it takes is one person to not do a mechanic or fail it and its GG try again as *everyone* will down. Theres another option that's faster, watch a video explaining the mechanics, composition and post in LFG as a training group, much less advised but it will put you in raids quicker.
---
your idea of "solving the drama" is to just silence all discussion pertaining to topics that are negative or bad.  You just want a community filled with sunshine, rainbows YAY, happy, art posts and fluff.  It's pathetic.
---
Change happens when enough attention is brought to an issue.  People want more raid content, they want WvW updates, they want PvP balance and remaining silent accomplishes nothing to get change.  The fact that Anet didn't support the even is just another instance of them clearly not caring whatsoever about the community.  They don't communicate, they don't listen, they don't do anything but sit in their bubble and release gemstore items and a new LS map every 4 months.  The ERP was just the latest in a long line of disappointment from Anet.
---
We want them to do better pertaining to both the game and the community.  We want them to interact better like most other game developers do in 2k19.  We want them to change and criticizing them and calling them out is the first step.
---
Why are they on the reddit if they don't like it then? Considering that it's very simple to leave the game if you dont like one, how come they use reddit if they dont like people on it?
---
ur gay lol
---
Drama is exciting. The JP drama was one of the best bits of content I have had in this game. 
---
Sadly, Raids are the only good content in the game for PvE. I'd gladly play anything else in PvE if it had even a fraction of the engagement as raids do. But Pressing 1 on Woldbosses and bounties doesnt do it for me like it does most in this game.
---
&gt;satisfy this demographic
---
you know that 90% of the top raiding guilds consist of people that played since way before raids right?
---
Been told a thousand times by Teapot before as well, but the HIVE MIND knows no boundaries.
---
Anet at least did a lot them self to attract such players tho who want all endgame rewards without ever putting in effort and prefers to just brain afk auto a boss.
---
Their mistake is to only listen and care about them, not thinking about that putting out only single player content since PoF (where the map die out in 1-3 week) and ignoring dedicated players who plays more then 2 hours a week needs content to do. You may make good money from casuals put a MMO without meaningful endgame content and a community behind it will never work longterm.
---
Also anet management and advertising is so laughably bad, im not sure if they just dont care about their game or want do kill this game on purpose in favor of their future mobile game (much easier to milk players).
---
It says excluding Quebec.
---
Watches are still around? I didn't think people still used those since most people have a powerful computer in their pocket and the apple watch was a flop.
---
He may be a hardcore memer and loves his lols but unlike some other content creator he always remained positive, hopeful and joyful, he realy is a great asset to the community.
---
&gt; The gold I would give for people like you to be able to travel back in time to 2 years ago, when every single thread about raids was besieged with "Raiders are toxic", "Raids are impossible to get into", "Raiders are ruining Guildwars 2". 
---
So by your definiton everybody who don't raid is a casual? That's what you say here.
---
I wouldn’t ask any my friends who quit the game to come back in its current state.
---
&gt; Anet not producing enough raid content for you? There are many other areas of the game to play.
---
Replace Raid with PvP, and try telling that a PvP player. You're telling us we should stop asking for content and play content we don't like because it lacks any kind of challenge and thus gets repetitive even easier.
---
Regarding the JP drama: Teapot was massively defusing the situation on his stream, telling people to not fight fire with fire and to not blame ArenaNet for anything that's happening here. You want him to pretend nothing happened, put his fingers in his ears yelling "lalalala", especially after two of his friends got attacked?
---
Guild Wars refers to the lore events in the battles between the Kingdoms of Kryta, Orr and Ascalon nothing relating to the mechanisms of the game.
---
Elemantalist is your best option to hit all that criteria by far
---
&gt;Why are they on the reddit if they don't like it then?
---
Trolls and circlejerk mostly.
---
Did you just assume their sexual orientation?
---
I have set it on False so it should only check for arcdps. There is no gw2\_addon\_update.log inside the gw2/bin64 folder. The path inside the script is correct (without the wine prefix)
---
You can put 0000000 as phone number, it accepts that.
---
...Making an account can be done in under 30 seconds. What are you even talking about?
---
People mimimi because the game is more focused on PvE/open world/LS than on raids. 
---
I mean it's like this since release, but some people just don't want to see that.
---
because it's the game's biggest community event? 17k viewers for gw2 is insane. big missed opportunity by them for a petty reason
---
&gt;ANet signed up for this drama the moment they introduced raids into the game, because it was evident that GW2 would never be able to satisfy this demographic. The back-then casuals were telling that this exact thing would happen, and so here we are.
---
This can be said for many things and not just raids. PvP, WvW, dungeons, fractals, guild content, the list go on. It still baffles me that overworld heroes think raids is the only thing anet has been ignoring for years now.
---
Hahah, that's pretty naive (in a good way). xD
---
do you know why some people immediately jump to "ok then leave the game"?  it's because they don't feel like the game has to last forever.  the counterargument is always "oh well development will slow down for the casual shit you like too", as if people don't already know that.  it's NORMAL for games to wind down, especially if they've already become so bloated with contradictory systems layered on top of each other and 80000 types of currency.
---
can games be made to shamble along literally forever by patching themselves up enough that they ensnare the hardcore as long as possible?  yes.  is some version of that anet's goal, at least for now?  yes.  do i give a shit about how long this game's existence stays driven by the hardcore?  not even a little bit.
---
I am more interested in the possibility of a guild wars 3, with new engine tech, more action-based combat, and a rethinking and simplifying of the various vestigial systems and currencies that plague gw2.
---
They always were.
---
To the best of my knowledge there has never once been a training group during my play time, so I was forced to use LFG and lie.
---
TL;DW: Anet did want to support, but only if he didn't use the camera hack. Teapot refused and so Anet didn't do anything. Just as has been noted by plenty of people before
---
&gt;I mean, the quality of maps and story is going downhill too. 
---
I firmly disagree
---
As already proved, devs have everything planned and in production about year ahead of time. Hiring someone now means nothing like this is coming within a year.
---
This I think is the best reply to my comment, so i will just reply to yours! Thanks for that! 
---
Yeah, there just seem to be the more experienced guilds that actually dont recruit and or train any new members. I mean, i dont needed or wanted to learn raiding with like pros who carry someone through a raid. Just any guild who would help a new person to get into raiding would be enough. but like you said, most of them are like... gone. And if there are some, they often times really favour people who have more xp. 
---
For me personally, it wasnt like i didnt want to put energy in it. I was literally like 4 weeks on the golem, reading up on the mechanics of every boss, reading up on the meta builds and equip, watching video guides, before i even tried stepping into a raid. So its not being lazy, but more like being frustrated with random groups. 
---
The problem i see with random training runs is that, just as you get better at raiding you fail over and over on some bosses, not actually because you do something wrong, but either someone just completely fails (i mean its just normal for random beginner groups without much experience). Often times it was like that: Having a group, wiping on the first boss (because of someone who doesnt know the tactics, positioning etc.)  over and over, some people leaving, searching for new people and then repeat. Sometimes you get a boss down, but then everything repeats. But you have just so much time and will get frustrated. And then there is the weekly reset and you just have like 3 bosses down. That is just frustrating. I mean it actually would be much easier when guilds or groups took one or two people with them. Not to carry them, but to give them a more stable group. IMO you can learn it much better and faster. Its not carrying when someone knows what to do and just needs to experience the tactics how they should be executed in a non chaotic group full of people who dont bother reading the tactics.
---
For the fowsc and uwsc it was the same for me back then, watching videos, getting familiar with the build, the tactics etc. and then just going into a group. But getting a group was so much easier. If they wont take newbies with them, you could just say "yah right im experienced", get into the group and just do the sc without any problems. thats how i got into it.  
---
Not the same thing in gw2, because you have to ping shit to  your grinded that raids like crazy and people are really elitist about it. i mean, when gw2 started they just took people into the dungeons, when they had enough ap, like it says anything about how good i know the dungeon or smth.But gw2 sadly is just a vastly different game. And here you actually need to see things like at least one time, a video just wont show you the whole thing.
---
Weird, a guildie copied this from the terms (spelling is a bit misleading though):
---
\&gt; Eligibility: Win the MTM Special Ops Hypertec Guild Wars 2 Watch (the   
---
“Sweepstakes”) is open only to legal residents of the fifty (50) United   
---
States and the District of Columbia, Canada excluding Québec and the EU,  
---
 who are at least eighteen (18) years of age or the age of majority in   
---
their state of residence,
---
So, ultimately, it is Teapot's fault for not being willing to compromise. Got it!

"consider how you would feel if your brother, sister or friend worked at ArenaNet and was talked about like that" 
---
Id feel absolutely nothing. Oh NO! Strangers on the internet are insulting my mother, my brother, and wishes to my family cancer. WHAT DO I DO? HOW CAN I SLEEP TONIGHT?
---
Just a quick note here, if you haven't seen ERP 3 take care; there is a spoiler at the end of this video!
---
"I don't like professions based on pressing 3 skills"
---
Say no further hahahahaha.
---
Ele definitely fits this criteria
---
Tagged.
---
I honestly hated the floating cam, because most of the time it was all over the place, and when they did side by side, i could barely see what was happening, what classes they were playing and so on.
---
Either way i understand why anet chose to do this, if they allowed teapot to do it, then every other john and jane would use as precedent to do it too and then go ask them, and say why could teapot and not me? And you know where this would go.
---
Staff daredevil is fast and powerful and pretty simple to play.
---
Forget the erp, this is the amazing marketing we needed from anet.
---
This is more idiotic than the time reddit went on a which hunt because they thought the guy that made the directx 12 converter was trying to steal their accounts.
---
they are just searching for a reason to hate on this game because some of their wishes don't get fulfilled or something. I am not happy with the game neither but I just quit it and moved on. What's the point in just constantly shit talking it? I don't get it.
---
Its not devs, its employees, thats a big difference. Not all of them are producing content for the game.
---
I didnt remove anything.
---
It wasn't his fault, it was his decision. Neither party is to fault, they have their own rules for the partnership and since no common ground was to be found nothing was done.
---
Still, it did and will hurt Anet more in the end.
---
"The" ?
---
Legitimately a good clarification. Good to know interactions were amicable, compromises attempted to be made, but unfortunately rejected in the end for the sake of ToS compliance and quality of the event.
---
Also interesting to hear that there *were* talks of adding a "no downstate" mode for added fun that would have been implemented and supported by ArenaNet as well.
---
I'll admit I was pretty upset to see people so upset on both sides of this argument, and I chose to blindly blame Mighty Teapot myself for a bit, since it seemed his community and lack of communication was (at least, in part) responsible for the outrage. But, this genuine response has changed my outlook on that fact and, though it's inconsequential and irrelevant, I am now very sorry and wish to apologize to him for doing so. I've long enjoyed the content he put out and it's definitely sad to see him go, and I'm glad that I can rest easy now that it's on (mostly) good terms.
---
I hope some of the complaints can calm the craziness here and elsewhere in the community, and we can direct the complaints to constructive criticism and more civil arguments to perhaps revitalize or defend the raid community, and to request added features and support for such events from ArenaNet in the future.
---
The cake analogy is too hard for me to follow and i struggle with its dificulty.
---
Jokes aside, thats pretty much my story with this game as well.
---
Friends told me about this game, i watch wvw and pvp montages on youtube (vash bash and tsuki) as well as some wvw from the side as my friends played. Bought into the game only for my friends to quit shortly after (apparently the guilds on our server quit) and i found myself with nothing to do, without friends pvp and wvw was honestly unengaging so i do the lw and quit. 
---
Skip to hot around a week or 3 post hot and i jump back in, start doing fractals, we are wiping in aetherblade one like mad with some randos but we stick it through and afterwards i get invite to their guild, i spend the next 3 years with these ppl knowing them in and out of the game, doing from pvp to wvw to some raids and even dungeons. The highlight for me was the fractal cms and what largely solidified hot and se3 as solid mmo content and i was excited to move on to pof with them....
---
Then pof happened lol. Now with all my friends having quit i only log in for lw since im invested to  the lore of the game, funnoly enough i find myself logging in more often to gw1 with 1of my friends than gw2 atm.
---
Looking forward to the wow classic cake as well as some ff14 fluffy pancakes.
---
Which is part of why the raid community doesn't agree with ANet's reasoning. The community as it exists relies entirely on a third-party tool, ArcDPS, that was approved for use. Approving _another_ tool for use in the limited scope of a raid tournament was entirely within their power.
---
He said this hundreds of times on his stream before the tournament already, yet people still just shittalk.
---
Oh no, they need your name, phonenumber AND your email address. 
---
I wait for the day anyone makes a giveway where everybody just have to check a checkbox to participate. Nobody would be able to identify the winner or even sending him the prize, but it would be incredibly hilarious.
---
Thats a bit of a stretch .. as Tpot explained, the tool in no way affected the gameplay of the participants in any way and even asked for perms for the tournament. 
---
It is understandable but I believe a little push to bend the rules could've been made.
---
It's really pathetic the number of people who quit the game but continue to hang around just to badmouth it. Does this happen with other games?
---
Thread removed: Spamming is not allowed.
---
"semi EXP" groups are pretty much training runs and the commanders will often explain mechanics again anyway, or just ask that you've at least watched a youtube video on the boss or something.
---
other than that, your best bet is a PVE guild that does Raids often or the training guilds someone else already linked but i'm not a fan of those as it's a ton of hassle
---
Entered. That watch is awesome!
---
Gonna miss you, my dude. Have fun whatever you are doing, wherever. I still think your Thinking Man's Scourge video, is your masterpiece. The content, the editing, the hidden memes. Was just perfect.. ERP 3 may be a close second :)
---
They are the event organizers, Anet would only need to lay back and use it as marketing. They are the ones that needed to compromise.
---
They don't even want your address, dude. It's literally only name, phonenumber and email. That's the absolute minimum to identify a participant without "stealing" his data.
---
I hope you aren't insinuating that a 7-9 month gap between small-scale wings is an even remotely acceptable cadence for raiding content. Even Destiny has had a much higher cadence than that.
---
The gaps being that wide for the associated payoffs is exactly why ERP 3 is considered the raiding swansong - because nobody gives a fuck anymore.
---
I dont believe we need easy mode. Or, to be more precise, I think w/o any guide easy mode will be pointless as people will soon want to transition to normal mode with better rewards and still wont be able.
---
Hating something is easier than understanding it.
---
This post is not to take a stance, it's just to point out the two different viewpoints I have observed over at twitch in the last two years or so:
---
One side wants to curate their own audience and takes responsibility for any affiliated viewers, memers, people in chat and the general culture. For that, of course, one must assume that influencing your viewers is possible (with positive and negative reinforcement) and a good thing.
---
The other side emphasizes personal freedom and responsibility for ones own actions more. It's a more hands-off approach, almost utilitaristic. 
---
Whatever side you're on, I personally hold two opinions regarding all of this. Well, three really. 
---
1. Extremist positions always lead to extremes and suuuuck
---
2. By all means, put teapot more in one category than the other, I do too. But don't pretend like he doesn't try to do the right thing. That way, we can actually have a discussion.
---
3. This whole thing is a wonderful shitshow and no side is going to win.
---
Is there some kind of guide for maxing out your mastery points?
---
I guess only Anet knows which modes are worth to keep alive and which not. They probably have a lot of statistics what people play and if they spent money on the shop.
---
From a business standpoint its pretty normal to abandon stuff that makes no money, if my statistics say that people who raid spent no money at all in the shop then why should i make content for them.
---
The answer would be the same like now: temporary addon that served its purpose.
---
WAT?! Looks like I have to get back into it.
---
Any community that boasts theirs is the friendliest is probably lying to feel superior.
---
But the mismanagement is there because they decided to cater to the lowest common denominator
---
Damn Roy 👀 looking good 👌🏿
---
Absolutely, this game is like an abusive relationship to a lot of people which they can't let go of. Do I like the direction the game has taken recently? Not so much, but it doesn't completely ruin my experience with the game so I still play it. But I'm calling some of you out, seriously I know it's a meme at this point but if you are really unhappy with something then why stick around? It makes no sense. At all.
---
Daredevil is fast and good with power dmg. But it will require you to obtain the elite spec. 
---
Otherwise, an ele might be what you are looking for. They can have complex rotations but have a massive dmg potential.
---
No, that's actually not what i say here at all.  
---
I think most PvE players who don't raid are probably fairly casual, as raids are pretty much the only form of difficult content apart from fractal CM's, but that is not what my previous comment was implying at all. 
---
It is fairly predictable to see raiders kick back after years of insults and hostility from a part of the community that was hell bent on trashing raids from the word go, for entirely idiotic and delusional reasons. Now was that part of the community the "casual" playerbase? Parts were, of course. Other parts were probably annoyed PvP/WvW players. When you get generalized into the "toxic elitist" camp, it is not at all surprising to see those same people fire back with generalizations of their own, calling anyone who doesn't raid a "casual".
---
Scaling down some numbers would do nothing. People wipe because they fail mechanics and there are plenty of oneshot mechanics to be failed.
---
yea it does happen with other games aswell. In DotA for example, people spammed the subreddit with Dead Game 3 years ago already, yet The Internation 9 (Their recent, biggest tournament) had over a million viewers (highest viewer count so far) and the game still has millions of players. Develops patch the game, some players hate the new patch, quit it and think everyone quit just like them. Then they see one negative comment on the games subreddit or any other forum and just jump on the bandwagon and shittalk the game.
---
Really? I thought it made some fights like Dhuum extremely more watchable. But there were definite cases where one of the observers did seem off their game a bit in terms of controlling the camera.
---
Because it's all about raids, most hardcore content of the game played by about 1% of game community that is super toxic and vocal. From company point of view it's a waste of resources (and it's risky) to support someone who is not only salty but gather similar audience.
---
How? By toxic elitists leaving the game? That can only help ANet.
---
Good riddance to those assholes.
---
I guess it's comforting in a way that it's not a uniquely GW2 thing.
---
More like anet didn't want to come down to any compromise, since they didn't even allow the no downstate to be implemented (which already exists in wvw as event)
---
Only to those who are being toxic and elitist themselves. As soon as those guys are gone, I'll be done.
---
They also could have at least put some GMs doing the camera work if they are so afraid of someone having a camera mod with no one effects anyway.
---
This probably did more to advertise the game and the visibility, than all arenanet did in the last year.
---
I think the main focus of the dev staff should be on creating content, but we're not asking them to create events etc. - just to show some support when it's time to do so.
---
We don't know what they mean with their words 'features normally reserved for expansions'. Might not even be elite specs at all.
---
Hm, my apologies then for not realizing your involvement :/
---
My understanding, at least based off of what Teapot said, the relations were amicable regarding the situation and he himself seems to believe that it wasn't because it "wasn't allowed", rather it was because of developmental limitations.
---
I feel like there's a pretty big difference between not bending because of corporate policy and not bending because they just couldn't do it. Of course, I'll go ahead and qualify my statement by saying I probably don't have as much context as you do... but if Teapot explicitly tried to clarify that Anet wasn't at fault with this situation, why are you twisting it into such a negative connotation?
---
Start insulting yourself then since you fit into the category
---
I think it all really just comes down to timing right now; people are curious about 8/30 and doing whatever possible to distract themselves.
---
&gt; since it seemed his community and lack of communication was (at least, in part) responsible for the outrage.
---
I don't blame you for thinking that way, but maybe consider how fast the time is we live in. It's been barely a day since the ERP end. The twittersphere and online communities always want reactions *now*, and for a measured response it sometimes isn't possible. 
---
That is not to say the drama was unforseeable for teapot and he could have prepared better... but you live and learn, right?
---
Regarding the community reaction, just as a personal opinion... I still think it's understandable. Both in quality and quantity. Let's just leave it at that.
---
Bad operators, good technology.
---
Not really. Being toxic to toxic people is not the same as being toxic to everyone. So, yeah, you can fuck off with the toxic assholes who have no right to play this game.
---
Yes it was amicable, but still they didn't come down to any compromise, any solution proposed was denied.
---
He even went to the extent of doing all of the CMs with the accounts used to spectate the raids so that they wouldn't get any rewards, just to make sure to not interfier further.
---
This, it's even on the announcement page.
---
    It’s almost time for you to set out on your next adventure. Are you ready to catch the very first look at an all-new chapter in Guild Wars 2‘s Living World story?
---
In PvP/WvW, this would _absolutely_ give an advantage. WvW is the most obvious one; no need for spies or scouting if you can have someone with a camera hack zooming around the map, keeping tabs on all the zergs and checking all the swords. PvP is a bit more limited, but a bunker build being able to scan for rotations and then rotate themselves would be a notable benefit.
---
In PvE, this would be reasonably safe. An approved version would have to use restrictions like how ArcDPS build templates work (can't swap builds during PvP matches or when in enemy WvW territory). Those wouldn't be necessary when the hack is only being used by Teapot's observers during raid tournament matches, though.
---
because reddit will always have negative people, unfortunately
---
The trouble is that while some things may not make immediate money (raids, fractals, dungeons, WvW, PvP), they have the long-term effect of keeping people engaged in the game. Deprecating these game modes will lead to population decline, and eventually loss of profit.
---
It's sort of like the idea of SEO vs. advertising. They're both marketing functions, but one is focused on the long-term, and the other on the short term. They need to work in tandem, or the company won't be profitable.
---
You are a fellow Dota player too?
---
It's not unique though, this has been happening since HoT's launch. It quietens down for ~2 months after living world releases but then starts right back up again.
---
Yeah, not taking you seriously. That post history though, gonna be a major yikes buddy. Stay in school and grow up kiddo.
---
That one time when ANet went with a 3rd party sweepstakes company that included many random countries around the world did feel great. :(
---
That doesn't lead to the same comic, it only leads to the 3 panel version.
---
Your version has 4 panels.
---
Oh heavens yes. WoW, Rift, ESO, SWTOR, are the MMO's I have played enough over the years to still pop in to forums to see what is happening within those games.  I may no longer play most of them, but I constantly see people who claim they quit even years ago just waiting to jump at any opportunity to bash those games and insulting those that enjoy them.
---
I'm sure this is funny  but I don't get it, explain?
---
Ah yes. Poor, misunderstood ANet and GW2.
---
I saw that on a forum thread once. Made especially weird because the two people had opposing opinions so it looked like there was someone arguing with themselves until you paid more attention to the numbers.
---
[Alright](https://i.etsystatic.com/14449774/r/il/35546a/1577058044/il_794xN.1577058044_rnaj.jpg)
---
Great!  Thank you!
---
You know, I know you mean that as an insult. But in order for me to be insulted I would first have to care what you think.
---
This is fine for veterans but for people who never raided? This would be an unwatchable mess that only really made sense when some of them died.(even more so than first person)
---
&gt; I would bet money that most people who play this game have never paid for anything beyond the initial box price of the games, and possibly the gem price of the LS episodes they missed.
---
Seems like a dumb bet to me. Look at their history of releases in the past year or two. Outfits, mount skins, functional discounts, black lion key items, etc. 
---
Some people are using gold for these, sure, but there is a reason they decided to pack all the mounts into a singular box (or had the random mount ticket) before that. 
---
Even if 50% of the game doesn't pay, if 50% of the game spends gems on every shiny new thing that comes out - that can shift their priorities into developing more "content" for that latter group (which is exactly what has been happening) as opposed to WvW improvements or PvP improvements or raids that don't directly lead to income.
---
GW2 is a business and you can look at their business decisions to figure out what they value and what they think is important to increasing their bottom line, and right now that is pumping out new cosmetics for people to purchase on a regular basis. What does that say about how many people in the game pay real money for items?
---
At this point the hardcore community has no respect for Anet and its likely shared on the other side. There's a reason I'm still playing games with all my guild wars 2 buddies regularly but only actually log in to gw2 a few times a month. At this point the game is such a joke from the perspective of someone who doesn't play MMO's for single player story missions dripped out every 4 months, I don't see the point in people pulling punches. GW2 has seen its peak and Anet has made a lot of poor decisions post HoT
---
how about if its really for gw2 people make it an api key and then let anet contact you ingame so you can write them your contact data
---
A lot of people probably still play because they enjoy it just barely enough, but want to enjoy it more.
---
But games promote tournaments and community events all the time. Anet was even willing to do so conditionally.
---
ROFL
---
Wait for it....
---
.....
---
Hahahahahahahaaaaaaaa hahahahahaha...
---
Ok bro whatever you say, everyone but you is stupid. GLHF!
---
Bullshit. I'm totally on Anet's side with this. That hack cam is shit and it doesn't represent the game the way the makers want it to be.
---
Just feel bad for the one dude that innocently pointed it out.
---
I'd embarrassingly mis-click that far too many times
---
Isn't everyone?
---
Indeed it was a good call to not let go of the observer mode in exchange for ANet support. Normal camera mode would have ruined a lot, since it's way too close and inflexible.
---
This might be true, but who knows what their statistics say, if there isnt a big swing on the 30th and they keep going with what they do, there might be less wrong with the game than people think it is.
---
In the end only Anet knows whats best for them and the company and we might dont like it as a player, but thats just how it works, it cant go always like everyone wants it.
---
That's the joke.
---
It would be really cool if ANet could add a raid sandbox mode which disabled rewards but allowed robust spectate as well as optional challenge modifiers (more boss health, no downstate, class/build limits, etc). It would let the community put on awesome Raid events like this.
---
It would take a ton of work (no you can't just "port" the pvp spectate over), but it's something that enables the community to create value out of the game without ANet having to build everything. Maybe a cool feature to work on to go with the next expansion?

I need some help, it appears to me as a taco file not as a zip file and i put it in the pois and it does nothing.
---
Training guilds is exactly that though.
---
Now position yourself on the other side. Why would you waste your time to play with noobs when you can clear a wing in 30-60 minutes and go do something else?
---
I don't see how it's toxic when experienced people want to do their own stuff, but it's not toxic when others do it. Why would the former waste their own time if the latter don't want to do the same thing? Elaborate please.
---
It really would not be that hard to write that down in the TOS:
---
"For special events arenanet reserves itself the right to give temporary permissions to official arenanet partners to use third party software that enhances the viewer experience of said events. Permission can be given and revoked at any time without any reason stated. You can apply for partnership and permission [here]."
---
The end.
---
I'm agreeing with most of what you said (except for your repeated assertions that healing Engineer cannot do might or fury which is objectively false - it can maintain more might on 5 than FB can).
---
All I'm saying is that healing Scrapper has ludicrously good healing output and FB's raw healing is weaker than Druid, Renegade, Tempest, and Scrapper. Scourge is... different, and FB is probably better than WH Tempest on 5 but definitely worse on 10 because of the target cap. Scrapper in particular has some of the highest and most sustained raw healing output *in the game*, and Scrapper has or is very close to having the most effective condi clearing of every healing option in the game while also having multiple mass res options.
---
FB is meta in fractals because of aegis and stability spam combined with having a good offensive boon profile, not raw healing. The difference between is made extremely clear if you try out different off healers in raids like I have. In raids, aegis and stability application is much more surgical since you only need it for specific attacks and mechanics meaning other classes can handle it easily (compared to fractals where you want to spam it on the group at all times). That's the only thing I disagreed with you on, and I even said that Scrapper as a healer isn't that good overall in fractals.
---
You must not have played very many games.
---
As someone who's raided in other games but not this one, if you didn't know the fights it is just a big flashy mess
---
&gt; Even if 50% of the game doesn't pay, 
---
Then I'd win my bet. I said "most".
---
&gt; if 50% of the game spends gems on every shiny new thing that comes out - that can shift their priorities into developing more "content" for that latter group (which is exactly what has been happening) as opposed to WvW improvements or PvP improvements or raids that don't directly lead to income.
---
See that's where you're wrong. I just posted a thread about the gem store release frequency. They're really not pumping out tons more stuff, certainly not things that take a lot more time. WvW and PvP aren't suffering because the gem store team has been consistently churning out new outfits and mount skins (actually fewer of both of those over time, on a relative basis). What, do you think the Knife Tail Gang Contract took a ton of back-end coding? 
---
My point is this: yes, the gem store provides a lot of their money in the interim between releases, but they know as well as we do that long-term game health is driven by players being happy with the content they're receiving. Revenues consistently shoot way up when they release an expansion. I think you're really underestimating their ability to see who pays their bills and why. 
---
GW2 is already older than GW1 was when GW2 was announced. It's also more populated, has more endgame content (yes, it does, anyone who says otherwise is lying to themselves), has fewer exploitative builds, has more people playing together in PvE (which was effectively a single player game by this point), and more profitable. I think they know what they're doing better than you think they do. 
---
We'll see on the 30th, won't we?
---
Probs just something they diverted from tomorrow's gem-store announcement to impy "We're listening,"
---
Teapot created explanatory short video about it, go watch it. Basically they offered but agreement was not met.
---
I'm in one guild that I don't entirely need to be in mostly just to see how many people are in wvw. That's it. I don't even rep it because I think my character's name plate looks smoother without.
---
Otherwise I've never really played with a guild. I just add people to my friend's list. GW1 was the same way though so I'm not surprised.
---
Hehe, that's real cool stuff. It's interesting to see these things to occasionally break the "immersion" reminding that it's a game with some engine perks here and there. 
---
It reminded me of Valve's Source engine where some objects supposed to be non-visual (controllers or logical blocks of sort) were assigned weird models and then placed way out of player's sight, but since for most of games made with it it's "open" to break the bounds it didn't take long until people started finding those xD
---
Don't feed the incredibly obvious troll
---
Don't you dare say you're still enjoying the game, you'll be downvoted to oblivion.
---
It happens with most games.
---
&gt; You've been posting about it for at least two days.
---
Funny, since *you* have beed posting about it for two days (too). 
---
However, if you didn't know, that's how a conversation works. One person say something, another one answers, the first person answers to that and so on. So don't pretend that I "spam" you, when you willingly keep this conversation up. ;)
---
wonder how long it takes people to realize casuals make up 85% of a player base so they are incentivized to care mostly about them
---
Nope. I've had it since beta and have like 50 hours in it. The community at the time was so rude and abusive to new players that it turned me of from ever wanting to play it seriously.
---
In context of ToS it may be considered to be giving gameplay advantages against other players. Keep in mind I'm not discussing moral aspects or practical usage of those tools. Just reading the ToS it is very clear they are against anet's own rules.
---
Point is - if Anet wanted, they would help teapot. Because they could. They made exceptions in the past (mentioned above). But they didn't want to.
---
They really didnt though. The story path was the only part that was A, canonically relevant (And even then just barely) and B, expanded on the lore. And noone cares for the story path. As for the explorable paths, they didnt matter and really didnt expand on the world. Whereas fractals, well, they do in fact expand on the world and some do even canonically matter.
---
No because Teapot explained it.. Anet were completely fine with advertising it as long as the hack camera wasn't used. Its what happens negotiations break down although I am going to get political here if you are the UK this is when negotiations break down in a good way.
---
I haven't completed a single boss in GW2 raids and all the time i tried raiding was during first 2 days of Veil Guardian being in the game and for me it was rather easy to see what was happening especially with a great wing introduction in the beginning.
---
Although i might be way to hardcore for what you are looking at.
---
When I look at the opening post and at all the raging fanboys, nope, it *is* relevant.
---
Fucking reddit.
---
If there is a GW3, I hope they expand on a HoM like system. 
---
The introduction of the HoM really drew me back into GW, and made me feel like my progress and achievements in the game would really count for something - I didn't expect it to be a huge boost, but I did expect some genuine prestige and tools to help me get started in the next game, along with a nice monument to everything I achieved.
---
Except, you know, there's no monument at all. In exchange for countless achievements in GW1, I got some titles, a couple of skins and the exact same rubble as everyone else. 
---
It didn't even keep the flavour text commemorating my achievements. They already had a home instance system planned into the game - how hard would it have been to have a shrine or monument to my characters kick-ass ancestor? Maybe a few family heirloom weapons or something.
---
Not to mention that the Eye of the North was meant to be untold millennia old, predating all of the main civilisations, and kept itself magically intact and nigh-invulnerable - surpassing any understanding of the Dwarves or Asura - yet a couple hundred years later in GW2 it's in ruins for no apparent reason.
---
Why do you people keep bringing that irrelevant troll woman up. This is the second time today someone has said that hacks name.
---
EU can win something too, wooo. \\\O/
---
personally, i already watched MightyTeapot's clarification, and i agree with OP, so i'm not sure why you posted it
---
It's because I still play WvW but have no alternatives to turn to, there's no other game that has a equivalent that interests me. So instead, I only log into play with my guild when I can and continually am reminded how much potential this games wasted. We want the game to be better, but instead Anet pushes crappy living story content on an increasingly slow pace.
---
I donno, officially endorsing the use of a hack seems like a not great idea. It was great for entertainment value in this event and was not used maliciously, however it still has less savory potential. That policy is in place to prevent the widespread use of a hack and minimize awareness of those kinds of vulnerabilities. That being said, they do make compromises such as allowing arcdps and in the specific case of this tournament not banning players for the use of the camera hack. Sometimes they just turn a blind eye as long as things aren't malicious such as the recent d129pxy.
---
I'm sure that given the time and resources they could have put together something more official to use and I can understand why people are upset about the lack of extended support. At the least I think it's safe to assume Anet is having an internal discussion / exploring if it is worth pursuing support or not though that doesn't necessarily mean they will make changes. While 17k is pretty significant viewership for GW2 historically, it doesn't really translate into an actionable data point for marketing purposes without further detail.
---
So while a tweet seems harmless, the point people wanted one was to spread awareness of the tournament which would in turn spread awareness of the free cam hack. Ultimately this went against their policy against hacks *and* turning a blind eye to the use of relatively innocuous ones. It would have been cool if this was done with official support, though at the same time I can understand why it ended up not receiving any.
---
&gt;Funny, since you have beed posting about it for two days (too). 
---
I literally only learned about the event by browsing twitch, but alright my dude. ;))))
---
What? Doesn't he bitch about the game constantly?
---
They said they will announce LS5. Hopefully we will see expansion-tier content as well, as they promised. 
---
You can call it expansion showdown with just Delivery over Time.
---
Living story season 5 and the future of the live game so a hint at an expansion. I do also expect MO to say something about the game as a whole.
---
To be fair 90 % of the work on a new patch day goes towards multible dozen runs until the got most perfect rotation done and not so much on the actual theory craft...
---
As it happens I just redownloaded it a few weeks ago myself so I can confirm it's still around and working:

People who are enjoying the game are too busy playing it to come on reddit to see what the local mouthbreathing community's newest hot take is.
---
I'm not entirely sure what this video changes about what we already knew beforehand, other than that he's not personally mad?
---
I'm generally too impatient to sit around waiting for specific classes and people which ends up taking so long that I coulda finished it twice by then. So I always pugged T4 dailies in non toxic sounding groups or forming one with "noobs only" at the end and found randoms more often knew what they were doing and steamroll it anyways; unhindered by triharding.
---
&gt; everyone but you is stupid.

you certainly are a prime example :)

&gt; MT viewers: 15.9K

MT?
---
Taking that t3 keep away from BG on our home BL means spending an entire night fighting under AC's while outnumbered. It's the same reason Fire Keep is perma t3 BG every match. 
---
BTW, there's quite a bit of animosity between FC and JQ players because being stuck together means neither of us can fall out of T1. As far as population/activity goes: BG &gt; &gt; FC+JQ &gt; everybody else.
---
Prob not everyone knew this beforehand.
---
She represents the point where personal communication with ArenaNet dropped off a fucking cliff.  I don't enjoy talking about her, but ArenaNet still hasn't moved past her 4th of July nightmare.
---
It sure will help all those moms and dads who were looking for a "serious" kid-friendly online game to make their decision.
---
Than make an own thread about it? Or use one of the already existing ones. Stop hijacking other threads for your stupid raging. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBppsBNjHiI
---
Watch his clarifying video, Anet *did* offer support for ERP. Teapot rejected because he wanted to use his camera hack tool. End of the story. So please stop acting like an asshole now, thanks.
---
I agree here. It's still fun but I haven't played it hard in a while. Last time I logged in it was just starting to feel a bit dated, and it was also weird getting like 40fps in Mistlock Sanctuary with an 8700k at 5.0GHz and a 2080 Ti. I guess it's because it still doesn't really take good advantage of multi-core? Regardless, I'd be super down for GW3.
---
Some dudes are leaving the game.
---
This is basically what I said.
---
[Here you go.](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/dont-miss-our-special-announcement-event/)
---
Thanks for sharing, these were pretty good actually. Really helpful, specially for new players.
---
Sorry, but this is such a dumb argument on behalf of anet. If people do dumb things against the TOS, they get banned for a time. The end. It's such an obvious error that can be so easily avoided that it isn't even a problem worth talking about.
---
Yeah. I can't remember a memorable Norn who was part of the pact. Hekja and Havroun Grechen both die...
---
&gt; they've been very openly and deliberately retired by Anet
---
Took them a few years to admit it though, which was kinda sad.
---
and out of a sudden, a twitch event is a guild wars 2 event while the truth is that only around 60 players participated.
---
every hot meta has more players participating in game
---
&gt; WvW and PvP aren't suffering because the gem store team has been consistently churning out new outfits and mount skins (actually fewer of both of those over time, on a relative basis). What, do you think the Knife Tail Gang Contract took a ton of back-end coding?
---
You're missing the opportunity cost here. Skins could be added as rewards to other game modes, including PvP and WvW. This would be a natural way to get more players into the mode, as opposed to doing it with something that introduces a host of other problems like the Warbeast and then selling the Warbeast skins (instead of as a reward) on top of that.
---
&gt; GW2 is already older than GW1 was when GW2 was announced. It's also more populated, has more endgame content (yes, it does, anyone who says otherwise is lying to themselves), has fewer exploitative builds, has more people playing together in PvE (which was effectively a single player game by this point), and more profitable. I think they know what they're doing better than you think they do.
---
The ANET apologists are out in full force today I see. I get some of you guys are frustrated that people dislike the direction the game has taken. But you don't have to put on this fake air that ANET has done nothing wrong and the game is in an amazing state. It's just frankly not.
---
You should contact target and ask him if he could find an use for them for snowcrow's website. I'm sure there's a spot somewhere for them on the bosses guides.
---
Good work.
---
It's not for having loot boxes per se. It's for what their priorities are. Why do I have to clarify this?
---
&gt; Does this happen with other games?
---
Honestly almost every game series I play has a lot of people like this. Ironically the game I play with the most positive playerbase is a  gacha game.
---
I never claimed to be an expert, but, it's clear you're viewing this as a way to directly convert viewers into customers which, while nice, isn't what this would've been about.
---
This should've been abour ANET engaging with the community and growing the organic reach within the gaming community (whihh is massive on twitch obviously). They could've used this opportunity to further develop their brand loyalty equity and image as a developer who cares for the community and wants to foster a healthy and active playerbase. Instead they look petty people who will find any excuse not to support the community (they refused to support the community because of a camera hack.... Really?)

---
Okay, let me correct that. I couldn't knew that you stalked me and didn't answer to my actual comment. You know, like normal people would do.
---
If you were ANet you wouldn't give a fuck and would keep releasing low effort BL skins instead.
---
Egotistical fucks in a nutshell.

define bitching and give us examples.

What big content drop? When?

I've been waiting for wvw content drop for years, YEARS!?!?!?

Still nothing.

As a paying customer you have all the right in the world to voice your concerns and disagreement if parts of the product you bought are being neglected or abandoned. There is nothing wrong with that at all.

If an automaker tells you that after 2 years your built-in GPS won't get any more updates "because it's a feature that most owners don't use" even tho the car should last 10+ years, and you paid for it, and you like using it, you'd be pissy too.

Now, dont tease me that they actually cater to charr when they really just favor dress-up for human female characters. *sigh*

You are making the argument that JP drama and her fate are not justified. Hard to agree with anything you say after making such introduction.

Ah, yes. This mature expression of thoughts stands in high contrast to the twitch chat that you refer to.

People will hack the game regardles of this tool being used for ERP.

I mean same, I'm talking about the story expansions, wvw is a hardcore after thought in arena nets mind
---
I named my pet rock "Rocky"!

Because it's just wonderful to announce of a sweepstake like: 
---
- 1st place: No name
---
- 2nd place: No name
---
- 3rd place: No name
---
- 4th place: No name
---
- 5th place: No name
---
Or even better, should they publish their email addresses? xD
---
I’m mildly ok with that sacrifice. There’s stuff to do in the meantime. It’s better than a $15 a month subscription + an artificial gear treadmill keeping you playing for the next +100 stats. I built an ascended weapon years ago and it’s still BIS outside of convenience provided by Legendaries. There’s a content drought, but they’ve definitely provided solid, lasting content that provides a challenge.
---
I’m hoping we get a new expansion announced for the event, and that’ll be hype aF. I think they’re done with mounts, but wouldn’t be surprised if we see one or two (an underwater mount is highly requested) just like how in PoF we still used HoT masteries in certain maps.
---
looks good!
---
Well you're here so presumably you're representative of this mouthbreathing community. And ANet's lack of meaningful PR support and community building is.. a "new hot take"? This isn't 2013. Also you're implying that criticism of the game here is either unfounded or inapplicable to anyone who wants to play it. A statement that is so obtuse there's no sense in really addressing it.
---
&gt; That being said, they do make compromises such as allowing arcdps and in the specific case of this tournament not banning players for the use of the camera hack. Sometimes they just turn a blind eye as long as things aren't malicious such as the recent d129pxy.
---
I totally understand not wanting to endorse an event using third party hacks in advance. But I feel like this is a situation where someone should have looked at the spiking viewers on Sunday and said, "ok, we need to make a change of plans here and do something on the fly because this is a significant opportunity and we need to capitalize on it."
---
Thanks for the spoiler.
---
WoW is still going strong today. There's no reason this game needs to be winding down, and frankly, there was never a time where this game actually had a strong peak in terms of game quality
---
&gt;I guess only Anet knows which modes are worth to keep alive and which not. They probably have a lot of statistics what people play and if they spent money on the shop.
---
The problem with metrics and data in general is that it needs context, and ArenaNet has shown multiple times to not understand it; they said hard dungeons were not worth it because TA Aetherpath had flopped; ignoring the reason why it flopped was because of shitty rewards.
---
So, a game mode is underplayed? Well, then remove the resources. Why even bother analyzing why it was underplayed? Maybe because it didn't have enough resources in the first place. Why even bother trying to understand or fix things when you can abandon them and keep making new stuff over and over again until no one gives a damn about your unstable product...
---
His podcast seems to be mostly whining about casuals and how Anet doesn't support raiders, who make up an extreme minority of the playerbase.
---
Very concise and convenient way of conveying mechanics, reminds me of those language learning cards. May even be made into cool gaming cards if actual screenshots are added. Thank you for sharing.
---
This sub has a lot of casual players.
---
Just don't let the air spin the fan, it acts as a generator and the feedback voltage can damage a motherboard. I learned the hard way with a $400 Z99 board and canned air on a 200mm fan.
---
Again speculations. I am not enraged. Just because you feel like I am it doesnt mean its a reality.
---
&gt;  The fact that Anet didn't support the even is just another instance of them clearly not caring whatsoever about the community.
---
Even after teapot posted his video people still spread misinformation.
---
Yea because dungeons are not for casuals.
---
said the saint apparently
---
Unofficially from what sources?  The money that was donated was collected by the community over the course of weeks....??
---
Well a game with as good of a combat system as GW2 still hasn't appeared. I guess i have no choice but scream here.
---
Empyrean is a pretty big fucking deal. They're also inching towards The New War, which will likely involve end-game content.
---
Wouldn't surprise me, if people reporting this for "stiring up drama".
---
Story expansions, do you still not get it. People here are sick of story expansions, they don't want story expansions anymore as they are braindead 2h drops of most casual content that you can possibly imaggine every 4 months... That's the problem, that literary is the problem. Nothing is happening except for gemstore and story...
---
Uhh, no. BFA is much, much worse. In addition to butchering PVP by increasing the GCD, they also released with little to no content besides Rep grinds and World Quests (which is just rep grinds with extra steps and time gates). And then on top of that, they had the audacity to release Island Expeditions (**AP Grind v 2.0**) and Warfronts (**which were supposed to be PVP**) and claim that its content was good enough for a while. I'll give it some points for Siege of Boralus, but aside from that "it was a shitshow".  The last time there was any decent content was the release of Mechagon and Nazjatar, and that was a year after its release. On top of that, they are shilling out the ass with offering incentives to purchase a 6-month sub because they realized how shitty their xpac is and they're hoping that Classic is able to recoup their lost profits. MAYBE next xpac will be better, just MAYBE (if you subscribe to the "every other xpac is good" rule of thumb), but their attention will be focused on Classic for a while. 
---
So yeah, on top of paying like $60 for the xpac, then an additional $15 for every month you had hope that Blizzard would fix their fuckups, yeah, its not much of a comparsion. Meanwhile, GW2 is releasing Living World Content FOR FREE, with NO SUB FEE. So yea, BFA is shit and you shouldn't try to compare them, but idk when you started WoW so maybe you are a new WoW player and you're trying to compare them, but idk.
---
Dibs on the gold.
---
Press 1 on Fractal bosses - they pay better than world/bounties.
---
I mean that's all the casual fanbase cares about and the casual audience makes up 80% of the playerbase of any game so
---
Dude I'm not reading all that. Try to keep your replies a little tighter 👌
---
Yep, it's really tiring that raiders have been making these claims, when plenty of in-game participation involves many many more players-- and we don't have to make an event about it.
---
Well I'm told the dev chat on Cooking 500 had 1,200 viewers, while ERP had upwards of 12,000.   If the sticking issue is the use of a third-party mod, were I ANET, I would start trying to figure out how to incorporate/create that camera in game, and then they can officially support such events.
---
Find nine other people who play the game with you already, or are interested in raiding, and give it a shot. 
---
My first Raids came with a guild that wanted to start raiding for the first time. We had maybe two or three players who had ever done Raids before, and the rest of us were completely new. We spent a while bashing our heads against the brick wall that was Vale Guardian, only able to clear Escort for a while, and eventually we beat Cairn (with the help of old Chaos Chrono), our first non-Escort victory. It felt really special doing that with mostly inexperienced Raiders and friends.
---
We've steadily gotten better over the last year, but I wouldn't call us anything but trainees still. We're learning Raids together which is what I find fun. Rather than joining PUGs, or trying to join a clearing group right away, it's nice to be with others that want to strive and struggle together.

---
but how much of each currency would you have by simply playing through each episode?
---
&gt; Also, yes we have WvW &amp; PvP armour, but the three sets are locked behind gamemodes that require a fair level of skill and reaction speed
---
Not really. That is actually one of the problems with those game modes. They don't reward for skill so much as time spent playing.
---
&gt; As a paying customer you have all the right in the world to voice your concerns and disagreement if parts of the product you bought are being neglected or abandoned. There is nothing wrong with that at all. 
---
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it. But the term **moderation** comes to mind. Criticism is fine and all, but when it's the same shit over and over, people will and should get tired of hearing it. The energy and "passion" that they use when grabbing Anet's nuts and squeezing it is better off used elsewhere.  
---
&gt; If an automaker tells you that after 2 years your built-in GPS won't get any more updates "because it's a feature that most owners don't use" even tho the car should last 10+ years, and you paid for it, and you like using it, you'd be pissy too. 
---
That's not an accurate analogy. That automaker has had bad rep for the past couple years (in line with Anet's neglect) and that "feature" (end game content) isn't what makes them money. They'd rather focus more on decals and spoilers (gemstore) than improving your GPS.
---
Yes, I saw Tequatl was overloaded too.  We didn't not increase the player cap; we had too many maps on one piece of hardware (as TheTerrasque suggested in another reply).
---
Teapot has spent a month riling up his community with constant jabs at the devs and other streamers that are just enjoying the game, eg ridiculing aurorapeachy for getting the new hem skin. Anyone that doesn't shit on the game are branded filthy casuals on the subreddit, devs are harassed when they stream. Unfortunately this video doesn't do enough to quell the toxicity and animosity that he and his friends have so successfully cultivated from his 'memeing'. This event has a positive impact on teapot alone.
---
Yh I agree, fractals being more shortform content isn't even the case any more with the recent fractals being so much longer than the older ones, and with huge maps.
---
When they launch a new living story map they could put the effort into making a dungeon for it in that area. Put an armour set in it. Give it 3 difficulty settings, have a checkbox when you enter to time it and have a leader board for the normal and challenge modes, give a special reward to first clear and every time people break a record (a title would be cool like 'dungeon name envoy' for the first clear and 'dungeon name athlete' for anyone that breaks the time record).
---
Then casuals are happy, they get new sets with some story, and the ones that don't like fractals can enjoy it too, devs will get more engagement for the living story episode, and the more hardcore players get some new cm content and the leaderboards to fight over.
---
&gt; canada excluding (quebec and eu)
---
Given that the EU does not lie within Canada, I think the answer is obvious…
---
Are you serious? What has PvP gotten that was worth it? Hell, monthly tournaments are broken for 2 months now, SERIOUSLY?
---
It's something I've touched on before and it's drawn ire from certain areas of the player base that isn't all that pleasant so I'll happily pass on sticking my head more keenly above the parapets.
---
There have been plenty of posts showing the mining for drama and the subtle encouragement of the fanbase (which are the biggest issue - look at the recent threads and how they react to anyone dissenting from the echo chamber) to attack people that hold other opinions.
---
That they tend to be downvoted heavily isn't a coincidence.
---
Consider: If they promoted ERP, with the Tool, it would look like a "feel free to use this tool" and would drag a long list of problems with it because now people belive they CAN use it. It  forbidden for a reason.
---
bdo, tera,ff all do it well. alot of times its a 2 button push to get to further skills. and basically an aiming system  for like ground skills ect honestly the experience may not be the same but it would reach a much bigger audience.
---
Eh ... this seems like a terrible time to be porting the consoles since it's towards the end of life for both xbox and ps. I don't think a switch would run GW2 and it would require porting to ARM.
---
That's already possible in PVP.
---
Well they could have given tpot 2 accounts with spectate feature enabled officialy? You know, the one that GMs can use?
---
This knowledge was out there beforehand. He just didn't make a video about it.
---
I think their policy is fair/appropriate and while it's unfortunate they couldn't support this tournament for the use of the hack, I don't think they should waver on that policy. From the standpoint of operating a business and considering liability at least.
---
I mean they could have capitalized on it by banning the accounts involved to generate some controversy clicks :V The neutral / blind eye approach they took seems reasonable for the situation.
---
&gt;  GW2 you have to use the mouse literally everywhere. Selling, buying, using inventory/bank, you have to turn the camera often and so on.
---
That is a UI issue. You can make a different UI that is more appropriate for different control schemes.
---
It is very different from trying to shoehorn a controller into a game that doesn't support it.
---
Yeah i don't like the support style, just doesn't fit on me. I'd like more glass canon, seeing high numbers on screen.
---
ive been out the loop for a while they still having revamped? lol nvm then i was just watching a stream this morning missing the game.
---
I mean, Anet can make the complaints go. They just choose not to.
---
Instead they lie about Raid release cadence, take forever to release updates to 4 of their 5 game modes, and focus most of their resources into trying to shove loot boxes and paid skins down our throats with barely any new playable content that justifies that aggressive monetization.
---
I don't see how any of the negativity they are getting is undeserved to be honest.
---
Plenty of us bitched because we already played three neglected gamemodes (WvW and PvP and dungeons) and now ANet was adding a fourth, and we knew that would just pull even MORE resources away from content that we were still trying to keep relevant.   
---
ANet said 'no raids' at launch and that was a selling point to a big number of us. They went back on it and now we have FOUR neglected gamemodes because ANet never had, or never wanted, the resources to devote to them. What did you think was going to happen? I called it back then. I don't regret doing so and all of the bitching by raiders has absolutely cemented my opinion that introducing raids was an absolute mistake. They should have doubled down on WvW, PvP, and Dungeons.
---
His response was also super defensive. It just looked very fishy in the moment.
---
but muh fashion wurz
---
Lol np bud I certainly get that. Dark Souls does that to me. I’ve already 100% all the games in the franchises but I still go back semi-frequently.
---
never ever had a single problem.
---
&gt; logging in to fire off a couple tweets
---
Like JP did? After that shitstorm I wouldn't trust anyone to make any tweet, even about office's hamsters workout routine lol
---
Do...do you think their Twitter is just some dude who can tweet whatever they want from their phone?
---
That thing is official. Especially if it's contradicting a previous policy, there is no way that's happening in the spacr of a day, especially on a weekend.
---
Well there you go, ele is the quintessential glass cannon, I think youll enjoy tf out of it (I know I do)
---
The issue wasn't even that he was in n the commander's shadow. He just got angsty. He was portrayed more as a young man rather than a Norn.
---
&gt; Edit 2: as /u/Dartwo pointed out, he also encourages people NOT to bash Anet.
---
&gt; As Teapot himself said on Twitter: "Let's keep the ERP as being a wholly positive celebration of the game. No need for negativity friends - enjoy the moment, I know I certainly am lol"
---
Hmm so that was posted separately from the "clarification"? Hard to tell if he means that or if it is just a "covering his ass" statement.
---
Indeed, there are a lot of changes that can be made. However, they all require real work not "tweaking some numbers". Creating an easy mode isn't really different than creating a hard mode in regards to the amount of work needed.
---
The giveaway links no longer work at the moment.
---
One little-known feature of the current gen home consoles (PS4, Xbone) support keyboard and mouse input. However, few games on either console support keyboard and mouse for gameplay. This is slowly changing, with some AAA games like Metro Exodus on Xbone having native k+m support already, and more games surely will follow.
---
Perhaps a console port of GW2 wouldn't have to have strict controller support at all, though not having good controller support will definitely hinder the game's adoption on consoles, since many (if not most) console gamers still prefer to play on their couches.
---
I am aware, I meant for the instagram post, but you did the edit and said it is no longer there. You could upload and post the screenshot though.
---
Communication with anet became a pipe dream when hot came out, that’s when devs cut ties
---
GW2 was never meant to be hardcore.  GW1 had a relatively small following, and it would have been fine if GW2 was the same way, then raids happened and you got snobby people from WoW coming in and attempting to make GW2 hardcore, which failed obviously.
---
&gt; Ironically the game I play with the most positive playerbase is a gacha game.
---
Well presumably most people playing that already knows what they are getting into.
---
Unlike GW2 where you have people picking up the game and just assuming it is going to be the same as every other MMO(such as grinding mobs for exp). Some people also seem lost without a gear treadmill pulling them along. Some people just need the illusion of progress.
---
&gt; i wish this game would come to console
---
There is no console capable of running GW2 at a decent frame rate. The CPU in both the PS4 and XboxOne is an 8-core AMD Jaguar. So, essentially an 8-core Athlon. 
---
* PS4 - 28nm version @ 1.6 GHz
---
* XboxOne - 28nm version @ 1.75 GHz
---
* PS4Pro - 16nm version @ 2.13 GHz
---
* PS4Slim - 16nm version @ 1.6 GHz
---
* XboxOneS - 16nm version @ 1.75 GHz
---
* XboxOneX - 16nm version @ 2.3 GHz
---
On the GPU side, 
---
* PS4 uses a 28nm "Liverpool" GPU from AMD which supports DirectX 11.1 and has 8GB of GDDR5 memory. In processing power, it's roughly equivalent to a GTX-470.
---
* PS4Pro uses a 16nm "Neo" GPU from AMD which *does not support DirectX* and has 8GB of GDDR5 memory. It's almost as powerful as a GTX-780.
---
* XboxOne uses a 28nm "Durango" GPU from AMD which supports DirectX 11.2 and has 8GB of DDR3 memory. It's almost as powerful as a GTX-285.
---
* XboxOneS uses a 16nm "Durango 2" GPU from AMD which does support DirectX, but has only 1/3 as many cores as the PS4Pro GPU, uses 8GB of DDR3 memory, and is slightly less powerful than a GTX-650Ti.
---
* XboxOneX uses a 16nm "Scorpio" GPU from AMD which also supports DirectX, has slightly more cores than the PS4 GPU, and has 12GB of GDDR5 memory. It's roughly equivalent to a GTX-980.
---
So, while the PS4Pro and XboxOneX one have fairly decent GPUs, all of the other GPUs are trash and all of the CPUs are flaming garbage by 2019 standards. GW2 is a *heavily* CPU bound game and will not run smoothly on a CPU that weak without a complete rewrite of the GW2 engine.
---
Well, would you say you got good value for your $60 USD after those 5 years? That’s what I base it off. It’s sad there’s nothing to do anymore for veterans, but for me it’s like Assassin’s Creed, you play till you feel you’ve completed everything and move onto a next game until a new expansion launches.
---
I’m on mobile right now. So a bit difficult to do atm.
---
i mean thats what happened to wow, it was designed for hardcore players and then they realized that you cant please the hardcore players that make up a small percentage of the game, but the casual playerbase loved every update they released so they decided to focus on the casuals. To this day WoW live is the most popular and successful mmo because of that, as much as the people on reddit dont want you to believe lol
---
F2p don't get to participate it seems. My alt account is f2p and killed at least 3 Champs with my level 80 char on it, and no reward.
---
WoW was not designed for hardcore players, lul. Compared to EQ at the time, WoW was very casual.
---
I mean it's like three raid devs, story and open world has around 200ish in comparison :)
---
My first toon is a Norn and at the low level bear shrine, you could pick up the fish to feed them to the cubs. I squeed and took many screenshots of my girl holding the fish close to her chest. This was before they nerfed that particular bundle with the new player experience. But in general, I really liked the bundles they had in the game.
---
I don't get your argument here. They used the tool anyway, it wasn't shared or advertised. Do you think people will now flood google looking for it? People who want to hack the game will do so, they have many other tools, better tools to cheat in pvp or wvw. Free camera tool was just an easy excuse to not give support for the event.
---
No. WoW was designed for casual players. That's literally been the design intent since day 1.
---
The call to chill is about them not supporting it. That's reasonable. I can't fault their stance on that.
---
I can fault their sheer incompetence and lack of capability to deliver any form of meaningful content or show they have any idea what they are doing as game developer besides milking the gem store. This event just shows it even more because you need a hack to reasonably watch the game in a manner that shouldnt be a problem to begin with. People have bitched about visibility and the sheer cluster fuck that is the visual clairty of GW2 since its launch. It continues to only get worse.
---
What long term? There is no long term. All content other than living story is dead.
---
Just give the server names. Your "server A" and "server B" nonsense is needlessly complicating things.
---
i mean i didnt like wow back then and dont like wow right now, ill be the first to admit that minus PvP im a hardcore casual at mmos, i dont want to grind, i want my skill to make me better than the other guy not gear. The only reason i play GW2 is because it has the best pvp mechanics in an mmo imo and fashionwars is my actual addiction. youre also deviating from my original point of people bitching that the game is "dying" because they are ignoring the hardcore fanbase when Arena Net stopped caring about that fan base a long time ago because you cant please them but all they need to do to make me happy is give me a pretty dress and im all in.
---
The most successful games currently are competitive PvP based games, that fully milk the casual audience while presenting a hardcore endgame ideal that the majority of players never get to.
---
The issue is that GW2 and other games like this are PvE focused, and the development of this type of game does not mirror a PvP game directly. However, it can be, there are ways to support both causally playing characters and hardcore players, like other MMORPGs or similar lifestyle games do. 
---
This discussion can get very complex, but /u/N_Pitou (is that a HxH reference), that statement is only accurate if you're looking at it from a surface level perspective.
---
Because they made the tool.
---
&gt; If youre calling WoW classic as a casual game then youve never played it when it released.
---
On the internet, we have this amazing super power called "anonymity" that allows us to make baseless, hypocritical statements about something we know nothing about. For example, this.
---
The watch bears the GW2 logo, so 99.9% sure it's just their marketing dept. that misunderstood LS5 as "new game". What do they know, after all…
---
Hmm that's odd. It should create a log. Try executing the script from the terminal and see if it throws any errors.
---
Out of those I've only played Tera and FFXIV at a decent length and I only played TSO in the beta so take this with a grain of salt:
---
Those MMOs have a way different combat/movement feel. Things are a bit more rigid and translate to a gamepad relatively easily. I don't think GW2, beyond a level of very casual enjoyment, feels quite right with a gamepad setup for the core gameplay loop of combat.
---
Or rather: It could be made to work well on consoles, but I'm worried that they would make compromises which lessen it from what it is now.
---
and this!
---
i agree with you 100% and 99% of people will only look at it from surface level. also yes it is
---
Well, it would make sense if keyboard and mouse devices for consoles  were more widespread, but some games even forbid them instead.
---
I know people can get very good at using a controller for games that are way easier to play with KB&amp;M, but why doing it when the mouse works better?
---
Nope sure dont not anymore.
---
Yup
---
You still need to input text. Controllers are way slower at it, even with 'easy' input methods like the text input in Steam's Big Picture mode.
---
The WvW community never forgot, that's for sure.
---
Well, better ask ANet to fix it than.
---
Lack of content - like that new raid wing that came out not even three months ago?
---
Fucking toxic raiders.
---
:)
---
I'm not into raids and I was caught off guard at how much negativity this subreddit was posting last night.
---
The kinds of criticisms this place has for Anet can be extremely misguided. I mean, I saw people saying we had a "content drought" no more than a month after the most recent LW chapter had come out.
---
I played it for a couple days when I stayed at an older cousin's but my parents refused to pay the monthly fee, since then I've played 3rd party servers a fair bit casually, I plan on doing the same with the launch of the classic servers as well as I work with a half dozen people who played it religiously since classic and have been helping me figure it out so I like to think that I qualify enough to have an opinion
---
Wow you really are a corporate bootlicker lol
---
But you were specifically criticizing their revenue model.
---
It's very hard to have the perspective to separate the casual vs hardcore issue, the overall popularity of the game, splitting of dev resources, overall vision, NCSoft pushing for certain practices, etc. Because it's hard to step back, it's hard to predict ANets overall intent.
---
I don't think I have said perspective. However my gut reaction tells me that ANet definitely appreciates and understands the benefits of a hardcore minority and would like to structure more content for them. It's why they keep announcing plans on working and various hardcore elements of the game. However, the pipeline priority is always that immediate gratification of a casual cashflow source (and it needs to be). This hurts the long term interest in this game. Ofc, that's all supposition.
---
If it was a typo they could just edit the post
---
Imho if you have no hardcore players you have no reddit, no streamers no vocal community. For new players from outside it looks like a dead game. Especially if you make no real advertisement. Additionally with that slow addition of content you lose casuals too because they often switch games and never look back.
---
For a seven year old game this is very risky and I love that game and will not see it fade away. I think you need a fair balance.
---
As aways the truth gets downvoted on here...
---
i agree, it doesnt help when new players go to reddit and all they see is whining
---
still dont care
---
Aw you can't read
---
There are 10s of us.
---
man qq more
---
It seems like it should be a pretty simple thing for some PR speak to clarify though. Just tack the language on as a visible disclaimer on the stream and promotional materials. I still think ANet goofed and missed a good opportunity to work with Teapot here. Exceptions to the rules are sometimes very much worth it. 
---
'Through a collaboration with the ERP team we've approved use of a third party camera tool specifically for this tournament. Use of this and similar tools is still against our terms of service and is only permissible with the express consent of and collaboration with the Guild Wars team.'
---
You say after Jahai and Dragonfall? Kourna wasn't great but most of the LW4 maps are extremely good.
---
But they aren't producing the content that ***I*** want in the timeframe ***I*** want it in, therefore Anet has personally insulted my entire ancestry and is killing this game. /s
---
I get it. Content droughts fucking suck. It's part of why I dropped WoW during Warlords. But when a staff is depleted due to layoffs like Anet's, content creation has to get triaged based on how many people will meaningfully consume and enjoy the content. With the raiding community as insular as it is (and trust me, I've tried every thing that ever gets suggested on here to get my own foothold into raiding with fuck all success minus starting my own learning groups), it isn't logical to dedicate a majority of development time to that content. It gets worked on as people have time, and rolled out when ready.
---
I'm the sort of player that only plays MMOs to raid. When Warlords was both a grindy shitshow *and* the raiding wasn't great, I left. When I got replaced in my FF14 static because the raid leader wanted their real life friend in the static instead and I had no raiding home, I bailed. GW2 is weird in that it feels *okay* to not raid, and that combined with the very hard-to-break-into raiding scene means that a lot of people are gonna say "who cares?", which will lead Anet to prioritize other stuff.
---
But logic is hard, especially when emotions are hot. It is what it is.
---
He's flaired as Tarnished Coast, the NA RP server. He probably can't read.
---
I'm very much a fan of male Asura. Great voice acting, really fun animations. But it's literally personal preference, it doesn't impact anything beyond animations basically.
---
&gt; While 17k is pretty significant viewership for GW2 historically, it doesn't really translate into an actionable data point for marketing purposes without further detail.
---
Also not particularly interesting unless it is something repeatable. Would the numbers have been the same without the whole leaving thing? Since this is ERP3 ... what happened with 1 and 2? Would it have gotten the same amount of attention without the drama?
---
&gt; Hmm so that was posted separately from the "clarification"? Hard to tell if he means that or if it is just a "covering his ass" statement.
---
Well, he didnt bother too much with chat moderation during his stream, so he was obviously was fine with it. Sure, there were some positive celebrations (mostly about themselves) but he disregards the negative clown fest that was going on.
---
FF XIV handles relatively well with a controller but it was designed that way from the beginning. Very customisable.
---
You being from NA doesn't really matter.
---
The streams were actually shown during prime NA times.
---
I like the idea actually and they should be able to do it
---
i mean we allready got new items with different new rightclick options so they just could give us an option on the rightclick menu to open a choose dialog and doubleclicking does the usual stuff
---
the choose dialog could be like on the portal tomes and instead of porting it just sets it as the default option.  
---
they could even give us 2 options one for default setting and one for porting
---
rly good thinking mate
---
And then, once we review it, it'll be right back up again. Mass-reporting doesn't work here, we check those things.
---
Good sourcing in this comment, take my upvote.
---
What's he supposed to do exactly, spank em?
---
By all means, they shouldnt. But why do it during a live-event organized by their favourite streamer while he asks them not do bash on Anet and instead celebrate the event itself in a positive way?
---
Because nobodies feeling positive. Anet has done little but neglect its core community, giving just enough to not abandon modes but not doing enough by miles.
---
So, could mods just remove drama threads now? All those dozens of them accusing devs if not giving a shit? They stick out there proudly with hundreds of karma from imbeciles, scaring new players away.
---
It doesn't appear to be working for me sadly.

This would be great!  I'd also like to see the Mystic Chromatic Ooze added to the tonics.  I'm sure there are other similar items that could be added too.

Your tongue in cheek tone was not misunderstood.
---
They are just trying to technically correct you instead of responding to  your point.
---
Protip: People who technically disprove others are well loved and successful at life!
---
Well, I always ask for pots but never for food/l.p./other Pots are giving HUGE bonuses.
---
Only if lower level leaders aren't empowered to make decisions on their own. This sort of calcified, calculating, cynical interaction with the community is the "norm" to some extent, but it's not necessary or good. Paying customers don't want that soulless bullshit.
---
Now, there needs to be guidelines, so that the PR team isn't promising that the next expansion will be able to make your characters real and you'll be able to literally marry them, or spouting off that Ireland will never submit to British oppression or some divisive political opinion, but if a company doesn't authorize an employee to retreat a twitch stream, it is poorly managed.
---
&gt; dual professions (like that one wvw weekend)
---
I'm just gonna leave this here but --- 
---
Why do you think they made that event?
---
*disappears in a cloud of smoke*
---
Being technically correct is the best kind of correct.
---
Erotic Role Play 3. Braham does Marjory.
---
A lot of folks here hate on laptop performance. It is never going to be comparable to a desktop. If you are fine with subpar visuals, you can play the game comfortably. I regularly play on a laptop with a ryzen 5 processor and 16gb of ram, without a discrete graphics card. It is not optimal, but certainly doable.
---
What it does it make them look bad, because their game is shit to watch without it and the community does a better job using unauthorized tools than they can. Caring about the tos at this point is just whiteknighting, Anet's house is burning down. Unless they deliver a unexpectedly good presentation Friday , they're fucked.
---
I doubt that and I doubt that dressup guys will get you new players or hold casuals. Don’t get me wrong, Fashion Wars is great but focusing only on that is in my opinion a failure. Coming up with what is the meaning of your guild banner after 7 years while the biggest community event of the year is going on, is friendly sad very clumsy.
---
Way past discussion imo, it's been years since all of this started, this is just the result of silence.
---
Being frustrated and critical =! hating anet for no reason.
---
Anyone who \*thinks\* Anet has given a fair amount of attention to competitive game modes compared to Open World is 100% wrong.  That is what has caused frustration and we're not taking 1 day of frustration for some game modes it's **years** of frustration.
---
While I'm not saying it's **right** to be overly toxic and basically unconstructive but there's **plenty of reasons** to be toxic and basically unconstructive.
---
I'm in the dark on what this ERP thing is / was, but it sounds like someone went to a bunch of trouble to create a kick-ass community event, and now people are upset with ArenaNet because... why?  What does one have to do with the other?
---
&gt;From the standpoint of operating a business and considering liability at least.
---
There is literally no liability here. I would advise a business against letting children swim in a swimming pool without parent permission, as that is an unexploded land mine level of liability, but a video game company letting someone use a mod for better camera support doesn't carry liability.
---
MTM - "So you guys make games huh? And you're celebrating and want a promotion?"
---
&gt;We are excited to announce our partnership with Guild Wars 2! In launch for their new game coming out
---
Anet - No no no that's not it.
---
MTM - Aren't you a game company, don't you make games?
---
Depends on resolution and aimed framerate. I'd lock to 30, drop as low as possible and enjoy smooth gameplay.
---
mine was correct so they must ahve updated
---
&gt;I'm the sort of player that only plays MMOs to raid.
---
Okay sorry to tell you that: GW2 is not the right MMO for you. The Endgame here was never about raids.
---
I'm not saying anybody should force themselves to play something they don't like. However, if you're agreeing with the statements I was making, and think that ANet wants to go hardcore, they don't have enough resources, then not playing/making the odd purchase doesn't help at all.
---
Again, if you don't like the game, don't play it, I barely touch it anymore. I just think it's a bit misingenous to say that not playing is supporting the game and dev team.
---
&gt; Because nobodies feeling positive.
---
teapot said in that video that he has no hurt feelings about Anet, so there is at least one.
---
&gt; Anet has done little but neglect its core community, giving just enough to not abandon modes but not doing enough by miles.
---
I know **why** these people have negative feelings towards Anet, my question was why voice them during a stream by their favorite streamer where he wants to create positivity?
---
I'm not crying, you are! :cry:

I wish you didn't include Brazil in this video. Yeah, I get it, he made shitty build guides at one point but seriously he did more harm for this community than any other figure.

So this is how Teapot's time in GW2 comes to an end; with thunderous applause.

yeah, more art posts

Best comment.

Is this some sort of inside joke to call it the "ERP tournament". I know what the acronym is now, but you could imagine my confusion from the dashboard as someone who doesn't play GW2 anymore.

a fitting ending

Nice try Brazil &lt;3

Exceptional. Teapot has been a good lad, and all the best to him as he goes into Classic WoW and the rest of his life. 
---
Guild Wars 2 has been a large chapter of our lives for a lot of us, but few have touched so many peoples lives in a positive way as Teapot. I’m glad I’ve known him, and I really hope our paths will cross again maybe in New World, or whatever exciting new games come out in the future.

No, they just have no idea what they're communicating: [https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/win-a-guild-wars-2-mtm-special-ops-hypertec-watch/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/win-a-guild-wars-2-mtm-special-ops-hypertec-watch/)

Ofc i dont aim for 1080p ultra with this config, but how low should i think? 720p all on low / disabled?

Went do need better tool tips to help new players understand what is going on and it's good for vets because we get quick updates  for combat.

RIP Mr. Teapot :'(
---
i dont mean supporting the game but i cant pay for something i dont enjoy just to give them a couple extra dollars in hopes they fix it. if the game shuts down tomorrow i might be sad but im not going to lose sleep over it. Honestly more than anything i would like to see a GW3, i like the idea of starting over from scratch with all new content especially since i basically skipped all of PoF but i know im in the very small minority on this one so im not holding my breath. It also doesnt help that i have no IRL friends to play with soooo
---
GW2 might go, but the memes and the memories will live forever.
---
Godspeed Teapot.
---
Thank you soo much Teapot and everyone who was ever involved in your streams, in teatime and especially the tournaments. ERP 3 was the most insane and thrilling community event in the game, I enjoyed every second watching it :)
---
Thank you for carrying me through W4 - W7 through knowledge I gained from your VoDs, and thank you for actually carrying me a few times when I randomly joined your LFG groups :D (W5 with you and the guys was definitly one of the best raid sessions I had as a pug raider)
---
Keep up the amazing work on your stream, you will always be welcome in this community! :)
---
They're the same person, and Marius Bota is his more used name for online presence.

Zaaaack of suckatloovee. The mvp we got but didn't deserve.  ♪♫♬

Thanks for the dank memes during the years. Really. &lt;3
---
&gt; and actually would help inexperienced players to gain experience
---
this is what i'm referring to. you shouldn't expect anyone to spend time and effort to help you learn raids. you can start a squad, get 9 other beginners, and learn together.  
---
stop expecting "elitists" to help you out.  
---
  
---
&gt;But the toxic comments and downvoting mine into oblivion actually just proves my point  
---
PeOPLE dIsaGrEe wiTh Me, ThEREfOrE I aM rIgHT
---
GW2 now playable on watches.
---
I used to think this way too. May I present to you: 
---
Warframe. It's been fascinating to observe and interact with the subreddit these past few playin that I've been playing it. They are a case and point example of a very casual focused game when it comes to players. They make their money primarily through new players and casuals. Anyone deft enough to navigate the game and become "hardcore" will never need to spend a single dime. So, just like TP Barons. Then, remove raids, dungeons, fractals, PvP, and WvW from the game. Boom, you have Warframe. And they're making money hand over fist. You go on the subreddit and you will see are exactly what I said in my previous post "fashion, screenshots, memes, new player guides, etc."
---
The success of a game is much more nuanced then casual vs hardcore.
---
Oh ok. In that case, nevermind my comment.
---
Yup, and pretty much confirmed with the deleted post and replacement that /u/ReLiFeD shared: https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cvtwaz/so_uh_new_game_coming_out_huh/ey6dkdh/
---
Imagine using a sockpuppet account to stir drama on reddit, never heard of before. Bonus points if this it's by someone on the "elitists" side just shitposting as the opposite opinion to make the other side look bad.
---
But yeah, this thread smells like obvious bait and should've remained locked.
---
The UI in FFXIV is designed to work really well with a controller, so no issues there, but the feel of the game differs a lot from GW2. I've played GW2 on a controller and it indeed mostly got down to stuff like chilled map completion or something similar. Once, just for fun, I tried VG as the chrono tank using a controller, and, while possible, I'm not willing to try that again. In my personal experience GW2 is just too dynamic to translate properly to a controller.  
---
Also, due to their programming, choice of language, and age of their engine (keep in mind the base of the engine is from 2005) actually porting it to a console might require much more work than you expect
---
Curious if these are new or old job descriptions. They did have at least one or two other titles in the works before the layoffs and while one was most likely mobile it's possible the other was multi-platform.
---
I know some don't agree with this but I personally believe that GW2 going to consoles would be an incredible thing. It worked out really well for Star Trek Online and while GW2 has more competition in the fantasy MMO space I personally think it could become very popular on consoles.
---
But like other MMOs it would require a massive amount of work to convert the game to controller.
---
This was the original intention, good to hear, cheers.
---
&gt;I hope the video can calm the craziness here and elsewhere in the community, and we can direct the complaints to constructive criticism and more civil arguments to perhaps revitalize or defend the raid community, and to request added features and support for such events from ArenaNet in the future.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;EDIT: Also, seeing the responses in this thread, it's really a shame that the only voices who came out to Reddit or in-game prior to the event or this video were those ready to point 100% of the blame at ArenaNet's "lack of interest or support for raids or the community." It sounds like Teapot had covered this topic before on streams and such, but those who weren't there to hear it from his mouth were left only with the memes and the mob which really didn't portray the events or outcome in a truthful way at all.
---
The constructive criticism is "Stop acting like assholes about the camera, and support your own community." r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM is as intellectually and morally bankrupt in video games as in every other aspect of the human experience.
---
ANet had a choice to help support a popular and interesting event, and declined to out of a slavish obsession to bureaucratic nonsense about the TOS.
---
You do know an announcement about more cake is coming in under 4 days right?
---
yes please
---
They just scrapped multiple projects and reshuffled the staff and let a lot of people go. If there is a new game on the horizon, it's at least in the development hell stage as of February. I wouldn't be surprised if any new projects are still a couples years or more away.
---
You do know that instances don't go over 500 players (not even sure if they go that high) So no, no in-game participation can reach the 17k twitch viewers the stream got.
---
Functionally Undeveloped?
---
Gw3 would be the Kiss of death for anet...Splitting even more the community.
---
- as gw3 get anounced gw2 Will get a massive player drop.
---
- most people will just go to ff14.
---
- its like getting a Server wipe, imagine you getting that on current gw2... Yeah thats how it will feel. And you have to pay for it... All for better grafics (that this engine can deliver but since is a mmo it is smart not to do it), a diferent combat that can split even more the community and what new story?
---
There is no positive in that. Like it or not a sequel to a mmo is almost aways bad. GW2 was a Lucky move and there is no technology leap that justify gw3. 
---
Ex of what im Saying... 
---
Everquest 2... Massive players at start, now barely existes, the original have a bigger community. Same with lineage 2 (it is even less proftable for NCsoft). Asheron's call 2 (yup there is a reason that you didnt even remembered this game existed) 
---
Ff14 only get a pass because people Will buy anything with a chocobo in it and square knows it.

**ArenaNet:** We can't break the rules.

**Also ArenaNet:** We make the rules.

Achievement hunting is not content.
---
Colin gave us HoT, with the Desert Borderlands and Stronghold. He also sold us the "three layers" of the jungle, and we all know how well that turned out. HoT was an overall mess.
---
Don't you guys have watches?
---
People can't use it because no one outside the ERP casters has it. It's not publicly available.
---
In any serious game, this camera tool would be called an addon. Here, it's a hack/exploit. It's bullshit.
---
Ehhh 3.5/10. I get it, but it’s a little rough.
---
This is a super nice community, there's no toxic disagreeing here! We're all aboard the happy train!
---
You forgot the History channel logo in the corner.
---
Not for dual profession testing because that would be the most worst way to introduce such a system.
---
Pretty obvious to me they did it to find ways to spice up WvW since it, by default, is the "balanceless pvp". So they needn't bother to figure a good way to balance multiple professions' skills being used at once.
---
Wish the game had some sort of raid journal like WoW does, describing the bosses and such. Having to go outside the game to learn about raids is a huge psychological barrier for a lot of people :I.
---
MFW there's actually a new mobile game coming in.
---
*Screams of terror*
---
I am still amazed this show lasted 14 seasons.
---
&gt; Only way to regain trust is to focus your effort on consistency.
---
Well, for quite some time now, they've been rather consistent with Open World/Story releases. To the point, actually, that people were complaining that it's all the same and repetitive.
---
They've also been quite consistent with not focusing on PvP, WvW and Raiding. Should players be happy about it? No. Is it surprising? Honestly, no - all the sings have been there.
---
Would've players liked better management and more communication? Yeah. Is it realistic? Not really. Because - column A - that's just how their business turned out to work, like it or not, and column B - because, let's face it, even *if* they spread too thin (and they did), no way any large company would ever go out and say "Look, here, we're cutting all support down on this modes because not enough people played them and they didn't bring money so they weren't worth the effort." That's, uhm, large company marketing in capitalism? They aren't an indie who can pull it on feels alone.
---
Hopefully, yes, Season 5 announcement will be clear enough so that *even if between the lines*, each community within GW2 will get what's coming. We know what it most likely will be, though, so... I don't think posts like these will turn tides for many anyway.
---
So I haven't been playing GW2 in a while, but I'm curious of the recent raiding party. Anyone has links to the VOD?
---
So then it's logical to double down on content that is completed in a few hours and comes every 4 months with low replay ability instead of repeatable content?
---
While doing rifts from current events I can't see the white floor markers for the shards, I already looked at the options and can't see nothing that would cause that, is this a knows problem?
---
I run comfortably at 30 fps on medium. Of course I would not suggest zerging anything or doing world bosses. It ends up looking more like a power point.
---
There was no leak the company doing the watches clearly got it mixed up one why the fuck would they make GW2 watches to promote a new game. 2 why would Anet put this on the GW2 website as a blog before this "new game" is revealed.
---
&gt; wow
---
I've played both Classic WoW and EQ p1999. I can safely assume that Everquest is waaaaay more hardcore than classic WoW just from the death penalty alone. Not only could leveling to max in EQ take at minimum several months, but traveling to different locations around the world could take an upwards of several hours. And if you died? Not only did you lose a portion of your exp, but your corpse(and all your gear) was kept where you died. Not only that, but most players can solo in classic WoW, but classic Everquest required grouping for most players, barring some exceptional cases.
---
So yes, classic WoW was a casual game when it first released. It was designed as an EQ competitor, and some of the devs literally played EQ and casualified so much of the game's design.
---
Yeah, if they quit or dramatically reduced doing story, I would probably leave the game =/
---
=)
---
Well, it's killing every other game mode.
---
&gt;You do understand what gambling is, right? 
---
I understand what gambling is, and I'm aware that offering every item in lootboxes as a direct purchases would defeat the purpose of the lootboxes and render them not economically viable, and that is my whole point. 
---
&gt;Seriously, this is the dumbest attempt I have seen so far to hide your double standards in regards to gambling.
---
Could you quote where my double standards lie? Suggesting droprates should be disclosed along offering all of the randomized items as direct purchases are my suggestions against gambling for them in lootboxes. Where did I ever vouch in favour of having a lootbox-only economy? I specifically pointed out TCGs as an example of people creating a pretty big market in response to booster packs randomization.  This is also against gambling.
---
Heart of Thorns.
---
Path of Fire.
---
Screams of Terror?
---
It sorta works.
---
So I guess it's going to be up to what their internal statistics (not forum/reddit posts) say is the more profitable/higher population game mode, which is probably how they have decided to make decisions so far.
---
It should be "humans" if you know the lore.
---
Calling it a mod is disingenuous and that metaphor is really hard to track. I mean ffs you're comparing the enforcement of not compromising their game's security with the endangerment of a child's life.
---
It's more like... Uhh... Going for a round of paintball? You can bring your own equipment (within regulations, so no iced paintballs) but you are bound to a ruleset for fairness. The playing field is set for everyone and zones are established. 
---
Someone decides to bring a drone to record the match. Cool, right? You can watch the match as a spectator while you wait for your team's turn, you can watch the video afterwards or show it to friends, etc! Unfortunately, the drone is prohibited from entering the field by the owners. They're worried it could cause a hazard / instability in the field or worse it could be used for nefarious purposes such as scouting tool to share combat intel beyond the normal scope of the match.
---
The owners agree it would be a cool feature, but unfortunately don't have the means or ability to support it in time for the matches that day. They might consider it for the future, but at the moment they can easily see the potential for exploiting it and don't have a quick solution as an alternative.
---
Saw that in my email right after I read  your comment....copy pasta af
---
Sure... But in the long run, the living story model will kill this game. Living story does not being in New players and they're killing off every player population that doesn't find the living story to be enough. Fractals, raids, pvp, wvw, all of it is sidelined.
---
I'm aware, but asura have the most advanced tech, a culture around said tech, and lastly starts with a
---
Or maybe in Guild Wars 2 again, i understand all the point about how the game is lacking of content but it's not dead  
---
finger crossed for the 30th or the future of the game
---
Oh thank god. I saw the original post and cringed so hard.
---
Phone number : Yeah right lol .
---
honestly did realize the engine hasnt been updated kind of sad imo.
---
13 thousand hours played across all characters and the second I see "Guild Wars 2 Mobile" roll across my screen on the 30th, without the presentation of any other NEW content, that will be my uninstall moment.
---
Ugh. Right? Social media managers should at least pretend to be functionally literate.
---
And by definition hardcore casuals dont exist. Yet here we have casuals with 10k+ hours.
---
In most games being a casual player means limited game time and investment. In gw2 it often relates to a style of play regardless of playtime or investment.
---
it is imo it makes ecerything kind of feel the same though.
---
The fact that these eLiTe RaIdErS say the game is "dead" when they've gotten a major release less than three months ago, when other game modes have been given less for longer and are just "in decline", says a lot more about the raiders than the game.
---
We found one of the 68 accounts
---
it's a teapot with a handle
---
...but they weren't actively shitting on the community and Anet. Did you actually watch the event?
---
I must admit, for a moment I stopped to consider if they knew they're audience so well that they wrote it like that just not to confuse them.
---
The argument is something along the lines of: it's an MMO, a community game. Once players move on they rarely come back. Now if GW2 had more consistent and expected content releases this issue would be dampened, but take WvW for example: often when a commander or guild leaves they don't come back, and even if they do, they do so weaker than ever and drop many players. 
---
It's more that gw2 is such an old game it isn't replenishing new nor veteran players anymore. Just compare PvP or WvW populations from launch till now: people don't rebound back, they simply leave. PvE content released on cycles may bring some back but really just made the raid community more annoyed by how shallow the content was after such a long wait
---
This is the part that a lot of the fanboys never get. NCSoft was never the ones to blame for Anets layoff. Anet employees, and specifically the people in charge of this shitshow, sacrificed their coworkers. 
---
They sacrificed us too. Literally treat their community like garbage, for NOTHING. And still they continue to not learn.
---
I love this game. I want so badly for it to do well because its actually fun. I hate Anet because I have never seen a company so badly mismanaged
---
I don't buy for a second living story is bringing in a lot of players.
---
If most players came in because of those game modes you mentioned, they would be the most popular and most profitable game modes. People don't come in because of pvp and then show on internal stats as LS players.
---
Bullshit. Pvp and wvw were being neglected from 5 years ago - before the modern ls era. Neglected modes are not going to be popular. They have lower player counts than ever directly because the lack of support. It doesn't matter anyway. LS is going to kill this game, probably Anet, and I won't shed a tear. Fuck Anet.
---
You couldn't have waited until after the announcement? To see how you feel then? To use your analogy, you are at the bakery staring at the empty display stand but there is a sign that says "new cake coming soon", yet your still getting mad enough to make a Reddit post. 
---
Relax dude. Maybe play some Fire Emblem 3 Houses. It's a real good game.
---
Pugging is inconsistent and occasionally infuriating.  
---
[/u/lon-ami  Thanks.](https://imgur.com/a/LWpeAWC)
---
&gt;  However. If it was really such a big deal they could have made it so yes, the cameras could be used for this, with their blessing, but to keep it quiet.
---
How exactly do you envision this happening? Because it is very obviously not an in-game feature and do you expect the resounding question of "How did you guys get those cameras?" to be satisfied with a "can't tell you" or lie? Would they bring in NDAs to enforce the secret?
---
idk man. seems like mental gymnastics to justify support for a hack. and yes, it was innocuous in this event and the people using it seemed trustworthy enough, but it is still a hack.
---
It will be even worse than that. Anet will present Guild Wars 2 Mobile as the future of Guild Wars 2, with development of the PC version permanently cancelled because Anet don't give a shit about us, they only care about mobile gaming.
---
I mean, either their marketing push works and they (hopefully) keep it up, or if doesn't and the (hopefully) change strategies.
---
What evidence do you have that LS will kill the game? Or that only PvP and WvW bring in players? Why do you believe you know their market and revenue sources better than they do? Are you sure you're approaching this objectively?
---
He's literally already back streaming GW2.
---
His WoW adventure lasted all of 5 minutes and then he's in a 2 hour queue lol.
---
Cool if they made a watch like a Chrono logo.
---
Wrecks chronos
---
&gt;oh no, this looks bad
---
Creates watch to make up for it
---
&gt;all good here
---
Because gw2 back then was labeled as a game that has competitive scene (esports in pvp, mass scale wvw which even had a tournament), but gw2 today is labeled as a casual game.
---
Casuals dont succeed in competitive scene. They dont make the community healthier, they dont lead guilds, they dont organize events, they dont do anything significant. They just exist as a number in the party/squad/guild. Today it's one casual, tomorrow it's another, they dont play often, they dont communicate much, they dont invest time into anything.
---
You cant have anything competitive when a player who joins such content thinks that putting effort into learning means "working". That's why you need veterans or more dedicated players in such type of content. They basically create content for each other.
---
I wouldnt start raiding if I wasnt in a guild who had dedicated raiders. I wouldnt start raiding if I didnt get trained for raids. When I did start raiding, I wanted to get better at raiding. Once I got good at raiding, I wanted to teach others how to raid. Once raids went to shit, I never bothered with doing raids or helping anyone. Casuals remained in the guild, but they did nothing, because other veterans who were teaching the raids left long time before me. The guild suddenly fell apart. There could be 50 more new people coming, it wouldnt change a damn thing.
---
No veterans and no dedicated players = no group content. The only remaining thing are mindless open world zergs that spam 1 and have no idea what they are doing because they dont need to. Open world is simple enough for you to play other game while playing gw2 and not fail. 
---
If you ever played wvw and joined EB you'll see the same thing. No commanders = mindless zombies running around and hitting walls over and over again without actually achieving anything. Just because those people exist in wvw, doesnt mean that wvw population is healthy.
---
Not new
---
Ah you're right actually. My bad. GW2 actually has infinite content because the events just recycle every day. It's like a brand new quest -- every time! In fact, even harvesting nodes is fun content for me. I like logging in and collecting lumber, ores, and plants. Always keeps me satisfied.
---
Wing 8, press f to win
---
the difference being that gw2 is an mmo and warframe is sort of a hybrid mmo / shooter / other shit. while gw2 combat is good *for an mmo*, its still pretty shit (as is all mmo combat) whereas warframes combat is actually good, so they can afford to neglect the more hardcore parts of their game a bit. gw2 can't really afford to do that, as evidenced by the exodus of top guilds and streamers and the populations of pvp, wvw and endgame pve.
---
It's there since the beginning.
---
First off. Teapot said the day of the event asking people to lay off the point of Arenanet not officially supporting ERP3 and that he would release a video with his official statement covering it. So the argument that he waited a day to let things fester or get so bad is inaccurate.
---
Second, Arenanet let the JP incident sit for a day and no official statement all while devs abused the community on Twitter. Yet no mention of that.
---
If we’re going to start arguing the timing or how timely responses are we are going to have to start tearing into both Arenanet and the fanbase.
---
Which Teapot has adamantly stated he does not want.

Can we just stop going for one another’s throats please?
---
are you  seriously expecting a mediocre  developer making a new pc game when you can milk people with mobile games way easier with not even half of the development cost of a pc game and little no none risk since those people will eat everything from you of your hands?
---
Unpopular opinion: players dont play gw2, they play some other game(s). They want to come back to gw2, but there's nothing to come back to. It's just open world fiesta that you can do while playing that other game.
---
FFXIV never had good pvp, thats the difference.
---
yah the 2-5am NA times are pretty dead since most NA players would be sleeping. look into raiding guilds that are centred in Australia, your time may line up better that way
---
I wouldn't mind a Tama-Joko..

"No! Bad Joko! Quit pooping on the floor!!"

See but what people think is content is always different. I play the new story, get all the achievements, get the armor and weapons, while also playing PvP, whatever festival is going on, and a bit of WvW.
---
That's alot of content for me.
---
But there are people put there who rush the story in an hour, and don't care about the many other facets of GW2. The content is there, they just don't like it. To which then I got to ask.....how do you appease those people?
---
but Arenanet didnt know what was best for them, hence why they had to fire 200 something people last year.
---
Not moving the goalposts at all, my point is if a game starts off with a good variety of content then it will attract players who like to play that different content. FFXIV never had good pvp so it never attacted as many pvxers as other games. SWTOR and GW2 began with good pvp as well as pve.
---
The problem with Gw2 is the lack of communication.
---
Many successful games communicate with their community.
---
Gw2 does little to that regard, and we end up with so many problems we want the Devs to see, and Devs end up as people wearing earplugs and blindfolds unleashing wave after wave of "balance changes" to keep the game "fresh" without looking back and seeing wtf they did to screw things up or fix existing design issues.
---
They continue to keep pushing forward and drop little surprise packages of either hype or disappointment behind them, all without looking back.
---
Some people, if not most of the more seasoned players, are getting tired of this pattern. 
---
So they take a break.
---
2012 gamers tended to play multiple MMOs/SP games.
---
2019 gamers tend to binge and move on (# of people who ask what EvE and FF14 are in map chats anymore).....
---
Agree about Warframe. It certainly helps that the combat is quite slick, but I see way more stuff about the fashion.
---
However, it also has another advantage: a competent marketing team. Warframe has monthly content drops available via Nitro and other subscription platforms as a value add - I've never seen Anet once try to drum up interest that way, or by promoting their value-added goods outside of the game. The gemstore is not the worst implementation of a mtx store I've seen, but it's also not the best - there's potential there for it to be improved.

EA? xD

Nice to hear some better news. Actually it is the 15,6" (there is 14" as well) version and has the (mx150)[https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-IdeaPad-1xx-3xx-5xx-7xx/Lenovo-IdeaPad-530S-15IKB-Does-it-have-MX150-Max-Q-low-power/td-p/4406241] version with higher W.

Sadly as far as i am concerned this laptop can only take one ram, so there is no chance for dual chanel.
---
So the goal should be 720p lowest settings if i buy this machine?

I feel like killing time is a big part of how promos like this get started.
---
You say you play a bit of wvw. Wvw players also play a bit of pve they like.
---
So how come pve gets releases 2-3 times a year,  but wvw releases happen once in 3 years? You appease them as devs by simply showing them that you know they exist.
---
I'll be so happy when all this teapot business ends.  I don't know who that is and I don't care.
---
Because with spvp and wvw anet has neglected both modes for years, refuses to properly resource them and simply mismanages both and doesn't listen. Its not a case of burnout where players can go and come back. There is almost no hope that eirther mode will improve. I know they are still working on alliances for wvw but the player base has declined to such an extent that it is probably irretrievable.
