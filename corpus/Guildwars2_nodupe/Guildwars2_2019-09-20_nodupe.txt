It's Casual Wars 2 now buddy.

---
I don't think any HoT mobs or veterans are overtuned. If anything veterans die in a few seconds, the only "overtuned" stuff are the hero challenges, which are actually challenging alone.
---
Actually gonna pin this on the players. This might be the one and only time ANet actually listened to their fans. I mean, have you *been* to the Black Citadel?
---
Well, because you can only do that once people start getting them so they unhide.  By then we'll have seen it posted here.
---
Again, it depends on what you're trying to achieve. Just clear the fracs? Use w/e. I got my first Nightmare CM on power ranger with lb/gs, when we kited mama for 2 minutes after 25%.
---

---
The point of meta is not in _getting_ the kills, it's in doing fast and clean runs. You get the most of the damage multipliers, you get someone to heal, to break bars, to strip boons, to provide stab, aegis, q/a, 25 might, fury, so that dps guys can just close their eyes and burst the bosses into oblivion. The whole point of the specific party comp is to not miss out on stuff, which make you go faster + know what exactly you're supposed to be doing and what to expect from others.
---
I get that some people want to play the specific class because they enjoy it, but why would I want to take a guy who does 30% less damage than
---
Function gyro needs to be scrapped for a real profession mechanic.
---
&gt; That is an assumption, you may not care for skins but that doesnt mean others dont. Dragonfall didnt just have the skyscale, it also had the mist shard armor set and the blossoming mist shard armor set. For completionists there are minis and tonics to get too.
---
It's not an assumption to state that I'm a part of the majority of people who don't bother revisiting that map after playing through the story and getting the mount, because for that statement to be false would imply that the majority of players who did the LS chapter would have all achievements done and the armor set you keep talking about. That is quite obviously not the case, meaning what I said was fact.
---
&gt; I hope I didnt miss anything but honestly I dont see that as "significantly more content" at all! In the same timeframe we got...
---
You are basically comparing a watermelon with a pumpkin. The two games are nothing alike aside from the fact that they're MMORPGs. The difference between OSRS and GW2 is that OSRS is a sandbox game, whereas GW2 is a themepark one. GW2 has very little non-combat activities and one singular combat level. OSRS has 23 skills/disciplines to level up from 1-99. Leveling on that game is part of the endgame, and it is extremely time-intensive. The game is also not timegated like GW2 and other themepark games are. It just doesn't make sense to compare the two in the way that you're trying to.
---
&gt; playing gw2 story for start to finish in 2 weeks? come on. Thats not true even if you take away the 1-80 leveling that will take at least 2 weeks by itself or the masteries you need to complete HoT Storyline that still leaves 50 mission for core (308 if you want to do them all), 32 missions for season 2, 16 pretty large ones for HoT, 36 for season 3, 15 big ones for PoF, 31 for season 4. thats a total of 180 quests of we say put an average of 30 mins each thats 90 hours.. you'd need to play 6 hours every day to fit that in 2 weeks (and again that excludes leveling and timegates!)
---
6 hours a day is pretty normal to me when I'm heavily invested in something. Right now I play probably about 3-4 hours of FFXIV a night during the work week, definitely 6+ hours on weekends. I still don't see what the problem is with me having said I'd be able to plow through the story of GW2 in 2 weeks? I'd need to go balls to the wall sure, so if you want to assume I'd get bored and slack then make it 3 weeks or whatever. Either way, it takes months to get through FFXIV's story if you're a newcomer and that's if you're putting in the same amount of time and effort. The story quests on here have much more involved fights which you can actually fail on when you're bad at the game. I can't think of a single time in any other themepark MMO where I was forced to queue into dungeons/mini raid trials and learn boss mechanics for group gameplay. GW2 has not a shred of any difficulty unless you're going for the rewardless achievements. That's also part of the reason why it's so fast to go through the story.
---
&gt; being less accessible means more content?
---
The point is that GW2's raids have infantile-tier difficulty mechanics and it takes much less time to get through it than FFXIV's, coupled with the fact that there is vertical progression in FFXIV with gear whereas GW2 there isn't, it leaves opportunity for more meaningful rewards. You have more to work towards, because each raid will have different gear requirements than the previous. GW2 the best gear for dealing damage is pretty much always going to involve berserker's, assassin's, or more recently within the past few years viper's/whatever other condi stat prefixes. While yes, this was great when the game came out, it's stale and gives players less to work towards for future releases. You just need a set of ascended gear and you're good to go. I can take a break for years and have no catchup to play. While there are obviously some huge benefits to that, there is a huge downside to it as well-- if I am still playing, then once I get the gear I will never have to improve it again. That means I have less to do.
---
&gt; No you're not hiding anything, I guess we get living world releases that are completely devoid of content how. The trailers, all fake cgi! they dont depict real content.
---
I like how you're bitching at me for hyperbole when this little tidbit I quoted is the literal epitome of it.
---
&gt; Achievement is not content but its incentive to play content.
---
So you agree it is not content! Then *there you have it*. That's pretty much what I have been saying from the first post.
---
&gt; Now if I spend say 10 hours trying for the perfect run that gets me to shave off those last few seconds I need to get under the 2 minute mark how is that any different then you trying that raid a few times to learn the mechanics of it in order to beat it the first time? The raid itself maybe 1 hour long but if it takes you 100 triest you dont count it as 1 hour content do you? you count it as however hours it took you to beat it and how many other hours its going to take you to farm that content no?
---
It depends on why you're doing the race, and whether or not it's taking you long because you're just bad at it or because it truly is that hard. I can't imagine someone spending 10 hours on a stupid race in GW2 because you get *literally nothing* from any of them for putting that much time into them. Race achievements aren't a primary focus of a content release. GW2 releases content *purely* to cater to casual gamers. This means that anything that comes out will be easy and only require you to complete it, never to minmax a dozen hours. If you're doing something like that, then you're just arbitrarily setting yourself goals. That would be the equivalent of me farming hundreds of tries to get a *record clear* of a raid. To simply *clear* a raid is only akin to simply clearing the primary focus of whatever GW2 content you want to compare to. And in that regard, FFXIV raiding offers objectively more time and effort required to play through the content releases that GW2 does.
---
&gt; Same thing here! I dont know if its just that you dont see that for some reason or you're choosing to pruposely ignore it!
---
It is not the same thing as I just explained, and the answer to your rhetorical question is that I don't see that "for some reason" and that reason is because again, it is not the same thing.
---
&gt; Its undeniable that a single living world release has more content than a single raid and those skins makes all that repeatable for me like those bigger numbers make raids repeatable for you. yet here you are ignoring / hiding all that "there's simply nothing to hide"
---
First of all I don't even want to even talk about GW2's raids because they're so disgusting it makes me want to dry heave just thinking about them. Second of all, no that's completely wrong because raids are repeatable endgame content and living story releases are casual single-time playthroughs. Even if you value your skin collections as high as you clearly do, you can't collect the skins more than once. You unlock them once and then that's it. CAPICHE. Nothing more. Raids in FFXIV are designed to be done repeatedly, with rewards that are worthwhile even years later. XP, gil, gear for alts, etc etc.
---
&gt; tell me how did you poll the majority of veteran players? Are you sure you're not basing your opinion on posts on this subreddit that maybe involved 300 people sharing their opinion on this subject matter? How do you explain gw2 review has been stable for the last 3 years, do people buy stuff even when they have no content to play? Is it possible that perhaps you underestimate how much people share my view and how many share yours?
---
I like how you're referring to people buying stuff as veteran players, what the hell lmao? And what "review" are you even referring to? One of those shitty MMORPG websites with the journalism spacks that suck at gaming and cries about open world content being too hard or what? Anyways, people who buy expansions *still* in 2019 are quite obviously new players, not veterans. People who are whaling on microtransactions != veteran players either, those are just whales. Whales are whales.
---
I base that statement off of the fact that a) there is no hardcore community anymore, comparably to 2015. I was a pretty heavy influencer with a lot of twitch popularity for soloing and low manning dungeons and fotm years ago, and an officer/recruitment manager for a high-end PvE guild. I also wrote both the warrior and elementalist class guides on dulfy.net back when those were relevant, and I was an arenanet partner too. I think that means I am more than qualified to give an informed opinion of the fact that nowadays there is essentially no hardcore community anymore. The only relevant guild remaining is... LN? Any other ones are not that well known because there isn't anything to compete with anymore. SC and qT are pretty much dead. Everyone's given up and only logs in just because it's too hard to give up something you put so much time into, or has already moved on to other games.
---
&gt; that suggests open world content is 8x as popular as raids! yet you talk of "VAST MAJORITY"?
---
Okay hold on. Are you high or drunk? I genuinely need to ask that now, because in the same paragraph you already forgot that I said veteran players. *Veteran players*. **VETERAN PLAYERS**. How the fuck are you going to compare open world popularity overall in the game vs raid popularity, full-knowingly that GW2 is one of the most casual MMOs released in existence, and tell *me* that I'm wrong about veteran players agreeing that the game is in a poor and stale shape? 
---
Think about this shit for a second bub. You just told me that because casual gamers do open world living story content more than they do raids, it means that veteran players are happy with the game's current model. I can't make this shit up lmao.
---
The better scrappers I played against wouldn't \*die\* but they'd be forced to retreat periodically in 1v1's with me on prot holo. I could simply output more damage and tank just as many of their hits. On top of this, I had more CC and could push them out of the circle with relative ease.
---
i mean, why would you come to a post titled "world first record" and think to yourself "hmm...this is tryhard". It is in the name
---
 :( one day
---
I do agree to but I think it's important to keep an eye on the little fights.  One of the things that bugged me when the game first came out was that even after reaching a high level like 60+, going back to the starter zones was annoying because every trash mob was a longer fight.
---
Now you go back and you just 1 or 2 shot things but back then, even with full exotic lvl 80 gear, you still had to put effort into trash fights and I found it to be extremely tedious.  It also took away from the feeling of power you get from being high level and geared.  Overall I'm not against certain mobs being a good fight but not every single mob being a large endeavor.

Also, this is hilarious spelling of exacerbate

What holosmith setup has a one-shot/two-shot mechanic? While I agree with the rest of what you are saying I don't really know where you are coming from with the holosmith complaint here especially in wvw.
---
Sorry, I'm not a native speaker, but I think the term is spelled "masturbate".
---
Tried that and all the other tips floating about the net atm.  
---
Changed nothing for me, except reminding me why i use higher sound quality... 
---
I appreciate the effort though!
---
Now they just need to fix getting stuck to Pyrokatorrik's hand and being dragged down to hell with him when he dies. :P
---
Yep. 
---
I suspect its the CPU overload bug, that would also explain the weird LOD problems people are having
---
It's basically the hyper-nationalistic rhetoric and the use of fear of the other to demand unity.  This isn't just US politics though - it's also in Brazil, Israel, even some parts of Germany.
---
If on Windows, try reinstalling/updating your drivers on your graphics card. That sounds like you're describing screen tearing which is usually a graphics card issue. Also try changing your vsync options in the game itself and see if that could be what's causing it.
---
In WvW I prefer the new function gyro and think detection pulse is more useful than chem field so...........
---
Sure its a pity we're losing chem field but overall in WvW only I think scrapper is slightly better off, although  thats before the anti toxin rune nerf hits. With that nerf I doubt groups will run 1 scrapper per party like they do now.
---
Youre describing a Problem thats usually avoided by using VSync.   
---
Newer Monitors usually fight this problem themselves, but some still use computer-side calculation. 
---
The latest Win10 update apparently broke that.
---
Nope, not really.
---
I want a bustling PvE with tons of players and interesting events and not one of those "three hardcore people explore map by themselves, dying to random unfair mobs" things. I don't want to plan trip to the jungle, switching my armor and build to tankier stuff because mobs chain CC me and then kill from maxrange while _I_ can't attack them non-melee cause it auto-reflects everything. I don't want to waste my time on 10 minute smokescale-keeps-porting-around-killing-you mini-adventure with "one barb" as a reward after.
---
I don't want unsoloable HPs, cause that only gives me aggravation and not some mythical "sense of pride". I don't want to depend on many other players cause when people move on to better things it becomes so bad it's not worth it.
---
It's a casual game, keep it casual please.
---
Or worst case -- give a cm flag to users to make it harder _for them_ without taking stuff away from filthy casuals.
---
Thanks! I needed this!
---
I enjoy HoT when able to find a group. However I haven’t been able to find groups in those maps anymore. I stopped playing not long after HoT was released and it’s the only one I’m missing masteries for but soloing those maps kills me
---
That's not true.  Heads up! counted for me.
---
No, we imprisoned him at the end of wing 5
---
Look, they're fine until you want to do map completion and everything seems to only give 1% progress towards the completion.
---
Anyone else's WvW reward track get reset with this?
---
Not to be rude, but if you're doing LW you should have at *least* the Raptor, Springer and Skimmer unlocked. They're required for PoF story, even.
---
Yeah but I'm taking about having one guy do melee and the other guy do ranged... Like the end result will still be 10 Target on group 10 Target at range whether it was before the change (5 ranged and 5 melee for each scourge) or after (10 ranged on one and 10 melee on the other) .
---
Over all, split between the two scourges you have the same number of targets and need to coordinate between the two. That's not a buff to need more coordination to do the exact same thing.
---
Base game is free, seasons 2-4 have to be bought, expansion areas have to be bought. If you start logging in now you get S5 free.
---
&gt; I disagree that the model was dumb, but it was certainly not successful. 
---
I'd argue with that given the downturn in quarterly revenue since then, of course naturla attrition is also a cause.
---
There's some truth to what you say, but I disagree with the comparison to Dark Souls. DS has a certain fairness to it that few games seem to get right. I wouldn't say that GW2 really has that same aspect to it.
---
It wasn't successful because it wasn't sustainable. You'd end up with with very little new content for returning people except for what was currently going on.
---
Its will be easy to coordinate with the changes. In an organised group you designate some melee and some ranged. This is done now with some classes like Firebrand and rotating boons.
---
As much as I like to rag on some of the Bloodstone fights, I REALLY enjoyed some of the new mechanics they brought to the table when it came to gameplay. It helped me get a lot more aware of my surroundings as a player just basically by like, introducing a few Quick Time Events into play.
---
Path of Fire I've been noticing (I'm only like two thirds of the way through the story) hasn't added much to fighting gameplay itself through the masteries, just in the environment.
---
Hard should not mean calling for hours for one champ just to be told to leave the map.  It shouldn't mean trying desperately to get people to do an event for some obscure collection.  It shouldn't mean gathering people to do events to unlock some obscure minigame because you've ran out of MP options just to get immediately locked out for another hour.  It's artificially hard.  If we measure hardness by how annoying mobs are, both expansions are evenly matched.

---
Oh god, it's the Classic evangelism all over again.
---
*GW2 was always meant to be a game with a fairly low skill ceiling. It was always meant to be casual.*
---
Yes, there was meant to be harder content for people who wanted it, too, but from the very get-go it was advertised as a more casual, less grindy alternative to other games on the market. Don't be daft.
---
Try wow classic haha
---
I'm talking about the meta healer scrapper build, you need to take cleanse gyro for it, and it comes with the chemical field skill (poison field), so it's an added benefit of what you're already taking (since it is a toolbelt skill).  
---
It costs nothing to cast it too, because of short cast.  
---
And no, a rotation is a sequence of actions you do to optimize a result, you can't do that when playing against other players and you need to react to what's happening around you.
---
basement dwellers will complain either way. They wont stop complaining until everyone is forced to run with a 40man zerg to do story content. 
---
WoW has 4 difficulties for every raid, and the hardcore playerbase still complains that casuals can see the raids
---
&gt; No hardcore content in my game
---
I agree that the open world was the wrong place to have all that, but I don't think advocating for *no* difficult content in the game is healthy for it at all.
---
Nothing’s more annoying then when game devs just stick like, a Wolf with a cripple application that keeps you in combat right at every resource node....
---
Zero difficulty, 100% irritation/busy work/extra little un-fun hurdle.
---
If you ever want to know what meta js about to start, keep an eye on the timer boards scattered around the map. They highlight the meta that is currently going. Also keep an ear open, as there's an NPC that announces each event that's about to begin.
---
I was thinking of this recently too along with the hard invisible walls on jumping puzzles in old maps that really affect your mobility, and a saw a solution inspired by the Dolyak Race in the Festival of the Four Winds: place an NPC that "transforms" you and throttles your abilities and access to mounts down, in exchange for a new currency reward for map participation and as a requirement to be able to loot the chests from the jumping puzzles.
---
JP rewards could be made worth it again, invisible walls can be eliminated, and you would have much more of an incentive to go back to old maps that's completely optional, so it wouldn't be imposed on you so you wouldn't feel underpowered because you are having as much trouble defeating a random Skritt as you are the Forged.
---
If you think RNG is earning something, you just got cucked.
---
no, the system is fine, its the basement dwelling nolifers that see it as an issue. Ask any of the top mythic guilds like method if they care about LFR, normal and heroic to exist. They simply wont care about it cause it doesnt affect them. Its purely the "too bad to be hardcore, too elitist to be casual" dumbfucks that screams about it 24/7 on the forums and reddit
---
you want your ram to be used as much as possible...
---
Not really. I just don’t feel it’s worth the time/frustration when compared to the more casual gameplay in GW2. Rewards are hardly worth it and even when they are it’s more about the grind than the achievement of playing challenging content.
---
My new battle theme.
---
There is a rotation to press them in when you're dropping the whole bomb, and it should be done as soon as soon as you press f1 since f1 has a .5s cast time and each skill has a .5s delay. That way all the hits land at the same time. f5 breaks aegis for the least opportunity cost, then f2 can potentially strip stab, then f4 to potentially fear a newly stripped target. Thats how to get the best effect out of a shadebomb. f3 was always a press whenever during the rotation, with the new balance patch it should be used before f1 so that it applies barrier to 10 allies around you instead of just doing damage to 10 targets during the bomb. When pressed in that order, this patch becomes a 100% buff for scourge since it does everything important the old one did only to more targets at range.
---
The only question I have is whether or not all of these unique rewards from the Strike only come from the daily bonus chests? They're capped at three a day but you can still get boss loot after killing it again despite hitting the cap, so is it worth it to just farm the boss?

You’ve misunderstood what he said.

In raids, you can sell minis dropped in raids for raid currency, so you can get rid of your minis for something for money.

that one :)
---
Isn't it the same as in FF14 though, don't they run meta builds as well
---
That is what happens when you balance around role play, like the druid pet nerf.

It's not even about difficulty for me, I just want engaging  and rewarding gameplay and systems.
---
There's no build crafting in FF.
---
Open your own squad, advertise in lfg “everyone welcome, bring your own ~~build~~ and then get wrecked in the pre event.
---
It is 10 man content, be a team player, play  builds that are tailored to this specific content since that's how you should play, adjusting your to what is in front of you.
---
Whats there to sigh about? This change isn't going to affect the class negatively at all. Don't let all the idiots crying about this upcoming change affect your motives to play the game. Theyre just mad their niche build that they think is good is going away so they can't look unique anymore.

No....you don't.

That's definitely me bringing the agro to you because you'll just run off if I don't. Hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I do! :D

no, i don't like the gw2 story for other reasons, i think the writing is bad and too childish.
---
[Condi quickbrand](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition%20quickness/) is very much meta in raids and very usable in fractals. It is not a new idea. It’s just that power qbrand uses easier gear and has better burst and power buffs being more prevalent in fractals.
---
Also 10k dps is... not that great. But that means you can improve a lot! Follow the guides linked above and follow the raid build and rotations. Benchmark is at 28k, so you can almost triple your dps. Then, adds and teammates cranks that dps even further so you can reach insane dps.
---
Also make sure you’re actually maintaining boons, not just dps. Boons are the entire reason the build exists.

Someone who speaks as if he plays the game probably should know the same of the damn classes.

This may come as a surprise to you \[and many here\], but not everyone eats the shit companies like ArenaNet throw at them.

I was thinking the other day, it must suck to be a dev sometimes. You know some poor soul stayed late one night to make some rare item just so it'll be shipped on time, only to realize that no one will ever see your handiwork. It almost doesn't make the time worth it.
---
Even the most minor thing in PvE is worth anything that occurs in WvW.

Awesome tip thanks!

I agree. Like during wintersday evebt they could add some metal legion christmas themed songs would be amazing!

Assnet will always be trash.

There are certain mastery lines that are hidden. You have to earn all the ones you've started in each zone seperately. But if you don't raid and never started that mastery line, you'll get Heart of Thorns spirit shards even if you've never touched the raid mastery line.
---
Just remember each area of masteries, core, HoT and PoF are seperate, and have their own zones.

Well you didn't say that in the comment I replied to.

I agree with all of that. Seriously, well said, you put more work only that post then I do on a Tuesday.

To bounce off it, I have to say, "most people" don't know what's actually healthy for a videogame. I mean, I sure as hell don't either. But just look at what kind of lifestyle games are flourishing right now. Competitive player versus player first person shooters. Monster Hunter World. Destiny 2. All games, or even genres as a whole, that respect challenge, competitiveness, and players enough to give them the tools to play both casually and hardcore. There's a reason this subreddit blew up like it did after that announcement. It's because the underlying lack of challenge, combined with promise potential of challenge, and the disrespect towards that as a whole reached a tipping point. I really think it was just the straw that broke the camel's back. GW2 has a serious issue mantaining veteran players, and the longer it lives the worse it becomes. The more the veteran's drop out, the more new players come in, the more content is focused on casual players, the more players leave due to lack of challenge. It's a vicious cycle, a cycle that for most MMORPG's results in them just becoming P2W Nexon trash. We've all seen it happen a billion times. So ofc I miss the days that raids where coming out, HoT had interesting and non-brain dead PvE content, WvW wasn't dead yet (https://i.imgur.com/oCXSBFd.gif). And ofc it's ridiculous for the community to be so flip floppy about. Right after the presentation people were yelling from the rooftops that PvP, WvW, raids, etc, were abandoned. How about we have a moment of silence for their fallen brother, open world PvE, that got any hope left for it beat out with base-game mount availability. Sorry /rant. I just find this whole thing ridiculous. People will keep asking for the game to be easier till we're literally sitting in baby strollers. Which is normal, but then ArenaNet consistently listens to said people instead of treating the community like the children we are.
---
The latter.
---
Basically once you completed The Central Tyria mastery set, and if you do fractals on a daily basis, u would gain a lot of exp which in turn becomes Spirit Shards.
---
Same goes for the other two set and their associated meta events.
---
No. 100% do not. The level of difficulty just out against regular mobs in HoT was absurd. Frogs that 1shot most classes from stealth. Lizards that have a window of opportunity of 3 seconds and do 80% of your HP if you sit in the field for more than 2 seconds. POCKET RAPTORS.
---
I do not miss that. The entire map is essentially a large dungeon because you can do fuck all without a party; even going back as a very geared, reasonably skilled Mirage I struggle to hold my own against some of the creatures, and Mirage is notoriously good at soloing.
---
Condi firebrand (dps and quickness versions) are both very meta on almost all bosses except a very selected few (like at KC is not that good if the team is really good.)
---
not the best log but:
---
https://dps.report/GOBX-20190904-220144_mo

is an example of quickness version.
---
 Even at twins the normal version performs greatly:

Again i am not the best on it but this is not something super uncommon. People know about FB and do use it within the current meta to great success.

And that's the main thing with HoT.  The closest thing I felt to pride there was guiding someone to PoIs in TD because I know exactly where everything is.  But doing HPs, doing random things on the map...it was exciting when it was new, but only because it was new.  But when new wears off, the champs are chores, and there's only a sense of thank god that's over.  And it sorta spills forward from there.
---
Just weird people in need of inflating their egos. Both the guys and the girl. As a girl, I wouldn't let other guys I know abuse people like that. It would just make me lose respect for them. So ya, get away from them.
---
Question: Where is the Fractal Reliquary at?
---
It’s an achievement item that you get when you collect all the trophies that you can get from ascended salvaging
---
Players don't actually know what they want. Players clamour for easier content. ArenaNet for some reason listens and makes the game easier. People leave because the game is too easy. ArenaNet starts losing money. ArenaNet focuses content on where the profit is. ArenaNet makes more casual content. ArenaNet tries to make more difficult content for a healthier game. Players don't know what they want. Players clamour for easier content. Etc., etc.
---
It's a viscous cycle. Happens to MMO's all the time. And then people expect ArenaNet to stop making cosmetics for the cash shop and put them in the game instead. As if they'll make money magically.
---
Thanks for the advice... so it’s not just me right, what I described there was not very good situation right lol
---
Right...you'd think those people who buy every expensive infusion would want to show off to the world what it looks like...
---
I always enjoyed frequently finding another player at a far out of the way HP. Just two silent strangers that randomly met for one common goal in the middle of nowhere. The HP trains kind of ruin it
---
It's a queue. First in line, first out of line.
---
Oh I agree. They can't abandon these smaller playerbases. The raid, PvP, and WvW are required for the continued success of the game, even if the money isn't there. They are more vocal about the game, so keep them happy, and you get more people saying good things.
---
It's just complicated when the people who keep the game profitable are usually a different and larger group of players. It's a hard balance Anet needs to focus on, and I'm not trying to say they are doing either a good or bad job at it, just that it's not as simple as focus on either hard or casual content exclusively.
---
No reason? That's their main mechanic, they enter a stance that gives them projectile avoidance, forcing you to switch your tactics. One of your masteries even reveals them when they stealth.
---
I suppose some people can't bear it when the game offers some manner of resistance that makes them actually think about how they should approach a fight.
---
Or you kill everything before you get damage and use your dodge button
---
Uh...the hot metas are also autopilot.  You park at matriarch and cc sometimes.  You park at your lane in TD and cc sometimes when you damn well shouldn't.  You park at the octovine and ignore the other lanes.
---
And yes, I do them for the gemstones.  Then I can use the more profitable activities which I can do one day a week only to not pay for something so easy to farm.  It's a waste of gold to buy the gems.
---
Because he was an incredibly cheesy boss with chain CC and debuff spam.
---
That's the issue with GW2 combat, it's so shallow due to the 2 dodges and boons giving you so much capacity to negate mechanics, that mobs are given artificial difficulty in terms of autoattack damage and pinball CC mechanisms to overcome how much you can ignore.
---
Right. So what would be this hypothetical situation where you're gathering berries, get interrupted by an enemy, and deal with said enemy, without it being annoying?
---
have you played the core tyria beetle races?
---
There are various dialogue changes based pn being charr and what your legion is. A lot of which being in the style of either "they're your people" or "you've been gone so long they don't see you as one of them and need to be reminded you are" depending on the speaker.
---
#JACARANDA
---
I still dont get how you dodge the attack where he hits his fist on the ground...
---
The first part is actually false, atleast when it comes to the skyscale. I maxed out my masteries and was able to get shards before even discovering the skyscale, which honestly makes more sense in my opinion.
---
6th tier mastery needed to deal with the basic mechanic Chak have is an almost clownish design choice tbh.
---
i mean for mob kills... you know like a regular map..
---
Oh so ur just shiny and yellow?
---
Yes you should make sure you strip aegis/boons before using the fear but you should also use f3 during the bomb as well as the situation calls for it or else no you aren't getting the best effect out of a shade bomb. Use your brain and don't waste the f3 applying barrier when it would be better used for more damage instead and vice versa.
---
Hallowed Ground is much better for fighting on nodes in sPvP. It’s much more easily traitable, pulses the boons, and it’s a fire field.
---
You can get plenty of stuff by doing instanced content, and avoid berry farming completely. It's not 2017 anymore, when it was an overpowered farm.
---
Of course they're annoying, that's the point. Enemies are annoying. Would you rather they did more damage? If I remember correctly they did, and that was nerfed because people complained. Could be wrong idr. I'm all for them to do more damage and being more dangerous lol.
---
The difference between killing an enemy and watching a bar fill for 20s...I mean, seriously? One is engaging with the combat, the other is staring at a bar.
---
So just chip damage? I mean, if you want to compromise and have them do legitimate deadly damage, but much less chill, that sounds perfectly reasonable to me.
---
found out which of your skills block or evade the enemy's attacks, and then find out which of the enemy's animations you need to look out for and avoid. the more you get used to this thought process, the easier bosses will be in the future. you might want to consider bringing feedback for this fight because it reflects projectiles and that's all the grubs use. the big guy has pretty slow attacks you should just be able to back away from. also consider kiting him (leading him around) in a circle within the group of grubs so his attacks miss you while he's still in range of their death explosions. sometimes moving like this will also make projectiles miss, which is another thing to consider getting used to (find something to shoot at you and then move side to side and watch how bullets miss you)
---
dang i wanna see this on like, an autumnal sylvari or just any sylvari with a yellow glow. or paired with the new pyromancer gloves
---
I'm not against stun or conditions. Just the amount of stun and condi applications in proportion to condi cleanse and stun break is too much in open world pve.
---
Well yeah, that's the problem, that 90% of the game is laughably easy while the rest is still easy at worst
---
The point is though that if an enemy poses zero challenge, how much more engaging is it really then watching a bar fill?  Like really...  
---
I know anet can’t make it super hard, because it’s how most casual or undergeared people get their gear, but like, they also don’t have to use just sheer annoyance tactics.  
---
As for it being nerfed, I dunno...  I haven’t actually berry farmed in years, but if it has and it’s even LESS dangerous than I remember, then just wow...
---
Hallowed Ground isn’t same thing as Stand Your Ground, And is much better in any 5-target scenario. 
---
If they buffed Hallowed Ground to be 10 targets, then it could devalue Stand Your Ground. Hallowed Ground pulses it’s boons is way more easily traited, and it’s a fire field. It already has its niche over Stand Your Ground.
---
No, they don't.
---
Oooooh, the small maze. I agree that one was cool, I wish there were multiple variants of it
---
Maybe nightfury should be infusion to.
---
It also keep me out of a good chuck of the content. The game goes from "do whatever you want, play your character however you like, use whatever skills/weapons/builds you enjoy most" to "actually, forget all of that, you must play with exactly * this current strongest meta build * executing your skill rotation time and time again with minor situation-dependent variation, in the name of efficiency"
---
In my opinion, you aren't asking for players, you want bots that repeat the same operation flawlessly ad infinitum
---
The harcore players don't mind because they care about winning/completing objectives in the shortest possible time with the lowest fail rate above everything else.  The more linear and streamlined team composition builds become, the better
---
For the developers, it's far easier to create challenging content with less variables, they just need to design and adjust to the meta. Games like World of Warcraft have done this for a very long time by now
---
I get the feeling that the largest part of the playerbase  mostly spends their time running around in open world and participate in world events with little pressure (if also with challenge) and no one breathing down their neck about not playing right/not being good enough/braindead and so on
---
I mean, they certainly aren't in PvP or WvWvW, now, are they?
---
Arenanet would know, anyway, by looking at their data. They could probably make Strike missions a lot tougher if they thought that's what most the player wanted
---
At the end of LS4 Rox has said that she's not going further with us. She's staying with Olmakhan. It was only logical that she wasn't be in Grothmar Valley.
---
There's nothing like HoT maps on release. There are things that have somewhat comparable difficulty, but the experience is utterly different.
---
I do understand that HoT release botched a lot of things, but when looking at those maps in a vacuum, they were amazing. The problems arose in almost everything else, story, paying full price for what is essentially a twice as difficult game, etc. 
---
But, HoT was a completely unique gaming experience. Now ofc, it got nerfed twice and we skip everything with mounts, so...whatever I guess.
---
well yes, Kasmeer didnt say anything about her clothes since season 1 , so we cant be sure if they are real or still an illusion
---
It’s added on top of what it already does + it’s now a blast.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Thank you!
---
So you can use the winter‘s presence only on one character?
---
Even if easy and simple, some engagement is better then none. No wolves just becomes a press f simulator. Which is even less engagement. 
---
As for the nerfs, it's 1 am, so tbh don't take my word for it, it was just a gut feeling.
---
Isn’t this what they already do?
---
Bristlebacks are cute, but good god the adult ones are dicks
---
This would look *so good* on my Sylvari that I've styled to look like smoldering, burnt wood.
---
Some Tonics still allow you to fight, and if I've heard correctly this one is one of them. Even if it isn't, it's still a fun novelty.
---
I or yknow, just release all three versions for all three weight classes
---
It's not like there's not a bunch of light and medium armors that look like heavy anyway
---
Nice aegis. XD
---
Yes, the game is still active, though more so in PvE. GW2 progression is very horizontal with only minor min/maxing and some late game stretch goals. If you wanted, you could be ready to do just about any content for ~30g and some time.  You can see a [great gearing guide here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) for getting set up. If you just wanted to be ready for open world and story content you can skip out on best in slot runes and sigils and use cheaper options too. I'd suggest looking up[ a build](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) and just gearing towards it.
---
What sword is that?
---
yess yess i told its 14000 when im alone offcourse i can go for 22000 pretty easily if we have a complete team anbd yeah i do boon at 100% uptime if alacren help me with ala and i know abouth all of this xd its not the raid golem its the frac one so no buff and all jsut raw solo dps by myself
---
Ah yes, the OG Deadeyes, with the ~~Death's Judgment~~ Charged Shot from stealth. So skill. Very counterplay. Wow.
---
You're not reading it correctly. If a mastery is hidden, it doesn't count. As soon as you unlock it, it does count. What I've said is you have to earn all the ones you've started, which means hidden ones only count after you start them.
---
Yeah? I'm not a "HUGE WP fan", matter of fact his format is good but he's one of the most annoying streamers ever - but allow me to get back on track with you. 
---
Please educate me:
---
 • How can I get underpaid if practicality no one at present buys shards off of the player base?? Getting gold for a material that isn't meant, by design, to be sold is a scam? SEEMS LEGIT!
---
• Diminishing returns - Anet's way of thwarting any hardcore grinders. So you "farmed" these materials then? Give me a rough estimate how much units did you farm?? 20? 50? How long did you "farm"?? An hour a day? Or maybe a day each week?? 
---
The fastest GW1 farm - the Broodmother cave just outside Rata Sum - I and probably everyone else farmed those raptors. Day in - day out. Especially during major festivals. Getting several stacks of *the item you crave* after putting in 8-10 hours of your day, each day, doing a run that took approximately 2 mins - that's farming. 
---
GW2 has never had such grinds, that's what they meant by "can't be farmed".
---
Good luck with getting half a stack of T5/T6 mats just from mob drops.. 
---
• Before I wrap this up, tell me who has more credibility - you, a random nobody, no proven track record of anything achieved on a community wide scale, or MM who sponsors streamer's prize pools, website contests and who on multiple occasions has gifted away 2, sometimes 3 legendary weps to people that just had to ask him (or dare him that he wouldn't)??
---
***SPOILERS***
---
You haven't got the vaguest idea what you're talking about and I'd laugh at you if you weren't such a sad, misguided case ..
---
Pardon me while I go get "ripped off"...
---
So i can only use winter's presence on one character? Thanks for your suggestion but hell naw.
---
makes sense then.
---
Wait huh, it's not permanent? I haven't been able to play the new story yet, did I miss an event that only happened in the opening days?
---
how it could be more powerfull because the damage of condi is higher like 1/4 more then ower in a long fight because condi quickbrand lost a little compare to the condi dps so like 1000 dps compâre to power who lose like 3/4000 compare to compare to dh and condi can follow dh pretty nicely
---
Ah, my apologies. I understand it now.
---
It has been my experience as a female playing female characters, particularly those in the light classes, that female armour often has entirely too little coverage rather than too much. Or extra. I devoutly wish that my characters could look savvy, adventurous and a little tough without looking like they are also a woman of negotiable affection fresh from the nearest whorehouse.
---
I strongly suspect that the over sexualization of females in gaming, GW2 included, owes a great deal to the men who play as female characters and like to look at their own boobies. Pity it sucks so much for all us girls.
---
I think a lot of people probably have complaints of this nature, and I also think we all have about 0 chance of having any of them addressed.
---
You should post this to /r/SteamPosters
---
Haunted Armor Outfit
---
saving and upping so that I can that when I get home
---
Another Slap in the face for the beautiful city of the Black Citadel &gt;\_&gt;  
---
They totally could sing above the Foundry...
---
Also the wvw armor tentacles effect into an infusion.
---
&gt;Game studios do virtually zero unit / integration testing my dude, it's all manual play testing.
---
No, it isn't.  We do a great deal of integration testing because manual playtesting catches very little, and is even more time costly than proper testing before it gets that far.  If you're not integration testing, you're doing it wrong.  Any game more complex than Candy Crush can't be effectively playtested without hundreds of testers, and even then, what few bugs playtesting finds is more likely going to be discovered in the public test phase when you have thousand to tens of thousands of testers, far beyond what any game company can afford to employ.  You think playtesting finds lots of bugs, because your're only seeing the tip of the iceburg above the waterline that hides the majority of issues fixed before it ever reaches the public test phase.
---
Source: A decade working in the gaming industry, almost as much as a corporate software developer before that, and seeing where the VAST majority of our bugs are reported from.
---
&gt;codebase of ~400k lines
---
that's adorable.  Add one or two zeroes to that and get back to me.  Even the more basic mobile games will have more code than that.  
---
Additionally, "managing" code has a completely different skill requirement to making the code in the first place, and shows to explain your overly strong focus on maintenance complexity vs development complexity.  The sad fact is, in this industry, companies will hire ten times as many coders to create the game than they can employ once it's out and lay most of them off as soon as the game is launched.  Only the larger studios can afford to have several projects ongoing at the same time and be able so shuffle developers from one to another to maintain demand for labor.  This means that shaving a bit of complexity off of development, even if it adds complexity to maintenance, can save a huge amount of money. Being able to launch a week earlier means you can lay off those employees a month or two earlier and save potentially hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.  Even if this comes at the cost of harder to maintain code later on, it's cheaper to employ 50 people post-launch than 300 people pre-launch.
---
I fucking sucks, but it's true... faster development saves more money than faster maintenance.
---
The non vendor version you get as random drop, and the only difference is that you can trade it
---
I got 100% map completion in a day, and only have the raptor unlocked. I borrowed the skyscale from the vendor on the eastern side of the map to get to the jumping puzzle and hit a few of the vistas that I couldn't see any other way of gettting to.
---
No worries, mate, I probably could have been clearer.
---
I play female characters because of the more detailed and often more 'fitting' armor. Especially with medium armor male characters often look like wearing a potato sack. And I have the same problem with too much skin. I personally like my character suited for fights, cold or a fearsome jungle not for a warm bath or some freetime at the beach..... Over sexualisation sells, unfortunately...
---
on a brighter note than what?
---
Cool, too bad it will be too stupidly expensive to ever get
---
The Spacey one felt a lot like a race, even if it is wasnt exactly that.
---
Do it yourself?
---
You won't find anything really close to the game in the anime unless you focus on one aspect of it. The action combat and skill portion is probably not suited to MMOs, closest would probably be BnS over GW2. But then GW2 has better group PvP.
---
And why wouldn't they be? They're ontop of the goldpile. Although you say they're being transparent i highly doubt rhey're fully transparent. Wouldn't make sense for them to add competition/make people have enough money so they wont deal with them (basicly trying to get as rich as them)
---
See? You managed an entire post without having to call someone names. You *can* do it. You just don't want to.
---
Next drop the righteous fury of your holy war against the infidels and wrongthinkers and you may become someone to actually have a conversation with instead of just another raging, self-absorbed keyboard warrior jerking his dopamine kick by belittling others.
---
I ask for help from some experienced guys, sorry for that mate :-(
---
I think... in that case it should have been titled: "On a darker note..." &gt;\_&gt;  
---
Would have made more senses. xD
---
It's permanent, people just like the concept and want it to expand beyond just the one map it's currently in.
---
What's this !
---
Thank you so much for the PSA!! Been waiting for this &lt;3
---
Well for one thing, they did mention that the world boss in the upcoming map will be comparable to Triple trouble, difficulty wise
---
I can't answer the first question but the 2nd question can be answered if you read the Acquisition section that you conveniently linked yourself... 
---
Randomly dropped by:
---
* Vault of the Khan-Ur chest
---
* Shiverpeaks Pass Strike Mission bouncy chest
---
* Completing events which contribute towards meta events in Grothmar Valley
---
Is this a cover or is it just the music from the game without the voices?  If it's the latter, good job.
---
Griffon and Skyscale are two halves of one complete flying mount. You should have both.
---
Skyscale climbs terrain effortlessly, so that you can dive from height to fly quickly with Griffon.
---
Griffon flies quickly to reach faraway places that can be explored and traversed with Skyscale.
---
They compliment each other, one is not a replacement for the other, and neither one makes the other redundant.
---
That wouldnt appease people. Given that our first one doesnt have a CM, people would just yell about empty promises instead
---
Not at all, going back trying to do hero challenges on characters I haven’t maxed out specializations for is incredibly frustrating. I get that they are supposed to be group events, but it’s pretty tough to find groups doing them nowadays which means I have to wait around until someone comes along, and even then we may still die! 
---
On a side note, how the hell am I supposed to get the bladed chest piece when like 7 people are doing the Verdant Brink meta, it’s literally the only way to get the piece but even if we all have 200% participation it ain’t possible. I’ve tried at least 6 times in the past month with no success.
---
Take off your other infusions...and put on armor.
---
how does it look on charr? i must know
---
Why dont people wait lol. No one knows rough drop rate properly yet, it could go down to a few thousand.
---
Yeah I gotta agree with everything you said!
---
(Although I don't have a fantasy of walking around like a glowy christmas tree ornament in real life xD)
---
They also used moving platforms and action camera again for the shooting range, which was really nice.
---
Can you show us like Dulfy does? (not salty just confused at other stuff on your char) e.g; remove all weps + gear and just have the infusion on by itself?
---
This may be first infusion that I'd love to have.
---
I loved HoT maps, I like exploring the dangerous jungle.  It felt like there were stakes.  It made me a better player.
---
But... it's not new that statuette stuff is changing with new Black Lion Chests. o.o
---
The point for that is simply to not overfill the statuette vendor. There are 5 tabs and 2 of them change with new BL chests. Without changing we would end up with either dozens of tabs or one big confusing mess.
---
You know, I wish they'd remove LFR and only keep Mythic difficulty. See how that works out for the game. Because Wildstar wasn't a clear enough message. Heh.
---
&gt;It's not an assumption to state that I'm a part of the majority of people who don't bother revisiting that map after playing through the story and getting the mount, because for that statement to be false would imply that the majority of players who did the LS chapter would have all achievements done and the armor set you keep talking about. That is quite obviously not the case, meaning what I said was fact.
---
Not really, people who are achievement hunting would finish all the achievements, there is more then 1 reason to play in old maps, doing dailies, gathering the map's currency, or even simply for the fun of it. That being said even if we go by your premise, if you check the numbers I think you'll find you're wrong. I went for episode 1 of each season and checked on gw2efficiency number of people who finished the story, those who completed an achievement related to open world that does not reward a mastery point and the number of people who compeleted all achievements. 
---
For Gates of Magumma 140k, doesnt have any open world achievements, 47k
---
Out of the shadows -&gt; 130k, 96k, 56k
---
Day Break -&gt; 114k, 82k, 25k
---
This means on average around 33% of all the players completed all achievements while 73% completed an achievement while playing in the open world. 
---
And the cherry on the cake is the requiem armor we've been talking about. If we go by perception hardly anyone has it. I mean I've seen maybe 3 characters wearing it? luckly it has achievements tied to it so lets see how many people actually got it. So 85k actually finished the story of those 39k finished getting the elegy armor of those 22k finished the first set of achievements for the upgraded requiem armor set and 15.6k finished it. about 50% got elegy and 25% started working on requiem... fewer finished it but well its entirely possible the difference are still working on it. In any event all these numbers and percentages are much higher then what you find in raids so yeah while sample size is small and none of these numbers are conclusive I'd say open world is more popular.
---
&gt;You are basically comparing a watermelon with a pumpkin.
---
you do you realize you did that first right? You claimed runescape releases "significantly more content"! Also I have to point out you're using two different measures... so replayability in sandbox is content (and I agree)  but in a themepark its not, act like it doesnt exist? Is that fair?
---
&gt;I still don't see what the problem is with me having said I'd be able to plow through the story of GW2 in 2 weeks?
---
My problem is miss information, someone sees that and thinks gw2 has hardly any story. 2 weeks and thats it. No new player is going to get through it all in 2 weeks, not even 2 months (well if they're hardcore lets get to the finish quickly they might in 2 months, but they'd be missing out a lot). 
---
&gt; Either way, it takes months to get through FFXIV's story if you're a newcomer and that's if you're putting in the same amount of time and effort.
---
It also has a lot of busy work, at least it does at lower levels, things like walking to different zones to deliver a message and then going back! essentially a 2 minute quest with like 30 minutes of traveling (invented the numbers but I am sure its not that much off the mark) Cant just the rest, I barely scratch the surface but first impression was a lot of busy work.
---
&gt;it's stale and gives players less to work towards for future releases.
---
no it isnt and no it doesnt. The problem here is you're applying vertical progression mentality to a horizontal progression game. In a horizontal progression game its not about getting "stronger" its about versatility. Its about the masteries that give multiple playstyle to the same profession and those different playstyle require different gearsets. Its about the new stat combinations that get released from time to time and how you can leverage those for a better build etc.. Its a different philosophy but it certainly doesnt mean nothing ever changes. 
---
&gt; living story releases are casual single-time playthroughs
---
totally your opinion, I dont threat them as a singletime playthrough and neither do the people i come across or the 75% who actually got achievements related to the open world.
---
&gt;you can't collect the skins more than once.
---
And how many times do you farm your gear set in FFXIV raids exactly? 
---
&gt;Raids in FFXIV are designed to be done repeatedly, with rewards that are worthwhile even years later. XP, gil, gear for alts, etc etc.
---
Exactly which of that doesnt apply to living world releases? Well we dont get gils we get silver but apart from that playing in the living world releases gets you xp, gets you money and you can most defintiely using the map currency to buy gear for alts. 
---
&gt;and what "review" are you even referring to?
---
sorry momentary lapsus, meant Revenue, hands typed review
---
&gt;People who are whaling on microtransactions != veteran players either, those are just whales. Whales are whales.
---
Whats your evidence that all of the gemstore revenue comes from whales who pay $1000s a month rather then a lot of people paying $10-$30 a month? I've seen this repeated ohh so many times but every time I ask what exactly these whales are spending all this money on its always raid silence. Maybe you have the answer? Cause the only item thats possible to spend that money on is the black lion chest but most if not all of its content is tradeable. So if a new weapon set hits whales dont have to spend $1000s to get that if they're unlucky (funny how skins become so desirable when they're behind money and how no one is interested in them when they're open world rewards) A whole new weapon set in the blc can be bought for maybe $30 if you convert that to gems -&gt; gold and buy off auction house. So really were is all this money going to?
---
&gt;Okay hold on. Are you high or drunk?
---
not that its relevant but neither.
---
&gt;VETERAN PLAYERS. How the f@@@ are you going to compare open world popularity overall in the game vs raid popularity, full-knowingly that GW2 is one of the most casual MMOs released in existence, and tell me that I'm wrong about veteran players agreeing that the game is in a poor and stale shape?
---
what? by any chance do you think that you casual players dont stick with a game long enough to be considered veteran? Like take me for example long long ago I tried this game called guild wars and I was impressed by its feats of immersion. For once NPCs were not static statues who day and night would stand there even in the face of imminent attack that just never really came. More then that here was a game that gave me all the choices. Being a necromancer didnt mean I could help an injured friend or disrupt an incoming army. Then Gw2 was announced. It promised to have all I loved and more. For the most part for me it delivered, yeah it was a bit too easy true but man its world was alive and did it take immersion to the next level.  Anyhow enough reminiscing, so what I am not a veteran than because raids are something I enjoy doing on the side rather than the main content I seek? 
---
No I am a veteran player and I am pretty sure I am not the only one. Well I know I am not the only one, plenty of people in my guild coming from gw1 too.  My point isnt that veteran players need to be happy because casuals are happy, that would be an absurd point to make. My point is in a game that as you say "GW2 is one of the most casual MMOs released in existence" chances are a good chuck of its veterans play it because they enjoy that!
---
A variety of strings suggesting additional modes for strikes including CMs, time trial and no deaths have been datamined. Check that_shaman's Twitter.
---
Yeah I almost forgot about that one because adventures were only a one time silver/gold for me, then forget.
---
And here I'm just doing it every time it pops out
---
Everything you need is in a video, what's your point?
---
Also one in the pvp reward track along with Banner skins and the band shirt, however I don't believe it is repeatable.
---
GW1 Pre-Searing vibes
---
You had an [Item Booster](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Item_Booster) active, that grant's you 33% for an extra strike.
---
Really nice!
---
artifical scarcity
---
I don't think you can take one example and generalize it to everything
---
Ha, oh my. Well it's always hard to notice your own stupidity :D Thanks for the clarification.
---
In most of the content Guild Wars 2 provides you don't have to know much about the game to be successful. In most open world events like World Boss or meta events it simply is enough to just auto attack the enemies and they will die.
---
In more difficult and organized content like Fractals or Raids this looks differently because you need some experience and skill to activate and cancel certain things (like aftercast) to optimize your DPS and small hiccups could lead to not finishing that phase as fast as you want it to. This might not be of interest for many players but if you want to complete the content faster or are specifically looking at speed runs this will get more and more important.
---
The same goes for PvP and WvW. You need quite some experience not only with your profession of what it can and cannot do but you also need to know about other professions as well so that you don't engage other players that are the counter of you. Then you also need to know when and how to use your skills because it wouldn't matter much if you spam all of your skills but not hitting anything in the slightest because they sidestep your AoEs or they are currently blocking or invulnerable.
---
The skill to play GW2 in a more competitive context is to know a lot of the game and when to you use which combination and anticipate certain situations and react to them quickly.
---
that was just one example. Go through the armor gallery on female vs male. Male is usually the same but with features removed
---
i think tera, bns and bdo are the only mmorpgs where you can activate skills with combo imput instead of hotkey for each ability
---
Very much active, although PvP and WvW are apparently less busy than they used to be. I still get PvP matchups off-peak, so I don't think it's too bad really but I gather the top end has lost a few key players. 
---
It's a *very* low grind game as top-tier gear is entirely achievable by the time you get to that stage and second-best gear is generally seen as a valid alternative. In D&amp;D terms, it's more 5e than 3.5e, if that's a reference you understand. 
---
All content is accessible, except for very early game stuff and there isn't any content that nobody plays - even "dead" dungeons are very active and you shouldn't have to wait more than a couple of minutes to get a team together. Fractals (dungeons 2.0) and raids are busy, although raids have a barrier to entry if you're not part of a guild. 
---
The core game is free and if you enjoy that you'll enjoy the expansions even more as it's basically the same thing but the zones are better and the elite specs etc are generally seen as improvements. It's not pay-to-win *at all*, unless you count buying the expansions (and to a lesser extent, the Living Story mini-expansions, although you can technically unlock them for free but it's a hell of a grind to do that).
---
for me the script is not pulling data what could i be doing wrong?
---
ggg gets nothing done
---
they can only produce content every 3 month cause 3 reasons
---
1. dont care about optimization
---
2. dont care about testing
---
3. reuse content
---
every league is either a map or crafting in disguise. There was not a single new feature aside from MAAAAYBE the up/downranking during betryal. 
---
Their game looks like shit, thier game runs like shit, they lock "efficent" trading behind paywall or giving your account info into a unofficial 3rd party tool. They get constnat bugreports and still implement the league stuff into core before fixing it. And yet they dare to charge 40 bucks for a armor set. GGG is a trashcan studio carried by blind fanboys.
---
God I wish dwarves were a playable race. You know, the few that didn't turn to stone. Or I guess even some of the ones that did, somehow. Would be cool for customization. 
---
They already have some dwarf models from All or Nothing, and as they're just squished Norn the armor problem wouldn't really be there. Story and VA work would still be an issue though I guess.
---
I know this is super fake, but I wouldn't be surprised if Braham dies this season and Jhavi Jorasdottir replaces him. I wouldn't be surprised if Bangar dies and Rytlock replaces him as the new Emperator.
---
They send the mail to the toon with the highest playtime
---
I understand that, but that toon no longer exists...Or was it not deleted from their data base?
---
&gt; I can understand putting items on the gem store to trigger impulse buys but there is really no reason to do the same with Black Lion Statuette's.
---
its the exact same reason, ppl will impuls buy black lion keys (for the chest---&gt;statuettes) when they see something they can get with the statuettes they want.
---
There is also at least one achievement that you can get specifically as a (Blood Legion?) Charr (Meet Your Imperator).
---
Do I scour the patch notes, no. Do I glance at them and look at what is effecting my professions, yes. Not everyone looks at the patch notes with a fine tooth comb.
---
Winter's heart does not only affect the skin. It's more akin to the Toy shell infusion or Celestial infusion.
---
That's good to know. I will hold onto them and see what happens.
---
Eh, another "cover my skin and eyes up" ones. Would love to preview it because you never know but lol.
---
Purity of body is the 25% endurance regen Minor trait. Do you mean Force of Will? Could work yeah, though if they change it to give 300 concentration they may need to redesign the Staff trait too, otherwise we would have potentially 540 concentration (36% boon duration) from Honor alone.
---
I mean Selfless Daring makes sense within the context of other Minor traits, which boost endurance regen. Not to mention it would still be a bad trait when put as a Major trait. As for putting Pure of Heart, arguably one of the best traits we have for support, in Minor and allowing each application of Aegis to heal without it blocking something would be OP IMO. It would also make the trait a bit too spammy as you are no longer rewarded for actually using active defense to mitigate an attack but for merely pressing a button. 
---
Yeah +base duration% sounds like a good idea for Pure of Voice. Alternatively, they could revert the change on Stand Your Ground and make it 5 stacks of Stability on 5 man, and change Pure of Voice so it allows all shouts to affect 10 man. Not sure though.
---
I can't say that I have ever thought about buying BL chests just to get the statuettes but I can see the logic would apply to some people.
---
If you interested in something black lion related maybe you should from now on ^^
---
Ayy, that's how I did it too -- couldn't help waiting a few hours for people to figure out the proper way to get in on day one.
---
&gt;2. For the love of god, I don't want to play a "meta" build.
---
I'm always a bit baffled by this one: what is it with people not wanting to play a build as soon as it is labelled "meta". Those builds are just build that some people have worked on and that fulfill a role very well and can have great synergies with others.
---
The context matters a lot too: in open-world it's interesting that you generate some boons on your own and that you get some survival (like a breakstun) because you can end being on your own. In raids since you know you're gonna have 10 people you can start making sure that boons are covered by specific people so that others can go full on damage. To give a quick example based on Mirage: Maybe you will want to use stuff that increase your Vigor and endurance regen when you are on your own because it is very powerful to use the Ambush skills on Mirage by taking Chaos for the Vigor on F2 Grandmaster trait for example (Chaos also give some additional survival too), however in a raid situation your vigor should provided to you (by a Druid Sun Spirit + Chrono for example) so you can drip Chaos for Duelling or Illusion (depending on the trait line you had already before) to get more damage in because your group will also provide you regular healing, protection, regen, etc.
---
"Meta" builds are just that were made by people with another situation in mind. I'm pretty sure that if you sat at the table and thought about what you could do to make a full DPS build for you Chrono/Mirage (Core Mesmer is really meh currently) assuming you get all that support and boons you could come up with a build that is actually very very close to a "meta" build.
---
Let's get a quick example for the Chrono trait line assuming you wanna do a power DPS Chrono:
---
Adept trait:
---
* Delayed Reactions --&gt; Putitng slow and gaining alacrity if you interupt a foe (works on ennemies with breakbars, even when grey) can be nice to get a smotther Alacrity uptime and make sur that the boss has slow for your F1 (and maybe other traits we will see) but maybe there is something better because your alacrity will mostly be provided to you
---
* Time Catches Up --&gt; +10% damage for you shatters (pretty cool for your F1!) because a raid boss is bound to have some kind of movement impairing condition. You F1 hits hard and has a rather short CD so that's probably pretty worth it
---
* All's Well That Ends Well --&gt; Not really interesting to take this one when you can have +10% damage when you shatter and you will not have any Healing Power
---
Time Catches up it is imo.
---
Master trait:
---
* Danger Time --&gt; A great damage and crit chance increase against slowed ennemies for you AND your Phantasms (which is pretty rare for a mesmer trait), that looks pretty cool and a very good candidate for now
---
* Illusionary Reversion --&gt; You get a new clone if you shatter with 3, could be nice but then again you will have permanenet Alacrity and you are not a Mirage (ie. you only need to have 3 clones when you want to use your F1) so probably not really worth because you will be spamming enough clones as it is
---
* Improved Alacrity --&gt; Overall better cd reduction for the same amount of Alacrity, could be very interesting, without thinking too much I would say you'd need to do some testing (in a controlled environment like the Special Forces Training Area Golem where you can emulate a boss-like passive target with whatever condi you want and put whatever boon or class-related buff on you like Warrior Banners) to make sure which is better. My money is on Danger Time because getting bonus Critical Chance and Critical Damage to yourself and your phantasms looks really good (your phantasms only take on your Precision, not from rune/sigil/trait crit chance increase usually)
---
Danger Time looks better but it requires perma boss slow so maybe you'll find that Improved Alacrity is good enough for you.
---
Grandmaster trait:
---
* Lost Time --&gt; A small amount of damage and some slow when you CC a mob (also work on bosses with breakbars even in grey), could be interesting for your F1 and if you picked Danger Time
---
* Seize the Moment --&gt; Quickness when you shatter, not really that interesting compared to the previous one considering Quickness hsould be provided to you
---
* Chronophantasma --&gt; Your Phantasms attack twice instead of just once, that's a pretty huge deal if you end up using a lot of phantasms (and they hit very hard now), so if you end up finding that you often cast phantasms it's probably way better than Lost Time
---
Chronophantasma looks very good imo.
---
All the choices I explained there, it's not to force someone to play X or Y because I want to, it's  because they makes sense in the specific setup of Raids/Fractals considering what the support roles you are supposed to bring to a DPS. You can apply this to most trait lines, gear, utility choice, etc... and end up with a build that is really close to what people optimized.
---
Saying you only want to play that 1 flavor of Mesmer you built yourself and don't want to build any other one is a bit of a wasted potential when you have so many ways to play Mesmer/Chrono/Mirage and other classes. Even if it may be weird at first going a bit out of your confort zone will help you better understand your class and other classes and maybe discover something else you like.
---
I'm actually surprised WP didn't put a gw2skills link in the description.
---
&gt; Most positive changes to games occur because people point out areas that could be improved. There's no harm in doing so.
---
No, most positive changes in games occur because the developers agree its a positive change. Right now, you are not even pointing anything out to them because you are talking about your utopian trading society off topic in a reddit thread about spirit shards.
---
You havent posted a suggestion topic about your proposed changes here or on the official forums in years, if ever.
---
If it was such a positive change, why didnt Anet do it?
---
Do you by any chance know the exact locations of those broken portals in open world?
---
Thanks!
---
How do you think character recovery works?
---
This is awesome, thanks! One suggestion i would give is, is it possible to colour code the cells based on how close you are to getting the correct amount of items? Where red is when you have very little, and goes to orange/yellow to green? So when you look at the spreadsheet, its immediately obvious what materials you are lacking. :)
---
oo yeah you're right i forgot the subtle fog that winter's heart creates.
---
You need to make a copy of the spreadsheet then enter your personal inventory API.
---
I hate that outfit already
---
I always assumed character deletion becomes permanent after certain amount of time, I was wrong it seems.
---
More on it: [Restoring a deleted character](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010181213-Restoring-a-Deleted-Character)
---
lol
---
well,imagine how many ppl gona do 4 meta events,which gona take about an hour for a 0,0001 chance to drop infu. no1 is THAT crazy.
---
I heard it gives extra loot if its killes faster. Do we know the minute it needs to be killed for max rewards?
---
Does giving NPC a symbol if you have a tag work? :D
---
Yeah I hope they'll become like Elite Tauren Chieftain, although maybe that's where they got the inspiration from.
---
What's the drop rates of the cool legion weapons from that Khan ur thing?
---
Nope. Haven't touched them... mainly 'cause I was so horrible at the Beetle. Not 100% sure what pushed me to get this one. Probably just 'cause it was part of the map meta achieve.
---
The tshirt is a good call because it shows how the effect is displayed on skin and not armor, aswell as being neutral enough not to take away from showing the infusion.
---
"Meta builds" are not evil builds. They are there to provide you with the most optimal build to clear content at ease if you put effort knowing your skills/rotation. I hate it how people prefer non-optimal builds because of the word "meta". True you can play however/whatever you want but dont expect content will be easier for you in which way possible as long you dont put effort in it or running around in tanky gear it will take more time to clear content. In higher content you will get kicked for performing bad even if you would go back to FFXIV it expects the same thing putting effort in your class by knowing your rotation and skills. And dont say  the builds are the same for each role there which is false as i myself am playing FFXIV at the moment and there is still optimal meta builds aswell as non optimal builds. In the end optimal"Most Effective Tactic Avaible" &gt; your build.
---
The char helm comes from the Khan ur chest you do daily with the four keys.
---
I'd also like to know about the shoulder
---
IF WE COULD FISH THE IRON FORGEMAN OUT OF SORROWS EMBRACE...it'll be a hell of a concert mechanic to avoid the pouring vats of lava.
---
Tbh I can understand people who don't want to play a meta build because they just don't want to copy a build someone else made. It's not an approach that works well for people looking to go into endgame content, but I can understand the mindset, and this appears to be the case for OP.
---
What I could never get my head around, is people who make threads saying that they don't want to play a meta build, and then in the next sentence ask other people to give them non-meta builds to play. That makes no sense.
---
You mention the expansions are more enjoyable with better zones and elite specs. Is this something you can still experience if you buy the expansion reaching 80 or are new (returning - 6  years) players better off starting with the expansions?
---
Sorry for entruding in this comment but you seem to explain things rather well :)
---
stand on the one on the opposite side that he is smashing. When you stand on the platform you are high enough to be able to jump over the ice wave
---
And doing it like that makes it a exploit. Thankfully you have your accountname in the video so should be easy for ArenaNet to handle it.
---
&gt; You have to start someplace.
---
your social economy fantasies started over 6 years ago.
---
&gt; They're more likely to read off topic posts in a Reddit thread about Spirit Shards than they are to read the official forums.
---
your source?
---
and why are they more likely to read off topic comments on reddit rather than specific suggestion post by yourself on reddit?
---
&gt; You could say the same about a thousand other things in the game. They can take forever to act. I mean it's only this year (hopefully) that we'll get build templates in the game, and that one's a no-brainer!
---
But with build templates they acknowledged long ago that it is something they would like to introduce because they think its a good idea.
---
I dont see any similar support for your changes either from the player base or Anet.
---
&gt; Still, at least you liked my idea about making it more transparent to users what daily and weekly prices for items were, making them less likely to buy/sell at the immediate price on an item likely to change value in the near future.
---
Even though I dont think I said that here, I wouldnt mind if the tp ui also showed price graphs. However, considering how laggy the tp already is, I doubt they will add additional features that could slow performance down even more, especially because those ressources are even easier to access via 3rd party apps than build templates. And even if they do, most players probably wont change their selling/listing prices just because they see a graph of the price evolution. They sell immediately because they want instant gratification and reward.
---
Its not allowed to do in record runs
---
&gt; **the process is** ***not*** **guaranteed.**  If the character was deleted too long ago ...
---
Which means it still might be possible :) so it would seem characters stay even if they are deleted.
---
Many people are complaining that the wouldn't be able to use it on multiple chars. But why should Anet remove the shoulder skin when giving a option for a infusion, maybe make a little quest like op said, maybe like 100 gold more  and you get the infusion as *additional* unlock. I would love that option myself because I would love To be able to wear actual shoulders plus the effects of nightfury and/or  winter's presence.
---
JP rare drop? Or from that vault?
---
I think the shirt itself is ok, but those pants are just terrible
---
You: It's their mechanic
---
Me, an ele that can't switch to a melee weapon mid-combat: I guess I'll die.
---
They didn't "Enter a stance", they were 100% immune to ranged attacks. It was so fun that Anet eventually removed it.
---
Also, they don't have stealth.
---
Then plot twist, it's actually sea dragon that impersonate jormag
---
Can you make an actual screenshot?
---
You can't burst elite mobs and champ mobs dude. It doesn't matter how high your dps is. Burst is good for pvp and wvw, but not pve. You'd need to constantly be with someone else or use hit and run tactics.
---
Well you can do 4 metaevents every day for free chance to get it. Or map completion or reward tracks.
---
Of course it will be expensive as there is literally zero suppy *yet*, but over time...it matters how many people will play.
---
That’s pretty damn awesome! Something to work towards for my flame legion Charr for sure.
---
Nah, you can sell high karma account to the Russians or Chinese or something and they'll use it as botting accounts.
---
Boss has roughly 11.7 million HP, kill time was 11:27 which gives a DPS of \~17k DPS
---
They are in your wardrobe/novelty tab.
---
They're not.
---
Send a ticket to support.
---
You can try and use gw2timer website using your api and see if you are able to locate them using search function. Your best bet would be to contact support and see if they will be able to help you out though.
---
It was Lyssa all along. Dragons and gods dont exist, it's just one mesmer and her illusions.
---
Thanks I guess I cant do anything else but to send a ticket. It is still weird that they just dissapeared
---
So far we know it ca be looted from the container you get from vault, map completion, reward track, and such.
---
But as people dropped home instance node from some meta events, it is certainly possible that even the infusion can be included somewhere else, aka even on JP. Need more data for it to confirm or deny though.
---
Okay, I have no idea what " **Quanzi Gashou** " is, but:
---
1) download &amp; install GW2
---
2) make a character
---
3) play through the very first mission until you're in the real open world
---
4) click on the two crossed swords symbol in the top left corner of your screen
---
5) "enter lobby"
---
6) travel to the "arena" waypoint (bottom left)
---
7) annoy somebody until he beat the crapp out of you
---
\------------
---
8) then maybe google what build is meta on sPvP for your chosen class and apply it
---
9) go back to the arena and get beat up again
---
The difference between their skill and your skill will tell you how much of a difference skill makes in GW2.
---
I find PoF harder solo. I don’t know if that’s just because I’m out of practice or I’ve not updated my builds well enough. HoT came out before I had kids so I managed to play it through and take my time. PoF came out just before my first child was born so I had to rush it and I’ve not really explored the maps. I’ve not played the last living world at all. 2 kids now, no time.
---
You can restore 7 years deleted toon atm
---
I solved this problem by installing windows 7 more stable and less memory hungry. Although foe those That have AMD rysen 3 gen cpu windows 10 is kinda the only way to go since they don't support windows 7 as they claim
---
There are more kinds of harvesting tools that were there, but always max just one of them at time. previously it was cosmic ones or the flute etc. 
---
So if you do want to get more kinds, choya ones won't be only ones there.
---
I guess the first reason to place buyorders is to get rid of liquid gold, cuz the cap is 200k.
---
&gt; What I could never get my head around, is people who make threads saying that they don't want to play a meta build, and then in the next sentence ask other people to give them non-meta builds to play. That makes no sense.
---
That is called a fashion hipster.
---
&gt; If you're playing a DPS build, your build has to do decent damage. [...]
---
&gt; Benchmarks aren't important.
---
Uh ?
---
It is valid reason to just store it even if it would not affect the account in any way. Permanent deletion is dangerous tool to play with, and hard drive space is relatively cheap. So it is always better to store it, backup it few more times, than lose it forever.
---
DH loses juice on the long run. Better burst, but lower DPS.
---
The game scales you down so you still have some level of challenge in lower zones so everything is still relevant. 
---
I would recommend levelling normally through the core game by exploring, running the dungeons and events and doing a bit of crafting later on. The story is okay (depends on which paths you take, some are definitely more fun than others). For a first playthrough, you can get away with just following your nose and doing whatever you think is fun. 
---
The core zones are definitely populated, but I think it gets better over time. There is more challenge and a greater variety and better storytelling in the higher level zones. The game has a focus on events more than quests, but that doesn't really begin to shine until you get to about level 70.
---
And Nightfury.      My necromancer charr looks really skinny without his big shoulders. It's why I cannot use Nightfury even though I want to.
---
It says Black Citadel not Hoelbrak on the flyer so it doesn't add up completely.
---
But I still think this would be a great idea!
---
Wanted to share our static progress, we buckled up a lot in this try and it still turned out to be our best &gt;&lt;
---
really exited to see what others would do setupwhise, etc - hope that ln doesnt crush us the day after i post this xD

[BEHOLD! A HITBOX!](https://gfycat.com/hatefulhighethiopianwolf)
---
&gt; your source?
---
They respond far more frequently to reddit posts than forum posts, stands to reason they read more too. 
---
&gt;and why are they more likely to read off topic comments on reddit rather than specific suggestion post by yourself on reddit?
---
Because often suggestion threads get completely buried. 
---
&gt;But with build templates they acknowledged long ago that it is something they would like to introduce because they think its a good idea.
---
They rarely announce their plans in advance. Just because they haven't done something doesn't mean they don't think it would be a good idea. Don't assume.
---
My entire point is that players should not have to use third party locations. Those work for people who take the TP seriously, but work poorly for casual players. You kept talking about how traders "fill buy/sell orders because they're just too impatient to wait like a savvy TPer." I think that's almost never the case. I think it's more likely that they don't *understand* the fluctuations of the market. They don't *track* prices over time, they just look at the TP as it exists that minute and make their best guess as to what's fair. 
---
Can you seriously tell me that you believe that a built-in system of better informing players of daily and weekly pricing would not lead to an overall shift towards more profitable decision-making, even though those tools have always been available outside the game? Could you be that dishonest, just to prove a point?
---
I don't think graphs would be necessary, it wouldn't need to get that detailed. Like I said, it would just need to color code "life" buy/sell orders by "this is the last one posted 24 hours ago," "this is the last one posted 7 days ago," and if either of those conditions would be *within* the existing margin, then it would also post the highest/lowest price an item was placed at within those margins. 
---
So for example, say an item right this minute has buy orders at 5s and sell orders at 6s. And let's say those are the closest together those numbers have been in a week. In the buy order side, if you scrolled down a bit, you'd find that everything under 4.6s is yellow, because that's the lowest it got in 24 hours. If you keep scrolling, at 4.3s, it's red, because that's the lowest it's been this week. Similar on the sell orders, everything above 6.2 would be yellow and everything above 6.7 would be red. 
---
Now if the current prices weren't the closest, if earlier in the week the prices had been 5.6 and 4.3 at some point, then those figures would be in red respectively in the lists above the current value, and yellow figures for the highest/lowest daily prices. 
---
Now, this wouldn't give the long term outlook that players would need to track seasonal progress or anything, but it would at least give them a better outlook on how weekly and daily cycles play out. I think that if players understood this better, and didn't have to alt-tab out to look up graphs for every single item they wanted to throw out there, they would do a much better job of pricing their items at a price that would likely sell within the day/week, but would have a much better profit than if they just cashed in a buy order or grabbed the lowest sale order out there and shaved a copper off it.
---
Wait - Collector's Edition includes a cat? Damn, now I want it too!
---
Well they were adding music boxes even as recently as PoF, so I would say that might still be possible. For example the Jp can have some rare loots that we don't know yet, as there is not big enough sample of people looting it. Who knows... :)
---
It seemed like you kited the hand projectile. Does it target the furthest person away?
---
Make infusions wardrobe finally. Would drive down price a bit too I'd imagine.
---
It's a cover.
---
is this the real life? 
---
is this just clickbait? 
---
caught in a landslide
---
no escape from my vidya games
---
sPvP has the highest rewards ingame. Why even more?
---
That’s fucking dope
---
Thanks. It's actually Shreddage 3 Jupiter and Perfect Drums.
---
I get 2 loot drops from them on quite regular basis without killing anything. If double roll, one can get something like 2+1, 3+1, 4+1, 3+2.... My record so far is 4+2 from one node so far.
---
Devourers do drop them sometimes, that's true.
---
I use normal tool, with bounty tool it would be probably way bigger deal.
---
Guys don't even bother engaging, just look at his post history, he spams shit posts all the time.
---
Do they still sell collector's editions?
---
No you quit because Guild Wars is a game only for retarded
---
&gt;I stopped playing because everyone says that "Guild Wars 2 is for retarded players" and I don't want to be compared to retarded people. I feel like it's kind of shame to play Guild Wars 2 these days.
---
Probably because she has been the only girl in the guild for a very long time... would been better if more ladies joined
---
YES.
---
What's this?
---
There's color everywhere.
---
I hope you aren't building your own rotation or opener in ffxiv; you'll be dragging down others in savage.
---
Oh, it's you again.
---
it only has style when you crush someones record 3hours after it has been posted to reddit
---
Scourge main condi is bleed, then torment. And since you can't place shades (you lose effects around you) but you need the trait modifiers that amplify your damage the more shades you have up, its a big hit.
---
 also youd only be able to use them on one character, since infusions arent account wide wardrobe unlocks. 
---
thats the entire point of this post - the RRMR is an exotic item that grants the winters aura, but it doesnt have a unique skin which is unlocked in the wardrobe. so you can only use it on one char.
---
Nice
---
It wouldn't hurt to build a map around casuals, yet add a HoT style meta event that caters to the people who want more difficult content as well. (They just need to make sure the map meta is an additive and isn't 100% the purpose of the map like in HoT)
---
That's about all the info I needed to be reassured of my choice.
---
I'll be playing the core game until I find the need to delve into expansions, thanks!
---
It feels like an intro to the concept of pve. It's made for the people who've never put more thought into the game than serving world bosses. And for that it works, just hope they ramp up the challenge so those players can improve more and more tho.
---
There's some left in Amazon or Ebay, either used or new. Prices vary but likely expensive.
---
you really thing people would just go on the internet and type some words and other people would believe them?
---
which isn't a one-shot
---
Stopped playing (for a while) don't mean I quit it
---
Stunning and brave.
---
Open your eyes
---
Look up to the skybox and seeeeee
---
&gt; I stopped playing because everyone says that "Guild Wars 2 is for retarded players" and I don't want to be compared to retarded people. I feel like it's kind of shame to play Guild Wars 2 these days.
---
Okay, sure
---
Thank you so much! Found:)
---
Only thing that matters to me is are you effective. Play whatever build you want, as long as you are able to do your role. If your teammates are doing 20k dps and you are doing 7k and not contributing in any other way, you are doing something wrong.
---
I want to make an eyepatched charr with that face so badly.
---
I figured it'd be tied to makeover kits like the last facial updates.
---
which is weird because with proper timing you can just dodge the wave
---
As the OP said there are two types of chests just from killing the boss. The bouncy ones which atleast are daily, and the actual chests that spawn on the arena after killing the boss. I have heard ppl talking that the non-bouncy chests could be farmed. But the question is, where does the chair and the shoulders drop from.

mmoga is not an approved seller by the Lionguard and can lead to trouble if bought from. Just stick with the approved merchants so I don't have to come bail you out, recruit.

Well rank gives additional pips, thus more rewards.

I have the same problem, its stomper #1 for me which is located in dalada forest.

Please try to post an HD video of this someone, I want to really get a good look at this, looks bad as of right now. lol
---
why don't you want to play a meta build though?
---
anything for ppl with 23/25? :D
---
I recommend going to your boss saying you have developed your own method for your task, you want the same money and will from now on take four times longer for your tasks than before and a fair number of tasks will not even ever be finished. If he says that's nonsense tell him he is a meta nazi who knows no fun.
---
I once having the same question. 
---
My recommendation is that you take the Griffon first. The Griffon is  easier to get (not THAT easy) and will make your life much better when you run around LS4 map.
---
For everyone gathering viotipe magic, i suggest my video about the skyscale jahai bouffs ride. With two Characters you are able to collect the open world cap in around five Minutes. Start in jahai bluffs from the waypoint with the magic vendor and head up the mountains east.
---
His Patreon Giveaway is no scam, I won 2 legendaries the last 2 months and actually got them
---
"1. I'm not well equipped"
---
- well, there are ways you can equip your characters, you can farm gold and craft the ascended gear necessary, you can do the daily high fractals tier for ascended boxes, PVP and wvw also give boxes. You wanna start getting into raids? start putting some effort 1st.
---
"2. For the love of God, I don't want to play a "meta" build."
---
What's wrong with meta builds? Chances are those "meta" builds are more fun to play than your build for the simple fact that they are better on everything they do compare with yours.
---
"My build is one I came up with on my own. I'm goddamn proud of it (my friend said I'd never been able to put anything together, so I worked really hard on it to prove him wrong)."
---
Saying you are proud of your build and proved your friend wrong means absolutely nothing. What kind of build are you running? Is your Mesmer build a DPS build, a support boon build, is it power or conditions? Have you tested your build on golem for example to see the limitations of your build or did you just played some open-world stuff with it and decided you "proved wrong to your friend".
---
Thing is my friend there is no build/class in this game that does NOT work in open-world metas. Even nomad thief with Madking runes works in open-world.
---
Everything
---
well yea they're definetly more than 10k, they haven't even been traded on the ingame TP for a while, not even on the gw2 exchange reddit, but I guess it doesn't even matter for the point I'm trying to make, one of the CES was appearently gifted to them aswell so w/e...
---
About the clickbait, yea I guess some of that is clickbait, which is fine to a certain degree, but obviously I as a non competitor probably cares less than somebody who's more involved with these records.. but they also show the stuff they're giving away in every video (by opening inventory), now they don't have colored item borders enabled, but in some of their videos they hover over the items and the items indeed seem to be Legendaries, not just skinned crapgear. Could still be faked ofcourse.
---
Not sure why bots would need outfits as rewards...
---
There might be an easier explanation for this.
---
Those giveaways are always to get more attention to yourself one way or the other. Currently 10,000 gold is "only" $343.78 which isn't that much really. A lot of those things in those giveaways could come from promotions that Content creators get like IIRC WP got some gem cards to give to the fanbase from ArenaNet. If they save those up or use themselves then they can already turn that into gold easily. Another thing is that with enough views you probably get more out of it than you have put in at some point when it is monetized and especially you can have countless of videos with little effort about "ohh only two weeks left, register now or you won't get a thing" and rack the monetization for multiple videos.
---
Patreon is also a big thing because you probably never have just the right amount you need to pay your bills and the excess money could also flow into the price pool.
---
I'm always a bit reluctant with player made giveaways because you will never know the origin of the items. They could be legitimate or bought with Shady RMTs and with ArenaNets policy to ban everyone involved I just see a reason to risk my account.
---
One more infusion to ignore that it exists then.
---
Thank you for your sacrifice, Commander.
---
I do this every day with skyscale
---
I could use some more Obsidian Shards :P
---
500 of the map currency
---
Exotics for me, but yeah... it made me work on that death counter.
---
I have both and barely touch gripphon since u have skyscale.

It is better for farming

---
no, it emphasizes how out of touch the whiny WvW/PvPers really are if they cant acknowledge the cold hard facts of what I said. They should be thankful the modes exist at all, but asking dev time and effort when they make such a tiny, minuscule part of the playerbase (and likely in turn, revenue for the company) is the textbook definition of entitlement
---
PvE is what the vast, overwhelming majority of people play in GW2, and it's status quo being subject to wild swerves due to changes for  modes that are barely a fraction of a fraction *of a fraction* as popular is downright stupid.
---
Full alac isn't going to happen open world except at events. And if I'm standing in the shade, I might as well not have one and because I'm already melee.
---
Don't get me wrong. I really hope I'll win about this. But I'm pretty sure I'm not.
---
Watching players like you do dungeons will never not be great!
---
I have forgotten a /s at the end of the sentence. Pretty much every so-called leak today has Steve involved somewhere
---
Recovered chart artefact but no one’s dropped it yet
---
I'm rich you know
---
How dare you challenge the killer commander Risen Howl of NA's greatest guild KRTA
---
IMO you are basing your opinion more on your gut feeling instead of real numbers. "It doesn't add up so it has to be a scam" or something like that.
---
Only they know how much money they make and everything you can know are estimates without any proof really.
---
"Can" and "could" and everything in between is not really something to go on especially not by saying that this is a scam, it might or might not be for all we know.
---
After hearing about the WP video about the richest players in the game and how they made it one went to a couple thousand gold in a matter of months. I would imagine that this can be extrapolated the more gold you have the more you will make.
---
This shouldn't prevent you to view this critically, heck I think there is something more going on here but since I don't know and can't prove I will not make some judgement which, most of the time, posts like yours do tend to produce. The easiest explanation is that this is a scam and easy explanations is what people love.
---
It could all be legitimate or it could all be a scam. We probably never will find out though and guessing will not help anyone really.
---
TBH they might actually be giving this stuff away.  Between Patreon &amp; YT money, donations from their followers, and possibly even doing their own legit in-game gold making, they might be legitimately acquiring and giving away the wealth that they claim.
---
How is that spoilery?
---
If this is the player I think it is, he also makes videos about how to be a very successful trader on the post and how to make lots of money and any number of other things.
---
Almost certainly someone who has probably 30 to 50 players farming for him and just using spirit shards like currency like other folks have talked about using here lately. A little fame, a little skill at PVP as well as WVW, and there you go.
---
as someone else mentioned as well, he has a patreon community that is giving him money, again assuming it's the same person I am thinking of, he has a discord community, the guy is leveraging social media to his advantage.
---
We swapped a DH for a Firebrand, else their were just some smaller changes I think.
---
All world bosses need more movement than just standstill golem punching bag
---
How cute, you thought I was asking
---
Yeah --- this isn't worth my time. Go back to fractals -- I've heard they were worth the development time.
---
Any effective guides how to train Weaponsmith profession? Thanks :)
---
I figured people dont pug raids, or if they did they did it via semi-private discords. 
---
I play generally at about 3AM Pacific. Even Mondays or Tuesdays. Nothing.
---
Most died by trying to dumb themselves down and appeal to the wow fanboy crowds.   
---
They would have been very much alive and well if they sticked to their original audience instead.
---
You are saying you are playing in the middle of the night when the least amount of people are playing and you are surprised that people aren't playing raids?
---
Post a picture please! I tried to do this years ago and I couldn't make one I liked. I'd love to see your take!
---
No, winter presence and nightfury are both shoulder skins which are invisible save for the snow or bat effect. It can throw off a lot of fashion no having shoulder guards.
---
You can us them on any characters by just transmuting a shoulder skin.
---
Sigh...
---
Features like superfetch and memory compression are usually disabled by default for SSD drives.
---
The meager speed up when loading applications in memory is not worth the extra strain on SSD drives with the added background write operations those features will cause.  
---
New SSD drives are not affected as much by that, but they are still affected, so the older the SSD drive the more prone to have a shorter lifespan due to disk writes, and the least you use the computer to access a variety of programs and files the more you should disable them.  
---
This thread is about GW2's performance specifically.  It doesn't matter how faster RAM is, since prefect and superfetch do practically nothing for GW2 or most games for that matter. GW2 keeps its files in a virtual drive, the GW2.dat where they can only be accessed by the GW2.exe.
---
So if one has an older computer with an older SSD, chances are these features are already disabled anyways
---
can i get a link to this thief build?
---
Hello i am calling from WvW were our rewards are absoutely terrible. Could we get the rewards PvP get today please before PvP get more rewards? Ktxb!
---
And chop that sucker up good!
---
Hmmm i have 50 characters... this will take a while :D
---
It's *amazing* how much the masteries change TD. From wandering around for hours to being able to cross the map in about a minute.
---
any reason for the firebrand? or just player preference?
---
I have the same wish. I made a charr mesmer that I never use cause it's a big charr and for jumping on tight spots is annoying (in JPs or fractals or raids). The reason I don't want to delete it is cause I have 500 tailor with many exclusive recipes. I hope they make this possible but not for 2500 gems. Either that or transfer all tailor stuff to another character.
---
It's an RNG drop from the reward you get from the Khan-Ur vault. You need to do all four meta's to open it.
---
It would be nice if they had at least 1 different song for each festival, like a neat [Wintersday Carol](https://youtu.be/coq9HcxtYGI).
---
We could also use "Medium Rare" playing in Meatoberfest.
---
It provides decent boss dps, without sb and rev buffs and also can easily block the projectiles from the hand in the split allowing the rev to play shiro instead of ventari. This alltogether allowed us to skip the rp at the first split.
---
Excuse me, but 1 person that makes a gold making guides, telling ppl to "do dailies, flip legendaries and participate in giveaways", outprofiting top 10 TP barons on the market + entire TP guild (the largest leggie crafting org in game) together on a monthly base .... is somewhat hard to believe.
---
Yes there might be donations from delusional ppl sending him stuff for no reason at all, but we cant know that for sure. Also his strong resistance to show his API key says there is something shady at least.
---
People have already gotten the emote by using stored up pvp or wvw daily potions on the Grothmar reward track.
---
Like I said, it could be the case but could also not be and there is insufficient evidence to create any conclusive results that might reflect reality.
---
What we know is that the price pool is huge and probably the value of Patreon subscriptions.
---
We assume that they don't make that much money by monetizing the videos.
---
You can't however say for certain how they acquired the price pool in any way, they could just play the trading post extensively and make a lot of gold because of it and then put that gold into the price pool or rely also on donations of players. I can still remember when WP got a lot of mount licenses that players gifted to him to open.
---
So, what else is there to say really. OP has made up their mind and expects US to prove them wrong. This seems to be a recurring them today in which people form their opinion on feelings and incomplete data.
---
I don't know what is going on there, of course it sounds weird but I don't have any more information to form a conclusive opinion.
---
Any way the meta goes, doesn't really matter to me...
---
To me...
---
I bought that the second day. Didn’t know it was rare xD
---
Nah prolouge is also only playable if you own pof. 
---
Source my vanilla alt account
---
Exactly. 
---
An example I recall right now that that rang a bell is a sentence that said something like "we've been declawed" (no this exact sentence, I can't recall the exact words), a rethoric that can be found in nationalist discourse claiming to going back to "greater times" or even in mysoginistic messages that usually go with "men are being emasculated by [insert abstract enemy]", which are usually used along the other case I mentioned.
---
I believe the new shoulder skin can either be bought of the TP, or a drop from the strike mission.
---
Nope my HoT only alt cannot play the prologue
---
That's exactly what I was looking for, thanks.
---
I believe you can also use the peppers for new cooking recipes. They’re account bound, so you’d have to be certain that you won’t ever want to make that food.
---
do you have any idea how to add guildbank aswell? i tried but it seems harder then i thought...
---
- cries about games dying   
---
- resorts to elitist neckbeard basement dweller when presented with arguments   
---
You are hilarious son.
---
Isn't there, with materias ?
---
well, it's not entirely just feelings, i've previously checked tp trading values as i've said, and the numbers don't match up, i wouldn't have made this thread if i wasn't certain about some stuff. 
---
And you are completely right
---
&gt; People are forming their opinion on incomplete data or their feeling rather than the facts or doing some research previously.
---
And i'd be very happy to receive the missing information to form a more established opinion, until then I' wont completely judge, but I'm still gonna have my opinion.
---
And also who is it up to decide who has to prove something? why do i have to prove anything? I'm just gonna sit here and have my opinion, if they don't like it they're very welcome to prove me wrong, if they don't want to, then thats not my problem, i'm not here to defame anyone, however i can see how someone could think that, which is why i don't want to mention any names. If it's obvious who i'm talking about, then i guess thats unlucky for them.....
---
It's strange cause when HoT first launched it was even HARDER. It was amazingly dangerous to even walk down the first mound of verdant brink, and I loved it, but of course people went up in arms about the difficulty and it got nerfed.
---
It's still a bit of a challenge but one of the first goals they had were to make more builds viable. They distinctly said that if you were gonna run into HoT with full berserkers, you were gonna have a bad time. We needed to switch up our builds and think more about utility than vomiting dps to clear any problem.
---
Then everyone went in with berserkers anyway, died, and complained that they couldn't kill a mob in a single rotation (keep in mind this is also before anyone either had elite specs, or even knew how to build them proper, so it's not like everyone could nuke at 30k dps)
---
i support this
---
&gt; You can't burst elite mobs and champ mobs dude.
---
I don't know if youre trolling or not, but champion mobs are almost exclusively group content and usually associated with an event that labels them that way specifically.
---
Elite mobs are soloable, but before you change to bad gear you should look at your weapon choices and utility skills to see what you can do to mitigate their damage. A blind field or lots of blocks or lots of CC, or even invuln buttons can carry you through fights with elites effortlessly regardless of what gear you wear.
---
For example, take a warrior...
---
Berserker gear + Endure Pain &gt; Soldiers Gear + signet of Fury
---
just 2 correction:
---
1. His gold making guides SUX
---
2. In order to give away 5 CES in a month, you have to be able to buy 5 CES in a month. There are no 5 CES sold on tp in a montly base in the past 2 years, and the few sold there are not going to him (i know ppl that are in que for next 10-15 CES). There are not 5 CES sold in exchange in last 2 months. Unless he found a way to dupe them, i would say, his sourse of aquiring SUPER SUPER SUPER RARE items is shady
---
Yea I'm all for "innocent 'til proven guilty" and not making accusations without having reliable evidence.
---
Just agreeing with OP that the whole thing smells a bit fishy.
---
I mean just look at the numbers.
---
The most valuable account on gw2eff is at something around 1.1mil gold.
---
The controversial youtuber gave away items worth 500k within just one month.
---
Let that sink in for a moment.
---
But how it is now it forces you to use the shoulder slot for it. You can't wear the winter presence with any of the scarves, for example, or with any of the winter outfits. 
---
The best solution is a new entry in the wardrobe for 'extra visual effects' with at least 6 slots in which you can put any unlocked effects, then adding there all the visuals from infusions and other visuals like Nightfury, Winter's Embrace, Bloodstone Visage, the Karka helmet, etc.
---
As a male playing both male and female characters I also am bothered by this. I want my commanders to be covered up appropriately for the environment they're fighting in. And bikinis dont work in any combat situation.
---
&gt; There's nothing like HoT maps on release. There are things that have somewhat comparable difficulty, but the experience is utterly different.
---
hot on release was pure frustration. people seem to forget that nobody had mounts back then. navigating around was such a pain in the ass.
---
Team 4's project maybe?
---
My third cousin, twice removed, who works for ArenaNet says this is false.
---
WP hardly ever does timestamps or links, because he doesn't want people to skip through things as he explains everything in detail. So much detail
---
If you do not have or plan to get all the other mounts get the skyscale. It's a clunky POS at times but also a jack-of-all-trades, plus probably cheaper overall. If you have all the other mounts fully mastered and hotkeyed those will outperform the skyscale in their own niches and the griffon is far better for extensive flying.
---
Or a raptor + bond of Faith iirc
---
&gt; Let that sink in for a moment.
---
Yeah, that is why I said the following at the end of my initial comment 
---
&gt; I'm always a bit reluctant with player made giveaways because you will never know the origin of the items. They could be legitimate or bought with Shady RMTs and with ArenaNets policy to ban everyone involved I just don't see a reason to risk my account.
---
It looks weird and that is why I don't participate but I also don't jump to conclusions as OP did.
---
&gt;Well first of all, this isn't nearly compareable to Mr. Beast,
---
Neither is the amount of money he's giving away. 
---
Smaller viewerships &amp; smaller giveaways... i don't see the problem here? 
---
&gt; And for a Youtuber who claims on their Patreon to not be able to do this fulltime until they hit 800 Patreons
---
That claim could just be a bullshit way to get more people to support him though. I see no reason to take that at face value. 
---
&gt;doesn't seem to me that they'd have 20k bucks a month to spend on giveaways...
---
It doesn't seem to be that large of a giveaway EVERY month though. He could simply be saving up.
---
oh it's you :p
---
that actually sounds great yes, didn't think of that
---
Yes, I am aware but I cannot fathom why he would hide such thing like some boombox with metal legion songs.
---
Brain leaks.
---
Also about 30% obvious things so can always say "they changes make kek, I still good leaker"
---
Does it count towards the meta achievement?
---
&gt; it could've made a fun achievement unlock!
---
Surely you mean a gemstore unlock.
---
I did and it worked. Thank you :-)!!
---
Ah good, it doesn't give any AP..
---
\*Glares at Ember Bay\*
---
Did you find something to play that's not faceroll?
---
Because shipments are a lot more profitable than boxes that are sold for UM. VM is also faster to farm since ls3 doesnt have any good map metas.
---
Exactly
---
If my time with DCUO is any indication this will never stop and continue exponentially. People love their weird swirly bits
---
There's 3 helms I've seen that are new.
---
The [Khan-Ur one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gaze_of_the_Khan-Ur) that you get from the [Recovered Charr Artifacts](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/%22Recovered%22_Charr_Artifact) that drop from the Khan-Ur vault after you get the 4 keys (from the major events) to open it as well as map completion.
---
And there's two other helms that are on the Blood Legion Charr Npcs that I don't think are attainable. The two are [this smoother one](https://i.imgur.com/dKJMS5b.jpg) and [this more pointy one](https://i.imgur.com/fzqopiJ.jpg).
---
So honestly it *all* comes down to effort and how much time the artists spend on the armor pieces. So they tried harder on one armor set and not another, for whatever reason. The most likely explanation is either their personal bias or whichever one they started working on first (less fatigued in whatever sense), or a combination the two.
---
In this case, I'm not even sure it's that big a difference. The texture files probably look really really similar to each other. To me the general aesthetic of this armor on male characters is unappealing in its silhouette, but that's a matter of personal taste.
---
If you dont like it you can just leave the event.
---
You know, your own post would have been quite better had you refrained from writing tha last part.
---
For that alone I'll rate it 5/10, could have been higher.
---
I actually do the waterfalls In mountain map too (do not remember the name) near the one rift to the other and up to the mastery point
---
Tuesday evening + Wednesday a big part of the day without trying to optimize too much. So should be possible to get 54 achievs in the weekend or worst case if you only play few hours per week during the coming week.
---
This is one of the biggest turn offs for me right now: fun new stuff that I want to try locked behind insanely terrible rng drop rates.
---
Well yea I've kinda made up my mind in the way that I'd say something is definetly fishy, I just don't know which exact part that is.. If that makes any sense... but that is enough for me to not support it but also to raise questions publicly, and try to gather more opinions, you know generally I love to be proven wrong or teached in an enlightening manner if that brings clarification for myself and eventually having my own questions answered which I've been pondering over. (Im just witty in the way that I really like to heavily question things, even if the questions sometimes seem silly). but until then I'm definelty going to advise not to support it, since neither A-Net nor said people have ever kinda opened up to this topic. Which brings me to another topic is why is everything nowdays so in-transperent? why can nobody clearly say something without it being a puzzle, it's quite annoying especially with big companies, they always answer very vague, probably also for legal reasons.
---
I would think it would be shrunk down some to work as a glider.
---
It's not too hard to add- have a look at conditional formating. Create a colour scale with minpoint, midpoint and endpoint and apply to the appropriate cells.
---
Literally any competitive game.
---
Destiny/Division.
---
WoW/FFXIV. I suspect ESO has a hardcore aspect too.
---
All games with a dedicated hardcore aspect that's actively developed. The market adapted. Lifestyle games in this decade absolutely understand the value of difficulty.
---
&gt;Taimi Cleansed by Aurene
---
While I could see ANet doing that, it seems more likely that they would save her by her, or especially Gorrik in a fit of grief, transferring her mind into her Golem. Like everything that happened with Blish and just how reliant her character has been on Scruffy, just feels like a Chekhov's gun.
---
I got a Shoulders Box yesterday from the Bouncy (Daily). Still no report on it being from the Physical Chest (Non Daily).

could be left and or right click to interact?

Mr.Beast giveaways are transparent, but a giveaway carried out behind a discord bot? Maybe not so much, scam or not, this looks like someone “presuade” another to invest in some future profit that may or may not come, even Ponzi Scheme is less scary than this.
---
The Half-Norn, good times.

Sad. I really hoped that it would be stackable.

Do it!

Maybe if it only randomly spawns on a few people, I can't imagine how glitchy trying to parse social awkwardness bouncing on 50+ people would be.
---
Oh nice thanks mate!! Gonna download it now an try it.
---
ReShade does not interfers directly with the game. It's safe.
---
Just so you know, all projectile destruction skills were changed to block instead. I'm guessing this means they block the hit (damage packet) from the projectile but the physical projectiles continue to exist, and in Arkk's case, continue to bounce and leave AoE fields.
---
As far as I can tell this is intended functionality, FWIW.
---
And yet in a 50 minute video he never mentioned his equipment or spends 10 seconds total to hover over each item and always refers to his other video. Stonks up. But, in the other video he generalizes every gear set by saying "Just go for 100% crit chance 4Head"
---
Stonk
---
Your boy's got some HORNS.
---
Yep, that sounds about right.
---
Thanks :)
---
The leak is true because it doesn't mention fractals/raids/pvp
---
TBH the source isn't *really* what I care about, it's just the tip of the iceberg for me personally what I'm mostly interested in would be where the stuff goes, and why it is okay to buy random skins for patreon money but not for mm0ga money, if I just cared about the giveaways as probably 90% of the patreons do, why wouldn't I just go to pvpb@nk, it's cheaper and they could also put some lines like 
---
"hey lucky you, you won the giveaway" 
---
in the mail which contains my bought items... Not suggesting that I'd personally ever purchase ingame goods via 3rd parties.
---
There is nothing to prove or unprove here, it's obvious that you get ingame goods, if you're a Patreon, that's literally what they advertise on their Youtube. And that for me is RMT, and RMT is against the ToS, literally breaking the contract, rules are rules, and there shouldn't be exceptions. Again, just my opinion.
---
Divorce these things. There's no reason why they should be unified items.
---
No worries! I'm hoping this gets fixed, because power chrono is basically the only DPS build I play in fractals and knowing that I'm screwing over my group with focus #5 (an integral part of the DPS rotation) over this weird interaction feels awful!
---
Shit, I broke out accidentally and didn't think to go get that PoI.
---
ye i noticed this aswell few months back and i take it like a feature at this point.
---
Gameplay Rule #2 and 4 are redundancy no?
---
I am still thinking Taimi will put herself in a golem like her friend did to survive.
---
I meant socially, yes. Most of my friends perform well enough mechanically, and learn fast! But they're scared to death of actually 1) finding 9 other people and 2) submitting to the horrifying ordeal of being Seen and Known and Perceived by said 9 other people.
---
I personally don't feel like dungeons serve that role atm, if they did in the past I can't vouch for that. I've joined 'casual dungeon runs' where people just run past all the mobs, say nothing in the way of communication, leave 'the new guy' to die at the start and just whoosh past anything fun in terms of story for the place. I've spent hours stuck on a buggy dungeon run when trying to do an explorable for AC. AC IS LIKE A 'LOW LEVEL' ONE EVEN!? I have friends who won't run them unless they know the other four people out of fear of being Left Behind. I think a lot of people underestimate how many anxious folks play this game lol
---
~~As an aside, I think you MAY wanna think about how you phrased that. "Carrying a weak link." I've noticed a trend in recent years (maybe just me noticing something that has existed for longer,) of people boiling other players down to just their mechanical performance. It may help to remind yourself, on occasion, that those 'weak links' are human people, too. I've had to help boot an underperforming person from a raid group before, FFXIV but still. Its frustrating when there's someone in the group who is performing their role in the game below what the group needs. But remember that it's just that. That is a person. A person who is playing a game and not playing it well enough. The person is not a 'weak link.' The person is a person who is currently not good enough at the game to play in your group.~~
---
~~Being mindful of the phrasing you use goes a LONG WAY in terms of helping people not immediately quit the first time they do badly. "You're shit" is pretty harmful and I see it thrown around a lot. Not saying 'you' as in YOU ILKAR89 PERSONALLY saying like 'you' as in the raiding community? It makes me wonder if that 'boil a human person down to their raid utility' is part of what makes it so hard to break into raiding to begin with...?~~
---
Its ugly... like all the other infusions...
---
yep,but you can still open only 1 chest daily,so if price of 4 keys gona drop to 1g,you can try your 0,0001 chance every day =)
---
That's what I thought...in which case I kinda disagree with OP. 
---
If they're constantly at Grothmar, don't have them elsewhere.
---
The gameplay surrounding them is okay enough, but for all the love the concert/band is getting...personally it was a part of the new prologue that was just kinda cringey to me.
---
Not that I begrudge anyone else their enjoyment of it, but personally I wasn't a fan.
---
I think I get the idea, but can you help me add on shared inventory slots please? Is that more complicated if it has to check specific inventory slots? I assume it's otherwise better than inventories since it doesn't need to check all characters
---
Only need a Map Completion Route now! :D
---
Guild Wars 2 is given a small acknowledgement at 9:12.
---
it did, aurillium started from 10k.
---
Thats pretty nifty
---
The new char skins are terrible.. they look like level 10 armor skins. Please design something that goes well with the existing skins or don't give us anything at all..spend 100+ gold on that shit. The only content left in the game is fashion, please give us something decent.
---
I'm never going to get any of this RNG stuff.
---
My brother is a main Charr player and was ecstatic to explain to me any questions I had about charr society and personal story since I only play humans and norn.
---
However, once I got dumped out of the intro instance, I asked my brother what the deal was with the PA system, and he just said, "I dunno just charr stuff"
---
The PA system is active propaganda, and  I legitimately think it's efficient enough that some *players* don't realize it is.
---
"Warband above self. Legion above charr. Charr above all."
---
I 100% agree that it's a serious adult tone, in the same way older cartoons had adult tones. Gw2 is a very jovial game, but mostly just on the surface. The flame legion charr Cubs were demanded and forced into the Fahrar for indoctrination, it's a form of subjugation. 
---
Bangar is 100% a charismatic leader, and he manages to win over a ton if charr. For that matter, I think ||you know who|| can't be saved, too far gone.
---
Does it give access to the ball pit as well?
---
You can just go to the aerodrome and give yourself common raid buffs -quickness to simulate a full squad
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
How did you do it? I tried breaking out last night on my griffin but no dice
---
It is a pretty nice infusion though. Too bad everything has gone the 0.002% drop rate rng route
---
there are enough content creators out there who do just fine without ridiculous giveaways
---
\m/
---
true, but why police that?
---
There's some builds on metabattle for all elite specs and all kinds of content. But tbh most builds with the same role in the same game mode use the same 2 core specs as well as gear and most utility skills, whether it's a core class or with elite spec.
---
Core necro you'll want Spite 122, Soul Reaping 112, Bloodmagic 131. Weapons probably Axe Focus Warhorn, maybe dagger. Utilities are Well of Suffering, Signet of Spite, free utility slot (standard affair will be shadow fiend, spectral grasp if pulls are needed desired), elite flesh golem, healing skill- choice but recommend well of blood or blood fiend
---
If you could send to me also I would be very appreciative. Thanks
---
Don't destroy your legendary! Equiping it does the job just fine :) 
---
If you want to put the look (and effects) of Bifrost onto any other staff you will need a transmutation charge, yes.
---
maybe, but since we don't know the source of those items there is no telling if it is legitimate or not.
---
Don't get me wrong I think it is weird as well but I'm not someone who will say that this is a scam with knowing next to nothing. For all, we know they could be very wealthy, make a lot of youtube/patreon or anything really or just be good at playing the market.
---
I generally just try to avoid to make and rahs judgements without any real evidence.
---
Thanks, bought 2 bag slots for 145g. I really want the Crowned Ancient jackal skin but we still didn't get a select license for Mount Adopt License so I will pass.
---
&gt;DWARVES ARE BACK
---
Don’t do that. Don’t give me hope. If they were ever to add a new player race I would want dwarves and have for a long time. Them somehow coming back this season would be too good a setup to adding them as a player race in a future expansion. 
---
&gt;Taimi cleansed by Aurene.
---
Oh booooo now I hope this is fake. Partially disabled IRL and I feel like “healing” Taimi would be such a cop-out and sour message. I’d rather she learn to live with her condition rather than being deus ex machi-healed. 
---
Aaaaaa do I want dwarves or do I want Taimi to have a decent character arc??
---
Inconsistencies in my GW2 ? Outrageous ! This has never happened and for sure will never happen again ! /s 
---
Jokes aside, you get used to that kind of spaghetti. First time I brought CPC after whatever patch was that broke this I wiped my party twice till I figured what was going on. There's also the Sand Swell spaghetti that will cancel the portal and only shadowstep if you queue a movement command while casting and it's been like that since banners had the same bug.
---
Last i checked player trading wasnt an exploit.
---
I need my elite spirit weapon!
---
In my younger rapscallion days I ran a dishonest game of chance in EverQuest.  We were even supported by GMs as they would show up and provide items for us to raffle off.  Pay a plat, random 1000, closest to my secret number won. I never randomed for the secret number and no one ever found that suspicious, I just had it. My friend won the big ticket items every single time.
---
So yes wouldn't surprise me if these were all scams as well.
---
I’ve disliked Braham for so long but him drunkenly blabbering to you during this prologue changed that so fast. And I normally can’t stand drunk folks. Poor guy is just trying to find his place in the world!
---
No the untargetable frame works so that when the projectile hits you it gets destroyed. Like when a mesmer with distortion jumps inside Sloth during his shake. The mesmer would get hit by every projectile from the shake (because he is right in the spawn of it) but the invulnerability destroys the projectiles so noone gets hit. 
---
What OP discovered is that the red orb can goe through projectile destruction skills and after that you cant destroy it anymore.
---
I only have 5, and i never see them... hm. I may have to take a look when I get home. I need more now that i have tomes for s3 s4 and “s5” taking up alot.
---
I miss the time when it could simply be reflected without any "using in-game skills for intended purposes would make life too easy" shenanigans :(
---
For now I try to spam aegis more, as that's what hypernova launch is giving in the first place (plus if something still screws up one or two orbs there's at least a chance to react )
---
Just add hard mode zones, like in GW1.
---
I'm still salty about the Cursed Shore nerf :(.
---
It make their accounts seem more legitimate when they use it to influence elections.
---
Might also be cool to do a battle of the bands style thing, bring in more groups from the other races of Tyria.
---
Woop! Great job as always! :D
---
He claims he's been given CESs as donations. Also possible he purchased them without a post on the exchange, he seems to be friends with some of the "TP Barons" (and could potentially be one himself)
---
Seems a bit odd that people are instantly going with the "he's doing something illicit" assumption in the same week that WP does a video with people who have more in-game resources than any of us can possibly begin to fathom. Who's to say he hasn't acquired this massive wealth over years of playing the game and is now using it to further his channel instead of sitting on it?
---
THIS IS A MOTHERLODE!
---
What if I have requests? Can I ask? This is freaking cool.
---
I wasn’t saying I thought he was making even a significant portion of it in game.  I honestly suspect majority of it is cash &amp; donations *if* these things are actually being given away
---
4 are used for the Ash legion hideout
---
 What about the rest?
---
He was explaining how he won a giveaway and offered a screenshot showing that he won. I'm noticing a couple other comments along those lines being removed. Obviously I can only guess why but I've got my tinfoil ready just in case.
---
fun fact, i've had my suspicions for a while, i never watch WP's videos, its 100% coincidence that this thread falls within the same timeframe of that video, i didn't even know he made one about this recently. believe it or not....
---
You probably need to have completed the puzzle for the first time before you can do that. I tried to do that at patch launch and it kept booting me out.
---
Yeah I know, I was talking more about organized play like raids or wvw. If you split little shades you can be both ranged and melee at the same time just takes a bit more coordination and prediction. 
---
In the end it's more of a nerf to ease of use and is more to increase the skill cap of scourge while also raising the skill floor needed to be successful with it.  
---
You'll be more rewarded for accurately predicting movement of enemies (atleast with better cleave) and punished harder if you place your shades in poor areas with a reduction in survivability and damage.
---
Maybe. But I hadn't completed that map nor did the puzzle with that character yet. Only had the PoI on another character.
---
take improvisation over executioner in deadly arts traitline. op used it in the run and guess he missed it when making the build in the editor
---
Gat dangit. I just bought some shared slots last night.
---
I'm willing to believe OPs because as a general rule, posters don't check past posts (no offense). It's the rest of the people here that I'm mostly referring to. Coming up with wild accusations and crazy theories when the simplest explanation is almost certainly the correct one.
---
Wiki does.
---
Still waiting on my banner healing skill
---
Oh trust me, I absolutely knew what you meant. Its why I pointed out I didn't JUST mean like 'you specifically.' And I edited the strikethrough, apologies for that, haha!
---
My point comes down to the phrasing of it. I've done harder-core raiding in FFXIV, so like, the Savage and Ultimate difficulties, as well as the easier Extreme ones, and I've been both the underperforming player AND the one who had to tell someone that their damage/mechs/etc were just not quite up to snuff atm. There's a big difference in 'you're shit get out' and 'It seems you're not quite performing at the level we need rn, I'd recommend some practice on xyz before you come in again' etc? It's all in the phrasing, and very rarely do I see pugs really consider that. Maybe I've just met some very harassment-eager folks in pugs, who knows. I'm certainly not suggesting 'never kick anyone' nor 'never tell someone that they are performing their role in the raid poorly/need more work' cuz my god, trying to farm a trial for the mount in ffxiv...get that One Ninja pulling half the dps he should be in his gear, making the fight take two minutes longer....get that one tank who REFUSES to do the swap properly cuz 'insert popular raider here' said that it's better for dps to not...? That's something I'd rather not suffer through, either. It's all in your phrasing at the end of the day.
---
common no TP Baron is popping 100k-200k a month without something shady going on...
---
Where’s the fun in that?
---
ppl exposing themselves? i mean they didn't even get hate or anything, no point in removing those comments, but whatever, not my cup of tea
---
it changes everyday
---
Probably account bound. I tried teleport to friend on day 1 but it kicked me out immediately (although i did unlock PoI). I have since done the puzzle legit and I tried teleport to friend again yesterday and was able to stay in without issue.
---
That's a microphone? I thought it was a crack pipe
---
I’m ok funding the game just damn that timing
---
Cute symbols :).
---
Yes it’s PvE balance, and wow that build sounds super fun, I‘ll put that on my list thx!
---
And gw2 endgame gring is easy, unless you are going for your first ascended gear
---
Cex-a-beret?
---
Yes please.
---
even if a real person might get something here and there, that doesn't mean that all 100 % of the stuff goes to real ones
---
Wrong, you clean it off with the rest of your enemies.
---
How are we supposed to efficiently farm the map currency now tho?
---
Do not stop there! Not only every core skill set should be completed with elite and healing skills. The types themselves should be complete fully: 1 healing, 4 utility, 1 elite:  
---
* Revenants should have a 4th utility for each legend, so two revenants with the same legends can have at least some different utility skills.
---
* Core engineers have 4 skills types with 5 utility skills each. To match the 5 types with 4 utility skills per type the other professions have, the least useful and popular skill of each type should be reworked into a 5th type. For example, Traps, or even better, Preparations: 
---
 * Gadgets: Throw Mine is the easiest choice, as it behaves like a trap already, but enemies can see it. 
---
      * (Prepare) Explosive Charge.  
---
Same effects as mine, but working as a preparation and invisible to enemies once set. Damages and removes boons, and it's an explosion.  
---
 * Turret: No need to stop to think, the most useless as a turret is the Net Turret. It would be changed to work on demand:
---
      * (Prepare) Ensnaring Net  
---
Same effects as Electrified Net (Overcharge of Net Turrent). Stuns and immobilizes enemies. 
---
 * Elixirs: These are the hardest to choose since they are all nice to have as elixirs. I'd go with Elixir B since it's the most generic of them, with just boons. 
---
      * (Prepare) Boosting Charge  
---
Same effects as Elixir B, but affecting 5 allies instead just self. 
---
 * Kit: Kits have 5 skills, so this one would require additional changes, shuffling skills around and adding a new weapon for core engineer. I'll go with Toolkit for this one.
---
      * (Prepare) Box of Nails. Same effects as box of nails, but now it pulses 5 times, has more stacks of bleeding, and also causes torment. 
---
      * Mace. The remaining skills will be moved to a new Mace weapon for core engineer. 
---
            * Smack&gt;Wack&gt;Thwack. All 3 will deal more damage, and Thwack will also deal vulnerability. 
---
            * Magnet&gt; Pry Bar. If an enemy is pulled by Magnet, it will flip over to Pry Bar. Pry Bar Will deal Daze and confusion, double confusion if the enemy was interrupted by the skill. 
---
            * Gear Shield&gt; Works like the . 
---
            * The skills may have to be renamed and the animations reworked to work with Mace. Down the line they could be changed further, like making Gear Shield give 1s retaliation when blocking attacks, up to 6s.
---
 * Toolbelt skills would be the same ones the original skills already have, to make things easier. 
---
And then we'll finally have full skill sets for all professions. 1 healing, 4 utility, 1 elite for each one.
---
If you have enough liquid assets to purchase a ces chances are you have quite a few high profile connections.
---
Also how would he even get so many items, even if you include all ingame and outgame trades that can hardly explain the supply he claims to give to other people...
---
Very interesting thanks much for the mechanics reply sir. Feels like an inconsistency from sphagetti code in that case IMHP
---
Sounds like Cellofag giveaway :LUL:
---
i try to but it always catches the screen and not the glitch
---
How I feel,  max magic find still can't find anything.  The RNG gods have abandoned us.   Should have helped the elder dragons destroy tyria.
---
Had you already done the puzzle previously? And was it in the same reset window or a previous day?
---
alright i'll try that. Thanks for the help
---
Could you please do Kira from JoJo DiU, You could use Zhaitan reach as his weapon because he loves hands but idk what armor pieces would match his suit
---
oooh win10 update, so that's why.
---
Just because all the people who tune in or follow or subscribe for the giveaway won't stay doesn't mean that it's not still worth doing. It's about getting people to notice that you exist, check you out, and then if even ONE person likes it enough to hang around, you've gained a viewer. That's worth it for some people.
---
People who do these giveaways know very well what they're doing, just like stores know exactly what they're doing when they have sales and promotions. It's just a form of luring in potential customers.
---
Dude you should watch the video linked up. The guy in the video *did gained all back*.
---
I do hero points for verdant and auric every day and it honestly shocked me when I started doing the crystal desert ones. With practice it took me weeks to learn how to solo those 2 HoT areas and my solo win percentage is still about 75%. The desert is so brain dead I barely have to try.
---
Ah. Ty. Thought it was set
---
Interesting, so soon after the sale.  Bought all I needed during the sale, but huzzah for anyone who didn't.
---
Dem gold to gem ratios tho
---
ball pit?
---
He frequently shows videos where he has tens of thousands of liquid gold, but that's not a good indicator. As the guys in the WP video pointed out, liquid gold has little value at the upper echelons of play. The TP takes too much money, so they instead barter items instead of money directly. It's not unlikely that his wealth is predominately in those items. He never showed his TP or collections tab in the video and he could have very easily had items stashed on characters he wasn't showing.
---
its worth doing until anet realizes it's rmt and bans every single one of them.
---
People who do this in games have no idea what they're doing, they're just lucky idiots to get away with this sort of stuff.
---
Race doesn't matter for end game content, as the only combat differences come from the racial skills which are universally garbage. 
---
Race will however effect your personal story so choose whichever race you would like to learn a bit more about.
---
Class is up to you. All classes fill their own end game roles and none of them will completely hang you out to dry. All classes are very fun to play. Some classes are easier and more beginner friendly. Notably necro and warrior are very easy to get the hang of. Ultimately choose a class based on what is most interesting for you. I will however urge you not to start with Mesmer right off the bat. I have heard many stories of that class being very confusing for a complete beginner. Great for a second character though!
---
Put the most important part in bold for you because apparently I literally have to spell it out for you.
---
When did I say they never addressed sand savant? Everything you're describing are things scourges already did (barrier on pushes when needed,10 target aoe ect) i'm not sure why you're acting like this is some new gameplay from scourge when its the same stuff scourges have been doing for the last 2 years just a bit stronger now but with more room for error. **You realise that i'm literally agreeing with you about it being buffed and them not addressing the problem right? That it is an overall buff to scourge? Why are you trying to argue when we agree that it is a buff? Realise this please so you can stop being so defensive for absolutely no reason about the things we agree about.** The only thing that people should be aware of is you should use f3 for bombing and not just to apply barrier (many cases you should be able to use it for both anyway) by judging the situation you're in at the time just like you should be doing on scourge right now and reacting accordingly.
---
I would go with a staff:
---
* Staff of Command.
---
 * Direct your staff of command to pressure your enemies and spur your allies for each enemy hit. Finishes downed enemies. 
---
 * Casting ½s,  Recharge 10s
---
 * Damage: About 150% the damage of Holy Strike. 
---
 * Might per enemy hit: 3x8s.
---
 * Fury per enemy hit: 4s.
---
 * Alacrity per enemy hit: 3s
---
 * Slow per enemy hit: 2s.
---
 * Casts: 2
---
 * Count recharge: 45s.
---
 * Radius: 360
---
 * Finisher radius: 180
---
 * Range: 900
---
meh, not a big fan of it.
---
2-5 minutes per ss? what?
---
you could do like 15-20 forges per minute, even faster with macro
---
Did you miss the part where I said using real cash + donations?  I was not trying to imply they were generating the wealth themselves.  Given the two comments I suppose I need to reword my comment.
---
yea you might be right, but the video didn't leave that impression, and also wouldn't someone who's so fixated on views show off their wealth? I mean they're doing it now, why not back then? would be a pretty hefty clickbait if they had multiple chars full of legendaries and infusions, wouldn't it. But yea I get your Point.
---

I'm a simple Gaymer. I always pick big jugs.
---
That's a vital information. It means that there is no problem with rendering but with everything that happens after. Check your monitor cable, synchronisation and display frequency. Turn of v synch.
---
I thought you were talking about the little JP chest and the reward ones my bad.
---
So I just tested while deactivating Auto loot, and the big chests seem to have minimal loot, most of it comes from the bouncy chests. So I wouldn't be surprised if the chair/weapons came from that too.
---
Nah, they only play bluegrass.
---
I am 100% sure it works with block. The reason it doesn't work with aegis is that when the boss does the red orbs attack, he also delivers a knockback shockwave that will usually strip your aegis before the red orb will hit you.
---
Tfw you didn't put the dyes
---
What's the open world cap?
---
If he isn't following his own guides then it would imply he dosent have enough confidance in them.
---
If you had a chef create a meal, then refuse to eat it themselves it wouldn't inspire much confidence in said chef. It probally has a pile of bloodstone in it
---
Been like that since i started doing CM's as far as i remember but yeah
---
Upvote for gothic
---
The guy you're talking about is well known among the TP barons.  Its come to most of our conclusions that he uses Patreon money, donations, and normal TP flipping to obtain the giveaway prizes.
---
It doesn't look like a scam at this point but there's no way to really tell unless you play with the people who are indeed winning.  Looking at their AP, play time, and all the stuff that makes a person look like a legit player.
---
Ninetales and pikachu made me laugh out loud in a barbershop LOL don’t know what I expected
---
They dont refund your money, just the gems difference between sale price and normal price
---
wen dye?
---
if someone reaches the arena you there will be a teleport available on the minimap, the same ones you see in Dragonfall map.
---
Still bothers me to see the Elementalist's Ether Renewal to have a TWO AND THREE QUARTER SECOND cast time for a heal skill with condi clear while Deadeye gets Malicious Restoration in 3/4 second AND dumps those same condis on their enemy AND heals for 2k more than the full ele channel.
---
Skill types or not, some skills just need reworking. Make Ether Renewal only 3 stages ffs.
---
Devil’s advocate - wouldn’t that make every class too similar? WoW tried that and the PvP playerbase fell off of the map. EVERY class had stuns, heals, and insane mobility. It entirely removed class identity.
---
I copy pasta'd that off their site.. It is a redundancy. I'll let them know to fix it. Thanks!
---
Haha I laughed at this yesterday. It’s great. 😂
---
No characters from jojos? Very nice

---
I hope they keep volatile. It will keep the season 4 maps slightly more relevant.
---
Mesmer is probably easier to play than Elementalist, but that doesn't mean it "does everything else better".  And DPS, which you say Elementalist is better at, is generally the most important thing in the game.
---
But beyond that, there are frequent balance patches that can often shake up the established meta, moving some classes up and some classes down.  Picking a class specifically because it's good at this moment in time can backfire on you when in a month, or six months, or a year, suddenly it's not as good anymore.  Picking a class because you enjoy its playstyle, though, that can carry you forever, through nerfs and through buffs alike.
---
Well the defense line pretty much plays half the game for you so not much to worry about in 1v1s
---
I am hard stuck on the course in Jornar's pass, any tips?
---
You haven't done any strike missions so far have you?
---
You don't want to know.
---
Just bought the full pack two weeks. Been playin everyday. Still a very active community and super helpful!

2 groups shade bomb each other, one using f3 for barrier and one using it for damage. The group using it for barrier soaks up more damage than the group using it for damage deals. 1.5k vs 1.7k. This scales with protection and great dwarf. The group with barrier keeps scholar runes active for longer. The group with barrier deals more damage on each tick of f5, survives better, cleanses more conditions, and gains more might. Is that spelling it out enough or...?
---
say it again, why'all! karma, huh! (good god) what is it good for..absolutely nothing~!
---
Haha, same! Didn't expected that one!
---
Yeah, don't mind him he's high. This was a PvE change made to punish a braindead holo build but they forgot to add in the buffs to the non-braindead builds so it's just shittier overall.
---
That moment when you bought a bag slot 5 hours ago

(necromancer laughing)
---
&gt; llusions power chrono, for example, is a DPS class that has projectile absorption build into its rotation that it can't help outside of outright not swapping to focus at all at a significant detriment to their DPS.
---
I kinda look at it like any other skill you want to use at a specific time, like stability or cc or using your special action to not get hit by certain skills. You know using a skill during a certain time frame is "bad" so play around that and either cast it earlier or later so you dont screw yourself and/or your teammates over. 
---
&gt;In the past, I am 100% sure that stuff like spellbreaker elite worked for absorbing the orbs.
---
So when I first learned 100cm (months before the april update) the group I got my first clear with spent 2hours on arkk. I on my spellbreaker was using the elite to cheese the orbs (just like I did on regular 100) and it never once worked for 100cm. Once I figured out the orbs gave no fucks about winds of disenchantment I changed my play style and stopped using it there. I have since looked at all projectile destruction/reflection on arkk the same way ie the red orbs give no fucks about them (but i havnt tested everything). I dont know why we have different experiences here.
---
I wrote them off too, to be honest, but after the holo fuck-up and Wooden Potato's open world build video, I've been enjoying it a LOT. Return of the Gyro Juggernaut from the HoT days. Not Raid Meta or whatever, but still fun to play.
---
Okay I've got one more. "Scar" from The Lion King but it's literally just Bangar.
---
Elementalist is one of the last classes I learned to play at a semi-decent level.  It's very squishy and requires a near perfect level of mastery dodging and avoiding damage.  You can take some evade-frame skills like "Twist of Fate" (Weaver) or Arcane Shield (Arcane/Base Ele) but a lot of it is learning immaculate positioning and learning what skills to take into what battles.
---
Or you know you could just go to the maps.
---
Dude no one is using chem field. The asuran racial utility gives it a run for its money in terms of DPS. It's a fucking shit skill, it looks like a 2012 garbage skill. And reveal is useful in two out of three gamemodes. You're angry because ANet hasn't given engineers the damage they need to be competitive. Don't pretend that chem field is your magic bullet.
---
Whose the second guy he's talking about? fusedflame?

This is not how Strike mission matchmaking work. Try it out first, then start complaining.

I don't.  Most of my playtime is with a single friend, and we hate butting up against group-dependent content as part of map progression and character building.  There are just soooo many super-difficult champion HP's in Heart of Thorns. :\\
---
See, your raider elitist is already showing up. You just dragged me through mud like I am 60 iq idiot that refuses to do anything. Which in actuality I'm pretty decent player if I can say so myself. I did the Strike 4 times, one of which I was the only one alive doing the carry with my 14k Zerker build Sword/dagger Weaver Ele. To be honest I probably would learn all raids after first run. I don't do them because of social aspect, I'm not that good with people and don't like talking with them, also my accent probably sucks a lot because I don't really have the opportunity to hone it. Also perhaps it's my server but I never, ever saw a guild add that would say they don't require a active voice comm on raids.  Not gonna lie you surprised me with that exotic gear, I tried doing raids 3 times and fully ascended gear was asked every time.
---
ANet said that Stikes can be a stepping stone towards the raids but that it's also an activity without the raids stress.
---
You say I'm stubborn and that I want strikes to be only an activity for casuals, but could you please tell me why you and every other raider I talked with refuses to have "baby mote" for the actual raides? Please hear me out:
---
Have the raids exactly the same, wipe mechanics stay so that new players can learn it, just nerf the dps done to players and hp of bosses so the encounters are easier overall. 
---
For rewards at first I was like "no rewards, it's simply a mode/mote to learn raiding" but then I thought about something, what if the baby raides would give new currency and have a new vendor that sells ascended gear? armor, weapons, trinkets, infusions, food etc. 
---
With that, new players could learn the actual raides and work towards better gear that they could use on the raids.
---
Whats so bad about the idea that you and so many raiders just disregards? I truly don't understand.
---
Also I don't think that making the strikes harder is a bad idea, I just fear that you hungry for hardcore, challenging content players will want to turn it into your new raids, and the casual players \[which I guess I'm one of them in your eyes simply because I don't raid\] will be left with nothing. If there will be tiers added what will happen to the exclusive items? Will these no longer drop on T1 as it is now? Right now causal can farm stikes to get that shoulder skin and new chair, I just fear that after tiers would be introduced exclusive items would be moved to higher tiers.. I don't know, like I said I wish for an actual baby mote for the actual raids and I'm okay with making strikes harder but not too hard. Something that your "every sunday" player might find challenging and will try to master in weeks/months but advanced players and raiders will have no problems with.
---
It's not like I haven't researched anything before making this thread, I've seen their videos, and I've came to the conclusion that something is fishy, I'd happily be schooled otherwise, thats why I've started this discussion. And yea I could've asked them myself. But this isn't all about it being a scam or not, it's also about the question of Patreon giveaways being RMT or not, and I'm honestly more interested in y'alls opinions rather than theirs, since their opinion is obviously that it is okay to offer ingame goods for patreon money.

The tall forest area of this zone always stood out to me for some reason so thought it would be neat to see them side by side

You only need to buy PoF and unlock HoT automatically with it, keep that in mind.

Doing skyscale collection during this record was such a cocktease.
---
I did it accidentally. Tried to mount up in shallow water.
---
yea maybe not such a big mystery after all.
---
250 years later, boy. Just imagine how much Tyria will change in Guild Wars 3, if it ever happens
---
Exactly my thoughts. I've got multiple characters rocking that sick, sick snowfall. An 'upgrade' that removes that ability would very much not be desired.
---
You realize that you can't join a strike in progress, right? The second someone starts the first event of the strike (the rolling snowball gauntlet), the instance locks down so no one else can join.
---
Rytlock doesn't even have a unique face, does he? I'm pretty sure one of the selectable faces is either the same as his, or at least extremely similar.
---
Either way, I agree -- I would *love* to have new faces and hairstyles in the makeover kit soon. Bangar's face included (but also some new hairstyles for male asura, and some male asura faces that don't look like either overly cutesy and/or psychotic would be nice, too).
---
I love the Dante one but what class can use pistols and great swords?
---
It's the marshmallow experiment in action! I do this too. 😂
---
They need to go to Black Citedal
---
That's the point.
---
Barely use Skyscale, Springer is faster in most situations.

Only use it when I need to go diagonally upwards with the two barrel rolls instead of just straight up.

But i just bought one :(

So you're the bastard that undercut me on Charles the Hellfire Skeleton

I have never understood people's obsessions that the dragons get personalities. The \*point\* of the story is that they don't have personalities, they're fucking incomprehensible facets of the universe. It's like getting mad that a tornado doesn't have a personality ("You know, I don't like that my house has been destroyed, but the LEAST the tornado could have done was explain its reasoning"). Furthermore, they're objective isn't destruction, it's the consumption of magic. Guild Wars 2 is a story about the hubris of the races of Tyria who think they are in control of magic but know nothing about how the world truly works and get corrupted or consumed by it. The Gods thought that Orr was a natural font of magic-- it was Zhaitan, the Asura thought the Central Transfer Chamber was a natural source of arcane energies-- it was Primordus, Svanir thought he had found the ultimate spirit-- it was Jormag, etc. The "personality" of the dragons doesn't fucking matter, it's the personality of the people who, ignorantly, go LOOKING for the dragons. It is the greed and power-hungriness of the races that has ALWAYS been the focal point of the story. Bangar is just the most recent power-hungry creature to look into the abyss.
---
I agree with you about Joko. My tinfoil hat theory is that Bangar is the writers getting a Joko character back because they, for some reason, wrote Joko into PoF and Season 4 without properly understanding the character (source being JP, but it checks out. Kourna is the only time Joko starts to sound like Joko). So the writers brought in Bangar to fill the same slot. I would NOT hold out hope for him for next episode, though. I think he's going to go up to Jormag and wake it up threatening it with the bow thinking it would fear it only for Jormag to freeze and shatter him mid-speech. Then Jormag turns to us and we have the whole speech from the trailer. But the writers said we're getting a turn to Lovecraftian horror pretty quick in Episode 1 and Bangar had a mission. So I think he's either corrupted or killed pretty fast.
---
That's not a good analogy. It's like Gordon Ramsey showing you how to make a simple meal for beginners, you think he's going to eat a simple baked chicken on the regular? No, he's far above you in skill, and uses recipes you don't have the ability to make, yet.
---
His guides are for beginners, not for barons.
---
told you - we tp barons make everyon  else misserable, we steal money and so on... so you have all the rights to hate us, ruining your game!
---
If we are talking about the same guy I can tell you that Ive traded with him via gw2exchange a few times and he pays better than most people in this subreddit.
---
I want my nightfury as infusion too. As an ouffit user it sucks not having it :(
---
First one looks sooo much better. The gw1 lighting effects and color schemes are so easy on the eye while gw2 looks loversaturated, also less tress so mounts don't get stuck.
---
if we can have a bunch of flying chicken for a glider ... why not this?
---
Not all skill types are created equal
---
Like it works for skins.
---
You equip an agony infusion item, then you go to the wardrobe and pick which skin you want for it.
---
 It’s quite funny when the gw1 screen shot looks better.
---
Joke about the Fyre Festival. Someone tried to put on a music festival where rich kids and social media influencers would spend thousands of dollars for the privilege of attending. It was an utter disaster. One of the few things people could do was spend a few minutes in a ball pit, a play area filled with plastic balls.
---
This is really interesting. How well does the prologue do in terms of not confusing you? That's not something I think a lot of veterans have experience with or consider in a patch.

Going up 'tall stairs' where the jumps are safe and the path up is long.

Perfect timing, I was just about to do this.

May I include it in the next build?

This is awesome! I think I'll steal some of these :D

I'm not sure if I overlooked it but I didn't see a Wonder Woman cosplay. May I contribute mine? I've been wearing it ever since I first saw the movie when it came out.

\+1 for longbow firebrand, I was just wishing for that yesterday
---
How would that work for dungeons when you have mobs and events on every step?
---
that's one of the hardest ones in the game. You need to be good at drifting, and there are a few locations where you need to drift. But it's also good to figure out when you can get away with not drifting. There is a location at the very end, right before the bridge, where you pick up a boost and then have a bend into the bridge. You should have enough speed before grabbing the boost already. Save the boost, and go immediately in a drift through the 3 rings and then boost out of it into the bridge.
---
darn it! You saw through my clever disguise! Yeah, it's me, and undercover MM *wink wink/ nudge nudge*
---
My reading comprehension? You called BS on the whole theme of the interview, after 30 mins and suddenly, you discover the plot, the MEME CONSPIRACY! (read MEME backwards, yeah, mind=blown)
---
What goes around comes around "buddy", you're making up some half-arsed assumptions, and that really grinds my gears - if you want to debate the morality, the material prices or the trading methods that are used - be my guest, but only after you actually do your homework on the subject matter at hand. But I know you haven't and I know you won't - players like you live in their own little world where they know everything about everything and they never even had to read a book to that end...
---
FYI calling me "the target market" is just about the only clear thing about your whole drama queen post.
---
I did try it, wont make dungeon grouping any better even if the instance gets locked as soon as you choose the path or kill a mini boss.
---
gw1 was about artistic composition while gw2 is more about filling the map with random stuff
---
Yes, it gives 5 I believe without checking.
---
Certainly
---
I did. Read my other comments.
---
Or eating them.
---
The thing about group content is that its not just you. If you like playing a certain build, great, everyone knows GW2 has plenty of solo content. However, when you do stuff like raids, youre gameplay doesnt just affect you anymore, its now 9 other players that are impacted. Now, if youre running in a friend guild or something, they might not care. But, if youre running in LFG, then its reasonable for those players to not want to carry someone. Running a non-optimal build may be fun, but realistically, it means you need to be carried because it just wont pull good DPS, or provide good/needed boons, or provide the right healing. 
---
Think about it in a different game-type context, like DoTA. You can play however you like, but if you play a carry DPS like a support, most times youre just a weight on your team that they have to overcome, and its kind of a dick move when you make it hard on 4 other people just because the 1 person wants something less than correct.
---
Thought the same thing after I made the comparison and looked at the thumbnail lol
---
A fair point. Seems my reference for it was someone stealing it from DashCon/Tumbl-Con and making it look like it appeared at FyreCon. Everything the Ball Pit touches turns to failure.
---
And in this map’s case... half of that random stuff isn’t even loading properly haha
---
Well, if Strike mechanics were applied to dungeons, I imagine it'd lock down the dungeon after the path choice is locked in.
---
In over 7 years I've only seen 1 precursor drop and it was from the first karka invasion event that gave lots of people precursors (so it obviously wasn't random). Which is too bad cause if more precursors dropped, there would be more reason to play.
---
Right, it's why I wrote similar and not the same. Similar only by how scummy it is.
---
As long as LFG is kept... I couldn't really care about them adding it or not tbh.
---
I know right? The design of the shoe surprisingly is really cool, I just can't bring myself to do the contest for a chance to win 1 of 16. If they were for sale i'd consider it.
---
AFAIK, you can just dodge the massive wave.
---
I use it when I gather around for a boss spawn because it looks derpy when you walk backwards, like a dog scooting his butt on the carpet.
---
There's a lot more to the crash log that would be useful to see - open it to show details and post that, but even then contacting support might get your farther than asking Reddit.
---
Save map's /ip when it gots stuck to see if it's event issue or map issue, then submit a bug report.
---
So what if they're not fully transparent? they still help people/give them tips, and give players different ways to make money (selling GoM and such), I just feel like many people are mad that other people are richer than them.
---
Mesmer mantras have gotten much better since the rework. The have an impact on channel and AoE effect when used. Not meta or anything like that, but it can weave in some decent support for large groups.
---
Just buy it
---
There's a lot of ways you could introduce dwarves as a playable race into the story. I'm not saying you should retcon everything, but we've seen it time and time again that Anet likes to change their old narrative sometimes to fit their current direction. 
---
There's the possibility of a previously unknown dwarven faction. There's a possibility Ogden lives up to his name and "heals the Stone" so to speak and reverts the rite. It's also possible the great dwarf somehow returns ( either the one of legend or the formed one still exists ) and gives life to new dwarves again. 
---
And just because there's probably only a few dwarves left, doesn't mean they're completely extinct. Or rather, we know they are a rare sight, and that they're near extinction. We don't have any numbers or insight into their current population though, so we can't say for sure how many there are still left. And just because there's few of a certain race, doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to play as one. As long as they're not a weak race or one with god like abilities, you can't really limit them. If canonically, only Ogden and Rhoban were left, I could see your point. But we don't know that.
---
The shoes aren't furry and don't have a tail in the back = no thanks
---
On the one hand, I am grateful Tyria has such staunch and powerful defenders as you and your friends.
---
On the other hand, what will we ever do when you decide to turn against us?
---
Look up Internet Historian's video on Dashcon
---
I feel like you've either got a keybind set weird, or you spilled coke on your keyboard.
---
Is their marketing guy from the 90's?? What's with all these behind the times stunts? What's next, action figures? Plastic weapons?    Official stickers?
---
That's the best part about any strategy involving portals: if your cooldown refreshes after you no longer need it, you can place a death portal after the fight is over, to troll your guildmates.
---
For example, on Qadim 1, at the very end of the fight after the JP phase, you fight Qadim on two separate platforms. If you place a portal on the first platform before moving to the second platform to finish the fight, and then complete the portal after the fight ends, anyone who takes it will fall through the floor to their death. The fight is already over at this point so it doesn't hurt anything, but it's hilarious.
---
With a gift of exploration valued at 500 gold, that's approximately  27 gold per hour (not counting any cost you incurred along the way).
---
which braindead build?, this isn't a thief discussion.
---
Unless you mean no-kits which is subpar but people champion it as the newbie friendly DPS wrecker.
---
Way too much color in the new one imo, but it's still somewhat good.
---
Might be a bit OP though, as specs are for better or worse designed and balanced around the weapons they introduce. A Mirage with shield would especially be overkill in terms of damage mitigation
---
I see springers used for easy break bar encounters like Vinetooth in Auric Basin.
---
Doing the mass bunny hop onto the Matriarch in Verdant Brink.
---
Yeah, I agree elite spec weapons should be usable by the core profession. Maybe even the slot skills as well.
---
To be fair, I also think elite specs should change the core mechanic far more than they do now.
---
what a smooth brain.
---
Except gw1 didn't have mounts.  Just saying.
---
The [meta banner build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/power%20banner/) already drops PP since it runs might signet instead. Even in fractals [dT takes might signet](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/power%20banner/) (though they take mending on fights with no phases to help with burst). If you're really trying to min/max you're swapping things around a lot but the longer fights gain more from might signet overall.
---
Why do cubs have fully developed horns? Just looks like a mini lmao

For a prologue, this is miles ahead of "normal episodes".
---
I've said it many times in the past, but I fervently believe expensive story instances are the Living World's cancer. GW2 sacrificed good storytelling just for cool scenes with no meaning or purpose.
---
&gt;Meta is just an illusion
---
Having success in shit conditions means nothing if the bar is relatively low to begin with.
---
But I hope you enjoyed your two hours fractal run.
---
I'm confused, you said the methods were shit and you couldn't be a baron doing them, but now you're saying someone did do them and is a baron

Explain

I can't wait to see the guy wearing these kicks with the Guild Wars 2 watch, driving down the street in their Guild Wars 2 VW Beetle.

---
I use it regularly when moving about. Skyscale is awesome but I absolutely love the springer. I'ts just so fun to bounce around on.
---
Yes
---
If disabling possible addons does not fix it, simply restart PC (not shutdown) to see if it helps. If not try repairing game (wiki has steps) and let us know how it goes.
---
I'm a manipulations kind of a guy. that's more my style of illusionary magic
---
I'd also really like to see an elite clone skill for mesmer. I can't imagine what it would even be like
---
In pvp that's maybe fine, but pve I'd very much prefer a one-and-done type deal. Cut the 8 pulses back to 3 or 4, and condi clear back to either 4 in 4 pulses, or on the strong end 6 in 3 pulses, so 2 per pulse. But when I want a heal I want a heal NOW and not over nearly three seconds while the enemy's still hitting me.
---
Now that Wash the Pain Away's been buffed with a single condi removed at the end of the cast, I've swapped to it and will never look back as long as the skill is in it's current state.
---
Oof gorgeous shots

Gw1 trees look way more organic than gw2 trees.. Kinda weird

The Tamagotchi (たまごっち) [tamaɡotꜜtɕi] is a handheld digital pet, created in Japan by Akihiro Yokoi of WiZ and Aki Maita of Bandai. It was released by Bandai on November 23, 1996 in Japan and May 1, 1997 in the rest of the world, quickly becoming one of the biggest toy fads of the 1990s and early 2000s. As of 2010, over 76 million Tamagotchis had been sold worldwide. As of 2017, over 82 million units have been sold.

What people seem to want is for ArenaNet to come out and officially say "What this guy is doing is 100% approved by us and completely ok," or "What he's doing is not ok, and we've banned him." At this point, we know the reddit community well enough to know what will happen if they make either statement.
---
ANet approves - Community says ANet condones RMT, or that ANet is turning a blind eye because he's shoveling money into their pockets, or something equally ridiculous.
---
ANet disapproves - Community asks why any giveaways are allowed at all, why they didn't act sooner, etc.
---
There is no winning here. But it's reddit, that's par for the course.
---
In most places they are the same, like the temple of time or the Balthazar one in ascalon the only one I can think of where it is not the same is the grenth statue in lornas pass
---
Im not totally against it but the idea of joining a dungeon(or strike for that matter) with 4 other players and not being a party kinda turns me off the idea. Like when you join a public strike as is you have no idea (at a glance) how many other people are there, what classes they are, what thier current hp is, boons they have, etc. Its a information black out concerning my teammates and that feels real bad for group content imo.
---
....but if you hung from it you'd be chopped to bits.
---
You may be mixing up the threads.
---
I never said they were shit, just that that if the person telling you to use the method then they are probably not good methods to begin with.
---
I meant it as in, more people would do dungeons since you don't have to wait like an idiot on LFG. You just click it, get a team and do it. Fast and easy.
---
&gt; And just because there's probably only a few dwarves left, doesn't mean they're completely extinct. Or rather, we know they are a rare sight, and that they're near extinction.
---
We've been told repeatedly that they've been wiped out and that is why the destroyers have breached the surface in small pockets in recent years. Edge of Destint was the first mention of shch and it hardened that point by showcasing a stone dwarf settlement overrun by destroyers.
---
The only underground dwarf that we've seen survive, did so as a head. And that was more luck than not.
---
There may be more "living" stone dwarves but they'd be like Rhodan. Isolated and incapable of hurling themselves into battle against destroyers. If they were whole, or mostly so, then the rite's alteration to the dwarges' minds would compel them to confront the destroyers. The only reason Ogden hasn't gone face first into a destroyer horde is because he keeps himself distanced and fulfills the compulsion by leading others into the hordes.
---
Our best chances at seeing a full stone dwarf would be in another Rata Novus research facility but one that hasn't died off.
---
Without retconning a few several dozen statements that is.
---
Besides all that, a playable race in general is simply excessively unlikely, and increasingly so as we progress further into the story. Besides all of which if we get a new race it'll be one that shares rigging and armor choices with another race to save time and cost. Stone dwarves' clothes are also stone.
---
And besides all of *that*, the entire purpose from a design perspective of turning dwarves into stone was to remove them forever from a list of potential playable races.

You don't have to hold your f3 to get barrier with the current way sand savant works, it currently applies every effect to 5 targets in the shade AND 5 targets around you.  With the new way sand savant works you apply the effects in EITHER 10 target around you OR 10 targets at the shade location. In the new system, if you use your f3 offensively you gain 0 barrier or any effects associated with it. If you use your f3 before f1, you gain BETTER defensive and BETTER offensive output with every shade bomb. The goal of the sand savant change is to decrease its effectiveness, this change will instead increase sand savant's effectiveness by 30% defensively and 50% offensively. The exact opposite of what they're trying to accomplish. Go read the patch notes again.
---
Instead of that you'd get in an empty instance and wait like an idiot in there. At least LFG lets you do something until people join the group. 
---
Groups would fill just as fast, you just save more time with lfg because you can do other stuff while waiting. There's literally no other difference. Posting a random lfg takes 5 seconds and if people dont join lfg now, what makes you think they'll join another system?
---
No. **Some** places they are the same. However most places are not such as ToA, Chantry of Secrets, several Orr statues
---
&gt; In pvp that's maybe fine,
---
Was fine. Years ago, like I said. Since then pvp evolved and skill did not. So the only time I ever used more or less recently it is when I played zerk weaver on Xera, as a panic button to survive long enough to give either healers time to react, people to pull/deal with adds. 
---
So anyway, as I see this skill, this isn't just "heal, clear conditions" thing, like dwarf heal or consume conditions. It is more of a "turtling" thing, that allows you to drastically increase you sustain when you anticipate shit to go down, at the cost of offensive capabilitites. Because of that, it really shouldn't get any shorter. To update it to current powercreep standarts you should instead either give stability or allow dodging while casting it, maybe apply damage resistance buff and clear more conditions power pulse in pvp/wvw. 
---
And iti s fine it you won't really wish to use it in pve, pve is usually about purely offensive stuff.
---
&gt; The \*point\* of the story is that they don't have personalities, they're fucking incomprehensible facets of the universe.  
---
Honestly, not really? People say this all the time, including Anet, but the story has never really framed the Elder Dragons as being incomprehensible or having no personalities or being so above our way of thought etc etc. They're forces of nature in the same way anything in the food chain is, but they still show personality and human characteristics. Zhaitan was cunning and was basically always plotting to take us out before we took him out. Mordremoth was literally shouting in our head to fuck with us. I honestly really like the us vs dragons storyline, and the fact that actively killing the dragons destabilizes the world is a kind of neat twist, but I can't help but roll my eyes when anet and everyone else try to frame it as something it's not. They really are just evil dragons that want to eat magic and kill anyone that get in their way. No amount of "Ah, but we really can't understand them, they're so vast and powerful" won't change that. 
---
And FWIW, I find the people citing those same talking points to criticize the dragons equally eye rolling worthy. It's like people are only looking at forum posts for the story.
---
I would go with a light field for guardian that grants aeagis to allies within and reduce the block duration a little bit.
---
It'd probably be an elite phantasm, since phantasm and clone are just a split of the "illusion" skill type.
---
Well... Thieves don't live forever and live and die on a mistake.
---
Berserker uses it to reset its burst skills, but that was created years after they added types to heal and elite skills.
---
A gadget elite skill for engie would be hella cool.
---
Any heal skill that grants boons is a good candidate for this.
---
Many also deal damage. 
---
Most classes have a least one of those.
---
Ha man, if I knew about that. I made some cosplay of [Final Fantasy : Brave Exvius](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9tcnum/ingame_gw2_cosplay_of_ffbe_character/) characters last Halloween.
---
Yeah, but really any PBM build. Holo is built around heat. So, thinking as a game designer, it's insane that the highest DPS build for that class is the one that's just "spam all the highest DPS forge skills until you explode".
---
The shitty balance is the fact that they didn't pair the overheat nerf with MASSIVE buffs to another grandmaster that would let you make up the DPS.
---
Or turning your entire kingdom into ghosts to make your invaders and people eternally suffer.
---
Higher up in one jump, fast and no clunky landing if you at some point get to high with the skyscale because of bad aim. When that happen i get annoyed and it takes several seconds longer and i would already been on the way with my springer.
---
Heh. I'll Griffon it.
---
Thanks! Most of the props go to Nico (Van Gherwen). He came up with the idea and then we optimized it with everybody.
---
How about next time you don't listen to the God of War telling you to commit mass genocide and steal the lands of the original inhabitants.
---
Come on what? I mean if you are happy with it and don't use the springer all is good right? Why do i have to feel the same way???
---
Up close the relatively low-res textures get more obvious, but for big shots like that it still looks great.
---
eye of the north did look good at the time. compared to it prophecies was butt ugly
---
k.
---
You’re probably right. I think the whole map may simply be upscaled since some aspects are too peculiarly similar.. but I won’t pretend to know their development process so who knows for sure lol
---
Some or all of the "wild" nodes also have visible devourer eggs. Plus a bunch have the actual devourer nests nearby.
---
So with map comp taking me \~18 hrs, add another 10 hrs for 2 Gifts of Battle -&gt; 35g/hr However, lets say I buy some rodgort precursors, already have the fungeon tokens and sell them at 1900g each turns into 135g/hr
---
Totally agree.
---
It's not balanced at all that my power scourge with all berserker except few celestial pieces can be so close in damage to eles/revs, while having 22k health + 8k barrier pre-applied before the fight for a total of 30k effective health pool.
---
It's just insane that Scourge has access to that on top of all the corrupts.
---
I see Cantha I upvote!
---
This is the appropriate response! I mean they HAVE to know that we’re absolutely gagging for it, right?
---
Ehhhh... It depends.
---
The on-launch difficulty was a mess. The maps were intended to be traversed in zergs, which actually is a riddiculous idea in the first place. Scheduled meta-events are fine, but gating exploration progress behind forcibly having to adapt your playtime schedule to fit in with events? No.
---
Also, most of the mobs have a fake difficulty. Being outnumbered by mobs that deal over 1/3 of HP damage per hit? Being permanently disabled because it so happens that mobs have more CC moves than the number of cleanses and evades you got?
---
I'm good with stuff being hard, not unfair.
---
Maybe one day:-P
---
Every darn day. My hope for Cantha burns ever-bright if speculation for the saga turns out to be true and Steve is finally revealed at some point. Fingers crossed!
---
I use it to break open a giant choya pinata and that is about it.
---
Most people raiding know what cc and breakbars are. This kind of coordination goes way beyond tutorials.
---
Had to do a double take. GW1 looks so much better.
---
Played since beta, only finished the vanilla and PoF stories lol
---
You can use the f3 before the shade when you need to be more defensive and you use it after the shade when you want more offence. If you're pushing with your shades you'll be hitting allies around the shade as well as enemies anyway so it would be better to use f3 after the shade in those cases depending on how quickly you push into them ofc. Its not always better to use it before you place the shade since not every scenario is the same, you act like every push is going to be 2 groups running at each other so you'll always need the barrier when that's not going to be the case at all as evidence by the video you yourself posted where you were stealthing out of structures and assjamming groups with a another tag which is what 90% of groups do in wvw now.
---
In some places gem cards might he cheaper (eg, Australia)
---
I felt like I was alone in not doing much for the stories haha. Nice to know others are out there!
---
You need to edit your post for Zelda. The first two are Zelda, the third one is Zelda's girlfriend.
---
&gt; and don't tell me about "TP Baron's" or whatever. 
---
Well, if you look at gw2efficiency, and if you look around and how rich some people are, there are quite a few people who do have that much money. It seems absolutely ridiculous to a "normal" player, but yes, there are these "barons" out there, and they do have that much money, and more. Whats on the TP hardly reflects on what is sitting in a few accounts.   
---
Teapot had more than double the amount the Tradingposts Mystic coins in his inventory before his Raid tournament.  
---
  
---
BTW: thats how wealth is distributed in the real world. too
---
Oh sorry misinterpreted you
---
idk how many times it happens but we just started the meta for doomlore shrine and shaman brightblaze is just standing at the table not walking.
---
Yeah, if we fight bubbles and it isn’t on the jade sea, Anet are dead to me. Dead!
---
I wish he mentioned all the NPC dialogue because they're a great touch.
---
The first 2 games are still very dear to my heart so i had to try :D. I did give milten and xardas a go, xardas face being pretty similar but armourwise they were lacking a bit unfortunatly.
---
Do you have a skyscale? Because that's all you need and literally any map that allows mounts, there is no invisible wall that can be made high enough to prevent you from going over it.
---
This reminds me of [Project Tyria](http://projecttyria.blogspot.com).
---
anet still hating on my necros?
---
I'll admit, I don't like them, but they're not objectively hideous like the vast majority of game related Nike shoes.
---
Whoa! Never heard of this before. That’s pretty dope. Already scrolling through haha
---
And someone pooped in the ball pit on top of everything no??
---
Not too bad. I think the gold is a bit too harsh though and the shoulders make any male character way too bulky (which is not your fault ofc). Other than that, definitely looks like an ebonhawke soldier! Maybe a bit more earthy tones like brown, grey or beige and it would be perfect!
---
For reference.

---
Self satisfaction.
---
I'm pretty sure those are all pictures of real-world places.
---
This is the whole reason that I hated the game. 
---
It's an otherwise good game, but I cant accept it as a successor to gw1.
---
Oh, sorry, maybe I was unclear. If you prefer your bunny, by all means, use it. I was addressing the argument that people use it because it's faster, because I simply don't think that that's true in any real gameplay scenario I've been in. 
---
I'm never one to argue against personal preference. You do you, mate.
---
If I'm at a wall and want to go up, and the path is clear, I'd race you on a springer any day.  I've been near a wall doing something, someone calls out a bounty or something in map and I don't need to travel so far, just jump up to the ledge it's on. That is faster on a springer.  Not to mention, if there are branches around, like many places in Dragonfall, there's zero changes of my springer sticking to them.
---
I agree in most climbs, I'd rather use my skyscale. But there are climbs I believe to be factually faster. Like using a beetle to get to the wall I want to go up vertically, would be faster to go beetle/springer than just skyscale or beetle skyscale. 
---
People are saying it's slower on a Skyscale and it's true for them and me as well. Not in general circumstances and not in every circumstance, but I can think of several where it's factually true. 
---
I still use my skyscale more. There are just some areas/jumps that Springer is better for me.
---
&gt; A Mirage with shield would especially be overkill in terms of damage mitigation
---
And yet, would likely slow their DPS. While in that shield block they likely could not dodge and activate IH.
---
Not in WvW. They are about to be one of 2 viable classes (the other being Friebrand to keep your Scourges alive).
---
I always feel like the better question is why use such a shitty bot ...
---
