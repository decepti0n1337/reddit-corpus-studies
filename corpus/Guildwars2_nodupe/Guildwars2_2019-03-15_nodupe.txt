So that's the 6th dragon, he was in plain sight all along. 
---
---
---
Weird they haven’t been added already, sad but not surprised.
---
Yes. Your goal as DH is to stack as many damage modifiers as you can, because they're multiplicative.
---
There are some really cool companies out there that allow you to make custom keyboards, or you can do it yourself if you have a way to laser-etch mechanical keys.  You need only provide a special file for it (varies by company) and they can make them for you.  This seems like a great father's day gift you could do for under $50 US.    
---
Just make sure to have the keys not super clicky, and, of course, adhere to gaming standards in regards to responsiveness and hitting many at the same time.  With how many USB ports machines have these days, you can leave them both plugged in and he would pull over this one just for GW2 and use the other for browsing, emails, etc.
---
But that's Twilight, not Dusk! :P
---
The g602 only has 6 buttons on the thumb area....
---
I have my thumb on that bottom row for utilities and dodge.  Works well.  You do not jump a lot in the game unless doing the JP because ground AoE's still hit you mid-jump.  Though, I have large enough hands (or a small enough keyboard?) to his the first four from Z-&gt; without moving my wrist or hand at all.  Might also help to be double-jointed :thinking:.
---
Nothing that doesn't involve having already messed up horribly like in the clip, unfortunately. I guess you can skip 1 deimos ward but the CD is too long.
---
Well done!
---
any good mouse for GW2? No need for coloured LEDs and tacky design, just a good functional mouse with multiple possible bindings to improve my experience playing the game. 
---
YOUR BLOOD WILL NOURISH MY HAMSTER
---
But th' oozes!
---
AFAIK it's unique to the spear's bubble effect and the other two underwater weapons didn't have effects that it could be done with.  As for the land weapons, their auras do bug sometimes too with mounts but IDK how to make it happen and stick anymore. :(
---
Darn. Well thanks!!
---
linking a huffpo article and there goes any semblance of credibility out the window
---
The corsair M95 is objectively the best mouse for mmo players.  
---
It's been discontinued tho, but you can find it refurbished on ebay because of its popularity.
---
What if... \*puts on tinfoil hat\* WE are the 6th dragon?
---
Is it bad that I have at least 1 of everything in that picture...lol Keep up the great work!
---
Noice, just bought them earlier today, no Glyphs but just being infinite tools helps a lot.
---

---
Now i need Shared Slots and one extra character slot ( to use my lvl 80 booster who's taking one shared), to have the ultimate comvenience, but only 1500 gold left hehe, have to see if i can afford it.
---
yup, they change the game big time.
---
gl on story 
---
You THINK, while I'm talking from my own experience. I was thinking the same, untill I've got a MMO mouse. There is no way back after you try it. 
---
Anyway, it is not necessary at all, just like any other QoL thing. It won't make you a better player, it is all about the comfort.
---
New Jersey, I'd guess
---
Yes. Having a mount helps world completing a huge way, no question. Definitely makes it faster.
---
Who did he do this to?
---
If you want the raptor to help speed-wise, you can just do Path of Fire first few missions with Rahim and his raptor stables. If you need the Springer to help you further, which is probably the most useful for getting up to high places without fuss (helps a lot), then spend a little bit of time in the desert maps until your raptor has the canyon jump ability, then you can unlock the Springer. I’d recommend grabbing those two and then returning to your normal storyline and waiting before doing any more desert stuff if you don’t want to be spoiled or simply prefer doing the story in order
---
If you think you're carrying every single match, you're delusional.
---
And even if you *were*... if the game mode is dull to you, or you don't feel it's competitive, then *stop playing it*. There is zero reason to AFK/Idle other than to ruin other peoples' gaming experience. You are a huge part of the problem. Get out.
---
Correct, but a lot of people don't understand about the 5-stack cap. Some believe that there's a 31-second cap on stealth and expect blasting the smoke field to get them more duration. Since nothing other than Aetheric Cloak gives a stack with more than 5 seconds of duration, I have no idea where that 31-second idea came from.
---
Soo you was not ready and not watching your surroundings...
---
It's true. Lowest common denominator insults always attack something that has nothing to do with someone's skill or lack thereof, or things that aren't even really an insult in the first place.
---
This one is even more special, because half the people using it don't even know what it means.
---
[removed]
---
would you prefer it from somewhere else? It's not the onion. :|
---
The day I finally solo'd the grub from 100-0 was my own personal legendary achievement.
---
I think it's high time we have a single update dedicated to Class reworks and introducing new weapon options to the Core class.
---
Some classes have such strangulated weapon choices or horrible kits that I don't even know if I should bother using a mainhand/offhand.
---
Isn't that because most owls don't eat their prey where they are caught, and instead take them back to a safer location? Thus all of the carcasses of their prey would be in one area, making it into a slaughterhouse.
---
The mounts eliminate the long and usually boring runs from point A to B. Was skeptical  at first - noI can't imagine playing without one... Mounts even made WvW  fun again.
---
Do they make one with buttons that actually fit the size of a man's hand? I am no giant or anything but I find clicking those thumb buttons very difficult. I always press 2 or 3 at the same time. I mean I don't need a mouse the size of a shoe box, but the buttons are always too small and too close for me to just press one of them. 
---
I'm the same. When I thought mine was dying I seriously considered what all I would do because I've been using it for ~10 years for all my gaming. The Tartarus v2 is the closest thing out there, but it's not quite the same and doesn't have the onboard memory so it's not plug-n-play if you use it on a different system.
---
Are you thinking of getting mounts for literally ONE last point? 
---
I think, don't do that. First, you can always 100% world completion without mounts or gliders. It only takes a bit more running and jumping.
---
Secondly, if you care about playing the story in order and no spoilers, the mount that helps you shortcut the most is the springer. People who are okay spoiling 1 mission in PoF for the raptor might be less okay with spoiling 1/3 of the PoF storyline. 
---
In the end, it's your choice, but be informed.
---
Oh dang. Feel like I should go pick one up just in case this one kicks the bucket.
---
Heh, interessting. You need to use +100 Precision food. xD
---
You can keybind specific mounts?
---
Unless they changed something (it's been a while since I was at this point), it's impossible to get the springer without having the raptor and one of its masteries. If you don't have that, you won't even be able to see the heart to work on getting the springer.
---
In general I agree with you - in fact I think 10 man boons are really unhealthy for the future of the game in terms of new espec design. Unfortunately that's the direction they're pushing though so it's easier to go with the flow than ask for them to hard backpedal.
---
Oh my goodness, these are beautiful!! ;;w;;
---
I am curious too considering they're glyph-less.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Anyone the can share some light?
---
If you were hated on HoD, I can only imagine how it would be in actual good server, hahaha ha. 
---
Which game mode?
---
By physical I'm assuming power builds? For fractals Soulbeast is a dps while Warrior is more of a support, whilst dps-ing on the side. 
---
Power Soulbeast has one of the best burst damage atm, making it perfect for fractals that favours short fights.  However, worth noting that new fractal instabilities are a bitch so it might be harder to execute your burst without proper support. 
---
Spellbreaker's main use is for Boon ripping. Without boon ripping, some instability combinations can be ridiculously lethal. Full Counter is very fun IMO. 
---
Core Warrior &gt; Spellbreaker when boon rip is not required. Better damage, massive breakbar damage and better party buffs. Part of this is because Core Warrior has 3 Adrenaline Bars whereas Spellbreaker only has 2. The more bars = the higher the damage modifiers. 
---
what are you worked up with? lol
---
there was no epeen in my comment, just stating a fact.
---
wow.. that's amazing
---
I play this sort of tempest in fractals (don't reply telling me to play a better build, I get that enough) and it is definitely hard to pick which traits are best when so much is mutually exclusive.  
---
I also am not entirely convinced all of the traits work how they say they work. I keep trying to check if aura-on-attunement-swap and aura-share-to-team actually work together, but I've never actually **seen** it happen.
---
Shouldn’t that be “similar, if not the same”?
---
I could be wrong but it sounds wrong the way originally written. 
---
Congrats on beating it!
---
You're actually just wrong
---
Does anyone have any suggestions for me on what to run to make some gold? I used to run istan daily but that was nerfed to the ground and SW is not something i like because i hate the thought/practice of having to have a character between level 49-53 just to open bags to make the most profit. I only really SW when i need MF for opening bags.
---
This post has a good overview: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8n2qqa/newreturning\_player\_resource\_3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8n2qqa/newreturning_player_resource_3/)
---
If you follow the personal story (which I enjoyed very much) you will get near level 80 by the end .  Living story is a good place to start new people.  Gliding requires the HoT expansion.  Mounts require the PoF.  Living story is alive and well, but you will have to purchase the older episodes -- they are only free if you login during the time they are the "new" story.  Do the 3 dailies each day to get the 2 gold.  I didn't bother to upgrade armor/weps while boosting to level 80 most of the time except by putting on better stuff as I looted it.  That was before the 2 gold per day, so it would be easy to upgrade every 10-or 15 levels if drops did not keep up with your increasing level.  Find a good guild and join it - you can have up to 5 - if it turns out that you don't like the people in it - quit and find others.  WvW and PvP modes are literally whole different worlds and not necessary to the beginning player - Good Luck!
---
I think a lot of people who say no are trolls or being sarcastic, rather than trying to earnestly provide an answer to a question.  There are some very salty people here, who have very specific needs or desires. They're into one aspect of the game, and they don't like the way that aspect has panned out.  For a guy like me, who plays everything, I'm pretty happy with the game. 
---
Not that it can't be improved, but that's true of every MMO on the planet.
---
All it usually takes for me to appreciate this game more is to go play other MMOS. 
---
Not what was meant.
---
There's too many at this point. All the player characters sound fantastic, Nolan North voices like half the cast and kills it every time, and everyone else is really great. I think the ones I like the least are the generic NPCs and anyone they recycle Taimi's VA onto because it just stands out too much.
---
I think the company as a whole has gotten so much better. Case in point when Demmi was brought back, her lines felt less stilted. I think some of that can just be attributed to the designers being able to trigger scenes easier/more fluidly, etc. but it also feels like they have a better idea of how to give VAs direction and clarify how they want a character to sound.
---
Top interaction is tought. For the heroes, Canach is probably pretty high up there or the Sylvari commander. For the villains, it's a tie between Balthazar and Joko. Balthazar's final fight is still an amazing soundscape with the lines tied to his animations perfectly and flowing smoothly. Joko's are great because of the crazy balance being struck between serious and silly. The Balthazar and Joko fights are easy highlights in any replaythroughs I do.
---
- World of Warcraft has shitty combat with great PvE, gear treadmill enforces way too much grind to be relevant. (Best GCD)
---
- Final Fantasy 14 has shitty combat with great PvE, gear treadmill but enforces irrelevant grind which wastes your time, quests are long-winded for no reason to kill your subscription time. (Worst GCD)
---
- Guild Wars 2 has fantastic fluid combat with good PvE (not exceptionally in-depth or challenging, no gear treadmill for investment). Is buy to play and free after that, all gem purchases can be made with a gold-&gt;gem conversion which means you are rewarded for time investment with cosmetics / QoL. 
---
- Black Desert Online is pay to win and you'll be spending a down-payment on a house to be relevant. Combat system is pretty cool but you can never make use of it because the Open world PvP is laggy as fuck and ruins your engagements. The PvE is grindy and repetitive, go watch a stream and 75% of their stream will be them running in circles killing respawning mobs for hours on end. YAWN.
---
Your only other *alternative* is ESO, but the combat looks trash and the lore is resident. It forces you to play an action combat system which limits FoV and movement. I haven't played, but it's enough to make me *not want to play*. 
---
Those are the only relevant titles for you rn. 
---
Infusing the backpiece might be really costly. I find it cheaper to just farm for the backpiece again and get another one. Just bring it up as a side discussion since your question has already been answered
---
[Someone on your team be like](https://elipunto.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/tumblr_mwhevrghlw1swdsh3o2_500.gif)
---
Yes, go for the free version first. You get almost all the content we had when the game first came out (you're limited on some stuff like trading, messaging but not in content).
---
Now don't be afraid if you find out that many areas are empty. This is due to most of the core maps being low-level. If you want to have an idea of the population you can look for World Bosses. They're on a timer rotation all around Tyria and you can easily find squads going to kill them.
---
staff auto isn't its main appeal. 2 combos into water(3,5) or ice(4) fields for healing or frost aura+ benefits. Its a rather nice package. that easily out-heals druid and allows for some stupid stuff on  sloth or in wvw. 
---
Water dagger 2 is such an awful heal. Like 1700 healing over 2.25s. I'm not using aura sharing water grandmaster as i mostly use tempest in 10 man content, so air dagger 3 isn't relevant. 
---
I tried and disliked ff 14. It doesn't fit every playstyle, at least, it didn't fit my playstyle. I'm not saying it's not a good game, but you don't really give a reason to try it, instead of Guild Wars 2. 
---
I like Guild Wars 2 because it's not a standard MMO. I prefer focus to be on the open world rather than instances. I don't like quest hub system while leveling. I don't like an end game that funnels me into raids.  And of course, Guild Wars 2 doesn't have a sub fee, which makes it appealing to some people.
---
I'm sure there are a lot of people who enjoy FF XIV and I'm sure it's a good game. But even though I can easily afford a subscription I couldn't get into it at all.
---
That Sylvari is the unspoken MVP of Dragon's stand IMO
---
There's tons of content for new players with plenty of variety, but it really slows down as you catch up to the current content. The only thing they update with any frequency is when they add a story chapter and a small map, every other activity doesn't get much content support. 
---
Which may be a good thing in your case, if you're afraid of getting sucked into a gaming hole.
---
IIRC there are whispers agents in Hoelbrak and you can interact with them if you are a Whispers agent as well and knowing the code they speak in "Kill the unkillable, Know the unknowable" or whatever. But yes they do seem to not have an open presence. I think thats because Norn seem to not like secrecy, more into glory, legends and taking battles head on, so they probably do not welcome spies and assassins.
---
im still surprised no newer model for the g600 has come out...guess MMOs not as hot theyre used to be...
---
Who knows, AMD drivers is full of surprises.
---
If you used old version of d912pxy, newer ones can help too.
---
logitech has the best wireless mouses if you wanna do a lil more research and dig into features he like =]
---
Yeah I get that too, but Owl didn't name the shrine. Norn did.
---
lol i quit pvp for a long time cuz of this. i'm the one who usually reported but nothing got done ya know. but i like the game mode, so have to bite the bullet and get back. it's sad but it's a struggle
---
No I don't. I also don't like the skills and wish the entire weapon for Ranger would get a rework.
---
I don't care what they do, I just want 18 inventory slots back on all of my different classes. That's the real annoying part. I have to dedicate a whole bag to prove I can kill a boss.
---
This is actually something a lot of players coming from other mmos struggle with at first. There is a ton to do, but the game doesn’t force any of it on you. You have to actively look for quests and events.    
---
Which is wonderful to me. I love just exploring and randomly stumbling upon some drunk Norn npc out for a fight and in over his head with a bunch of elemental imps, who you need to rescue and escort back to the lodge to sleep it off.
---
Prophecies (2005) music had some striking similarities with Oblivion's (2006) and Morrowind's (2002) in several tracks. Eye of the North (2007) music may have inspired some of Skyrim's (2011) and back to GW2 after.
---
I'm using heal tempest as an off healer along side a druid now that shout is applied to 10 men. It makes a very safe group heal for:
---
- VG (no green), druid takes tide/frost/sun
---
- Mathias, for blanket heal and condi cleanse 
---
- SH, same reason for boon spamming and cleanse. Druid is pusher.
---
- Dhuum, for 10 man cleanse, rebound for squishy DPS. Protection and rebound for 10% phase. Druid kiter brings spirits.
---
- Nikare, for when people struggle hard with his dash attack. 
---
If people worry about Fury, they could use Pack runes. Between Chrono's Pack rune, Tempest's Pack rune, Heat Sync, Sand squall and SoI, fury uptime is permanent without the need to go for fire trait line. I myself prefer Arcane for faster attunement swapping, more Healing Ripple procs and fast rez.
---
Yep, sadly I got 0. I have gotten two in my lifetime but 0 in the last year.
---
Rare weapons and armors, is it better to salvage or sell them on TP? Also I've been using mine in the mystic forge. What are the chances of getting a Precursor from this?
---
&gt; Final Fantasy 14 has shitty combat with great PvE
---
I played XI for years and I hoped XIV would be a magical game. I would love to have the combat system of GW2 in that game. I'm really surprised so many people love XIV when XI barely had a NA audience.
---
might need to get him a board with macro buttons for christmas
---
I always wonder about this kind of thing. Being that I've been playing gw2 for about 5 years. A friend got me into the game and after about a single day, dropped it to play other games- I stayed and fell in love instantly. I ask cause it's very probable I'm quite out of touch now being more experienced. Does the map pathing feel that un-intuitive?^((is that already a word?)) 
---
I found that the vastness of the zones lets you decide what you want to do (sometimes to a fault admittedly). I found that the lack of direction on where to go let you fully explore for yourself and felt more like a genuine immersive/ DIY experience. If a section of the map was too difficult, you'd find yourself running away from an angry enemy (which was kinda fun cause you could come back for revenge when you level up and were stronger hehe)
---
Same dude who plays Drevin, the blue haired elf that gets killed at the end of the tutorial in Dungeon Siege 2! Such an unmistakable voice.
---
Salvaging Rare give Ecto too, right? I don't remember.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Wait, Canach is Jake the Dog??
---
Subdue show off
---
He's my favorite succulent.
---
Pewpewpew is old but gold, however I would really like to hear it with realistic sounds in a video or something. Maybe I should do the video myself.. 
---
While he was with Annise he was noone. Now when he is free, he doesnt pay attention what he should be saying and what he shouldnt. That makes it so much fun. And what I noticed that always with explosives xD 
---
when they discover what causes the bug, they could probably cause it to happen on purpose and trigger it on an emote command 🤷‍♀️
---
If yu want a toss up between Gw2 and all the other thriving MMOs out there, I'll say give Gw2 a go.
---
Gw2 has one of the least restrictive F2P "demo" for any paid MMO out there. 
---
FFXIV limits yu to level 35 and just locks the game beyond that with a bunch of other restrictions.
---
TERA is just a grind fest then trying to figure out if yu wanna keep grinding.
---
Gw2 decides to give yu the entire core game free and all original core classes (or specs) free. 
---
Yu have at most, around 20 - 30hrs of content to go through FOR FREE.
---
Now if yu finally decide "I LOVE this game!" then buy Heart of Thorns or Path of Fire expansions which gives yu an additional class (The Revenant) and unlocks Elite specs. 
---
And this is a single time buy, and not Sub based like FFXV.
---
Now grind wise, it's almost non existent. There is no epic loot based on RNG. There is only dedicated non rng farming for gold and doing dailies to finally achieve an Ascended Set which is pretty much the best gear tier. 
---
Then after that it's all fun and games : 
---
- Map Metas with interesting mechanics that yu can do over and over without getting bored.
---
- Mastering Raids and Fractals, the endgame pve content.
---
- WvW for large scale fights and PvP for small scale fights.
---
- Tons of story and achivements to get through.
---
Not enough? Then drop some more money on Episodic Living Worlds which yu have missed and login regularly when a new episode drops to get the latest for free. 
---
Wanna support the game beyond just buying content? Drop money in Gemstore for fashion. 
---
That's not a real revive animation?
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

Wait, don't modern heal tempest builds use some form of main hand + warhorn? 
---
That's one hell of a welcoming community
---
Toxic af but you're an "known" community member so it's fine.
---
It's a classic. In intense fights or when I'm joking around I can't help myself but scream *fwew fwew fweeeeeeew* along with it sometimes.
---
Okay, I can accept that. But does celestial doesn't have to much stats witch are useless? Like healing, ferocity, precission? Those stats doesn't seem usefull for a build that is focussed more on conditions?
---
I see where you're coming from. I used to get discouraged about not seeing my weapons and armor- but most of the time in PVE at least, you're in zergs and/ or covered in visual clutter no matter your size/race! All you need to do is move yourself somewhere you can appreciate your character! I think we all do that from time to time no? Also, there is the embiggening tonic for that if you want to be noticed that badly! You become effectively the size of a human! I have the highest height slider on that toon in particular and sometimes get covered by other player's characters but I still think my weapons and armour is cool regardless! Maybe asura are not for you and that's fine! Greatswords on Asura show off exactly what you're talking about and I think is one of the best representations of a heavy weapon being wielded by a small character!
---
Tbh nowadays people lean more towards power than celestial scourge. Mix of marauders, cavs and zerk.
---
You beautiful nerd!
---
Eww, people actually use caps lock as a key bind? 
---
Longbow sounds are decent
---
But greatsword when it crits? It sounds like metal against hard metal, it’s so anticlimactic
---
so like the Aviator's Memory Box
---
I agree, it would be nice if the skills were cooler looking/sounding, and it would be REALLY nice if Longbow was actually good aside from being able to play like a scaredy.
---
Confirms my theory that the Commander is unknowingly an agent provocateur, sent in to destabilise nations and groups that are getting too powerful. At one point, you literally *beat workers in a mine*, and at another point you sneak into a bandit camp to poison their food. That's some shady, shady shit. 
---
The Pact at one stage offer the Commander a desk job, which they decline. The Pact see the Commander as a danger and want them out the way before any bad PR is linked back to them. 
---
I'm back to being confused T.T
---
He just tried to help you. Don't be an asshole. Seeing how you reply to others, you seem pretty arrogant. Maybe just stay in WoW?
---
Changed my keybinds long ago to 1-6 then QEZC, works well for me, never having to move my hand away from WASD :)
---
I've mapped F5 and my elite skill to the mouse, just Chrono things
---
I was with a condi fb last night too who doubled my damage, maybe it was you!?! Lol. Thanks for the advice! DH takes some getting used to being so squishy as well for me.
---
I get they tried to go with the magical feeling and what not but yeah...its bad haha.
---
Well for one you can convert it into bars to save space and use it. I'd honestly suggest holding on to them or converting them into [mithrillium](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lump_of_Mithrillium) to save or sell. If you ever go for a newer legendary they also take thousands of bars. You can always sell it if you want but you'll most likely need a lot of it later. 
---
Nobody ever has and nobody ever will remap jumping to any other key...
---
Didn’t think of this. Thank you so much.
---
You don't need a gear check to see someone with knights gear, though. That becomes painfully obvious when you see their dps output in arc.
---
Both games are based on global cooldown and you lose all fluidity. We're talking an absolute set time between one skill and 99% of your others (unless they are instant-cast panic buttons for defences). 
---
Your movement is your strategy, where your body positioning is key. There's no evasion, and the style is *outdated*. MMOs are implementing evade keys now to add more to strategy, where positioning AND evasion combined create more structured fights.
---
Essentially, you're very stiff and there's no fluid play. Press one button, wait 1.5-2.5s and cast another, even if you queue them. 
---
That's one example of the combat systems. FFXIV is worse in this regard.
---
As people have mentioned, people are leaning to pure power.
---
Celestial has it's merits of being an allrounder while still having damage through boon corruption even if facing those bunker comps.
---
From an avid PvP player, those binds are actually fantastic. Grats OP. Although if he's new, I think binding strafe left/right for Q/E helps a lot, also makes mount movement smoother. Also, you don't really need the Clear Target keybind. That's just my opinion.
---
Also, we rack up a fortune in Airship costs. Can't blame them for not wanting us to keep taking them to go on new adventures.
---
I switched from WASD to ESDF to gain a few more keys on the left.
---
Oh my god that's her voice in real life too? That surprised me.
---
It's less pronounced in pvp, so people still go condi there.
---
And yes, very much yes.
---
Of all power DPS, Scourge is the only one that can reliably bypass anti projectiles AND corrupt boons AND debilitate the enemy in Zergs.
---
Power built Desert Shroud does hurt quite abit and if yu gather a group of Scourges together to bomb areas with Marks and Shades, it quickly destroys defenders. 
---
I wish the female sylvari voice would settle on either a UK or AUS accent. I love Jennifer Hale but this is the only game where she seems to have difficulty with consistency. 
---
I'd love to have more of these fucked up things. Like in episode 3 when you find bodies that look like your character.
---
I guess a Dragon eating the very fabric of the world is pretty fucked up though. 
---
It's useless from Level 1 - 80 because the Expansions require level 80 to access but it's good to grab them when sales happen because they are discounted. 
---
I advise playing core game for now until yu are satisfied with it and grab up expansions when they are discounted. 
---
Longbow doesn't bother me but druid staff does. Why do I sound like a submarine?!
---
Ah Canach, you got all of GW's personality.
---
If I am understanding you correctly...No, it does not work like that. Blasting a field to others is limited to 5 people.

Commander: What about the towers?
---
\*towers explode in the background\*
---
Canach: What about them?
---
Meta revolves around current patch, not what anyone think what should be or what will happen. :P Currently you need to provide like 60% boon uptime to let your chronos do rest of the work with spamming SoIs, even in not organized group. That's one of the reasons why tempest can now provide whole raid with 5 or 6 typical boons with ease. After chrono nerf? Well, we will worry about when, and if that nerf happens.
---
Main issue I have is the fact they introduced chairs at all. Back in the days you boasted with Chaos gloves, Obsidian armor, Tormented weapons, maxed titles. Now you spam your credit card for that. 
---
It's true that GW2 is very dynamic ... well, I'll try FF XIV someday, I guess the free trial is still present ?
---
Thanks for the info.
---
thx. Seasons ends in 5 days. When starts the next season?
---
Any group that runs two healers and thinks the second healer *must* be a druid is kinda missing the point, I'd think. Druid's not bad as a second healer (I think its redundancy is a *bit* overstated by some) but there are certainly options that perform better in the second healer role. 
---
Besides Largos, where it's understandable, in most situations any other secondary healer will add more value to the squad. Most have stronger heals. For examples: 
---
* Renegade(/Herald): Assassin's Presence, Soulcleave's Summit (renegade), can also do alacrity, boon extension (herald). Of all the non-druid healers Renegade is the most offensive with AP and Soulcleave, which are also extremely good for classes that manage to get to the crit cap and attack fast (IE: Dragonhunters, for whom spotter isn't that useful.) 
---
* Tempest: Auras, lots of extra boons, condi cleanse, large range, boon extension. A bit of build variety in depending what you want. 
---
* Scourge: Barrier, huge rez potential, condi cleanse. Can be a huge hard carry especially on bosses like Slothasor where conditions and downs can be rampant in unorganised groups.
---
* Firebrand: Lots of aegis and stability, large heals, can also do quickness if needed, also if traited in Radiance can share signets for their own Discount Glyph of Empowerment (lots of build choice for firebrand tbh). Feels like it has a lot of build variety depending on what you want from it and how much healing the group needs. 
---
* Meanwhile a second druid provides: Extra spirits and glyph of empowerment (sometimes), fury and spotter for the other subgroup, some extra CC. Sometimes this isn't really needed and one of the above is better, sometimes this can be good. And depending on boss some spirits won't do much, like sun spirit on a boss like Sloth or Samarog.
---
Canach is my favourite character from GW2, his dialogue is pure gold. 
---
On the cele build you're not condi, you're hybrid. Against decent groups a large part of your damage comes from power, so prec and fero are very useful. Healing power still boosts barrier. Even dps scourges put out a reasonable amount of barrier as additional group support.
---
Cele stats if you use the majority of stats are quite efficient.
---
Did you try raiding? 
---
You're bored and that's fine. Move on.
---
Find something else to play, maybe have a look back whenever some new patch/update hits.
---
Don't fall for the sunk-cost fallacy. You say you've had 4k hours worth of fun from the game already? Sounds like whatever you put into the game paid you great dividends already.
---
P.S. No amount of 'goodbye'-posts on reddit is going to make a difference. They're not monitoring those. What they are monitoring is the amount of people logging in and any change therein. Stop logging in: because when you keep logging in nothing will change.
---
While they cleansed fast, everyone have limits, in prolonged battles, importance of conditions rising. Besides chill and cripple breaking flow of movement even if it lasts mere second or two. 
---
What mouse do you have?
---
It's not hard to outheal druid. And the combo heals aren't anything special really, especially when you consider the cast time for *Ice Spike*. I agree with u/RhenCarbine; it's all about the water autos and *Soothing Mist*. I've only played support druid and heal tempest but *Water Blast* is very reliable (you only have to aim your camera somewhere at your feet) if your group is stacked fairly closely. And in my experience running a minstrel/cleric setup, I generally get 1.3k heals per auto spam and between 850 - 870 ticks for *Soothing Mist*.
---
interesting, thanks for the tip but sadly we don't have this sale in Europe
---
im on the exact other. i love the gameplay, but the content is lacking. but you are correct, the gameplay the whole season is stale. its pof 1.5. and pof is ls3 1.9 with mounts and new elites. god i miss the feeling exploring hot. something new/challenging around every corner.
---
We didn't have new emotes in ages, and the ones we had were already in game as NPC animations, so sadly not gonna happen any time soon :(
---
yeap!

In season 1 days he was the antagonist in parts of the story that launched Southsun island and the karka/consortium. Even then he wasn't a straight up baddie just trying to do a good thing in a really really wrong way.

Wow, great job! And thanks for the effort of putting subs!
---
&gt; for more than 4k hours,
---
Found your problem for you.   
---
Of course you'd be bored. 4k hours is an absolutely massive amount of time for a game, or, for that matter, any hobby.  
---
Try playing something else for a change. Or go pick up smithing, or skydiving, or mountaineering, something for a change of pace.  
---
GW2 has about as much "action" combat as AoC back in 2007 did, if not less. It's nothing to write home about in comparison to quake, an example of game with real action combat. 
---
&gt; Is necro (/scourge/reaper) actually viable in WvW?
---
Scourge? Yes very much in zergs. Reaper? No. It has no real role in zergs and necro in general sucks massive donkey balls for roaming due to lack of mobility, escape, stability, anti-CC, and survivability in general. You only have burst damage, provided you will ever hit anything at all, and that is it. 
---
For pve theres no such thing as “good bow build”
---
Reaper is an absolutely useless troll spec, it does not have a single relevant ability in WvW context. Meanwhile scourge has barrier spam, abundant boon corruption, passive condition spam, and massive damage that bypasses projectile reflection. 
---
**S**out Flanked?
---
In an MMO, after 4000 hours, the only thing that would keep anyone going is playing with friends. The social aspect. No MMO really offers 4000 hours of entertainment. 
---
There's either required grind or voluntary grind. In other MMOs, they make it so that you have to keep treading water. New expansion brings all the numbers higher. You've got to relevel to max, get the newest stats on your gear and even then people play them for 3-6 months and they leave.
---
This game, the big difference, is that the grind is voluntary. It's all about picking goals and doing them. If you run out of goals, you're out of game, and you move on, because 4000 hours is a lot to get out of any game.
---
Me, I'm here for my guild and the social aspect. I run content, instead of just playing, so it's a different feeling for me. I have like four times the hours you did, but I don't worry about playing efficiently, I just do what I want, when I want, and a lot of that is helping new players.
---
At the end of the day, there aren't any other MMOs that would keep me busy four 4000 hours without the social aspect anyway.
---
Ferocity and precision useless stats for power damage? Is that so in counter-strike? Because in GW2 it isn't.   
---
Healing is extremely important for self-sustain and support in zergs. Scourges get to spam a ton of barriers.   
---
&gt;  Those stats doesn't seem usefull for a build that is focussed more on conditions?
---
But what made you think that scourge was a spec that is focused on condition damage? It's mostly a power damage spec in WvW context. 
---
Well my logic here is that anet finds a way to trigger the bug then turn it into an emote. At least the animation is there.
---
Wishful thinking but yeah. The closest thing we've gotten to a new emote are chairs, and even then anet went on a roundabout way to implement them, using mounts.
---
You can use whatever you want in PvE. I play bow/scepter,torch burn dh in wvw. It's a condi build.
---
Logitech
---
What they means is that bow isn't very useful in group PvE (dungeons/fractals/raids). Bow is perfectly capable in open world PvE. 
---
Bow used to be used in PvP on Dragonhunter, but I'm not sure if it's still used.
---
Maybe I just got the (wrong) perception that a necro must use conditions, because it fits that image better :D PvE seems to be a lot different then WvW..

---
Do I just put all the folders in Guild Wars 2 folder?
---
Pretty lucky on the infusions. Static with a average of around 750 essences and the group has gotten one celestial infusion.
---
It's not that scourge isn't a condition spec, it's because Engineers and Firebrands are prevalent in zergs so your conditions will be cleansed before they deal any significant damage. This is why scourge is either grieving, marauder, or celestial; condition damage alone is no longer enough in the current wvw meta.
---
If you enjoy using it then use it. Yes your dps will be down compared to using GS, but often that just doesnt really matter. What matters most is youre having fun.
---
Theres something about that feeling when you catch out someone in PvP or WvW while youre fully buffed up. They start to prep their defence, expecting you to leapin, and instead you pull out your bow and take half their health in an instant. A decent bow build can force the enemy to either close the gap to you, or run away. Both things you can use to your advantage.
---
In PvE, your dps isnt optimal, but if you concentrate on learning and executing your rotation on a decent build, youll be ahead of 90% of players anyway.
---
Hot diggity daffodil!!!
---
Damn, this is some really complex insight, thanks!
---
I own the Watchwork Mining Pick, which i bought years ago for like 500 gems when it was on sale and it pretty much allrdy paid itself back, thats what i was looking for, but with the introduction of glyphs i thought there would be a certain combination one should go for the best outcome.
---
I was hoping to read a comment like this, thanks, I'll surely try it.
---
The longbow sound on my guardian isn't bad. Scepter noises, though, make me want to turn weapon sound effects off (if that is even an option).
---
I dont particularly mind it, but I would much rather something a bit crisper and easier to identify with other sounds happening around you. I like to break out the bow in wvw if my ping is bad, and the current sound makes it really hard to get skill timings right.
---
1° with the megaservers and how the maps instance works, you can always be in a active map with people. World vs World is way, way more inactive than 3 years ago. PvP never was that active soo hardly any diference there.
---
2° 3 years is very long time for a Mmrpg. Nobody but arenanet have the numbers but its impossible to actually say with a straigth face the community is bigger now than 3 years ago.
---
3° Oh its not going down I can garentee that. It will be online with a small community even 5 years from now. Dont see gw2 going out any time soon to be honest.
---
4° both expansions add hours and hours of in game content and are tottaly worth getting it. Even more in this phase where every triple AAA gaming company wants all the money of the world for barely anything. The relation between price/ content makes the expansions a good purchase. Dontnget deluxe versionsat start, buy the normal ones and decide if you want to upgrade to deluxe later, after exploring them.
---
5° PvP still have a respectable community. WvsW is such a small part of the community you need a magnyfying glass to find them.
---
6° the expansions bought with them specializations with allowthe classes to use diferent weapons, even dramatically changing the way the core part of a class works. Unless you want to do high end game stuff like raids or T4 fractal, you dont need too overthink too much about it.
---
Rest in Pepperoni.
---
mounts are faster then players with swiftness.
---
It depends on how you look at it. To me, everything is hidden in that maze of a city.
---
Canach is best succ 😍 
---
Solid choice - I'll second this recommendation as they're all good trait and good weapons. 
---
I'm a big fan of phantasmal defender and disenchanter - they can really help with crowd control when you're feeling overwhelmed. Mantra of pain is a solid AoE attack. 
---
Signet of Ether is a decent heal, but its real utility is that it resets the timers on phantasms so you can fire them all off again almost instantly. The sword and greatsword (traited) phantasms pack a punch, so it's definitely worth taking.
---
I'm not a fan of any of the core elites, but the signet can take the heat off battles sometimes. 
---
This is the only real answer in this thread.
---
If you are serious about WvW, celestial scourge is nearly useless. Healing power is a wasted stat on a scourge. Your barriers are not your strong point. Your strong points are massive aoe spike damage and corrupts. Build around those.
---
Roccat Cova. Best choice for me in years.
---
11 buttons is enough to bind everything.
---
I use two big additional buttons for Action Skill and Elite skill, both m4 and m5 for heal and additional middle button for mount/dismount. Buttons on the opposite side not really ergonomic, so I use them for volume control.
---
Wait, you think you get wxp that you have not earned? Wxp is distributed on an individual basis so you must have done something right.
---
Actually, what server are you on?
---
Read through your keybinds then
---
Yes please. It would make it so much more reliable to not need to log in after the time I logged in the previous day.
---
Hard disagree with the fractals comment.
---
Please keep your Cele Scourge in WvW.
---
Yep, I recently found out about this too and it’s awesome 
---
Hmm off the top of my head 
---
HoT 
---
- gliding and leyline masteries
---
- access to raids
---
- certain armor stats like minstrel and viper
---
- guild hall access 
---
- unlock 9 HoT elite specs like tempest, dragon hunter, dare devil, reaper, etc
---
- gen 2 legendaries like Nevermore and Astralaria 
---
PoF 
---
- mounts 
---
- mount masteries to gain abilities for each mount
---
- new armor stats 
---
- new elite specs like weaver, soulbeast, firebrand, deadeye, etc
---
- wvw mount (warclaw)
---
Biggest reason to get both xpacs is access to the elite specs of each profession imo. 
---
thanks, yes I see how few extra buttons can make the difference, I still click on some skills (engineers) and  ineed to free some keys from mount bindings
---
Its not bad for taging mobs in large events.

I just imagine that warrior saying "Boink" everytime he will jump up xD

Rytlock: "Line!"
---
I always see the auras on myself when I swap, but the few times I've remembered and checked a teammate there was nothing. I dunno what the cooldown is though, I never remember until mid-fight.
---
But...but War can double jump, why would he need a Springer? Death on the other hand...
---
I never said never. But even you can notice that after he is more .. smart as\* then before

Not an expert with thief so I can't help you much with your build, but what I can tell you is that as a thief you shouldn't 1v1. Instead, use your high mobility (shortbow #5 for example) to create uneven fights (1v1 + you = 2v1 etc) and help your team secure quick kills by doing so. This is called +1'ing.
---
Naming and shaming is warranted, only special snowflakes like the spineless ANet team don't like it because they're too afraid to police their own fucking game from some trolling 14 year olds.
---
Which is still anoying if you don't gather at the same hour every day.
---
As WvW player that was around... they missed perfect timing to release it in Summer of 2018. Nobody cares anymore.
---
They announced it after pip update in summer of 2017.
---
Its not really a grind...
---
&gt; Is there really a reason not to heave a heart vendor unlocked forever once you have completed that heart?
---
Afaik they did this for PoF an onwards heart NPCs, but haven't updated the LS3 ones :(
---
Also some LS3 hearts seem to lose progress on reset, others don't. (Iirc Bitterfrost ones lose it, Siren's landing ones don't.)

The next elite specializations will focus on abilities that consume salt and reddit posts. They will be OP at first, forcing people to reddit to complain, inadvertently boosting them even more.

Fishermans Stew? Fishing confirmed?
---
Considering that it is quiet easy to make money in GW2, if you dedicate a couple of days to it, more people than you expect buy these with ingame currency. I did so as well on my second account with LW2 and 3. And is one episode not only 200 gems? Some of the LW maps have really good farming spots to make even more money.
---
Pretty and very effective. I always found it less intuitive to have skills on 6-0 since it requires so much travel. 
---
Keeping permanent swiftness of yourself is the best thing you can do now. You might get lucky and find a commander who isn't using a mount so mountless people can keep up, but that's going to get more rare as new WvW players go back to PvE and all that's left are the veterans who are going to always use the mount since it's a disadvantageous to not use it.
---
Yea, Cele Scourge is complete and utter trash in Fractals.  Condi Scourge is actually really good if you aren't going for "uber tryhard speedclear" strats.

L2P issues.

Depending on the scrapper build there are some things that can kill them 1v1 like glassy soulbeast can burst the scrappers that only run 1 stab &amp; 1 stunbreak (typically purge gyro builds), spellbreakers can stalemate all scrapper builds and on occasion win vs some builds if they play the better of the two. Things like condi rev and condi mirage can win 1v1 against the scrapper builds that don't go with purge gyro. And so on.
---
The reality is that the PvP playerbase is not very good these days and has been used to very one dimensional damage orientated type of play, so sidepoint bunkers or the notion of decap builds is a shock too many.
---
/blowkiss

Hallo.
---
Has the community grown? Nope.  
---
Do you see the community growing? Nope.  
---
Will gw2 still be around in a couple of years? Very casual, but yes.  
---
Copy paste builds if you.wanna be effective. In lots of content you don't need to be effective because the content is easy.  
---
Pvp and wvw are mostly neglected and spiral downwards. 1 update every year at best.  
---
If you're ok with limited story or open world content it's great. If you want pvp, wvw or raiding it's still a great base game but not really getting any further additions. Probably not worth.
---
This stunned me the first time I found it out.  Every once in a while when Jake uses a funny/deep voice you can hear little hints of Canach in there.
---
This is the only character I'm really pumped to see every LS...
---
LINE!
---
I'm sure we all want more frequent updates, but given they've just fired half the devs, it hardly seems likely.
---
i Saw w you did there.. hehehehe
---
Super speed almost the same out of combat. Besides its WvW, immunity to chill and cripple cannot be ignored.
---
And multiple maps fail every day every spawn.... They are trying to help people and its often been a topic on here how badly this event fails. Stop being a knob and let them help 😉

Dont worry. Take him if you wish. I will make a thief who will look like [Strife](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/darksiders/images/c/c6/Strife.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130220075648)
---
You can always wait and save while you play, and if you like what you saw, get one or both expansions by then.
---
Content has only being getting better, so don't be discouraged if early content feels kind of lacking.

It can reduce the time to get map completion by a almost a half.

"Commander, we need to find out more about the League Of Suspicious Characters!"

The Commander looked up from his collection of pies that make his sword sharper for some reason, and said "Have you tried murdering everyone? I think we should murder everyone."
---
Scarlet was in Jahai Bluffs in the ??? section of the map that you briefly go to for story progression.  She's there to start you off on the "Run Around For No Reason" adventure.
---
&gt; I do run, interact with crystals, etc., hit buttons.
---
I noticed you left out the single important item.  Do you actually finish the race? 
---
You can always roam until you get the mount and just occasionally tag along zergs for a while. The only issue is that you will never want to Zerg after you start roaming.
---
Mirage is great for roaming and has condi e power builds. 
---
Shhh its a centaur in disguise
---
The Southsun Cove story was the first thing that happened in LS1, not counting the first Halloween, in November 2012. Flame and Frost, the very first hints at Scarlet by way of the Molten Alliance, wouldn't appear until January 2013.
---
So Scarlet hadn't started making public advances just yet.
---
Its funny, I think the problem is with other specs. Tempest allows you to either might stack or babysit heal. All other specs allow both because some traitlines are busted. At least ele sees all of its traitlines with some use. 
---
Are comparing planetside 2 to gw2? Now I know you're trolling.
---
Support builds that relies on giving boons will need Diviner's. Another example is Hybrid Chronomancer

I have a Logitech [G600](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Backlit-Programmable-Buttons-910-002864/dp/B0086UK7IQ) 12-button and a [G602](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lag-Free-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B00E4MQODC) 6-button.  The G600 offers the most functionality of course, but for me there are just too many buttons.  I frequently press the wrong ones, and I feel that for me the learning curve is rough.  I use the G602 for all gaming, and along with modifiers like CTRL, SHIFT, and ALT, I can turn those 6 buttons into 24.  I recommend trying both.

Some folks can play on keyboards just as well as I play on my keypads, but I prefer the erganomics of my Keypad.

&gt; I prefer focus to be on the open world rather than instances. I don't like quest hub system while leveling.
---
ff14 is more open world than guild wars 2 in that aspect.
---
&gt;I don't like an end game that funnels me into raids.
---
so like gw2? what other end game is there in gw2 that is still alive and supported?
---
War - Warclaw , Death - Griff , Fury - Raptor  and Strife - Jackal ? 
---
Its so fun when there is social anxiety (dunno exactly how its called in english) and you can push your teammates hahahha
---
This explanation makes sense, although I did think that whole scene was a little forced. Suddenly everyone turns on Aurene so we can get a cool scene where Caithe transforms and is cool.
---
(Which to be fair, I totally want to cosplay her now if I ever get around to going to a con. But still.)
---
Play some other stuff.  GW2 isn't all there is to gaming.  
---
I'd like to have a week event with these changes:
---
* All player damage is reduced to 1/3.
---
* All player healing is reduced to 1/5. 
---
* Out of combat healing is disabled, but players can will heal faster in specific ways, like using a waypoint, using a supply depot or talking with an objective boss. 
---
The info we'd get from it would be invaluable. 
---
It's bad design that it affects your movement skills.  It makes playing a lot of classes awful like Dragonhunter, Holosmith etc.  If slippery slope didn't affect movement abilities it wouldn't be as bad.  But, knowing how lazy Anet implements things, it's most likely coded as a blanket coefficient/algorithm to all movement instead of being specific to WASD movement.
---
Let’s pull tail...
---
Ah yes, the class that can't do anything by itself and literally relies on the other 4 players to carry you.
---
Enjoy playing that "+1 role" (not an actual "role", no matter how many times people want to pretend it is), because you're too useless to achieve anything by yourself, and being a "decap" bot, running away the instant someone shows up to contest you...cause...you guessed it, you're too useless to achieve anything by yourself.
---
Excellent class that will only get "better" (/s) with new elite specs being released on other classes, which gives them similar mobility that contests that of the thief class.
---
Yeah, that's why 90% of this Sub loves him so much. They identify with his 17 year old with edgy jokes and sassy one-liners routine, because that routine resonates with them.
---
Personally I miss a lot of how Dragon's Watch acted in LS1, because their established personalities went out the door in HoT once the commander had to become the focus piece of every conversation since they had spoken dialogue.
---
LS1 Rox and Braham were great, and you can see snippets of their interactions in the current molten boss Fractal. LS1 Kasmeer and Marjory were my favourite characters in the game, but there is no way to see how they used to act honestly. Closest I can think of is ["trouble at fort Salma"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trouble_at_Fort_Salma) in LS2.
---
&gt;Kasmeer Meade: Um... I don't know how to work an arrow cart.
---
&gt;Marjory Delaqua: You don't?
---
&gt;Kasmeer Meade: I must have skipped out the day we covered siege warfare between my etiquette and dance classes.

But Marjory's personality as someone who takes command of situations (since she was a detective) had to be gutted to make way for the commander, and her constant dark jokes and needlessly edgy aesthetic were mildly co-opted by Canach. Her and Canach look like they have a great friendship if LS3's first chapter is anything to go by at least.
---
Kasmeer was meant to be the only socially responsible member of the party (which would not resonate with a lot of reddit, who are socailly malinclined) and be some mild but polite sass and class based observations within the party. Her personality wasn't useful once we reached cultures outside of Kryta, and she has been kind of driftless ever since.
---
I'm hoping that the big redux and focus they gave on trying to carve out new niches for Rox and Braham mean Marjory and Kasmeer are getting that focus next, and that them being out of the plot for so long is the writiers not trying to do much with them until they can get their arcs/revamps going, but I guess only time would tell for that.
---
TL;DR - Brahamn, Rox, Kasmeer and Marjory had way more personality in LS1 and they ruined it with HoT. I miss how they used to be, and hope they'll keep trying to properly sort out ways to use them like they have with Taimi, Canach, Rytlock, and gotten into with Braham and Rox a bit here.
---
Please dont remove them. They are perfectly fine and people only need to get use to play with or against it. The same can be said about the others . There are things to be said about some traits wich will destroy you based on map mechanics. Social Awarness can be devastating in Siren's Reaf at the last boss when you need to get everyone into the green circle and yet dodging the wind. But slippery is just annoying and nothing more. 
---
&gt;Oooh, I do like that!  But to that (and everyone else who commented on the helmet) I ask, does this \*really\* look better?  I didn't  "forget" a helmet, I just preferred the Norn facepaint and braid over any of the ones that I had seen =\]  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;That's a good option though!  I haven't worked through much of the GW1 rewards yet honestly! 
---
I must say this is the most creative method I have seen utilized to protect a camp. I'm even more impressed that it worked.
---
Yeah, I'd look around at certain builds then. The stats are definitely useful, but it just depends on how much you actually enjoy playing builds that aren't *full* DPS. 
---
It shouldn't oneshot instantly, malice exists for a reason. Right now you get one shotted from simply being marked and with one stack of malice, which is pretty stupid.
---
After rework to malice it seems like intention was to make DE spend initiative before it gets access to huge burst, but you can burst someone down without even using initiative because of signet+stealth skill.
---
&gt;! You become effectively the size of a human! I have the highest height slider on that toon in particular and sometimes get covered by other player's 
---
Uh... my thief d/p main is an Asuran. People called me the mr hippty hops in wvw zerg fights. The only dagger; worth getting is the incinerator because you can see it. Pistol not really see it but the aura is there. I want to see it and enjoy it during small fights and when I stand idle by.... I understand but zerg fights you dont see it as much but in wvw fights people naturally spread out especially on uncoordinated fights.  Tonic.... no. I still stand by my point to increase size of the weapons for asurans. Not really incinerator but the other weapons especially the smalls ones.

---
There can be multiple reasons for the "far away XP"
---
The ones I know:
---
-don't mistake Pips and reward track gain with wxp/wep (WvW experience)! You will gain points for your chosen reward track every 5 minutes (timer at the top of the screen) as long as you participate to the match (e.g. Kill guards/players/supply yaks, flip camps/towers/keeps, destroy enemy sieges..) rated from 1 to 6, the higher the participation the more reward track points gained per 5 minutes. You can see your participation right above your minimal if you hover you mouse over those little green bars. If you reach a participation of 3 or higher you will gain Pips too, which are basen on your rank + current placement in match + outnumbered buff + if you finished the wooden chest last week. 
---
-if you attacked a camp/sentry post/whatever but didn't manage to flip it, because you were killed, and someone else of your team manages to do so a bit later, you will be rewarded as well even if you are on the other side of the map
---
The one that gets tons of comments saying 'git gud,' every time someone posts about removing slippery slope.  
---
As a note, you are NOT looking for WXP. You are looking for reward track progress. To this end, make sure you have all the WvW reward track boosts you can get (Guild Taverns have a boost, you can buy an infusion for your amulet at the laurel vendors, use any birthday/celebration/whatever boosters). Reward track passively happens every 5 minute "tick". WXP happens only when you tag a mob or player who gets killed or help take a structure.
---
I agree to say slippery slope is ok. The one that I really hate is the flanking one where you get randomly one shot by a trash mob on your back. It makes some fractals (swampland,  oasis, siren's reef) just horrible because of all the trash mobs.
---
I think it's fine on some fractals (like Molten Facility, Molten Boss), but for the most part yeah it's a headache that messes up way too many abilities and just adds tedium and frustration to many encounters. It should just be blacklisted in 100 for example.
---
I'm really not the best to answer the exact question of Scourge build. My guildies are the Scourge players, and I don't mind when they take Condi Scourge (most of the time, I agree with /u/Zman1719 that when I'm pushing for speedclear strats or CMs I don't want Scourge at all). 
---
The heal Scourge is alright. If they can keep up 25 might, it's not too bad. If it's just a casual fractal clearing with some friends, I definitely don't care, I'm in it more for the time with them anyway.
---
But, again, if I'm looking to clear fractals pretty quickly because I only have an hour to play,or if I'm practicing tryhard strats, I don't want the heal scourge.
---
Celestial scourge is just right out though. It doesn't do shit for DPS and its barriers are wimpy.
---
Well, i play minstrel chrono in WvW and hit like a noodle and its pretty fun. I guess for PvE outside of raids the stats are not that usefull, as i dont play raids.
---
My general recommendation is to try roaming first. Particularly based on the build you're using. My go-to is a Necromancer where I can easily solo camps as a reaper or I can change myself into a Scourge for zergs. All you have to do in the end is to keep participation up and then hover around a keep and a tower and take it when a tag comes by.
---
Another thing to take from that scene was that until then, she was less a dragon minion and more of just our pet dragon. After she learned to brand, that's when the realization of what and who she actually was became much more real and apparent. She wasn't just a dragon that hatched to help us, she was a Branded, a Dragon Champion that we decided to raise.. and at that very moment, a great deal of fear went through everybody because if Aurene for a moment got reckless, it could spell disaster for anyone in her path, friendly or not. Canach pointed out a fact, something a lot of people may have forgotten up until that point to begin with. It may have felt like a forced scene, but the reactions felt right for what was being done. Aurene always had a blue fire breath.. and now she began to brand with it. It was never seen before then, and everybody was already on edge because of the Kralk threat.
---
Just to point out, but - if all you're doing is running WvW to fill out the Warclaw, my experience is that whether groups "want" you tends to be a little irrelevant. On my server, at least, 
---
for about half of any given day it's practical to find a large zerg and follow. And, yes, you get killed a lot - often when trying to catch up after the last time you got killed. But equally, there are a lot of commanders out there who are aware that not everyone has the mount yet, and are tolerant and considerate. 
---
Yea I’m in full ascended besides my back piece. My personal Rank is like 46 so I have some progress to make but I’ll definitely start doing that if its as lucrative as you say. What makes you that much gold on 61 or T4 though if I may ask?
---
Sure, I always get to the finish line. No point in running if you're going to just stop partway lol.
---
What should I do turn spirit shards into gold?
---
    Here you go - ("[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Horse\_(racer)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Horse_(racer\))")

Post it like this to make it work.
---
Achievements are such a bloody mess in this game. If you missed out on LS1 or older festivals you're completely and permanently out of the AP race and leaderboards. As an AP hunter it's my biggest regret playing this game. 
---
In the dragon's stand fight he sounds like a character from South Park
---
AMAZIN
---
You'd need to significantly lessen the stacks applied, perhaps one hit = one stack, even. Your proposal would make condis too powerful.
---
They should have kept it as currency for decorations or whatever, ideally they would have made it account + guild bound, so you had to do things with guild X so you were able to buy decorations in the Guildhall in guild X only.
---
Would have been a great currency for the tavern too! You want bonus XP/reward track gain/harvesting drops/.. spend a bit of the currency you gained while playing with your guildmates! 
---
I once tried to heal someone who was close to death with the druid 5-&gt;3 staff combo. I basically stood still because of slippery slope and the poor guy succumbed to his wounds. It really should not affect movement skills. 
---
Agree i did 100 for first time today with slippy slope as a holo and had no issue whatsoever.
---
We Bleed Fire does too much damage to parties in full zerker's/viper sure. It's entirely manageable in other builds. I think that's the intent behind that Instab. Whether finding a way to push more members of a party away from full damage builds is a noble pursuit, idk, but it's worth exploring at least imo.
---
No because a lot of condies/boons can be acquired by spamming random buttons and being in combat while cleansing actually requires some timing (using a skill that cleanses 3 condies is pointless if you're affected by one or two harmless condies; some condi cleanses usually have big cooldowns).
---
Half classes can get might by simply being in combat or using skills that they'd use for damage anyway. Same can be said about condi application.
---
Yeah... I find it particularly annoying on 100CM with a tempest. My rotation requires careful position for max dps and it's very tricky to do it while you are sliding all over the place. I'm not even gonna talk about Arkk's last 30%... It's just ridiculous.
---
I mean I could live with it in lower levels (it can be kind of funny sometimes, especially in the recommended fractals) but I don't think having an instability that is impossible to counter and heavily affects the movement, makes much sense in CMs. 
---
Which iirc just in the last 10 days there was at least 4 days with slippery slope in 100CM. It's not fun. And that's the worst thing you can say about a game. 
---
I can't work out if you are giving bad advice in good faith, or you are trying to drive them away from WvW. Roaming on a Reaper may not be the best idea.
---
As a note, dodging moves properly and makes you stop sliding --  so if you need to end up somewhere, dodge towards it and don't move after.
---
It can still be frustrating, but it's a bit of a workaround at least.
---
I did a Google search but that didn’t tell me much. You are such a welcoming community. Wow
---
Hmm, can you explain please?  I don't follow how this would make conditions too powerful.
---
Right now the argument can be made that condition cleansing and boon ripping are too powerful, which, I think, encourages K-train zerging and faceroll skill use while discouraging diliberative buildcraft.  I feel that *that's* when the game becomes all about having more players than the opponent(s). "Numbers."
---
Awsome thanks!
---
Very cool, Kanye
---
I don't think so. Try asking support for help, they usually help you out, if you don't make mistakes like that every other day.
---
No problem, if you're looking for more resources, Discretize's website is a good fractal resource. Good luck!
---
Anything challenging with friends. I've played on and off since release and friends are what keep the game fun and engaging. WvW roaming with friends is big fun. Raiding with friends is big fun. Fractals with friends is big fun. Regardless of the rewards, I find playing with friends is worth it even if I already have completed daily/weekly/CM reward.
---
[But why male models?](https://media.giphy.com/media/jaKhN6iJXjFmg/giphy.gif)
---
I'll explain the build, but it's rather out of the meta.
---
What you do is supply barrier while putting out some condi damage.  Your main role is perhaps boon stripping. On engage, you use your skills that strip boons. On the "bomb", you use F5 and your elite. 
---
I haven't used the new Harbringer shroud, so I can't help you with the mechanics on that. I am guess it's taking that for the large torment stacks. 
---
FWIW, the meta is power based builds. 
---
Getting your bombs 10 second sooner can be very impactful in big fights. 
---
Just saw that note in the wiki that it's not account bound.. totally lame!
---
You are paraphrasing and "interpreting". If you want to read it that way, I'm sure you will.
---
On the one hand i completely agree with you that achievement point system has failed in guild wars 2.
---
On the other hand though taking away the success from the people that really did all the achievements since start of the game only because you cannot obtain them anymore does not seem right...
---
I have most of the current available achievements myself and i would like to have the ones you cannot obtain anymore but its still impressive if someone has done everything over such a long period of time regardless if you can obtain them anymore or not.
---
You're welcome :)
---
I'm a big fan of Bounty glyph myself, it essentially works like the candy corn gobbler buff that give 33% chance for extra strikes. I bought Bounty glyphs because I got tired of spamming gobbler to get the buff. 
---
Also I like knowing what extra items I'll get, so like if I go Elder Wood farming, I want extra elder wood and not leather or some other mats for example. One time I was lucky and got 6 Orrian Truffles from a single node! Bounty glyph ftw :D
---
Industry Glyph is awesome too. I have a nearly full home instance and it got to a point that I dread farming it because the process takes so long. So I bought the glyph (the first one was free from Glyph patch), worth it! I put Leather glyph in Consortium Sickle because the sickle's original speed is so fast there's no need for Quickness.
---
There are lots of variety of Glyphs available.  For the more expensive glyphs, most of the time it's more value for money to buy an unlimited tool from gemstore that comes with the glyph than to buy the glyph outright from TP. So do check the prices before buying :)
---
Oh and if you do want to buy a glyph from TP, check which glyphs are in BL chest for the cycle. More supply = cheaper prices.
---
&gt;my experience is that whether groups "want" you tends to be a little irrelevant. 
---
I am most definitely paraphrasing here
---
&gt;Canach pointed out a fact, something a lot of people may have forgotten up until that point to begin with.
---
It should also be noted that Canach himself had to deal with being untrusted simply due to the fact that he's a Sylvari. Were I in the same situation the double standard would be incredibly irritating.
---
At least for my guild, we're realizing that mounts aren't great for excursions with the squad. You usually get such a large tail that you spend more time waiting for people to catch up than you normally would with just a perma swiftness group.  
---
Mounts are great for if you're really far behind the squad, but if you're in the group, you generally get there fast enough off mounts, especially since mounts in enemy territory go about as fast as someone on foot with swiftness.  
---
I hope the sentiment of not being mounted in the group travels further so it doesn't alienate those without mounts.
---
&gt; Braham's personality had TONS of room for growth before they wasted him on an emo "revenge for mommy" arc.
---
Saying Canach is edgy one-liners is no more reductionist than your statement there :p
---
Canach has a rough history he has been trying to move past where he did dark vigilantism against the consotrium. Braham went on a crusade against Jormag because he regreted his mother dying. Canach got a lot of innocent people caught up in his bio-terrorism and Braham got a lot of people caught up in his crusade when he led them north.
---
The only real difference is Canach got people killed, Braham got stopped before they all died. That's the only difference.
---
Canach sat in jail for his crime and eventually decided that what he had done was wrong. Braham joined back up to help fight Joko and the Inquest there, eventually deciding what he had done was wrong. Their character arcs are, honestly, pretty damn similar outside of the root motivation.
---
&gt;For whatever reason, they just developed him way more
---
That was them dropping a lot of LS1 development for everyone else, and it no longer being available. Canach didn't start getting character development until HoT, so his arc is something you can still replay and see.
---
&gt;I just don't think it's fair to say reddit likes him because of edgy one liners lol
---
It's not all there is to him for sure, but even in this thread, that's all people ever do is quote his one liners and then say how much they love his attitude. It's 100% his greatest appeal to people, because characters are loved or hated based on their gimmick appeal. There is plenty under the surface with him, hell there is for every character, but the surface appeal is what lures people to be interested in him in the first place.
---
He's just stating the facts? He ate a guy and absorbed his magic as Elder Dragons do. That line wasn't even rude or disrespectful.
---
As an experienced raid commander, I can confirm that asking people to ping something unrelated ("ping your favorite hat", "ping 250 veggie burgers", etc) yields better results than asking for KP. The vast majority of people that actually read the instructions and ping what you asked for (or something equally as silly) end up being better players than pugs that ping 250+ LI and tokens. I could give a crap if you've cleared the boss a hundred times: it isn't worth anything if you come in with an ego and an expectation that you can greed instead of doing the mechanics or pressing f on the downs.
---
Much of the community has already learned the lesson that KP is mostly meaningless by now, but there are definitely still large parts that haven't.
---
&gt; I really don't understand how can people complain about bleedfire, boon instabilitites or birbs while this thing and the new SA exist.
---
because those things deal dmg and kill players that dont take measures to mitigate them. The new SA deals zero dmg and only messing with a teams positioning if they are stacking. SS again zero dmg just a instability that messes with your movement. I agree that messing with player movement with SS is terrible, its manageable but the fact that its on 100% of the time makes its even more frustrating. 
---
You missed the next bit of that sentence.
---
&gt; but when you can't even see the telegraph on the non boss mobs and the new fractals implement a ton of new dodges you need to perform it just isn't fun.
---
Oh

Wait a minute, you just made me realize, do horses even exist in Guild Wars?

I've heard it from someone that apparently gets information from an Employee, but that already around 3 corners to me, so trust these information with care.

Playing this quest as a charr was something else. Reminds me a lot of our current political climate of xenophobia. Being attacked on sight by separatists, finding demonizing propaganda everywhere, and facing people on soapboxes preaching hate...spookily real.
---
Are you serious? I love to rip on this game for unclear things all the time but its right there in the tooltip. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistlock_Instability:_Outflanked    "Foes within 300 range do 300% damage when attacking from behind, but only 75% damage when attacking head on." If you turn your front to the mobs, stack them up, during the skips use things to protect yourself/teammates this instability a non factor.
---
[Laughs in Daredevil]
---
I believe you can still get like 1k influence for completing the zhairan story or for doing map completion. Some hope there
---
Guys guys you don’t need to buy more bag slots.  Just give *me* your stuff!  
---
I’m a problem solver.
---
why blue ball yourself for 5000 hours?
---
When you read that tool tip what is the first thing that you think it would be? why? Testing will probably be needed to get the finer details cleared up. Start with a cautious approach assume its the biggest flanking range possible 180° and narrow it down from there. If  the flanking range is bigger or smaller you will be able to figure it out.
---
&gt; encourages K-train zerging and faceroll skill use while discouraging diliberative buildcraft
---
If boon rip and cleansing weren't strong, something else would do the work of encouraging the lowest common effort level among (casual | lazy | efficiency-oriented) players.
---
A lot of folks gravitate toward minimal effort for maximum output, changing the condition landscape will just move the goalpost on that. Ignoring whether it's a good or bad idea, that gravity well of effort avoidance is still going to happen en masse because people like it that way.
---
I love that slightly raspy voice that Zojja has. Both of them have really talented voice actors who totally nail the characters.
---
D: does it really effect some of the class skills that much? Don't take it away :&lt; it's one of my new favorites, i love it when its paired with SA. 
---
Keep the emails preciously, they'll help you with support interaction if you need them someday.
---
I was a hardcore achievement hunter during the first years, and gave up back when the festivals started to get really lame.
---
Achievements in this game are a mess, mostly because:
---
* Many are based on pointless grinds, dumb stuff, or shameless money sinks.
---
* Points balance is all over the place, with no sense of direction whatsoever.
---
Nah, just remove that shit. It's awful. Tampering with your control is a poor excuse for a creative idea. It was never fun and it will never be fun.
---
Don’t play the profession/build you *want* to play.
---
Play a profession/build that gives you a lot of swiftness uptime.  Those perma 25% run speed signets/traits are a start, but find something that can get near perma swiftness too.
---
Ex:  Soul beast ranger merged with a bird gives you almost perma swiftness with its F2 skill.  It’s F1 skill gives you a lengthy forward dash, too.  Ranger also has a perma 25% run speed utility signet and Greatsword 3 is another forward dash.  
---
Then just pewpew things as best you can with whatever build you end up with.  It doesn’t matter if you’re top DPS.
---
The joys of temporary content.
---
I still can't believe anyone approved the fiasco LW1's temporary nature was.
---
Where is my Skill Drain. 
---
I am one mini short of the old miniatures collection :'(
---
Thanks bro I’ll try 
---
Joke's on you, most of it is accountbound.
---
No, it was the old one that *made you think* and either spread out or accept consequences. New one just doesn't allow you to make a "wrong" choice. Great design.
---
And I think that you and a lot of other people associate "bad" with "dangerous". Yes, new SA is relatively harmless, less threating than birds and stuff, and won't lead to total failures, but does it make it less retarded or annoying? I don't think so. 
---
The more spontaneous the better. Gosh I am already so tired of the "VICTORIOUSLY flee for your lives" 
---
You asked about nontarget MMOs. Well, that's it.

&gt;I don't understand how player to player transactions could hurt the economy either?

While we are at it, a small anecdote: A few days ago I was not able to do a part of a legendary collection inside a fractal, because I needed to do an emote at a certain spot and emotes are not possible if you have Slippery Slope since you are basically constantly moving ... so I guess better luck next time?
---
I'm f2p and I whisper, but not continuously

---
That 29.99$ is worth a lot for most of the world
---
&gt; a lot of people
---
Do you have an example of that?
---
It's not the same when you can't bring it with you to other maps, and when the enemy is stationary.
---
I like looking at Geralt. No homo.
---
You make a good point, but I always felt the special skins during the early living story sections were the ''accomplishments''. I went through hell and back unlocking some of those because it was looking like they would not return. Unfortunately, so my dismay they ended up returning and even becoming much easier to obtain. I do think it makes sense for them to return but at slightly different colors or looks. 
---
Achievement points are something else. It's merely a number and shows the amount of goals you have reached over your GW2 career. If it stopped there it would be fine. But they tied rewards and a leaderboard to this number and that is where it becomes an issue for me. There are physically rewards in the game right now other people can obtain and I can't because I happen to not do something 6 years ago. The leaderboard also has no value what so ever because you already limit the people who are even able to compete. Basically the people who are up there right now, will stay up there and never have any competition. I in fact would be up there if I finished achievements years back. Unfortunately at this point it doesn't matter I got the hardest, newest and most expensive achievements you can earn in the game. I got nothing to show for it because of this system. 
---
I'm just frustrated over the system and need to vent about it every once in a while. If only I bothered all those years back and went for the achievements instead of unlocking the skins and quitting after that... 
---
People can still trade manually via mail, they'll just risk getting scammed.
---
If you want to make sure you won't lose your trade, then just pay a bit of taxes. 
---
Gold has to leave the system for the economy to stay healthy, and trading post taxes is one of the ways for it to happen.
---
Well that’s definitely an opinion.
---
nop
---
&gt; Limit of 500G a day means you need to instead use mystic coins as a currency which adds another layer of conversion to a transaction.
---
It’s worse than that. It’s 500g per week.
---
It would be fun for activities designed around it...say an ice boss with specific punishing mechanics that are not necessarily ohko or something like that...
---
Good old Drakkar Lake, always fun to win outnumbered fights versus those guys.
---
I may be the minority but I don't think Slippery Slope affects gameplay at all (like 90% of the new/old Instabs, especially the simple damage modifiers). On the other hand I dislike new Social Awkwardness, I just don't like the fact that others can push me around.
---
Here they come fam.
---
one of the main problems that adds to that is how stingy they have become with giving out AP for achievements, I just don't even bother with most of them because they are like 1 - 3 AP each, its a waste of time
---
It sucks considering achievements are the main content in this game.
---
season 1 is a sore spot not just because of AP, but skins, titles (hero of lions arch) and the experience itself, so many people talk about how that season was fun, you could actually see the effects of the story on the world and now people who started after that will never know what the world was like before or be able to experience the story as it unfolded. i know i regret not playing LS1, i was playing the game at the time I just didn't play the story
---
I dunno...320 slots is a longterm goal for me l0l
---
I read the title as "tribute to Fractal Giraffes"
---
We just skip it if it has slippery slope or birds now. It just makes the game not fun to play. 
---
If quickness is being discussed as low value in wvw, I think people are either joking or missing something. It's been a big deal for a long time, finding sources for it makes a big difference.
---
Alacrity I'm not 100% sold on - you're correct in what you say, I think it's just sort of finnicky to apply reliably, even with renegade's traited size/target bonus. It's huge value, it's just too reliant on external factors for the damage tradeoff required to build for it.
---
it makes it a lot easier when farming or doing hp trains / metas / bounty trains because you can go a lot longer without having to stop and clear out your inventory.
---
I prefer kp being random so it is less reliable as a metric. We need less "do you have this many of item x", not more.
---
I have seen people with 500 LI make just asany mistakes as people with 25 at times.
---
Yes we should compare inflation in real life to an online economy. I don't want to sound desensitized to your point but we can only look at inflation through the scope of materials. Here the main factors are supply and demand though and the biggest demanders are people striving to craft legendaries who might not want to put the time into deforestation. Supplies respawn every single day so that means money spawns on a 24hr clock, you just need to go and put the time into gathering it.
---
Nobody out tying up offers of the trading post is worried about inflation of materials because materials are literally spewed out from every mob you stab.
---
It is not necessarily teasing yourself lol. I find women more assthetically pleasing, regardless of my "mood".

It's the kind of thing that's best when baked in from early development, and we're way too far from that to even start that kind of discussion tbh.
---
Which boss needs finely controlled positioning?
---
its a orange circle that gets sucked into the mobs then explodes outward shooting the projectiles out that dmg/burn you if you get hit. Bonus fact, they get shot out in a pattern and its the same on every mob.
---
I believe you misunderstood: The implementation of the instability results in your character to be constantly declared as moving, no matter if you actually do or not - even after dodge, rezz or whatever - making emotes impossible to use. (yeah, that also means guaranteed Sea Weed uptime, if anyone still cares about that.)
---
Works fine for me ´=(

This was done on purpose to curb players scamming each other, and more importantly as a gold sink to slow inflation.

A katana is more of a long sword.  Meant to be wieldable with 1 or 2 hands (like long swords in real life).
---
The Japanese greatsword would be called a nodachi I believe, and they weren't especially common.  At a certain point more length doesn't really help you kill anyone, it just makes it awkward and heavy.  Unless you can shift where you're holding the weapon, hence why spears and pole-arms were probably the most popular weapons throughout most of history.
---
You mean the Mirage? Loooool

In the middle of March sales? That was... short-sighted of you.

Hopefully they'll be cool about it, though.

I think it's wrong for people to do shady things like this however its up to the buyer to also inspect what they're buying before clicking accept. You don't buy a new car or house without first inspecting it after all.

Get both HoT and PoF, play PoF first to unlock all the mounts, then go back and play HoT. HoT’s maps are harder and more complex and the mounts help and are especially fun there. Don’t bother with the Deluxe editions at first, you can upgrade to that later in the gem store if you want.
---
None.

Weren’t greatswords for when someone had so much metal armour on they didn’t need a shield?
---
I'd have to say pretty much all of the Skritt are addicting to listen to in a comical sort of way. They are the best at mid battle call outs and remind me of the Grunts in Halo.
---
MANY SKRITTS! HELP!
---
Hmm, let's see...
---
1. I don't believe so.
---
2. Depends on the boon, some will replace the shortest/weakest existing stack, others will just bounce off. If there are multiple targets for the application, those who can receive additional stacks will have higher priority as far as I'm aware.
---
3. Aegis blocks damage, Stability blocks CC - you need both to block both.
---
4. As far as I'm aware only players can critical hit.
---
5. Soft CC helps, but it's rare to find an enemy that both has a Defiance Bar for it to affect, and is weak enough for the soft CC to break it without help. In terms of immunity, soft and hard CC follow the same rules - enemies are either vulnerable to all of them or none.
---
6. No, it only works when the bar is blue.
---
7. It depends on the enemy, and the specifics aren't player-facing, but generally speaking it will either target the closest player or the one dealing the most damage.
---
8. When they are used, as far as I'm aware.
---
9. I don't believe so (in the sense that your actual Health needs to be above 90% to get the bonus, regardless of Barrier), but I could be wrong.
---
10. It should, as the version of "Eye of the Storm!" Gale Song activates does count as a Shout, but I'd need to test it to be sure. Shocking Aura would certainly help CC a boss, but I wouldn't call it reliable, largely because you need to get hit in melee range for it to work. If it's all you have it's better than nothing, but there are better options available.
---
11. Additive. I believe it can technically scale up to 100%, but there aren't many ways to do that.
---
go to the fractal vendor and trade those 5 salvage kits for the 5 package and voilà, 4 slots saved !!!

It’s not just you it’s happened to me too with crab toss where I don’t get participation or rewards even though I won the entire thing. I bug reported/sent in a support ticket about it over a year ago and they haven’t fixed it because they don’t care about this content anymore unfortunately :/

Noob question but who is Elsa?
---
Birds on Sirens' Reef was EVIL.  Can't use the cannons well because you  have to drop to get the birds off you, and CONSTANTLY out of endurance on the main fight because there's like 7 different things to dodge at any given time.  
---
slippery slope and SA are pretty evil on Sirens Reef too.
---
It depends on your playstyle. My most played characters have 110 slots (5 20 slot bags, 10 shared inventory slots) and I don’t run out of space that often. 
---
That said, I don’t like farming and I have a lot of characters. Several of my characters are essentially bank extensions and I switch characters instead of builds. Having separate condi and power characters means I use way less bag space on extra gear and food. 
---
On the other hand, I know mesmer mains with 320 slots that are still out of space constantly because they carry so much gear. 
---
wrong part of the story; im referring to when kralk starts a brandstorm in thunderhead keep and it starts getting out of control so aurene 'rebrands' it and everyone but the commander and caithe start freaking out

It's in the line of ore nodes, up and to the left as you enter the instance.
---
The longer reach gave you the chance for the first hit &amp; a better ability to combat people armed with spears which were incredibly common (mainly because the increased length and weight allowed you to parry multiple at a time then cut them all up with a single swing)
---
They were commonly used by Romani, Swiss, Scottish &amp; Japanese for this function.
---
Miyamoto Mussashi described there advantages and disadvantages pretty well in some of his writings.

---
This is exactly why when I came back to the game and decided to stop playing alts and role just one character I’d play(don’t worry I kept the other 30+characters for bday gifts and storage) the first thing I did was max out bag slots and storage tabs. Waiting on the material stacks increase to go on sale to finish maxing those out too.
---
Druid buffs actually aren't limited to 5, just Glyph of Empowerment, Call of the Wild, and the healing on their skills. The might and spirits are 10-man. 
---
There is just so much wrong with this, yes renegade firebrand and cweaver are above mirage, ON GOLEM. As soon as you factor in confusion damage it easily outclasses all of them on what people tend to call condi bosses, and no, scourge stacking is defintily not stronger than 6 mirages lol
---
no\^way

This is in the open world public version right?

Next expansion release date has been leaked : [https://i.imgur.com/wme1NHv.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/wme1NHv.jpg)

Idk, the mounts are getting me to stay in WvW longer and actually join up in the zergs.
---
We’ll see if that lasts, but so far it’s been a positive impact for me as a single point of data. :/
---
No\^( ∞ )
---
Because spamming kamadan trade chat is not fun.
---
I’d at least like the option to salvage these slots if I decided to delete that character as for now if you purchase they are for that character only and if you delete that character you lose them forever.
---
Tbh they should just triple the price and make it account bound . for those who already have them then those change it for every three you have it makes a 1 account bound and if you have more then 30 to give you all maxed characters then your out of luck or you get gems back (less likely) 
---
1. Look at your mini map, and find it there. Zoom in if you can't see it. 
---
2. Enter the instance, and go left through the first house and out the back. It's along the fence. 
---
not really, no
---
Ah my bad. I wasn't entering the instance and just using my griffin to get in.

The Celestial Scourge build is designed to allow players to survive in close range fights whilst still dealing effective damage. 
---
Scourge, and Necromancer in general, has quite good power coefficients as well as a large number of condition applications on all skills, as well as barrier making healing power more useful, making Celestial the logical choice since you benefit from all the stats it gives.
---
This build in particular is played best when using all facets of the kit, which makes Celestial the easy choice. 
---
If you are looking for more damage, supplementing with pieces of Grieving gear is the best thing to do. Condition duration in WvW is not nearly as sought after as it is in PvE, as the conditions are removed before being able to tick for their full duration, so focusing on higher Power and Condition damage (as opposed to Viper's for example) is the best way to go.
---
Just as a side note, Celestial actually gives the 'most' stats in the game. Take for example the headpiece, Celestial gives 210 stats, whilst a 3 stat headpiece (like Berserker's) will give you 150, and a 4 stat (like Marauder's) will give you 168. So just purely mathematically, if you were to use every stat celestial has to offer, it is an incredibly efficient way to gear up. This doesn't make it BiS, since it lacks focus and almost all builds don't need some stats as much as others, but in the case of this particular build is a fantastic statset to have. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/GyZR2.png
---
No, in that case they'd still use a longsword and shield, because armor still has weak points. 
---
Greatswords were mostly used against spear formations, since they were long, heavy, and a good swing could push away and potentially damage many spears at once. They could also be half-sworded by gripping it partway up the blade and used as a short spear. 
---
Aside from that, the iconic greatsword didn't really see much real use. There just weren't a lot of situations where the extreme size was helpful and a polearm wasn't better. 
---
What the heck is that? Horses? On Tyria? I'll have none of that!
---
You don't.
---
Thanks for plat, my roy boi!

I think the reason I reduced Braham is because his whole arc after Eir's death was entirely out of left field. The regret of his mother dying doesn't make sense in the scheme of things imo. Just looking at the timeline, he lived almost his entire life resenting Eir, hating her even. He only stopped hating her in season 2 when the two of them fight the sons of Svanir together, somewhere in 1327. Eir dies early in the HoT story, which takes place in 1328. At absolute most, he had 1 year, much likely WAY less than that to even get to know her. For her death to not only change his entire character, but also incite absolutely brain dead actions like trying to take on Jormag alone is simply unbelievable to me, since he had already gone through Mordremoth and seen what Dragons are capable of. And that's not even addressing how openly hostile he became to everyone else too. From a gameplay perspective, it's not that bad, but from a narrative perspective it feels really nonsensical. Also, he looked better with hair.

And why it will probably take anyone who started today *years* to get the later pieces of the armor sets you can earn. And the way the game seems to be going lately, there's a good chance that won't even happen. I'm all for grindy achievements that give you a cool cosmetic to afk with and show off your no-life skills, but having to plan around getting a full armor set in a few years seems a little bit extreme for probably the most "casual" (in a very non-derogatory way, it's why I play it!) MMO out there.

It's your one chance to be like Tom Cruise in Risky Business.  
---
So they don't have attacks with multiple aoes and designated safe zones? Are you sure? 
---
Not really, greatswords were used both before and after plate armor was used. Even though they were widely used during the full plate era, they seem to have been more common after full plate started falling out of fashion. Landsknechts were famous for example, of having units using greatswords while only wearing a metal breastplate and a helmet.
---
Can we start shadow-banning people who post about this from the subreddit

"Just blow the damn gate, Canach!"

If they're adding GS to even more classes I hope they completely change the running/idle stance on male humanoids, it's so fucking awkward looking and counter productive
---
Hmmm.. i did log in from time to time throughout the years trying to play or testing some things etc.. could it have really been that coincidental? Because i have every single episode from what i see except for 1 from the first season and 4 other ones from the second season
---
It could be, ofc. Releases are from about 3 months each, it means 4 chapters per year, so yeah, it could be that you had logged in between those.
---
And I'm just saying that vilifying people unapologetically based on slanted articles normalizes unapologetic behavior itself. If one wants to criticize musk and win over others to that viewpoint, at least take the time to explain specifically why (and provide direct sources), rather than just virtue signal: "The fuck is wrong with yall?...". Sure I can give you the benefit of the doubt here, but how can I know for sure what you're saying accurately portrays what's happened? You can cherry-pick a random article that says what you want it to, but that isn't a real effort.
---
Everyone comes from different backgrounds and what you find absolutely reprehensible, I might enjoy, find funny, etc. There are no "good" people and "bad" people, just people trying to figure out what good and bad are and people assuming they already know. From my perspective the whole elon pedo situation is just a large misunderstanding.
---
There is such a thing as a misinformed opinion however, and I think everyone needs to make sure they've closely examined their own arguments to make sure they themselves aren't wrong. In the age of clickbait, everyone is writing articles and opinions. How can I be sure yours are valid compared to the 50 others I've heard that were more eloquently put together?
---
Elementalist is probably the class most in need of a complete trait tree rework. It has a huge number of dead traits, either because they're straight-up worse than the alternatives (Ex. Conjurer or Lightning Rod) or because they synergize with traits in other trees for some reason (Ex. every single boon trait in Fire/Water/Air/Earth). Additionally, the power gap between the standard specs (except probably Fire) and the elite specs is probably the widest in the entire game, leaving the trait lines feeling very anemic and making me feel like outside DPS I'm supposed to be getting an extra specialization for a "real" kit. I suppose that's the effect of balancing the elite specs by nerfing the core class so many times over the game's lifespan.
---
IMO the themes of the four elemental trees need to be reimagined for the modern design of the game and paired with free-standing mechanics, instead of all this nonsense with each element getting a matching Aura bonus. Then Arcane should be granted all the Aura boosts outside maybe the heal-on-aura effect from Elemental Bastion.
---
Literally never; terrible idea
---
It doesn't matter in open world content, in fact it may be stronger for solo play overall. Not damage-wise, but in terms of added survivability from the fact you can play from a distance.
---
"Oh no I cant movement abilities"
---
The only point where that matters is Nova Launcher in 100/75/etc. In any other case, the instability demands of you to use less movement skills, which, given that every class has static weaponry and skill, is very easy. Just branch out from the meta ONCE. Deal a bit less damage, make adjustments when you DO use one. 
---
"I dont adapt so I have a bad time" well no shit sherlock
---
You know, if you really wanted, you could go with Greatsword &amp; Longbow. You have two weapon sets available to you as a Guardian, so why not use both and get the best parts?
---
Before I settled into Condition Firebrand, I used a Greatsword / Longbow build that did well throughout Heart of Thorns and Living World. 
---
Jup, it was just recently. Made 7 different people ragequit since we could just not pass against skelly boi.

I'm sure there are some that can do it faster, but I've done map completion 5 times and I estimate an hour per map because that's how long it generally takes me. 
---
There is a rather rude Norn at the bar on the cliffs behind and between the Bear and Snow Leopard lodges, standing in front of a rather large horn IIRC.  She is the only whispers agent I recall running into there.

The first week or two yeah, but they have toned them down now, only thing I think is get ride of the cc immunity and it would be fine

If you're only going to accept information in the format you want, in the tone you want, and of the content you want, and dismiss everything else... ultimately you're only going to only hear what you want to hear.

I may not be eloquent but it's also not my job. I could keep pulling up more examples of how he is a "bad" person and is cognizant in his decisions, but why bother if how I serve it to you matters so much?

I'm past the point of trying to win people over to my side because of thought processes like yours. Yall want to defend shitty people doing shitty things and making this world worse? Reasoning didn't work. Being polite didn't work. I'm not one to resort to violence so I'll just enjoy yelling into the void, thanks.  
---
I might be remembering wrong but I think one of the Town criers by the Crafters if you speak to them as a whispers agent she will answer you in The whispers code.
---
Maybe you're right yes. I did put a lot of effort in the viper gear, since it was my first ascended set.
---
However, I don't have a 2nd set ascended gear for my necro. Is it ok to use exotic?
---
I disagree. I think WvW changed for the better, and in a fairly significant way. The change the mount brings itself is small, but the impact it has on the game mode being enjoyable is quite huge. 
---
It used to suck hard to die in WvW. It would take FOREVER to run to the other side of the map, only to get picked off when you’re 3/4 of the way there by a thief. It was especially brutal on classes that don’t have much swiftness.
---
Mounts make it a lot easier to stay on tag, or get back to tag, and I think it’s a small fix, but is actually very good for WvW. 
---

Throwing more people at it doesn't necessarily make it go faster. Sometimes it slows everything down.
---
When certain areas have to be deemed Slippery Slope nullified, it's better off to just remove it outright. 
---
If anything, change it so whenever you have Swiftness, you get Confusion.
---
To clarify. You don't need level 80 gear. Any gear will give you same stats. Don't need accessories. 
---
&gt; I understand that you can use mail as a crude trading method. I just want ArenaNet to explore the option of making it more refined to cut back on scamming. 
---
They already spend at least 5 years exploring with that and dealing with the aftermath. Based on what they did afterwards it can be concluded that they did not like what they found in their exploration.

Hows bad necro zerk build compared to condi dps? I want to play zerk necro in fractals, but I dont know difference between dps

If you domesticated tamini, would that count as a  horse?

You could also always have saved up and bought it direct from the TP. We didn't have to do amalgamated gemstones and mystic coins were 5s each. Th major cost of a legendary was the precursor and the T6 mats.

If you're a reaper you should go full zero anyway. 
---
Expansion is the answer to that, but no, they decided to do season 5 instead. Game feels pretty stale and dead right now. I can't even imagine what it will be during another season of living world.
---
No. Upon entering the sPvP lobby you will be set to level 80 and you can then set the gear/stats you want to use. The menu is at the top middle of your screen.) You have to bring the weapons you want to use, but your amulet provides the only stats that matter.
---
Keep in mind that in order to get any defensive stats you need to have a shirt, pants, and helmet on. Running around naked does not give defensive stats.
---
&gt;hence why spears and pole-arms were probably the most popular weapons throughout most of history. 
---
And we still don't have them in gw2 :(
---
I turn mine into bars, then mithrillium. Once that's done I transform extras into Mystic Curios. If I have 100 of those I then keep it in my guild bank. You could honestly just sell it though after you keep a couple stacks for yourself.
---
Anet fails to extract money from whales. In other games it is trivial to spend hundreds or even [thousands of dollars](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/6880333/fifa-gamer-ea-games-gdpr-data/) on ingame purchases. 
---
There is just nothing offered in the gem store that would make anyone want to repeatedly purchase large amounts of gems.
---
As a Mesmer main I don't like being locked into a single build so I for one am glad to see more support classes pick up the "extend boons" power but I feel they missed an opportunity to open up a lot more group variety in the recent balance. I could be off the mark but it feels to me like Tempest Air stuff would have been one of the better places to include some Alacrity on more than 2 Elite specs.
---
Seems like that would have been the better boon to give them than a redundant swiftness on skills with superspeed. And would take a notable amount of pressure off Rev &amp; Chrono, giving Tempest more of a place, but not be enough to "usurp" the value either of the others can also bring to the party.

Quickly run up the side of the left ledge.  If you're too slow get someone to reactivate the console.  GW2 isn't exactly a puzzle game so I see little harm in telling you the solution.  
---
What should I spent karma for ? Is there any use for high level gear or anything ?
---
Huh. Guess they could have gone extinct, or very very rare after the Elder Dragons showed up.
---
Gear while you're leveling. In Orr, there are a few exotic gear merchants with level 80 gear. A few Living World Season 4 maps use it as well. 
---
Otherwise, just let it stack up until next time you level a character. 
---
Karma - gold conversion isn't that great. 
---
Put on a movespeed signet and spam swiftness as much as you can. ANet has left us non-PoF players in the lurch for the time being.
---
In my experience, many commanders wait for people to arrive to have more men at their disposal. And since this is what even enemy commanders do, usually the situation is usually quite balanced.
---
Only when there is an emergency situation or to defend a Keep, SM (ecc) that is about to be conquered the commanders point everything on speed.
---
im far from a wvw pro, but my old necro wvw build (pre scourge) was axe+wh/staff
---
axe for unholy feast; though sadly doesnt give ret like it used to; also no projectiles is nice
---
wh primarily for locust swarm ton of lifeforce if frontlining
---
staff obviously because its mandatory in wvw
---
not sure how it would fare nowadays (i have been wanting to make another necro though...); but used to be a great frontliner back when we had plagueform
---
Roaming as a MM Reaper is fun tho. Your camp clear is pretty solid. And running with scepter as your swap means you have decent condi to fend off any players who find you.
---
They can start by getting rid of Living Season. With the amount of time invested in LS episodes they could have made much more money.
---
But sadly we know that they already started LS5 which will be the demise of this game.
---
I don't care what the rest of the community feels about it; I would kill for a well-designed mounted raid encounter.
---
Thx for the good advice
---
... have your tried looking to your left at that segment..
---
Second, good commanders (in PvE) acknowledge that not all players have gliding, elites, or mounts (in Core Tyria).
---
I know this is an old post, but as a WoW refugee with over 10 years invested... had to share my thoughts.
---
At this point, I do not have much hope that WoW will ever be able to produce a decent expansion.  At least, with Activision calling the shots.  The only thing I can see worth playing, is WoW Classic.  If they also produce legacy BC and Wrath servers, then I would play those too.  Legion was a good place to end my WoW career, as we saw the end of Sargeras.  I had a moment when I watched the end cinematic from Antorus, that "this is it."  It felt like a good place to end it.  I joined in BC so seeing Illidan finally end his story was a good spot for me.
---
This sounds funny, but one of the main reasons I even bought both expansions of GW2 is over the Jessica Price twitter war.  Nothing against her, but I liked the fact that the company seemed to really care about the fanbase... at a time when I felt that Blizzard did not.  So, I voted with my wallet and bought both expansions.  I did play Eve Online for a bit, but that game was just terrible (too much to list).  Once I finally gave GW2 some of my time, I was hooked.
---
Right now... I really cannot find much wrong with GW2.  WvW is amazing!  The lore of the game is quite enjoyable.  I am maining a Guardian atm (boosted to 80), and just love the variety.  I am a bit disappointed that I have to grind points in order to open up both elite specializations.  I am currently working on Firebrand for WvW, and it will take some time at my current rate.  But, this is not really a big deal for me and gives me something to work towards.  I am also leveling a warrior and REALLY love the leveling experience with that toon.  The warrior might become my main when it hits 80.  The variety offered to each profession is fantastic.  With WoW I leveled up all classes to max level, but with GW2... it feels like I will be more than satisfied with a main and maybe one or two alts.  That to me, is a very good sign.
---
My biggest complaint is GW2 should have stolen me from WoW many years ago!  So, I urge all former WoW players to spread the word to anyone from WoW looking for a new game.  This game has my vote!
---
I have already chatted with other WoW refugees in game... and am very hopeful that we will see more people come over from the Dark Side.
---
While leveling I'd always suggest using power to kill things faster and level faster. A [build like this](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Necromancer_-_Power_Minion_Master) works great for leveling (though you don't have to go the minion rout if you don't want to). Fractals prefer power damage, reaper is a better PvE power DPS than scourge so it's automatically going to be the better pick. The recent patch buffed reaper but [it doesn't look like it changed much](https://youtu.be/5z9T5bGSAoA). You can see the old [fractal reaper build](https://discretize.eu/builds/necromancer/power-reaper) here. Power DPS will always have more burst than condi and pretty much all the builds are pretty close in DPS between their 2 versions.
---
If you know your profession well enough take a map hopping build for speed, like a thief might take shortbow 5, then adjust and budget a little for some killing power and defense. Then while you're keeping up with everyone you can see what others are doing generally on both sides and you can shape your build as you go along. 
---
Consider the mounts was added 2 weeks ago or so in WvW it is not possible for it to be there since PoF came out. So not sure if you answered someone else or just miss read?
---
The third is a real downgrade because it's done in a significantly smaller budget by a smaller studiot of a few THQ veterans after THQ went bankrupt and Nordic picked some of them up.
---
It's worse in every aspect, even though Fury's character design and with the hollows looks amazing (and enemy design is on point).
---
It's too bad, really. 
---
Because living world maps are just not good. They look nice and that's it. The only LW map apart from farming for trinkets or gold I go to is Jahai Bluffs to kill the Shatterer for fun. Story? 2 hours every 4 months. Life is Strange has a better schedule than that.
---
The fact that they are free is actually a problem because Anet doesn't many any money from Living World except when players are late to the party and buy the episodes from the gemstore **with real money** since we can convert gold to gems. Only an expansion will make the people realize that the game is still going. No one outside of GW knows/cares about our small little patches.

we get it, you feel triggered, now pls stop spamming it evryday
---
Funnily enough it's playable (30-60 FPS on lowest settings) on my 10+ years old mid-range gaming desktop which definitely doesn't run any current gen AAA games that run decently on even the base PS4 and Xbox One.
---
I honestly don’t even know to to ping like this. And I’ve played for years 
---
Reaper excels at killing veterans, and the added damage and toughness from your minions definitely helps. The condi on core necro is pretty much relegated to scepter, but you can at least defend yourself with it. Its definitely not meta, but as a reaper main I'm not complaining.
---
&gt; They only raised that cap once in 6 years and 7 months.
---
To expand on this they will probably only ever add bigger bags. I don't see a reason for them to increase the cap when its much easier to just add bigger bags.
---
60 gold a day is a real stretch, even if you convert your matrixes to keys.  Where did you get this number from?  I must be missing something.
---
You should look into updating your build when you get a chance [dT](https://discretize.eu/) is a good resource for end game fractal builds and guides. If you want help in game I'm happy to do that as well.
---
I'm guessing that 66% increase is replacing the 33%, not adding to it. Also, out-of-combat move speed with swiftness is 391. The universal move speed cap is 400. So the 66% increase won't be very effective out-of-combat (but will be in-combat).
---
Fractals, PvP, WvW, Dungeons, Meta map events that require about 100 players to make it, world bosses, story missions, ap hunting, new maps every time a new chapter comes out, skin and cosmetic, crafting, adventures (tons of minigame), alts (gw2 is very alt friendly), collections, flipping the trading post is what i could come up with without looking in to the game and see what i missed. 
---
While true, Kas had a good place in POF too.  As someone who used to be pretty religious and played the first game, her experience and struggle with Jory resonated with me pretty well.
---
I didn't get that sense at all. How much bigger does he need to be? You're smaller than his eye, and Aurene looks like a bug flying around him.
---
Having him be large, but not so big that he can't fit on the screen is a narrative thing, too. Do you think about all the insects that you crush underfoot or vaporise with your windshield on your daily commute?
---
Past a certain point, you can be so big that when you kill things, you don't even realise it. And that's not a particularly compelling threat. Kralk needs to be small enough to see and recognise the death and destruction he is causing whilst still being big enough to cause it, and I think his size is perfect as it is for that.
---
And Primordus has already appeared in-game.
---
You're not a real Fifa player if your squad doesn't look like a rainbow.
---
Fractals, laurels, guild vendor, ls3. You cant craft ascended trinkets and there's no point of getting exotic ones since ascended is much better, cheaper and easier to get.
---
They will probably do neither.
---
That said : increasing the cap = increase a number somewhere, also potentially sell more slots. Add bigger bags = create items (the bags themselves, including the common sorting versions and the weight versions) and acquisition methods (other items like supreme rune, recipes, collections, whatever). I really don't see how adding bigger bags could be "much easier" than increasing the cap.
---
Ok well it is a big deal when it is in WvW were you mostly can not change map without ending up in a queue. And were it happens frequently or like the other day when the comander got it and could not go on in the end and had to relog and ended up in 50 man queue then it is not fun at all. 
---
And it is also very intimidating to see dead people riding on a mount whilst being dead and i can not even start to imagine how that bug happen. The person is dead and riding a mount. Like what? :D
---
Simply because he won doesn’t mean he didn’t lose a lot of magic along the way. Think there are a few lore speculations that could be made (although they are reaching a bit). Maybe it requires lots of magic for him to enter the mists? Losing the shatterer could have harmed him a lot. Although at the end of the day it probably was just the fact that the engine couldn’t handle anything else
---
I wish they would reimplement Season 1 into the game rather than push the story further. It's very confusing to new players that Season 1 is unavailable.
---
Well.. [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sentient_Anomaly) and [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gleam_of_Sentience) might help. I mean, *technically* it turns loot into more loot, but in practice it's loot that's sellable or salvageable. So.. less becomes more becomes less? More or less?
---
Season 3 is always the best and fastest way. The other places you can get them ([like dungeon collections](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zhaitan%27s_Claw), raids, mist trinkets, etc) are a real pain.
---
"Run around the map and find these 33 hidden items, for 1 AP each time you get 11, for a total of 3 AP." Or donate a total of 500 gold worth of X to Droobert for 25 AP!!" 
---
How do you port a game with so many controls? I guess GW2 would be easier to port than WoW, but it would still be extremely clunky.
---
Krait just don't like other races. They are there to enslave and even eat people that they capture. So I'd say they showed up just to hunt your group and aren't directly connected to the risen there.
---
It’s funny that the OP is freaking out on consuming the items when you explained that’s what you’re supposed to do. I just lolled. No biggie brah!
---
Iirc they planned him to be bigger, but his size starting being an issue. 
---
Why do I like your keybindings so much.
---
&gt; Lmao I know how to do jumping puzzles

Oh my god. He looked 100% adorable O.O

---
Yup, it's an atrocity and should not be in the game like this. And while we are at it, please remove social awkwardness and birds - basically anything that takes away control over my character's movement and/or is nothing but an annoying hassle (birds).
---
Well firebrands are easy to find. Renegades on the other hand...
---
"Grind out a mount too". Takes at most 8 hours. Get yourself a mount and you will see it will be worth the effort.
---
unfortunately anet seems either too stubborn or maybe there is some technical limitation/other reason for why they don't do it
---
it has been requested over time for certain skins found on NPCs across the game for years now..
---
so yea, sorry to disappoint but for one reason or another it's probably not gonna happen
---
Speaking of Darksiders, GIMME A HORSE MOUNT SO MY NECRO CAN COSPLAY AS A HORSEMAN OF THE APOCALYPSE DAMN IT!
---
Bleed Fire is kind of stupid in some fractals, but on its own you can deal with it like you do with Frailty or Outflanked. It just scales badly with many mobs and the daily rotations like to give you exactly those instances.
---
No Pain no Gain is really bad on exactly one fight, Subject 6 if you try to burst him. For LFG groups it actually becomes a tough DPS check, and boonstrips are rare. Same for Sugar Rush, that on Subject 6 is a tough draw.
---
Birds are stupid in hundreds of ways. It's a drain on endurance you have zero control over (i.e. getting birds milliseconds after a mechanics dodge) with no counter or balance. The actual bird spawns aren't even mentioned in the description and mess with everything from combat status to target cap to scaling with certain other instabs like bleed fire, toxic trail or others. I personally think that this instability in particular needs a rework ASAP.
---
Slippery Slope is, as I mentioned in another reply, unfit for fractals and should probably be removed. Social Awkwardness is another one that you can find many places in the fractals for that aren't made with this in mind. The gimmick of not being able to stack is fine, but in some areas you don't have enough space for five players, or some have to eat mechanics because LOL. That's just as dumb and I personally was fine with the pre-patch SA.
---
Yeah true, I'm dropping to sub 30 fps regularly with my newer i5-6600, gtx 960 machine so it doesn't scale well.
