Isn't Braham half Norn too? 
---
---
---
It's all good :) Just gotta keep the subreddit tidy. It's been reposted a loooooot today, you're not alone :) 
---
Take a look!
---
At some point I just gave up and made an empty chat tab just for PvP. Seriously, my sanity is worth more than an ephemeral strategic advantage in something that I just can't care about any longer.
---
"Everyone else is doing it so who cares"
---

---
What a defeatist attidute. This is part of the problem, making toxicity of PvP norm. It's why it has grown into norm over the years. It didn't use to be *this* vile. The change for better comes from all of us. If we just shrug it and do nothing, it will never change for better.
---
You were gradually getting better at it.
---
No. It has been stated reproduction between different races is not possible so a half Norn is not a thing in world.  
---
Thanks mods!
---
 As a dev, there's literally no reason I can think of not to release the source code. The *only* legitimate reason to not release the source code no a project is if you plan to make money off of it, and considering this is (apparently) so heavily leveraging ANet's stuff... Yeh, no.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Probably. We sort of saw some eldritch style beings in the Shattered Observatory fractal, as well as the "Voice" in the Deepstone fractal which could be assumed to not be from this world. Hard to say tho because we know so little about what the mists actually are.

&gt;CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD and run a malware/virus/everything scan on your PC just to be safe.

Yeah, you may clean your PC *first*, and *then* change your password.

What's this armor skin?

We should have a policy about no posting/advertising addons or utilities without disclosing the source code upfront.

&gt;Every fiber of my being was screaming "YOU BOOKAHS!"

Fixed for you

Norns are irrelevant.
---
Why am I looking at Drax and John Cena?
---
I prefer pof as well.
---
Other people argued he "had a third of his face missing". Perhaps the severity of the damage is a subjective matter. 
---
Might as well get a love interest for Brahm since he got cucked in season 1.

is there a `P7logs` directory in your gw2 folder?

IIRC Smodur wanted to melt the Claw down to remove any possibility of a new Khan-Ur.

I mean furry artist are good at what they do. They make really good art in terms of emoting and story telling they just also happen to make some of the worst art in terms of taste.

Make it happen Anet. 
---
Is there a class or elementalist build that play like the "Conjure Earth Shield"? I'm finding it super fun to swap between earth shield and water attunement. I love being able to shield bash into enemies and be a bit tanky.
---
So I missed the original thread, but what I have gathered is that it had a telemetry library bundled which the dev claimed was for local logging and the dev was defensive when asked for source code. Also the dev was an unknown with no history. Am I correct in understanding that no-one has captured any network traffic in a packet sniffer (yes I know it can be sneaky and try to delay the phone home or behave benignly if it detects a packet sniffer or that it's in a VM)? Or managed to find any URLs embedded in the binary (yes I know they can be obfuscated)?
---
I get the cautiousness, but it seems weird to me that someone would develop such a unique tool which apparently does work just to deploy some malware.

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.

Bouncing sword comes from GS 2, it shoots out an ethereal sword and it bounces between enemies close to the target

focus fix but no rifle :(

As a side note, the ones that don't say annual persist in the state you left them so if you give the pigs 156 food this year then you can give 344 another year and still get the full AP. They used to have new achievements every year, but this way it allows you to still maximize your AP without feeling like you have to grind for it in one setting. Not that they're hard for Lunar New Year, but it goes the same for the other festivals.
---
In all my years of online gaming I have never had a strictly positive experience.  You can’t control people or their speech. What you can  do is shun people who ARE vile and make it a point to avoid that behaviour yourself.
---
Anet suspends people for speech, it happens. 
---
I’m confident their guidelines include frequency, use of speech, slurs and the like. 
---
It’s human nature to get frustrated and it’s common for people to have bad days. If the people op are describing are acting out of line consistently and voiding Anets ToS, I imagine they’re getting reported constantly, and am relatively confident they will get punished. 
---
What is the point in complaining?
---
Block and move on. 
---
I don't know if it's quite fair to say all code that is not open is automatically a red flag. Yellow flag sure but red flag kind of implies that there is definitely something suspect when there's TONS of legitimate reasons why someone might keep their source code secret. Just a general thing since I never saw said thread or posts.
---
It’s some build that has the great sword 1 effect as a “chain lightning” spell. 
---
What are "unlockers"?
---
It’s some build that has the great sword 1 effect as a “chain lightning” spell.

change password on another device if possible is #1 then clean your computer but if you can't clean then change.

Rockcrusher and Ancestral Guard still don't have proper unlockable skins :(

I believe [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_mrcyIQhPA) is the main one that played there.
---
If you are aiming for account augmentation it speeds up process a lot. I remember my 1st "training" CM100 took me something like 4 hours. But it's important to learn mechanics. After that it's straight forward. As Chrono with 17 kp never had problems with joining 150kp groups. Just do your stuff and enjoy the runs. 
---
Ah, forgot about those things, thanks!
---
Same here, really love those vibes.
---
The question I have with this theory is would Kralk be immortal if he was the one to eat Joko? If Kralk can see the future and can see Aurene coming back because of Joko, wouldn't he have eaten Joko first to prevent that or simply to acquire his immortality? Since it's been revealed he's afraid of dying.
---
Damn it, all that money I invested on ninjas, and now you just set yourself on fire?
---
Truly unacceptable.
---
You arent alone in noting that indeed these people tend to play classes that are considered very strong (mirage, holo, soulbeast, spellbreaker), and this is guessing, but I think part of the reason they get so defensive and offload any responsibilities of their gameplay onto others is that since they are playing the "strongest classes" and normal human instinct is to always assume we are slightly or highly above average compared to others, then; if it isnt me, it isnt the build, it **HAS** to be my teammates (I have yet to see any player ever say "the enemy was better!").
---
@OP: I know this isnt a satisfying answer, but all you can do is simply report, block and move on. Always remember; this is a reflection of their character, they are the flawed ones. Believe in the power of statistics, over the long run, their poor attitude will net them more loses, their poor performance makes their losses more costly in terms of SR. Even if they are skilled, destroying team morale and spending lots of time typing instead of playing will decrease their chances of winning on the long run. Hang in there, pity them, its ok to be a little angry about them ruining your games, but they will eventually be on the enemy side too, so capitalize on that, focus them, make them do the same they did when they were in your team, let your team know their behavior so they can focus them too.

side question but what is stopping people from making a bunch of alt accounts to circumvent the daily cap?

3) Mender 2 / Downstairs 2

If this works, the players could just camp the spawn sites.
---
the difference being that arcdps is vetted by anet devs.
---
i heard a lot of people saying that fractals are a good way to farm, but i don't have ascended gear and i find it very hard to craft it. 
---
Same thing happened to me last night, I lagged out came back and found my entire team just sitting in our base they called me a win trader then I had 18 minutes of dishonor 
---
Oh, yeah, totally. But I’d imagine there’d be one more popular over the rest once it’s in game and the whole community is exposed to it, rather than just the lore geeks and such. 
---
Hi! I am kind of new to this game, and i am playing a reaper atm, but i would love to switch to a scourge, but i find it really hard to get used to the controls and my fingers not being very fast doesn't help. How can I improve at these 2 things?
---
What's wrong with the rifle?
---
I don't think you understand.   
---
Thus is not for me. I've done all raids, got full legendary armor, aurora and am working on the ring.  
---
I don't have an issue with raids.  My main problem is to find groups sometimes as I play from NZ and with limited play time.  
---
  
---
The stepping stones are needed for the people that can't start the raids. The suggestions I've made is based, not on my own experience, but on the discussion going around of should raids have easy mode and how.
---
yay noxxi’s here \o/
---
incredible!!! I'm in love with this
---
You have to say some pretty terrible, !@#$%^ up !@#$ consistently to get much more than a slap on the risk in GW2.  Reporting is pretty much just seen as a placebo unless you can get multiple simultaneous reports from 5-10 people.  Player vs. Player has the potential to bring out some pretty horrific vitriol, animosity and ill-will.  Dhuum doesn't cull players for bad behavior in GW2.  The worst we had is Chris Cleary deleting Darkside a few years back.  I wish players were made an example of.  
---
Hmm, I might just have to make this a mess around first character then. There's just something super fun about jumping into a group of enemies with the elementalist. So many options for survivability, but yes probably lacking damage.
---
Wait, most humans don't know bubbles exists?

Did you not read it?
---
Use a google authenticator... but not googles one.  FreeOTP works well on android.  And if you don't have a phone, there is a windows program that does the same thing.  Secure alt accounts with the authenticator, problem solved.
---
Wow. A pretty decent wall of text and not one word that in any way refutes what I said about Norn. Well done.
---
I'm sorry that you feel the need for Norn to be more like humans. That's really sad.
---
Did you actively read &amp; **comprehend** what I wrote?
---
I could give out AwesomeDPS 1.0 working perfectly fine and handy dandy and share it with Chris Cleary respectively ANET and at any point in time I could modify it's code "to steal your creditcard info" (old meme sorry). Lets' call that version 1.1.
---
If Chris wants to have a look again I could simply share version 1.0.1 which does not include the malicous modifications.
---
If you really believe ANET would crosscheck every single arcdps build you are strongly mistaken and did not read the **bold red text on the arcdps site** or any of it's "fine print".
---
It very well may be an overreaction. But based on the way the developer was replying to questions and the fact that it was a brand new reddit account and an unused github account there was a lot of reason to be suspicious and we just felt it was best to get rid of it to be safe rather than hope it was okay and then have something bad happen. 
---
Farm SW (available to all) and you'll earn about 10 gold an hour on average (not liquid gold but mats value). You'll have ascended in couple of weeks ignoring the initial tinegate of unlocking recipes via laurels. 
---
yeah thats just reddit for you ... while you probably should use such code outside of an clean vm or something it still was actually working code with has proven to increase fps, which isnt that easy to do at this degree, making it at least less suspicious to be malware.
---
While you probably should wait until sources where available, some users where a bit to aggressive and unrespectful for me
---
Arcdps also doesn't provide his source code and people dont complain at all about it (even if the autor is more trustworthy).
---
yourself counts as an ally, always
---
I have actually been hacked before, even with 2FA active on my account.
---
Said asshole, somehow gained access to my NCSoft account (back then Anet used the NCSoft account as well as their own account system)  [No I wasn't hacked or keylogged, the password was stored encrypted, and I hadn't even logged into my NCSoft account in over a year.], added his IP to the authorised user list and changed my GW2 password.
---
Sometimes, using 2FA will still get you hacked.
---
I dont think you read his note in full.
---
Arcdps usage is allowed and users are free of blame, if the dev adds anything malicious, no users will be banned for it, the dev will be punished and the mod is no longer to be allowed.
---
This 'clear' state is just that, approval to use, doesn't mean it can't hijack your login with any update.
---
You should only get a reminder if your IP changes.  I haven't been asked to re-authenticate in ages/years.
---
get a full 32 slot set, much room for activities.
---
Problem is, if someone steals your PC, your GW2 account and your e-mail are easily available to them.  Having the 2FA be on your phone is that it's unlikely that you'll lose both your PC and your phone at the same time.
---
gee that's quite unfair. I mean you can't really win trade, can you? I never heard of such a term since it's never happened and because I assumed with a random matchmaker it was technically impossible. Regardless this kind of behaviour is unacceptable. Mine made an assumption but he asked. You ought to report people without any sensible decency to be polite.

Toxicity is across all games, btw you are not wrong at all

Several of the map artists have a particular signature they "sign" their maps with. The coins are one of them. Another is Tirzah Bauer's [swinging boys.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a2dbxj/locations_of_all_the_swinging_boys/)
---
What is your build and what are you trying to do? If you're aiming for harder content like raids then you can [read the "rotation" there](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/condition/). Also for utility skills it really depends on what you are using as for when to use it, some people in open world run heavy minions even the raid build takes 2 minion utility skills and blood is power (you want to use that with your shade so you can transfer the bleed if possible.)

The 30 kill achievement doesn't work on the new mao

Every day you can buy up to 16 new year envelopes for 1 gold each. 
---
You can resell them on the exchange for 1.5gold or so. So few easy gold every day for you while event lasts 
---
And said " we cant know every update ". Also it wasnt before all the ban on other dps meter was happening and was still widely used.
---
Also launchbuddy didnt have sourcecode available for a while too and it had a lot more to do with your passwords, nobody cared.
---
And so on. 
---
Ascended rings trinkets and accessories are farming in living world season 3 for free. 
---
Those will give you slots for AR to start. Then you do fractals to build up coin and eventually get your set
---
What does even prove? Why is this even upvoted?  Only idiots think this is a good point, "ha u r using a new acc so you are full shit!". 
---
I didn't say it was a problem for me that I am demanding them to fix...
---
I find it to be a minor annoyance, but I deal with it.  Email is more convenient for me, that's just it. Simple. Done.  No need.
---
that means nothing any closed source dev and swap malicious code into the next update and do you really think anet keeps an eye at all times on the code or something?
---
Before this gets locked or removed or smth, I find posting on [https://www.reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment](https://www.reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment) gets better results.
---
Thus is the life of someone who plays anything but Chrono or Druid
---
Very much so. For me the reward is not monetary but skill. My combat skill increased by leaps and bounds just by getting that first kill, this is especially true when playing support. It was more like "If I could druid through this, I could druid everywhere." kind of mindset. 
---
Regular T4s are easy after playing CMs. I'd say the difference in skill between CM players vs regular T4 players are like T4 vs T3 players. Quite often in pug T4 parties, when shit hits the fan it's the players with CM titles that survives... whilst outputting impressive dps.

I think it's more of a prediction. She seems to have nestled herself into our close ring of allies at this point. I wouldnt be surprised if she shows up much more often now

You never took down anything I posted here in the past, sure the only active mod was good old goofy randommabuser but still. I never shared source code for when I bothered to remove reshades network check in custom builds before gw2hook was around so why the sudden change?

Taimi is an Asuran, who are known to make krewes to facilitate technological advancements, however selfish they may thing of them. it's still for the greater good.
---
Destiny's Edge formed because it *had the ability to form*, with slight hints of necessity to fight the dragon champions since no one really cared to at the time. had that necessity and ability existed, Destiny's Edge would have never formed.
---
the only real reason Braham joined the current group is because he feels a obligation towards Taimi's well being, and because during LWS1 Norn and Charr were being beset by a common enemy. an enemy that would later attack nearly every other playable race and their different factions. Norn aren't *against* the idea of teaming up for a hunt, but they'd much rather avoid it possible. which is why he decided to tackle the problem of Jormag *by himself* with a small group of Norn hunters to back him up.

Sounds like the name of a salvage item.

Players suspect it to be Vlast due to the deep voice although it hasn't been confirmed. Ogden refused to comment on it further for reasons in "Hidden Arcana":
---
&gt; **Character name:** I saw the Master of Peace take an egg.  
---
&gt; **Ogden Stonehealer:** Fear not. He did not steal it. He was given custody of it.  
---
&gt; **Character name:** By whom?  
---
&gt; **Ogden Stonehealer:** You know. You witnessed it, didn't you?  
---
&gt; **Character name:** Not clearly.  
---
&gt; **Ogden Stonehealer:** Then you're not meant to know just yet. All things in their time.  
---
Sadly it appears the time to know the truth hasn't come yet as we got no confirmation from Ogden regarding it in Episode 5. Perhaps it's a matter the designers will return to later on if it hasn't been dropped completely.

&gt; As a dev, there's literally no reason I can think of not to release the source code.

Seriously? Okay here's one: One less experienced dev sees the source code that modifies memory and then uses it to create malicious code based on the older one. There's a reason ARCDps is also closed source-

Thats just your usual reddit overreacting way to hard, while most of them use closed source tools with gw2 anyways...

While the author didn't cave out the best responses, it not like Reddit didnt provoke some of them, for something which did actually increased fps and took a lot of work.

Lets just hope all of this didn't prevent the author on continuing his work and provide us with a plan fps increase we so desperately need.

If someone stealing your phone means they get access to your email, you’re doing it wrong. Secure your phone with a lockscreen PIN, face recognition, whatever. There should be the ability to remotely wipe it as well.

BWOOOOO
---
I've decided to go mostly trinkets and mainhand weapon + some armor, to get easier overlap with power build.
---
Fractals have zero barrier to entry, meaning that the first 25 fractals require no agony resistance at all. As you progress further, you will slowly need more and more infusions. You will get infusions as loot, and often ascended trinkets and even gear. The currencies you get from fractals also help you get ascended gear along the way, plus trinkets can easily be bought with laurels if needed. 
---
So it's not that difficult overall, and can theoretically require no crafting at all if you really want. Plus, if you want to stay in the fractals that require no AR, you can. No requirement to move up if you don't want to.
---
Also check out the Fractal Zero to Hero guides that are around, they really tell you how to do things in a clear way.
---
Well, depending on what kind of being [Qwytzylkak](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Qwytzylkak) is (it shares a model with a unique phantom and resembles an eidolon although the true relation, if any, is unknown), Mad King Thorn had a personal rivalry with this one being who could match him when it came to jokes. Sadly the GW1 Hero did Thorn's bidding and delivered the punchline by [killing the poor eldritch being](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Killing_Joke).
---
But given how dangerously funny Qwytzylkak's jokes were (e.g. the infamous "Why did the Seer chase after the Eidolon? Because time was of the [essence](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Spectral_Essence)!" translated from its elder speech), perhaps it's for the best that such a being was put out of its misery before its joke bonanza would cause everyone in Tyria to die from laughter.
---
Other than poor Qwytzylkak, demons are probably the closest we get to eldritch beings in Guild Wars verse. As per the demon article:
---
&gt; Outside the world we know, other dimensions exist, realms beyond what we can see and experience. Civilized humans know that when they die, their souls pass on into the Mists, the realm of the afterlife. Some spirits linger in this world, or find ways to walk back into the realm of flesh...yet there are other creatures who watch them and wait, drawn to the energy of countless souls.  
---
&gt; Sometimes souls are not enough. In dimensions alien to the physical world, sentient entities scheme of ways to enter the realm of flesh, dreaming of the havoc they can wreak. Just as ghosts can defy death by returning to the land of the living, demons find ways into our world, where they feast on suffering, despair, and the vital energy of intelligent creatures.  
---
&gt; Demons are more than creatures of the Mists—they are made from the Mists themselves, bits of etheric matter that have gained malignant sentience and power. Whether they appear as monstrous humanoids, bestial abominations, or radically inhuman horrors, they share many of the same aspirations: the strong consume or dominate the weak, reveling in their feasts and victimization. As they are not native to the real world, demons hold an abiding hatred of its denizens. They are also ruthlessly intelligent, more than willing to enter into arrangements that allow them to routinely prey on humans and other foolish living creatures.  
---
Foo foo!

Been there. Was not allowed to go inside the pools as they are protected.

That looks more like how Jormag is usually depicted. Its probably just a generic dragon tho cos thats clearly not Jormag.

His job position changed. As for his official reddit account - lots of good reasons to delete it.
---
They made a book on why the guild broke up, its quite interesting and I would recommend reading it or finding a summary. 
---
A lot of Guild Wars 2 story is not only from the story, but the open world also has some cool lore in it too.
---
Honestly, I would also be pretty pissed if someone accused me of doing something malicious, without any proof, after I tried to help the community. While I dislike the lack of source code, this whole thread is a shitshow caused by the mods....maybe try doing a bit of research like some people did here (with network packet sniffing).
---
That’s not true at all. I can get a new cell # in 10 mins. 
---
&gt; dev claimed was for local logging
---
Which looks to be correct. From the looks of it, logging was 127.0.0.0:9009.
---
it looks like you're running a more-vitality version of the [Bounding Staff](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Daredevil_-_Bounding_Staff) build on metabattle; solid starting point; Now you can slowly work your way up to full [glass cannon](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Daredevil_-_Power_DPS) for group PvE. 
---
&gt; The fact that his software actually does (more or less) what he promised is another evidence, as a scammer probably wouldn't take the time to develop a legitimate complex tool just to pass on a keylogger.

HAHAHAAHAH. You've seen all the cracked games that function perfectly but have malware embedded? 
---
Yet they forced me to change name, it was Maryjane Fourtwenty 
---
Could be legit he has an open ticket on git hub asking people to do source code security inspection on his releases and some fellow appears to be doing it with IDA.
---
True
---
And furthermore, the people that are saying this are no different than the scammers who try to sell your mom virus protection over the phone from another country.  They are praying on complete ignorance of how any of it works.
---
&gt;AFAIK
---
I like Norns. 
---
So that looks ok for learning the class ? It's so very different than core Thief which I leveled with dual pistols.
---
Also, what sigils for the shortbow ? I JUST made all the gear today and collected the trinkets from LW3 and did a HP train in HOT. Brand new although I did level him up the normal way :)

I went with that meta build to start but I haven't used the Elite or Bandit's defense really yet.

I've just been doing Fist Flurry (Skill 2, then 1).

Also it doesn't seem that it hits mobs behind me. and the jumping backwards dodge is a bit weird.

any advice from anyone would be helpful.

Thanks for your post.

Same for me. Just exchange the "Minutes" with "Days" and you have my support expirence, when my phone got stolen.

And 2FA only costed me 3 accounts on other sites. Tumblr for example refused to remove it, because I had no photo to show them "This is me" 'cause I never uploaded a picture of me to my tumblr page. For the others, I just didn't have enough information anymore to make support belive, that it was me.   
---
On the other hand it has saved me one time from someone login in to my third email adress, which i use as a email for "dubious" sites and so on.   
---
Still use 2FA, because after that expirence it now has to save me some day to make up for all of that xD
---
will never happen since anet would have to rewrite most of the engine an at this point they could have made just gw3 instant
---
Excellent. Fire and Torment it is!
---
So you ran full zerker's from the get go ?
---
I'll replace each piece with ascended zerker's as I learn the class. That was the idea anyway. So you run the fractal build or the Raid build ?
---
The raid build is the one you linked to, I believe.
---
Thanks both of you. I'll level Holo first and then Scrapper. I really like Scrapper's concept but I'll build Scrapper after Holo in the hopes that it gets some good love in PvE. Scrapper sounds like beast in WvW tho so it might be useful to try it in there :)

Anet have shown that they can and will search for programs running on your PC at the same time as GW2  (as allowed per their terms and conditions of service).  Now I had thought that AutoHotKey was one of the programs they targeted, but they hadn't (Cheat Engine was one they did target).
---
However they did change their Macro policy recently and depending on the macro's AHK is using, it could fall foul of the macro policy, which says one keypress, one action.
---
Given that AHK has a comprehensive programming language capable of many things, (I know there's a script for AHK to completely automate a gem farm in another game I play, for example), it *could* be targetted in another banwave.
---
Thank you!
---
An anet dev set a guidelines for that programmer and then reviewed the code I think (not sure), so that's why we use it.
---
Well shoot, that's a really good point.  Now I have a sudden urge to submit a ticket to change my email for all of my accounts to a new gaming email because the segregation just makes sense.  Would be a lot of support tickets though...
---
This is nice! Never knew about this one. Thank you so much.
---
So the effect will not be effected by legendary weapon’s effect right? They will be shown at the same time?
---
It is in unranked. It's not considered rank-ready. Same with the relatively new map (djins) and once upon a time skyehammer (the later has graduated to ranked-ready at some point).

YES this is a huge improvement, was coming to suggest this. Thanks a ton!  So your updater will let us know when the next update is?

Thanks Obama.

I like the intentional ignore on comments that disagree with you while replying plenty of others. Instead make an edit saying "i still think i am right."

Lol.

That's the hope anyway!
---
One could argue that the thief short bow falls under the dictionary definition of a firearm, and perhaps the explosive/fiery nature of the renegade's short bow skills.
---
You're right. After working in a corporate environment, I'm sure they have a legitimate reason not to. 
---
Even though I said "That seems like something easily fixed" in my response, every time someone told me that I shutter as I think of everything that needs to happen everywhere perfectly for the fix to actually work. If it isn't fixed by now, it probably isn't worth fixing. That's even more true when selling a product.
---
From my completely inexperienced and ignorant background on the subject, it seems like easy money. So there must be some reason the experts aren't going with my suggestion.

Fractal 42 farm is faster gold/hr than silverwastes, if you only care about profits that is the current go to.

2 factor authentication is safer than email if you know how to use it
---
And In order for SMS two-factor to be compromised, three things have to happen:
---
The attacker needs to know your username and password.
---
The attacker needs to know your mobile number.
---
The attacker needs access to a phone company.
---
8. Do not let your Web browsers( FireFox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, IE ) to store your passwords, since all passwords saved in Web browsers can be revealed easily.
---
9. Do not log in to important accounts on the computers of others, or when connected to a public Wi-Fi hotspot, Tor, free VPN or web proxy.
---
13. It's recommended to change your passwords every 10 weeks.
---
16. Turn on 2-step authentication whenever possible.
---
17. Do not store your critical passwords in the cloud.

I tried that tool several times before thread got removed and nothing bad happened. I shop online on my pc as well. Gotta run several online and offline threat scans but highly doubt it will yield anything malicious.

Holosmith will be simply much faster for leveling open world then anything scrapper could do

Does that option switch it from the top to the side of the screen or hide it completely? 
---
Number of ppl playing pvp is dropping matchmaking cant deal with it so out of the big pop full of players now we are scraping the bottom .Its only gonna get worse over time. The ones that are left are getting more and more annoyed each day so the number of salty is increasing .
---
Also it does not help that people who afk after 1 bad fight or after they perceive someone has wronged them in any way dont receive much in terms of punishment so they just continue doing the same .There are even bots who play 3000+ games in 1 ranked season since 1 shot macro on some classes is not too hard to pull off and code and it keeps them near 50% win rate . Chat is one of the least problems compared to the rest.
---
It could be using proprietary or stolen technology that he is not legally allowed to use, and therefore can not even say that is the reason it is closed source.
---
This is now fixed. I just completed. There is one map instance where Hilina is standing in a circle rather than by the boxes along side the forge where she won't give you the dialogue you need. Leave that instance and get one where she is in the right place and she will give you the item to complete deed #3. 
---
It's indeed a start, i'll sure as heck try.
---
I tried this tool several times before gw2 forums thread got removed and nothing bad happened. It's been several days already. So I am not sure and actually don't believe it had malicious stuff.

We are literally in a forge, and Taimi did mention that we where going to melt the entire dragon down. Time to get hammering i guess.

I started with the condi build for soul beast in raids.  I don't bother  with raids and I don't use soulbeast for PvE.  I like axe-torch/sb.  In WvW, Sometimes I use longbow to stealthfully pull NPC defenders and switch back to shortbow after the spotter is dead.
---
In the past, there were also cracked roms that contained malicious code. Because the emulator copied data onto the stack, but did not sand ox anything, it could run code just like a scripting engine.
---
Upvote for the accuracy and in-depth detail given!
---
For me, the dailies, I go for PvP unranked. Just win a game and you’ll most probably finish the dailies. Or if for some reason you haven’t finish the daily, go back to PvE and take the quickest one to fill the remaining dailies.

I haven't witnessed what happened here but I know he was on official forums and had to deal with alot of people there first. Explaning his tool and what it does against hate spreaders. 
---
He also said he is seeking attention of Gw2 Devs hence the reason for his thread. Pointed that he will do what he can and tool will need "Anet's touch" to be perfect + some small updates on engine.
---
Thread got booted few days later by Anet. I sent him an in game mail and he told me he is going to make a reddit post regarding the tool. I still have the mail.
---
Seems like he had already enough pressure at forums and then the reddit.. I understand him better now.
---
Uh because this is set in a fictional universe where every race has markedly different skills and characteristics and its weird that only one norn would have a vested interest in saving the world.

I'd like that, the gang still has space for a thief and an elementalist. Maybe for a warrior or engineer too, depending on how you count Canach.

Well, i think i should thank mods for closing topic for now cause with all this witchhunting, somewhat toxicity, prejustice and me being unfamiliar with it, it can go even badly.

p.s. again if you think that i'm a bad person, please give **solid** proofs, not the "he can" opinion.

This is known as the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect) and isn't unique to this game or games at all.  Individuals who lack competence in a given area also lack the capacity to recognize their incompetence in the first place; being oblivious to their shortcomings ("I can see nothing I did wrong") while still experiencing negative outcomes causes the rationalization to search outside the self for the cause ("I did fine and still lost, so my team must have done poorly").  
---
It's the nature of the beast that this behavior stems from the same place that makes it impossible for outside forces to change it.  The only solution, besides numbing yourself to it, is to control your exposure:  create a new chat tab just for PvP and turn off every single checkbox.  Unfortunately, people typing in /say will still have their message appear visibly above their heads, even if you don't have the local chat enabled.
---
**Dunning–Kruger effect**
---
In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people of low ability have illusory superiority and mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority comes from the inability of low-ability people to recognize their lack of ability.

Is it hard go suck a chrono?
---
This is possible, but it feels unlikely. that_shaman lists any upcoming items that appear to be of interest and then the community crowdsources the search for things that don't turn up as a drop.
---
Jahai Bluffs was better than Thunderhead Keep so.............
---
Some dungeons are soloable, but given your current skill and understanding of the game, I'd say that's not worth doing right now. Soloing dungeons is usually done by people who want a challenge.
---
Just be patient re. finding a group, or have friends come play with you.
---
If you read the post you would have noticed that people (and mods) are aware of ArcDPS and Taco being closed source. They also said that both of the respective devs had been longstanding members of the community, whereas this guy had a brand new reddit Account and was also otherwise unheard of. I am sure you are familiar with the concept of reputation, so this really shouldnt be a big deal.
---
When you suck a chrono, you think you're gonna get quickness, but get fury instead? Sounds accurate.
---
I felt lucky earning *The Ascension* two years ago having received only two personal death threats.  I can handle the insults, but the sheer number of people that gg and quit after one minute was too high to have any fun.
---
You just keep sucking and sucking, and the well never ends.
---
Changed out to Signet of Malice like you and CronosDage said.
---
I also switched out Bandit Defense for Assassin's Signet. Holy crap night and Day. WAY more damage now. Cutting through Vet's like butter. Even better than my Dragonhunter does (about like using Spear of Justice, Stand your Ground and Dragon's Maw all together). WOW!
---
Do you have any idea what my resting Critical chance should be ? It's at like 64% without food or anything else. Wonder how that affects everything.
---
I switched out to the dashing dodge as well. I like it much better so far. It removes conditions (like CronosDage said before) as well which is great. In Bitterfrost after you fight a group of mobs you are always semi-frozen and move so slow. One dodge and it's all clear and I can mount again. LOVE it!
---
I wish I would have known to go full Beserker. Ugh just crafted a whole set of Marauder. Now I see more damage = more healing.
---
Guess I'll just replace each exotic piece slowly with ascended Beserker's or if I make some more gold I'll craft exotic beserkers.
---
One ring and one earring is valk-beserkers. Thank goodness the earring is the Black-ice one and not the Petrified wood. Although those two items might not make a difference.
---
My Power went up to 2,628 from 2,448 with the assassin's signet.
---
Don't really have a stun break now. Any advice on that front ?
---
Here are the new skills and spec.. Will have to work on gear slowly as gold comes. lemme know what you think.
---
You too CronosDage.
---
Obviously, that's the easy part. The hard part is updating it everywhere -- especially with your contacts.
---
Wouldn't less damage mean less healing ? I'll have to try both out.
---
I hadn't notice skills being on cool down a problem like say on a necro. I'll pay more attention to that. Thanks for the tip!

At least at a first glance, some source code was just added a few minutes ago to the github repo.
---
Thanks for head up! 
---
Guy makes d3d translator to d3d12. 
---

---

---

---
Alarms raised.
---
Reddit monkeys fire insults.
---
Guy gets defensive.
---
Mods lock thread.
---
Another guy actually check network activity and analyzes in IDA. Finds nothing malicious so far.
---
Here we are. Oh and there's source: https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy
---
&gt; Based on the existence of the public visible .dll people though the tool was suspicious and requested the programs source code to ensure there is no malicious code.
---
To be fair there were plenty of people pointing out the shadiness even before that, since the OP refused to give the source and really came with bad excuses for not doing so. The dll was actually found quite a bit later, and when asked about that he got super defensive (once again) for no apparent reason, instead of just explaining why it was there in a calm, collected manner. 
---
Thank you! 
---
So I'm supposed to have a separate email for every game I play and every online service I use? I'd have like a hundred of them then and that'd kind of be massively inconvenient...
---
Yup
---
&gt; Yeah, everything indicates towards the other OP just being a shitty dev with good intentions but poor awareness rather than someone actually malicious. 
---
Yeah, I interpreted the whole thing as someone with more programming skills than social skills who didn't expect it to be held up to any kind of critical review and didn't realize that being open was the best way to combat suspicion. 
---
ArcDPS, skse, nvse and a load of modding and addon programs for various games are often released closed source, so I can understand their reluctance, but the *why are these peasants questioning my glory?* attitude was very suspicious. 
---
&gt; Chances are the telemetry library is part of that messy code that he was using for his own debugging or to create local logs in case people had bugs to report so they could send him something useful.
---
Except we don't know that because we don't have access to the code to be sure and the OP got extremely defensive when people asked to see the source just to know how safe it was to use (and for me it's not just about computer security but also overall stability as it seems some performance gains come simply from removing some safeguards).
---
Then again, maybe there is nothing wrong and it's just a big misunderstanding but then it's more of a communication issue and OP not realizing that people might not be confortable just running stuff that come directly from a Github release section with no source available to check if the code was not doing anything weird and if the generated binary was consistent with the provided source.
---
&gt;I think he was getting sick of people asking the same thing over and over 
---
Reddit has unfortunately a tendency to over-react and blow some stuff out of proportion but I think it's fair from people to ask repeatedly for source after quite a few red flags had been raised. While I can feel OP for their initial reaction (eg. "I think my code is trash" because EVERYBODY who has ever done code at some point felt that way) they probably should have understood the reasons people had for asking source.
---
From what I saw most of the exchange unfolded like this: 
---
&gt;Reddit User: Hey can we see the source
---
&gt;OP: Sorry tbf the code is not ready for public view because I think it's not well written
---
&gt;Reddit User: hey there is this stuff that may look a bit weird on top of those other weird things, it would really help clear things out if you released the source
---
&gt;OP: Why are you so suspicious? Are you trying to hide something by asking the source?
---
&gt; *classic Reddit escalation of people shouting at each other*
---
&gt;Now we may never see the final product with a (from the dev's POV) thankless reaction like this.
---
Releasing the source could have solved this issue right away: people could have looked at it to assess what it was and was not doing while also maybe providing improvements to it. Again I think it's all a mix of Reddit escalation + OP not realizing why it mattered so much that we could see the source with all the red flags (new Reddit account + 7 y/o Github account with 0 activity until last month did not help).
---
Also watch out for recruiting guilds in map chat - a good place to come across one of them is in populated places like Lion's Arch. 
---
We fought them 13 times yesterday and they never failed to switch platforms. She did get an occasional breakbar though once invincible at 25% which then disappeared after a second. Maybe her abilities stall her at the platform if her phase and her abilities coincide very oddly.
---
Sometimes people say usefull stuff in team chat so i don't like a special pvp chat tab.
---
I just block everyone as soon as they afk or trash talk doesn't matter who it's directed to.

Well that's about the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Were you not around for heartbleed?

One pretty famous and recent legend is "Commodore Cobiah Marriner", basically the one who made Lion's Arch what is today, repel the invasion from the undead, and declare Lion's Arch indipendency from Kryta. You can find more details in the Marriner Plaques around Lion's Arch, the wiki, or the books.  
---
It seems a fitting Revenant Legend for using an offhand pistol or a rifle.

Everyone speaks of DX12 as the be all end all of game enhancement.   Putting jet fuel in a Jetta won't make it faster becuase the engine that's burning the high octane gas is shit in the first place.

These kind of items get manually checked on Anets side and passed through if acceptable.

An Legendary is worth quite a lot from a goldseller perspective.
---
Now I have to imagine that this joke is actually told by the Krait.
---
I mean, we were on discord when he sended me the item + I have the record of him sending  all the legendary items he bought for the guild
---
Those would be perfect places to hide a trojan.  Outside GW2 things like UBlock Origin or a Discord Bot Verification bot.

Anything you can't full vet the code should never be trusted 100%.  Many things I trust 99.999% but that .001 is always there and should be for anyone using a phone, computer, tablet or similar device.

1) there is a cave next to the first one under a hill next to that one, from there you can swim through a waterway and the other poi you can get by jumping on those gear things, its the start of a quite difficult jumping puzzle. Also all Core and HoT maps are completly doable without mounts
---
2) You can reskill at any time at no cost.
---
3) the only way to upgrade are Sigils, you will see them more on weapons the higher level you are. I dont think you need to have weapons always on your level, if you want though and have no luck getting the from drops you can buy them from the tp for not top much money. Id recommend that only at lvl 60/80 though.
---
4) id stay keep the mats but its your chooce, can still buy the later.
---
5) play the game however you enjoy it!
---
Hope that helps a bit. 
---
&gt; so far the only place where we find norn are in the Shiverpeaks...
---
that would be ignoring any norn that love being pirates in LA or any that move beyond the shiverpeaks to build their legend in what ever form that might take.. Thats not even taking into account norn that have joined any of the orders and you see every step of way in the fight against elder dragons. They might be easy to miss as they are just taller humans but they exist.
---
&gt; What do you think about that?
---
Personally I think this would be a bit too much. So far corruption only happened with a main body that this main body can take over the corrupted beings. That Aurene would brand Kralkatorrik and take him over because of it sounds out of line.
---
ArenaNet hinted at plot points in previous episodes before like use of flames or references to Balthazar before we even knew that wannabe Lazarus was in fact Balthazar. In the Episode itself, at the trails, Glint is talking to Aurene about ascension. I do think that the upcoming episode has something to do with this and that Aurene simply sacrificed her mortal Body to protect us, her champion, and ascend or gain the knowledge of ascension and travel to the mist in which all of this doesn't affect her.
---
But even that is a bit of a stretch and only because it was hinted at in a conversation...
---
&gt;they probably should have understood the reasons people had for asking source.
---
They did, and said they would, just not today, and said that they respected people's decision to not use it in the interim. It all seemed very cordial and not "extremely defensive" until it spiraled out later on.
---
Legal in Cantha!
---
you forgot bgdm from back in the day we had a good dps meter
---
I love what the griffon brought to the game. Also FFS dude. Is it even legal to have that much control over your griffon?
---
It's now moved south of Pearl Islet Waypoint in Southsun Cove.
---
[&amp;BNUGAAA=]
---
can't find it either
---
Existence is Pain for the Ranger.
---
yeah just sad that most of reddit happily over escalated and hopped on the hate train even tho its was functional code, other tools like taco don't have source as well

*slow clap*

&gt;Kessex Toxic Alchemist PoI
---
The PoI you're looking for is [Togatl Grounds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Togatl_Grounds) (link goes to wiki) and the cave entry is a bit further that you thought you need to enter an underwater tunnel from somewhere around the heart NPC that is West/South-West from the PoI you want.
---
&gt;Kessex Sewer PoI
---
The core GW2 map can be 100% completed without any expansion. For the detaisl about this PoI I'm afraid I'm not sure which one you are talking about right now, can you give me a landmark close by and a direction (like West of this PoI/Waypoint/Vista/Heart/etc)?
---
&gt; Map chat and whispers
---
Here is a link to the [restrictions for a F2P account](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account#Free_accounts) (link goes to wiki). For chat it means you may
---
* Not use map chat, only "say" chat
---
* Only whisper mutual friends or people on your map (so maybe they changed map at some point?)
---
&gt;Skill point distribution
---
When you reach level 80, even if you did 0 Hero challenge, you will have unlocked every skill and trait lines of your core profession and will be able to change then at will as long as you are out of combat.
---
If you want to see all the skill in action you may also go the the [PvP Lobby](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_Mists) (also called Heat of the Mists) here you will behave as if you were level 80 with everything unlocked (even elite specs if you had an expansion) and you can test skills and traits on golems and some NPCs.
---
&gt;Upgrade weapons
---
You can add stuff to you weapons/armor pieces/trinkets that are called [Upgrade components](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Upgrade_component). However while you are leveling there is not much point in going an extra mile to craft/buy a new weapon to match your level or get a new sigil on it because it may be a bit expensive for the gold you're currently making and it will become obselete pretty fast. So my advice is: go with what you loot until you get to level 80 then you can look at getting a nicer/longer-term gear.
---
Also worth mentioning there isn't really "elemental damage" in GW2 the upgrades that have "of air"or "of fire" on them (for example) don't really produce a "fire" or "lightning" type of damage. They do heave a special way of working, sigil of fire creates a small area attack while sigil of air is single target but more powerful, and can create "themed" death animations (mob body dropping dead from an electrocution or looking like it got burned).
---
&gt; Materials
---
Stocking up materials is usually a good idea unless you specifically are doing a farm to get a bunch of material X just to sell it of course. It's always nice to have a reserve of mats because it will often lower a lot of your cost when you try to level up a crafting profession or craft sutff once you are at level 80 (while it's not mandatory at all to use crafting it can cut the prices of some things by quite a lot compared to the Trading Post). Then selling some materials is also a quick way to make some gold if you ever need it.
---
You can use the [Deposite Material](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Inventory#Options_button) option in your inventory to put them in a special kind of collection in your bank where you can stock up to 250 of each material (by default number can be increased with gem store).
---
So by default I would tell you just use Deposit Materials all the time and only begin to sell a material once it start to overflow in your inventory because you material storage is full (which will probably not happen that a lot before you reach level 80)
---
&gt;Level 80
---
Honestly? You do you. Are you having fun doing what you are doing right now? If yes then just keep doing it and enjoying the game the way you do.
---
I think the main reason people tell you that is because at level 80 you get access to a lot more content and possibilities, some (most?) of which are tied to expansions. However if you are having fun doing exploration, doing the story when you want, trying to do some collection then just keep doing that, level 80 will come by itself and you will never feel like you actually went grinding XP just for the sake of XP.
---
&gt;they fill me with so much information so fast that I always forget what they say
---
This reply will probably not help on this matter but tbf you asked quite a few questions :p
---
Fuck off man, an unknown new account with 0 github activity posting a closed source program with telemetry included isn't in the same galaxy as the arcdps situation. This isn't "just reddit for you", it's just standard reaction to people offering miracle software on the internet.
---
I don't see the story improving if we're adding characters just to fill a quota. Sry I don't agree with willy nilly including random people just cuz
---
Easy. He should send his code to an Anet dev.  
---
If they say it is ok. Fine. On the other side I hope he doesn't, anyone from Anet saw this and is like "oh, he did that on his own, why the fuck cant we do it?" and then develop it.... the same that happened with build templates... uhhh, oh. I see the flaw in my logic there....
---
You maybe want to check your spelling dude...
---
i love this, so simple so awesome
---
So basically just reddit being retarded as always.
---
my hands are not in your pockets, how retarded can one be wtf
---
I didn't get the reward from the Storm Elemental. Does this mean I STILL can't finish the achivement?!
---
It's already past location change time, so they've moved:
---
Soup vendor: Mount Maelstrom (Bard's Waypoint)
---
Oil vendor: Southsun Cove (Pearl Islet Waypoint)
---
Because they changed how SOI works :D
---
&gt; Well some users weren't really all that nice as well towards him...
---
Mate, this is the internet, there are non-nice people everywhere. If the telemetry stuff really wasn't malicious, they could've started with saying that, instead of saying "it's useful you dumbo i don't need to explain shit" (paraphrased, but still).
---
&gt; can't go anywhere 
---
Remains to be seen if that's true of if that's just Kralk being lazy
---
There's frequent duelling near anza and near QL on EU servers. As far as I have seen, you have no clue what actually happens in WvW. 
---
SKRRRA
---
Was that fixed already? Because two days ago i only got 15 VM per chest which is a nerf.
---
&gt; You're doing it again!
---
You mean I'm doing what I said I am doing? Calling you an elitist asshole? Yes, that's what I'm doing. Because you are. But that is beside the point. I also have no intention of stopping. Because you are an elitist asshole and you also have no intention of stopping that.
---
&gt;The more you ask for source the more you get shady
---
Right, that's exactly how that works. Good job on catching that guy early and thanks to all the people who know enough stuff about coding to confront the guy, who knows what he would've done with all the hacked accounts.
---
I will attach link to this comment on github. Thx.
---
you sound fun
---
GW2 is a casual singleplayer game. Interaction is limited to pressing buttons in the general vicinity of other player characters. This is done to avoid toxicity or otherwise negative experiences. 
---
Chat only exists to RP and for elitists to tell you how to play the game. You should mute it all together. Teamchat and mapchats are particularly awful. 
---
To make friends, you can simply follow a player around. Whenever someone has a coloured dorito above their head, that means they're looking for friends to have a party. You can join them, but you shouldn't talk to them. 
---
Shit, that's some tight UV mapping though 
---
You could claim Aurene comes back as theory 1 and Aurene does not come back as theory 2, and then you'll be able to arrogantly mock people for always coming back to the same two theories :p
---
&gt;It's sometimes hard to pinpoint whether it's you who sucks or your team is a bunch of clowns
---
If you can't tell which, it's most likely both. 
---
this part of the code is common to generate log files you can see it for yourself in the source
---
/r/suddenlytrans
---
&gt;  Asura and Sylvari home = Maguuma.
---
 
---
Also note that the Sylvari Home Instance is really more troublesome to navigate in than the Asura's one, so if you're looking for a quick instance farm, you'd rather choose the Rata Sum one.
---
When I read the comments the "I will put the source later because it's late" came very late in the discussions and a bit too late imo after a lot of of flags had already been raised while OP explanations looked dodgy at best from my PoV. Then again I agree that the tendency to blow stuff out of proportion from some people here did not help at all.
---
You forget the 15% fees, but ~25s per 1g is still nice.
---
&gt;Note: If you are a regular player, I believe you already know what I'm talking about. If you insist on hard evidence anyway, here you go: Raids, WvW, PvP, Fractals. (Compare percentages. Also, 500+ hours usually draws a better picture.)
---
I think something that is important to keep in mind here is how large part of those player bases actually uses GW2Efficency?
---
I see very little reason for someone that plays only PvP or only WvW to actually bother with an account there, since it doesn't really give them much. Therefore those numbers are probably quite pointless.
---
&gt;Every update brings weapon and armor skins, but they are accessible through Black Lion Chest and Gem Store only.
---
We literally got two full weapon sets achieveble in game in the latest big update.
---
And the big update before that we got a 6 full armor sets....
---
You start breaking even around 850%
---
I have the same opinion on guilds since release to this day. it should have been like GW1. Not being able to join 500 guilds, guild hoppers were the scum of the community and GvG complete with guild grinds to get a guild hall going (which was the map of the GvG) and alliances. I personally don't see how the current system is in any way better than what GW1 originally had. It doesn't promote community, it doesn't make you invest into any sort of reputation nor does it provide any meaningful content (g missions lmao).   
---
The game is called Guild Wars 2 yet it has no Guild Wars :)
---
Just standard sound sadly 
---
Cookie cutter response but I log in, do what I want to do for however many hours, and log out. What I want to do typically doesn't involve gathering routes and farming home nodes on 10 different characters.
---
I don't judge anyone but personally I could never understand why you'd turn a game into a second job. It's sad to me to see people saying "I do this, this and this and then have X time left to do what I want". 
---
I like gold as much as the next guy but I'd rather it took me a couple more weeks to get that legendary if it meant I acquired the gold doing things I actually enjoyed.

RemindMe! 5 hours

One utility option I haven't seen mentioned here yet is Haste over Bandit's Defense. It is similar to activating Assassin's signet, but I find 6 seconds of Quickness significantly nicer in open world than the added power. You can also use it as a stunbreak if you are in a longer fight and don't use it burst the enemy down instantly.
---
I personally prefer using Deadly Arts over Trickery as I don't make use of the extra initiative and everything that is not a champion dies pretty much instantly. Not sure how well that works with your cheap rune choice. It's up to you what you like more.
---
A very nice way to instantly destroy an enemy is to dodge (Bound), steal mid-dodge (it will hit), use Haste and finish it with Weakening Charges. 
---
Vault is a neat skill, but keep in mind that it's not the highest damage per second skill unless used against 5 enemies. Don't fall into the trap of Vaulting all the time, only use it when you need the evade (careful, not the full cast of it is evaded) or when there enough enemies to hit with it (4-5).
---
Another skill that is more useful in open world is Dust Strike. Blindness on demand can be extremely effective against most foes that don't have a defiance bar and attack slowly or have a big strong attack.
---
Signet of Agility is also great when used, extra 2 dodges and 3 conditions cleaned, for up to 5 people around you.
---
One thing I see daredevils not doing enough is cleaving multiple enemies when they can. You can often stand between two enemies a bit apart from each other and hit both with your autoattacks and dodges.
---
And one last thing I'd recommend is to change things defending on what you are going to fight. Sometimes ranged pistols are incredibly effective, or at least opening with Unload to get some might for a longer fight. Sometimes you may want extra blocks, sometimes even stealth is useful (don't forget to take Revealed Training then). If you need CC and you are alone, the daredevil elite is definitely the way to go (unless you need a really long evade). If there are multiple people around, Basilisk Venom is the way to go. Thieves guild is not particularly great, the damage increase is not that big, CC usually gives you much more. If extra evades are needed, there are utility skills (and dagger storm) for that. You can change the heal skill depending on whether you want passive healing or an active heal here and there. You could even take Withdraw if you need even more evades.
---
I also see that you don't have any food listed there, there are multiple very cheap (&lt;5s for 30 minutes) and efficient options if you want that.
---
- Plate of Orrian Steak Frittes (+100 Power, 70 Vitality - but you already have more than enough vitality)
---
- Soul Pastry (+100 concentration (extra 0.4s of quickness from Haste), +70 power)
---
For utilities, the one and obvious cheap choice is the
---
- Potent Superior Sharpening Stone

Well every Home Instance is more troublesome than Rata Sum, but the Sylvari Home is just not worth using. 
---
woooomp
---
It's their fault for dodging your wells don't worry.
---
Never trust anyone who develops 3rd party tools without a source code. Never modify or alter or read game files/memory/usage any way.
---
Iirc thery added a guaranteed green uni in each chest. Right now you get as much out of pala as before the update (less VM but more uni to sell/open) but hopefully the prices of uni and trophies will rise up and make it more profitable.
---
Wait, you get 2g for killing Tequatl once a day?
---
Well, duh, not everyone wants SMS messages, they want to use authentication application instead and I can see there is no option for that on the launcher.
---
Sorry but I'm the consumer, not a developer. I care about this game but I'm not obliged to fix it. And you are right, leaving is a good option. 
---
1. Farm Guild Hall &amp; Home Instance.
---
2. Craft daily legendary mats: Spool of Silk Weaving Thread, Spool of Thick Elonian Cord, Lump of Mithrillium, and Glob of Elder Spirit Residue. Bonus points: things like Plate of Piquant Plant Food.
---
3. Use your converters: Ley-Energy Matter Converter, Gleam of Sentience, Mawdrey II, Princess, Herta, Spearmashal's Plea, etc.
---
4. Do your dailies (3).
---
5. Do your 3 daily fractals and 3 recommended fractals. Also buy 30 discounted encryption keys.
---
6. Do a Ley-Line Anomaly for that Mystic Coin.
---
7. Do any easy festival dailies (e.g. Lunar New Year right now).
---
8. Farming S3 maps:
---
&gt; Bloodstone Fen: Easy 10 UM balls and 5 flying skill usage dailies.
---
&gt; Lake Doric: 5-10 minutes to farm all the Jade Fragments. Get the peach and 10 UM balls in the north. 2 dailies.
---
&gt; Siren's Landing: 10 minutes to farm 5-8 pearls and lots of wood. Sometimes you get an easy daily (wave to Willow / 10 UM balls / farm pearls).
---
&gt; Bitterfrost Frontier: Farm all the berries. Easy dailies: 10 UM balls, defend a beacon, and farm 6 winterberries. Don't forget to grab special chests on your way (look up where veteran Jotun and that "secret door" to the north side is) for UM. Also don't forget to farm the easy corrals under the lake.
---
8. Farm S4 maps:
---
&gt; I haven't started doing this yet. But I am sure someone else covered this.
---
10. Park level 80 alts at nice chests at end of JP for daily chest farms.
---
11. Park alts at nice mat gathering places, like flax farms in DM.
---
Do people screenshot other players that frequently? I sometimes alt tab out of the game then come back to it only to see someone circling around me weirdly like they set it up to make screenies. I sometimes awkwardly move away a bit to see if they follow and they do. I lot of times I wonder how many people possibly made screenshots of my characters lol. It kinda feels weird, but in a good way. But maybe they screenshot in a "look at this ridiculous bullshit" way :D

Heard it can be a bit of a mouthful...

Personally, because a lot of it is just bad. But since a large majority is bad I don't mind applying the filter. The few good ones posted a year aren't too big of a loss and all the gw2 artists I actually like I already follow on their relevant sites.   
---
I don't mind art clogging up my front pages, i do mind bad or low effort art tho.

"Hey, I made an external tool that changes the very foundations of the game engine"
---
Anybody who used that is a moron, if we're being honest.
---
Well to be honest, I would prefer no crashes and lower FPS than some crashes and higher FPS. 
---
But well, everything has its own evolution, even computer programs, and different people can bring in different ideas. Even if this would be crashing a lot, proof of concept is good start to make things better. 
---
Maybe Anet has good stats about their users, if they see that majority of people have still win7, they don't see the urge to do such, as it would not have any effect on those users (and those with older computers and thus lower FPS would use such optimization in the first place, while they can't because they are stuck on unsupported 10 years old OS)...
---
Let's hope that it will turn out to be usable and helpful :)
---
I liked it in 2012 for what it's worth. But gw2 pvp was a very different game back then. 
---
It does not matter what it sounds or looks or smells like for a redditor, If your friend was going to send you something and you did not receive, there is a chance he miss-typed your name, item went to a different account, or is still in his inventory (due to wrong address).
---
So ask **your friend to make a ticket**, in case if item went a wrong way.
---
Contacting support from your account will not lead to anything.
---
that's not true, nutmeg and apple are from 1 heart vendor in gendarran and ginger is from the chef npc in major hubs
---
that's hardly "all over tyria"
---
OP is not sender, op can not tell anet any details. Sender should be the one contacting support.

This was Elaborate Voicemail Hoax version of Noxxi
---
but you can't unlock a rev 2nd time and if you did not buy hot while watching the guide, i have no words left for you
---
Looks like many people had this problem since last patch on different member of Destiny Edge...
---
They were designed for both, it's just that PvE has evolved to ignore huge aspects of the combat system, mostly because almost all utility becomes useless if you use your active defenses (dodges, etc) appropriately. 
---
Utility such as boonstrip, condi manipulation (transfer, cleanse, ...), soft CC, reliability of skills (how difficult it is to land skills), abusing range, mobility or kiting, defensive stats and traitlines, all has almost no value in PvE. These things exist, but they're virtually never required. 
---
While some aspects were never "big", others are the result of nerfs. For example, condi pressure in orr was quite real at the start of the game. Nowadays, condi pressure in PvE is limited to a few fractals and raid bosses. 
---
It's because all these aspects of gameplay hold no value that you get a strong distinction between "pve" and "pvp" weapons (and classes, elite specs, traitlines, ...). To some extent this is OK. However for elite specs in particular, it's very possible for anet to balance between this. 
---
I'll give the simple example of scourge / necro because it's a very obvious one. It's a spec that has always been strong in PvP and weak in PvE with lots of memes as a result. PvE necros upset, PvP players upset with necros, lots of arguments between the two because of these different perspectives. 
---
Yet you CAN balance this. You simply move some of its power budget from the "utility" which is mostly valued in PvP towards aspects that are more valuable for PvE in comparison, such as DPS. You can even make this "DPS" which is difficult to land on players in PvP in various ways, as it's generally "easy" to land your skills in PvE in comparison. 
---
Unfortunately anet still regularly ignores this entirely. And so does the community. E.g. : things like AoE corrupts on every single punishment (utility) skill, cripple on every single shade cast. Patches which increase the corrupts necro pumps out massively without increasing its damage or utility in PvE much at all such as devouring darkness. 
---
These things increase the difference in effectiveness between PvP and PvE and thus drive the class away from being balanced for both. It's then generally balanced for the mode in which the spec overperforms (which is bad for players who enjoy the spec in other modes); or it's left to fully dominate a certain mode (which is bad for all competing specs which get pushed out).
---
**The effect of this "bad balancing" is that it makes the idea of playing whichever spec you like wherever you like a lot more difficult. Which creates even more disagreements.** 
---
For a while during HoT I thought anet grasped this. Then PoF came out and ignored it completely, but I felt they were simply pushing "PvE" and "PvP" specs as you mentioned (i.e scourge, fb, spellbreaker as PvP gods, specs like weaver as PvE gods). This would be OK, but in hindsight it appeared to be the result of blatant powercreep and slapping utility on every skill more than anything. I believe this to be the case because they then tried to balance the elite specs for all three modes during the first months of PoF. For a while, I thought anet grasped the concepts required to go towards a more balanced gamestate overall. The delay &amp; warning on shade skills is a good example. 
---
Then 6 months into PoF, they threw everything out of the window and balancing went full-random focussing on one aspect of the game for one class (i.e. weaver in raids, chrono in raids, ...). This is fine. The issue is that they neglected the impact it has on the other modes entirely. That's pretty bad. 
---
Consequently this lack of apparant vision is why I (and plenty of others) simply don't have much faith in anet's balancing anymore. And why i'd like to see basic reasonings for balance changes. 
---
e.g. I understand the idea of giving FB a tool to seed quickness to 10 players to compete with chrono. I also understand nerfing the tomes which are vastly stronger for pvp / wvw than they are for PvE. I don't understand the choice of SYG (a skill which has been META for the last 6+ years in WvW as it's the strongest stability option in the game, period) over alternatives such as retreat which is only a swiftness option and generally not used because heal mantra is so much more effective in providing aegis. (I've seen suggestions for elite shout but i wouldn't be suprised to see full dh / chrono comps with 1 quickness renegade and no requirement for "real" supports.) 
---
Check the trees in Kryta. Their rainbow bark is very very similar to a popular Reddit post around 2009-10 of trees with identical bark.

Part of growing up is realizing your favorite artists draw from the same er, pool of sources as you do.

the same who use arcdps, taco and dozen other tools which are still close source?

I made a wiki page, do you think they'll delete it?

Is playing a game / game mode for fun such an abstract concept that the only thing mentioned are always rewards? 
---
So I just screwed up and bought the wrong item not noticing that I can only buy one item from the vendor. I'm pissed at myself but whatever. What I do want to know is why there wasn't a warning pop-up, when one exists for buing fractal keys of all things that you can only "buy 30 for lowered price"?

The pun is intended, but I also like the way how you can interpret it in 4 different ways depending on how you split the two words

What do you recommend for a lazy bum like me, who just wants to right click a salvage kit and salvage whole sgtacks? masterwork and lower -&gt; copper, rare -&gt; silver, cheap exo -&gt; rune and exo with good upgrades blk?
---
There are actually some good arguments for why you shouldn't pay much heed to new accounts. If someone is not willing to put their reputation on the line over what they are saying, why should anyone else waste time parsing the validity of what they are saying?
---
Modern discourse requires some assumptions about the good faith intentions of the participants and those assumptions tend to quickly go out the window once someone decides that maintaining their reputation is no longer a relevant factor for their half of the conversation.
---
It's fine, we love red flags here. :D
---
&gt; This is what happens when people trust 3rd party applications. 
---
nothing happened 
---
You have some valid points there but I disagree with some of them.  
---
&gt;The difference is the amount of information. ArcDPS is closed source but it doesn't promise you the stars.
---
When I first heard about the possibility to check others people gear and traits and see even their dps, I couldn't belive it. Since I didn't expected that the Server would exposue such information to the client.  
---
&gt; Then others have said that the russian language turned them down which IMO isn't such a big deal but a lot of malware is coming from russia so the reservation towards this is justified.
---
If this statement would be made in a polical context people would call you racist:
---
A lot of x is comming from y people so the reservation towards this is justified. Where x is something bad and y is a country.  
---
&gt;I'm sorry but this is like saying "Why am I get a ticket for driving too fast because everyone else is driving too fast".
---
Yes ofc. This should make people aware that every day you use your PC you need to trust a lot of companies and people whose software and hardware you use. It should point out that when using closed source software and hardware you need to trust the publisher.
---
So this is why I think it is totally okay if you don't trust this guy because:  
---
-He is new and his tool is new  
---
-The overall context seem to shady for you  
---
But I think it is not okay to distrust him because:  
---
-He is russian

-He uses P7 for logging (as u said he might be used to this library)  
---
-He dosn't want to disclosure his source code

This gave me a good laugh, thanks man &lt;3
---
14 matches, one leaver spotted. It has been pretty fun up to this point on my Spellbreaker. No one added on blocklist. Yet.
---
I sure do hope, that there is some kind of a punishment system for players that leave matches or AFK the whole match.
---
don't craft exotic armor it's most of the time more expensive than buying
---
for berserker search for "nika's" on the trading post
---
also invigorating precision is amazing but it's afterall a crutch so if you're serious about doing stuff like fractals or raids you should get used to survive without it
---
I'd even pay for the chance to replay that story. Joined the game shortly after it ended, and didn't even know there was something like this happening, as I was slowly exping in the north... 
---
I came her to write "boooop" as a joke, but... I see I'm late.
---
You may check Dulfy, you can find a video there to hear the sound.
---
&gt; I will gladly apologize and I think a lot of other people here will do
---
I don't have a single doubt you guys will apologize if that's the case, but let's be honest...most people here won't.
---
RemindMe! 8 hours
---
The one I'm currently in I found in the old gwguru forum, and I'm in this guild for almost 9 years now.
---
In other words, forums is a good place to find guilds, visit their sites and check if their "game philosophy" is similar to yours. 
---
&gt; Do you think a single fucking guy with a couple .dll files can make a game work on a new bloody graphics API?

Yes:

Just play PowerChrono
---
Me no smart
---
Historically for the Gw2 community, yes. In fact the need to grind things is why we have grind maps like Silverwaste/ Palawadan. Its why we even have ascended gear in the first place, why fractals exist more for loot than lore (though they do combine both).
---
Not that you can't do any of those things for the fun of it, and there is nothing wrong with wanted to be rewarded for your time spent doing anything. The thing is many people just can't free themselves from the skinner-box line of thinking.
---
Its usually when people leave and try another game that actually come to appreciate the kind of game that Gw2 is. Gw2 offers so much crap that people take for granted its hilarious.
---
Yeah, let's just hate on people who want engine upgrades done to this game so it works better on more modern hardware.
---
Yep I always do original zone gatherer/lumberer/miner in my home instance. Good way to make sure you remember to do it daily. 
---
Orr I used to do malchors but I've swapped to Siren's landing loads of trees right by entry point and harvester and miner just to the N. Invariably people will have left banners by the entry point as well. Free porting there if you have the scroll too. 
---
As mentioned by others HoT head to your GH. Fully upgraded gets it or across 2 GH of different node levels. 
---
Really maguma wastes is the only slightly more involved one and even that is pretty easy. 
---
I have this bug all the time, and I have been getting it ever since I installed gw2 hook 
---
It's been said over and over, it's not going to help but hey maybe bringing it up this time will make it magically happen...
---
Maguma Wastes Forager is super easy too, by just using the fiel in Dry Top. Others may be a bit more annoying, ye.
---
Authy or [WinAuth](https://winauth.github.io/winauth/index.html)
---
1g for the kill itself, 1g for opening the chest. (+Any loot you may get out of boxes)
---
the swim infusion is absolutely worth it
---
+12 is barely over 1g and it's there forever and it greatly helps whenever you are in combat underwater..or if super cheap +10 is also fine and worth having
---
How do you get those unid when you cannot open the chest after one round? 
---
Thanks :)
---
You're arguing in favor of ArenaNet's profits, the discussion is about making the game fun for us players.
---
Rift turned into such a shit show. I went back to it about 8 months ago and played for 6 months. After how much of a mess it was, I was looking for a game and came back to GW2 after 4 years away. I wish I had just played GW2 all the way through.
---
Reward and achievement is the pillar of an MMORPG, the problem are the people that want this game to be something else.
---
I can just imagine the price droping
---
Oh, I always ran away from it, because it's too loud.
---
Wow, you're not circle jerking or sucking the game's balls? Downvote for you.
---
Thats the only thing I hate about this community, people cant take a single bit of constructive criticism for the game, they'll act like 14 year olds and downvote you without giving any arguments back. Don't even bother, my man. 
---
I left Rift early on because I was looking for and wanted a game focused on the open world instead of instances. I found that here. Rift could have been that, but for two things.
---
They didn't abandon the quest hub leveling, even though they did have dynamic events. That is to say dynamic events were tacked on as an afterthought rather than basing the open world around them. I meant they didn't really chain, they didn't tell stories. They were mostly just thrown in their.
---
Rift had a currency called planarite, which is pretty much like Karma. I had completely maxed out my planarite, had already bought everything I could with it, and I was done. If I didn't raid or didn't want to run the gear treadmill, I had collections and that was about it. Not what I signed on for. 
---
Apparently a lot of people felt like me, because the forums was full of people complaining, enough so that Rift started coming out with smaller, more casual content, I think they might have been called Adventures, but because of the gear grind I was already overtuned for it, and they were worthless. 
---
At the end of the day Rift didn't hold my interest once I was leveled even the first time, so I left and never looked back.
---
This game has definitely had it's ups and downs, but when I try other games out there, I often find that this one still fits my play style best.
---
A player got the reddit in an uproar over a support issue, and Anet devs related to support/bans were getting called out/reddit linked in a bunch of threads. Players just wanted clarification and it took a day or two for Anet to form an official statement.
---
Chris Cleary deleted his reddit account during this time.
---
I mean, I just make a quick screengrab of outfits I like, and then when I want a new look for one of my characters I just browse through my random screengrabs folder till I find a good one to copy/adjust.
---
But yeah, I've noticed people circling around my characters sometimes too. Though when I do it I usually just try to hide it
---
Its fractals answer to everything, thats why its so profitable
---
You're missing the point. He means there's no achievement to be had in PvE, farming the shit out of yourself replaying a meta you dont have fun with only cause its profitable, so you can buy gems with the gold you make is NOT how PvE rewards should be implemented.
---
&gt; By design, ArenaNet is not at all motivated to keep players around in an endgame loop. That applies more to monthly subscription based MMOs where you want to lock players in for all eternity.
---
I find it rather concerning that you believe there is no reason for anet to have players log in and play repeatedly. It may not result in immediate SALES, but that neglects the long term value and income of the game. 
---
By not having sufficient means for players to stick around, you further ensure guilds, communities and so forth struggle to survive. As you say, there's no reason to continue to log in. The friends you make ingame quit. There's no reason to play together. Likewise no external content, content creators, and so forth. 
---
And this has a negative impact on a lot of the content which GW2 ALREADY invested in. Content which relies on guilds and communities for its ecosystem. Content which is MORE FUN even for solo players if they are supported by guilds and communities. 
---
The effect? It's harder for everyone, especially the casual player that logs in and wants to do what they feel like, to find an appropriate group and be able to do exactly that. And this quickly snowballs out of control with LFG's becoming entirely inactive, PvP queues and matchmaking becoming worse, servers turning out to be dead. Effects of an unhealthy ecosystem. 
---
Imagine you want to hop into a fractal, or raid, or WvW. You'd like there to be a commander or group that you can join and plug yourself into. Having MORE PLAYERS actively playing the game is a benefit and makes the game more enjoyable for EVERYONE. There is a reason people regularly come to a subreddit and ask if a game is "alive", "healthy", "populated", "still played", ... Yet here you are telling me there is no incentive for anet to keep players around past their initial purchases. 
---
Keep in mind everything I mentioned are investments that anet has ALREADY MADE. GW2 has already invested into guilds, guildhalls, WvW, PvP, raids, fractals and so forth. They are now ASSETS. Stuff that anet owns, that makes the game more fun, stuff that entices players to buy their game and spend money on it. You can have a healthy ecosystem and exploit these assets for years, hopefully even grow. Or you can have these assets drop like a rock like most videogame flops and singleplayer games, which forces you to invest into more content immediately for the next paycheck. 
---
The videogame has on marketing and barely any content creators. It has on repetitive content and clearly doesnt' need guilds or communities. How do we get fresh blood to buy the game, LS episodes, gemstore stuff, ... which is required for sustained sales?  Wait until other mmo's fuck up?
---
It's not terrible but it's not as good as people think except for bots and people running multiple accounts. It's hard to fit more than 4 matches into an hour, and unless you are winning literally every match , it will take AT LEAST 3 hours to get the 20g chest. More likely it will take 4 hours or so. So that's around 30 gold every 4 hours. Again, not terrible but not stunning.
---
Let me put it this way, you do not play to have gold, if you do change your mind. when you start doing T1 in your exotic gear, that you got from dungeons, you will start progressing towards T2, etc. You will get rings there and accessories from guild missions, and progress to T3.
---
When you salvage all your stuff, you will get material and start doing crafting, and you will slowly achieve full ascended.
---
When you finally progress to 100th fractal, you will be logging in to reply all your favorite stuff, and meet new people and share your experiences, doing daily fractals, world bosses, and other stuff like that.
---
Soon you will notice gold just gathering up in your wallet. But there will be no need for it at that point. Feel free to send some my way ;)
---
You don't. You run it once for the day and that's it.
---
eating all the boosters and going to silverwastes https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic_Find
---
No? 
---
PvP had no rewards for decades. WvW had no rewards until 3 years ago. Plenty of people played because they ENJOYED IT. 
---
It's only fashionwars2 that turned into fashiongrind2.
---
Oh nice thank you! I don't really mind if setting it up might take some time as long as I don't need to be alt tabbing all the time while I play
---
Tag *everything*, not just the champs. AoE and cleave are great for that. Most mobs drop greens or blues. 
---
There's a surprising amount of dead zones where I live. The cables are reliable and I don't need to be permanently available. When it's important, I'll get an email, or a good old phone call.
---
&gt;The reason why people leave for the same reasons as you mentioned is because they are all conditioned to the endless grind other games give to them over and over.
---
You confuse replayable content with grinding. 
---
Grinding is doing the same thing repeatedly to get to a reward (which makes you feel good). The other is repeating content because you enjoy the content regardless of rewards. Repeating content for other goals (improving, you enjoy it, it's diverse, ...) isn't exactly conditioned to an endless grind. Most players (more or less) want both. 
---
Imo OP is too focussed on rewards, but you do need to satisfy both ends to cater to a wide range of players (customers). 
---
You can grind istan for 10 hours to get a shiny and it's grinding. You can roleplay for 100 hours but if you're not getting any rewards for it other than your personal enjoyment while roleplaying, i wouldn't call it grinding.
---
Yea, except community and mods bullied them and put shit all over them without knowing what is what. Open source code is not a necessity to share stuff. 
---
WE BULLIED AND CLAIMED THEY ARE A HORRIBLE PERSON SO THEY RELEASED THEIR CODE PUBLICLY YEY. 
---
If you have many accounts 2FA is slow and clunky to get through with every one of them.

Would you mind sharing your script? I think quite a few people here would be very grateful or it (me included).

---
Well, it already happened, [4 years ago](https://www.pcgamesn.com/guild-wars-2/guild-wars-2-adds-sya-a-transgender-character-to-its-npc-ranks)
---
Will it get me more gold to use the music coins to craft those expensive skins and sell them, than just sell coins itself?
---
now THAT would be cool
---
Honestly it’s the opposite for me. Guild wars 2 is not a great single player game. In fact it has almost zero end game single player content, or money making.
---
That boss fight was so boring ;;
---
So what is this?
---
What does it look like? Giving the templates proper names is sorting enough imo. Scourge heal, Scourge power, Scourge condi etc.
---
You know who to pray to for. Praise him!

I'm guessing part of a collection that was never fully implemented. Possibly one of the Gen 2 legendaries that they turned into more generic creations. 
---
No.
---
You raising concerns is something, basically running a fear-mongering campaign vs the author and deleting his post and making a mod post about how his thing is shady and ppl should change their password asap etc is another.
---
So while you did nothing wrong, this post, /u/neok182 and a lot of the members in this thread are just disgusting people
---
People were suspicious since the original post was only binary with no source code included. Now that source is up we can examine it without using network monitoring. 
---
If you were asking what this tool is, just read the GitHub readme.
---
I suck at chrono too, but now that i've "volunteered" to do it for my static. i'm sorta stuck.
---
I feel your pain, my friend. 
---
One more couldn't hurt..
---
This essentially boosts your FPS if you are running Windows 10. The DirectX9 calls get translated into Directx12. 
---
It is too soon for me to suggest downloading it though, especially if you care about your computer's safety. With the source code released the community can dive deep into the program, see how it works, and if it would put your computer at risk.
---
May his bacon be ever lasting

Added a screenshot
---
I mostly use it to organize the templates into different gamemodes
---
"That's how it was in Guild Wars 1 and that's how it is here and it's what many of us prefer. It's the very reason why we're here."   
---
I'm pretty sure this was the case because there was very tangible endgame and it was PvP and GvG lol.   
---
"We worked for skins in Guild Wars 1 and we're happy to work for skins here too. You know, in Guild Wars 1, elite armor and max armor had the same stats exactly, even though elite armor was five times the price?  This is what the game was built around. It's not a flaw, it's a feature. You may not like it, and that's fine, but it's one of the main selling points of this game."  
---
I agree completely, so where are these rewards when the best looking stuff is in the cash shop? Legendary armor? kek Those rewards were a status symbol and hard to obtain, there's nothing like that in GW2 apart from legendary armour which is wildly disliked for being lower quality than gem shop items which is flat out insulting (not even mentioning WvW legendary not even having it's own skin).
---
I agree with your points but I am confused how you find everything in gw2 perfectly acceptable when they're an insult and a mere shadow of the same systems in gw1. What can I say, enjoy your fashion wars and casual open world fun I guess.
---
Holy that would be epic
---
I agree with everything you stated. In fact most of it is just history. I also agree many people WANT to grind, or enjoy quickly getting stuff short-term even if they don't enjoy a long-term grind game. 
---
But that doesn't mean anet hasn't fucked up designing around these (quite obvious) issues. Many of the issues are the result of anet simply not understanding their own playerbase. And when issues arise, they aren't aware of them anytime soon and certainly won't come up with solutions until the problem goes real bad. 
---
There is nothing wrong with having long-term goals to motivate people, like infusions. And if some people enjoy grinding for it, I don't care either. That's their choice, why not? But having some content be massively more rewarding than all alternatives makes it monotone and makes variety, by design, unviable for those that want rewards. And it decreases the relative income of all the less-rewarding content due to how the economy works. That's plain bad design. 
---
There's nothing wrong with good baseline rewards. But in adding baseline rewards they didn't have any rewards for actually trying to play the game, do well, and so forth. You get rewards for "showing up" rather than actually trying to play. If you give people baseline rewards for participating, then increase them for doing well (just like pretty much every job!) then you promote healthy gameplay. And if you get twice as much for just playing the game, I can assure you people won't afk as much. Yet if you have a bad day, or a bad game, you're still getting rewarded. 
---
I agree the population turned GW2 into a grind. But that's because the population is generally interested in short-term benefits rather than long-term enjoyment. Frankly, I expect devs to take in the demands of their players, process them and react appropriately. I don't think anet does this well (same is true for balance and design in general). It's sad to see the result it has on the game. 
---
it really annoys me that FF and ESO are getting praised and gw2 gets shit on for the exact same systems.
---
Blaaaaat 
---
It can get you more profit, depends on the weapon. Check gw2efficiency's crafting section, it will show you craftung prizes and estimated profit.
---
&gt;some sip
---
a giggle's a giggle mate
---
I cannot vouch for everyone. I do not run GW2 Natively, I run it through linux using wine. Wine 4.0 just came out with support for DX12. I hopped to the chance to test the tool, and I went from 30fps avg to 60avg. Also the camera stopped doing that stupid lag thing.
---
But I feel safe using a wine bottle, windows users might want to hold off on using the tool on their machine until it is confirmed safe.
---
It happened on Wednesday, with about 25 yesterday. It's not as bad as people think. I'm getting substantially more gold for UG than k did before, which compensates for the lower shipments. 
---
That's the art. I remember reading the books, exploring old LA, exploring new LA, and noting the differences between the depictions. 
---
Played a few dungeons yesterday, this occurs on other npcs as well
---
Ya it was supposed to drop from Shadow Behemoth, but their loot table was screwed up, and when they finally fixed it, it started dropping like it was supposed to. 
---
Deal; I have lost multiple accounts already. (Ones I purchased 'used' though, never one that I was the original owner of, so no hacking related losses whatsoever.)
---
it's always refreshing to read a comment from who actually have a clear idea about the game state
---
Before hoping this is legit people should really stop Upvote post for the tools when it comes out whitout knowing shit of what it is. Because what happened yesterday was just a sheep move.
---
People upvoting post without know what the fucks going on with the tools ---&gt; more people to download and install the tools without thinking if it was legit or not --&gt; more people to upvote the post. This is just an infinite pattern
---
When there are 3 builds, decent naming is enough. But I don't wanna hassle with 10 build templates so I might will definitely try this and see how it feels.
---
First and foremost: DONT FORGET TO BUY LUCKY ENVELOPES!! ITS FREE MONEY.
---
People usually buy 16 per day and keep them to open all at once on the final day with a ton of magic find % for massive profit. However this requires you to have like 224 gold. What you can do with 10 gold is buy 10, sell them on TP, get more than 10 gold back, then buy the rest, and repeat every day.
---
* 2 gold from dailies
---
* Gather all t3 materials from guild hall. You can also join a 2nd guild that has t2 materials and gather both!
---
* Can also find a few materials to pick up in wvw
---
* Since youre new, you can also ask if anyone with a "full home instance" to take you into his home instance and from there you can pick up all sorts of mats.
---
All these mats can be used, or sold for profit. it adds up nicely.
---
* Easy short dungeons can give you some nice gold, AC p1-2-3 can give you 50s per path + random loot +300 tokens that you can turn into gold
---
* T1 fractals is also profitable, even if you just do the dailies, and after some time and a few ascendant trinkets you will be able to do higher lvl fractals for more profit.
---
* Silverwaste farming where you instantly sell lvl 80 rares,greens and blues for 10-15 /1-3 silver on TP and open all loot bags on a lvl 50ish character is also very profitable
---
* Check gw2 efficiency and see which items you could craft and make a profit out of per day. Can also use its gathering feature and by WP and collecting thee most profitable 50 permanent gathering nodes you can get about 5 more gold per day
---
* Play the TP and win
---
* Gather "rarer" gathering nodes ,and use rare material boosters, (20% free one from guild hall!) lvl 80 orbs sell for 15-20 silver each for example
---
Just keep in mind that the incertitude for a new legendary greatsword is pretty big. We already got 3 legendary Greatsword so i dont see arenanet give us an other one
---
&gt; As for the developer, he really needs to check his ego 
---
As for community, in the words of great Noxxi, it has to "git gud" thing was posted with all the warnings and disclaimers but some members chose to go nuts about it, and community rolled with it.

The "most awesomest community" posts come from people who play open world. There is zero reason to be rude in this game mode because it is so not competitive. I mean most if not all events have a 100% success rate. As soon as you go into organized group content (fractals, raids) or competing vs other players (PvP or WvW) there is a significant chance that you might fail which brings out toxicity.
---
I lost it at, “necromancers romanticize necks”
---
I could have named 10 more sorted by spec and role but you get the concept. 
---
:D
---
I’m nervous to play ranked for this exact reason. So far, in maybe 30ish games of unranked, I’ve only experienced toxicity twice. The worst was from an actual guildie/teammate who would make terrible choices and then blame /me/ for their failure. I mean full out yelling in the mic level of toxic. According to them, we were losing the match because I wasn’t supporting them. No amount of support can help if you run straight into a team that is zerging on middle. Sorry. 
---
It got so bad that I didn’t play pvp again for a couple weeks. 
---
Second time was pretty recent and came from guy camping a capped point. He yelled at me for stopping for literally two seconds to glance at the map and decide where I was going to go next. The rest of the team stood up for me, which was really nice of them, honestly. 
---
I keep a stack of cookies in my inventory to sent to salty players, usually with a message like "Hey, you seemed upset. Here's some cookies to cheer you up"   
---
that either infuriates the player more or it helps relieving their anger.
---
You can't control other people's behavior, but sure as hell you can have fun with it. I just won a game where a salty player told us to "go play sims" and I found it hilarious. I obviously informed him that my sims are fabulous and he should feel ashamed by suggesting otherwise.  
---
P.S. Leage of Legends community forged my thick skin. You can't scratch it!
---
Just release it when it's cleaned up then?
---
Who cares about messy source code anyways? Only the coder.
---
&gt; guy's response was
---
his response/disclaimer was: "don't use it if you don't" 
---
and "source will be up when its ready"
---
everything else is the snowball effect 
---
No, i said el o el because of the last part "he would've done with all the hacked accounts." which is a huge problem and makes me laugh at this point. 
---
He could say he has a disorder that makes him unable to share his source code for all we know, closed source stuff is something people use all the time. Talking as if he is 100% hacking accs or whatever is simply wrong unless you have proof.
---
Being skeptical is right, not trusting is right too in this case, waiting for a code if you are not willing to risk is also right. It just is not right to talk as if he is after people's accounts just cause you don't know what is in it.
---
I hope i make some sense.
---
Not when he answered "I don't trust you" to people who just challenged him.
---
&gt;	The only way to be absolutely safe is to perform a clean install (as in nuke everything, reinstall your operating system with clean partitions) and only after that you change ALL passwords.
---
[Reminded me of this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbfMkh940Q)
---
Ah yes, my favourite class: Ranger... Who uses rev skills when created... With a thief build tree..
---
Yep, nothing wrong here xD
---
Both of those responses sound very defensive and suspicious. Everyone had every right to be concerned. 
---
&gt; Who cares about messy source code anyways? Only the coder.
---
And whoever has to read and maintain it.
---
Bringing up facts is going nuts? You should blame the gw2 mods for allowing people to post unchecked closed source projects and then making a sticky claiming it's a keylogger or whatever.
---
Yeah. If someone came up to you with a syringe promising that whatever's in it is some kind of panacea and will give you eternal youth, you wouldn't just let them inject it if they go "just trust me."
---
You'd distrust them, and possibly even call them insane. I know I would.
---
yes they had. but we are talking about raging with hot piss in here not the "being concerned" few.
---
&gt; Oh gosh, where to begin.
---
Formating.
---
I jumped to a - in my mind - fairly logical assumption. The thread title said it could contain malware. What type of malware profits from you having a certain game installed as prerequisite? A keylogger, for example. 
---
That was my thought process. Sure, it could just be harmless code, it could also just be some weird virus, malware or something else entirely, but when I read 
---
&gt; It may have contained malware. If you downloaded it, change your password and clean your computer.
---
my first assumption is that if the guy *is* doing something malicious, it's probably hacking accounts. Is that so weird? 
---
Yea and what is wrong with it? He got defensive and acted stupidly. It changes nothing. Are you paying him for this? You gonna make up for hours he spent on this for the community? Nah right. So he can be however he wants, and you can trust or distrust as much as you like.
---
If i shared something and ppl accused me of being a shady keylogger distributor out to get your accounts just because i don't wanna share my code i'd probably react in some stupid way and wouldn't keep my calm.
---
He even fuckin said it's late and he will go sleep. That is the right thing to do (see he calmed, made right decision) and people still shit on THAT too. He was told he is being too defensive...and offensive. Trying to calm? Also a red flag! EVERYTHING IS A RED FLAG!
---
"Nicest" community fucked up as far as "he is from x nationality, it is shady".
---
He wasn't shady, it's simply a language barrier.
---
But if alacrity is present i can try again earlier C:
---
I think you're entitled to your opinion, but you're one of the few people I've encountered who has expressed a preference for the new LA look.
---
I feel like the new LA looks like a theme park. The old LA was visually busy and messy and vertical, and all those things made it feel like a city. Thew new LA is sleek and empty and has ridiculous architecture, and that makes it feel like an attraction. 
---
I like it - breaks things into digestible chunks. 
---
You don't code then? A lot of ppl i know that do would care. People comment and judge your coding a lot and some ppl don't wanna hear any of it. It lowers the trust for sure, but that is all it does. It doesn't prove something is wrong which in this case was talked as if it does and people with 0 clue took it from there and ran ahead.
---
&gt; EVERYTHING IS A RED FLAG!
---
No, not everything, but sure keep telling yourself that.
---
IMO the best looking skins aren't from the gem shop. Only the obvious gliders.
---
And if you think the cash shop is what has the best skins, well you can grind for that too, without spending money.
---
I'm gonna try this.
---
But I'm afraid it won't work with reshade and arcdps buildtemplates. Then I have rather worse performance than a dull looking game.
---
THIS.
---
The Mystic coins was the most annoying thing to try to gather when crafting my legendary.
---
Maybe its just attention to detail as aurine did try to brand it seconds before she got obliterated...   
---
Same way about the detail about him missing his eye that we bashed moments before.
---
Personally i find all the theories amusing, and im not getting my hopes up for anything.
---
I do pay attention to details (such as taimi picking up zhaitans power before our 3rd strike, meaning he changed his "frequency" to that of zhaitan so the 3rd strike which was specifically attuned to klarkatorik frequency didnt had much of an impact.  
---
And i do have a few of my own theories what could happen next, but im just not looking too much into it :)
---
Requiem armor, elegy armor, dragonsblood weapons, astral weapons, stellar weapons, corsair armor, joko's staff, and all the backpieces from a few of the episodes this season. And all that is just what I remember off the top of my head for Season 4. Each of those sets takes you to a variety of places and content, often voice acted and meaningful content.
---
Chapter 1
---
I... I've read this... Now I feel as if... as if a 5 minutes of my life were foverer snatched from my life...
---
Chapter 2: slaves to Armok, the god of blood
---
It isn't entirely unsubstantial, but there is nothing original said there, so I someone wonders if he should read it -  don't.
---
&gt; Everyone had every right to be concerned. 
---
Absolutley 100% agree, however that does not make the way we as a community acted acceptable. I disagree on those being suspicious answers, he said he would put up source later and you can make your own decision to use the tool or not. All we had to do was wait patiently for them to put up the code, but instead became demanding and accusatory.
---
&gt; I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if the developer quickly ripped out the malicious aspects of the source code before posting it for review. 
---
Maybe? I would like to think not, either way run compiled clean source when it comes out and you still get what sounds like an amazing QoL improvement. 
---
It's not easy though. Speaking as a developer.
---
I **do** hope that if I ever do something like that, and if it happens that my binaries would be release-ready before my source code can be presented right away I'd be fair enough to openly state that I'll make another post when it's "properly ready" and for now people probably shouldn't download this unless they are feeling exceptionally brave. :(
---
Compile the source by yourself if you want to be sure
---
I think the creator is waiting for a mod response to make his own post again.
---
Wouldn't it be nice if we could just wait for that?..
---
You can also build it yourself using the source code. Although, you have to go through a few extra steps, since a part of it (the telemetry tracker) is missing. You have to find the source code for that somewhere else.
---
What keybinds do you use for your slot skills? Ironically my hands are so big I can't reach past 5 on the keyboard without moving my fingers off the movement keys, so I rebound 6-0 to QERFC, but I was wondering what you guys use to see if there's something better.
---
It can only be trusted if you can build the same thing from the source.
---
&gt; You should blame the gw2 mods for allowing people to post unchecked closed source projects
---
People shouldn't rely on mods to babysit their lack of common sense though. Don't run an unchecked code.
---
Exactly. Not hard to google translate a readme.. 
---
I was gonna write a post but read this and realise i had nothing else to add really. 
---
Some veterans players have a ridiculous expectations on the game (or any MMO really this is not only about GW2). 
---
If you are a veteran you played everything and then some. When new content comes you throw your self at it and finnish it in a few hours and are then unhappy. But that is not how the content is meant to be played at all, it is just the way that veterans play it because it is new and we have done everything else so we soak it up instantly, No company can fullfill veterans needs, it is simply the curse you need to deal with because they can not give out a new expansion every time there is a patch up. They simply add content that is enough for casual players or newer players who will pretty much spend weeks or months making it. 
---
Nice assumptions fam. 
---
I personally don't think so but I am personally tired of having the same armour set since release, meanwhile 10 new costumes in the store, 1 in-game (which looks like ass compared to the rest of the in game AND cash shop obtainable ones). Even if that weren't the case we get barely any costumes ever, a LARGE majority is going to the cash shop and lootboxes and we still don't have any in-game obtainable gliders or mount skins in the xpac which is centered around MOUNTS. 
---
What your suggesting is just a fucking band-aid and boring af, I'd rather fix the shitty system. 
---
Cheers
---
I'd say scummy, demanding things and not letting people time to do them. For free by the way. 
---
I just don't get why he couldn't just wait with posting it until he felt that he was ready to show is code. That would have basically nullified all these issues completely. A
---
nd the fact that he apparently did have his code ready and presentable just a couple of hours later just seems weird in my eyes. 
---
yeah im getting an error in game trying to add a new member to the guild and a guildy is getting one trying to buy gems.  i think theres something funky happening on anet's end.
---
What baffles me is why people rage in copper tier. If you don't like being paired with bads, then git gud and go back to gold.
---
Ah, that makes sense, I'll have to try later today then.
---
Cheers for the reply :)
---
Well, /u/Aviacks had the right idea, BUT what you suggest... is actually a **VERY** good idea. 
---
Which, by the way, some email providers like Google will happily accommodate. https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html - as one example. A lot of our players actually already do this with their side accounts, and so long as you don't make your email ThisThingHereRightNow@gmail, ThisThingHereRightNow+1@gmail or ThisThingHereRightNow+one@gmail, they can be actually pretty safe. Like your main character's name: ThisThingHereRightNow+Dornsinger@gmail, ThisThingHereRightNow+Charrpawzonator@gmail...
---
I realise the aim was to be sarcastic, but keeping accounts safe - gaming and much more important ones - is something I try to not joke about. :3
---
Oh, please, tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a ~~fuck~~ chrono?
---
Pretty much this. The worst would be to again put work into three new legendary great swords instead of putting it into other weapon types, especially one-handed ones of which you do have to have two anyway.
---
&gt; All we had to do was wait patiently for them to put up the code, but instead became demanding and accusatory.
---
I mean, the whole issue could have been avoided if he had simply waited to upload it until his source code was ready. 
---
Whichever works best for you, my keybinds are something very similar and I've never had any problems with gameplay.
---
If you want some ideas on different possible keybind settings:
---
-If you have multiple extra buttons on your mouse, keybind some skills into them
---
-Consider using combinations such as Alt+(number or letter), Ctrl+(number or letter), Shift+(number or letter)
---
-I've heard some people instead of aswd use sdef (1 character to the right) so they get more keybinds around, such as 1-6, qwrtagzxcv
---
What if I told you that Reddit supports things like:
---
&amp;nbsp;

# Headings #

* Bulleted
---
* Lists

**Bold Text**

Rules

I used to do that for several months, then got tired of asking heh. For me Home Instance nodes are worth it, especially the living story ones. I never needed to actively farm map currency since I’m “passively” getting them everyday. This works for me whose play time is dominated by instanced content. 
---
After this Living World season is over we'll have a better view. If they dive directly into another season then my alarm bells will be ringing because that would feel like Guild Wars 1's latter days. If they go expansion route that's better news.
---
I say this because the thread title is what I assumed this was about so I gotta say it anyway, invested too much. :P
---
&gt; WvW would need a complete redesign to actually feel like something other than a clown fiesta. 
---
And then you'll have a third of WvW players go "BRING IT BACK YOU BROKE IT", a third "YES THAT'S SO MUCH BETTER" and a third "I DON'T CARE I JUST COMPLAIN WHENEVER".
---
Costumes were made as cash shop only because they're inferior to armor skins, since you can't mix and match them.
---
After the initial three sets, due to complaints from the player base, people complained and Anet told us they wouldn't put full sets of armor in the gem store and would reserve that for skins. So armor sets in game, costumes in the gem store.
---
As I recall virtuallly all costumes in Guild Wars 1 were also in the gem store.
---
Thick skin is something you do need for raiding. Though if you are really that afraid, you might wanna start with a training discord: [https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/) take a look at that site, You might wanna check out the build section too just to be extra prepared.
---
At the end of the day, raids are pretty easy though. Good luck. 
---
Sadly, the divorce thing is a case we see... at least once a month. Breakups, divorces and so on often lead to one side turning petty and trying to wreck what they can - including getting the other's game account simply so they can no longer play.
---
As for future development, well damnit, Jim, I am just a support monkey, not an Engineer - I've no idea what could even be done feasibly! 
---
The repo has since been updated with P7 code (but it wasn't a problem to find anyway, as the dev left a note there with a link to download it), and D3D9Proxy dependency wasn't needed to build it at all, it's just there as a reference I assume.
---
Right, I get that. But the vast majority of people will read "this code is good" and then download the binary
---
I didnt, I'm on mobile. I'll read your post in a sec if I havent already.
---
And who will receive critique of it being messy? Oh, the coder.   
---
Who might want to tidy it up so they receive no critique? Oh, the coder.
---
Thanks for the post! I have gotten up to t3 fractals with healing scourge before it was meta, but then became uninterested in the game as a whole. I did all the endgame content of gw1 religiously, but for whatever reasons the community centered around raising never appealed to me. This will encourage me to give it a shot. What's the worst a heal scourge with mercy runes can do?
---
He clearly stated that he would put the code up later after he cleaned up his code (context later revealing that it looks like they wanted to call it a night) long before this all blew up. However we ignored his statement and demanded it immediately...repeatedly. I would be unsettled as well.
---
I wonder if Anet would implement this option to switch to better DirectX into GW2 itself so there would not be any controversy about these type of softwares. In the best outcome, Anet could even collaborate with the creator of these "small" programs/codes to make game "better".  
---
\+ Even if this post created a new kind of controversy within community, I myself am now more interested in these kind of (if proofread to be "harmless") softwares/codes, that can be beneficial for QoL in the game (who would not be glad, if their FPS were even slidely higher). I see this post more like an advertisement now...
---
Right. I was looking at it earlier and noted that the P7 code was missing.
---
&gt; What's the worst a heal scourge with mercy runes can do?
---
Die first
---
&gt;If they dive directly into another season then my alarm bells will be ringing because that would feel like Guild Wars 1's latter days.
---
Might as well start ringing them right now then, since we know for a fact that LS4 will lead directly to LS5 without an expansion between. 
---
I was completely dumbfounded by the dev's reaction, it immediately made me super suspicious.
---
Thats good, now if only I could easily run multiple instances at once again :P
---
You still can use LaunchBuddy just logging in takes twice as long :-)
---
Well, he's offering it for free, so regardless of his attitude your choice of take it or leave it remains the same, and has no impact on him whatsoever.
---
And his name is Faren
---
Arcdps doesn't work with it. Reshade almost certainly won't work.
---
Hell, if this wrapper works as stated, them reshade definitely won't work: reshade doesn't support dx12.
---
remembering and then manually entering passwords is what i want to avoid lol
---
So why didn't he wait with posting until he felt ready to share? 
---
The fact that he had supposedly already been shot down on the official forums for lack of source code should surely have prepared him for people wanting it here as well? 
---
That is fair and likely would have avoided much of this drama and in hindsight I am sure that is the decision they would have made. I doubt they expected even a fraction of the hot mess that popped up around this and really just wanted to share their first viable build.
---
&gt;im curious if a support based from snow crows will still be able to clear mobs etc
---
SnowCrows are raid builds =/= open world builds
---
This is what you're looking for https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World
---
Gaile Gray, my only hero in this mess.
---
Thanks. I've got all the LS3 episodes but some are absolute balls to farm. 
---
&gt; The second one is absence of the need of socializing with other players. System-wise there is no meaningful competition, no prestige, nothing that makes guilds meaningful establishments. Hence, no need of talking with other players or being in a guild at all.
---
So, competition and prestige would be the only reason for you to be in a guild and to socialize? You might be surprised that there are a lot of players that do have totally different reasons. 
---
For quite a number of people, just logging in and socializing is the main thing, their driving motivation. There isn't anything else needed than the human beings "on the other end". GW2 just provides an environment to meet in, and to potentially also do stuff in together if you want to and want to have more fun that way.
---
You can play GW2 in so many different ways, for so many different reasons, that it is easy to forget that you might have a totally different view of the game than someone right next to you, and you both can be "right" in your own way.
---
Assume he's been working hard on a hobby project for months in his free time. He finally gets it to work after hours of final debugging by the end of a long night. I can understand why he would want to publish it right then.
---
I use KeePass for now with its autotype feature. It's not perfect but I can't live without LB overlay window :-D
---
If they're using it to compromise accounts it absolutely has an impact whether people use it or not.
---
But he did share it before. On the official forums. Where it was supposedly removed due to lack of source code. Surely he should have understood that the source code would be requested here on reddit as well? 
---
The author had a English readme. No translation needed, the person who commented about his Russian readme was trying to discredit the author based on his nationality. And that is plain unacceptable. His other points are good, but he should have been like others and ran a network probe for 12 hours before he commented. But boy he jumped the gun right away and accused the author with a insult to his nationality. 
---
mmm ill give that a look after work
---
Keep in mind a huge number of differences with stereotypical unethical mobile apps. The difference in investment to create GW2 versus a mobile app is absurd. Mobile apps almost always have a much shorter lifespan, but can also be created much more quickly with less costs (and thus risk). The turnover rate of mobile apps is generally higher than that of mmorpgs (due to the large up-front investment). Due to this they're also less dependent (and often designed towards) groups and communities. Analysing where money flows without taking into account costs, initial investments and continuity of the revenue stream misses large parts of the picture, imo.
---
I also disagree that the game is "too old". It's combat system remains state of the art. It's art and graphic design remains pretty good. It's optimization isn't exactly the best, but frankly it's not that bad either. A lot of functions that game with the base game remain revolutionary to this day (i.e. no downtime for patches, horizontal progression, ...). It's probably still the best RvR on the market, which is pretty fucking depressing considering the state of WvW. 
---
That said I don't think anet can revitalize the game. As far as i'm concerned they're either unable or unwilling to make the changes required to accomplish this. Judging from their attempts in the last years my money is on unable, but at least they were trying. At this point I feel like they're not trying anymore. All I see is a slow and steady decline trying to generate as much income as possible while it lasts, with as little new investments as possible. Cynical, but why not? 
---
Even if this was no longer the case, without a re-brand in some way I dont' think anet has the marketting to convince players that would be interested. And considering how repeatedly content creators have been shafted I don't think they'd be able to do it either. So even if anet fixes their shit, many potential players who would enjoy the game would simply never know about it. 
---
I kinda wish the game allowed for more freedom through mods / developper communities / adaptations. MOBA's were "invented" as mods on SC and warcraft 3, because players enjoyed it. Plenty of gamemodes and games were the offspring of mods and player-invested development. Source comes to mind. I doubt that'll ever happen with the spaghetti code; but that's the only way I reasonably see GW2 actually grow again. If anet won't put resources in it, let players do it themselves. 
---
Armchair theorizing of course. Realistically i'll spectate the game's decline. 
---
And he would just continue to the next person who's willing to do it. As long as he's not asking for anything in return the most we can 'do to him' is give constructive feedback.
---
I made shit up?
---
One of the highest upvoted comments was about him being Russian in original post.
---
    [–]darthyoshiboy Asura Master Race 93 points 21 hours ago* 
---
    Yeah. I'm not running code with a Russian readme
---
Right.
---
These are from mod post:
---
&gt;And obvious that his first language was Russian which is a shady red-flag all by itself.
---
-
---
&gt;Then others have said that the russian language turned them down which IMO isn't such a big deal but a lot of malware is coming from russia so the reservation towards this is justified understandable.
---
That i instantly could remember and find.
---
Background: Thief Daredevil with a P/P is my second main which I play for T4 Fractals, first main is Deadeye. P/P is why I initially made my thief because I love dual pistols and thankfully, both specializations make P/P a solid choice as an alternate, so forgive me if I seem to talk it up.
---
* I personally prefer Hide in Shadow for healing. Yes, you can get quicker healing uptime with some other skills, but the instant stealth combined with the high value instant heal is something I find a lot more useful in open world PvE, especially if you're not looking to fight every single thing you come across.
---
* You're going to get a lot of different opinions on the elite/utility skills. Really, there isn't a wrong answer, it just depends on what you like to have and what you can succeed with. Signets are a good choice always but I also feel they're very unnecessary. It's basically like locking one of your tools off your bar for a marginal critical chance increase. Bandit's Defense is not something I would recommend for Daredevil because your build should give you plenty of opportunity to avoid damage (3 dodges + Staff Dodges + the additional dodges you'd get back). Fist Flurry is a solid choice for the CC on palm strike. Personally, I'd recommend Impairing Daggers for more quick CC and Shadow Refuge, which I consider an insanely necessary skill (provides you an easy way to get lifestealing health if you use P/P, long term stealth for avoiding fights, and a healing field for downed allies). But, using SB might change that around, I'm not sure how effective that weapon is with stealth fields. I also recommend keeping on your elite Daredevil skill - I don't care what anyone says, the CC it provides is massive, and basilisk venom can be very inconsistent in my experience.
---
* This goes without saying, but full berserkers is a MUST. Invigorating Precision in particular basically makes it a requirement because your outgoing damage is healing you.
---
*  For your specs, I recommend taking Unhindered Combatant for the insane mobility it provides which is EXTREMELY useful in dodging big boss AoEs. However, some people prefer the other dodges for the damage/utility -- it is up to you. I've personally found that the distance is much more useful. Everything else appears to be set, pretty much the choices I have.
---
* If you're having trouble with survival, I'd personally recommend using P/P and taking the Shadow Refuge idea. Legit, using your P/P inside that stealth field can regain all of your health if you're using full berserkers. It's a very easy way to get some clutch healing in on yourself.
---
If you have any questions on how to play the class, feel free to ask around some more! Everyone's going to have a different opinion on this but hopefully you can get a solid idea of what to do next. 
---
If you need some tips on the class, just shoot a message to me and I can help :)
---
Your burst plays around your trap "Test of Faith". So your goal is to set up situations that allow you to properly apply the trap damage. One simple way to do that is:
---
F1 the enemy, then pull them onto you standing on top of the trap (make sure the enemy doesn't have stability for that). The trap trigger damage will do about 1-3k dmg (depending on crit). As they land in front of your feet and are now inside the trap, your goal is to push them through. Do that with LB3 (traited) or swap to your second weapon set (usually sword+shield) and push them out with shield5. That should do between 3-6k damage, depending on crit. 
---
Should you land the Lb3 to push out, it usually gives you enough time to land a LB2 (Trueshot) right after, which should be another 2-7k depending on crit.
---
If you notice that the enemy has lots of access to stability, which obviously makes these combos tough to follow through, or you struggle to land the F1 setup, then try to place the trap directly under the enemy as you're fighting in melee range.
---
And yet it wasn't right then. It was after having tried posting it on the official forums, which also questioned the lack of source code. 
---
None of the ingredients matter except ghost peppers.
---
"Feedback is welcomed!" hmmm... 
---
Yes, code is dangerous. Right here during dll initialization, this can cause overwriting the stack, if there is not enough space in the buffer. Also code doesn't check return value of GetSystemDirectory, if there was enough space in the buffer. Documentation doesn't state if GetSystemDirectory modifies the buffer upon failure, infoBuf array is uninitialized and it can contain random garbage which was previously on the stack, even sensitive information and the variable can be used to get this information.
---
	wchar_t infoBuf[MAX_PATH];
---
	GetSystemDirectory(infoBuf, MAX_PATH);
---
	lstrcatW(infoBuf, L"\\d3d9.dll");
---
Stopped reading the code right there.
---
Lake Doric is probably the most straightforward map to farm. You can follow [this](https://i.imgur.com/ToQETTa.jpg) route to mine jade nodes on several characters, and if you feel like going the extra mile, killing a bunch of mobs to complete the hearts and buy bundles from the heart vendors.
---
Kinda odd that he refused first and now he uploaded it anyway. Gives me the impression that he needed time to take out the shady stuff tbh. I hope I'm wrong and that it turns out to be a good performance boost anyways, though.
---
The only ingredient that matters is ghost peppers, all the rest is stuff that's effectively free compared to the ghost peppers, you'll pick them up in your travels.
---
That's awesome, those look great. I'm not caught up with S4 yet, so I had no idea they are pushing that recently. That's great to know.
---
Either way, OP's concern is probably that none of that can be achieved through raids and fractals, which is what most would describe as endgame content. Taking WoW for example, there are so many rare mount drops, weapon transmogs... a lot of them that are *actually* quite hardcore to acquire, and that really prove dedication and/or playing for a while. Those are really important in MMORPGs. Not saying GW2 fails in that aspect, only mentioning that it's very different from MMORPGs that follow the WoW formula.
---
I'm a bit more perplexed with the fact(?) that this concept is possible but ANet arent the ones trying to get this done? Am I missing something here?
---
Agreed. I don't see how them being Russian has anything to do with "malicious code" at all. 
---
Nice, thanks!
---
Don't quote me on that, but I'm pretty sure Taco is a different story because BoyC used to make the unpacker for gw1, so saying he didn't have a reputation, isn't really justified.  
---
And deltaconnected got a lot of suspicious users complaining because of an unfortunate statement he made regarding his build template tool. There was no recorded occurance of his tool eating items, yet it was everyone's fear despite probably more than a hundred satisfied users. It was just him saying "if it happened" for whatever reason, he's not liable
---
They don't have to do 3 legendary greatswords...
---
They can do just one, they are not tied by what they did in vanilla haha
---
And there will definitely be a legendary greatsword, which is good.
---
From where do we know that?
---
Not being allowed to mount during combat is a GOOD thing, not a bad one. If you could simply get on your mount to bug out the AI and completely ignore every single open world enemy forever, it would be unhealthy for a game. 
---
\&gt;  Give him his P45, thank him for his time(although it was a waste of everyone else's) and tell him he will never work in the video game industry again. 
---
This kind of thing should disqualify you from being in any industry.
---
Well, based on the results that some people who downloaded and tested it reported, there seems to be quite a bit of crashes. Which might potentially have to do with the code basically turning of certain limiters and such and thus makes the game unstable. 
---
So while it might look cool and all, having it working natively would almost certainly require waaaaaaaay more work than this. 
---
So, uhm, no way this is running on dx 11 cards right?
---
Yeah. That and warn others that some lunatic is running around trying to inject stuff into people.
---
It's obviously the druids fault
---
Reddit hivemind gun b mad. You can't actually argue with reddit hivemind and call them out on it. 
---
The author of the mod actually said exactly this. That most people just going to use binary regardless of him releasing code. Which was downvoted and hated on too :)
---
It is true but i mean what can you do about it? There has to be a point enough is enough and ppl can trust or not i guess.
---
Me me big brain

The biggest problem with chrono tank imo is that it’s just not fun from a traditional tanking standpoint. I like to main tank classes in MMOs. I love feeling like the battlefield commander who’s calling shots and pulls and leading the team to victory. That aspect simply doesn’t exist in GW2 and it’s really strange. Tankin in GW2 feels more like grunt work where you’re thanklessly subjected to boring support based gameplay meanwhile everyone else is talking on discord about how high their DPS numbers are. You don’t need to work to maintain aggro in fights that use toughness, because it’s just an equipment choice. Normally tanks need to actually put out effort to keep aggro when DPS classes are really pushing themselves, and you get a sense of accomplishment when you manage to maintain it with some really good players in your group. 
---
Tanking in this game is just missing the fun factor, and because of that there’s always going to be a small distaste people have for playing it. 
---
&gt; So why didn't he wait with posting until he felt ready to share? 
---
Naive or excited would be my guess. Sharing a thing you made and sharing how you made it are two very different things. I have zero problems with sharing my polished code to everyone but the sinful abomination that had to be cleaned up before I got there I would be quite apprehensive about. 
---
I think I addressed the second question in our other conversation in here though
---
QERFC for weapon skills
---
VZUIO for defensive stuff (bind to mouse)
---
STRG + Q/E/R/F/C for F1-F6
---
**Chapter 1 should be PMA, #PositiveMentalAttitude.**  
---
Public raids live or die by group morale.   
---
One toxic shithead will kill the entire squad. If you're the commander, you need to snip this in the bud. If you're not the commander, you have to PM your commander and see if he/she is willing to do anything about it.   
---
The best thing you can do is to be the glue that holds the squad together. Wiping isn't so bad if the group is in high spirits and having fun with banter. Doesn't matter if you're fuming inside with your garbage squad, if you have nothing positive or constructive to say, shut up or drop the squad. Crack jokes, compliment people on their fashion, etc. Say things like "great cc on that last pull, guys", "nice recovery", "nice boon up time, Chrono". Anything to encourage your team to keep going. If your squad isn't doing so hot, don't say shit like, "why'd you drop poison on group", say things like "make sure you guys keep an eye on your special action for poison".  
---
If you need to vent, vent to your friends in whispers, vent to your guild, never vent to your squad. Doesn't help at all.  
---
**tl;dr: stay positive. if you can't stay positive, at least fake being positive**
---
But you can only buy one right?
---
&gt; Stopped reading the code right there.
---
Since you can tell it's "dangerous", it would've been nice if you told whether that part's fixable.
---
I want to say that while being careful is awesome, there were a handful of frankly invasive assholes all but crawling up on my lap in an effort to change my password.
---
People here are adults and can evaluate this thread on their own, based on available info. It's none of anyones business whether people change their passwords or not and getting overly invested to the point of inbox spam is just fucking creepy. 
---
We've had 3 PSA's now, you don't have to kick in each others doors and act all high and mighty towards each other. Thank you.
---
Uh, sometimes you gotta dodge, fam. Just make sure you are dodging /on stack/
---
Please don't just stand and facetank the qadim/largos shockwave. Dodge it. I know you can jump it, but the hitbox is a bit wonky on high ping.
---
Also take responsibility for your own actions and don't just blame a lack of boons thanks~
---
Point being, don't demand people trust you if there's reasons to doubt.
---
For a recent one, has anyone found https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zephyrite_Harmonizer_Saffron 's brother yet?
---
I’d say ‘I still like it... but might like it better. Might not, though’. :)
---
Never forget that any elite specialization can still use 2 core specs and all core weapon and skills. You dont actually need to run sword/shield with 5 wells on bar.
---
So pick whatever works for you really.
---
This is the kind of nitpicking the people are afraid of when deciding whether or not to publish the source. Seriously, how many people on earth have System32 folder not in C:\Windows\, but in a path that's close to 250 chars long? Or what is the realistic scenario where GetSystemDirectory would fail?
---
The map instance Ip address 34.200.115.152.0 has Forge Master Hilna near the repair anvil. If you get this map with her in this location she is bugged and won't give you the dialogue you need. Get a new instance and it will work just fine.
---
You're not speaking english mate.
---
As good as it is everywhere else...overpowered.
---
I keep mine...however...
---
I dont actually need to sell them for gold as i already have plenty for whatever i need (and i dont need that much as a old vet)
---
But i dont actually need any in some sort of crafting.  
---
So i just keep them just in case one day i need some extra gold OR i need a bunch of them to craft something, whichever comes first
---
Its your right to assume this but it isnt a certitude so don't say that there will definitely one cause you and we dont know 
---
Ah, right. 10 year old. Let me tell you a bit about the real world. People get jobs, now if they turn out to be too incompetent at their work, for example the one I mentioned, they get fired. My boss fired 2, almost let another one go after the month probation ended. incompetent workers. When you grow up you will see that that doesn't make her disqualify her from being in any industry, just  meant she needed to get rid of people who weren't doing their job properly.
---
D3D11 does not offer the same performance advantage as D3D12 - not by a longshot. Going from 9 to 11 will offer you pretty much 0 increased FPS.
---
Leave it open for +- 10 minutes, if nothing happens then ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
But *why* is it needed? Because teaming with others *must be* something to endured? How about, oh I dunno, people rethink the basic premise that a pre-requisite of a Raid is acting like an asshat? That’s an attitude issue, for nothing whatsoever to do with how ‘easy’ or ‘hard’ the content is. 
---
FWIW, the OP sounds like someone who wouldn’t do that - hope I find your PUG one day. 
---
When you have no idea what you're talking about but still feel like you know it better...
---
People were being assholes to him and then they were jumping up my ass to force a change of my password. It was fucking creepy TBH.
---
It probably is overpriced but I've already got it and it would only be cheaper if I bought the parts and built it myself, which I am not comfortable doing. :D 
---
If you have a system folder that’s very deep; 99.9% dont.
---
It could potentially run a buffer overflow exception and crash.
---
If this is the ”danger”, its unwarranted.
---
This guy is being a bit of a wad. It's dangerous in the sense that there's the risk of crashing or causing unintended behavior if the path to the system directory is much larger than the buffer he allocated. Not in the sense that the developer is trying to steal any info from you. And honestly, there isn't much risk of things going wrong on a regular system, since the default path is usually quite short. It's something you would want to check in production code, but this is alpha code and you can see why he was somewhat unwilling to share it at this point. 
---
&gt; That seems insanely overpriced.
---
That's because it is. :)
---
Make sure you Tides of Time and Signet of Humiliation that weird slubling with a name above it.
---
You want to argue that in a game that gives you a reward just for logging in? Where you have ascended? Where you have 80 levels just so that you have more to grind? Achievements? Masteries?
---
Clearly A.Net wants to build the game on external rewards. I am guessing because they see that this is something the users want.
---
It is accurate though, the game isn't very well optimized, it's just a fact.
---
I thought E was your herald in LWS4.
---
"Almost no rewards" sounds different to "no rewards".
---
So I am guessing they are still fine with allowing gamestyles that are not desirable?
---
The source is clean, and actually quite nice. The author just made the mistake of using a logging library with remote capabilities, underestimating how shitty a bunch of reddit armchair warriors can be. Seriously, the GW2 subreddit makes me ashamed to be a part of the GW2 community sometimes.  
---
Compile from source if you don't trust what he compiled himself.
---
I believe the actual danger is that the array is uninitialized, and whatever data that happens to reside in that memory are now visible by this code and can thus be extracted.
---
This might also be the reason why it is so crash-prone: not driver instability, but because it initializes in such a strange way that the video driver isn't programmed to handle.
---
It's an addon for arcdps buildtemplate tool that allows you to organize the buildtemplates you made with arcdps buildtemplate addon into sets, for example: one set of templates for raids, one for fractals, and one for open world.
---
So basically an addon for an addon for an addon.
---
So it won't help you if you have gpu older than nvidia gt2xx series or ATI HD7000. Right?
---
anets target audiance is a wide range of players. If you limit it to higher versions of directX you are excluding people. And offering both is a huge commitment.
---
Sadly it's a combination of laziness + I'm weird and somehow get emotional with old quest/collection items and don't want to delete them because they always remind me of something fun/challenging etc. :P I'm just weird like that. 
---
Then just add an initializer, compile and go! :)
---
True, but unless you're in some sort of competitive team it's never beneficial to focus on what *they* are doing wrong. There's always something that *you* could have improved upon.
---
FOO
---
It is indeed a horrible blackhole
---
Not as indeed a horrible blackhole as yo momma!

It's not like in Tournaments where you can make literally thousands of gold. In Custom Arena is reward limit 5g per day and it takes forever to reach is since you have 15s for win and 10s for lose. Custom Arena is great for quicker daily but gold farming wise, everything else has better profit than this.
---
Don't worry, there are a lot of ignorant people in the world. You'll have them support your "fact", and you can continue living as such - no loss.
---
When i play as chrono, i have no idea what im doing but it felt like im the best player in the world.
---
I just never have trouble having enough of everything else already in stock, with plenty left over. Or the costs of it are negligible.
---
At least for my crafting of SSBSS, ghost peppers are the bottleneck, and at that, they're the *only* bottleneck.
---
Also they planed to go three but daughter of one was stubborn so they gone 4.
---
is this thing needed for Aurora ?
---
She looks so cute ❤️
---
There is that some idea of checksums comparison, riiight?
---
&gt; Edit: since the original thread is no longer up so I can't confirm but isn't it Russian too? Fat fucking chance I'm installing unknown Russian software on my PC.
---
Aren't you canadian? And anonymous on the internet? Fat fucking chance I'm trusting some anonymous canadian's opinion online.
---
Why I have feeling Almorra died. 
---
For these sort of things a github or equivalent is probably a good idea anyways. Yea, its a passion project now, but you might want to pass the torch off eventually.
---
What the actual fuck, dude
---
I feel the same way. Mesmer just feels so useful even if you're doing absolutely nothing. 
---
oh my god can you shut the fuck up? it's open source already, nerd
---
As a Spellbreaker main, I can confidently say they don't have high sustain. 
---
You seem to think that gutting FC had something to do with Spellbreaker getting knocked out of meta. That's not the case. The advent of Boonbeast and Quickness Reaper is what dropped them from an A tier class to a strict C. Both can do Spellbreaker work (respectively, roaming and  boonstripping/cleave during team fighting) with far more efficiency. 
---
Your info is just outdated. Sorry.
---
And four Norn were an literal army.
---
Rarely do I see this subreddit display common sense. 
---
what? it works fine
---
Thanks!  Have been waiting for this forever!
---
The actual story and majority of info about destinys edge is in the books.
---
In game, the events in the book are in the past and irrelevant for you and your character and your characters personal story.
---
The first 3 chapters of each race involves one of the destinys edge members. 
---
As you play trough your own story of your own character, destinys edge is trying to get back in the background at the same time and you can find out more about it by playing dungeon story mode.
---
No spoilers here, but after the events of books about destinys edge, caithe is trying to regroup the guild (trough dungeon story mode) while you do your stuff with the orders, and the pact. Eventually they manage to pull them self back together and end up following you.
---
After zhaitan storyline, trough living world season 1,2,Hot,3,Pof,4, destinys edge members still exist, the world around your character still exists and changes and things happen, but you wont really do much with destinys edge members.
---
Everything you need to know about personal story (core,and expansions) and living world (all seasons) can  be learned by simply playing it, in chronological order.   
---
Btw, theres also a 3 hour long living world season 1 movie which does a much better recap than the brief TLDR one in game.
---
when all is said and done, now that the source is released to the public via github more developers can start pouring over the code and help out with bug fixing or start forking off the main branch.
---
i'll wait for more stable releases before i dive in but seeing the alpha feedback this early on is a positive for the future.
---
No it's just a Resource Eater like star of gratitude, mawdrey, etc.
---
It's a certitude... They said they'll do a generation 2 legendary for every weapon... That's the plan, I don't even understand how you can think there won't be a leg greatsword gen 2...
---
How about petitioning Anet for a 'Story Mode' with an easier starting level but reduced rewards? Lord knows people could be eased in to raiding instead of switching from regular PvE to 'Raid-Grade' straight away. Get used to mechanics and in HoT's case; train up their Raid masteries before playing hardmode.
---
I tried the Freezy Raid at Winter and just checked out of it because 1) I felt tricked into raiding and 2) getting thrown about like a ragdoll and rendered impotent almost 100% is not fun or challenging; it's frustrating. So I quit and am now skeptical of future new event missions.
---
God forbid this place.
---
Stupid cant say more..
---
He didn't though, he said that you either trust him or you wait for the source. That not asking trust, let alone **demanding** it! 
---
*We apologise for the fault in the subtitles. Those responsible have been sacked. Mynd you, møøse bites Kan be pretti nasti... We apologise again for the fault in the subtitles. Those responsible for sacking the people who have just been sacked have been sacked.*
---
Fair points, harsh reality, already hoping a framework for gw3 is in place (if it exists).
---
I actually am on Blacktide, I'd just prefer to be on Piken since most of my fav comms are there and I always have most fun with them.
---
I’m sure that when (or if) they do a GW3 they’ll keep GW2 running like they have for GW1
---
I was talking about pure ranked pvp, tournaments are also very good, and you usually don't even need to be good to get some money out of them. Trying to play in any tournament you can with whoever can net you a free 10gold pretty easily. 
---
The hilarious thing about all of this is that 99,9% of the people will just download the binaries, so ~~the~~ some source code is literally useless.
---
\&gt; As a Spellbreaker main 
---
That explains a lot. If you think they are weak then perhaps your idea of "strong" has been shifted due to playing that class to long, it is quite common for people playing these classes, so dont feel bad about it, its normal. I recommend you to play other classes more than just an occasional match, you will get a better feel of their strengths and weakness and how they compare to this "C tier" spellbreaker you think they are.
---
There is a notice on the top right.
---
Because custom arenas are match manipulation in everything but the name. There's no place for this.
---
That system is powerful enough to easily do 1080 or 1440p.  It shouldn't be too expensive to pick up a half-decent 1080p monitor.  
---
It will only help you if your GPU is capable of running DirectX 12
---
Really, I suspect the most time-efficient way to get gold is to have a job IRL, work some extra time, and buy gem-cards. 
---
It is easy nowadays with mounts, as you can skip whole troll's revenge...
---
You dont.
---
ITT: every gw2 player thinking they are a coder
---
It's okay; he knows "facts".
---
TIL chronos give you premature ejaculation.
---
&gt;Even if it was a hobby project, people will go at you for the smallest thing.
---
Granted it's anecdotal, but I don't believe this has ever happened on LaunchBuddy, at least not in the issues, or privately to myself. I suppose u/TheCheatsrichter may have received something privately, but not that he ever told me about.
---
I think this perception comes from your own (our own, as devs) critical thinking when it comes to your code. You wrote it, it's your baby, so if it's not perfect to the point of you having gone through it with a fine toothed comb 15 times, it's a horrible piece of hot garbage spaghetti code in your mind. I get the same feelings, but over the years have learned that "Good enough" is what you should aim for. Optimization can come later, and community feedback is a good thing.
---
And with what you manipulate exactly? The only purpose of Custom Arenas is to test builds or play with custom settings with friends, that was stated by Anet a long time ago when they removed Hot Joins. If I play daily in my personal arena where others can get into only with a password how on earth I manipulate with someone else's match?
---
Is a kick button also a match manipulation?
---
Nobody cares dude, take it to Github.
---
I mean, can you really blame people for being sceptical? 
---
At the time it was a thread posted with a link to download software from a user with a reddit account with little to no previous activity that was hosted on a github account with little to no previous activity, and was found to have a telemetry library.
---
When asked about the library, which was followed up by requests to see the source code, the developer got really defensive and repeatedly deferred. 
---
Sure, he probably just made a mistake but at the time his replies did not instil confidence in people.
---
You have no idea who I am, so if I told you to download my software that you have no access to in terms of source code and it was later found to have telemetry capabilities when it didn't need it, you would be sceptical too.
---
But "aNyThInG wOrKs In OpEnWoRlD" says the community at large.
---
Is this how it truly is as a necro? Because that makes me want to go back to my Firebrand
---
The large number of stats sponsored Russian attacks? You really think Putin's next big target for disrupting the globe is to steal a small number of MMO players accounts?
---
If you think about it fairly, it is weird why no people ask for arcdps or bdgm source when they release yet they ask for this source.
---
I'm a human main, and I'm biased. I remember in GW1 where the seed was planted! I have history with her.
---
Who says it needs to target the game? It could have easily had stuff hidden in it that target other things.
---
``MAX_PATH`` is the maximum path length that Windows authorizes under regular operation mode. Longer paths may be enabled, but they require explicit opt-in from the program and OS (and Windows is good about backwards compatibility).
---
While it'd be safer to check for the return code, the risk of ``GetSystemDirectory`` failing is astronomically low.
---
It was worse in the old days for Necro, they were deemed useless in dungeons and group support.
---
she's hanging out with zojja
---
My mum told me to defend yourself in all situations so I have permanent defense/insecure/distrustful/doubt mode activated all the time. It has saved my life more than once.
---
"It's not ready to be seen yet" is a term from artists, because artists don't want people see their unfinished work. They are very protective about unfinished work.
---
I have Hunt because I'm not always on a mount, especially when just walking between mobs and the like, and it feels awful to not have the speed boost. I could replace it with Wild I suppose but it's pretty noticeable not having the speed.
---
Aahahha, i knew it. I was sure this was totally fine. Can't imagine someone going to all the trouble to bring dx12(sorta) to GW2 and than use it for malicious intent.
---
Also i assume noone that actually accused him tested it, at all, not to mention with wiretap or similar.
---
There's probably a substantial part of their audience who isn't on Windows 10 though. This is DX12, not 11.
---
Not gonna talk about the rest because I'm tired of having to argue about 'easy-mode' raids, but Freezie is a glorified raid. It's more like a 10-man dungeon than anything else -- it is drop-dead easy even with 6 people. 
---
Regarding getting thrown around, well that's the point, the mechanics are there to learn and adapt against. If Freezie didn't throw anyone around it'd just be a loot pinata. Plus, learning the mechanics makes you get thrown around less -- and it really wasn't difficult to learn.
---
Those were the days... necro joined -&gt; instakick... :D
---
He hasn't done expansion content yet to unlock the mounts.
---
However that said I don't think Signet of the Hunt is that necessary when rangers have a lot of access to swiftness.
---
&gt;There's probably a substantial part of their audience who isn't on Windows 10 though. This is DX12, not 11.
---
Good point, but what about the game upgrading to DX11? WoW did it and saw nice increases. 
---
Eve Online did it, saw nice increases.
---
PlanetSide is upgrading from DX9 to DX11 too
---
Once per day per account, so no 10g a day from using boosted characters unfortunately
---
It's a story thing. You only get to use it once
---
None of the arena specific achievements, no.
---
Rangers have a lot of access of swiftness. You have lesser call of the wild under marksmanship for swiftness every time you swap pets in combat, and you can trait your shouts to give swiftness. 
---
What, healthy skepticism is bad now?
---
Look, I also checked the code, I also think it's fine, but the initial release had many red flags that made me entirely agree with people being cautious. The hostility isn't necessary, but that's reddit for you, and to be honest the dev's initial reaction was rather heated which rarely goes down well on any public forum.
---
Security is far too often shoved to the wayside in favor of shinies. I think it's good that the community didn't immediately jump on it.
---
:D it's a kind of casual clothes drawing of my mesmer because I'm trying to develop a style still. Thanks! 
---
Within the past year, there was some reason to go fight the [Champion Toxic Spider Queen](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Champion_Toxic_Spider_Queen) in Kessex Hills.  Someone I know who is a new player texted me to log in and help a party of new players fight it.  I'm sure they only ran into it as part of their exploration of Kessex Hills, but I remember having to wait for it to spawn so I could kill it just a little while ago, and its driving me nuts that I don't remember why I had to kill it.
---
That war was the very last occurrence of the 'living world'. Every single map of the game was involved in some way, was changed somehow. That's something they'll never do again... partially because people kept complaining that they missed it.
---
And it's a damn shame.
---
My Charr was part of the first organized response strike team into Lion's Arch, and her warband remained in the fight for a couple of weeks. The Miasma has left her with permanent lung damage. She has a lot of sympathy for the Charr who coughs, and curses Scarlet, in the New Arch.
---
That's the kind of impact that none of the new stories has. Because they exist in isolated binstances, frozen in time, completely disconnected from the rest of the world. 
---
That wasn't what people were concerned about and furthermore, if you want to help optimize the code, you can always do so, is open source you know?
---
... Listen to yourself. You've decided that all code from Russia is bad, because they are trying to infect your computer with hidden stuff to target other things. Forgetting the fact that 99% of Russia isn't involved at all in anything that is even remotely related to the news stories of Russian hacking.
---
You *specifically* said it was because their native language is Russian. Any application you download could have this problem, but somehow the language they speak is your focus point.
---
Whether or not you mean them to be, your words are horribly racist at the moment. You really need to take a step back and realize that people are not defined by their country of origin or native language, any more than they are defined by the color of their skin.
---
Yeah I kind of hope Anet go back to this. I liked how Norn didn't have armies and they would only fight if the enemy was worth it.
---
Most D3D11 cards also support D3D12. Check your card online to see if it'll work. You do need Windows 10 to make it work though.
---
I do play other classes quite a bit, specifically boonbeast, thief, and guardian, I am fully aware of how they play. I main Spellbreaker because I enjoy it.
---
It's not just me saying it, either. Look up recent reviews of PvP SpB on metabattle. The common concesus is that they are mostly obsolete, although still a solid pick. 
---
Please kindly save your condescension for your manservant. You obviously have no idea regarding current class balance.
---
Meanwhile, actual coders facepalming
---
What about people who use other OS than Win10, like Win7 or Linux?
---
Where did I *specifically* say it was due to the Russian language?
---
I said Russian.
---
you can find out what happened to the Pale Tree by doing this set of achievements and collections if you still have your Broken Caladbolg sword around : [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Knight\_of\_the\_Thorn](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Knight_of_the_Thorn)  
---
it's a nice little side quest of sorts and you get a free ascended weapon at the end of it, a weapon you can change the form of by speaking to the NPC involved in it.  
---
but if you don't have the patience to do that know that the Pale tree is doing well and recovering.
---
So we’ve come full circle to you being racist?
---
So essentially this changes Arc's UI from 3  options to a single one?
---
i bought HoT+PoF not long ago for just 24,99 € summed up, guess poF gets on sale some times and HoT anyways regular price 10€ afaik.
---
i also did not buy the living story stuff yet, but this game has also with "only" the dlcs, wvw, and a huge arse base map so much to offer that u won't get bored without this living story stuff lolz
---
How much does it cost for a spot on the 1st place team?  Might have to negotiate a monthly payment plan.  Government is shut down, but I'll be getting back pay soon^^TM.
---
😁
---
I can see you took that the wrong way...and then threw some insults my way, huh? Anyways, regardless of your opinion or that of others in those websites, as least in my rating (p1-p2) they are very common, so I go what happens in the game, not what forum people say (whose opinion, like mine, can be very biased). I do recommend you to work on your attitude though. Cheers.
---
Just sign up
---
It adds a new window for organizing templates into folders, for example you might have folder for openworld, raid, fractals, wvw. Then you could load the raid set and then you only have the raid build templates in arcdps buildtemplates window. So it's basically made for organisation if you have too many buildtemplates
---
pvp will never be relevant in this game. give it up
---
Every class, game mode and adventure works great with action cam. 
---
Shouldve had names visible, this one summaries pvp
---
http://prntscr.com/mc5sfa
---
Sure thing!  Which one do you find the most fun though?  It's a spectrum of fun right?
---
Happy to see a bigger official tournament than the monthly finally created in the AT system. Better than leaving PvP on autopilot for the rest of GW2's life.
---
Thanks.  The Wiki only mentioned a drop as part of Hope IV, and I knew that wasn't it.
---
The only reason why this sort of behaviour isn't considered MM is because A.Net chooses to not define it as such. Otherwise, we are talking about gameplay that would be considered MM if it took place outside of CA. That's why the argument that you barely progress is actually relevant: you are not arguing that you are not engaging in gameplay that has elements of MM, you are arguing that the rewards are so minimal that it doesn't make sense to punish players for it.
---
Fuck this noise. You what to cheat and A.Net supports you.
---
I really like the idea! I'm glad they are bringing some attention to PvP, hopefully this is just the beginning of it! Considering the recent map additions as well as 2v2 arena, I'm hopeful that Anet is revisiting the mode.
---
With that being said, we are still plagued with the same issues the costed ESL its spotlight: balance. Right now the difference in power between "meta" picks and those below it is quite striking and nearly insurmountable without resorting to playing meta as well. I'm looking at Mirage, Soulbeast, Holo and Spellbreakers as the outliers.
---
I hope the revisit their balance patches cadence to be one of weeks rather than months, and they give themselves leniency to make more often changes, even if these changes are not perfect, at least those can be further corrected down the line by subsequent patches!
---
I was hoping you'd realise your edit was plain racist. 
---
Oh my god please
---
The theories are about *how* she comes back.
---
And I'm not arrogantly mocking. I'm just laughing at the situation (not really at folks) that all these "I made this theory myself!" posts are the exact same as a whole bunch of obviously visible posts.
---
At this point, unless they've not / barely been on reddit since All or Nothing's launch, it would be impossible to have not seen these five theories.
---
I find deadeye really fun in action cam, probably for the same reasons you like warrior. Rifle is just a nice weapon to use in action cam
---
It shows the blue branding and a missing eye, yes, but I don't see any peeling away skin.
---
When they added spinners and variable amount purchases to vendors, nobody bothered going back to the vendors to replace all those bulk purchases with single purchases.
---
You are not the first, and you will not be the last.
---
&gt;These kind of items get manually checked on Anets side and passed through if acceptable.
---
Have a source on that? Because this sounds like unfounded speculation.
---
In fact your entire comment is unfounded speculation... No one cares what you think it sounds like, the person asked for help and your answer was "You're not banned be happy."
---
Don't bother opening them if you can't reach ~800% MF, you're better off selling them, unless you don't care about the gold and just want some luck for account MF.
---
I know right!
---
Don't think I've seen anyone suggest Balthazar wanted Vlast dead.
---
Except the Commander.
---
"you have very little understanding of class balance" is not an insult. Asking you to save your condescension is also not an insult. One is a true statement, the other is a fairly neutral request, my dude.
---
Anyway, I too hang around P1-P2. What a coincidence. You should be well aware, assuming that you actually *do* play at that level, that you will see players from every tier in your matches, since the MMR can easily pull up to 300 rating difference when filling teams. So it doesn't actually matter what rating you are, because it does not actually indicate team compositions or even tiers of players you may face. 
---
I do find your attempts at flexing your rank very humorous though. You should probably try to do something about your attitude, your humble facade appears to be slipping.
---
Well, devs just don't care enough about the Pale Tree to tell us what exactly happened to her. They should've let us speak to her straight after HoT, at the very beginning of season 3, but they didn't and now it's just too late. So realistically, we won't get to speak to her until she becomes relevant again for some reason which might not happen for a looooong time. As a Sylvari main, I'd love to talk to her soon but we've not even seen Zojja since HoT yet so I don't think it's going to happen.
---
Reproducible builds solves this, but I imagine trying to request that at the project's current state isn't too reasonable.
---
im talking about the souldound ones

DE is fun too! My only gripe with DE is their F1 should work with action camera without having to "select" the target.  
---
Users can't flair posts; this comment isn't really necessary

Well, it's how you want it, I mean - every artist has his/her own signature in their drawings. You should keep yours if that makes it unique!
---
o.0 How in the world have I never run across that concept. And apparently for C# projects its actually semi easy to implement, so I know what I'm going to be playing with for LaunchBuddy next. Lol
---
As I said, what you are arguing is that the gameplay seen there results in negligible rewards: daily progression, minimal gold and PvP progression. I don't have a problem with that.
---
What I am saying is that CAs allow for gameplay that would be considered MM if it took place outside of CAs. I mean why else would folks play CA if they'd need to follow the rules that apply outside of CA and be given less of a reward for it? Folks play CA because the can play them in a way that would be considered cheating outside of CA. I mean, just look at the thread we are in: MB is not allowed in PvP, except in CAs.
---
As a long time raider, I must agree with you. I used to never miss a fractal day and do lots and lots of open world metas and events. Until, suddenly, I got extremely bored. But that wasn't the game's fault. There has been new fractals, and I always loved raids... There's also new areas with new events, it's just that it doesn't seem that interesting to me anymore. This is important because it shows that the problem is *me*, not the game. **I** don't feel like playing, but the game is still there, offering stuff to do. In this line of thought, many of my friends are still logging everyday, always busy doing stuff, while I mostly afk in the Aerodrome, joining a raid once in a while. 
---
I came to GW2 during the beta after years of playing korean MMOs, so you can imagine the mentality I had. GW2 blown me out. The difference was so palpable, that I was like "omg, how could I deal with those shitty games for so long". The GW2 model of MMO is for sure groundbreaking when compared to others. The effective level system, dynamic events, horizontal progression, instead of vertical one, goes against the very basis of what makes a classic MMO, and that's fine. It's awesome, actually. I remember how long it took me to finish my first ascended set and legendary weapon, gosh it did feel rewarding. I got so excited. That being said, I had many moments of boredom, where I quit the game for a couple months and came back after to play intensively for a long time. GW2 is an old game now, and it's fine for its player base to get a bit bored out of the game. It did last quite a long time (I, for once, have like 6k hours invested in this game, plus time on my alt accounts).  I think that is more than enough to show the game isn't the problem. 
---
Play the numbers game. Ask to join guilds you see often while playing your prefered game mode. You have 5 guild slots so join a few. Don't feel like you have to stay in a guild if it isn't a fit for you. 
---
It's unlikely you'll find the perfect guild for you without joining a few that aren't. Keep at it and you will find like minded people. 
---
Why do you need to go all out agressive on me when I haven't even said the slightest thing to you?
---
I simply provided my observation about the "just kindly ask for the source code" as well as some additonal context so that the person I replied to could make their own mind.
---
Also yes I am pleased they put the code in the repo, that way people can see what it's actually doing (and not doing) as well as confirm than the proposed binary reflects the actual code. It will also allow some people to give a hand in order to improve the code there. So everybody wins in the end!
---
You being a right-wing nutjob clears up a lot.
---
Maybe Russians should fix their own government before they can be trusted by default. I don't know if that is actually possible, but the concern is justified. I hope the author is held in the highest of regard after this, but hidden source code being Russian will continue to be a red flag.
---
In S3E1, Caithe states the Pale Tree is slowly recovering. At the end of Knight of the Thorn, the Pale Tree is fully awake but still weak. That's the last we've heard of it since we've been in Elona ever since.
---
When you're in another land, and there's no internet, you tend to not get the foreign news very easily.
---
The only real chance we had of learning what's been up with the Pale Tree (or really anyone at home or even politics) would be from folks in Thunderhead Peaks, but everyone was too focused on killing a crystal dragon to talk about things like [how the peace treaty between humans and charr has been signed](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Xeniph).

Ah, I missed that it was unsafe in that way. My bad.

But on another note, [it looks like it is being worked on for d912pxy actually](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/commit/758a0aa677c7aaf9e5a9f885df74a936c8eb71c4)
---
Yeah, the problem that I can see is that ANet doesn't have a big technical-minded programmer pool. They have tons of artists, designers and so on, but it looks like their engine team is tiny or even nonexistent.
---
Unfortunately, I don't think the leadership sees value in changing that.
---
I'm assuming then that you feel the same way about Americans and Chinese?
---
Of course one of the most toxic players in the game, who single handedly killed a server's community, is making excuses for it. Of fucking course.
---
&gt; he really needs to check his ego
---
Woah there. It's hard to put something out there that you've made, especially in programming where people have been known to be particularly biting to newcomers 
---
From the light reading I did, the latest VisualStudio versions have the ability to utilize it. You simply need to add the decisive flag to your .csproj file.
---
TBH, yeah
---
Actually no if you want to make that comparison. A custom arena win gives the same thing as a a lost in unranked/ranked. Therefore even a win should only give you want you would have from wiping at the boss so that would be a bunch of magnetite or gaeting crystals. Since there is already a cap on those the cap from doing this should be lower as well but maybe daily instead of weekly.
---
I dont really understand with the whole github but from your comment it sounds like there was a drama to the creator? mind sharing with me what the drama was?
---
TL;DR at the bottom; Wall of text incoming.  
---
I agree with most of OP and also most of what you've said, but GW2 can still maintain a focus on horizontal progression while adjusting rewards to make people feel more rewarded. This should be looked at in a positive way if it makes more players play longer. In this sense, I think you've followed only one specific line of thinking suggested in the OP and hyper-focused on their assumed desire to implement some type of vertical progression or fundamentally change the way content is delivered. That wasn't my take on the OP at all though I can understand how many casual veterans would tend to hyper-focus that line of thinking.  
---
Because end game goals are so fragmented or individualized, you can do content like fractals or open world metas, for the most part, without having to directly communicate to succeed, it creates an environment that is more in-line with a single player or merely cooperative experience rather than an MMO experience, which is what players typically seek when they start to play an MMO. To many players I know, endgame is basically farming gold and materials to make legendary weapons, but in the broad scheme of content, this is not a sustainable community model of cooperative gameplay considering it's essentially a solo quest to acquire gold and materials, but less so accomplishment of individually fulfilling objectives. Grinding out map completion, acquiring a bunch of T6 trophies, gold, and a precursor is not really what I'd call a system based fundamentally and principally on interacting with other players in an MMO community. And I know that legendary crafting, by and large, is what keeps most veterans around and interested in playing the content. I would absolutely argue it is the only long-standing progression system in the community.  
---
I understand and agree with your position that GW2 is about horizontal progression and theme park gameplay, however, data does show that people don't tend to stay in the "endgame loop" as OP suggests. Now, quite obviously, the game has been moderately successful in retaining a player base, but if we're truly fans of GW2, we should be able to have a discussion about what could make our favorite game even better. And keeping players attention longer, encouraging them to integrate into a community, have more goals and rewards for playing cooperatively rather than just peripherally with others in zerg events to make money for solo quest rewards is something that is in the best interest of ArenaNet considering the longer the player is entertained, the longer they stay, the more depth the community has, and so on.  
---
To some extent, you're correct, if GW2 is the game for horizontal progression, the abundance of ascended gear for veteran players is not something I see as an issue. I'm still gearing alts and off-specs up even though I've been playing since closed beta. I don't think the answer to this problem of progression is higher gear tiers, but rather new systems that help the player feel like they have something to work towards. New stat combos, new elite specializations, and new masteries are features that I believe already take the place of a vertical gear grind, but ArenaNet could certainly look at other features as well if veteran players feel they have nothing to work towards. In the end, yes, I think if this is an issue for certain players, GW2 might not have every aspect of endgame they desire. But we also do have to consider that legendary crafting isn't really an endgame system that explicitly fosters continued cooperation.  
---
There is absolutely a conflict between players feeling rewarded and how ArenaNet monetizes the game. OP has outlined this and I agree, but I also think the balance is something that requires further consideration. ArenaNet runs GW2 like a business. They need to make a profit on micro-transactions to maintain development on an ongoing project of software development beyond the initial box sales of a pay-to-play game. To do this, there needs to be a separation of rewards available to players through normal gameplay and rewards available through strictly gem sales. Right now, GW2 does have examples of the player being rewarded with gems or otherwise rewards strictly reserved for the cash shop for just playing the game. For example, you can find black lion keys from rare drops, get them from story quests, and even map completion. Further, you can acquire gems for just building up account points. In this sense, ArenaNet does reward the player with currency and rewards that extend beyond the in-game rewards for playing the game. Hell, you can even sell the black lion chests on the trade post. In my opinion, the cash shop in GW2 is so well integrated that it actually feels like part of the design.   
---
To add to this, ArenaNet makes it clear that your playtime is valuable when they allow you to convert gold you earn to cash shop currency. With all of these factors involved, GW2 does reward the player and handle the cash shop integration better than most other MMOs that I have ever played. It makes me feel comfortable supporting them with cash purchases in lieu of a subscription. They also periodically give players free items and promotions in the gem store. Could they provide more cash-shop related rewards for actually playing the content to incentivize veterans to stick around and build community? Arguably, yes, but it's a matter of balance to maintain their profit vs. player engagement. I think they maintain the balance decently well considering the design a weapon contest weapons are available to make in game among other cool community promotions they do. I want to see more content like that and while I do recognize all GW2 does to reward the player, they could do more to reward things like mount skins for special achievements. But at that point, it begs the question, where is the balance when they could just put it in the cash shop for everyone to have access to buy so everyone is happy and they make their money back from development costs? This is a fundamental dilemma for the player to understand in how GW2 structures rewards and I don't think we're likely to see this get adjusted much in the future. It's the nature of the profit model.  
---
GW2 sPvP and WvW could absolutely use more rewards although I don't consider PvP the ghost town that people in this game make it out to be. A ghost town would see 6-10+ minute queues and very few people playing. I can pretty much get a PvP match in less than 2 minutes at all hours of the day most days. However, I do think many open world events require coordination, but those that do are so well locked down and on farm mode because most players know the mechanics and win conditions that players just tend to feel biased that they don't need to coordinate, but in fact, the community has coordinated so well that the information for events like AB or TD are such common knowledge that people don't really need to speak much, not that the content itself requires no communication, but that it has become that way over time, which is not at all a bad thing.  
---
**TL;DR**: PvP &amp; WvW rewards could use a buff. Adding cash shop items for player progression systems represents a fundamental design issue of profit vs. player engagement due to the nature of the payment model. But ArenaNet could absolutely do more to make players feel rewarded and incentivize other less-played game modes. Legendary crafting quests and resource accumulation are not endgame community building activities necessarily and it's worth looking at how ArenaNet can create or adjust content to keep endgame players in the loop.

Haha actually it's a good idea, I still have 11 gifts of exploration in the bank :)

I usually tip half of what I get, excluding basic gems and green gear (since the value is too low). Unfortunately, I haven’t sent out a tip in a couple of weeks...

Can to wait to try this out :)
---
The biggest turn-off about GW2 pvp for me is the players. GW2 PvP is by no means perfect but people are so self-entitled and Anet does so little about abusive chat, throwers, "I will just wait in spawn and insult my team" players etc.  it is simply a toxic shithole most of the time. You can ignore people until a certain degree but when you get matched with different ones again and again and know that there will be hardly any punishment, it simply seems not worth it 
---
Did you get this bug in WvW? IIRC this bug occurs when mounting up and there are no mounts in WvW
---
I suppose that's a little less horrible on your part then.
---
I'd point out though, that Russians don't really have much option in their government at the moment. And America is currently being held hostage by both their president and their congressional majority speaker.
---
I'd point out that holding an entire people responsible for the actions of the few is how certain horrible atrocities in human history have come to pass. As a species we need to learn to be more accepting of others.
---
Am i wrong or is it actually better to get 3rd place over 2nd in this tournament, prize wise? i would value gift of fortune and gift of mastery way more then a precursor with current market prizes, most cost like 400g max, while gift of fortune would be 700g alone.

In terms of open world pve, the survivability list, from easiest to hardest, goes necro, ranger, ele. 
---
Ele is pretty difficult to play, since you have to rely on your active defenses.
---
Never played a ranger, but the range you can engage at and a pet adds to your open world survivability.
---
Necro has a strong minionmancer build for open world, and you'll pretty much never die.

PvP gets enough love exclusive to the same group of 10-15 players as is. WvW on the other hand......
---
spamming your not so big inventory with a ton of unnecessary things isnt something a beginner should do tbh
---
First off, I love the legendary weapons that I have (particularly my Shining Blade). They're all well-designed, and I'm quite happy to keep them as-is. However, I hate most of the legendary foot trails. The Shining Blade's foot trails in particular are so bright and obnoxious, and I desperately wish that I could disable them. It's also unfortunate to know that I won't be able to override them with the tamer foot trails from Ipos, since Ipos is an off-hand.
---
So I thought, why not add those tick boxes to legendary weapon skins on your equipment menu that allow you to disable the foot trails (I've added an example in the form of this post's screenshot)? That way, if you hate the foot trails, but love the skin, you could have the best of both worlds. Or, say, if you have an off-hand legendary with foot trails that you prefer over your main-hand's, you could disable the main-hand's and keep the off-hand's.
---
I know it's just wishful thinking on my part (and definitely won't happen), but it's something I'd really like to see. You could even extend this system over to legendary trinkets, as I know there are people out there who can't stand Aurora's aura (and I'm sure it will be the same for Coalescence).
---

I put 6-9, F, H, I, M, dodge, special action, and all 6 quick keys for mounts on my Logitech g600. I get mocked by my non-gaming friends and family members for how many buttons are on my mouse, but I literally cannot play properly without it anymore
---
Ahhh I've done similar, and accidentally bought philosophers stones en masse. I forgot they sell in bundles of ten, so I put in 500, wanting to get 500 spirit shards. Cue 5,000 spirit shards in my inventory. 
---
It took a while but I used them to promote mats and sell for gold. Thats what I was doing anyway, I just. Had a lot of them in my main's inventory for a while. I'd end up using the runestones too, tbh. Just a future investment for whatever the next legendary on the list is. 
---
elite specs came out as HoT feature but PoF got its own specs just like it got its own guild hall, locking guild halls behind HoT only makes no sense, literally no sense

That's actually why I changed mine recently. I have multiple email accounts that I only use for one specific thing, that way I know if I get an email from (for example) someone claiming to be an online retailer or my bank in an account I specifically only use for a game, I know instantly it's a scam. I had my game email tied to my personal email from many years ago, but I rarely use that email any more.
---
Not the full armor set tho
---
He meant that there are no chest and legs parts. It's not full set.
---
Good to see this. As a lesbian, I like the subtle and not overblown representation that exists in this game - LGBT character just *exist*, without much fanfare (with the exception of Kasjory, which are obviously a frequent part of the main story.) It never strikes me as too much pandering - more of just a fact of life in Tyria, as I hope it might be IRL.
---
Some examples that come to mind:
---
* The adorable Olmakhan lesbians visiting Festival of the Four Winds before having (adopting?) cubs and crossing some adventures off their bucket list.
---
* The transgender Mesmer in Lion's Arch that "came out" after the rebuilding of the city.
---
* Caithe and Faolain's (admittedly troubled) history and relationship.
---
* A pair of gay Sylvari in one of that race's personal story.
---
On top of that, there's not a huge amount of sexual dimorphism or differences in armor for each gender (and, where differences exist, they seem fair? Both sides have a decent amount of sexualized or non-sexualized options...) and plenty of room for diverse and even fairly androgynous characters in character creation itself.
---
If you don't like going to Lion's Arch.  I've found the Mystic Forge Conduit to be worth making personally.  https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Forge_Conduit_(container)
---
But really the gold might overall more helpful to you.
---
If it's not there are the release of the raid, it'll never be there. I doubt they ever planned to make them and Anet doesn't believe in improving older content anymore.
---
That's an egg referring to Aladdin and the forbidden jewel in the cave of wonders. There are tons of eggs like that in GW1 and GW2. You'll anything from dragon ball eggs to Zelda eggs. The devs like putting stuff like that in game for fun. 
---
That poi (not in game so i'm just assuming it's this one, since it is the one EVERYONE needs in Kessex) is accessed from the island to the southwest of it (there is a hp on top of the island, and a heart with grubs inside) in the water there is a hole. You have to swim down, then up the U-bend to get into he hidden hylek village there.
---
You can delete 90% of the collections items. The main ones not to delete are the salvage of the intermediate items leading to the precursor and a few corner cases that take up less than half a bank tab.
---
People are toxic and cry. Instead of being happy to see more stuff happening in thr community they shit on their own community. Like this is a good thing for the game EVEN if you don’t play pvp. More community involvement is good!
---
Well OP is asking for an explanation so provided one. No need to downvote. What came out of hot was the guild system. Not just the guild hall. Pof made no change to guildhall. It just added 1 more hall
---
but does a newcomer know that?
---
So, what kind of gameplay takes place in CA where being semi-AFK does not ruin the experience for others and why should that continue being rewarded with daily, gold and track progression?
---
If you have a stack of 100 coins, you already passed one of the major patience steps. A lot of the legendaries really just require these sorts of choke point items or time gates.
---
My hypocrite meter just exploded. Bolds words for you I'll give you that.

Yikes. Trashing the company and the community, you must be a real joy. 
---
To be fair, for every scummy person trying to make bank off of my efforts, theres a person doing their best to help out in one way or another (giving alacrity, helping people who get stuck or mess up the proper way, sticking around for a good chat or porting me back up when I screw up).
---
Sometimes if theres tips coming in I'll pass some of them onto these unsung heros.
---
Was a great person recently helping out a bunch but forgot to tip as I was exhausted and I still feel bad for not passing on some gold.
---
I think the bigger issue is that the collections are 5g and 10K Karma each.  That's nothing to anyone who plays the game regularly, but that's a ton of money for someone who should spend that money saving up for an ascended set of gear.
---
well...that's after playing casually on and off for years haha :D Doesn't look like I can do much with 100 tho, most legendaries need 300-400
---
Yup, I was just thinking about how most of Mesmer's abilities require a target to actually fire off :/
---
Dont feel bad, u da real mvp in the end for even thinking about sharing your gains with those who helped!
---
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Future vision is messed uo
---
I'm afraid ArenaNet won't really do anything in regards to these reports, even if you submit a ticket with proof.
---
they put out a [statement](https://www.glaad.org/blog/why-we-nominated-assassins-creed-odyssey-outstanding-video-game) regarding that controversy
---
This isn't enough, GW2 needs more active balance, shaking the meta every now and then is necessary.
---
In fact, this tournament will be seen as another AT, I was expecting some kind of 10v10 or any other fresh mode, noone is really interesting in conquest 5v5 anymore, even us hardcore pvpers are slightly tired of playing the same games over and over. 
---
So someone else gets one green and it ruins your game? 
---
Probably not. Dhuum seems to be a plot that they tied up quickly because they hate GW1 story and lore and wanted to quickly remove all major plot threads from it, just like Lazarus and Joko. Even Menzies seemed to have been killed off, and off-screen at that.
---
it's really intimidating because of all the things you can't buy and require a time sink to get and/or a random drop and/or a huge grind - that's what I can't do. I understand why they are so hard to get, not complaining or anything
---
More power to you, then! My suggestion is for a way to hide them, on an optional basis. If you like the foot trails, keep them. If you don't, hide them.
---
Upvote just for the typo :D 
---
I mean, if you are jealous, nothing stops you from participating and beating their asses, right?

Is it a crime if the best players get something from being good at the game?

I never liked mesmer in open world. Things die way too fast for your phantasms to even matter. You lack aoe with chrono, mirage has aoe but condi damage is meh in open world.

They are good for portals and utility though. Just not a class I particularly think is fun to just roam with.
---
Honestly, GLAAD can go shove it. Ubisoft "fixing" their decision by releasing a "oh actually you *don't* have to be straight" DLC is not enough. They should've had the forethought to *not* advertise that kind of freedom before they took it away, and now they expect players to buy back the gay. Screw that noise.
---
They are used for some other things besides legendaries.

I am advocating that CAs do not require special treatment: their existence allows players to mess around, it allows for special gameplay, but since these arenas do not follow the game's core rules, there is no reason for progression to apply to them. If you want to progress, follow the rules. And if you don't want to, and want to potentially engage in gameplay that would be considered cheating outside of CAs, why should you be rewarded with progression?
---
I'm gonna say no to that because collections for Legendaries are a lil' gem that's best enjoyed while working towards it. They're like a little story, so a better suggestion would be to save up mats and those specific golds for the one you want to tackle first.
---
As others also mentioned, it's gonna add more useless things in the inventory of someone who has not yet figured out the game or just doesn't have enough space, not to mention the sheer cost by itself.
---
Plus most gen2 legendaries are not even tied to a collection, so eh, not worth it at all either.
---
I hadn't run w1-3 (besides getting up to and constantly failing the first boss). I didn't feel that Bloodstone Fen was at all jarring. In all honesty, the relation between w1-3 and Bloodstone Fen is pretty minimal. It was more a prelude than at all relevant to the plot. W1 had pretty much no relevance at all to S3 and could easily be skipped unless you want the plot for w2. And all w3 did was leave us with the question of "did Lazarus really revive?"
---
And for what was relevant, which was basically "who are the White Mantle and these Unseen Ones", Bennet had a recap cinematic explaining it.
---
The only jarring experience would be the sudden appearance of Bennet or why the Pact soldiers were there, but again, Bennet had the recap. With dialogue that changed depending on whether you killed Matthias or not.
---
If anything, playing through Forsaken Thicket wings would just further the idea that Lazarus was real, but the hints that he was a fake were so inconsequential that it only really came up to anyone at the end of Ep4, which was such a poor way to suggesting Lazarus was fake that anyone who played GW1 and remembered Lazarus would know that he didn't need all five aspects to revive back then so why would he now (because retcon!).
---
its a singleplayer game with microtransactions, what do you expect
---
I agree. Love my Shining Blade, would rather have The Minstel’s footfalls though. 
---
So what is your idea for events for a competitive gamemode? Log in and play a ranked game to have a chance to win a legendary in a lottery at the end of the week?
---
It's not like Zan is unbeatable, but he has a lot of PvP experience. Without organizing tournaments and building some excitement around a game mode you won't make people care enough to get good at it and compete against Zan etc.
---
Oh yes! I was so mad that I was foaming from my mouth and lost consciousness from hyperventilating when I found out that they decided to do that. :)
---
Now, it's my turn: does it make you mad when people call you an "idiot" for assuming?
---
There is also plenty of people who install them to improve themselves. Are they toxic too?
---
You can apply the same logic to every part of the game. Daily gathering in Kryta? I don't follow rules and gather it quickly in the home instance. According to your logic, I'm a cheater.
---
Neat, thank you.
---
I like all those add-ons popping up recently.
---
RemindMe! 1 hour
---
Everyone who plays this game for any form of PvP or combat is on the same boat, son. Don't shit under us.
---
If you accidentally complete a collection you end up with the chests sitting around in the bank.
---
A bunch of the precursors are also not worth crafting. Such as The Legend. I think when I was checking yesterday selling the materials necessay to make it then using that to buy The Legend on the TP would leave you with 200g more than if you crafted it and that is not even counting the account bound stuff you would have had to spend.
---
you're fabulous btw
---
So what exactly is wrong about more options? I always see these kind of comments on posts suggesting the addition of **more possibilities** and people act like someone wants to force it onto them. I personally love being able to choose and I have many legendaries with footfalls that I like and also some that I really don't like. If you like yours then you could just keep them.
---
Imagine we weren't able to hide our shoulder items. And now someone suggest a tick box to hide shoulders and people come in here and say "nah man I love my shoulders get outta here". Makes no sense, does it?
---
There are a few references in later missions to your choices in the personal story and a few (very few) changes to some missions. So if you play through, for example HoT, on a character that hasn't done the personal story you won't get quite the same experience.
---
But it's nothing massive or anything. The main thing is probably missing out on the consistency of having one character grow through the storyline.
---
&gt; JK if you're not willing to give up all your privacy then you have something to hide. Unless it infricts my privacy, then you're an evil corperation selling my data.
---
Well, so glad we're addressing this like adults.
---
It is not the matter of being asked not to release it *after* they released the binary. The sequence of the events matters.
---
The problem here is how much of the community back then demand them to release the source when they first release the binary compare to now? There is a notable difference in reactions. Back then, dps meter was in demand and often showcased by the streamers. More were eager to use them than to question it. That to say it is not there isn't any people questioning it but not to this extend that mod have make a topic about it.
---
It's Ubisoft. I don't have any expectations.
---
I know somebody running one of the metabattle builds for Ranger and their survivability is pretty high, not reaper necro high, but its pretty good. 
---
Unlikely. The reason they do head, shoulders, gloves and boots, is that it is easy to make for multiple races. Chest and legs is where it starts taking up too much dev time, that they probably want allocated elsewhere. Like when you see head, shoulders, gloves and boots in gem store these days. Can't see them going back to the Dhuum storyline either. 
---
It's an interesting idea, but I doubt it would be implemented honestly, what with the current less-than-tolerant stance many governments are taking on anything that so much as resembles gambling in video games.
---
It's reddit. Most people here play less than 30 minutes a day, 90% of which is spent afking while showing off particle cancer. I think he's sincere.
---
I use my renegade for farming with action camera.  It makes it a bit more fun to tag enemies. Pew pew pew! 
---
I would say buy the collections for the items *you might want to craft*. For example, I have crafted Nevermore - why would I ever want to craft any other leggy staff?
---
also another useful tip, even if most of the collections are account bound, you can sell the crafting services to someone by trading with them, say you have gift of exploration or other gifts already made but you have no real intention of completion, someone can trade you the mats to complete, you complete a legendary and sell it back to that person.
---
i honestly dont know witf got on what soapbox in this whole stupid disagreement between these 2 "factions" in here. as someone that has coded in the past and understands more about security than the average person whining in here - let me be clear:  
---
if anyone wants to install something that isn't vetted on their own system, good luck. not my problem to worry about.  
---
for any dev, there are simple steps you can take to avoid what happened yesterday.  
---
for the mods here, good bless em. it's a thankless job and people in 2019 like to cry about their own entitlement too often before using one ounce of critical thinking or empathy about a situation.  
---
for anyone that still wants to whine and cry about it - grow up. 
---
Bad way of implenting it. If people want this feature, it should be as checkboxes in the "Select Stats" menu (which could be "Customize" for legendaries). Could include toggles for arm effects and such too.
---
Not publishing source code doesn't prevent that in the slightest. At all. The techniques being used are not state secrets. This shit is effectively trivial for anyone with incentive to build malicious software. And you don't need source code to effectively reverse engineer something or base an exploit off of it at all.
---
The short version is the creator clearly stated he would upload the source later and we could choose if we wanted to run the binary before having seen it. Rather than being skeptical or cautious we went full aggressive saying  that just about anything he said was suspicious and demanded the source. He eventually called it a night and came back this morning with his code which thus far appears to be quite good.
---
Since you are quoting me, I will say the following:
---
* I don't have a preferred gamemode nor a favoured class; I play everything, and am part of the **EXTREMELY** small populous that can be classified to have effectively completed ALL contents in the game: PvP, PvE, WvW, Raids, Fractals, Legendaries, everything! Questions? Ask away!
---
* Assuming as much as some of the people here do based on a single comment (because they clearly feel hurt - an indication of how true said comment is), with no indication of anything about myself, is nothing but hilarious and pure entertainment. I hope they continue.
---
Mnemonics and acronyms are useful for some people and useless for others.  Frankly, I find them useless for more complex classes that have alternating loop rotations.  It's okay for simpler rotations, but without prior experience to draw on such as your guitar classes it's more musician specific than something generally applicable to everyone. 
---
&gt; 99.9% dont.
---
Honestly, who does? Like, what situation warrants that? In what situation would **anyway** have a system folder near 250 characters deep?
---
And for /u/moriz0 . There's nothing inherently dangerous about not initializing the array. At least, nothing that I can think of.
---
i think this is a usual scenario of ''everyone is doing shit wrong'', both sides at fault, the Dev being shady and defensive (we don't really know the cause of that behaviour), and the other side being fast to jump into the name calling/aggressive behaviour after something sketchy was discovered.
---
what's left now is, instead of keep pointing fingers is moving forward, improve this tool now that is open to the community, and forget this shitshow
---
That would honestly be a bad move, considering Vulkan supports every card that supports DX11 but is also low-level like DX12. It'd just be silly to use DX11. Especially since AMD cards still haven't got multi-threaded drivers for DX11.
---
It's gotta be Vulkan.
---
I am boiling with jealousy, can you see it from all the way there? I'm like a beacon.
---
It's almost entirely related to your second point. A game as old as Guild Wars 2 needs to focus on making money. Investment in systems that do not return some kind of capital to keep the game running are generally overlooked until a sequel is made. If this were an issue that Arenanet had intended to fix, they would have had the best chance of doing so right after the game launched, when they had presumably an excess of budget to put towards quality of life updates like this. 
---
Support monkeys need bananas too!
---
Else is going to be hardest to level and necro will be the easiest. The ranger is in between. The only thing is that leveling a bit on the ele will be helpful because their are so many different spells and combos with different attunements. Personally I’d boost your ele and just practice with it doing open world events and HoT metas.
---
This is ironic considering your initial post, being dismissive of someone criticizing a veritable rage-fest shaped incel uprising over lack of source code from a dev doing us all a favor.
---
Mate. you're a hypocrite.
---
It's a "friendly community", as long as you behave and communicate as part of the hive mind. :)
---
I think you can do a collection within one or two days. It's always money where the problem starts.
---
People have all sorts of personalities and backgrounds, and they don't need to "fix" their behavior if they don't want to. I don't want to feed the stereotype, but software developer are notorious for not have the most socially acceptable behavior.
---
Judge his work, not him.
---
Join a training group and get some KP?
---
If you have no experience with the fight, don't you think you will be limiting the fun of the other 9 exp members of the raid group when they have to constantly revive your dead ass?
---
Is your fun more important than the fun of the commander actually leading the squad? 
---
The answer is no.
---
Since forever. At least in practice. It's not new at all nor was it uncommon in the last few years.
---
I did not erase the original post, automod did after enough reports.
---
I read through the post and did what I thought was right at the time. I stand by that decision because at the time it was done I do believe it was the right thing to do. The safety of our community is our #1 concern.
---
Well, GLAAD does an annual awards ceremony, but this is the first time they have included a category for video games. PoF is more recent, so that gets the title service, but it is probably *really* being given for all of GW2's contributions to positive LGBTQ media representation. *shrug*

12345 for weapon skills

QERTY for slot skills, with Q being heal skill and E, R, &amp; T being utility skills, and Y being elite skill

i doubt that, most crashes comes from shortcuts and bad writing which causes memory leaks etc. if anet would help a bit this could be a optional parameter which would pearly make problems

It probably has some different skins now, but I have several sets on it and havent played it in a long time so I wouldnt know. Logging in is 2 much effort Kappa.
---
There's a few more in recent patches.
---
* A priory scholar in the Pact Camp in Jahai Bluffs who's talking to another pact soldier about his postponed wedding. He refers to the fiance as a "he".
---
* Even more subtle, but in the most recent map, the dredge sniper, [Sergei](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Veteran_Sergei), mentions his branded ex-partner, "Oleg" as he shoots him dead (which is quite depressing). Most people will probably not pick up on "Oleg" being a Slavic male name. 
---
Any class/build that has directional skills or AOE benefits from this - for example elementalist warhorn, without action camera he just casts the waves towards the enemy you target rather than the one in front of you. Ranger LB - maybe you wanan react to the guy that got too close to you and use skill 3/4 (stealth/daze), but without action camera, it will just shoot whatever you target and sometimes it's not the guy in front of you :D
---
people change
---
In the Jahai Bluffs near the Pact themed heart, there is a male and female human discussing the male's marriage to his husband in Lion's Arch being postponed.
---
Some people should, yes
---
&gt;  that her story line is just kind of done.
---
Sylvari as a whole are kinda done. Don't know who forced them into the game out of nowhere, but I think that person isn't really around anymore after HoT and the rest of a writing staff sighed with  relief and moved on much better races and societies. 
---
&gt; "original version (which has no glyph but has the glyph's effect built-in) "
---
Yep, as soon as I figured that out I reskinned most of my tools to use that animation. 
---
he alrdy got lot of sh*t and disrespect on the official forums to begin with
---
Alright. I've spent a fair amount of time this morning reviewing the source code and can say with some confidence that there is nothing malicious going on here. I can't speak to it's stability or efficacy as I'm at work and haven't had the opportunity compile and test it myself. 
---
As always, use at your own risk. Based purely on my observations so far I would recommend waiting for a cleaner more stable release (i.e. /u/Handsome-Matt 's changes), and compiling it yourself if you have any concerns. 
---
/u/megai2 - You are welcome to create a new thread for this, given the controversy contained in the original I won't be restoring it. I recommend reflecting on how easily and quickly your attitude towards people's concerns can lead to a situation spiraling in a negative direction. 
---
&gt; why not add those tick boxes to legendary weapon skins on your equipment menu that allow you to disable the foot trails
---
Because then you'd get complaints from the people who want the auras disabled. And the missiles. And the sound. And the enter combat effect. It becomes a snowball of stupidity really quickly.
---
As a person who didn't join GW2 at launch, I remember there being a HUGE amount of news when Kas and Marj were revealed.  Or, at least,  people tried to make an uproar.  
---
Looking at my generation, and my kids, I think we mostly consider  LGBT is just normal, in that there's zero reason to care who does what with their naughty bits.    I'm glad the game includes representation of what is, despite what some people may like to think, normal life.   
---
Actually, what I do "every time" I read a special post on reddit is facepalm and shake my head in disappointment, as I am constantly reminded of just how many stupid people have access to the internet - the replies to my initial comment here are a good example of this. Close enough, right?
---
Thankfully though, it's a good thing that there are some bright light bulbs out there to make you forget about the rest for a little bit.
---
Why are DPS meters a requirement for raiding?
---
Why put my account at risk in order to access a game mode? 
---
I never said "If you use DPS meters, you're toxic" I correctly stated that there are those who use them as a extension of their toxicity.
---
That's entirely subject and not all artists draw in the Disney style anyways. Theres a wide variety of artists I can link who have amazing styles!

In the domain of Vabbi, one of the hearts involves you playing matchmaker for the party goers, and maybe half the time, the matches are same sex couples as well.

---
chrono needing skill, that's some 2018 joke right there
---
Definitely fractals. I can knock out cms and t4s every day in less than an hour and get about 20 gold plus any ascended gear as well as mats. Probably the best thing for gearing/gold earning. After that do a little of whatever 
---
This argument is already countered by what I just said. Masteries, elite specs or revenant = these are things that came with HoT. They got their own content with PoF. Only guild halls got neglacted.
---
True reason I suspect is very simple. There is no dev working on guilds therefore nobody took care of guilds code to be available to be unlocked with PoF.
---
Problem is obviously companies proffiting on gambling. If you make it ticket based, it may be possible to avoid questionable practices like they do with lootboxes.
---
Where is that apology one of you mods promised?
---
&gt; I recommend reflecting on how easily and quickly your attitude towards people's concerns can lead to a situation spiraling in a negative direction.
---
Seriously? So you're that kind of sore loser. Not that I had much faith on the mods in here but this one takes the cake already *clap clap*... Seriously shame on you, the least you could do was an apology.
---

---
wait, so if the human magic was neutered, how come we could do magic in gw1? (I can't remember much)
---
Since the point of the daily is to gather the population in certain locations, the fact that you gather in an instance rather in the open world could certainly be a decent argument to limit this. Which is the same idea as with PvP dailies: to increase the playing population.
---
At the same time though, CAs, as I said, function on a different set of rules than PvP, and this is something that can not be argued for the daily. Gathering is gathering, whereas CAs allow for a gameplay that could be considered cheating outside of CAs.
---
So, it certainly isn't similar, but I am not really bothered if players would be forced to do the daily in open world rather than in instances.
---
U can get ascended weapons. Both expansions have specialization collections. Check your hero tab. U can get the new weapon introduced to the class and best part is that u can share them with all the toons. Eg: I'm using the dagger I got from spellbreaker collection for my weaver. The HoT collection needs around 40 per piece but PoF ones need only 1
---
Original Poster here: If anyone cares, here is what I finally did.  First, the GW2Hook suggestion was excellent.  I used it and was able to "green screen" quite well.  To augment GW2Hook, I took a suggestion posted by user Lars-Preston and did the green screening on that sandy jackal trail above the pyramid in Crystal Oasis.  That enabled me to get the feet of my characters and everything.
---
While GW2Hook worked quite well, I eventually discovered that it didn't quite meet all of my needs.  To get another shot, I really needed a photographer.  So -- I created one.  I signed up for a second (free) account and created a character.  I placed her in Divinity's Reach and then partied up with her with my main character, the subject.  Having a second account to "take" the photo worked really well. (No, I don't have any friends.)
---
In fact, it worked so well that I decided to take a group photo of all my favorite characters.  To do this, I left the "photographer" character from the 2nd account in place and DID NOT MOVE HER OR CHANGE ANYTHING after I had framed the shot.
---
Then, one at a time, I moved my other characters into the frame and on to their marks.  Having sketched it out ahead of time, I knew where I wanted each one to be.  This process, while slow, eventually produced 10 different images of 10 different characters, all in different spots in the same frame.  I composited them in Photoshop and now have a group picture.  If I remember, I'll come back and post the final product.  I still need to tweak it a bit.
---
Anyhoo, thanks for the help!
---
http://prntscr.com/mc7x0q Shit quality but I'm proud
---
The alternative is to look for a static group if time allows it. People are less likely to act like assholes if the group isn't too serious. Treat you appropriately because you're not a one off rando. They will get to know you. Know that you're capable so more lenient on the mistakes. It's whatever, no one plays perfectly 100% all the time every single raid.

Get really wierd if u do it for weaver XD Ffffffff

My mesmer, [Vinnet Cianna](https://imgur.com/a/9ZDPsSy). I like the "heavy armour" look on her. I should have zoomed more while I was taking this shot :(

First toon took idk how long but for new toons I hoard up tomes of knowledge from dailies/fractals and when I have enough I just boost them. Usually within a month give or take I can get enough to fully boost a toon. I like that because it gives me time to play my new characters for a bit before just moving to another 9ne
---
Even as moderators, you don't have the right to judge someone's work based on their behaviour. Or to preach what is acceptable outside of the subreddit rules.
---
At the very least you guys owe the dev an apology for misjudgment by the mod team. And also for this comment.
---
&gt; more lazy everytime
---
You say this as if they had at some point resleased a full armor set as drop rewards from a raid boss. IMO the dhuum "set" was a great addition and it was way better than what had previously been released in terms of raid drops. It's more progress than regress.

I said it as I read it, for me it just made it seem as they were giving him permission.
---
Not saying that is untrue, but that wasn't really the point I was trying to make. They could've handled this in a much smoother way without basically giving the middle finger to the guy.
---
I'd never **not** support them adding customization features that would make people happy, just not sure it's a worthwhile use of development time from their perspective. It may seem like a small issue to fix, but they would basically have to map variables for the foot fall animations of each weapon specifically if they don't already exist. And then that begs the question of how they store these animations for each particular object. Perhaps the animation and the weapon aren't separate when they need to be to create the global variables for toggling that you're asking for. It may amount to 20+ hours of tedious and mechanical development time that could be used on bug fixes, coding balance changes for trait functions, so on and so forth. So while I support the idea if it makes people happy, I'm just saying that, if these are potentially back end changes, it's unlikely that they see direct value in addressing them over other things.
---
Rules are made by Anet and since they allowed it it's clearly ok. Just because you don't like doesn't mean it breaking rules.
---
There needs to be a tutorial for newer players, balancing the obnoxious classes (like cancer mirage), which can be very frustrating for newer players since they won't know wtf is going on with all the visual clutter and immediately die to confusion, also an option to vote for the best player in your team etc.

That last paragraph is completely ignorant. To completely avoid the fact that the thread's decline into anarchy was also in part due to the community's rabidness is very sad.

Get good and you won't have to cheat to get your rewards? 😉
---
As I said, follow the game's basic rules and I absolutely agree that you should be rewarded for it. But if you are going to break the rules, then why the hell should you be rewarded for it?
---
I still would like to know what kind of nightmare that special Sylvari in episode 5 is broadcasting to the Dream.
---
You can look cooler running around wvw with the latest fashion in the gemstore, adds a whole new layer of complexity to wvw!
---
"I recommend reflecting on how easily and quickly your attitude towards people's concerns can lead to a situation spiraling in a negative direction."
---
This is the part that pisses me off. Sure the mods are entitled to opinions, but a pinned mod post doesn't need preachiness. The comment is incredibly judgemental.
---
The mods overreacted, their suspicions were proven wrong, the dev has been insulted enough. What they deserve is not a sermon or confirmation of mod's authority. They deserve an apology.
---
I know it's none of my business. But I prefer that Moda supervise this sub and thank you for it. Worst case you have to apologize. Compare that to if the case was with malicious intent. Now I know people take issue with it not being an apology and more criticism but still. That's not up for me to say.
---
Long and short of it, issuing an apology is better than having countless people **hacked**. Always.
---
Those players are going to exist and find ways to be toxic whether or not they have the DPS meters.
---
Back before DPS meters it was "Rangers and Necros not allowed" to dungeons. Somehow, someway, people will find out what's best, and toxic elitist people will find a way to make sure that's all that is allowed in their parties.
---
Having a DPS meter does make it easier to tell when someone isn't pulling their weight, I will grant you that. But it's still on the person as to what they do with that information.
---
And, personally, I've only ever kicked one person for DPS, but it was egregious and I might not have known without the tool. It was a DPS Ranger that was pulling less DPS than our Druid. I asked him what his build was, if he forgot trinkets or something, and he just responded with "It's a custom build and idgaf if you don't like it I don't play meta."
---
So, I kicked him, because I can't have a DPS player doing a Healer's damage and be unwilling to change. Does that make me toxic? I personally don't think so. 
---
The tool can be used with good and bad intentions. But I don't think the tool itself creates toxicity. Sure, maybe makes it easier to pinpoint who the toxicity gets pointed at, but I'm not convinced it creates it by itself.
---
Well I didnt want to offhandedly admit that the raiding community is toxic but if youre gonna do it for me...
---
I am new to the game, I don't understand any of this.  
---
What trophies are you talking about?
---
Trophies aren't mentioned in the Pharus longbow crafting list.
---
"What do you mean i have to press buttons other than my autoattack?"  
---
You can use 1 of the 4 types of magic, but not all of them.
---
Thanks, Dad.
---
Seems like you have to craft a few more legendarys than intended.
---
Do you know that if you set custom arena rules way outside of normal arena parameters matches there doesn't count towards any rewards?
---
You see an issue what isn't there.
---
Welcome  :)
---
Trophies is just another word for [intermediate crafting materials](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crafting_material#Intermediate_crafting_materials). In your Pharus crafting list, you probably see 35 large bones or 35 potent venom sacs. 
---
Because saying Intermediate crafting materials is such a mouthful, we also use trophies. We got the name from [trophy shipment](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trophy_Shipment) which contains these crafting materials and is also a good way to get them!
---
If it is unclear or if you have more questions, don't hesitate to ask!
---
Give an an inch they take a mile. I. Awaiting excuses that use this policy filled with "but I can here!"
---
Yeah, that one is rough. The fights are at least made easier with a healer, but for some reason people still seem baffled about how the maze works.
---
You are taking these snowcrows rotations far too seriously.
---
I would give so much for Dhuum Chest, Dhuum Legs, and any other pieces of Xera's Marionette armor outside of the gemstore helmet. These kinds of skins are the real reward in Fashion Wars 2 for doing the raids, and I'd love for the sets to feel completed.

How are those treated as f2p account? You do not own HoT there for you will not have access to Hot stuff. Just as people who only own HoT will not have access to mounts. Buy both and you have it all.

I don't like reaching past 5 either. I have an MMO mouse, but I also don't like reaching the bottom 2 rows, so I've ended up with these keybinds:
---
Mouse buttons 1, 2, 3 (top row), 4, and 6: Weapon skills
---
Mouse button 5: Dodge
---
Q - heal skill
---
E, R, T - Slots skills
---
G - Elite skill
---
C - Weapon swap
---
1,2,3,4,5 - Profession skills
---
F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 - Raptor, Bunny, Skimmer, Jackal, Roller beetle
---
` - Griffon
---
Middle mouse - Special skill (or whatever it's called...the extra action 
---
you get in certain fractals or story instances)
---
No idea.

I'd love it if A.Net implemented its variation of Overwatch's Arcade: different game modes with rewards. But you need to follow some basic rules. And the reality is that players in CAs can now participate in matches that constitute match manipulation outside of CAs. That's not what I consider a slight variation: that's what I would consider cheating.
---
(And as I said, I would still allow people to play that way, I'd just remove rewards from those matches. Let people have their fun, but certainly don't reward them if they can't even follow some basic rules.)
---
Be sure to wait a little while for the sound to cycle through the little snore.
---
Keep trying to hide behind that safety of community bullshit while we both know if people didn't talk about telemetry or other uninformed people didn't suddenly start a panic train and mass-report, that post would be there and you'd not make a mod post adding more misinformation. You were one of those folks that randomly spread fear for no reason except you decided to abuse your power in that moment and caused it to get out of hand. 
---
Safety is good, spreading misinformation in mod posts is not. The fact that you still believe you did the right thing is sad. First it was a mod doing that shit to noxxie, now you doing this. I see glorious days ahead for this sub unless you guys learn to say yea.."we were wrong we acted shitty."

Wait, so they fixed red resign? Where you play a normal game, but one side intentionally loses so the other side gets their dailies and progression fast and easy? I mean, that would be considered MM outside of CAs ...

I did Google both names because I picked up on it and wanted to be sure. I do really enjoy gws take on most relationships. It's not preachy, just as it should be. It's natural and there's no reason for it not to be natural in gaming. But no-one wants "they are gay" thrown at them 24/7 either.
---
Personal opinion on this:
---
&gt;Certain bosses and abilities have these sound effects, that tell you when they are about to go off. Like Deimos mindcrush. If you get used to them, you can easily handle them without even looking.
---
It would be more convenient if these audio cues would have separate volume option out of the whole mish-mash of sound effects you usually hear (Wells, basic attacks, War's bursts, etc.)
---
Oh I hope there will be a stream so we can watch the finals at least. 
---
Yeah, and that's what I meant about the backend. And you're probably right in that they would end up having to go too far back, and it would therefore time/cost-inefficient. I remember ANet addressing weapon dyes some time ago and mentioning how they weren't even on the table (though I didn't look at the reasoning), but that alone speaks to how slim the hope is the front for my suggestion. Their backend sounds like a headache, to be honest.
---
Carys and Tegwen! Cutest Sylvari couple!

Hey!  How is this a satisfying hobby for you?  I’m curious!  Some of the JPs in this game, Chalice of Tears specifically, are extremely frustrating.  I’m always thankful for a Mesmer nearby helping out and I always wonder WHY they spend their game time doing this stuff.  
---
Thank you, and I always tip!
---
It'd have been cool if at least some  of the story instances had repeatable weekly (if not daily) rewards, like how it used to be with Zaishen Coins and that you could claim them for certain special rewards like the envoy weapons, but I'm guessing that they cater to the casual solo crowd when it comes to living story instances and avoid these kinds of systems.

You can only use the bottom specialization trait line for elite specs, i.e. chrono/mirage. But imo, if you *just* unlocked chrono, there's nothing really useful yet, only allowing you to use shield. You should only think about equipping the chrono spec when you have the *entire* spec unlocked. But, you do you.

Only Windows 10? I"m still running Windows 7 (cause I like it way better), does running gw2 on DirectX12 have any advantages for me?
---
Definitely a better suggestion, but probably more work than it needs to be. Not that my suggestion isn't already that.
---
Every week 3 worlds got put against eachother based on their win/loss rate that determined their rank/place. The higher the rank the better rewards.
---
The most fun about this was that it caused some rivalries between worlds (like the skilled Desolation vs double teaming SFR).
---
Enough reason to not try then; love my reshade. Thanks for the heads up
---
Comically missing the point, I hope...
---
Most important thing to do is not join the guilds that get posted in map chat, those places are cesspools of drama, if you just ask people that are nice to play with in dungeons if you can join their guild 8/10 times they'll say yes.
---
Sshhh, ofc I am, but dont spill the bean (:
---
I'm about to embark on crafting ascended armor and weapons as a first timer in any MMO, so I am brand new to the process. I have a few lvl 80s and a lvl 13 toon that holds all of my materials. Can I use the lvl 13 to craft, as it holds all of the mats and I eventually want to level it to 80? Or is it better to use a higher level toon for crafting? Not really sure how it works.
---
The unbound tools are overall better at bulk gathering than the volatile ones, only from the perspective that the skin on the gathering tools have different effects (which can be substantial). For example the Unbound Harvesting Blast (sickle) is a "single swing multihit" so it'll only use one swing to gather, even if you have something like an Item Booster or Glyph of Bounty on it to give it an extra hit on the node, it'll grab that too. The Unbound Mining Beam (pickaxe) ironically gives more Volatile Magic per hit than the Volatile Magic Gathering Tools' pickaxe (VM tool gives about 1-4, the UB tool has given 3-9).
---
If you just wanted a single set of tools (from a pack), I'd wait for the UB ones to swing around. Alternatively if you wanted to just get any 3 sets of unbreakable tools, you'd probably want to wait still, as the Consortium pickaxe is currently out of the rotation and its one of the fastest sickles (specifically its great for when you run multiple alts through places like Bitterfrost Frontier for berries or other plant harvesting runs).
---
I think the real problem that drives them away from making them into dungeons, is that they may have to go back and re-tune them in the future because players will find ways to cheese the encounters or anything else that comes with it, remembering how arah skipping was a thing (and still is), etc.  
---
On the other hand, even half-assed content is better than no content, tune the rewards to make them worth the time to visit them again, tune them a bit to be a little harder for more people, and call it a day, you have yourself a dungeon style 5-man content. (i know it sounds a lot easier than it is but still).
---
Oh absolutely, I'm not trying to say anything else -- I remember the horror days of '5k ap no necro no ranger' dungeon LFGs.
---
My point was that some players use it for self-improvement, others as an epeen -- and IMO you do have to admit the latter happening means you can't say dps meters aren't involved in encouraging toxicity, even if it's ultinately just a tool that does what people want from it.
---
No. I did this.  The inventory spam and unknowing of if you chills keep X item or not was a huge pain in the ass.
---
I do not recommend it after having done it.
---
Sent you a PM! Pop me your IGN! 
---
It's more about appearances and perceptions than anything else. I suspect they removed betting from the Cattlepult for much the same reason.
---
I'm not on the up-n-up here, but what did this do exactly? Does it force GW2 to use DX12 instead of 9? And other than performance, are there any benefits?

Guild Wars 2 is fine as it is, but what it really needs... is new dungeons; With armor and weapon sets along with them. Give people something more tangible and easy to find a group for, not that fractals are hard to find groups for.

---
Did you just assume my race?

I’m new how do collections work always here people talking about them? Just hit level 22
---
Any character can learn crafting, doesn't matter which one you pick as character level doesn't affect crafting speed or the ability to craft certain materials (for example being Lv80 isn't a requirement to *craft* ascended gear, just to *wear* it). You also don't need to put every single craft on the same character, as you can (and its much preferred) to spread them out among your alts (as materials and resources can be transferred through the bank, and every crafting station functions as a bank too).
---
Mmm...beans...
---
You should think about whether you want to grandstand when you're sending around abusive PM's over this.
---
I agree its another way for assholes to be an asshole others. I guess it comes down to how I think about dps meters. The benefit they bring is more important to me (and should receive more emphasis) than having another avenue for dipsticks to put players down.
---
I just see enough posts/comments shitting on dps meter's because someone is being mean and its like ffs they are a asshole ignore them move on and/or improve your play and show them up. Perfect example is running CM's yesterday and the dps chrono was shitting on the spb/banner warrior and reaper necro for being shit dps classes when the spb had more dmg done on every boss than them(99cm). Then when we did skorvald they were all proud to be top dps when the reaper fell off the edge at 66% and the warrior (and everyone else) was working to res the reaper.  If i was not running a dps meter is would have been alot harder to knock them down a peg and laugh them off when they were being all "im better than u" on us.
---
But this isn't about porn.
---
May the Purple Bliss be with you!
---
Number 1 complain we see today from most of gw 2 players are that LW last for a few days and then you can come back in 2 months for the next episode.   
---
I am all for taking a bit more time to make a dungeon so people have something to replay in the meantime.  
---
(There are Raids and Fractals yes, but lets be fair, most of the players don't bother with them cause they find them very hard). Easier content = more people play it.
---
Introducing tension between them due to Balthazar and Kasmeer's faith seemed like a smart move at the time. It was pretty obvious that their break from each other was temporary, but I was still invested in seeing how they would knit their relationship back together. As I expected, we got to see Kas work through her religious hiccups (heh) over the course of PoF... and then we weren't witness to how this new character development affected the relationship. The two of them have spent the better part of Season 4 stalking Kralkatorrik, so I assume they're back together, but it's weird that the devs planted all this tension between them since S3, and then resolved it offscreen.
---
Just regarding the part of being a programmer: I am a developer and I am expected to make clear and reasonable estimations/predictions. Lucky strokes during the last months? Nice, I take them.  
---
Small thing taking longer? For sure, happens. But not to an extent like this.

Spring Ice is an almost perfect match, honestly. Other good choices would include Pastel Olive, Olive Ice, or Iboga.
---
As someone working towards Astralaria RN, let me list the things that I can't buy and fufill your requirements. Gift of Battle (complete a sPvP or WvW track), Gift of the Cosmos (a collection, I don't know what it's like now, but the prior collections are fairly simple), Gift of Maguuma (map complete Maguuma), Gift of Insights (complete all the HoT masteries [this one kinda sucks, but if you have LWS3, you'll get the XP sooner or later]), 250 Crystalline Ingots (this one simply requires doing the HoT map metas). So of them, the only ones I'm struggling with is Gift of Battle, because I don't play PvP, and Crystalline Ingots, because I've only done Dragon Stand once.
---
It's gonna be a part of GW3 along with capes and a grace period on your map if you get a disconnect.
---
Man I'm so torn on this company. They repeatedly release really addicting, great quality games but fog it all up with controversy and bad decisions.
---
I only sometimes tip, but I always bow and say thank you.  
---
Don't forget about build templates and proper pvp game modes
---
That depends entirely on whether you have all of the Core Tyria HPs done, or if you have PoF.
---
No you do not have to finish HoT maps to unlock your spec completely. Reaching level 80 is enough to unlock all core specs. Every heropoint you do in core tyria can contribute to your elite spec but it is 10x slower since every heropoint in HoT/PoF gives 10 points.
---
If you want an easy way to unlock your elite spec join a HP train. Doing the HPs in a group makes them a lot easier.
---
No, you can go to PoF maps to gain hero points. I do hope you revisit HoT map later on when you feel ready for even more hero points 
---
I could be entirely off base, but doesn't Windows 7 cap out at dx11?

They for sure didn’t. Looking at build templates
---
Manners and etiquette are highly appreciated as well! (Well...chrono...ok I'll see myself out :D).
---
It is complete opposite of terrible decision.
---
I think plenty of these PvPers would take mapcomp (gift of mastery) every time. Gold and clovers can be gained by PvP. Clovers and gold are rewards for PvP / ATs. Mapcomp forces them to do something many don't enjoy. 
---
You have been hammering at this initiative as any white knight would considering a single person has shown it's possible to make something optimize the game's performance with relatively low effort.

Yes, it needs polishing, no, that's not reason enough to draw the incredibly stupid conclusions you're drawing.

Doesn't look too special, but I'll share nonetheless
---
[Here is mine](https://imgur.com/a/wkw04OS)
---
&gt;Does it force GW2 to use DX12 instead of 9?
---
As far as I understand it, it translates DX9 API calls to DX12 implementations that do the same thing but in a more efficient way.
---
&gt;And other than performance, are there any benefits?
---
Can't think of any.
---
Here's a tip from a "Veteran" of sorts then :D
---
If you replay/play through the story until you would normally enter the purple room (to get the thing from the graveling), you can actually just stop progressing there (even quit the chapter once you pick up the plate), and come back anytime to get a free purple plate (by either going back there, or starting up the chapter again and reloading if you were there already as it won't spawn before your eyes).
---
Its a nice little trick that allows us to save other people plenty of time.
---
Just be sure that if you're letting people TP to Friend to you, that you get up off of the ground as there an anti-load in zone that will kick you out if you load in on the floor. Some good places to avoid this are on top of the doors or any of the sills around the top of the room.
---
Honestly, why isn't this already hanging in the Consortium offices in Lion's Arch?
---
I use the Consortium with bounty glyph in it. Nothing really quite measures up to getting twice as much harvest in half the time. 
---
Ill hold one prize for tomorrow night! :)
---
&gt;I still have 11 gifts of exploration :)
---
My man.
---
thats the one i am having trouble on, ill give it another go since the story is taking me out of that area.
---
it costs 250 hero points per elite spec. You can get 200 from core tyria, 290 from PoF, and 400 from HoT. So while it isn't necessary to complete HoT, it's definitely helpful since each HP in the expansion maps is 10 each
---
It's new and strategies for it have yet to circulate (probably). 
---
i am playing warrior and want to play spellbreaker for WvW so i need the hero points to put points into spellbreaker lol
---
Pretty much better for unbound if you want the quick gather, or volatile if you need the currency. I also like the speedy gathering glyph on a "golf-action" sickle like consortium or molten, as I makes berry farming bitterfrost ninja fast.
---
Now only if Logan came out.  If conservatives complain, Anet can say that his brain was affected by being captured by Mordremoth, because he was the Elder Dragon of Minds.
---
When I did that heart for the first time and encountered a gay couple, I was surprised by how happy it made me. Such a small thing, but it means so much. 
---
Literally all i need, thanks man!
---
I would avoid focusing on Tangled Depths until you've finished the main story. You need to be up the Nuhoch tree, Itxl tree and Glider tree quite a ways to make that map easy to navigate, and the Chak are far harder to deal with than the Mordrem. You can do the story through there easily enough and get through to Dragon's Stand with only a couple hours, but the meta is rough for several of the lesser race scenarios and laning stages.
---
lmao what is this shit
---
Sending you mental tip from across the sea!
---
&gt;Anet devs from the engine
---
How cute to think that anet has a dedicated engine Dev, let alone multiple.
---
It depens. I never looked into it windows and dx stuff but I have a good understanding on how to intercept code in libraries. The d3d9 comes last because it does the render call. but when you intercept it you hook the function, do your stuff and then call the original function. 
---
This new tool will probably intercept all functions, translate them to dx12 calls and just mute the original library. If it is the last in the order it gets dx9 calls and can do its job I assume.
---
As for the cooperative nature of the game, I heard the same complaints about Guild Wars 1 once heroes were introduced, which was with Nightfall. There were plenty of ways to solo almost all the content, and you didn't really need to communicate with your heroes. If the OP wants to talk about this game not having a need for communication except in the most end game content, well that was true for Guild Wars 1 too, and in fact, it was easier in Guild Wars 1, because it wasn't so frenetic. You  had cool downs and for the most part you had to stop to cast. 
---
Most of my communication happens on voice when I play. 
---
I guess the difference here is that you seem to think that a game where you HAVE TO communicate to beat content is better, which I don't think it is. 
---
On the other hand, you can get far more loot and far better at the game with the communication. 
---
Two PvP teams, one without communication and one on voice in a tournament, and who is going to win. 
---
WvW commanders tell you all the time to get into voice. Many don't but many do as well and in WvW guilds it's absolutely expected.
---
Obviously raids and T4 fractals benefit from voices as well, which is why there are now raid training channels on discord.
---
But even lower end Fractals and dungeons benefit from communication, and we can get stuff done faster, if you're not super pro, because people still need to be taught that stuff. There are new people coming to the game finding dungeons to hard to this day. I know it sounds crazy but it's true.
---
There are people complaining about how hard certain elements of the living story are, and, if you're casual (which in my opinion is the vast majority of the playerbase) many of the story achievements benefit having both voice communication and also groups of people doing them.
---
Even when we do stuff like DS or TD or AB metas there's some communication required.
---
In the old days, speed run groups would run dungeons and they'd practice those dungeons to get them faster and faster. People were running some Arah paths in under five minutes. My casual guild never touched five or even ten minutes. We might take 30 minutes to finish the same dungeon.
---
Obviously people who can do content faster make more gold per hour which is how communications helps them in a game l like this.
---
The difference between a communicating pro team going through Raids or T4 fractals and a pug is often night and day.
---
This game benefits plenty from communication. What it doesn't do is force you to communication. 
---
BTW...I agree WvW can use a reward buff, not sure I can comment on PvP. I did find it pretty rewarding when I was doing it last season.
---
TLDR; I believe having a game that doesn't force cooperation but is made better by it is better for a lot of people than a game that requires communication to succeed. It's enough that you can get more rewards faster while communicating.

I'm just pointing out that if that's the way you are going to go about it, you might as well make them even broader so you can mock even more people for "making this theory themselves" :p
---
Though people aren't speculating because they want to claim the "made this theory myself", but because they want to discuss a possibility they've become excited about and see what other people think. That's not your cup of tea, but you comment anyway.

i am comparing those, because fractals are the stepping stone to raids, as even said by devs.  
---
the intended way is to get exp. in fractals, play up and maybe do cm's because you did the normal mode on 99 and 100 and then go into raiding.  
---
i can name a few fractals where pugs start wiping on high level. namely dredge in the first room or at the end, or in the cirty right infront of dulfy. hell, some can't even do swampland.  
---
i would rate those all way more demanding then cairn, mo or samarog.  
---
also, now you say you have a healer in fractals? i tought you dps through to make it a breeze? alone having a healer can make shit harder in those terms. like, what do you want?
---
If you're on a US server, I can help get you through HoT at least to a good percentage of the hero points if you like. It would take a couple of hours if you have the masteries trained. If not maybe a bit longer.
---
HoT is bad if you don't know how to get around it. It's fun as hell for some of us.

Hi, sorry, but what's this all about? 
---
Keep in mind, a show has more than 1 person in it.
---
I get pop-up I click x
---
i dont really understand the appeal of matching them tbh, the physics applied to the backpack tendrils and the shoulder tendrils are completely different; and not in a good way
---
Looks dope. What's dyes are you using on your costume?
---
I wonder why the mentality is so different. A lot of the people that come through my squads tip to show their appreciation for my "efforts" being there (even if I'm afk/not porting at that moment).
---
I guess tips in this regard are essentially just a universal "thank you" but I'm from Australia so I never really understood the reason for tipping employees (not in a "I don't appreciate you" kind of way, but I bought a product which your wages comes from the charge of the goods I purchased), but it makes sense to me to tip someone who's just out and about or going out of their way to help you for no particular reason.
---
Then again, its probably just a similar contrast of culture where, from what I've heard, other countries you clock on then get dressed and ready for work, where here in Australia, you come to work ready and then clock on. Essentially being payed for the hours of effort you put in towards your job either way. With what is considered "Your job" differs from culture to culture.
---
I'd love some insight from the outside, as the only way I justify not tipping someone who's gone out of their way to help me is if I've helped/will be helping them in return. I guess that could just be the cultural/societal expectation along the lines of "Help because you'll be helped/have been helped."
---
Volatile has a very slow animation and gathers less per action (unbound: sickle up to 3 on land and 4 underwater per action - volatile: 1 per action, axe and pick are 4 for unbound and 3 for volatile). 
---
Since you're going for a jucy harvest with glyph of bounty (best glyph for everything except WvW and guild hall), Unbound should be your priority.
---
I thought volatile was the same as unbound while purchasing it for my alt, my worst mistake after gambling with ecto.
---
This, figured since I stopped playing wow 15 bucks a month in gems is the best way.
---
The most played games are all somewhat PvP related: MOBAs, Battle Royale, shooter etc. It's astonishing that GW2 (or only this subreddit?) seems to be a bastion against everything PvP related. Different generation I guess, or not even typical "gamers", whatever that may be. And don't tell me it would be different if sPvP in GW2 would be more fun. It wouldn't, they just hate PvP with a passion.

You'll definitely get this fixed. Funnily enough, Arenanet Support even list this exact same scenario on their support page:

&gt; Here are a few common scenarios when you should contact the support team: You accidentally purchased 1000 instead of 100 Icy Runestones.
---
Thank You so much for help! Now I understand everything.
---
I don't think so. There's plenty of things that are noted to be obnoxious and there already exists the ability to suppress them for individual clients. I don't see why things like that wouldn't be good outside of things like sPvP and tournament modes, personally. The current reductions and effect LoD are very poor.

I can't even tell what in hell you're trying to say because you write like you're 8.

* In Jahai Bluffs, the achievement to unlock the requiem armour has you help a woman whose wife and child were killed.
---
* In Sandswept there's a male and female charr who, if you're on a charr character, are both into you.
---
* Heard there's a charr NPC somewhere who talks about how the Flame Legion killed her girlfriend.
---
* The Bitterfrost quaggan who wants to "hug you all night long" no matter what character you're on.
---
* An NPC in a dungeon as a male voice but female model (or vice versa). Probably a bug but why not assume they're trans?
---
There's other ones I've come across that no one has mentioned, but I can't quite remember them.
---
&gt; I think when interviewed people place it somewhere around 20%
---
Which people?
---
idk about you but the competitive raid tournies are really good entertainment
---
if you already have artificer then it might be cheaper/easier to craft it..the main cost of the collection is the mystic staff(if you already have it unlocked somehow then definitely do collection)
---
i didn't mean deadly 223 but except the part with the 3 at the end you can pick whatever traits really but i would keep revealed training since you can activate it by dodging in your smoke fields from pistol5 or smokescreen for that sweet 200power(133 is optimal dps)
---
for sigils definitely force+x, with x being situational..meta is impact and i would strongly suggest it especially for bosses, even open world ones like chak gerent etc.
---
not sure you know but after you break the breakbar with cc the bosses become "exposed" which increases the damage they receive by 50% for 5s which is the perfect time to press assassin's signet and unload all your damage
---
all these modifiers scale off each other and it's one of the reasons it makes impact such a strong choice
---
if you don't want to run impact then air/night aren't the worst choices..or some slaying sigil maybe
---
also sword pistol is just an example, you should keep a few spare weapons around(can be exotic) for various scenarios, especially 2 daggers since sometimes deadeye will be a better choice
---
not sure why you consider guardian slow, it's kinda middle of the road mobility-wise..you got your f2, your sword 2, your greatsword 3..
---
Bet on your favorite wintrader! 
---
I like her! You totally pulled off the Whispers look even without using their armor set, nice!.
---
no idea what you are looking at, but on my end the tendrils behave pretty similarly. ad even if they didn't, they are still a thematic match, so going for an improvised t2 look seems reasonable.
---
You've got 3 weeks, make it count

 I'm starting to see why now so many go light armor for their legendary set. 
---
Did that with Mill Basins and Gossamer Threads. Took me 2 years to go through them all.
---
Oh, no the production quality is very high. The art direction, music, etc. is all very good. But the gameplay is so formulaic, which is a recurring thing across their franchises. Honestly though, to cut them some slack, it's not just across their franchises, but open world games in general are really formulaic.
---
I feel like a lot of AAA companies try really hard to build these vast, open worlds, but then they don't have enough time to actually flesh them out, so they just fill them with random tat and samey progression milestones. Far Cry 3 had you climb radio towers, Far Cry 4 had you climb radio towers, Far Cry Primal had you light bonfires, Far Cry 5 has you climbing radio towers. Then there's all these small bonus collectibles that are just obvious lazy filler, which is just sad.
---
Like you say, there's a lot of love going into the games, it just sucks that the developers have such time and budget constraints. Granted, if we're being realistic, if they didn't have these time or budget constraints they'd probably never actually finish the games.
---
i made frostfang years ago and after having the nice subtle footsteps of howler for so long; suddenly i had obnoxious long lasting icey ones... massively dampened my enthusiasm to create more legendaries since then; optional footprints would make me want a bunch of the current legendaries
---
people just don't like fun 🤷‍♀️ i tend to buy the expansion HPs for the specs, and keep the core ones for the eventual lulz.

Start doing that then buy gems-&gt;gold.
---
The ones from the shoulders are "stiff" compared to those on the backpiece. If you run in a straight line those on the backpiece straighten while those on the shoulder keep their bent shapes. They use different physics.
---
Sylvari don't always perfectly follow relationships the way we do. They're generally pretty open and can defy a lot of the rigid ways we view relationships.
---
I agree their relationship wasn't overtly mushy like a lot of sylvari (saplings, amirite?) tend to be. But then, a lot of mature relationships aren't. To me, they just felt like a cool, low-key couple.
---
Because the only thing that impacts PvE players from PvP world are some random nerfs that didn't get properly split between different game modes? As in, there's really no "positives", only theoretical expenses (Dev time dedicated to game mode that has shrunk significantly) and negatives. From back when splits were not allowed and "esports" were aggressively pushed as the only thing that matter for game's future. And a lot of drama. And a lot of toxic reaction when pve people do wander into PvP land (that is punctured by occasional whining that so few pve people go into PvP land and how they totally should try it with 90% of encountering GO BACK TO YOUR PVE AND NEVER COME BACK screams during first few matches :) )
---
So... Understandable :) 
---
And then there's WvW which is kinda in-between of not being worthy of PvP-like attention and having own set of problems.
---
Okay, there's a couple of fundamental misunderstandings here I wanna clear up.
---
1. Crafting stations don't have 'their own' bank; they give access to the regular bank, which also has a section for storing materials. Click the cog in your inventory and choose 'Deposit All Materials' to store them.
---
2. To use materials for crafting, the materials need to be (in descending order of convenience) a) in the material storage, b) in a regular bank tab, or c) in the character's inventory.
---
3. They're not suggesting to spread the materials out amongst characters; they're suggesting you spread the various crafting *disciplines* out, since a character can only learn two at a time. This is another reason it's best to store your materials in the bank, because then you don't have to worry about who's carrying what.
---
I don't think they want to. They want people playing casually and coming back every few months because that's how they maximise purchases. If they create more daily repeatable content they need rewards for it.
---
They would rather you log in every two or three months, buy an outfit or mount skin, do the story, then log out. Repeat two or three months later with another purchase (because you didn't earn any by playing - by design) and then repeat.
---
&gt;Commit! It's not hard. If you ain't got the time to stay, why did you join anyway?
---
**Exactly**. I see a lot of raiders complain about pugging because of "bad players" and "low DPS", but honestly? That stuff doesn't bother me at all. What absolutely grinds my gears is people not able to commit for a decent amount of time in a pug. This is the hardest content in the game, and you're being matched with a wide variety of people with different backgrounds and levels of skill. The fact that so many people aren't able to afford some leniency boggles my mind.
---
And then, here's the kicker: when you confront these people, they drop this *bombshell*:
---
"I value my time".
---
Okay, what about the nine people you left who have to look for a tenth person? Don't they value their time too? I'd say that time spent actually fighting the boss and attempting a kill is a lot more valuable than sitting around looking for people, but you just robbed them of that time because you didn't get your miraculous first-try pug attempt. So what if it takes a few attempts? People make mistakes. This is supposedly a game you enjoy; why is it such a big deal to have to play it a little more than you were planning to? Get a grip!
---
Is there any point to 'Door to the Past' achievement in Jahai Bluffs? I spent the last week or so trying to get the runes to drop and unlock the secret door for a new area, and it's just... 3 AP, a fairly inconsequential chest and some plaque fragments? I was hoping for a collection, or a new NPC, or... something interesting.
---
Replay value means earning rewards. One and done updates every two months means you keep them coming back to purchase outfits, weapon skins and mount packs.
---
Do you mind if I take you up on your offer to review VODs? 
---
I liked it. While I'm a fan of Marjory, it's important to continue their stories as people, not only as a couple. We got to spend time with Kasmeer's Kasmeer, not just Marjory's Kasmeer.
---
It took me about a year after HoTs release to commit to mapping the maps. To be honest, I learned the most RUNNING hp trains. People are eager to correct you if they know a more efficient route and you learn a lot as you go. But yeah, tag along on one or two and then try to run one yourself!

I've just replayed the "Act with wisdom but Act" Sylvari storyline recently and it's pretty obvious that Carys and Tegwen are a couple. Honestly, go play through the story yourself as Sylvari. It's a level 20 quest. 
---
Firstly, I doubt they're going to connect raid story and personal story that intricately after all the hub bub that Forsaken Thicket got, and that was barely relevant. So if Dhuum's story ever gets continued, it'd likely be in raids or fractals - the former as a continuation, the later as a prelude. But again, I don't see them continuing it with raids, otherwise that's what w6 would have been.
---
But onto those two specific situations: I wouldn't be surprised if she already can drain him given she modified the ritual to reinforce Dhuum's prison with the power of the Reapers. And Grenth is so far beyond Tyria that I doubt he'd be paying attention to its ongoings anymore. Even Kormir's gone now.
---
It just feels far too strongly like Anet just wanted to wrap up the Dhuum plot and did it in a rushed, haphazard way that was truly unfitting the anticipation for returning to the Underworld and Dhuum.
---
IIRC, Linsey said they were more barebones than the D'Alessio map, which was pretty barebones. So I doubt there would have been anything to really see.
---
Yeah had it on a asura guy in cof. Thought ot was just a super rare bug
---
Thanks! I'll record some gameplay of general open world PvE and instanced content (dungeons/tier 1 fractals) this weekend.

ESO: Does a kegstand

You’ve got some work ahead of you. Make sure you get the daily Machete from the HoT converter (forgetting the name right now), and start doing some dailies in WvW (land claimer, big spender, and master of monuments are super easy). You’ll get reward track potions, and within a few weeks you’ll have the Gift of Battle. Machetes are a pain, as you don’t get enough in the actual meta, and will need to run DS 3-5 times to get enough crystalline ore.

Honestly, this is one of the reasons I love the sylvari so much. They are one of the few good representations of asexuality in modern media. They have gender, but lack the capabilities to have sex. Even so, they are still romantically attracted to others. Usually, when media tries to represent asexual characters, they always make the character lack both sexual and romantic attraction, and that is far from the truth for many (if not most) asexuals. 
---
When the community was going back and forth about what sylvari should look and act like on the gw2guru, there was a lot of thought put into how and why plants would have a gender at all and many people settled on the idea that all sylvari would be asexual, but take on the appearance of gendered humans because they were stealing from the human template. I am really, really glad this made it into the game.
---
For reference, I cannot seem to find the old Anet post with discussion on this, but the wiki backs me up here: 
---
&gt; Sylvari gender is selected by the Pale Tree prior to each individual's emergence, and is distinguished by the same general features as human genders, although they lack reproductive capabilities... Romance is practiced among the sylvari, disregarding gender between those involved.

Thank you for clearing it up! I only store materials on my “mule” because the mats bank is full - for example I have 12 elderwood stacks (250) sitting on my toon, with whom I plan to craft.
