The down voting issue described by the OP is more of a “group think” issue.  
---

---
I’m generally one of those people that try to make every post an “effort post”.  I put a lot of effort into my posts with detailed reasoning and analysis.  I even try to draw on my past experiences with software development and IT Service Management. 
---
That being said, whenever I’ve made a post on why I don’t like HoT, it gets heavily down-voted.  Whenever I make a post on what ANET does wrong in software development, it gets heavily up-voted.  In all honestly, the up-voting and down-voting has been extremely consistent.  It’s sort have gotten to the point where I can predict which posts get up-voted and which get down-voted based on topic alone.
---
To be fair, this is an issue that most reddit pages suffer from.  For example the Legend of Zelda reddit pages generally down-vote anyone that doesn’t rate Ocarina of Time as their favourite Zelda game.  In an attempt to combat this, the True Zelda reddit page literally a sticky thread that basically says “it ok to have a different opinion”.  
---
It’s probably worth mentioning that from a software development perspective, the game is continuously changing.  If a new user asks a question, there’s a good chance the answer in a previous thread with the answer might be out of date or misleading due to a change in the code.  A good example of this would be the recent change to stat selectable gear.  There’s probably hundreds of previous posts that are now out of date due to that system change. 
---
Lastly if someone asks a question, it doesn’t hurt to answer it using the latest information.  You can save that person a lot of time by doing so.  For example I recently hooked up my Top Loader NES to a modern TV.  It’s literally taken me years to do this due to the large amount of out of date or misleading information such as “the only way to hook up Top Loader NES is via a VCR”.  If anyone is curious, you basically need an RF female to RCA phono male adapter, a male to male RF cable and a TV that supports the “ATV format” (basically any TV made in the last few years or earlier).  If your using a Samsung HD TV then there isn’t a button to switch to ATV mode, you have to retune the channels to ATV.

Wow and I thought getting a shiny a weapon from the first cache I opened was nothing special.

I then opened 6 more and got nothing but Luck, so been selling them on TP since.
---
These drop rates really are terrible.

My buddy currently plays a pure 70 Bard in xiv. No other classes unlocked, no DoH/DoL either.
---
The best thing to do in this game is a variety of content. If you find yourself only doing one kind of content, you will either get really frustrated with the game or play it only occasionally or casually. If you instead, play a variety of content, the game is the game that never stops giving

&gt;
---
&gt;* Raid: Adina: Seismic Suffering: "Confusion" was doing more damage than expected on this ability so a change was made to make "Confusion" not do any damage on skill activation.
---
&gt;* Fixed an issue causing the Glyph of Alchemy to reward unexpected materials when equipped to the Unbound Magic Mining Beam or Unbound Magic Harvesting Blast gathering tools.

Seems like im lucky, i can queue pvp again. So a bit of waiting did the trick, although there might be other players in that match that reported to support. Who knows. I don't care, i can play pvp again :D
---
Wait they dont? I'm not a raider but I assumed there was some story or stuff there I'm missing lol

Try to join party with someone and that guy triggers new queue. You need to accept it -&gt; now you can cancel and are free.

If that won't work, you need devs to help you (easiest is on forum or directly ticket)

Let me know if you're still looking for help, more than happy to run people through to get the first mount.

The three East Asian countries got a love-hate relationship for cultural, historical, and political reasons (depends on the individual, as you totally have weebs in Korea and China while you have people who would refuse having anything to do with Japan). 
---
Having Japan attack and conquer them was a huge blow to Chinese and Korean pride, before that time they were seen as lower civilized people and pirates. They weren't dismantled and forced to really apologize like Germany had to (the same political party is still in power); they did apologize a few times, but there is always a high ranking politician ruining things (publicly saying it wasn't like that, or going to Yakusuni Shrine), or paid a repair fee/donation (but the funds were often used by the government and not given to direct victims).
---
actually, there are aspects of your point I agree with. The daily system, for example, kind of puts a soft limit on how much it's worth your while to actually play the game. Fractals, for instance, don't really have much of a reason to be played more than 3 times a day, which can be frustrating if you actually wanna just take a day to sit down and no-life fractals with some friends for that day, or even play fractals for 2 hours rather than 1. Now, you *could* play fractals all day, if you wanted, but for most of us, it's just not attractive enough to do that. A system *designed* to get you coming in and playing, kind of has the opposite effect. It kind of depends on whether you see the daily chests as critical to the reward structure, or just as a bonus thing.
---
That said, I point back to my earlier point in a previous comment: This is why the game is better played as a variety game, than specifically attempting to only play one kind of content. This is a game that has massive quantity of content in a diverse amounts of modes. Fractals, raids, casual exploration, adventures, races, meta events, achievement quests, story, pvp, and wvw. If you play all of them, you're basically never bored.
---
HOWEVER, all this is kind of beside the point of the OP. The events they were talking about weren't time gated or have some sort of limit on them. In fact, if I recall correctly, the events were LIFTING limits from the content they were associated with. So, if you were inclined, you could play the content as much as you'd like and get rewarded.
---
For me I personally like eloquent, elaborate and intricate weapons with a few effects, but minimal. Still waiting :c... More a like than high quality though. Quite a few of the non particle effect bl weapons are nice and decent quality IMO. I wish they'd stop making branded things already though.
---
Stop joining pugs and find a guild or something.
---
Congratulations, you've successfully defended lazy coding and something that doesn't even affect you. I wonder how many college degrees it takes to reach this level of apologist. Truly a wonder.
---
I've been waiting for support to help me for the exact same problem. It's been three months and two tickets submitted and haven't heard a peep. It's been highly discouraging.
---
Should we really need to do this level of out-of-game prep just to be able to participate in content? And people wonder why there's like one raid a year

Playing a spellbreaker in conquest, how come I can't deal damage to anyone and they kill me almost instantly? Using this build https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Spellbreaker_-_Strength_Dagger

Are they still obtainable? That's glorious.

Or are they, more likely, like the missing hairstyles from beta days that're still "there" but completely unobtainable?
---
I'd love to join.

I can bring DH and DD right off the bat, and tag out on Chrono if you get tired of playing it. I'm also familiar with most of the speed tactics outside of fights (let's be real; the only speed tactic *inside* of fights is max DPS), so I can inform on those.
---
**its neither ironic nor an oversight that they make PvE content harder and flashier but refuse to accommodate visibility problems outside of WvW and PvP.** 
---
This is because people who play WvW and PvP dont waste their screen visibility on overly-flashy and bright cosmetics because it hurts their ability to play, and there is a much more serious need to be able to read everything on screen clearly. PvE is **designed** for eye-sore cosmetics, because the truth is Anet will never make PvE content hard enough to justify needing to see what you're doing from their point of view, and people who play casually or to show off don't care that they can barely see as long as they arent dying too much
---
That would be an answer to the question "is the impact greater than 0%". The question however was whether the impact is material.
---
Yeah, I guess I have to acknowledge this is the reality. Like I said in another comment, just edit it for the Chinese release with all Chinese names like WoW censored undead
---
Weird thought.... But what other people do has zero impact on my fun levels. Just beucase someone can do or does something doesn't mean I have to. In fact, I put a decent amount of IRL money into the game... But I put even more TIME into farming, unlocking, doing and enjoying. All the while putting liquid gold into gems to the point I can get whatever I want from the gem store. And at the same time most of what I use still comes from the game itself. 
---
I give not a single fuck about what other people think about me. I get what I want for my own pleasure... because here's the thing I play the game to have fun, because it's fun.
---
What was the new emote?

Maybe once you get a live person they can eyeball it and if it's close enough then they'll give you access.

They could do that alongside dynamic scaling for the amount of players, from 10 players to 24 players, or something. Though I’m sure that’s a fucking hell of a task for the developers to tune correctly, it would alleviate a lot of the headache of organizing an exact number of people so you could just bring who you have. It would be especially nice and useful for a community event so you wouldn’t have to leave out that one extra person in your guild who might want in for the rewards.
---
It definitely alleviated a lot of the headache around raiding in WoW, since we didn’t have to leave out that one extra player just because we already had our 10/25 players online.
---
Because fuck you that's why. Fuck your eyes, fuck your FPS.
---
&gt; Dragons Stand is one of em, Domain of Istan is another.
---
And that's only because both maps had sections cut.
---
That seems to be the case.
---
If GW1 is any indication... you're gonna be waiting .... forever. Also you can certainly use all lore-rich stuff. There is A LOT of it. But why should what you want trump what others want? No one is making you use it. Perhaps you have to 'see' it on others but such is the life of an MMO. You know what I hate seeing? Eye-blinding clashing colors and effects for days... but it's not my character so I just move away.
---
I don't WvW, really, but firebrands are good support for it from what I know. Dragonhunter is solid DPS for phased fight raids. Guardian can comfortably solo as well. 
---
Yes, mesmer has an ungodly meta support in raids as well as power and condi DPS variants, but I don't think you'd be at all disappointed running guardian if you like support roles.
---
Probably need friends who double as decent raiders to help you out tbh, doesn't have to be a static, but pugs can be hit or miss and usually they are big misses honestly. I don't usually complain about low DPS from pugs since it's really not hard to pull off the DPS to clear raids, it's more that all the pugs randomly die to mechanics. multiple times. It's like they don't learn.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for the kp thing, I understand why people do it since they want the kill ASAP on release, but it's funny because even before 24hrs of release, people are expecting to know mechanics with kp. ?? The release is in the middle of the night for some people, at the 18hr mark after release, many people are literally about to try it for the first time. People need to chill lol. (If you're not a confident raider, you could always watch videos of how people have been doing it, but if you're serious about clearing ASAP, you'd be doing that already)
---
In all honesty, these bosses aren't hard though, it's like the w4 of PoF raids at this point. The hardest part about raids is as always, finding enough people decent enough to actually do them. You could also just modify your build slightly to deal with the mechanics, decreases DPS a little but makes it a cake walk. If you are actually good raiders, you'll easily clear standard raids even with "poor" performing classes compared to the highest DPS classes.
---
&gt; Pugs are a luck game. You either get shit or you get a really cool experience. 
---
It's exactly like gambling, you usually get the shit.

Nodes from EVERY Single boss in a 24h period EXCEPT shadow behemoth. 2 days in a row of no node there.

---
I still actually thought the plan was for Aurene to act as a living filter for all spectrum so they can be safely harmonic to the planet and ultimately, a new governing body would be a representation with limitations so things stay in balance.
---
Zhaitan's Death/Shadow Spectrum would go to Palawa Joko, but he would be unable to kill anyone, only resurrect as minions. Also, he would be blind and require "eyes" to see the world around him.
---
Mordremoth's Mind/Plant would go to the Pale Tree, but there would be no Mother entity that which it could speak. All Sylvari would act as the minions, as intended, but they would know and feel the world when in crisis.
---
Kralkatorrik's Crystal/Brand would stay strictly with Aurene. She developed the crystallization, thus, she would be the only one to use it, which it would strictly exist only to mend catastrophic infliction to the world. Branding is now "Mending".
---
Primordius/Jormag don't care/too tired, but not much could be done for the minions. Balance would still need a form of conflict, but it is a sustainable and could be stabilized.
---
Thus leaving our mysterious Water Dragon. Why is in hiding? Is it waiting for everything to boil over before making a move? Find out in Season 5!?
---
How about at the tarnished traitor after the AB meta?  Those 50 dead people on the chest are a result of FPS.
---
&gt; To tackle it, I recently deleted all alts except my main. I haven’t regretted it for a second.
---
\*stares horrified in birthday presents*
---
The issue seems to be that Great Jungle Wurm and Shadow Behemoth share the same node, so whichever one of those two that you do second won't have a node drop.  Something to keep in mind to save time until it's fixed.
---
They are still obtainable but require 2 total makeover kits to get. You need to switch sex twice in order to get them. Unless of course you want to change to a different sex and keep it that way

Just get the Dx12 patch it's ridiculous how much better it makes the game run.

I tested 80% final but that was before the SoI nerfs. Really you should just hit 85% (after food/utility) so you cap at 100% with 150AR now if you're going for boon duration and pug runs. If running more AR you can adjust as needed. Fractals are hard to give a number for in general as well since good groups can pre-stack boons then swap to literally full DPS chrono and be fine since they finish the fight fast enough. Note that you shouldn't be taking Inspiration in fractals, you don't need a second main-hand sword (the first one fills in if empty), impact sigils will be better in fractals but if you want to keep it the same for raids force is fine, you can swap one earring to diviners and overcap by a little or just leave it at 80% (+15% from potions) though there are ways to min/max more.
---
This is what I hate about this game. If I want something I have to follow guide upon guide.
---
I just looked up gw2 hook and it says it is not clean code right on website.
---
Also, it needs to use native render sampling, but I need to usesupersaming for my large monitor. 
---
Thus, easy decision from them to Not adopt the code.
---
I won't pre-order, but the specs are amazing.  I fully expect to pull the trigger after the real benchmarks hit.
---
Ahh, that's not official though :(
---
this person sounds unpopular
---
What sells more gets more stuff
---
Something along the lines of difficult achievement collections that give an aura similar to the 2 SAB infusions. On top of that, allow other players to toggle off auras. Achievements should make the individual player feel good without the need of others praising them; requiring self praise from others is not a healthy trait psychologically speaking.
---
Haven't done this content yet, so...  
---
Question: Is there anything artificially pegging the minimum value of the Djinn Energy Cluster?
---
I'm asking this because if the market price is wholly influenced by supply and demand, then 1.) the drop rate could very well be as intended by ArenaNet and 2.) it is a matter of sellers simply pricing it way above its true value.
---
Well, kudos to the OP for putting in the resources to determining the value of the Cluster for the benefit of the community.
---
Awesome! I appreciate the heads up :)
---
You would be surprised how many mmo players are driven by the need to fit in, socially, by accomplishing things and showing off they did them to others.
---
&gt;Snowcrows says to play 7 power chronos, 1 bs, 1 druid, 1 alacrity rev at Xera. I bet you 10g no one has ever done this in pugs. 
---
Because...that comp is intended to be an optimal comp for a hardcore static that has the coordination and alts to allow that specific comp to be viable for them to fulfill. Of course that doesn't reflect what happens in PUGs. That's not what it's there for.
---
Their raid builds themselves are entirely different and includes every single class, no matter how off-meta, and rotations and general gameplay tips. Recommending those to PUGing noobs is fine (great, even, it's a great jumping off point to learn more).
---
Maybe it would sell more if it was actually available for purchase in the first place.
---
Perhaps with powerful multi-cores, however with my i5-6600 (quad core, no hyperhtreading) there were no gains, the opposite actually.
---
I think the crux of the issue is that there is a lack of incentive to cooperate with other players in GW2 Raiding.  
---
Most MMOs generally have a variety intuitive mechanics and raid wide utilities to encourage cooperation amongst the raid community.  For example in WoW, all classes have raid wide utilities and raids are generally designed to intuitively encourage cooperation.  Additionally there are numerous rewards and cosmetic gear that encourage casual players to participate in raids.  During WoW Legion, there were more PUG groups for cosmetic gear than there was for actual progression.  
---
It is my understanding that the things above are largely missing in action in GW2 raiding.  In all honesty, this is more of a game design issue and less of a community issue.
---
To be fair the leveling and story pre 50 content is sooooo absurdly slow and riddled with boring fetch quests I’m honestly surprised so many actually play it.
---
If you're a younger asian that grew up overseas this is the likely viewpoint. 
---
I know a lot of older folk who completely hate each other and will shout at strangers simply because they're from a different country. As soon as they hear their language let's say Japanese, they'll start shouting at them telling them to go die. 
---
I also know people who were highly discriminated due to being Chinese living in Japan.
---
Ive also wondered about the Sylvari. They are essentially identical to Aurene. My guess is, going with your theory, the Dream is the connection the Sylvari would have to collectively use to purify magic
---
Lol me too I love my mains sooo much I've only done the first lvl 10 story for other characters
---
Okay thanks
---
There have been darker/more serious skins. But they dont sell half as well as the bright, whimsical ones
---
Because once you hit 50 and get passed the fetch quests it's one of the best games out there. But I'm not blind to the frustration it puts on new players so I understand the criticisms
---
So used to playing gw2 that the GCD and oGCD system in FFXIV felt so jarring to me. The only class that I enjoyed playing there was red mage
---
I got up to the current gearscore till about six months ago... ish. I played WHM, PLD, and BRD. The rotations, especially for tank, are extremely boring and blocking big attacks comes down to remembering the names of them among all the random convoluted other attacks. People play FFXIV for the lore not the combat. A very small group of individuals really love maxing everything and getting the highest possible dps (savage/extreme). The hard part of combat is literally just moving around according to the skills the enemy is using.
---
Anet legit owes this man a rollback wtf.
---
At least I can use abilities on allies instead of having to look in their direction :p
---
Nice! My friend and I were just wondering what she eats. I thought it’s a steak or maybe a volatile magic.
---
as much of a pain as this is i would rather them turn up the latency tolerance. ive monitered my network during peak hours and literally one or two dropped packets and boom, im disconnected. literally every other game i play just gets a little lag spike and im right back at it.
---
Before the nerfs, Heal Rev was an unstoppable 2v1 cap holder that shot my skill level through the roof; that's a strange coincidence.
---
OH GOD THE MACROS. EVERYTHING about FFXIV beats Gw2 EXCEPT the combat.
---
You're right, thanks for clarifying!
---
Sigh. I'm trying my best to avoid buying this mount... &gt;_&gt;
---
this is so fun! great video, love this sort of content
---
I love that this discussion exists! As I've picked up FFXIV only recently. GCD felt slow for me to be able to enjoy the combat in the game, but that feeling went away really quickly when I learned more and more skills that are not bound to GCD. I'm really enjoying FFXIV more and more now. And it helps that the engine runs really good for me compared to GW2.
---
I've noticed that my PC takes much longer to load in textures with the dx12 patch. Is there anything to fix that? For reference I'm running an i5-8400 with a GTX 2060
---
oh i didnt know i'll do that.
---
So a 3% chance for the ley essence ... uncommon seems to be a bit of an understatement
---
Wait, you don’t need a macro for that, you don’t need to turn and face people, just target them.  Your character will automatically turn to face them when the ability is used.
---
Not to mention macros should be used incredibly sparingly in combat, they all introduce heavy delay into rotations due to they 1/sec limit on macro actions.  Stuff like making a ground target AoE cast at your targets feet and res macros are fine since they don’t really slow you down, but macros for combat abilities are a bit iffy.
---
The idea would be that each weapon gets a new set of 5 skills with martial art style.  
---
Attunements would no longer give you five new skills per weapon, but would give extra effects to your current skills.  So if you are using a staff you don't have 20 skills, you have 5 and the attunement you are just add different effects to them.  
---
Fire (sustained dmg) usually deals high dmg and apply burns, water (evasion and heal) usually have an evade or heal, air (control and burst) would have increased crit dmg and some stuns, and earth (defense a d control) would have some blocks and debuffs.
---
So if you use a skill in a certain attunement it would have slightly different effects than in others but would still be the same skill (one CD, same animation, etc).
---
Nice editing! Would love to see more.

I gotcha, I had to read it a few times to fully comprehend.  That is a pretty big departure from ele, but I'd give it a shot.
---
Ye but gw2 runs specially bad for some reason.
---
  
---
Like wow got a huge performance update and even before that it ran way better than gw2... Same for eso and warhammer online ran also better even aion were running better.
---
It's a bit different than what I said due to hitting max in HW and only 3 are max in SB (one being my main with all 70s except craft/gatheres aren't done yet), 2 are freshly into HW and one just started SB.
---
I could post their classes/search info
---
A bit more explanation of the plan before hand would probably help make them funnier when they inevitably fail.
---
There is actually going to be a season 2 from what I heard. There are just two movies being released now that summarize the plot of the first season, and maaaaybe a few bits from the beginning of season 2.
---
I would use that patch, but I don't want to risk ANet deciding one day that it's ban-worthy because \*insert obscure bullshit reasoning here\*.
---
I prefer my entire codebase in a single file personally.
---
&gt;I'm not exactly out here clamoring for an option to convert asura models to standard ones though am I?
---
You literally have such an option.
---
&gt;It's an issue because the anti infusion circle jerk is so toxic and annoying. There was an instance last week where someone said a due job looked like shit because it used an infusion.
---
Having an opinion is toxic now? That was me btw. You say more and more ridiculous things as time goes on.
---
grenth is the god of ice and death, he would be most fitting for jormag
---
Salvaging gear gives most of the scraps. Leather is dropped the least, but not impossible to get.
---
You do not need to craft anything before lv.80. Literally can equip any garbage gear you loot. If you enjoy craft there is a lot to keep you occupied much later in a game. Arguably crafting is not as much important in gw2, since high end gear can be obtained from multiple sources avoiding craft. Much later in the end game, if you tag along for long enough, you might find yourself crafting only to unlock skins, not obtainable elsewhere, which I personally really enjoy.
---
I will never understand why gw2 community has such poor taste. Everything has to look like rainbow vomit. Rather have a galaxy effect on a griffin rather than textures. Who needs textures anyways.
---
You know, certain enemies are likely to drop bags that give more of specific mats (e.g. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Supply_Bag)? And there's a lot of challenge runs to 80 you could do (deathless, never using gear at rare or better rarity, etc., it's really easy to set arbitrary rules to make it harder/appealing in different ways.
---
It's honestly more complex than in GW2 in the end. It's also not filled with skills that you'll never use because classes are designed to have a certain kit instead of having 10000 useless skills. I guess it's a double edged sword for GW2, it's kind of fun trying out all kinds of skills, but you never actually learn to raid with a class by just trying it out by yourself.
---
Would go back to Rift if it wasn't a graveyard. Last time I played I hardly see anyone in Rift invasions/world map. How is it now?
---
Try plus and country code in there. But as others said in regards of non authorized re seller, avoid cdkeys for gw2
---
Might never occur, but once you need to prove anet you have purchased the key what would you do...
---
It just not sticky atm,  but still out there
---
I asked some people anf all said the same... i need to be lvl 80, so whats the workaround?
---
Holy shit I forgot you existed. I really wish I could've kept it that way too. Way to comment on month old videos :\^)

Ah, no.. There were a few tokens that I'd missed as well. I shall get them added tonight. If anyone does spot anything else missing, add a comment here, on our discord server or give me a shout in-game (UK evenings usually) as Leaky.1472
---
Yes it is laughable how poorly optimized gw2 is.
---
Just look at warframe for example, same buisness model, about same launch date. They bring out optimization tunes with each patch.
---
Why can't anet do that?
---
more like theyre very good at making them unrewarding
---
That feeling when the meme I made 11 days ago turned out to be true...
---
[From another angle](https://imgur.com/a/aBynG8T), it's definitely a mushroom.
---
Im playing with an i7 9700k on 4.7ghz all core and 2080 ti. Easy 50-60 fps in world events/WvW with everything on max except character model limit
---
I completely understand.  ARR was, for the most part, a super "safe" generic story about some fresh of the boat adventurer who turns out to be the big hero that everyone was waiting for...  There was no rise to really glory, as we just walk straight into the spotlight; and the enemies hardly feel threatening.  Hell, we end up killing several "gods" without much thought being put into it.  The scope and impact of these battles feels tiny(despite npcs treating these things like the bringers of the end times), and this holds true until the Ultima Weapon.  Now that was a battle.  The steady build up, the destruction.  The power of the opponent that we the players can actually see and feel, not just be told about in some exposition dump.  After that theres a bit of a slowdown leading into Heavensward, but anyone who survives ARR is in for a high fantasy themed treat...  Then there was Stormblood.  Introduced some of my favorite characters, dungeons, and primals, but the story was not quiet Heavensward.
---
Huh?  Most attacks are telegraphed in GW2 as well, though.  Sure some enemies use non telegraphed attacks... but that’s true for FFXIV as well.  The only thing really unique to GW2 is that there’s unavoidable hits you have to dodge through at times as well
---
I have a Ryzen 1700 and RTX 2080Ti. And as we all know the Ryzen line-up isn’t the best for single-threading peformence. My friend with a 1050 gets more FPS
---
It's amazing. Although sometimes things load in a bit weird but only for a second
---
This is what happaned to me. I gave it a try, picked Thamaturgist, I think? I played it for a week but just couldn't go any further; I was just so bored, running through loads of empty beginner areas while I seemed to be the only person there.
---
&gt; how many mmo players are driven by the need to ~~fit in~~ dominate, socially,
---
FTFY
---
GW2+Chrome+Streamlabs (even with NVENC encoding) = RIP
---
4670k + GTX1070
---
It's painful, and probably the thing that'll make me quit the game when I finally do.
---
Unfortunately, all I can say is good luck. 
---
My nephew (who lived with us at the time, now has grown up and moved out) has been trying to recover his account for several months. We have the email address used to register it, serial key, and character name(s), but because he lost the password to the email address from registering 6 years ago he's SOL.... 
---
Again, good luck :(
---
Try to delete activationdata.xml in taco folder or rather just freshly downloaded taco:-)
---
I've tied those nodes to map reset behavior but with the nature of the Dragonfall, it sometimes bugging itself. I will make an updated version without that behavior, check downloads later today:-)
---
Because optimization is an afterthought
---
So far in my training runs for Adina i've been advising the workaround: zoom the camera way in before you cast ground targets, especially if you're using ventari bubble / feedback / WoR / etc projectile hate during the hands phase.
---
Agreed. Repeatable CMs that are worth doing, even if it is just the ascended materials, are sorely needed and the difficulty of this wing proves it. There is nothing here to keep people playing once they've cleared the, relatively easy, content.
---
Other MMOs can get away with this for a patch or too because they offer gear progression and that makes playing the rest of the game - questing, dungeons, open world - more satisfying due to an increase in player power. Guild Wars 2 doesn't have that.
---
That was proven false soon after the author released the source code. You can read about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ajp187/source_code_for_d912pxy_is_up/)
---
Honestly one of the reasons why I don't play the game anymore and only log in sometimes. Give me all the excuses you want, but litteraly any other videogames, including mmos, runs at 60fps with high or sometimes even ultra settings and gw2 struggles to reach 30 on low, often dropping below 20. Trash optimization
---
I have redownload several times, but will try deleting that file, thanks!
---
That's a quality research!
---
I disagree with that personally. The times to first kill would backup wing 7 being easier than wing 6 but we will only know for sure in the coming weeks and more of the player base has attempted the content.
---
So far there seems nothing comparable to normal Largos Twins which is an absolute noob stomper with a firm best composition or the role complexity of Qadim CM (which isn't even that complex for what it is worth!).
---
The tags atract random players that want to follow a zerg. If you tag up for your 15 to 20 man guild group you don't reakly want additional random people around because more often than not they just act as rallybots for your opponents.
---
&gt;waiting for training communities 
---
You don't need to wait, on [Raid Academy](https://discord.gg/mpVnEju) we had like five Wing 7 trainings today.
---
Pugging is toxic and full of anxiety. Joining a friendly community like Raid Academy will go a long way, not just in terms of teaching you bosses but in allowing you to enjoy raid content in a friendly, low-pressure environment.
---
When you say "nodes" do you mean actual in-game gathering nodes or TacO markers? Many of the latter disappear if you press F at their location as a kind of "daily completion checklist" feature. Restarting TacO *without* restarting GW2 should be enough to bring them back.
---
response times better than anet support team's
---
Quickness, yes.
---
Alacrity, no.
---
You should aim for 100% BD for fractals (with pots and food) and also learn how to precast properly. Proper knowledge of certain fights is also necessary in order to know when to put wells etc.
---
Yes I mean the actual in-game nodes
---
Something that always surprises me is that people will argue *against* renovating the early game experience because "making it too complicated will put people off". 
---
Zone meta events are half the end game. That's literally why some people play. Until you get to Orr, the base game is just very flat. At launch, it had Season 1 to keep things interesting, but now they're just zones with occasional boss fights. Yes, some heart quests are nice mini-games, but the sense of narrative isn't there.
---
I've uploaded a new pack without that behavior, try it out:-) You should still delete that activationdata.xml before you run it (just once, taco will recreate it)
---
Exactly what I was thinking. I hope they come up with something new and refreshing. Just like gliding and mount, maybe Season 5 will bring us something new to progress our mastery level. I don't want player housing. I do if it was something extra, but not in place of gliding and mounts. I have no idea what player housing could bring to the table. It's just an instance per player that you can decorate, what else is there to it? We'll see what they come up with. I wouldn't mind another mount, if it's different from the rest, but I have a feeling it'll start feeling "boring" and "easy".
---
How long have you been using it? I personally noticed that most of the issues tend to slowly go away overtime if you continue to use it (currently the only thing I really notice is a texture bug on the skyscale which makes the saddle turn completely black, otherwise I can't think of any problems with it)
---
Not always. I asked a question ,and I had searched the history for an answer first. All I got was 2 comments , and downvotes. And both comments were just complaints.
---
I hate infusions aura, always try to never use them, but I bought ghostly infusion and also got a drop for them, equip it while animation is set to low so no ghastly effect appear, never realize how annoying the aura on my characters were after I put the setting to medium lol.
---
Wow's engine is even older. And it looks worse than gw1.
---
It actually made my FPS tank due to the way it redistributes whatever computer goblins it uses to paint the pictures really quickly on the screen. My CPU isn't beefy enough for it. 
---
Witcher 3, Dying Light etc all run fine, though.
---
I'd like to see an under water mount the most.
---
But did you prtsc?
---
Should have lol
---
&gt; You legitimately think making skins is THAT easy?
---
dafuq? No, I don't think making skins is easy at all. Where on earth did you get that impression? Bizarre...
---
GG Anet
---
Airships are next.  I am the pact commander and should have unlimited access to my own personal airship.   
---
The airship would allow for fast and free travel between a hand full of spots on the map for a party of five(or maybe a rotating list based on dailies?).   They could also incorporate air battles that are required for the first 10 uses, after which they are optional.  These battles would have a small list of achievements associated with them and a slight chance of dropping unique skins.  
---
And of course they is a lot of other stuff that could be done with this that I have not even thought of.
---
gw2 launch did flop... most players quit after a month and did not live up to the expectations at all.
---
Why are you using a macro that faces you toward a person and casts, instead of a mouseover macro that targets the cast on whoever your mouse is hovering over at the time you use the spell, with "turn to face target when using skills" disabled in the options?
---
In any case...
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt; EVERYTHING about FFXIV beats Gw2 EXCEPT the combat.
---
*Uh.. about that..* 
---
GW2 mounts blow XIV's out of the fucking water. Having your chocobo fight alongside you as a party member is good, but not nearly as good as the rest of GW2's mount design.
---
Dye system blows XIV's out of the entire dimension. No contest, end of discussion.
---
Toys and trinkets (not stat trinkets, the fun ones like boxes o' fun, bobblehead labs, kites, etc) don't even exist in XIV. XIV's minions are better than GW2's minis though. XIV doesn't give you chairs like GW2, although it does let you sit properly on benches and things whereas GW2's all "everything is the ground."
---
Musical instruments function dramatically better than XIV's (you can't even play chords in XIV) although XIV has the better UI for them.
---
The early-game story is better than XIV's which takes until around Lv40 to finally start getting decent but doesn't stop being slow until almost Lv50 (but gets slow again for a while right after).
---
Dynamic events beat FATEs, Meta-events don't even exist in XIV. 
---
FFXIV doesn't even have SAB, ffs.
---
That being said, I agree that XIV does a lot of things well. Probably why I continue to pay them $22/month for a full subscription and four extra retainers. They need to get their shit together where those $18 outfits are concerned, though.
---
I would personally like to see limited trails, but it's fine without them. The wings have a pretty good blur effect, especially when they speed up to lift the hummingbird higher.
---
Can the speed in which the raid was cleared, both normal and CM, and the fact that SC members and Teapot and some other guilds still posted their own threads be used as a learning experience that a pinned thread for first kills isn't needed? 
---
I said it before the release of Wing 7 and I'll say it again, Guild Wars 2 does not support raiding that allows for progression competition or races.
---
Just let those that clear quickly make their own threads.
---
I never take people who ask for KP on week 2 seriously.  They just wanted to be carried.
---
Old meme
---
It's kinda ok. But seriously the only battle Royale out there that is really ridden with aimbots.
---
And iam not quick to say someone cheats I saw in the last 10 years ( If I exclude gtav cause it's ridden with hackers online) like 7 cheater (excluding also csgo br I alone saw there like 8) and I play like nonstop mp in many different games. 
---
Otherwise it would be kinda fun some genuine new ideas like having a buy menu and drone delivery.
---
thread wars 2's bottleguild is the main neck
---
Maybe they shouldn't have hired George R.R. Martin to write it.
---
what was the question?
---
I wonder what would be the results of using the glyph in WvW. Gathering synthesizers are random in nature, so probably would be useful for the type of node that guarantees higher price the higher tier material is, like leather.
---
It's under the pavement, silly
---
This image taken most likely somewhere in post-soviet space. This is how most of construction done here. Expensive, slow and far from quality.
---
Was quite an eye opener when I was working in USA on tennis court repairs with Mexicans in my early 20s...
---
I am tho, Standard models exist in WvW and PvP, it is not the "lower details" option, this way you see everyone as human with 1 armor set per class.
---
Theres a number of games that do multi-threading well.
---
However, most of the time its consoles that actually sees true Multi-threading. While PC gets the lazy version.
---
And the other part is that the main thread will ALWAYS do more work. This is because by API design, the main thread is often the one responsible for rendering calls, event handling. Work dispatch. Synchronous tasks. Etc.
---
Yeah but not out yet
---
Realistically, you can't renovate the early game experience in game like this anymore. Is it Wow, FFXIV, or Guild Wars 2, we can believe that it's too much energy for not that much gain.
---
Gameplay wise, there's a flat progression from level 20 to level 80. The "skill tree", combined to the fact you have utility skills that takes sense in groups, or against players, will makes new player use more likely the combo attack alone, and the gameplay then fails for the whole first 80 levels. A big part of a new player experience. Exploration, hearts, or even just knowing the high level content might be enough to keep some, but no wonders as to why FFXIV is more successful : The hard GCD is a problem only early game, and once you hit level 30, the "job" part makes it's effect, and refresh a bit your gameplay. Story wise, you have your class quest every ten level, but the main story is available all along your journey, as a red wire leading you to the end game. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I love Guild Wars 2, because the map completion thing is my thing, and I could level to 80 without even doing the story. But I doubt many people like that. My wife couldn't get into it, even before level 20, because of the lack of that red wire once you're out of personal story. "You're new ? Do things for yourself for the 10 level coming, I'll then entertain you a bit, then you'll do the same, for 80 levels".
---
YO THIS IS FUCKING D O P E
---
btw I recommend trying the Spearmarshal legs &amp; Corsair legs (from Ep.5 meta achievement) just to see what they look like
---
1. I did not imply that you are poor irl.
---
2. There is nothing wrong with being poor irl.
---
3. Since you are happy to be on this side of the gold-gem exchange (which is fine, so am I often enough), why be an ass to the people on the other side, who make being on this side viable?
---
That sounds a lot like 'murican ThE CosTumeR iS AlwAys rIghT to me. I mean, I get what you're saying. But if the reality of things doesn't influence your opinion of a thing, it's kind of ... strange. And somewhat scary.
---
I guess skyscale adds hovering , but the rest of it's features can be done with Springer and Griff. Hell, before I had Griff, I would even use bond of vigor + skimmer to glide long distances .
---
Hrm, see, I would say FF14 combat is sluggish, but it's not like GW2 is any better, just very different:
---
* Incredibly spammy.
---
* Visually unprocessable due to massive f/x clutter and a graphics engine not suitable for the combat they picked.
---
* Abilities themselves are overloaded via a plethora of secondary effects coupled with extra procs from traits, sigils and runes. This is probably to soft-circumvent the 10 skills limit, tbh. If each skill is the equivalent of 2-5 skills from other MMOs, you effectively end up with 20-50 skills on your hotbar. Of sorts.
---
* Surprisingly limited what it promises. The split with weapons and a spammable main attack skill have not done the game's combat much good comparing GW1, IMO. It ends up feeling far more rote.
---
Now don't get me wrong. GW2's combat is fun, too. But I wouldn't really, after 7 years of GW2, compare it favorably to other MMO's combat systems. They each have their own flaws, FF14 isn't even the slowest one around, it just feels that way by comparison. If anything the biggest flaw in FF14 is that too many jobs have too many skills that have effects too similar to one another.
---
Yeah l. I do remember how disappointed I was 2 months ago, when I got myself a new pc. Tested out wow and was super happy about it. So how this beast can run GW2? This was just sad.
---
I like to think of it as an obscure reference to how they put Azure Striker Gunvolt in Master Blaster
---
he wrote there are good builds and good players - but there arent any magical build who can surive 2vs1 if both side are good ... cause agaisnt bad players you can hold 2 reapers with one scourge. 
---
of course there were broken builds in past, but there arent any such in current game (people being good with class isnt broken build :) ), so just pick one and enjoy yourself -pvp is long run for anything
---
Hey If you decide to assemble a non-cringy/whining/"elite" raiding team to explore the new raid dungeon, without spoilers, just for fun - hit me up!
---
Also If you decide to do Dungeons without "skipping 90% of the content because we are in a hurry for the rewards and do not care about the fun/gameplay of the whole thing" hit me up again!
---
Heh, as someone who started on EQ1 (then went DAoC, WoW, GW2, FF14), it felt briefly weird to me, yeah.
---
Very briefly. In the end, 1.5s GCD is actually slower than many older MMOs had. And don't even get me started on the 6s tick system EQ1 had :D
---
To be fair, SE set the bar incredibly high after the v1.0 fiasco.
---
This is a repost here, too. I know this image and it's totally connected to GW2 in my mind.
---
They would rather release GW3 before this is ever going to happen lol
---
Does anyone know of a eu equivalent? I'm looking to farm every single collection from dungeons but haven't found a guild tondo so and lfg is a tad too slow for me even when I make the groups.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
no- elder dragons were on tyria LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG before Gods come to tyria -they are not native to tyria as world (same as humans for example). This theory only hold if you pick specifics to fit your view..but if you look on everything its fell apart...as it fell apart for last 5 years it running around reddit
---
Haha I feel the opposite. I played gw1 beta and stopped cause.. No jumping gave me headache. Fell in the wow trap for 14yrs.
---
When gw1 came it had farcry ish graphics including water shaders that wow got like ages later.
---
Gw2 pushed the fidelity forward even more.
---
That said wow performance was still pathetic until the patch they added dx12. Now it's improved and I'm using the dx12 wrapper for gw2 myself to make things less horribad. That said on a 2700x with NVMe and 32GB ram and a GTX 1080Ti getting below 30 fps sometimes in LA is sad.. Very sad. Max settings though
---
Plus they made the very first things you see in GW2 **far** less inspiring by removing all non-press-F-to-pay-respects elements :(
---
What does that mean? Is it bad or good with crowded events?
---
Honestly, what is this... Barbie World? Ugh. I used to love playing gw2 for the stunning graphics. But this... so unbelievably ugly and tacky. I want to gouge my eyes out.
---
But I guess, since a 3 year old can play this game... the graphics have to be for that target audience as well.
---
Just gimme Caithe's face and I'll be happy! ;-;
---
Thank you for your service
---
Gw2 remastered = Gw2 with 60 fps
---
&gt;it makes doing anything else with the game open painful
---
Change the priorities of the game and/or the other task.
---
This made me gain 50 fps out of combat and 1 fps in raid combat so I just deleted it. Did I do something wrong?
---
Not much point in going with the 9700K when the 9600K exists, GW2 can't make use of the 2 extra cores.
---
No difference for me in raid combat. i7 4790 and amd r9 390x.
---
Where would they even go from there tho? As far as movement masteries go, I can't imagine anything that could succeed mounts.
---
There are two things that come to my mind:
---
1) the TACO markers show "all" the possible node spots, it doesn't guarantee that they will always be there.
---
2) most nodes (for the skyscale saddle) have a daily account(/character) limit, when you reach it, the nodes stop appearing on the mini map (and can't be interacted with, which can make you think they aren't there).
---
NA or EU? ;)

I have no issue running GW2+Firefox+OBS w/ NVEnc on my 7600K, OBS uses &lt;5% CPU time and Firefox suspends itself almost completely when in the background.
---
i used to use warframe as a "hey, look at what this computer can do!" sales pitch.
---
Are you trolling?
---
Are we factoring in history as well, especially for core specs? Because as a mesmer main I feel the actual design has gone downhill ever since the pre-HoT specialization update. At the same time quite a few other core specs were somewhere between boring (warrior) and atrocious (necro with 25 stack condi cap and only rabid/rampager for gear...) but have improved significantly since then.
---
Similarly with Scrapper they have since rectified their main sin of giving dumb AI minions to a profession which already had that option.
---
**BAD:**
---
* Dragonhunter. Boring, uninspired, few new mechanics. Pretty much a flat dps boost, and burst damage from traps caused issues in PvP as well.
---
* Tempest. The theme and name simply don't fit the spec. Should have been split into an aurashare-type support similar to what we have now and the **proper** Tempest with Overloads, dps Shouts and trait support for Meteor Shower+Frost Storm+Glyph of Storms.
---
* Mirage. Terrible disappointment in PvE for me, arguably a downgrade over other specs outside of dps sandbags. RNG teleports and the axe2 animation lock rob you of control. Bland utility skills and traits (except for IH). Axe3 would bug me under the map or throw me off cliffs, something they fixed on staff+sword ages ago. Also all the PvP agony it has caused due to being massively unfun to play *against*. Staff mirage is a fun casual build though, because it skirts around most of these issues.
---
* Revenant. I hate hate hate *hate* **HATE** the utility skill lock and rigid spec design which basically hard-locks you into 4-5 actual "builds" at most 3 of which *may* be useful depending on context. I still think the 5-point-increment trait system was the best we had, and think it would have been perfect with the stats decoupled.
---
**GOOD:**
---
* Scourge. The idea more than the implementation. A great and unique twist for support necro and a second unique role in PvP hard area denial. Irrelevant utilities, lack of meaningful resource management and many legacy necro issues bring it down though, not to mention that unique PvP role quickly escalates to AoE *destruction* instead.
---
* core mesmer, guardian, to a lesser extent engineer. Always felt the most "complete" in terms of options and variety, even when most of it was completely useless due to numbers balance you could usually state a single numbers-only change to make things interesting (PvE mesmer would have been *sooo* much better if they had simply doubled the damage on autos, guardian had all the makings of an expansion-style healer except the numbers were about 10x too low)
---
* Holosmith. Cool visuals, fun elite which has an interesting interaction with the "unofficial" profession mechanic, feels "elite" more than "core2.0" (looking at you chrono!)
---
* Firebrand. Axe is a bit boring but the moment-to-moment variety offered by mantras and tomes is cool. Fun combos and support options to complement core guard.
---
At this point I'd consider all elite specs "decent" though. Dragonhunter still is bland, druid is useless in general PvE, thief has no support/healing options (except Detonate Plasma against certain raid bosses) and mirage axe can go die in a ditch. I hope they don't ruin firebrand or chrono with their desire for "downsides" in the future.
---
only worth if you park a char on some permanent node with good upgrades, mostly Rich Gold Vein and some spots with multible foraging nodes
---
Yea, those players quitting so early don't live up to my expectations really ;)
---
jack of blades
---
As for flopping, I beg to disagree... it had minor hiccups, compare it to other MMO launches that are just catastrophic failures and long queues, down times, crashes, etc.
---
Very good read, but I have a very important question for you: was the skyscale mining tool itself adorable or no?
---
Old discussion that, we did get Guild Wars 2 - Anet weren't obliged to just re-make GW1 and all its features in new wrapping - and I'm glad those who felt so scorned and are still upset are back in their own little sub over at /r/guildwars where their hate against this great game can be ignored ;)
---
&gt;The Pale Tree, like Glint, is a child of an Elder Dragon, freed from that dragon's influence.  Specifically, it's implied that she's a purified/freed version of a Blighting Tree. 
---
A dragon champion, or dragon minion, is not the same thing as a scion of an Elder Dragon.
---
Glint was a biological child of Kralkatorrik, who was born with free will, and later corrupted by Kralk before eventually being freed by the Forgotten.
---
The Pale Tree, as you said, is just a purified Blighting Tree - Mordremoth's physical body was that of a serpentine dragon (called linnorms in most fantasies) similar to the Mystical Dragon miniature. So by appearances, the Pale Tree (or Malyck's Tree) are **not** scions of Mordremoth. The Blighting Trees seem to be corrupted [Stonewood](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Stonewood) trees, which are known to be the largest tree species in the Maguuma, as [The Great Tree](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Great_Tree) and [Ancient Tree](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ancient_Tree), which are both gargantuan and, along with the Heart of Thorns tree which shares appearances, are the largest trees in the Maguuma besides the Blighting Trees.
---
Sylvari are not like Aurene either, but rather they're closer to the facets that Glint created.
---
The only dragon minions ever even suggest to being capable of replacing Elder Dragons are Glint and her children, and Tequatl. While it's certainly possible that others could be capable, there's nothing to suggest it. In fact, even The Shatterer is marked as not being a scion, and only scions seem capable of replacing Elder Dragons. Tequatl's state as being scion or not is unclear, as is whether or not it could have replaced Zhaitan if given time, but it is established that Tequatl was taking in Zhaitan's released magic and becoming more powerful and intelligent before his ultimate canonical death in late 1326 AE.
---
&gt; TBH, I was already thinking that Season 5 will be less about fighting a war, and more about cleanup and recovery efforts. 
---
Maybe an episode or two, but a full season on that will be fairly boring. I'm expecting a multi-plot season, much like Season 3, and one of the plots will be finding replacements for Zhaitan and Mordremoth. I doubt we'll cover much about "cleanup" because we never go back to old zones anymore.
---
This isn't the fault of Taco, it's just an overlay, it doesn't modify the game in any way. 
---
There are two possible things that are causing this:
---
* Taco shows potential spawn points for nodes, and the nodes only have a chance to show up at each potential spawn point, there won't be real nodes at every possible spawn point that Taco shows you
---
* you've hit the daily cap for that node type, and the nodes are being hidden by the game as you cannot obtain any more of that resource today
---
My personal tldr view of the above then is not worth it unless you are into micromanagement annoyance for minimal gains.
---
Thanks for the research
---
Is lastfm still  a thing? :O
---
I used it for a month, had a bunch of issues
---
As someone who plays both I can understand the original players who cling onto the nostalgia, they’re completely different games in combat and style. They’ve made GW2 more playable by the masses, far easier to monetise and a fantastic game overall but there is still a little part of me that still misses the original dearly.
---
whether or not it was a red hearing is irrelevant, it was still setup for season 3.
---
Please dont give me hope seeing Kuunavaang in gw2
---
Maybe. But the event lasts two weeks. Kinda lame to make the drop rates so abysmal on a limited time event. Especially with the mystic forge stones, new skins, and infusions with that.
---
that was my suspicion but i'd like confirmation
---
He’s rich, ya know.
---
I love your idea, but idk if capcom gonna like that *wink ;)
---
So you are saying it supplies &lt;80 level green gear? Because if not your point is quite moot. It would still be current level gear even if quite useless.
---
When was that? it's been getting more and more stable over time
---
The corsair h115i. Runs quiet and im hovering around 60-65C when stress testing. Get good ram with it though
---
I removed it sometime around ep6 release
---
I guess from now on i will safe all my bags of gear until the cost of low level mats fly to the sky
---
PvP/WvW?
---
Musical instruments?
---
I mean thats a downgrade as it is even more tab target lol.
---
Print Screen it
---
PvP/WvW.
---
It's slow on your first job, but alts cam be levelled really quickly in POTD
---
&gt; raids are a freaking square or circle with some ground texture usually...
---
Have you seen the Coils or Alexander raids? Because what Stormblood did isn’t even close to the old raids in feel and scale.
---
Yeaaah, nooo one

Change the process [affinity](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.windowscentral.com/assign-specific-processor-cores-apps-windows-10%3famp) for GW2. Works for Win 7 and even XP.
---
I've done few trainings too. And you know what ? I'm happy to say I had the same idea. But, during some panic moments, this is clearly not a solution. At least it's a way to make just like there was no "target problem". But a fix could be more than welcome. Let's wait and be patient as usual.
---
WoW was born under the premise that it was to be accessible to the widest public possible, so they always strived for optimization when they could afford it.
---
Well, both HoT and PoF are strictly lvl 80 only.
---
So your best bet is to get that lvl first. Even though you can get lvl80 boost with bought expansion, I would say not to use it now, as getting lvls and such will give you some training about how the game works again. HoT has many dangers that can easily kill unprepared player, so some practice before entering it is very good idea, after all. PoF has a bit easier open world, but still it is quite above core game in difficulty.
---
I hope you did not deleted old characters, as those birthday gifts are absolutely unique rewards with no other way of getting :P
---
So in other words, the raids first did the important stuff of LS3 regarding the White Mantle (as you attest to)?
---
It is good for the playerbase that certain aspects of the raids get rehashed and reiterated in LS3, but I think what concerns people is that that shouldn't have happened in the first place if Anet were standing by their commitment to not have important story information in raids. It is worth remembering that all of wing 1 - 3 were released before Out of the Shadows and the latter absolutely built on plot that was only available in raids.
---
Or just get rid of links entirely.
---
I mean, why wait though? The boss is super killable working around the ground-target bug, and the rest of the fight is super unique and interesting (especially on CM). If you're not running heal Renegade, you can usually cobble together enough projectile hate for hands on your DPS: thieves can take smokescreen, mesmers Feedback, druid has staff 5 baked into the usual kit, Guardians get Shield of the Avenger which is INCREDIBLE, if you're using a carry healer, Scourge gets Corrosive Poison Cloud and Tempest gets "Aftershock!" and Sand Squall (which have the benefit of no ground target)... You can even just time aegis share with guardians or chronomancers.
---
Actually it was... Practically since release in raids 15-40 fps they just improved now with dx12 by a huge margin fps wise. Also plenty of areas in wow were fps killer specially mid range rigs. 
---
As you can see in gw2 a hobby developer does a dx12 converter and gets already nice gains...
---
If only arenanet would start to work on optimization...
---
Well the materials of level 40 and 50 bags are holding on to their prices atm because of these strategies putting more of them in the market. If all bags become soulbound for example, and therefore can only give the loot of the char that got the bag in the first place, mithril and orichalchum/silk and gossamer will become even more worthless than they already are, and the t3-4 mats will all skyrocket. That doesn't sound like a fix to me.
---
u/Title2ImageBot
---
Reaper is a really consistent dps class with lots of utility. You can get some good results on any power favoured boss and it's easily good enough to play it in casual raid clears.  
---
I can send you some logs if you want.
---
I don't hear it often. But, sometimes i do, you guys who like really tough challenges are weird (in a good way?)
---
Like, it has to be really tough, you need days / weeks of preparation and learning through trial and error to really feel like you have accomplished something. It bugs me out.
---
Ay mate. Great tool! Works great for me. Only thing I noticed is that it puts the d3d9.dll in the bin64 folder, which makes it so Arc doesnt load at all for me. I have to then manually pull the d3d9.dll next to the gw2 exe.
---
Do you know why this happens? Is this intended? I guess I could update the toCheckPath inside the "$toCheck -eq 'd3d9'" if-clause to change this?
---
While agreed that is an annoying glitch I will note.
---
On asura.
---
The plural of Asura is asura.
---
 Asuran is an adjective describing Asura tech.
---
Asuran golem, asuran laser, asuran design.
---
And there is never an s to give them plural. 
---
Saje eith any other race other than humans.
---
People have tried connecting gods and dragons since almost the year of release and the devs have said over and over they are not related. Dragons were already there before the gods arrived
---
Please delete this, I'm enjoying selling them for ~2.5G apiece to people who don't know any better.
---
It's nice but it's not super good for raids at all imo. For open world and more casual play it's fun I guess but the different stat sets are a bit annoying to handle when they really don't add all that much, stat choice could be just from traits or only weapons or something.
---
The login screen does that to all female Asura eyes, haven't seen it actually ingame though.
---
In any of the 2 PvP modes professions feel like they function way different than in other MMO's because you can often do whatever you want with them and create castly different playstyles.
---
Yeah, this. Whilst it was completely legit, I always thought the whole 'transfer and open certain loot on a lower level character' was a janky as hell system to have in place.
---
Not everyone can afford computers every 5 years y’know
---
as a ffxiv player, nice joke.
---
I mean, have you been using the same character name and appearance for every MMO?
---
Just awesome !
---
(pulling this one straight out of my ass but i'm hyping myself up) how about they create some sort of wind dolyak or camel thing that lets u mount up solo dolo first and then a maxed out mastery version of it lets u carry one other player (**plEASE**) 
---
we could go on cute gathering hunts with our buddies (ง⌐□ل͜□)ง, explore the beautiful vast maps together, the engage skill could be a non-damaging charge that grants superspeed to you and allies &amp; the animation is just it running off disintegrating into a gust of wind (to carry on from the skyscale engage fly-away animation)
---
Sure, I meant that they don't want to do it right now, famous "everything is on the table" still applies.
---
Now that you mention it, yeah. Sort of 🤣
---
It can and it does. Maybe no 100% usage but thats okay, i dont want to buy a new cpu which instantly bottlenecks
---
And? Who said they were the first Champions? Could have been other Champions before, and the Gods were just the latest set of Champions.
---
As a beginner chrono you should completely ignore your damage and focus on your boon uptime.
---
Thanks. Today I’ve been keeping an eye on quick/Alan up time and found them mostly stacked up for a quite long time, so feels alright.
---
Ouch.
---
our very first static cm kill, enjoy :)
---
mainly uploaded it to maybe start a discussion about what classes to use/strats etc, hopefully will find sth clean &gt;&lt;
---
I played my ranger non-stop until HoT came out, at which point my Engineer became my main. Melee with an engineer?? Finally! Not to mention it was far too appropriate to flamethrower all the ~~sylvari~~ mordrem enemies I could see.
---
I really wanted to get into deadeye for PoF, but Holosmith was just so nice to play. I got into deadeye eventually but i'm just hoping whatever specs come out for the next expansion don't keep me on the same two characters.
---
It's not even bags of gear, utility backpacks area also gone. So no more mat drops from bags, no more rando exotics from bags. Here enjoy few pieces of blue unid gear, and 2 rares.
---
Depends on you. Most or rather nearly all content is for level 80 but if you for example want to play PvP now and want to have access to the elite specs then you need the expansions now. If you want to level a revenant then you want to have the expacs now. The restrictions otherwise are pretty minor, only the limitations on the trading post and lack of bag slots have annoyed me when i am on any of my f2p account.
---
No, i mean OP makes it sound like TacO is *sending* data to the game causing its internal rendering to change:
---
&gt; They aren't shown on the mini-map, and don't spawn in-game at all. If I close "taco" and reload gw2, I respawn at the waypoint, and the nodes appear again
---
If it's just the TacO markers that's a no-brainer and if this happens **without** TacO OP is just hitting an in-game cap. Restarting *the game* might land OP on a different map IP which if not tested separately could also shift undue blame on TacO.
---
Assuming OP did not make any such simple mistakes (which admittedly is a major assumption), explain to me how the mumble API would enable a third-party program to *disable rendering or interaction within the game itself.*
---
Dx912pxy does wonders imo
---
I do backpack, 1 accessory, and two rings from bitterfrost (by attuning one) unless I need to infuse, since I so rarely have enough mats to infuse I only do that to bloodstone fen rings so they can be stat reset.
---
I usually get my other accessory from ember bay, might switch this up for Dragonfall as mistborn motes are easier to come by, imo.
---
Amulet I tend to get from draconis mons and sometimes sirens landing, maybe a 80/20 split (on rare occasion from Lake Doric if my jade is up). Again I might move this to Dragonfall but I don't know what that maps daily farming limits are yet.
---
Not all bosses are toughness based. 
---
Toughness based are: VG, gorseval, KC, Xera, Deimos, Dhuum, Largos, w7b1+2
---
And what exactly are you trying to accomplish with "Thanks Anet"?
---
I like the notification thing on the right hand side! its really fluid and dynamic looking! Great job!
---
What i'm saying, that if they removed Bags Of Gear, because 
---
&gt; Raids are max level content, why should it supply rewards for things that are not?
---
Then why in the hell there is green gear as reward in raids?
---
It seems like the pre-PoF champion bags still drop level-appropriate loot if opened on a lower level character. Do you have any example of champion bags that got changed to drop unidentified gear on lower levels?
---
If you check the official forums for WvW you will are that the devs are preparing a new way for worlds to combine for WvW matches, that seems on paper at least to improve matchmaking a ton.
---
Bottom line is that choosing a world/server might be irrelevant for WvW in the future.
---
Hi on any of my f2p account., I'm dad.
---
did you even play the first raid?
---
Hey, Made in Abyss soundtrack .. cool stuff ;)
---
Maybe just HoT? I've killed adina like six times and only got unids
---
Pony hands down or rainbow unicorn
---
You will be over 200 in no time ;)
---
If you cleared w1, I would recomend w4 next, its even easier except the last boss (and even that one can be considered easier if you do the ranged strat)
---
Not risky at all. Deadeye has a shit ton of sustain with invigorating precision, more range with shadow step and more damage than scourge. Deadeye has no cc capabilities at all though which is why in my opinion its terrible in pugs. Scourge can solo break a pylon, good sustain and boon rip. It does however have low damage and lower range. Its just a trade off between utility and dps
---
I disagree, I liked a lot the meta rush reward boxes
---
they can't simply make a "group finder" for raids, since the meta shifts and in general you can't say we need now 1 tank, 2 healers rest dps.  
---
some bosses require no tank, some don't, then there are different setups. for example if you go by alacrity, you need either 2 chronos or 1 alacrigate...for quickness a single boon thief can be enough. but on other encounters it doesn't work at all.  
---
there is so much diversity in terms of how to set up a raidgroup in gw2, a simply group finder can't really work since you cannot break down roles to tank, boon support heal or whatever...there is too much in between, some groups want only 1 heal, some want 2.  
---
thats why we have to life with the lfg as it is.  
---
blaming selling groups which have their ad up 24/7 on some afk won't do anything in this regard.  
---
go back in at 19 - 20 pm and you will probably find, depending on the time and day, 20+ lfgs searching for kills.
---
Also keep in mind that fractal community is much larger than the raid community. Like 2% of all players are regular raiders while a huge percentage of players who do not even consider raiding to fractals every day. Also, raids are bound to weekly rewards and therefore only hardcore players raid multiple times a week. But that is totally in every MMO with raids.
---
Was the same with dungeons and fractals in the beginning, it just shifted there because dungeons have been abandoned...
---
Everything else aside a single static screenshot is absolutely meaningless in this context. A perfectly viable explanation for low LFG listings in other contexts is that groups fill much *faster* thus resulting in a lower open population. Imagine if all those "map full" entries for metas were culled automatically (raid and fractal groups *are* because map full=squad/group full!) - you'd think all of them were completely dead content when arriving 2min before spawn.
---
Also don't forget to divide the fractal listings by 2 because at equal populations you'd have half as many full raid squads.
---
&gt; That is just the same as a continuation, which is exactly what happens with the early raids and LS3.
---
No. It's called a reboot, not continuation.
---
&gt; Furthermore, you do need to read up on the raid story to understand the books in Bloodstone Fen - both reference activities of Xera and Matthias if I recall though it has been years since I did the achievement so may be misremembering. 
---
Not really. Xera and Matthias are barely mentioned in those books, and all you need to know is provided in said books - that they're high ranked WM who are performing experiments with bloodstones for an "Operation Rebirth" which is to bring back Lazarus.
---
Hell, the books explained more about the raids than the raids themselves did. The raids never mention why Matthias was where he was, just that he was sacrificing people with bloodstone. The books are what explains that he was experimenting with embedding bloodstone into people which often resulted in their deaths.
---
&gt;  We have the issue of ritual sacrifices being conducted for some unknown purpose (Gorseval) which explains the context for where the ghosts come from in Bloodstone Fen.
---
The two are only marginally connected, and Gorseval irrelevant to Bloodstone Fen. Gorseval was born from corpses after the souls were let loose from the pulse of magic from Mordremoth's deaht, not some intended result. Bloodstone Fen explains where those souls came from, but Gorseval holds no relevance to the plot of S3 or Bloodstone Fen.
---
&gt; We have an expansion on what becomes the unbound magic storyline through Vale Guardian (the Unbound Guardian in Bloodstone Fen is highly implied to be VG after destruction of the containment pillars).
---
Did you even raid? The Vale Guardian - and Unbound Guardian - are constructs made from mursaat magic, unrelated to the unbound magic. The Unbound Guardian is in no way implied to be the Vale Guardian, just that they're of the similar origins (mursaat defense magic).
---
&gt; We have the confirmation of bandits working with the White Mantle, something that was only hinted at before, through Sabetha and Trio.
---
Hinted at? Right:
---
[Apparently, the White Mantle is hiding behind bandit activities.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rending_the_Mantle)
---
Try explicitly stated with a smack to the face for emphasis. And that's just one of multiple statements and showcases of the relation.
---
&gt; We have the Bloodstone experiments and their effects on people (turning into abominations) in Matthias which directly relates to the final fight of LS3 episode 4.
---
I'll give you that, though it's barely covered in the raid. You got mining bloodstone and using the bloodstone for the ritual of reviving Lazarus and you have Matthias' bloodstone abomination form, but that was it in the raids. The entire mention of experiments comes from Bloodstone Fen, **NOT** the raids.
---
&gt; Bloodstone weaponry that is also used in episode 4 is introduced in raids.
---
I'll give you that as well, not that it was at all relevant to the S3 plot. And, again, thoroughly covered in Bloodstone Fen.
---
&gt; There are also further aspects of Bloodstone corruption and the exploiting of ley energy.
---
Which as? As far as I'm aware, the answer is "there wasn't." So please provide more explicit details.
---
&gt; And there is everything with Xera and Lazarus too.
---
Xera is 110% irrelevant to Season 3. If not for the books in Bloodstone Fen, there's be no hide nor hair of her mentioned in the entirety of the game outside the raid. As for Lazarus, again, all involvement beyond namedroping is nothing more than a red herring that amounts to jack shit.
---
If you did or read up on the raid, then you'd have an upper hand knowledge of less than 5 minutes of suspecting him instead of Caudecus as being the one who absorbed the Bloodstone before "Lazarus" revealed himself at the end.
---
Oh, wow, such major importance! SUCH TRAVESTY IT'S ONLY IN THE RAID! Not.
---
Knowing about Lazarus from the raid holds zero relevance or importance beyond those five minutes of "who in the world ate the bloodstone's explosion".
---
Complaining about "lore in the raid that is important to the story" here is about the same as complaining that you have to go find scavenger hunt objects to get the lore of the White Mantle in Bloodstone Fen. Actually, it's far more insignificant because the lore in the raids is either thrown in our face in the main plot, or is at best tersely related to the main plot.
---
**Your skill in Skinning has increased to 400**
---
True, but I haven't had the motivation to grind it while doing WvW to final tier. :)  Bit resigned about Walls Get In The Way. :P
---
When I read the description I thought this thing gave refined materials. So when harvesting an ore node you'd get ingots and planks instead of ore and logs...and I think I like my version much better than this one.
---
Thanks for your research. I have even less inclination to buy this now.
---
Of course new masteries aren't neccesarily about movement. See: All core tyria masteries and many HoT masteries outside of Gliding. And new masteries are certainly not about succeeding existing masteries.
---
Add to that, that most ppl clear all in first day/two days of the week, then do other stuff. This week might be special cause some ppl are still doing a w7 progression or achievements.
---
1080ti and getting 30fps in cities lol
---
&gt; The class and macro system was amazing
---
It really was. Then they released pay2win classes for 100s of $.
---
And in terms of mechanics this would do what exactly?
---
Yeah I heard about that! Will try if I met any good chance ‘
---
DF isn't more lucrative than SW. Both are about 20g/h (the NA farm community made a really nice document about it)
---
Thanks.
---
Adina is one of the most fun and unique bosses in the game, once they iron out the issues with ground target it might be one of my favorites.
---
I haven't done PvP in GW2 so I wouldn't know about it. As such, would be silly of me to comment comparing them, right? But, because I'm not a PvP player, I didn't think of mentioning it in the first place.
---
1.65/1.95 right now. RIP.
---
What's a horse?
---
Oooh, you mean a centaur, right?
---
Id like the idea of a horse as a baseline mount somewhere between jackal and raptor for people without PoF 
---
Just to keep up for future expansions
---
^(Like a gateway drug to the joy of movement)
---
Dunno then. Maybe they were all just from events (pre-gorse, pre-matt, TC).
---
Half a centaur, with the top half of that one costume those circus folk from ember bay wear.
---
Absolutely agree. This game is starting to become Mount Wars 2. It would be nice if there was some other mechanic we could get excited about and discuss.  I love the mounts but with the exception of underwater ones, its run its course.
---
That makes sense, a traditionally easier to play core class, already pretty popular, and meta to boot.
---
I may just go with Mesmer!
---
Could be an uncommon drop as well, instead of the raw unids. Needs some research!
---
FFXIV's combat and PvP is pure trashtier compared to Gw2, thats all.
---
yay～～！
---
you dont tick down from the pylon that fast, you tick down from the condis fast. Rifle deadeye can use hide in shadows if its really necessary to remove the condi's and heal up.
---
You mean I get to listen to your voice again??
---
I am getting a lil annoyed when I see "Sylvaris"
---
I don't see most of core openworld locations [s]often[/s], should we untexture them? 
---
And if you mean that this is only visible in extreme cases, then a) floating throne is supposed to float, b) cloth doesn't go all the way to the ground and even on 100% flat surfaces can still see the inner part. At least you would be able to see it, if it was there  at all. 
---

---
Yes, the design is good because you can create a squad and advertise it.
---
You dont even have to look at people for friendly abilities. In XIV you can be facing the opposite direction (auto face target off, especially useful for petrifaction in T7, and I've never gone back). If you need to for any reason, there is a "face target" button.

"Glint was a biological child of Kralkatorrik, who was born with free will, and later corrupted by Kralk"

Source that this is exactly the case please?
---
Yeah, I was going to add that but didn’t feel like getting into a argument about LFR, tbf. I probably would’ve quit WoW ages ago if not for LFR and the dungeon finger cause it’s allowed me to play despite most of my family and old guild quitting.
---
Thanks for the answers.
---
Why do you take Weighty Terms instead of Stalwart Speed in the Firebrand tree? Is it because the extra Boon Duration you get from Harrier's gear lets you drop some quickness sources? I'm assuming Weighty Terms is taken more for the mantra recharge and not the immobilize. Is this so the Firebrand can apply more quickness/Aegis from their Mantras?
---
Also I'm guessing that open spot in slot skills in the builds you linked are for a varying utility skill. If I'm running Axe/Shield &amp; Staff, my only sources of Regen for the group would be in Tome of Resolve, Mantra of Lore, and "Hold the Line!". Should I default to Mantra of Lore in that extra spot in order to cover Regen?
---
Is there any way I can practice applying Aegis to block a big hit in Fractals without having to be in the Fractal itself? Like can any golem in Fractal or Aerodrome do some mechanics so I can practice applying Aegis? On a related note, are there certain attacks that are unblockable (aka Aegis won't work on them)? If there's somewhere I can read up on these that'd be great.
---
I am concerned about overcapping concentration. Since potions will give 15%+ depending on my AR, I was considering using Healing infusions and maybe swapping a few Harrier's for Magi's to keep my Boon Duration at a number that would be roughly 100% when potions are accounted for, but wasn't sure if this would be efficient.
---
Regarding LS3 Currencies, I remember reading somewhere that all nodes (except for berries) reset on the daily reset, but I don't think I was able to confirm this. Would you happen to know if the node cap resets on daily reset or on their own 24hr timer?
---
Literally any CPU or GPU post 2017 is powerful to curvestomp most GW2 asks for performance wise.
---
The problem isn't the hardware. It's GW2.
---
But yes get Gen 3 Ryzen if you are upgrading. Unless you're looking to get the maximum of the maximum out of the newest AAA games at release on 4k at 144 hrz, there is not a single reason to get a Intel CPU.
---
&gt; When you say “missing textures” I’m assuming you mean something immediately visible, which would be an actual problem.
---
Yeah, that's the thing that jumps out at me - I can't even begin to tell what the OP is even complaining about.
---
I feel like you undervalued some mounts. On the surface that's what you see but different maps let different mounts shine
---
When i got a pc with a 7700k and 1070ti last year i thought i could run gw2 at high settings with stable 60fps
---
Boy was I wrong..
---
If there were ever a GW3, it'd still be using the same old engine to save costs.
---
I would argue that there is something wrong with being poor because your life would probably be pretty bad, but then again I wouldn't know.
---
I'm not so much being an ass, and mostly just feel bad for people who waste their money. But hey if it allows people like me to save money then I guess I don't feel so bad because at least I'm getting something good out of it
---
What union is your computer part of, asking for a friend
---
I mean, you go mental then I guess. xd If you weren't forced into "playing" this "real life" sure, I think everyone would choose an alternative reality where there are no diseases and death. To the trash greedy pay 2 win games you are able to and should say goodbye tho. :]
---
My gem exchange tab is broken , but the tp and gem store both work. I thought it wouldn't hurt to post asking for help since support is running so behind right now. I also posted on the forums. I didn't get a solution there either , but at least I got a couple replies that were civil , and were attempts to help.
---
And then you fight mobs that can be killed by your cat jumping on your keyboard for 75% of the game's content.
---
Oh wow thanks for the info!
---
Nice kill
---
Did you use the Rifle Deadeye build from SnowCrows and used IP for the healing or did you changed something else?

After all this time, the Mists will get the love and attention it deserves!

what are you on about? it was a simple question.

*wakes up and looks at message count*
---
I’m going to hitch a ride on the top comment as this may not get seen otherwise.  Yes, I saw it on /r/ProgrammerHumor and it immediately resonated with me as a player since beta.  It’s just a silly meme and not posted with any sort of malice in mind. One of those moments where if an ANet dev is reading I am laughing/crying with you, not at you.
---
I love the game and like everyone else who loves the game have struggled with and made it a key determining factor in building a gaming rig; before even worrying about how well modern games might play on it.
---
What I do find heartening is the excellent feedback people are getting here with suggestions on system builds and plugins.  dx912pxy and gw2hook really are miracle workers to the extent of what they are capable of doing within limitations of being a GW2 “plug-in”. The former still in beta and has a really active dev who seems to care about making the game better so we all can enjoy it more.  If you haven’t tried it already, I would encourage you to give it a shot. It’s gotten quite stable in the last few releases.
---
Anywho, as a mostly lurker on Reddit, this post is now my highest upvoted (number 2 being a Mad King Pumpkin) and honestly, I think I’m okay with that. 😅

Actually, in names of locations, in dialogue and in lore there are several mentions of horses. In addition in GW1 there were skeletal horses and in GW2 there are toy horses. This all suggests that horses have existed and probably still exist, they just aren't shown for some reason.
---
Purely as a skin they would be fine I guess but as an entirely new thing I don't see the appeal.
---
If only I could run a static with my company !
---
The gold weapons have a sparkly effect instead of the mist, and they look good with an Egyptian/Awakened or Zodiac style,
---
1. I wasn't screaming, just had my caps key on and didn't realise.
---
2. Are all the DLC fully necessary?
---
3. To play the last DLC do I have to buy the first ones?
---
I honestly can't play without hook anymore. Been like that for years, since the old times of sweetfx.
---
But i heard you can now use both dx12 and hook, so maybe take a look on that.
---
There are only two expansions (the game doesn't ever call them "DLC" because they are much bigger than that). How "fully necessary" they are depends on what you plan on doing with the game. You don't have to buy the previous expansion to play the current one, but you probably want to, since the storylines are connected and go in chronological order.
---
Sole reason, aside performance on the reset, why I do use standard models in WvW. Tag just always above players.
---
The imperfect system is having endgame content being less worth than mid game-content. Atm all T5 mats are on a all time low. Sometimes you can't even sell green unind gear on the TP.
---
Oh, ok. Thank you very much.
---
I think you've nailed exactly what I'm feeling. It's a nostalgia thing to a certain extent. I'll never be able to capture that and the real life money I'll have to spend to get everything again isn't worth it. (It's like all these people who think they want vanilla servers--they really don't.)
---
I made a new character and I'm taking my time, actually reading what the NPCs say and not skipping through all the story script. It's scratching the itch for now.
---
[I experienced a similar thing with a shield](https://imgur.com/a/ZviRCSW)
---
&gt; It's all a matter of optimization.  
---
I call bullshit. Have you ever studied comp. sci. or software engineering? Ever written (coded) any software? Because it doesn't sound like it.  
---
&gt; Saying that multithreading would not help that much is quite silly when there are multiple games on the market that suggest otherwise.  
---
This is a dumb statement that I don't have the time or energy to spend refuting atm.  
---
I'm not entirely sure you understand what *multi-threading* is to be honest.    
---
Most likely GW2 does use multithreading already, since it's quite possible to do on a single core cpu.  
---
All that means is that cpu shares processing time across multiple processes. That is it runs one process at a time and suspends the others meanwhile, but it switches the active one out so they can each execute for a little while.   
---
Using multiple core or even true parallelism is a different kettle of fish and poses problems any time a process running on core needs to "talk" to one running on a different core.
---
I looked quickly into it, there are some mistakes as mentioned earlier on this post. It may be interesting to add the platform during P2 and P3 and P4 to work on the vicious position of pillars on these parts.
---
How does less interactive and skillbased combat make it great lol, the combat is real shit when i compare it to other games i play like Gw2 and Smite.
---
I don't like raiding all that much and I can't find enjoyment in FFXIV from casual play because everything is so easy that executing a rotation, CC, buffs, etc... perfectly has the same outcome as my cat jumping on my keyboard.
---
Why wait for what ? I didn't wait to kill. I'm just saying this bug is super annoying, maybe more than the damages which were fixed. (-:
---
But I know it's easier to fix an amount of damages than (re)build an arena. 
---
Anyway, thanks for the advices you added. I'll share them. ;-)
---
Maybe you should've lead with that in the OP instead of being an antagonistic prick about it. Now that you mention it, yes, I get what you're getting at, but just assuming that everyone can immediately see what you're complaining about without any "hey, here's the problem" is silly.
---
I built mine with an R5 2600 and it runs great. If you want more specs let me know.
---
Dunno i mostly WvW roam and never have this problem except vs mesmer.
---
Also gearing is easy i just craft exotic armor and most of the time i already have the trinkets.
---
Quaggans.
---
Sorry to rain on your parade but harvesting leather from wild animals happens in more or less 99% of all RPGs.
---
No I have never got to experience WoW. I know they have improved the game engine throughout the years.
---
Sorry, sometimes I forget how many special people do we have here and overestimate those I adress to.
---
It also hard exposes people...actually a lot of mechanics in W7 hard exposes people. I love it.
---
Anet also pays below-average wages for their developers considering their location (Seattle).
---
Haha now i know. Only if we could give them nicknames :D
---
Ok, you got me, on all 'playable ' races other than humans. There is no plural with an s.
---
Being able to select allies to use abilities on them.
---
Isn't this exactly how GW2 is though? It's all just hack and slash outside of raiding, it literally doesn't matter what you do due to the sheer amount of players doing it at once. Most content can be completed by 1 smashing too.
---
At least 4 player dungeons are significantly affected by how you play, a good player in any role speeds it up significantly. Also it sounds to me like you haven't really gone too far in the content as yeah, the early content is easy but there are mechanics later on in the game even in casual play that require your attention, especially if you're a more casual player.
---
You're hilarious
---
But hey, all weapons that was released after PoF requires Gift of Desert Master OR Gift of Maguuma, so it's does make sense
---
&gt; Is this true?
---
Yes and no. Your level gets adjusted depending on which zone you are in. If you are level 50 and you are in a level 10 zone, your effective level will be 10 as well but your actual level will stay at 50 and you will get loot and EXP according to your actual level. Which means, your attributes get adjusted and you feel weaker but in relation there are not that different than on higher level. Which also means, you will still be challenged and will not steamroll the lower level zones just because you are at a higher level. However, it still gets easier because you know the game better and are more likely to recognize or evade attacks or even use skill combos to kill enemies faster or miss attacks.
---
&gt; if I were to buy the game, should I buy the DLC? which DLC are the best?
---
Those are Expansions, They expand the game. DLC sounds like some additional character or a new map or something.
---
You can try the game with a free account which I would recommend, you will be under restrictions to prevent bots and gold sellers from spamming the game into oblivion. If you like the game you can buy either expansion to lift those restrictions and be able to access the expansion content as well. Both expansions are only relevant when you are the max level (80) so you can just try the game with a free account first.
---
In terms of what is "best", there is not really anyone who can answer this for you. Heart of thorns has many great looking maps with meta events and gliding mastery but a lacking story, Path of fire has a great story but lacks in the meta events of maps, it also has mounts. IMO both expansions are great in their own way and if you get invested into the game you should definitely get both. But you have to decide that for yourself.
---
It does that on my human male as well
---
Checked that shield in the wardrobe, the problem is still there. RIP.
---
Don't delete it. It's informative for others who may consider doing what you did.
---
PotD is boring, and I personally do not think that its something players should be pushing.  It puts the grind to the grinder, and you really aren't learning the classes/roles you choose to bring into it.
---
It does not. Unfortunately.
---
Well yes but gw2 isn't really different in that regard.
---
Also people actually start to use them up when they add new styles.
---
Go a long time without new styles and the stockpile grows even faster.
---
SW farm still give Champ Bags and Bags of Gear you can open on low level toons.  So they should fix that too.
---
Problem is, if they "fix" all this then the prices of T3 and T4 mats are going to skyrocket in price as the only way to get it is farming low level areas with low level characters.  They really need an economist at Anet.
---
&gt;Properly taking advantage of multiple cores takes effort.
---
So we agree then?
---
Got away with Murder by selling them 6gold a piece the first night.
---
ayayayay
---
You do need a Total Makeover Kit, but only one. You can try it out at a makeover preview NPC, even! The whole process is essentially switch to male, pick a certain horn style, and then switch to female.  
---
(note that you can only get the fancy horns for female charr!)
---
even if he logs off. you still have his name. just shoot him an ingame message. most people are actually super happy when you do that.
---
Good call on the shoulders. I was thinking they were one of the Norn racial skins but the character didn't look like a Norn model so I didn't mention it.
---
skycale can be the same or better than springer for obstacles. The only thing that varies is the way you bypass the obstacle. With springer you get right in front of the obstable and jump. With skyscale you start bypasing the obstacle before you reach it and use the dash option to avoid losing altitude.
---
Of course on dragonfall bettle is perfect for bridge events. Since you have to repeat them quite a bunch of times you can easily learn the path quickly and get credit for all the bridges at the start of the meta. 
---
And of course jackal portals can save you a lot of time.... if you know or remember which ones are the ones you need. Typically the good one is the one that shortens the trip from ogre to hydra at the start of the leyline infused bosses.
---
As attractive as as elite specs are think that they mean more work at anet to keep them balanced.
---
In any case i would easily sign for an expansion followed by a LS of 6 episodes (3 months between each one). They can give a little longer delay between the release of the expansion and the first episode of the new LS and we are talking about almost 2 years between expansions.
---
For example, i would now prefer a full new expansion pack in 3 months time instead of a new LS. And if was able to choose i would prefer the HoT style over the PoF style. 
---
But please, i just implore one thing, no more renown hearts for gods sake. Dragonfall will probably be the best LS4 map just because of this and because the metaevent style resembles those of HoT.
---
As for other gamemodes, a new raid every 6 months doesn't sound like a bad deal, similar for fractals, and even though i'm not much into pvp please keep those players entertained in both PvP/WvW. They are part of the game too.
---
Don't be catty
---
PSA: Do a quick google search for “unpark cpu cores”. This will allow your cpu’s other cores to effectively share the load and will make a huge difference in your GW2 performance.
---
*feints*
---
That is a shame and the bugs and difficulty made a lot quit sadly. Still best raid ever minus the bugs in my opinion. maybe i have rose tinted glasses though, but I loved it
---
I donno, they could always just package the remaster with an expansion. Wouldn't be the first mmo to do that.
---
I do agree that a GW3 seems more likely. I also just have massive sunk cost fallacy with all the stuff I've unlocked in GW2 AND don't think I could invest that deep into a new title like a potential GW3
---
IIRC some of the golden weapons were lacking trail effects despite the regular counterpart having them, other than that it's up to personal preference and most of them look like deformed rocks rather than actual weapons either way.
---
I’m pretty sure you would. Just like we all moved on from GW1 .
---
But that isn't better combat, it is just straight up eassier. Look at any action combat game, you say it yourself, you remove positioning and situational awareness from the equation.
---
You don't need two kits, just one total makeover kit. Switch to male find the horns that will swap over, then go back to female then use kit.
---
What hardcore gameplay does anet allow for? Last I checked both the game and its players do as much as possible to bully hardcore players out of their game.
---
You played openworld pve before these updates. Might not have been a farming routine but its not exactly a massive shift in gameplay.
---
There is also a male only "hidden" horn set too. They're not glowy but you do get some neat dangly bits. :)
---
I really want them to change the sylvari hair so every style can be used regardless of gender. There are so many of the "male" hairstyles I'd love to use on my girls.
---
It also exposes lazy commanders. Had a lovely commander on adina where people we’re not stacking 2 per pillar and instead of assigning pairs or doing at least something, he just complained about making it too complicated and started kicking the people WHO WERE ACTUALLY SUGGESTING TO PAIR PEOPLE
---
Double-click the skill icon using your mouse. It forces the skill to be cast right at your feet. Guaranteed to not miss.
---
Moments like these I really wish you could click on someone and see their gear. Or, at least, their transmogs in effect.
---
&gt; I want an MMORPG to play and I heard that GW2 is really good but after looking at some reviews i have my concerns.
---
A lot has been said about the game.  Note, that reviews are going to tend to be critical because generally people don't say something unless they're unhappy with it.  I am not saying that GW2 hasn't had some problems (like all games), but the community is popular and thriving.  The recent actions by Blizzard/Activision have caused a lot of WoW players to come join us.
---
&gt; I've read that the leveling is great but that you can't progress in order to make activities less difficult, they say that activities will remain as hard as they are no matter what level you are. Is this true? 
---
Yes and no.  The game has two modes: leveling and end-game (level 80) content.  Leveling is your typical vertical progression.  You'll need to replace your low-level gear (try to keep your gear within 20 levels) and you'll gain new abilities (traits) as you level up.  This is important, as the game will easy you to the mechanics of the game.  At level 80, the kiddie gloves will come off.  You'll want get your character into exotic level gear.  All of the game is tuned to this level (except fractals, which has another gear leveling system).  You can continue to advancing towards Ascended/Legendary gear, but that will net you about 5% additional stats.  The real difference in difficult will be your skill at playing the game.
---
There is a huge difference between players who just stand there an auto-attack and using your traits and skills effectively.  Skills do more than just "hit target for 223 to 438 points of damage."  They induce effects, like making the target vulnerable to more damage, cause all strikes for the next 5 seconds to cause additional fire damage or drain life on hit.  A good player will trait into a set of abilities that magnify a certain choice of effects and then use skills in order/combinations that trigger them.   Want to take less damage?  You need to learn literally to dodge out of the way of attacks.  Having played as a hard-core raider in WoW, knowing I can't win just because I don't have the gear feels artificial.  I like the fact that whether or not I win or lose is based on my skill at the scenario, not just because I have ground out a high enough item level to get past it.
---
&gt; And, if I were to buy the game, should I buy the DLC?, which DLC are the best? Thanks.
---
You can play the game for free to level 80.  There is _a lot_ of content to witness just in that.  There are two expansions, both have benefits.  Hearth of Thorns has the next story line and the ability to use gliders.  Gliders are a great way to escape combat by jumping off a ledge and flying away.  Path of Fire has mounts, which are arguably the best single mechanic ever done in any MMO.  They're not just for travel, but an integral part of exploration and combat.  Also, there are the Living Stories, which are episodes telling the storyline of GW2.  It's all good.  Like, really good content.
---
If you really want to take it slow getting into the game, I would by PoF first.  Doing the first part of the first story in PoF will unlock your raptor mount for your account.  That will make traveling around fun.  Also, you'll get out of the free-to-play account restrictions, which can be annoying.
---
Coming from a dzagonur thief... literally rock bottom in the wvw pecking order.
---
Nice kill :)   
---
Were the scourges responsible for boon strip or just chrono auto attack?
---
That is wrong. It is like this:
---
* Enemy
---
 * Critter - White name
---
     * Extremely low armor and often also very low health that makes it very easy killing them in one hit. Won't retaliate when attacked. 
---
 * Unhostile - Yellow name
---
     * Normal enemies, but won't attack unless aggroed. They **will** hit you will collateral damage if they are attacking someone else. 
---
 * Hostile - Red name
---
     * They have a default aggression value towards players, and will almost always attack when they detect you, if they have skills to attack (if they don't have skills they may just walk to you or stand still doing nothing).  
---
* Ally - Green name
---
 * Can receive boons and healing from you.
---
* Neutral - Green name
---
 * Can't attack or be attacked by players or enemies and mostly ignore fights altogether.
---
Is that not a BL chest skin? I have it and I never purchased it.
---
It's dead and dried.
---
You can't kill what's already dead.
---
Ouch my feelings. The other responses to my comment proves my point. Watching 5 years of crying and whining, I gotta pretty good grasp on it.
---
Wow. That’s incredibly stupid! What happened to him?
---
I think changing the unidentified gear to be according to the level of your character as you open it would make the raid rewards more valuable (at least for those savvy enough to identify them on a low level character) and would, perhaps, increase the value of the lvl 80 materials on the tp.
---
No you're genuinely retarded, and desert bl was related to a massive drop in wvw playerbase despite being an update. But clearly you know better without having the slightest idea on the changes done to the map.
---
Hence genuinely retarded ;)
---
It's just like the Jahai rifts, if you pan your camera slightly while looking at the rift, Kralk is just staring at you through them.
---
Ranger, Guardian, Warrior.
---
Ranger can be DPS or healer in raids, and even as DPS they can bring good utility.
---
Guardian can also be DPS or healer, and they can be used to bring additional boons a druid can't/to make up for lack of Chronomancers.
---
Warrior is a desirable supportive DPS that brings lots of might.
---
In my experience, all three are relatively easy to learn rotation wise (maybe Condi zerker is harder than the other two, but still not crazy hard, and I haven't personally learned soulbeast rotations) so shouldn't require a huge time investment compared to learning, say, elementalist/mesmer rotations.
---
Same with non-k i5-6600 and gtx 960. Actually got lower fps
---
I've never played the first game. This music is absolutely beautiful. It feels so epic but serene at the same time.
---
Generally speaking, mixing different triple combinations is a bad idea, especially if a quad-stat exists that covers what the three-stat combo is providing.
---
The trinkets that mix two triples (like the Jade Wind Orb you linked) are somewhat of a noob trap. Triples have lower stat budgets than quads, so you're basically spreading yourself over four stats with fewer points than you would normally get by just committing to a quad.
---
Quad-stat gear has almost 10% more stat points compared to triple-stat gear.
---
Game desperately needs optimization in the wake of this whole anet restructuring.
---
Thanks a lot for this. FYI, though, Skyscale makes it a lot easier :)
---
I'm so upset that the Norn are basically just a caricature of themselves. There's so much that could be done with them. I feel like they're the most forgotten race in terms of lore and development.
---
LOL how does that refute what I said? You have to resort to name calling? Further advancing my point why it's a waste or time making new content for people that act like you.
---
don't pay much attention to it, the lore in this game is a mess
---
Reused assets.
---
thank you very much, that was very helpful.
---
&gt;not being able to switch to other runes / sigils which make you better  in either gamemode is already a huge drawback, so this is not really  gonna happen if you do not want to be somewhat efficient in both  gamemodes.
---
This is a fair point but I often find that I'm happy to use the same runes and sigils across the different game modes.  I'm not really the kind of person who sticks strictly to meta builds
---
&gt;if you plan to raid at some point, you will get a lot of shit for  running defensive stats on a role which shouldn't. especially when you  start stealing aggro from a tank where a tank is used because of  toughness.
---
With my plan, I would be running fully offensive in raids anyway as the armour and weapons would be berserkers or viper's as appropriate
---
&gt;i would rather make a wvw only char then with which you do not need to  do anything in the pve map anyway. no need to regear etc the whole time  and you can enjoy some fashionwars by having 2 of each class you play.  relogging is easier in this case.
---
I have considered this in the past but I don't think this really fits what I'm trying to do.. it'd involve making more armour, more weapons, more trinkets etc and i'd also need to buy more character slots.  Plus, as pathetic as this sounds, I like my existing characters :)
---
Aaaa shatter does not give teammates alac? Omg I must learn it again ... thanks for point that out man
---
Imo the first 2 bosses are really well done and are probably great for training beginners because the first requires awarness and the second is almost exclusiv about its breakbar.
---
Excellent work.
---
Source: anet laid off over 1/3 of the devs, there is no expansion coming after living world, and the vast majority of the games new "content" is non-repeatable and unengaging, and long term players are leaving the game in droves
---
And here he is again.
---
When the playerbase drops dramatically and the most common reason given is framerate issues and optimization...either that or they'll do some sort of analysis and determine it's cheaper to shutdown the game...
---
I don't like cheap reskins, exactly.
---
&gt; Deadeye has no cc capabilities at all
---
Can't you just take Basilisk Venom and sacrifice a bit of dps from not having the stealth elite?
---
the plural of asura is asura not "asurans"
---
If you are going to play a garbage race, at least know how to talk about it without sounding like a brainlet
---
I was hoping I'd get an answer considering the maths of things and that's what you've given - thanks :)
---
&gt;Generally speaking, mixing different triple combinations is a bad idea,  especially if a quad-stat exists that covers what the three-stat combo  is providing.
---
Would you recommend trying to mix in Marauder trinkets with my Berserker armour and weapons then (instead of Soldiers)?  Or is having a full set of Marauders the only way to go?  I really do want to avoid having so many sets of armour and weapons if I can.
---
&gt;The trinkets that mix two triples (like the Jade Wind Orb you linked)  are somewhat of a noob trap. Triples have lower stat budgets than quads,  so you're basically spreading yourself over four stats with fewer  points than you would normally get by just committing to a quad.
---
Oh the Jade Wind Orb is just a poor man's "Dire" option.  I'm not really using the Precision it provides.
---
Lol, classic. As if the rewards for repeating raids weren't garbage enough, they actually went and made them worse. Somehow. Bravo Anet, you never cease to amaze me. Make sure to buff the rewards for gathering elder wood!
---
Try reading that again.
---
Do we know that the Raid takes place after the death of Kralkatorrik though?
---
NCSoft is the parent company so the key should work. Or send a support ticket if it doesn't.
---
Fractals are fun and a chill way to gear a character. If you do the daily fractals you get a chance at ascended drops and also a lot of other loot. You can use pristine fractal relics to get ascended trinkets as well.
---
Oh you tease. Just beautiful
---
Alright. Thank you so much for the quick reply!
---
"More violets, I say. Less violence!"
---
Yes.
---
Mixing Marauder with Berserker is fine. It's actually often the best thing you can do in game types like WvW.
---
You should still probably try and get a full set of Berserker's equipment since every class will benefit from this.
---
Playable stone dwarves is all I want from this game. It’s all I’ve wanted for a long, long time. Yes, tengu would be cool. But rocking a stone dwarf is what this game needs!
---
I’ve tried guardian, it seems really fun but it seems to be more of a support class, maybe I’m just not playing it right. Obviously the dps won’t be as good as something like an ele. How do they hold up in PvP/WvW?
---
I never needed to because I had gotten credit for the collection before the fix went live. Which now needs the boots for Visions of Dragonfall, not the chest.
---
If you do have the boots, support may take some time to get back to you due to how backlogged they are right now.
---
I might try to get hold of a set of Marauder trinkets then and compare them to my Soldier's ones.
---
I've got a full berserker set already: berserker armour and weapons and a set of berserker trinkets (to go with the set of soldier's trinkets that i swap them out for in WvW).
---
I never liked the idea that in order to maximize gold income I had to buy a character slot to make a character with but couldn't actually **play.**
---
Whole game, at mid it didn’t happen, but on blue side home I couldn’t see anything.
---
Are scourges really that good or are they just fun to play or something? I liked reaper more when trying it out in the pvp training area.
---
To be fair, FFXIV seeks to be balanced between jobs above anything else.  Jobs don't really have unique utility because they want any random party to be able to complete any content and they try to make sure no job/job combination is "determined to be required" by the community.  For example, if you wanted to take a BRD, "meta" parties would take a DRG to apply piercing debuff.  The devs want to eliminate this kind of perception so stuff like that are getting removed and some roles (looking at you healer) are becoming homogonized in the sense that no particular job is special in any way. 
---
 Personally, I think each job plays quite differently, even among similar roles (DRG doesn't feel like MNK, BRD doesn't feel like MCH, RDM plays totally differently from SMN and BLM, etc).
---
Firebrand is the supporty one right? Are they good for pvp or should I play the dragon one for that?
---
To be perfectly honest it sounds like you know more then me. I would argue though that it seems absurd on the surface that such an old engine would make a better performing mmo than a brand new engine, even if said engine isn't optimized for MMOs specifically. But maybe I'm showing my ignorance on the matter there.

[ARENA NET] [Rubi Bayer.8493 posted on 2019-06-13 17:03:59](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/951308#Comment_951308):
---
&gt; We have another update on this event series! Some good news to start: We've sorted out the bug that caused the event to stall last time.
---
&gt;In addition, to make the event less confusing, Wild-Eye Miller will be more clear that this is a donation as part of a global community effort, and will announce when the new recipe is unlocked.
---
&gt;The new Mystic Forge recipe will be available for all players once it's unlocked, and players can progress the related achievements during all of the events in this series regardless of whether or not they participated in the first event.
---
&gt;We know some of you are disappointed that you didn’t get to participate in the first round, and we expect future events will last longer to give more people a chance to contribute.
---
&gt;With all of that said, we hope you're ready for the next event in the series, because Wild-Eye Miller is waiting for you in Lion's Arch right now! 
---
&gt; So let me ask this in return: Why should the - at least according to most non-raiders - most challenging content actually give less loot than running in a cricle on a nearly empty map, pressing 'interact' once in a while?
---
I mean arguably it doesn't though. There are unique cosmetics from raids which is the entire endgame here.
---
Personally I think they look like shit but they exist.
---
Also the reason running around a map and farming is more gold is because of supply and demand - If raids gave more money then more people would raid, Less people would be running around maps farming thus increasing prices further until they once again are ahead of raids.
---
It's like the raid was delayed.
---
I'm not arguing with you; agreeing.  My original point was the way for them to succeed would be to write or use a newer, optimized engine (hello multi-core support).
---
So first we had mithril, now volatile magic.
---
u/that_shaman datamined the following info from last patch:
---
* Mighty Trophy Donations
---
* Magical Trophy Donations
---
* Jungle Material Donations
---
* Ascended Material Donations
---
* Ectoplasm Donations
---
Those are probably the donations still to come.
---
Mighty and magical trophy donations are most likely the fine materials (claws, bones etc) used for the gifts of might and magic.
---
Jungle donations could cover plenty of mats that could use a sink, thorns etc...
---
Ascended donations its hopefully dragonite etc...
---
To add onto this it's really easy to set up advertising on Google ads. You can also report these but you typically have to represent the organization that owns the content that the advertising is infringing on.

There's multiple achievements.  You can donate 1, 10, 25, 100, or 250.  There's an achievement for donating once at every denomination (gives 3 AP, Mystic Benefactor title, and 10 mystic grab bags), and 4 levels of total donation achievements.  The first for 250, then 500, then 750, then 1000.  The first three achievements are one-time, and give 1, 2, and 3 AP respectively, along with more grab bags.  The final achievement, for 1000, is repeatable, giving 3 AP each time, up to 15 total.  No clue how much he needs from the community overall, as the event only shows a generic progress bar.
---
The Mystic Grab Bags mostly give unid gear and random crafting supplies, with an uncommon chance at various keys, a rare chance at various named exotics, and a super rare chance at the Queen Bee, Confetti, or new Mystic infusions.
---
Millions.
---
Also Queen bee and Chak infusions are way too small on Asura compare to other race. Can barely see it on Asura.

7nm vs 14nm+++.  I bet AMD wins in single core perf by like 5% and multicore by like 30%

Literally a picture of the currency exchange page...

I hope so, i am(maybe soon was) an intel fan boy but they seriously need some competition so they dont sit on their asses doing nothing.

&gt; Here's a quick message from the developers:
---
&gt;When we released The Mythwright Gambit raid wing, we introduced a limited means to exchange Legendary Insights for Legendary divinations. Alongside this most recent raid release, we have reversed this exchange. You can now exchange Legendary Divinations for Legendary Insights as many times as you’d like.
---
&gt;We’re now at 7 raid wings and while Legendary Armor is still incredibly sought after, players may feel pressured to complete older raid content to get the required Legendary Insights. This change will allow you to make progress towards your legendary armor while participating in the most current raid content.
---
Well..I guess gw1 had pretty good amount of content, but they still abandoned it after 3(4?) expansions
---
The underwater bubble helmet is also off centre for asura, where it’s perfectly centred for humans lol
---
They would still be in the lead if they didn't try to make their chips themselves.  AMD outsources to TSMC.
---
Brilliant, thank you.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/680435/#Comment_680435
---
Link to the comment where they said there would not be a time limit on the exchange.
---
Anet, we need better communication.
---
Wow it wasn't even made that long ago.  
---
I don't raid often at all, but why create an option to switch LI to LD during the period they had no use and then remove it when it does have a use?  Even of the whole "not a timegate" thing was disregarded, it makes no sense to do this.
---
Ok I'll go Photoshop my Charr getting sent to the Doghouse by my wife next time
---
They just screwed me over pretty hard then.
---
If anything they should have given us a warning before the patch hit so we knew. This isn't cool.
---
That explains the view marks.
---
Just to add up to this mess:  [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/680448/#Comment\_680448](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/680448/#Comment_680448) 
---
"You don't immediately have to participate in the exchange. If you're working on your armor right now, you could choose to complete it and then exchange any further insights you acquire at your leisure, provided you've made measurable progress against any one of the encounters in Hall of Chains."
---
More profit IF they succeed.
---
Play another game, or take a break. Watch some hentai, you deserve it.
---
I'm curious if the comment came up in the level 20 area because someone thought you were a new player. I'd imagine it would be much harder for a new player to randomly wander into Dry Top, so I'd probably be more likely to assume it was just a veteran who generally knows what he's doing.
---
It seems likely it will roll over to another material after this one so hopefully you can get it SOMEHOW.
---
Yeah, okay, different cases, I had all the boot skins unlocked prior to opening the box and figured opening the box was (for some dumb reason / bug) needed as I had already had the skins unlocked prior to obtaining the achievement. This was not the case so now, literally this is the only sub-achievement I need to move on to stage II.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Anet laying off the devs want because Guild Wars lost money, it's because of other Anet/NCSoft ventures that went nowhere and they had to recoup the money from somewhere. That, plus the economy is going downhill right now I'm general. 
---
GMC laid off 15% of it's workforce just a couple months ago. Is GM a dead company? Lol
---
They just released a new raid wing and have started they will be releasing LW season 5.
---
The wording seems to indicate it's one a week.
---
They clearly made this change not realizing what they themselves said 9 months ago.  Now they are caught in a bold face lie and I'm sure they will try and spin it some way or just delete the old comment so it looks like they were in the right.  Pathetic
---
after we fill the bar they will give us a  MF recipe to discover, you dont even need to participate in the event
---
I'll rate Scourge a -2 for being designed as a support and ending up actually being a ridiculous damage spec.
---
Everything else I find to be designed rather well, even if they aren't always played the way they were intended to.
---
Earth Djinn looks like a real pugmuncher
---
I don't participate in these events because honestly my attention span is too short to figure it out. It all seems needlessly complicated. Now I hear there's an achievement I missed out on? I guess what else is new. This game does that more often making achievements missable.
---
All that happened here is they forgot the change and communication they did previously regarding the topic.
---
Kinda like how they forget why they do certain balance changes within a week of the update going live.
---
Basically a "firing and forgetting" memory.
---
u didnt miss out on anything, u can do those achiev now and they will make more events like this again with different material to donate after one event is finished they will give us a mf recipe to discover like the last one and you dont need to participate in the event to be able to use these recipes
---
Dany kinda forgot about the Iron Fleet too.
---
The more you work the less you get? Its raids we talking about here.. not an open world boss.
---
The DPS rotations of healers were never complicated. They've pretty much capped out at some long duration DOTs that need less than 66% duration to be GCD efficient and their spam-able nuke.
---
The complexity was always from minimizing your use of GCD healing, maximizing your oGCD usage, and minimizing forced movement. \*Given that people are still bad at this\* that's not about to change. I had a raid run where I died and had to suffer the entire post-raise damage penalty and I still did more damage than &gt;70% of people who killed the fight on my job, and my class only has one DOT.
---
As long as this sort of thing remains true I can say that healers are the hardest role in high end content, because the low end content doesn't push healers hard enough and somehow you still find people who struggle to heal even the most basic dungeons.
---
Is it a lie if the person who said it wasn't part of the change that removed it?
---
Obviously it's a mistake then.  But it doesn't have to be a lie.
---
If going for the achievements, this will probably be the cheaper method unless they eventually do unbound magic.
---
60 FPS isnt hard for CPUs and resolution only affects GPUs.
---
someone let me know if we can use crystal cores?
---
Oh my god I love you so much right now, this is my holy grail
---
EDIT: delta, why you so good to us
---
The original comment wasn’t just one developer saying it, it would have been confirmed by the whole raid team. So yes, it’s a lie
---
It really depends on people that are still buying them really.. Cant exactly tell what price point they will reach. As for post event they may actually rise a bit due to no longer being obtainable.
---
If it is a mistake then they should add the exchange again, if not it is just a lie.
---
How do you know they wont after realizing said mistake?
---
Do you feel they have even been given a fair chance to correct it yet?
---
Dang it, so it might be over before I get back home from work in 5-6 hours?
---
I put him on friend list and make sure won’t see him in my pugs in T4

We always try to be nice to others, and politely leave if we found the group doesn’t fit us
---
Same with WoW. 25 or 40+ man raids/world bosses 4k 60fps easy and over 150fps at 1080p. DX12 helped loads. Best part is WoW's aesthetic is amazing and not tainted by disgusting aliasing like GW2 either.
---
That could be interesting, though in PvE at least the effects would need a significant improvement as they're pretty weak.
---
I think a lot of the issues stem from the fact that the profession is trying to fill two roles: support and condi DPS. I would say the class actually functions pretty well as a support (a little *too* well even), but then elements like the torch and boon corrupt and damage traits all feel half-arsed and don't fit the rest of the spec.
---
Likely, since it looks like they're trying to make all metas as rewarding as each other (as much as possible). They may have gone through a buff phase recently, but we can't forget that, before then, it was just pure nerfs.
---
They don't get better drops, they get more valuable drops. Valuable because they are one of the only sources of lower tier crafting materials, which, along with the higher tier crafting materials, are required to craft any Ascended and Legendary gear.
---
1. Players whining about not getting any communication in regards to the game.
---
2. Anet Team release some news/plan.
---
3. Anet deciding to change direction but now forever held hostage to that bit of news they released.
---
4. ...
---
5. Profit?!!
---
Yup pre-DX12 WoW you could run 200% render scale at 1080p (=4k) and still have more fps in a 25 man raid than GW2 doing jack shit. Now with the DX12 patch you get even more insanely good FPS.
---
People can be dicks about stacking under the boss, but they're right...the safest place at matriarch is in the center. Every attack, from the swipes to the flame breath, can be easily avoided just by taking a few steps through her hitbox, and she never charges if everyone is close. Also, if you misstep and go down, people will rez you in the stack, but they rarely go out of their way to save someone far away.
---
*Installs new gpu* "Where are my frames?" *looks online and finds out gw2 is cpu bound* "Well at least it is a pretty 30fps now."
---
So no rifle with accuracy?
---
If you're vendoring the map currencies, you're not concerned with their gold value anyway. Their vendor cost was approximately 1/10 of their actual potential gold value when converted into trade shipments.
---
Unlocking the elite specs requires hero points (which used to be called skill points) not mastery points! You need 250 hero points to fully unlock each elite spec; conveniently, each hero point awards you 10, unlike the core tyria ones which give only 1. Depending on how much of the core tyria map you have done, you may have enough to unlock a good chunk of one elite spec, but you will have to get hero points from either expansion's maps to finish it. Luckily, for HoT (and maybe PoF too?) there are regularly run hero point trains to help, since it's generally a pain to get most HoT hero points solo.
---
Mastery points are an entirely different thing, which you will also need to get, but not for the elite specs. Gliding and mounts require mastery points!
---
Can you elaborate?
---
Usually depends on how badly the rendering thread is loaded. Any non DX12 / non vulkan based render will struggle to efficiently offload rendering tasks across multiple threads.
---
A good multi threaded engine makes a massive difference. Try running battlefield 5 on a massively overclocked quad core - you will be bottle-necked by the CPU no matter how fast you can get it.
---
its a mix of defeat a champ/elite/veteran and just communing with it.
---
you can also use points from all regions for the elite spec you want. so HoT HPs also can be used for the PoF elite spec. they all go into the same pool
---
&gt;Just cause some dude
---
A company dev in their official forums.
---
&gt; said it a few weeks ago
---
It wasn't a few weeks ago.
---
&gt;they said it was limited back when the feature was released.
---
they said the exact opposite.
---
 https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/680435/#Comment_680435
---
Haha yes!
---
But there was already a hard limit to the exchange. The amount that could be exchanged was the amount of LI that could have been earned by doing Hall of Chains. So I and I'm sure many others were holding onto those to see if we wanted to trade them in for the trinket. And now that the trinket has finally come out I can't trade anymore, but like I said in my other comment:
---
&gt;On one hand, I'm upset because I was waiting to see if I wanted to trade them for the legendary trinket.
---
&gt;On the other hand, said trinket would be the same as Aurora for me.
---
Said dx12 converter makes the game crash a lot.
---
Some of my accounts don't have PoF, so vendoring was the only way I could make currency with them.
---
are you tired or never expected?
---
They still said it was a limited feature.
---
And now you simply can't...
---
I am literally showing you that when the feature was added a dev said it was **not limited in time**.
---
What is wrong with you
---
One dev yes, is that the whole company? Just cause one dev was mistaken doesn’t mean it’s true lol. Do you believe everything you read?
---
Can you link me to where it was stated to be limited? Thanks!
---
i donated enough to get the ap and 37 bags, best drop was a sw nightmare key
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wild-Eye_Miller
---
Not sure why people are downvoting you, since yeah, it's a mushroom, but the angle in the main pic makes it look like what you're saying.
---
Is this a real problem that would need any solution?
---
&gt;One dev yes, is that the whole company?
---
when in your life have you seen a whole company issuing statements.
---
You're beyond redemption.
---
Hi !
---
Yep I'm not a native english speaker, sorry for the mistakes \^\^
---
The reason I'm still asking is because I want to get an idea of what people think would be the "right" price for this kind of services, as there's not a lot of offers yet, whether they'll use it or not. 
---
Thanks for the feedbacks and your participation ! :)
---
And apparently you’ve never seen a dev being mistaken, they are human too. Keep crying ^^
---
It is so bugged atleast this instance where i am in.
---
Good to know that a JoJo plays GW2.
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
It's not really kiting. Idk why GW2 players use the term kiting so loosely. The boss stands still in one place but you need 3 players to stay at range all the time. They're not kiting anything.
---
I need 60 fps in raids, I don't care about 120 fps when looking at a tree.
---
&gt;And apparently you’ve never seen a dev being mistaken
---
Yes, I have seen one because this was a mistake, lmao.
---
Let's assume it was an honest mistake, but I'm wondering who looked at the already limited exchange and decided, let's get rid of this instead of adding a second option to exchange back.
---
Best case scenario I can imagine is that they wanted to push people into doing the PoF raids to get the PoF trinket and didn't realize it was a limited exchange and people couldn't get the trinket only with HoT currency. But in that same vein why implement the opposite exchange to let people get HoT raid armor with PoF's currency.
---
I don't think they went out of their way to upset the community by taking something away, but something definitely went wrong somewhere and it happened. Maybe someone meant for an additional exchange to be added and the person who made it happen actually replaced the old exchange instead by accident. We don't know, but some developer response would be nice.
---
Yeah, I got 16 bags and the best drop I got was a junk item worth 1 gold.
---
"It's a lifelong title."
---
More importantly, though, why use Pact Airships when we could catch up with the Aetherblades and steal one of theirs?
---
Why is it so complicated, couldnt they just give players LI for all raids and dont use divinations at all, it doesnt even make sense to use a complete new currency again.
---
&gt; how strange it is that the end-game content gear (Ascended &amp; Legendary) requires materials that cannot be obtained in endgame content
---
This is very much intended. Those lower tier mats drop most frequently in lower level maps. And their high value makes sure that those maps also give decent loot compared to end game maps. They are also mostly populated by newer accounts, so it also enables a wealth transfer from veteran players (crafting legendaries and ascended) to newer players to combat the wealth/pay gap.
---
Interesting post. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say you're probably a healer main.
---
This problem WAS NOT created by me.. It was created by Anet sneakily and without any notice or telling anyone that they changed the goalposts.
---
That's isn't 100% created by me... not even close.   If I'm using a home instance why can't I harvest everything available?
---
omegalul
---
There have been little optimizations throughout the game's lifetime that I've noticed (mostly with regard to model/texture management) but changing something like the core architecture of the game to support multiple cores efficiently is a significant undertaking that goes way beyond 'optimization'. 
---
There are little things that can be done, like splitting off non-engine components into their own threads (e.g. communication with the black lion store, data prefetching) and even some engine components (e.g. audio), but the core loop of `gather-&gt;compute-&gt;draw-&gt;gather-&gt;compute-&gt;...` can't always be broken down without significant changes to the way the core engine works.
---
And the scary part about changing the engine core is the law of unintended consequences. GW2 probably has hundreds of thousands if not millions of lines of code and hundreds of layers of abstraction. One small change to a core item (e.g. how models are loaded and drawn when a user enters a map) could have far-reaching effects. The test space for that is enormous (literally every map, every encounter) and so it makes validation a long and painful task.
---
I would really love to see an overhaul of the engine but I don't know if, resource-wise, it would be the best use of the devs' time.
---
Event still up, and its about 15AP in total
---
By the way can I ask, when you talk about the levels you mean once you reach max level gear stays at that level, if so, this means that yes gear doesn't go any higher once you reach what's known as ascended gear, the highest stats. 
---
As other comments have stated it's a case of getting to know if the game through cooperation, skill use (rotations) and builds. Overall it's very fun in my opinion many ways to make currency, level-up and fight. 
---
DLC makes the game very different and adds a lot, however play through the base game for free first to get the jist of the game. :D.
---
I was just logged in, it finished the bar and the animations happened. Worked fine?
---
Well I got my AP from it and that's all I really wanted from it lol. Couldn't give a rats ass about the skin.
---
I dont think thats accurate, most of the world seem okay with where triple A games are headed, the asian markets love the gacha model. The gaming market is just growing globally and will continu to do so with new innovations like VR. If you want old school games theres still smaller AA studios and Indie developers.
---
last year september they even said it's not a limited time exchange tho
---
Kralk is the grandfather...
---
Glint is the mother...
---
Some people on the forum are reporting it stopped for up to two hours but is now moving a pixel or two again, so who knows
---
I would not have objected to having more realms depicted, but what are they? Abaddon's Realm of torment... what are Lyssa's and Dwayna's called? I don't know enough about the GW1 lore but it's possible there wasn't enough history on those to add it without delaying production longer than we'd be willing to wait. Also if they make it too big then they'd have to make it two maps, and that would divide up the meta and break up the feel of the map.
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Goren
---
More then if we participated in the first one? How?
---
I always thought that the exchange was just to turn Dhuum LI's into LDs as they did introduced LDs for it too late.
---
That's correct and that's also why this change makes zero sense.
---
I can log out when I'm done donating, right? Would be bonkers to stay online until the event is over.
---
Doesnt it count towards the same achievement? Cause I toggled mine when the mithril one was going on, and I continued with it today and finished it.
---
This is relevant for people who have been raiding for a while.
---
&gt; Well, for people who can actually use the currency this was a legitimate fix. It removed the possibility of accidentally selling these currencies to a merchant.
---
That's why. They implemented a fix that positively affected players for whom the currency was relevant. They did not take into consideration the edge case players like yourself who I'm assuming are multiboxing and farming your own nodes on a bunch of accounts to scrape together a small amount silver from currencies that they cannot use on their account. Even if they did, the positive fix for the masses would greatly outweigh the small inconvenience for the handful of people like yourself. 
---
Really they should just remove the ability for people who don't have the expansions to use expansion nodes. Honestly I don't see this thread going anywhere but down with more petty argument and drama so I'm going to go ahead and just lock it.
---
ok, so they exist. Why not let them drop too?
---
I donated 75k and since few hours the progression bar for the event is NOT MOVING AT ALL
---
Is it Bug again ?
---
Nice Stonescale you have unlocked there.
---
Thats kinda sad for those other MMOs, if anything.
---
My chief complaint about the map currencies isn't the volume, but that the most efficient way to get them is grinding hearts. Dragonfall and Istan are great because I can acquire things from the meta events, which also happen to be very fun and well made. Meanwhile in Sandswept Isles I am a full time prairie dog exterminator, and in Jahai Bluffs I'm a matchmaker for the undead. By the time I get my Skyscale I'm pretty sure I'll never visit those maps again by choice
---
lol
---
A lie requires intent. I can't imagine they would intentionally mislead the players, it's a simple mistake/oversight/miscommuniaction in wake of the layoffs.
---
2) is definitely a common client bug.  If you move and watch your minimap, you'll see you're actually moving while stuck.  I've gotten quite good at 'flying blind' and when the client finally catches up I'll be at my destination.  For bonus points, you can dismount and pop-up at the 'correct' location.
---
[Story](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Story) is a good place to start but it also depends on what type of content you like to do and what you have available. Maybe check out some [builds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) and see what you want to work on. This may then involve getting hero points to unlock an elite spec and getting [gear](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) for the character. Maybe start off with fractals then think about getting into raids. Really though just going through all the story and new zones you missed is already a pretty big endeavor.
---
A different company makes the hot dogs than the buns?  I'm not sure I understand what point you're trying to make.
---
Hmm. Going to dump this here.
---
When putting in an Anthology and Ecto Stone, Leaf Fossils and Barbed Thorns light up. The last recipe for True Mettle used the same two items. (Anthology and an Ecto Stone)  
---
* Anthology of Heroes  
---
* Ectoplasmic Stone
---
* Leaf Fossil, Barbed Thorns
---
* ???
---
-----
---
* Exotic Greatsword
---
Meanwhile it was about Airship Oil.
---
Flamethrower is not generally used in "end-game" DPS builds. Usually you'll go for Holosmith and use other stuff for that.
---
But for leveling, and generally for open-world you can do whatever you want. There are more than enough hero points in the game to learn all skills and traits.
---
uh.. isn't that exactly what they said on the linked page, that they didn't want people to feel pressured to do the old content. 
---
So you can do the new content and still get the old rewards if you want. Just not the other way around. I feel its weird in an mmo to be able to use the old currency to get the new rewards tbh since thats the opposite of what it normally is.
---
Didn't say the game sucks, people just mad when you have a legitimate criticism. I did ask and as I said, that's a convoluted process.
---
I'd imagine they will put the exchange thing on a rotation or just make both options available? Raid community is as small as it is, don't want to piss off what you have left.
---
If coalescence wasn't a complete letdown I would be so pissed about this
---
I am exactly in the same situation. I really hope they add the exchange again and soon. I am not going to do all the work again when last week I could exchange to get enough LD and now I would need many months to get the necessary LD.
---
Huh, never thought of it that way. I'd always simply buy 1.600 for $20 and get the remaining 400 by converting gold. No leftover gems. Did I just outsmart the system?
---
death is but a door. time is but a window. i'll be back.
---
https://youtu.be/9g3wDafZKU4
---
For what it's worth you can just exchange your extra gems for gold and have some use out of them.  Or save them for your next purchase where it can balance out.
---
In either case, I understand what you're saying... just I don't believe there will be much done.
---
Ideally there would be a way to purchase a very specific amount of gems, much like you can while exchanging gems and gold with eachother.
---
Considering that has been in place for eons yet the Gem packages have remained the same, I think we're better cutting our losses.
---
In addition to all the points others have made in this thread, the FFXIV raid model also appeals to a different sort of player type and business - think WoW and the like. 
---
In those games, raids are your primary source of progression - it's where you'll be getting all your fancy new gear each patch, and, most importantly, is what keeps you paying your subscription fee.
---
Thus, two sorts of trade-offs were made in GW2:
---
1. No subscription fee means not only less money towards development of any such new content, but less reason for the developers to encourage a gear-treadmill type playstyle that is often facilitated by traditional raids. Thus, we got fashion wars instead. In the end, this fact is sort of a vicious cycle or self fulfilling prophecy, and means we probably won't see a particularly major change in release cadence unless something else happens to shake up the business model, playerbase, or otherwise.
---
2. The original game was founded upon an all around "unique" and somewhat more casual formula that promised not to have the aforementioned gear treadmills, no hard trinity, and the like. Even while we have seen a shift away from some of these ideals with the advent of raids, the underlying principles are still in place and what we have in terms of gameplay but also playerbase doesn't lend itself to a sustainable rate for release, while also keeping the new raids at least somewhat unique with fresh mechanics and aesthetics. 
---
Not only that, but there's a good amount of vacancy to make up for as well from the time before raids. Again, this is a fault of the original concept for the game and a feeling that raids were unneeded for the first 3 years of the game's life, so take that as you will.
---
It was limited to a set amount, was perfectly fine tbh. The main issue is they should have given a heads up before changing it. It's not even in the patch notes.
---
Yet they included them but failed to add the ultimate fights for XIV which is the hardest content in the entire game ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
This kills the Avdol.
---
Anet : "We've sorted out the bug that caused the event to stall last time."
---
Trump : "ANET IS VERY FAKE NEWS !"
---
Well, It's bugged AGAIN : the event progression bar is not filling up. Okay...
---
drooburt is steve confirmed
---
More likely they're using a sliding goal to make sure it stays open for a decent amount of time.
---
Guess I would care more about it if the Coalescence would have a different and acceptable visual effect - which it doesn't have.
---
However it is still not a good move by ANet, and hopefully they'll reverse this change, so everyone is going to be able to exchange 168 LIs to LDs.
---
your wrong the game is dead
---
go look at how many twitch viewers GW2 has right now and compare it to literally any other game. ffs even bloody runescape has 10x the viewers
---
or just log into the game and look at the lfg to see for yourself
---
You want 2000 gems, but you will have to buy more, this way company gets more dollars from from you, You do end up paying more that you need, but still keep the value in terms of leftover gems could be spend on stuff later.
---
In example with buns, you'll make 8 sandwiches, with 2 dogs left, you can spoil and dispose of, consume without the buns, or whatever, also you could buy more buns for those dogs, and later more dogs for buns... sort of creating an artificial demand for both.
---
Sort of a way for a company to charge you extra for thing you currently do not need. But not really overcharging you as you would use resources at some point. 
---
And the second layer is you can turn gems into gold, and vise versa creating demand for gems on the market, for those who do not want to pay with dollars, can pay with gold, those who want gold will pay dollars instead.
---
As a result company has dollars and can keep the game running, and everyone benefits.
---
The answer is Magic.
---
Yeah it’s interesting because at least you do have some leftover gems to use for something else or exchange for gold. Since the sky scale costs 2k, everyone is buying 2400 gems, but if the sky scale was 2400 gems, the same people would still buy 2400 gems. They just wouldn’t have anything left over.

---
They can't. You can see the tools but they are not for purchase. They fixed they early yesterday. So no worries. It's also posted on their forum.
---
Yes, all you had to do was kill 1 Hall of Chains boss before the release of wing 6 to be eligible to exchange LI to LD. And the hard limit was 168, which is more than the 150 needed to craft the ring.
---
This shouldn't be about LD or LI or legendaries or raids. This should be about trust and communication. Even people who don't care about all the stuff I mentioned should be showing their disapproval of this decision.
---
it would also be nice to fix the bug where you cant even buy gems
---
Makes sense, but it just makes it more complicated.
---
Honestly, I agree with you wholeheartedly.
---
However, from a business standpoint I see why Anet does it and doubt it'll change, as it's a good system for them as the extra money they get offsets the money lost from people turned off from buying gems from the system. Not to say there's not a better way, but in business it comes to analytics, and not sure if they have much market research from systems that do what you suggest.
---
Anet has Reverse-Engineered the Asuran "No Time Limit Exchange Technology" and then Anet was then able to get rid of it without warning anyone.
---
xD
---
Hold on, are you saying that yet again, the event started and finished while most of their customer base was at work?
---
Oh, sure, same here. But I'd still rather have the ability to just look for myself.
---
oh yes pls, i want more too!
---
wtf, never had this until now
---
This is stupid. I remember very well that they said there would be no time limit !!!!!
---
This is precisely why I didn't exchange, waiting to know what LD were for.
---
Well, of course they can still correct the mistake if it is one. But keep in mind that they prefer not to fix things if it doesn't seem necessary. And if people don't voice their opinion they won't care. A big reddit post with some awards and lots of upvotes/comments and a big thread on the forum will certainly catch their attention and hopefully make them review the matter.
---
i love it!
---
I call them 'unhostile' because it's shorter than non-hostile, but there's many other ways to call it. "non-aggressive", "peaceful", "tranquil", "calm". Anything that may mean they won't aggro first while not leaving out that may change.
---
Neutral won't mean they won't attack first in GW2, but that they stay out of combat altogether. 
---
In many games neutral may mean that they won't hit first and won't come to help you, like a villager, but in those kinds of games you may attack allies and be able to play evil characters. GW2 isn't that kind of game. Teams are strictly fixed except for events and scripted behaviors that may switch your team like guild races and renown hearts. And you can never go raid a village like in skyrim. Neutral is strictly neutral. 
---
In GW2  neutral character would be completely out of fights, like these merchants that stands there doing nothing while the world burns around them. 
---
Yellow name creatures WILL hit you even if you don't hit first, if they are hitting someone else and you get caught in the attack, some will even turn aggressive just by being near them. That is not neutral in GW2's terms in any sane person's book.
---
Same. This is an absolute joke.
---
It's responses like these that make me somewhat wish they would just leave it as it is now just to spite these remarks.
---
It may be easier on their end to have 5 "products" available for purchase. a $10 item, a $20, a $35, $50, $100. They fit the needs of MOST users, and are easy enough prices to remember or think about.
---
What you are suggesting is a "by the pound" system. You want to buy 579 gems? That will be $7.24? See how that over complicates the system?
---
From a simplicity standpoint (also, incentivizing those susceptible to impul$e buying with the leftover gems) the first is a clear winner.
---
Oh really, I assumed it was 250 at least considering how long its taken to come out.
---
Even so, recent revelations about Kralkatorrik's Torment tell us that he was still way beyond help long before the gods had arrived, and it's likely the same could be inferred for the other dragons.  In that respect, the gods wouldn't have been able to champion them even if they tried.
---
Who says they're even speaking the truth? Don't be so quick with your judgement.
---
op treb kills clearly work out fine :)))
---
You're welcome to think about it in those terms all you want, but your definitions are neither the officially provided ones (which don't exist) nor the most commonly used ones.
---
Keep in mind why the exchange even existed in the first place. It existed so people, who had participated in W5 before LD were a thing, could get the LD they missed out on. If you start raiding now then you aren't eligible for the exchange anyway and if you raided W5 before W6 release then why would they devalue your time investment *now*? It just doesn't make sense to remove the option.
---
This is nice and dandy and all but how many bosses do each raids have? Gw2 has 3 but I know WoW has like 8-12 bosses per raid and that's the huge massive difference.
---
Lmao. GW2 has 987 and RuneScape has 517 as of the time of your comment.
---
You PoS, salty, little, lying bitch.
---
This is Goren.
---
He was a mommy.
---
This is Shiny.
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shiny
---
That was his baby. 
---
We've seen the mommy dead, but not the baby. And that can mean one thing, and only one thing: Shiny went on a Disney adventure, and now we have to find her.
---
q time is fine most of the time. we need some more quality players tho
---
&gt;The exchange was never explicitly stated to be time-limited.
---
In case you didn't see it yet check out the [link in this guys post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c0960g/turns_out_there_was_a_limited_means_to_exchange/er2syxc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
It only costs 25g. And you can merch them back for 20g.
---
5g is not a big risk for a potentially huge payoff.
---
Let's say Leaf Fossil go up to 80c. That means about a 60g profit.
---
Is this a joke? They mentioned it was limited when it came out, nobody complained then.
---
old school runescape you genius, not RS3 no one plays that trash
---
"WvW/PvP players: still no option for legendary trinkets to be obtained in either of these gamemodes."
---
We're still missing two leg trinkets.  Maybe they'll be wvw, and pvp next.
---
I am in bed right now, probably awake in 7 or so hours. Making an event a weekend long is too hard I guess.
---
This is some of the most pointlessly contrarian bullshit I've ever read.
---
Was there a reward for the event itself? Last time I logged off and got nothing.. actually I just logged off today too after donating.
---
For open world you can run whatever pretty much. 
---
Be aware tho that flamethrower is useless in any other game mode, due to Retaliation on enemies. Flamethrower autoattack hits 10 times per cycle, 5 times per second, which is about 1000 dmg to yourself. Per second.
---
Limited in quantity (168 maximum) but not time.
---
This is about trust and communication and you should disapprove, even if you don't care about raiding or whatever.
---
They did trade combat fidelity for performance though, anyone who has ever done PVP in that game knows how much dogshit the engine is
---
Yeah imo would be kind of hard without comms, although we didn’t really need them. Strat was to drop your pillar and go back to the one you dropped so it’s always just 5 people searching. Air is hard w/o comms for synching CC of the rechargeable cc bar. We fucked it up even with comms.
---
if you need a gear treadmill than gw2 maybe isnt for you. but even than playing to max lvl and play throu all endcontent (map completion, maybe craft a legendary weapon, fractals, raids) will worth the money to buy at least one expansion (i would even say buy the bundle from PoF and HoT for 50 Euro). Gw2 is clearly a great game worth every penny of it.
---
Last time you didn't get the 5k karma if you left the map/logged out.  Dunno if they changed that.
---
2: the stuck on the floor oddly only happens in base skins. I use my ninetails jackal on places with a lot of people to avoid this.
---
If you want to be viable for open world PvE then flamethrower engie is great. You've got strong AoE and an unholy amount of utility at your disposal.
---
If you want to take your PvE to endgame group content then playing engineer already puts you in a good place, although you might need to put down the flamethrower in favour of hard-light laser weapons. The elite spec Holosmith (a powerful max-level subclass) that comes with Path of Fire is a very strong DPS class and can do a lot of heavy lifting in endgame content.
---
The other elite spec (from Heart of Thorns) is Scrapper. While not as widely praised as Holosmith it has its place for engineers that like getting up close and smacking fools with a hammer and also has a fair bit of supporting/tanking power. As it happens, a close range bruiser skillset also happens to work *really well with a flamethrower build*.
---
As a bonus, If you're playing around Halloween be sure to take your flamethrower for a spin in the Mad King's Labyrinth. You can turn on action camera and run around toasting people like you're playing a shooter game.
---
Ah!  That all makes sense, thank you for taking the time to reply!
---
looks like something my mesmer needs!
---
I don't think we agree, but maybe we are talking at cross purposes.  
---
You can't just add more cores for more power, two 3 GHz cores isn't the same as one 6 GHz ones. There is additional overhead like moving data around and communicating. Also every task can necessarily be broken down and parallelized.  
---
It depends on what you mean by "optimization"
---
Luckily I had  quiet some map currency from all maps in my bank. Jahai was above 250, many were around 150 to 200. For people, that played the LWS and did some achievements in them it shouldn't be that much of a grind. I enjoyed getting back to the maps and have lots of folks everywhere (because they too were working on the saddle parts). :)
---
Ps: Skyscale is totaly worth it. There are some people here that think the dragon is basically a worse bunny mount, but it's actually the oposite. You can reach higher places with Skyscale and you have a lot more control while doing it. Together with the double dash you're also reasonably fast. I love it! :)
---
Pretty sure that both GW2 and FFXIV teams have around 250 people and the boss design team at FFXIV is under 10 people
---
Is this raid boss count or just raid count?
---
No. But if you could not code human like macro by yourself in 21st century you missing a bit.
---
3 months, actually. 90 days.
---
mesmer ftw! best class hehe! :)
---
Regarding the healing: make sure to always detonate your healing turret after deployment for a sizeable area of effect heal. Never put it down and let it run for the regeneration it puts out, that regeneration doesn't amount to much. 
---
If the healing from the turret detonation isn't enough and you are constantly dying, or close to dying, you are taking too much damage and should dodge more.
---
&gt;Spending more money does not give a better rate of gems received.
---
This is a good thing.
---
But you know its a normal tactic, right?
---
You mean 7 for Gw2 8 for ESO and 18 for FF?
---
HI all, first: This is not my video. I just found it and love it and thought i share it. Hopefully it make you laugh too.
---
YAAAAAAAS HE LIVES ON he’s serving LOOKS he’s serving Ahdashim 2019 couture sis is gonna snatch our wigs and get that cash prize of one hundred thousand gold I stan so HARD
---
Well, I would say that t4 100 is rather great indication of raid-like difficulty, just join group "at 2nd boss" and behold all the clownfiesta of typical training raid. Yea a lot of t4 fractals are easy, but you usually have at least one hard on the daily list.
---
A lot of people didnt move on from GW1 tho
---
Okay thanks!
---
That is a rly misleading stastic. Befor Wing1 was a thing there was no plan to make raids. To make it fair u had to start counting on Realse of the First raid.(and that is not rly fair too)
---
That's what I expected too, that it would be a universal one-time achievement and not event specific. Can anyone confirm that's the case?
---
This is true indeed, old ones were a lot better in that department, but stormblood drop the ball hard 
---
Honestly a lot of people (mainly raiders) in gw2  wouldnt complain at all if they focus more on mechanics and realesing more raids, than how the instaces look , gw2 focus too much resources on that while FFXIV saw that poeple dont care as much and just want cool encounters , but i bet a big part of gw2 playerbase would call it lazy , or unpolish if they do that compared to ffxiv playerbase
---
Just raid count and as a result is pretty misleading and not a clear comparison.
---
How the heck did you come to this conclusion? Check out the link in [this guys post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c0960g/turns_out_there_was_a_limited_means_to_exchange/er2syxc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and compare it to the one OP linked. One says the exchange for LI -&gt; LD is "not a time limited exchange" and the other, as you incorrectly labeled it *entirely separate and unrelated change,* literally says "introduced a limited means to exchange Legendary Insights for Legendary divinations ". **It is the fact that there's a contradiction in statements.**
---
Repeatable and you get a title
---
I agree, but the issue is they never said it was limited time only.
---
They could've limited it by when people got the kill or whatever, I'm not working at Arenanet. But this was definitely never advertised as limited time only. So I sat on my 1k LI to link until something worthwhile comes around. They should've communicated that it goes away and people eligible could have turned them in beforehand.
---
I barely have done 3 raids and thought that raids where coming out too fast anyway. As the raid community is so small I don't think its worth moving resources to speed up raid releases when it could be used on other things.
---
This is a pretty misleading or incomplete comparison. There doesn't seem to be consideration of how big the raids are or of variable repeatable difficulties which increase the lifespan of raids.
---
A direct comparison probably isn't all that easy to make but Guild Wars 2 is definitely lacking for new releases of all instanced PvE content sadly.
---
All this did for me was make the game run slower, everything else on my computer is still suffering
---
Maybe if Coalescence's visual effect didn't look like utter garbage i'd be more invested in these shenanigans, but I just find it hard to care anymore.  Obviously not discounting those of you who *DO*, i'm just saying I personally *wish* I cared.
---
Or introduce an easier difficulty and make CMs worth repeating to make better use of content that is being created anyway? Maybe help introduce new people to raids and keep experienced players interested for longer?
---
That might be a crazy situation. It definitely hasn't helped other prominent and long running MMOs. :D
---
Old pick-up items in Orr
---
I mean, 12 of the final Fantasy raids each expansion are just circle room boss fights that take about 10 minutes once learned.
---
Think it's best to assign 5 outer people, and then assign a buddy for each outer person. Tell all the people not getting the pillar to stand a bit inside the boss's hitbox. Then you just gotta hope that there isn't complete chaos if a non-outer person gets the pillar.
---
I hope they're still doing the event when I get home from work in 2-3 hours! I missed it last time for the same reason
---
What in god's name makes you "pretty sure" Arenanet has 250 people working on raids  
---
what  
---
lmfao
---
&gt; they never said it was limited time only
---
I think if they only forgot to mention that it was time lmited it wouldn't be terrible because in the end they could still say that they never meant for it to stay indefinitely. But the actual situation now is far worse than that. They stated the exact opposite, which creates an issue of trust.
---
The price on these types of items almost always drops as:
---
1) People realize that the expected value is MUCH lower than the current market clearing price.
---
2) A significant percentage of the GW2 population who wants the achievement actually gets it and has no further use for them.
---
The current high price is almost always due to what I call "the impatience tax", where people are willing to pay higher prices to complete a collection right away. Think Sigils of Nullification, Skyscale food, et cetera.
---
Yeah, set them 6 hours apart, at least 4 events during weekday (preferably Monday or Friday) , 4 during weekend, and you should hit all the major play times.
---
it makes a difference as long as people get inside your range and you'll be able to share it to a couple of people. And it's not like the you need to minmax Pylon DPS, Qadim doesnt really have a huge damage check anyways
---
&gt; Anet, we need better communication.
---
What we need is competent people who inform themselves about what their fellow employees promised months ago.
---
Pretty sure he just created Glint, and didn't "make love". 
---
Since glint was his Champion, which was turned(?) against Kralkatorrik by the forgotten, as we know from the Path of fire story.
---
You can really only compare the raids released during the time that each company had a raid team though.
---
They clearly don't remember what they stated when they made the original posts. My guess is Byron Miller is sadly no longer with the company, and that the shake-up of staff caused that there were no devs around who would have stopped this change.
---
The forum post is still around. How about admitting the mistake and fixing it instead?
---
Sometimes they act like children trying to lie to their parents. It's pretty unprofessional.
---
I didn't say that they have 250 people working on raids
---
I never do hearts if I don't have to. Maybe the worst type of content in any RPG, they were why I didn't start playing the game for real till 2015 despite owning it since the beta weekends. Love the direction they went with Dragonfall and its HoT-esque meta, hoping they do more maps like that in LS5. Skyscale does look fun though, I'll get there!
---
That exchange which they said is not temporary should have never been removed in the first place. 
---
&gt;people have an actual reason to play these raids instead of doing W1 to W4 and exchanging insights to divinations.
---
If you did w5 before exchange got added, you got to exchange for 168 divinations. Everyone else that came after that, doesn't get that option. 
---
There was nothing about that exchange stopping new people from playing the new content, because they didn't have access to the exchange to begin with.
---
They should have used Littlefinger's teleporter instead.
---
Honestly, this never occurred to me. Perhaps Kralk had glint before he became an elder dragon, and then branded a pregnant Glint?
---
Yeah, definitely boss/encounter count would be better.
---
It'd also be good to distinguish things like 'easy' raids like the alliance raids in ffxiv, and 'extra hard raids' like ultimate in ffxiv. Unfortunately, my gw2 raiding is limited so I am not sure if there is anything comparable.
---
ANet has said you won't miss out on any achievements if you missed the first one (or any other) as long as you do it during one of them, so it should be the same achievements for all of the events.
---
It was made as part of a raid team feature answer, so...
---
Shoot, I guess anet doesn't like people with fulltime jobs, even though we're pretty much the only ones who buy gems.
---
There goes my chance at the new ring then
---
If they don't want people hoarding LIs, they could turn them into a currency and give it a cap of 300. There are far better solutions than spitting on player's faces (yet again).
---
So wait wdf? Sent just going to screw us over like that? At least give us a warning ahead of the patch I mean come on? I was waiting to see coalescence costs as I am sure everyone else was.
---
Now that's a constructive attitude...
---
Makes sense as I haven't raised much. That shit is hard and I hope you guys get some love for that.
---
If you white knight any harder you'll melt down your own eyes from the sheer luminosity.
---
Size of raids size of team in raids size of development team. Raid content paired with other content. We dont need more raids unless they give us something to do with the li and ld
---
Why not just remove tiers altogether? Just use the same materials across the board with different quantities?
---
BRYON OUTDATED  RAIDS OVERRATED  TOO LONG YOU WAITED  YOUR LI ARE PRESERVATED
---
Fortunately your white knighting truly is limitless.
---
Two things. 
---
1. This person is toxic, don't take it to heart since they're the gunk that needs to be scraped off of GW2's boot.
---
2. It is very helpful to others if you waypoint once you die completally. This way there isn't a dps loss on the boss, it keeps it from scaling higher than the living can manage because of the dead, and you still get credit since you at least participated some in the killing of the boss. 
---
So yeah, don't worry about the weirdo. Most people aren't so toxic when they teach people
---
True, although the question still stands, why do lower level players get more valuable drops than higher level players?
---
It'd be nice if they added some mystic forge or crafting demotion recipes. Also, they already had a source of lower level mats in high level zones with LS3's magic-infused hide, cloth, and metal (or whatever they were called), as well as the recent weekly event boxes, so it'd be nice if there were more sources like that.
---
I completely agree!  The reason I mentioned it is because having that makes enabling a "buy what you need" system easy to implement.
---
As the original poster of the forum thread pointing this out, I'm honestly quite disappointed by the lack of communication on this matter. I'm pretty sure it's an honest mistake and Anet did not mean to mislead us, but they have screwed over a lot of us with this change.  
---
I will just add that I don't have nearly as much time to raid as I've had when only Insights were in the game, so this will mean all my previous raiding was practically for naught and I will have to wait literal months for the legendary ring, unless they do something about this.  
---
On a related note - with the unlimited exchange of Divinations into Insights, they bascially invented a useless currency, for which they implicitly state they will have no further use.
---
Well I’ve just recently started spending money again. If this is not corrected soon, I’m not going to continue spending.
---
It's all a secret plan to avoid people complaining about the terribly ugly effect.
---
If they don't have it, they won't compla- Oh shit, the forums are burning!
---
It's fun! Good rewards and fun mechanics, the community can be harsh at times but there are training runs and training guilds for people trying to make first experiences!
---
I do, but that doesn't mean it can't be different.  Microsoft used to sell Microsoft points that essentially worked the same.  They've since moved away from that.
---
&gt; They want to give players a reason to play new content.
---
If you need shitty timegates to make your content interesting, maybe it wasn't interesting in the first place.
---
Just feeding the treadmill of gem/Gold conversion. :)
---
I just save any leftover gems for other convenience items. I only convert Gold to Gems when sales happen and I end up with weird numbers, or am &lt; 400 gems short for something. My job pays me more per hour than I am capable of farming/flipping. A cost/benefit analysis n all that
---
That would be nice, though it would also require a rework of the whole crafting system. They did that for sigils and runes, but I doubt it'd happen in that way for the rest.
---
&gt;Pretty sure that both GW2 and FFXIV teams have around 250 people
---
...is what you said, and...  
---
&gt; ESO and FFXIV raid teams are huge and they have the resources to pull it  off. Arenanet has only a handful of people working on raids and the  studio size is way smaller 
---
...is what you were responding to.
---
They can ask for some extra magnetite shards or gaeting crystals if participation is what they worry about.
---
Take your disgusting attitude and gtfo of here.   
---
It's shit like this that stop devs talking full stop.
---
Same, if the only way I can do to punish this behaviour is not to spend money in the game I will do it.
---
I got 2 Tricolor Keys. Most of the rest was random junk and mats/trophies.
---
They don't even play their own fucking game. No one who has raided at least once would have pushed this stupid change.
---
The wiki lists which enemies drop which loot, for example [totems](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Totem#Dropped_by) they drop from 4 types of enemies
---
If I was implying that the first "team" was a boss team, then I would have contradicted myself by saying that the FFXIV boss team was both 250 people, and less than 10 people.
---
I thought it was obvious contextually, that I was saying that they have equivalent size teams working on the game as a whole, and the FFXIV raid team isn't huge at less than 10 people.
---
What? What’s wrong with his statement you are quoting? I am a player who clear wing 5 almost every week from release to wing 6. I never used that exchange even though it was available because I was waiting to see coalescence.
---
Now the new wing is out and I still have reasons to play it (it’s new challenging and there are new rewards), that’s what he’s saying. He’s not referring to new players at all.
---
My fans go crazy when I play runescape
---
There is the standard difficulty and then some bosses have challenge modes that increase the difficulty. The problem with the implementation of this in Guild Wars 2 is that challenge modes have little reason to be done more than once, unlike the harder versions in other MMOs.
---
I took the time to make a few additional versions of this data, out of boredom.
---
[All Data](https://i.gyazo.com/0424e299f09b41a05364302bb4f243ed.png) - This one shows the same data as the one OP posted here on Reddit, just with the formatting I am using for my quickly organized Google Sheets.
---
[No Alliance Raids](https://i.gyazo.com/3f38c0a331d1320f1cab07d0dbfa6ebb.png) - This one removes the FFXIV Alliance Raids from the count for that game, as /u/nalthien somewhat suggested. This means the chart is only showing the standard sized raids for each game (8-12, accordingly.)
---
["Fair" Timespan](https://i.gyazo.com/bbcdf0170f9549b5e0353d89d54a883e.png) - All standard sized raids from each game, but only since the release of the latest game (ESO.) So, this shows only raids released after 5/23/2014 across each of the game.
---
So for the sake of consistency, take the shortest duration since raids were implemented. GW2 since September 2015. In the span of 4 years (of which we are currently 3 months shy of being and I am pretty sure we aren't getting another wing in that much time) since implementation of that mode:
---
GW2 in 4 years has gotten 7 wings
---
ESO in 4 years has gotten 6 wings
---
FFXIV in 4 years has gotten 10 wings.
---
Also, I feel a line graph is not the right type of graph to represent this since the point the OP is trying to make is a quantity total rather than an evolution/progression.
---
Nah. They promised us that there is no timelimit. 
---
Fuck the "Grace period"! Just let us have both options.
---
LI to LD and LD to LI
---
And now I fully expect to see this in the future
---
Until they implement dye channels on starfishes.
---
Then the revolution will truly begin.
---
Can we see a graph for WvW releases also?
---
The same amount as mithril ingots from the last time, so around 7,000 volatile magic.
---
Ridiculously cheap, so you better get it quick.
---
Doesn't mean they'll abandon GW2 which they keep improving upon. GW2 has much more replayability than the first game. Not that the first game didn't have any. But once you did everything in the first game, that was it. There wasn't much else to do besides help other people assuming there is anyone that needs it. The other day when I logged in, there were zero players in LA and fewer than 15 in pre-searing (most level 20s just AFKing). It's also a lot harder to find people to play with and make friends given that it's mostly instanced so it's really a bad comparison here as a lot of people actually playing the game are probably in a mission or something.
---
There's still more than enough players in GW2 for Anet to bother supporting it. When world bosses stop dying, then it's probably safe to assume they're already working on GW3. And that probably won't happen for at least another year or so.
---
Interesting hill to die on.
---
I thought the post's context was incredibly clear and readily apparent.
---
That's a good point. I imagine it's an oversight. Hope that, if they do the rift thing in the future, they fix it. Otherwise, I'll just pretend it takes place before Dragonfall i guess?
---
They did say that PvP / WvW are getting new armors soon, it could possibly be the last 2 trinkets
---
IMHO it should have been the same glyph as the previous tool. I'd buy the shit out of a pack with 3 skyskale tools (2700 gems ?) all with the aoe gathering glyph.
---
Thanks! The Mammoth was certainly my basis for the Dolyak idea, but I chose to build on it with more GW2-ish finesse in order to not make people spit at me for mentioning an idea from another MMO. I did very much enjoy the mammoth feature in WoW while it was relevant.
---
I mean, if I was ArenaNet, I would. But alas...
---
*Players who spent more than 100 gold last time:*
---
This has been the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals, maybe ever.
---
That's a long video for just saying "money".
---
This is good fashion wars. Meta Wars is just how shiny you can be. . .
---
I got a tricolor key too! I think I'm going to add it to my hoard of items I keep for "memories."
---
Because fuck you, that's why.
---
To be fair, the set of PoF raids should have unlocked *a full set of trinkets*, so 1 amulet, 2 rings, and 2 accessories.
---
We went down from 18 legendary armor pieces, with 36 precursor pieces for a total of 54 armor pieces with their own unique skins, to just 1 legendary ring. It's pathetic.
---
Some look amazing with their fancy shiny colors though!
---
Of the goddamn griffon? Do you even read what you're replying at, or you just fanboy mindlessly?
---
Not just realms from other gods, but more stuff like what we saw in Jahai in the rifts.
---
Then don't make up excuses for them, you're doing no one a favor here.
---
please no, not everyone is a fan of insect wings. If anything there should be an option to disable it.
---
I think the only people happy about it are Raid Sellers, because Coalescene being part of the Aurora Open World PvE chain is gonna spike their sales big time.
---
All those talents synergize with the various engineering kits. Flamethrower is an awesome way to focus your leveling build if you're lazy and just want to do it easily. Juggernaut gives stability which makes a lot of mobs far less annoying. All damage stats help in a meaningful way so you can just wear whatever gear you like.
---
If you're struggling to keep your health, back pedal or circle while firing and you will avoid most high damage attacks. Healing turret is generally better to drop and pick up after the health boost and regen land, it allows you to keep moving freely and from my observation I think it's actually more healing output, never tested it though.
---
The downside to leveling as flamethrower mainly is that it's generally slower than piano engineer, and you aren't training yourself to get used to quick kit dancing for end game.
---
Wasn't this already communicated when Ld was added.
---
What people perceive and what things are do not always align.  
---
When people kept thinking the Sun rotated around Earth, it didn't matter how many people believed that, it was wrong.
---
As far as we can tell, GW2 determines who can attack who with two settings:
---
* Teams
---
 * Each map has teams, and every creature belongs to a team. Players appear to have 1 'default' player team, but it's not that rare for events, renown hearts and other scripted behaviors to change teams. 
---
 * Every team has a setting for every other team, that indicates how they can interact with that other team. So far we've only seen 3 settings: 
---
      * The hostile setting allows a team to attack another team.
---
      * The neutral setting prevents both attacking and supporting. Not even reviving will be possible. 
---
      * The ally setting allows healing, giving boons and other support.
---
 * The setting doesn't go both ways. Setting a team to see another as enemy won't make the other team see as enemy back, the other team has to be set too. So it's possible to set Team A to see team B as an ally, and team B to see team A as an enemy. We saw this happening when they forgot to properly set the tags for the team you are put in in Silverwastes when you bribe the bandit champion to enter the bandit camp. The bandit team was set to see that temporary team as neutral, but the player team was set to see it as enemy. And so players could kill players who bribed the bandit to enter the camp. 
---
 * In WvW we can see there's at least 8 teams: The default PvE palyer team (players were only put in this team during the WvW peace incident). 1 player team for each color. At least 1 NPC team for each color that sees the player team as ally, and 1 or more 'wildlife' teams.
---
 * They use this team switching a lot even if one doesn't notice. This is how they can easily make you hostile to karka hatchlings in the Southsun guild race, while players still see them as neutral. If you transform into a wolf for the harathi race while the giant in doing its event, you can see the wolf racer team has been set to see Fen as hostile, and Fen will attack the wolf runners too.
---
* Aggression.
---
 * Every creature has an aggression table, and every creature they attack or that is attacked by them will be there. It appears that even players have it. Hostile actions give you aggression, the more aggression you have on an NPC's table, the more likely they are to attack you.
---
 * This is what makes hostile creatures change between red and yellow names. It appears that teams can have a default aggression towards another team, making them attack on sight, and we see those as having red names. Those with no default aggression as seen as yellow names. But this setting is separate from the Ally/neutral/enemy setting. 
---
 * Taunt appears to interact with this setting, and apparently even players have it, making the target temporarily lose all aggression towards anything but the target. This even makes players see other enemies with yellow names.
---
 * At the end of some events, the aggression can be forcefully dropped to 0 to the enemies that run away to show they lost their will to fight. They didn't do this very often, tho. Probably not everyone had the same idea, as the maps and events are done by different people. 
---
 * I have no idea if it's possible to gain aggression towards allies and neutral creatures. Considering some buggy behaviors we've seen over the years, it may be possible. Maye if the team of creature our team is set to see as neutral is set to see our team as enemies. 
---
 * Critters with white names appear to have some sort of "Passive" setting that will make them not attack even if you attack them. Maybe it's negative aggression? Or an unique effect or flag? Maybe they have no skills? I could not find a way to test that. But it's clear they are also enemies, since a few in some instances have enough HP to  can actually survive an attack and some may even attack back after a bit, if they have skills to attack. 
---
 * I suspect aggression is also what's used to determine if you are in combat. You likely leave combat when both your aggression table is empty and you are no longer in anyone's aggression table anymore, as aggression goes down over time if no additional hostile actions are done. 
---
Based on those two settings, we can't call yellow named enemies "neutral" because our team see them as enemies and their team sees us as enemies. And when can't call neutral NPCs "allies" because we can't heal them and they can't heal us, they are neutral.  
---
So it isn't simply "Enemy, neutral, ally", it's a combination of these two settings that get us this: 
---
 * Passive
---
 * 0 aggro
---
 * Aggro
---
* Neutral
---
* Ally
---
It's still 3 things "enemy, neutral and ally", yes, but "enemy" has 3 colors (white, yellow and red), while "ally" and "neutral" share Green.  
---
That makes things a bit confusing, and it would have been nice if they had given ally and neutral NPCs different colors, so you can know which ones are actual allies you can heal, but unfortunately they didn't and we can't tell allies from neutral NPCs just by looking, and that makes it harder to see how there's a difference.  
---
Them having the same color also makes people confuse them and think they are both the same thing, when they are two different settings. 
---
People is used to simple settings, and how things work in other games, and so they kind of keep that mentality across games even if things do not work the same.  Kind of like how some people call crafting disciples "professions", professions "classes", thieves "assassins" and rangers "hunters" out of custom.  
---
That isn't always a problem, but when you don't call things by their name, you get confusion and people making wrong assumptions, like that guy who though warthogs where "neutral" because they had yellow names, and how hit by them because yellow names are actually "enemies with 0 aggro".
---
You are right! I do like shiny. I use Chaos gloves on all my toons.. just like in GW1. But that's as shiny ball of light I will go. I prefer the detail..
---
Sure, line 42.
---
Change this: $toCheckPath = "$GW2Path\bin64\$toCheck.dll"
---
To this: $toCheckPath = "$GW2Path\$toCheck.dll"
---
When you have 150 LD than you have enough for the ring.
---
Well the reason is quite simple. They wanted to give the LD for the wing  5 people. By now people who didn't really got the LI from wing 5 would just exchange them not really playing the new wings for the ring.. Thats quite a fair reasoning behind it. But if you really are a raider I guess you don't care because you have more than enough LD with no use...
---
How long will this last?
---
How much Volatile Magic are we talking about?
---
The graphic makes no sense. I have to be curves or stairs, but not that senseless mix.
---
Honestly it's a bit annoying, but I don't really mind that much... just hold on to your extra gems for next time so you don't need to buy as many the next time... or convert to gold for instant benefit.
---
I ended up getting back into FFXIV because of GW2's terrible performance.
---
I have an old laptop and GW2 averaged a whole 8 FPS. FFXIV averages 20. The CPU is a C2D dual-core though, so it's nothing amazing.
---
I can pick the off but i still have to play to my full extend of skill to do it as i will pull more for sure, meanwhile in wow i pulled 10 mobs at max level and spam aoe and never go below 80% HP, this games open world is way, way harder than other MMO's, try to solo a HOT HP on thief like.
---
I don't generally buy gems with cash. I convert gold  when sales are *not* happening to ensure a better exchange rate and then spend them. If I'm short a little when a sale hits, I might pay cash for a small amount.
---
I was waiting to see what they might be used for...
---
Lmao if you really think this sub is bad, you must not have seen OSRS's subreddit. I'm pretty confident nothing tops that for lack-of rule enforcement and shitposts.
---
I never said that. What I meant was they still would have to make changes for the community at large
---
Ive never been oneshot in WoW like that, nothing in WoW reaquires reaction and skill like a power mesmer spike comming your way. I played 1 other MMO besides that.
---
Wow just wow, anets incompetence at communication knows no bounds.
---
OP said they collected 150+ LD **before** they were a thing, meaning the 150+ LD they are speaking of are actually LI that could have been converted into LD.
---
In case somebody's wondering. The event is still up. 50%
---
I am not so sure. I could have bought w7 but only if I was going to get the LD that I needed with the exchange. Now I really don't a reason to buy it.
---
The ultimate gamble...
---
Don't you have heavy animation locking? Does it have anything like stunbreaking and then dodging a power mesmer spike or else you die?
---
I tried playing GW2 recently on an ancient C2D laptop (T9600); it averages about 8 FPS at lowest settings. FFXIV averages 20 FPS, and WoW (BFA) averages 30; both with a mix of low and high settings.
---
&gt; or the fact that coalescence costs so much more than the other 2 trinkets 
---
While also giving less stats than accessories.
---
Yeah I got into the room with the panels, I didn't attempt the poison gas challenge though.
---
Yep
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c03rgw/fun_visual_glitches_in_wing_7_after_clear/
---
Anet tend to be very conservative with their communication, nothing is communicated until its signed off by Senior Management.
---
Same. I'm not going to convert 168 LI&gt;LD only to find out the only use is for the ring and it only needs 100. This was handled very unprofessionally.
---
Ah. Tyty!
---
It seems to me that Anet is targeting adjusting reward structures  where players can aim the value themselves through in-game behavior.  Theoretically these changes should make the various faucets of supply more predictable from their wholistic perspective of the economy.
---
Ex 1: Multi-loot maps (AB, GH, etc)
---
Ex 2: Champion cap to that one event in istan
---
Ex 3: Higher value from Unid gear by maximizing magic find before opening them
---
Ex 4: This change indirectly reducing the faucet on low tier mats and increasing the faucet on higher tier mats. 
---
Whether or not I agree with all of these changes being a good thing is moot.  It does look like a trend to me though.
---
Eli5?
---
It's very instructive.
---
which is fine for some people, they dont like flashy skins
---
It has some draw effect but its very subtle.
---
I don’t mean the LD conversion part... 
---
I just meant that there’s probably, definitely, open world players who were happy enough with Aurora (and Vision), and never cared if they got a raid legendary skin, but now that it’s directly tied into their other two, they gosta have it.
---
as a general rule, if mixing armor you likely won't want to mix more than two stat types. Also, make sure that you're running with armor that boosts exactly what you want to do. In all cases, there will be a trade-off, and you never want to be both condi and power as you will always end up just being subpar at both. Also, make sure you're not running condi weapons on a power build and vice-versa, since that'll end up being nearly useless.
---
that's all the advice I have at the time I guess, if you have questions about any of that just ask.
---
Well two people have said it has taken a long time now and also I had been a week with no response back now... You don't think that's a little ridiculous to recover an account from a customer service perspective?
---
You make a valid point, this process would not be easy or cheap, but I feel like if they can manage to pull it off, they should. Especially since as time goes on, the game will become increasingly incompatible with newer rigs, and interest in the game will thus decline as a result for that reason.
---
I'd love to see one with boss encounters instead of # of instances, also include FFXIV ultimate raids, which for some reason OP excluded.
---
Best buy still sells 2000 gem cards for $25
---
Why would you want to see an empty graph?
---
They're all the same because they ARE all the same. They "evolve" with eachother.
---
&gt; Extra content created from currently existing content (like a Bestiary in which you hunt/collect these beasts for information, a Library for collecting books and other readable items, in a similar vein to how they released the entire novelty collectionable aspect)
---
Although I would love seeing bestiary in GW2 (after playing ARK I love games with bestiary) I don't think they would do that. There are so many creatures in GW2 that I don't know how they could do that.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Projects/Shared_Model_Project
---
This link shows how many creatures are there. Even if they just simplified it to species only (so Drakes) instead of many subspecies like Salamander Drake,  Rock Drake, Ice Drake, River Drake, etc it would  take a lot work to do since there are plenty of species. 
---
Anet is also known for releasing something and then not updating it. After it's initial release it would not be updated to newest creatures/species in future.
---
Still, I hope they will release bestiary. Along with creature statues/trophies for Guild Hall and Player Housing!
---
It's has been too often that CS leads had to come forward to remind us that we need to follow the proper steps when we submit a ticket, as it will otherwise take much longer to resolve.
---
I don't have all too much trust in the average mmo gamer, especially not when they're all anxious because they suddenly can't play the game and thus send a rushed and crappy ticket which leaves the support guy facing it rather powerless.
---
Hell, Dornsinger himself even answered them here, on reddit! This isn't even an official forum, they literally went beyond their duties to cater to this player. And you insult them...
---
Same, when they stated that there was no time limit. The best option was to wait to see the ring, then discover how many LD were needed and then change them if you wanted. I feel that we have been punished just for trusting anet.
---
&gt;Those are Expansions, They expand the game. DLC sounds like some additional character or a new map or something.
---
Exactly. Living Story episodes are a lot like traditional DLC, while expansions are expansions.   
---
Living Story 2 contains "DLC" for the core game.  
---
Living Story 3 contains "DLC" for the Heart of Thorns expansion.
---
Living Story 4 contains "DLC" for the Path of Fire expansion
---
Also, if you log in once while a living story episode ("DLC") is live, you get it for free.
---
Neither do your characters.
---
Guys, I don't think he's complaining about the amount of groups. I know that I got the impression that he actually just wants raids separated by wing, like fractals are separated by the 4 tiers. (Or maybe this is just what I want and am projecting onto this post)
---
Read the flavor text associated with all of the ring. Then imagine completing those collections getting all those items and even just looking at the thumbnail of the precursor and legendary. Then putting the ring on and seeing pink balls around you. Excuses like these are what the Anet devs are going to be saying or would be if they interacted with the community on a critical basis at all. It’s an excuse for lazy design and poor resource allocation. There is no reason they cannot evolve with each other and still have their own effects. Even if they are going to evolve with each other and not be unique they shouldn’t have individual costs of a full legendary. No one expected the second accessory to come out so soon they could’ve really easily use the same resources they did to develop that second accessory in order to develop the ring. And people are going to say that oh well it’s different teams working on different things but if that were true then they wouldn’t evolve with each other in the first place and the effects of each of them wouldn’t be so closely tied to each other. Clearly the teams had to work together on this and clearly that was a mistake.
---
Welp... it makes rich gold and copper (sorta) veins a little more worth, at least. And soft and hard wood are a decent boost.
---
Totally worth 1k gems. (I'll wait til its in the BLC and on TP)
---
I don't own any of them so I don't have a horse in this race but the idea that the three are identical just don't indicate great design choices to me. Wouldn't it make more sense for each individual effect to be indicative of what the incremental effect is? We don't even have an effect / infusion wardrobe so people that want just the legendary trinkets without the effect are out of luck
---
time to upgrade
---
As someone who does raid, and has a guild who I've checked with, nobody felt affected by this and everyone knew it was going away eventually, this is massively overblown and that's a lot coming from me lol
---
why use supersampling? isn't there UI scaling options now?
---
The expansions are only accessible by lvl 80 characters, and it's a terrible idea to boost to 80 if you're new to the game. I would very VERY highly recommend playing f2p to 80 first. Also, don't sell anything you can salvage, or anything you get by salvaging, to a vendor. When you buy an expansion you'll get access to the trading post, which buys those things for much, much, much more. 
---
Also, all items you can sell to a vendor will tell you their value. That value is almost always a lie. To find the true value of an item, right click it and see for how much it sells for on the Trading Post.
---
Yeah, and all world bosses should each have unique ascended armor drops, because Tequatl have one. /s
---
Thanks you are the man!
---
what about everyone who doesn't do raids immediately, or are new to the game?
---
Well, if you can heal you'll be healing a lot of people, so it might be right. If you're a running a healer build I'd imagine you're healing would be higher than your dps, right?
---
I have never raided in gw2 before, can someone explain to me what this means and why people are infuriated by it?
---
My computer runs every other game on the highest settings, I dont think the problem is there
---
Thats not a bit of dps, thats a lot of dps. On top of that, basi stack with the number of people that are with you. It does 150 per person with max 5 person, so at best you get 300 cc out of it which is less than a third of what scourge brings
---
"I bought your game 2 years ago so, you need to listen to my wishes till the end of the game life. I pAy FoR yOuR jOb."
---
Hell nah.
---
Crisper image. Supersampling increases the amount of virtual pixels textures have, it isn't to adjust UI scale.
---
I also played w5 for months before LD were released. After w6 I almost left raids so I have very few LD and a lot of LI which I got with W5 ( and I never exchanged), so it is not fair that now I can't craft the ring. I don't want to play again w5 to get LD when I played for months. Therefore I think they should add the exchange again forever or if not as you say, at least give us a grace period to make the exchange.
---
Do the jumping puzzle that starts at the underground Boat to get there.
---
Do the jumping puzzle, retrospective runaround.
---
&gt;clearly that was a mistake.
---
Because you don't like it.
---
Sure it would be nice if they have individual effects. There are plenty of things that would be nice. It would be nice for eternity to have a uniqe skin. It would be nice for the wvw and pvp legendary armor to not be the same skin as the precusor with slapped on effects. It would be nice to have dyable backpacks. It would be nice to have more content. It would be nice to have capes.
---
All of that costs resources and time. Theres enough to do, and frankly i think this is pretty damn low on the list of important updates.
---
You can't deal damage to Treasure Mushrooms without mastery. Period. They evade your attacks. Only way to tag them is via attacks of other players hitting Mushroom created from your combo field, or empowered by your abilities.
---
I'm getting envoy armor vibes. Dont get your hopes too high.
---
When raid wing 5 was released, it original gave out Legendary Insight instead of the newer Legendary Divination. After ArenaNet switched the Path of Fire wings to use Legendary Divination, they allowed players to exchange upto 168 LI for LD to compensate for the time payers could have been acquiring LD.
---
originally, there wasn't going to be a cutoff point, but it seems Anet changed their mind...
---
As far as I'm aware all 3 of the games have roughly the same average bosses per "raid", FF is probably ahead of the curve a bit.
---
If we're just counting 14's harder 8-man raids its technically 12 raids. (3 from coil, 1 from coil savage, 3 from alexander, 3 from omega, and 2 from ultimates) Each of which has 4 bosses except the ultimates, adding up to 42 bosses. Alexander and Omega have difficulty options like WoW raids (an easy "LFR" version, and a more difficult version), everything past coil does not have trash mobs in the savage versions.
---
(As a technical note, the third fight of coil is not counted as its trash and for the purposes of this I \*am\* counting the second fight of alexander as a boss. It is however basically just a trash rush so subtract 1 if you want)
---
Just the easier 24-mans adds up to 9 raids. Each of these also tends to have 4 bosses, adding up to 36 bosses. These do not have difficulty options.
---
If we wanted to be pedantic and count each collection as a singular raid then its just 2 raids per expansion (1 8-man, 1 24-man), so collectively it'd be 6 raids, 1 special savage raid, and 2 ultimates. With collectively the same boss count as before.
---
As a note, coil savage and ultimates aren't shown on the chart. If I have mathed incorrectly someone can let me know.
---
Someone with more knowledge of ESO/GW2 boss counts and raid design would have to provide details for that, I'm just running on the assumption of random old tidbits suggesting anywhere from 2-5 bosses usually leaning towards 3.
---

After ArenaNet switched the Path of Fire wings to use Legendary Divination, they allowed players to exchange upto 168 LI for LD to compensate for the time payers could have been acquiring LD. (You needed to have completed at least one wing 5 encounter for this option to be available)
---
It’s not an update?? It’s a final product that they used resources to create. Resources that they could have used to do it well in the first place. I promise you the actual devs don’t think this is quality design. Anyone can see reusing the same effect across three legendary items is lazy design, and the devs themselves know that whether they admit it or not.
---
Do you prefer the current system?
---
Yes, I seem to recall this as well.
---
You are correct. Byron has left a couple of weeks ago :(
---
But what if I have my armors and just want to exhange for the ring eh? WHY NOT GIVE US BOTH OPTIONS EH?

You can still jump inside of Garrision and Hills (outer+innerwall) with Warclaw and Engineer. It might fit here because my original post got instant deleted...

Every single time  I start thinking about coming back to the game, something like this happens and reminds me why i stopped playing
---
And since Glint was the only known and interacting dragon at the time(that was not branded), she couldn’t have reproduced with anyone else to create Aurene.
---
I personally would love to see a "re-mastered" version of GW2 (and GW1, for that matter) but it's a tough call to make. It requires all the resources of designing a whole new game, but with even more testing since you have to make sure that everything not only works, but *works exactly like it did before*.
---
Add on to that the fact that you don't recover your development costs with launch sales (because it's not a new game with new content) and things start to look pretty grim.
---
That's not to say it's impossible; there might be some relatively low hanging fruit in terms of updates (i.e. things still difficult and technical, but that don't require a total overhaul of the engine). I personally hope there are :)
---
Not sure why that is a bug fix
---
Dude.  Everyone here understands perfectly what you're saying.  The problem is not that you're being unclear, so you can stop continually making longer and longer posts.  The problem is that you are calling someone out for using the wrong terminology, when you're the one defining things in a manner that the rest of the community does not.
---

---
cpl notes, there is a 5 boss raid in second coil, but otherwise it's groups of 4's. Also, I'd say that Alex Normal and Omega Normal are closer to WoW's normal raids, and the alliance raids are closer to WoW's LFR. There is no equivalent for WoW's heroic in FFXIV though.
---
I'm more familiar with FFXIV raids than I am with either WoW or GW2. GW2, I've only been in to a few bosses.
