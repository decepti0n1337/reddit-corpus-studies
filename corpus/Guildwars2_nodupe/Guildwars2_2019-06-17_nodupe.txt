This is worth a chuckle but at the same time... it saddens me they obviously had more planned but couldn't finish it all on time. They've done this before, with Malyck?
---
---
---
Really? Never got to see that place by myself, thanks for the heads up!
---

---
(Also please take some more screenshots in case it gets blocked again any soon)
---
....that's just... Yeah. Let's nerf EVERYTHING in game, so 0.00001% can play it. Seems good choice.
---
Hope decision like this will stay as one single time.
---
&gt;There is no "now what?".
---
Yes there is, my experience is different from yours and no less valid.
---
&gt;I never said that arcdps is always bad or can't be good. Ofcourse it has two sides. 
---
Your wording says otherwise.  The word choice used really implies that you have a dislike for DPS meters.
---
&gt;And there are groups getting destroyed, people getting kicked or leaving because or arcdps.  It's a fact no matter how much excuses you bring of how situation XY could be there even without arcdps or how you personally use it. 
---
All because now, they can't hide how bad they are, how terrible their character build is put together, and how poorly they do mechanics.  It's all written out for anyone using the program and is even easier to see now.  What I'm saying is, in this scenario, ArcDPS wouldn't matter.  If you read OP's replies throughout this thread, the person who left was downing a lot, failing mechanics, and not performing a rotation.  You don't need ArcDPS to see that.  ArcDPS was just the person's excuse to leave the party because now they *know* they can't get away with their garbage.
---
&gt;There are people getting kicked which wouldn't be the case without arcdps. You can't deny that.
---
Just like there were people being kicked for playing the "wrong" class back in the day.  Today, DPS meters and logs allow people to review evidence and make a better judgement on who to kick instead of just an assumption based on what's popular.  You're blaming a tool here for doing its job and logging performance.  That's akin to someone blaming the hammer for hitting their finger when putting in a nail instead of their poor aim.
---
Dps checks.... 10% Dhuum, 10% Deimos and Statues at W5 says hello and wanna to know your location
---
Because the only dps check in W1 is to actually skip mechanics? Like updraft, or 2 out of 4 canons on Sabetha, or needs to move on VG before 33%?
---
Even better, we can make something similar and put it on the wiki, perhaps ultimately on [Personal story](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Personal_story)... but for now please find a test version here:

I beg you to do daily Charged Quartz Crystals! I won’t tell you why for the sake of spoiling anything, but you’ll need a good 20ish of them to save you some hassle along the way, or you could spend gold if you have the coin for it!
---
I’m good! I had almost 50 charge quarts and at least 200 of each map currency before I started :D
---
I love those wings so much!
---
This is such pretty art!
---
Seconding (though I don't remember the elder dragon part, but I believe it.)
---
I very much remember the devs saying these this.
---
Hey, who found my game footage?!
---
Don't bother, just get the cheapo 20 slot fractal bags
---
I believe the asura already do
---
Personal story chapters unlock every 10 levels, but each chapter only has enough XP to carry you through about 4-5 levels. You fill the rest by jumping around all the other maps that are available for your level. There are several start zones, then several 15-25 areas, several 25-35, etc.
---
the charr do when you rp walk with them. asura do too
---
&gt;But you don’t have to play meta in raids.
---
Now I’m going to stop you right there. I get the idea behind that statement and for the most part I agree with it. I also agree that these ”9999+ killproofs” LFG’s are ridiculous. And no group has to perform on the same level as say discretize where a boss dies in 60 seconds.
---
***But*** when you have a group activity, *trust in the meta*. I can’t count how many whipes I’ve experienced in raids and fractals because someone decided that Fun&gt;Meta. I can’t count how many times a battle should have gone quicker because one person decided to contribute less to the group because Fun&gt;Meta.
---
I’m not gonna shit on anyone who plays PvE with their own build. I’m not gonna shit on those who changes a trait or two from the meta builds that exist out there. But if you’re underperforming **hard** because you refuse to use a meta build *and* you’re doing a group activity, you can kindly fuck off. Because this is a big factor to why elitism exist. I’ve run with pugs in both raids and CM’s and the more I do the more I realise why there is an elitism trend in the LFG. I’m talking condi reapers getting as much as 2,5k DPS at their peak. If you’re not prepared to adapt to the meta at all, then you’re making everyones experience worse —&gt; People raise the standards —&gt; Elitism is created.
---
I also think the main problem is that the is no way for the general player to LEARN how to be a good player if they don't try to improve by themselves, but it kinda fall back to the early statement where every time Anet make something a bit more challenging a big mass scream about it and then it is nerfed. 
---
ex: the map you get the beetle mount (don't remember the name) it had a champion that at some point it uses a reflect shield, and people didn't stop AA, so a big part of the players went down. They asked to nerf and then it was nerfed so now you can AA it to death. 
---
(mess up English, I try)
---
[removed]
---
perhaps the team from the 2nd game was a premade and didn't want a random joining their party? 
---
i'm a bit confused though, because you don't get dishonor if you leave after a match is over. did you join their party after the match and que for another before leaving?
---
Man..I haven't played that game in years
---
just think about the UI on their screen, they may not be ignoring you, just not aware of you
---
My experience with large events is that once everything is done there will always be people rezzing others, but right now it could potentially be because of the world boss event going on, people will clear inventory and go to the next area without paying attention to anything else.  Loot blinds people sometimes.
---
I tried climbing with skyscale but couldn't find a way around the invisible wall. I guess OP started from a different vantage point and flew over the invisible wall.
---
i think the wizards tower is manned by a rogue djinn. i think the inside will be a raid with secrets of ley energy. the wizards tower is like this games version of attack on titan's basement, which season3 just got into ;))
---
This. So much this for me. I have seen in Shatterer, people staying dead almost whole fight refusing to teleport and refusing to read map chat. Yeah, I am petty. 
---
Also, OP, If you are doing Hard World Bosses, it coincides with other world boss. After HWB, If they can swap over to WB quickly they can mine the node there as well. (or wise versa if they get into right instance). In those cases, if you are dead, just wp out and avoid the bother.
---
Even if I don't agree 1:1 with every interpretation of norn here, the fact is it's literally *300% better than the nothing we have in game*.
---
You can definitely explain norn becoming less independent as "norn society changed when they moved south because the unified desire to destroy Jormag and return home changed them" and/or that norn cultural outlook now makes steadings/villages more common because "what better way to prove you are *the best* as a craftsman, tradesman, labourer etc than to prove in front of people every day that fact?" Norn being less separate can definitely be made to make sense in their current story, that every single norn still desires to prove their greatness/be raised to live eternal in the songs of their people and that it's the norn individual desire to prove themselves that makes their towns so great.
---
(I'm also inclined to believe that norn &amp; charity can/do exist side by side but depends on the people in a specific place, because you can definitely be remembered for being a great altruist who used their skill and might to protect and help others.)
---
That fact is... literally *nothing norn happens in game*. No interpretations of their lore, who they are, who they were or who they will be. Just "ope arrow in the tooth happened!" and nothing after that. It's fucking shit.
---
yeah people don't usually click the button to join the team's party without communicating first. they probably didn't notice until it was too late or something.
---
unranked is where i learned the basics through trial and error and nobody really gave me shit for it or anything. if you leave a match, cheat, afk, disconnect, etc... you will earn a stack of dishonor and the more often you do the worse the penalty will be. (i believe cheating/win-trading can result in a permanent dishonor)
---
Typo is the prime evil of the programming.
---
Maybe unpopular, but I *really* miss when the stakes were a little bit smaller and personal. "Dragon's Watch" was more a guild when I was literally the Boss and their 5-6 friends roaming Tyria with a good mix of "big damn heroes" and "a small group doing what they can to exist/aid in a world much bigger than them."
---
We're literally never going to meet the rest of Jory's family or deal with any of her stuff, we're never gonna find out what happened to Kas' brother etc and I've just accepted that. Our friends are only our friends when Anet wants to hurt them for Drama™ or advance the plot and it's really upsetting.
---
I'm so glad this got archived.
---
No, the bandit weapon skins can be bought in wvw
---
I just don't get why they don't at least make the norn racial appearances a novelty mini-collection for norn characters. If you're not going to let racial skills be viable, at the very least let us use them as cosmetics.
---
Who needs proper swordplay when you can just confuse the hell out of your opponent with clones and stuff.
---
Mesmers aren't a top DPS class for a reason...
---
No, this always happens in small battles in open world. I will always WP if the fight isn't near the end. For example, some random champion troll and then there will just be 5 people besides me and I always get downed at the end of the battle because I get too ambitious and try to end the fight and then they will just leave me dead lol. Maybe I'm just unlucky but this happens to me all the time in open world, not on the world bosses though- I always get revived during those thankfully. Sometimes I'll also just die while leveling a character and many people will run past me when the baddies already are away from me, but I understand that they don't want to stop and revive- at least it makes sense
---
Dont assume you should always be ressed, if theres a waypoint near then just revive because it's just as fast and you dont waste other peoples time because you failed at the game. If you get ressed then great but nobody is required to rez you
---
And at things like the meta events, a lot of people just afk them, die and then the rest of the raid has to pick up their slack, so if you died next to an afk, people's eyes will group you all together as lazy esspecially if you're just sitting there instead of doing anything (if you arent afk or lazy, then rez yourself)
---
Hey there, I PvP often because the reward is good and it's fun a good change of pacing from usual pve.
---
Unranked is not always the place for 'training' because there is no ladder and much less strict match making. Meaning you will likely be grouped with people who are way worse or way better than you. This rift in skill level is not conducive to learning.
---
You're better off in ranked where the game will match you with like-skilled players even if you're new you'll be new together.
---
Don't worry about to mindless "mid" screechers. They haven't played enough to know when to play sides. Or change their team strategy overall.
---
Rushing mid as soon as you respawn can lead to a lost game of your respawn is staggered, meaning your team will always be fighting outnumbered at mid and likely loosing.
---
I, personally, would like to see instanced, customizable player housing within guild halls, something that Anet REFUSES to give us because “we don’t want people to be taken out of the open world!” It’s fucking baffling because the potential for cosmetic gem store items for a player home are astronomical.
---
Were you the one that asked the same question while waiting for inquest mark II golem 2 days ago? This till an issue?
---
Damn, sorry to hear that, im glad you contacted support. My initial thought was that its on their end but maybe now its smething with card? (If u are same person i know you said that you have enough money, but maybe the bank reception is kind of invalid aka not used for online shopping or some sort)
---
And you're breathtaking.
---
Often after a battle you open boxes and check inventory, so you don't see dead people beside you. 
---
Another issue is that often random dead people are AFK so reviving them is just a waste of everyone's time. 
---
It's rare though. Usually I see people reviving others.
---
I prefer mirage. But that's just my opinion.
---
   
---
Would you mind telling me why? would help me decide.
---
I used to be this guy. 
---
Now I wvw daily and have 5 gifts of battle sitting in my bank because I can never decide which track I want to fill. So I just leave GoB track on auto repeat.
---
It's a bit complicated. Some players abuse the fact that everyone can rez everyone in GW2 and decide to skip on using waypoints altogether. They either afk or simply wait for others to rez them, despite WPs being cheap and close by. Which is not cool, especially not during a fight, where the boss scales. 
---
I used to rez everyone everywhere. But I've been playing the game for some years now and bad manners are starting to get on my nerves. 
---
For example in Sandswept Isles there's a meta where you fight 2 bosses one after the other and at the end you fight the both of them together. Essentially 3 fights, the last one being the hardest. People *always* die during the final battle and despite the WP being close and despite people telling them to use it, they decide to afk half the fight and wait for the rest of the players to finish it for them. That's just rude. 
---
So at the end of that meta I never rez anyone. Because 95% of the dead players are lazy asses who don't deserve it. And some of them have the nerve to ask for a rez too.
---
If you happen to be part of the 5% who just died at the end of the fight, then now you know - players like me kinda pair you with the overwhelming (bad) majority. 
---
But other than cases like this, people usually rez all the time. If they don't, they might be busy looking in their inventory after the fight. This will cover part of your screen and make you ignore chat. It has happened to me a couple of times.
---
I got my player amount to lowest to increase fps so don't see many players, also, lazy shits should just wp &gt;.&gt;
---
At u/Rohbo, In my opinion it's not what's missing from halls but how it was created. When you get use to hall layouts and you learn your way around you come to realize how many blocks/components were randomly placed everywhere. As a Scribe/Decorated, you'll quickly find that nothing lines up in any of the halls. Many things that should be symmetrical, aren't. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Secondly, as mentioned by u/Tokidoki_Tai, especially in the Gilded Hollow, much of the hall was scrapped due to time constraints on release. Gilded Hollow features two built in jumping puzzles where Lost Precipice has one and Windswept doesn't have any (from what I've heard). There's a second flood to the whole hall that's obstructed by a wall due to incompletion. Gliding mechanics were also removed from the hall. Occasional, with enough distance, you'll multiple updrafts appear in the hall but vanish on approach. Lastly, some upgradable wall obstructions, especially in the mine show other guild upgrades were planned but scrapped. The Crystal is missing its final growth and those walls are still blocking other areas of the hall that haven't opened as of yet. Surely, halls were meant to stop at lv69. 
---
What would I like to see? Originally, [Arena.net](https://Arena.net) stated they weren't adding trading/banking services to the halls to prevent players from visiting major cities like Lion's Arch. It was intended to retain population at the trading post, bank, and crafting station. However, we have convenient access gem store locations doing the same thing (though it at least generates them micro transactions). ~~Yes, the Scribing station has access to the Bank.~~ I would like to see an actual banker added for newer players who don't know to use the crafting station. The function is already there. I'd like Trading Post/Crafting services added as well (remember the temp/consumable crafting stations) even if it has some kind of material/currency sink like the Silverwastes Services Agent. I'd like to see more merchants based on HoTs and PoF such as the map currency vendors that exist at the start of all HoTs Maps. Even ambient NPCs with random dialogue would be a nice touch. Since the "Sittable" updates, I'd like all the furniture and clipping carpets from the tavern removed. :P 
---
I could list more but I'm sure this will spark conversation from others. If you want my further opinion, just ask. :)
---
I did it, it's dificult to get, have so meny walls, but in some point one wall grant you ground an the u just have to fly to the top.
---
https://imgur.com/a/DyvBuZ6
---
You answered your own question -- you can just WP, takes much less time then creating post on reddit. Also asking for rez is super annoying because people normally have better things to do then that
---
I wish crafting was this fast O_O
---
I had a dream last night that there was a door into cantha. Then I woke up
---
Because it takes over 5 seconds, they already got the achievement for reviving, and for them those 5 seconds are worth more than the silver it costs to use a waypoint.
---
People is more likely to get revived far from waypoints and in triky spots hard to run back to, like jumping puzzles and minidungeons.
---
If someone is defeated near a waypoint, they'll likely be considered AFK and ignored by anyone who doesn't need the exp or AP.
---
I would say that scourge is more team focused spec, and mirage is more self focused spec. Gameplay wise, both can generally do everything, one better than the other in certain areas. Before deciding, you should try them on pvp lounge for free if you have pof!
---
We're sorta of in a power meta for both classes. But generally looking you can tell whether a class leans power vs condi by looking at their profession mechanic, their 5th specizlation line which expands said mechanic, and a class's weapons. Base Necro can only eqiup a single condi weapon,  Death Shroud leans towards power, and Soul Reaping leans towards power builds.
---
Mesmers on otherhand can atleast eqiup 2 condi weapons, and clones + Illusions specilzation gives out Confusion dps in spades.
---
Then once we look into elite specs and the meta thigs look even worse for condi necro, with Mirages beating Reapers in every game mode, except possibly fractals.
---
With that said if you have more fun with necro over mesmer, than by all means go necro.
---
That's pretty much what we did, we were rushing to mid one after the other after respawn and getting hammered =) I didn't mind it, we had some wins and it was fun
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll learn scourge some more and give ranked a go. I also play at weird hours (AEST 8pm) so there are probably less people overall to be matched with
---
I'm still mid-read but oh my GOD Guild Hall decoration is actually a nightmare. The worst part is that guild decorations don't all have load distance parameters so all/most of them load at once, meaning you can make a gorgeous GHall that you have to scrap because it literally just crashes members with lower-end PCs. Whenever I redecorate for holidays I have to bug at least 1-2 of our players on worse PCs and cross my fingers they don't melt because I added a holo-dancer or, for some reason, siege golem.
---
(Windswept doesn't have a puzzle BUT tier 3 does have a Racetrack that's vaguely marked out with flags, which makes sense given the map)
---
Map currency NPCs would be a huuge added benefit! Add the HoT/PoF NPCs to the appropriate GHall with a T3 market and give the option to add the other one(s) either as guild upgrades, or as something the guild pays for weekly/monthly with something like Aetherium or Favor. Arenanet shied away from making the GHall replace cities, but ~~had no qualms with replacing cities for $20 in the gemstore~~ I think adding ones that don't turn the GHall into a one stop shop and/or making convenience NPCs have an upkeep cost would be a great compromise.
---
*Arenanet does another promotion where you log in and get 1 AP*
---
I play at AEST too! You'll be fine. At worst you'll see the same deadeye once every 3 match's but that's it.
---
Be aware that scourge usually are higher priority targets so position yourself accordingly
---
I still have not played enough with them to say which amuses me more, I just want to not regret it in a week xD
---
The true endgame
---
Doesn't he needs to be level 14 to unlock map completion?
---
To be honest I'm playing on a potato laptop that I even get 15-20 fps and 8-bit like graphics even with the lowest settings of all so everything literally looks super perfect to me on the native render and medium shaders (I only change the settings when I'm gonna take a screenshot tho lol) so I don't even see the purple aura-like colors on the skin on usual and I was actually a bit afraid to buy it because of that purple aura around but it turned pretty well on all of my characters and concepts. I was just surprised by the difference between high and medium shaders so wanted to share here. It fits super nice on my peach/white color themed mesmer tho so I'm pretty happy overall.
---
 Accidentally broke through the map boundaries for  Wing 7, The Key of Ahdashim.  So, decided to look around and explore.
---
Once you got a decent amount of gold from silverwastes, you can look into TP flipping and investment to get additional gold
---
Way up high above the middle of AB.
---
I think it can be counted as a cherrypicking as well?
---
I ripped my viper mirage, moved all gears to viper scourge, and make my Mesmer into a chrono support with diviner gears, works great in pve.
---
Thanks for the suggestions!
---
Also don't like the insect wings, waiting for new skins tbh... but hey if I were Anet I wouldn't care either cos people like them and it's selling :')
---
Locust surely sounds worthwhile, as I'll be doing lots of running. Thanks!
---
Right at release, the enrage timer was an issue for the vast majority of groups. We didn’t have any of the tools (apart from maybe frifox which was used by a few) or the understanding and mindset that we do today about dps and rotations. 
---
You have to remember some groups got their first gorse kills on power revenant with shiro for quickness because chronos weren’t outputting enough quickness.
---
Char slots cost 800 gems or ~250 gold. Plus about 50 gold for 5 20 slot bags, call it 300 total, or about 3g per slot. Upgrading a 20 to a 24 costs about 18 gold or 4.5g per slot and going to 28 costs about 24 gold, or 6g per slot. Finally 32's cost ~72 gold more, so 18g per slot. Given the hassle of moving things back and forth between characters I don't mind paying the slight premium to use 28 slotters and have more of my stuff in the same place but I'm not rich enough to splurge on 32's.
---
That's kind of what i was hoping. Like in ESO, leveling is a chance to try abilities and level them up without fear of messing anything up. I was hoping it'd be kind of the same here.
---
You need to get arcdps. It has build templates and fixes these issues.
---
Do you feel it was a good choice?
---
Maybe try to look the Laurel Vendor?
---
 Laurel Vendor
---
Care to elaborate?
---
This one is easy. Do the daily dwarf chamber the 2 meta s and some hearts. I finished this while also working on the istan collection. Now that one is a pain.
---
For branded mass
---
It also does a flash ever few seconds in combat and heals people around you. Plus the active you can full heal your entire team. Sucks if you have eplipsy though
---
No.
---
Lol
---
https://twitter.com/NahazDota/status/1030946715346526209
---
Gotta follow a script for the elaboration
---
Welcome to Hans' crash course in " Power Ranger Druid " 
---
Weapons: 
---
Beserker prefix of the following-
---
Greatsword ( zojjas ) - massive damage up close, Stun, knockback, and gap closer.
---
Greatbow ( or long bow if that's your prerogative/also zojjas ) - super long range dps, stealth, knockback, and vuln. 
---
Armor: 
---
If you like having Hp, and not being able to kill anything, but can support pretty well in a pinch, soldiers prefix.
---
If you like killing EVERYTHING, but being a little squishy that makes it hard to dip in and out of battle, go beserker. 
---
Acessories:
---
If you aren't a condition or heal build, always go zerker for these guys. 
---
Heal:
---
Your choice of trap heal or big heal. 
---
I prefer trap heal for big groups.
---
Active slots:
---
- you want dps? frost spirit: Crazy buff
---
- You want escapes/status breaks?: zephyr quicksteppy thing ( Will edit the real name )
---
- You want to jump in and make their life hell? and have a side heal in celestial form?: glyph of alignment ( fact checking. might edit )
---
Make sure frost is always up, and your pet and you will HURT. whenever your glyph is up and you don't foresee yourself dying, dodge in and use it, then zephyr ( or whatever it's called ) out. 
---
Elite skill: 
---
Personal preference honestly.
---
Supporty?: why not druid spirit
---
Damagey?: pick something ouchy 
---
Want a little of both?: go invuln and summon some seed turrets. 
---
Now the fun part is the buffs. 
---
Survival and skirmish are your core. 
---
Druid fortifies all your support abilities.
---
( Might edit in actual names for the build when I get the chance )
---
People always end up asking me what the hell my build is, and I always tell them. It's fun. not easy, but fun either way. 
---
Hope this helps you out at all ^_^
---
Fully dead get no rez.....unless were far out of wp distance, plus usually 50% of the time if I do try a full dead res, they will  wp away right before I heal them, I also  wp away fast if I'm fully dead because I don't want to waste their time
---
For PVE, yes
---
For sPvP you could always change your build so I don’t think that’s what you are asking.
---
For wvw, maybe not I’ve never played chrono in wvw.
---
a stack of quartz is like 2 gold
---
cringe and boring, it feels more like a chore than playing a game to do it these days, even though it's so easy.
---
This one is literally for gay
---
Been awhile since I’ve seen an all is vain reference... I really hope it makes it into the game in some small corner one day.
---
&gt; Right so time is money. You can spend time or spend money to shorten the time it would take to get infinite keys via farming. Everything in this game is gambling. Mystic forge, mob drops. It's all RNG based loot
---
Doesn't work that way. RNG that is the result of play activities (ie, kill a monster, drop loot) is not gambling, because there is no ante, and time alone is not an ante. Black Lion Chests using free keys *only* is not gambling, because the keys are free, but *allowing* you to buy keys *makes* it gambling, because now the option is available to pay an ante to make the gamble. That's the distinction. If they *only* had free keys, if you could *not* buy keys using cash (or cash fungible currencies), then it would not be gambling, but because you can, it is. 
---
&gt;So my argument is if you dislike gambling in this game then you dislike rng as well and then they might as well can the game since it's all RNG gamble. And then my argument is, why are you playing the game?
---
Because I enjoy the gameplay experience itself. I've never met a game in which I enjoy every single aspect of it 100%. There are plenty of things that I dislike about this game, some, but not all of them involving RNG aspects, but the good still outweighs the bad, in my own opinion. That's why I am playing the game. 
---
But that doesn't mean that I don't advocate for changes that I feel would further improve the game, or that I wouldn't cheer if such changes were implemented. 
---
&gt;How is it fair that I did a meta event 600 times for an infusion and spent hours of my time doing it. And some guy walks in first try and gets it. Why don't we all get infusions everytime we do an event 100%? Oh cuz it's a gamble and that creates item exclusivity which we all enjoy flaunting.
---
I do agree that there should be more balance to such things. I have never been in favor of pure RNG acquisition of things, and even since the early days of the game I have advocated that there should be more alternatives, such as the Precursor crafting they added, or for in cases where something is a 1% drop, they could also provide tokens 100% of the time, which would eventually add up to the same thing, ensuring that even if lucky people can get something a bit earlier, unlucky people would still have a reasonable path they could pursue. 
---
I think a bit of chaos can be fun, I'm not 100% opposed to all randomness. My concerns are in cases where the odds are too poor, or in cases where cash money is involved. In the former case, I believe the issue is just that odds too low are demoralizing when you don't get something you very much want. I think players should be happy when they get something a bit easier than they'd expected, but should not be sad that it isn't coming even after they keep trying. There should be safety nets. To the second point,  I think that involving cash just creates corrupt motivations on the part of developers, to design content that exploits human weakness and encourages reckless spending. Players should not be able to spend money to participate in RNG processes, because developers cannot handle that responsibility. GW2 is hardly the worst game when it comes to this, but it's far from innocent either.

If players "spend their time" to acquire something, ANet gets no direct benefit from that, so they have no corrupt motive to get players to pay more than the player *wants* to spend. If players spend their *cash* to get something, then ANet gets that cash, so they have a corrupt motive to try to encourage players to spend that cash, and when it comes to gambling mechanisms, it's been well established that gambling mechanisms lead to unhealthy spending habits in at least some portion of the playerbase.
---
Idk if it's off meta or not, but that works super well with the rune/sigal that replenishes your dodge bar after an enemy is killed. Good luck  working on this
---
which tends to give this community (at least the ones who agree with the general opinion) an undeserved perception as being one of the better gaming communities. every time i see a post like that i just think, sure it would seem that way if you've never had a dissenting opinion before but hell hath no fury like a gw2 player fact checked.
---
Or they could just make them work the same way underwater weapons work, swap to them the moment you enter underwater. Content-wise, they can easily add underwater raids/fractals and bring back the underwater PvP map (which would be a good selling point for the new underwater elite specs).

Cool, but pressing 1 button to deny a 1 shot is not skill.
---
&gt; Are they? I see poeple say that about WoW still, raids are just gambling machines that spit out loot anyways, also where did i ever mention raids? 
---
Raids aren't really a gamble in ffxiv. Also, dungeons and raiding are the main content in MMOS, most people do not PVP.
---
&gt; Yes you can if your team mate knows what they are doing and doesn't facetank shit, there was a 2v2 tournament and the comp that won was literally firebrand scourge. Healers are just unbalanced and enhance a team so much that they become overbearing if the other team doesn't have one, in literally any MMO with healers the healers are OP. 
---
But my teammate shouldn't have to know what theyre doing for me to heal them xD
---
Healing should rely on the healer's skill, not anybody elses.
---
&gt; **Where did i ever mention bosses**, exactly, not working togheter isn't teamwork and that drags the team down, exactly what i said, teamwork. 
---
Bosses are why MMOs are played...

This game doesn't serve people stuff up on a silver platter. Let me ask  you? What was stopping you from making your own LFG for dungeons? What is stopping you from joining a guild and having people to play with. I play with dozens of people regularly, but I can't say you will.
---
You can get the expansions and join a raid training guild, if that's your thing plenty of those. There are all sorts of events going on all the time...but no one is going to just randomly contact you and play with you, except maybe me. lol
---
If you're on a US server, hit me up in game on Vayne.8563. I can show  you around and give you a feel for what you'd get if you do buy the expansions.
---
Real question: are you in a guild? Guilds often start groups and can become friends of yours in the game very easily.
---
Who said I wasn't? One day, I made an LFG for the 2nd dungeon and waited for 1 hour in front of the dungeon for anyone to come and then just went to farm for 2-3 hours with the LFG still active. 
---
And nothing is stopping ME from joining a guild. I just don't know how to and nobody invited me so I don't really know what to even do about it.
---
I don't mean I want someone to randomly contact me, I actually try to make myself pretty available but I just don't feel like it's easy to get into the crowd in this game. I don't know, man. And I am on EU sadly lmao
---
No I am not. I don't know how to join one and I am pretty clueless about them
---
Poor content doesn't mean no content. There has been minimal effort put into raids for a good while, including the recycling of models and mechanics (though I really don't see the similarity between Sabir and Twilight Oasis, you might be teaching there). I agree with the lack of moving bosses, but that doesn't change this being new content
---
literally the link we replied to https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery_point_unlocks
---
Core guardian btw can be really good on Conjured Amalgamate since afair DH f1 and traps wouldn't work on both arms and Boss and you can keep up a good aegis uptime during the burn phase
---
buy the item for the npc
---
Ah I understand your struggle. Even though I enjoy playing solo, I started feeling its limitations. I really recommend joining a guild as well. I believe theres a subreddit r/guildrecruitment (?) something along those lines where you can look for any guild recruiting. A lot of them specify what they focus on, that way you can search for a guild specific to your tastes(for example: If you’re looking to get started on fractals/raids there are guilds that will post that).
---
That expansion was Guild Wars trying to act like Dark Souls.

Haha thanks!

Diviner's mesmer is in a pretty odd place nowadays, it's not in the current meta fractals comp but still occasionally taken in more casual teams that still run druids.
---
In raids, you still have at least one mesmer but it's sometimes a minstrel tank.
---
you're not wrong by any means, but it's undeniable a sense of community was lost with the megaservers merging groups.
---
It would be nice if they could institute a district system as they had in the first game. International, US (En) , EU (En, De, Fr, etc..) would very much help individuals find some sense of community with their own nationalities, a common ground to see people they'll see again, while still providing a platform to play with others.
---
obviously, this has no application within WvW due to it's inherent nature, but it is isolating to be forced into communicating with a language you are entirely unfamiliar with (in which i am speaking from general, external experience in this respect). Even if server numbers are low, and that the reason for this decision is similar to the megaserver decision, it strikes me as an ill-advised decision, and very anti-consumer, or at very least, anti-nonenglish natives.
---
Now time for Norn love. Off to the Far Shiverpeaks to get some content with norn specific dialogue, ride some Viking ships, worship some ghostly good bois and see the giant tattooed hunters do some badassery like lifting mountains and tossing away great foes like it's just another day at work.
---
Can't if you die during the fall, and that's the issue with this specific dive.

As I told that very same person, a better longer lasting alternative is hovering over the lfg and typing /block with the name of the commander. Won't see their selling lfgs again
---
What are some of the easiest class (in terms of survivability and damage) for solo play (especially in LS &amp; expansion maps)?

Have Kralkatorric fly over and brand the whole waterpark while we're at it.

I play both , infinite mirage and thinking man scourge , both are very good at soloing . But scourge is also a godlike support in group play.

You can google staff/staff mirage or "thinking man scourge" on youtube.

As long as mounts don't have any way of breaking sequence, for lack of a better word, that sounds like a valid solution.
---
I'm playing for a month or so, so I'm kind of fresh with the level 80 struggle :D Here what I did.
---
I've tested if I like game for free getting level 80. After I was happy with it I've got expansions and ultimate version of PoF.
---
For gems from ultimate I've got myself a set of zerk gear without trinkets so I can do some damages.
---
Then I went to do first chapter of PoF to get the mount, to save some time and be able to run over the mobs (very important in HoT IMO) and yesterday I've finished HoT storyline.
---
Now I'm in a reasonably happy place where I have mount to get to places faster and gliding to pretend I can fly ;)
---
Next step for me is farming Hero points to get elite spec unlocked and I'll return to the story as it's quite interesting and gives nice training how to play your character.
---
On the meta level - you can watch some tutorials on YouTube about things. I'm listening to them like to a podcast in the office. It's a pretty fast way to learn about mechanics of the game.
---
You can choose between scorched fields and volcanos, permafrost mountain areas or underwater caves.
---
Pretty damn great :D
---
Daily and monthly reviver achi helped a lot ;-)
---
Poor Canach...
---
I didn't know that was a thing, I'm not big on achievements myself. That's a neat idea though.

It is a joke from before the release of GW2. There was an introduction video for each of the classes before release, and the "intoduced" the commando class: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR2Esy83MQ0
---
Viable dps builds: water ele, guardian, condi engi, mesmer, probably thief
---
Supports: thief, warrior, healer engi
---
What?! Sounds like that one instance where skritt jumped out of the mystic toilet and gave you a ton of gold once you killed them.
---
Maybe an easteregg?
---
Guild wars 2 had a class reveal for the Commando as an April fool's joke. They did a quest line in gw1 that featured them in a terminator style storyline
---
Hello, what are good ranged combination for endgame pve content? I curently have warrior and ele at lvl 80, and while warrior is fun, i'd like to try something ranged. Is ranger viable? what else?
---
thanks in advance
---
U don’t even know how many times i wiped because of meta, people refuse to pick safer option(but with worst kill time) resulting in many more wipes....
---
The game checks what it needs to download per file, and if there is a series of small files the checks in between limit the download rate.

Here's a screenshot: https://i.redd.it/qzr8yy6tz8n11.jpg

I take permafrost than. As there is a nature law that every villain likes sand, lava...

There is no voting for kick, there is an option to go with some people or all the group to the next match

It has a mastery that makes you stronger when you're downed, and one that lets you collect unbound magic
---
aurora
---
I know about that obsession. It's so dumb that they cut that content out.
---
It's actually pretty easy to get up there now. Just go to the mastery point under the place  - jump out and fly to the left and upwards. :)
---
Yup. It's an engi elite. I'm not too sure about holo mechanics to say that it's completely ranged, but check it out.
---
Why is crest  of assassin so expensive?  Because of the stats?
---
It's not gatekeeping, we don't want people to rip off players that really don't need to pay in order to do raids, there are so many great people who will teach newcomers to raid for free, that consulting sellers is just mindboggling to me
---
Then wait.
---
Since you said you don't care about maps or story, here is my take:
---
If you are into ascended gearing your 400 toons, S3 is a blessing.
---
Bitterfrost berries can be gathered quite fast and use it to buy ascended trinkets quite fast (Bitterfrost is also a very stunning map especially if you have a griffon or a skyscale)
---
Bloodstone fen map currency let's you buy ascended trinkets that can be stat swapped any time with a very small fee (that makes them legendary trinkets without any visual noise)
---
Achievement points - If you are a collector, this is a must.
---
LS3 is not too expensive and sometimes they are on discount. You can also buy episode by episode by converting gold to Gem so no need to use real $ as well.
---
There is no mounts in LS3. Mounts started with PoF.
---
Won't be hard for long since he bet on a certain someone to defeat a certain someone.
---
Canach will be swimming in riches like Scrooge McDuck soon enough!
---
The maps are still p dead.
---
Guild Wars 2 is a game that respects you time.  
---
...unless you actually want to spend a full day or two to binge hashing out on a collection.  Then you just get punished for wanting to play for more than an hour on any given day. :)
---
Necro is amazing for open world or doing stuff, it has decent self buffing and dmg. Condi falls off in fractals, i would not recommend that, but scourge is nice for progression compared to a mirage. for raids, mirage pulls ahead on more Condi variable bosses, while scourge is below average on dps. 
---
if you never want to die in open world dire/ trailblazer scourge is one of the tankiest builds that still do good dmg. I do not recommend those stats for group play tho.
---
while the dredge can not be blinded
---
Fight fire with fire, by burning a fire elemental, you burn oxygen around it, denting it, suffocating it, therefore dealing damage.
---
Here in gw2 lore we can explain anything and everything. Welcome.
---
i guess it kinda depends also on the age.  
---
people which are lets say 40+ and never needed to speak english and those which are in the range of 17 are still learning big time to actually speak it.  
---
of all the germans i encountered in raiding in gw2 for example the vast majority can and did speak english. for example the people i raid with right now since a few months are only german, but if we get a pug and hes on our discord we swap to english instantly so he doesn't feel left out in case he is not german.  
---
saw this happen in many other groups too.  
---
also back in the days of glory in wvw on riverside, when redguard was on our server for a bit, the language was english and this was announced before so people would know.  
---
while a few will have problems, i think the majority of germans won't have any and there will just be a phase to get used to english.
---
That starts with someone beating your Dog though, that's more like John Wick.
---
They aren't gathering 9 buyers though. It's a guild that uses 7 or 8 people to carry the buyers. They are just advertising their service, which the new rule was created to stop.

But like I said, nothing changed, so Anet can't care all that much. Why not just create another spot for it?

I have never seen that. But I have seen the bottom of ab

I thought so, too, until I had to identify and salvage 25 stacks of gear. Being able to simply identify a whole stack, salvage, dump in the bank and repeat the whole process is a lifesaver. I can't even remember when I had problems with inventory space the last time. Being full 32 slot is a ridiculously decadent QoL upgrade.

This was one clip of a much larger stream. Having watched the entire stream, I would not label it 'faked over-reacting,' though I could see how one might believe this with just the clip in isolation. Also, I can attest that, without any cameras around, she is actually quite one to overreact when it comes to bunnies. I have yet to suspect that she is faking these reactions though.

Well all the reasons mentioned above. And after the 1000 rev achievement, there is really no incentive.

Seems so. But more then a wield effect it's about it being just ghostly compared to the "physical " original version.

What do you want the community to do for you? Nobody here can answer your question, and you’ve already sent a ticket to the best qualified people, support, who actually can answer your question, so just be patient. And in your responses why are you so adamant about buying the expansions in game? Try buying them from the website.

So much was cut and/or altered that it really does make for an interesting story. Tarir looked completely different in the [release trailer](https://youtu.be/IOUk2y0K2m8).
---
I'd theorise that they couldn't make the meta event work with an open plan Tarir, so it was probably a matter of making the world fit the mechanics, but the previous version looked beautiful.
---
How is blocking them not productive? In the long run you'll save on the effort from not having to do the thing in the screenshot every damn time because it doesn't save.

If you need to do any HoT mastery leveling, it is way easier and faster to fly around blood Stone fen collecting unbound magic orbs than playing hot content.

More NPCs like map currency traders, wvw traders and PvP traders could all added with out too much hazzle. Yes the guild hall wasn't supposed to be competition to the gm store passes or cities, but how often do you honestly use those NPC's? And the heart of the mists and wvw maps have all these endorsed a bank and a trading post just a click away and you can return to the same location you left. So guildhalls wouldn't really give any advantage. If anet feels generous they could add a mystic forge that need the mobile forge consumable. There also is still no PoF music selection possible for guildhalls. A ls3 and ls4 gathering node could also be added that rewards random map materials. For more work it would help if the arena/ GH map used your wvw build and balanced skills. Having the option to get a spvp arena server that is directly linked to your guild would also be cool.
---
Well panel 5 doesn't seem so bad...
---
Wiki is just as good, for skyscale, mix it with TACO
---
Not sure about other stuff, but again wiki always has answers.
---
I'm glad you asked. Crowd sourcing a solution could result in someone who had a similar situation explaining what can be done to resolve it before support gets involved. It could resolve the issue faster for the user and means one less ticket support will need to address, potentially improving response times across the board.
---
Had a wonderful experience the other day where I saw a player struggling near me and they got downed, I head over to help and get one shotted.. They got themself back up and I just said "hey can I get a rez please?" (we were really far out from a wp in an awkward place) and they stand next to me and go "did you help me kill those mobs? Nah. You didn't." and left
---
Called them a turd. Made a point not to help when they asked things in map chat... Passive aggressive ftw XD
---
Mmh... the Commander has to deal with some gnarly stuff too, though. I think the big difference is the commander gets to change attire every now and then, but Canach.... no matter what, he can't dye his clothes bright yellow and pink if he wants to. :(
---
By all Six Gods, what is that thing, it’s huge!
---
125 actually. 100 + 25 for the ectoplasmic stone.
---
Done plenty of rounds where we have 5 minutes left after killing all bosses
---
Fractals is also a good choice but can't go too wrong getting your first zerker set in my opinion
---
QQadim. Add more Q's if he's added in another raid somehow.
---
From what I can gather it's people who want the AP/rewards, they can afford to buy gems and convert to gold but do not feel like they have the time to learn the mechanics or join a static because of real life constraints.
---
Anyone got a good, sturdy chrono build for open world/soloing PVE? As faceroll-y as possible...
---
Without knowing what you're actually playing it's a bit hard to help you.
---
But generally, the most important skill to learn in the game is dodging, hands down. If you get knocked down constantly, learn their tells and try to avoid getting hit in the first place. Also, equip a skill that gives you stability and something that removes conditions.
---
While I appreciate your need to stand up for your wife, that clip is really obvious.
---
Streamers these days who are trying to get over do this \*all the time\*. They get some drop and ham it right up for a reaction clip.
---
There's nothing actually wrong with this. There are a lot of people who gobble up this kind of content, some buy in and enjoy it for the personality. 
---
But the insincere and overdone way your wife expresses this is pretty standard stuff. It's the reason I wont watch Peachy's GW2 streams because this kind of inauthentic behavior is not something I personally enjoy.
---
Thanks for the tips! :) I only recently found out about mount ability 2 and figured out how to use it but I don't like it because it makes me go slower so I rarely use it. I tried doing the griffon adventure thing in Jahai and I have no earthly idea how you're supposed to maintain altitude enough to keep off the ground at all times. Maybe there's some tutorials on youtube or something but I'm at least glad I'm not forced to do it for the sake of the achievement.
---
It's a threat
---
and there's no reason to play some fking glass cannons with 0 survi and utility, not every chrono is good enough to carry u with his utilities so pick fking safe option or let's take fking easier strat not a SUPER FAST ONE, WOHOO WE WIPED 10 TIMES WHILE WE COULD DO THIS FIRST TIME BUT 1 MIN LONGER ;\_ ;

So tired of the “post a random photo not relevant to gw2 and try to make it relevant to gw2” posts. So fucking lazy.

I don't really need to stand up for her, but since we both love the GW2 community I'm keen to practice some patience. Considering this was literally her first stream I don't think she's aware of such a pro move like you're describing. It's also worth keeping in mind that people's behaviour, and that's considered 'normal', varies.
---
Dire is fine. i honestly would just get a full set of dire if you're trying to play condition damage in wvw. power is better though.

why exactly a problem, what made you choose this word?

That looks good my man, I'll take two please.

Arenanet isnt about to invalidate all that old content with something as niche as underwater elite specialization. The only thing keeping the game fresh is new way to do combat.
---
The wall isn't as high around it. There's lower gaps. I walked over them with skyscale and they weren't a single flat wall, but several walls disposed around it at different heights.
---
Why buy something perfectly likable with a code, it's for achieves or items, and lazy people who want to see a raid, without going through trouble of gathering a group, and doing tries.
---
Yeah at the moment I cannot be bothered myself. It kinda bothers me that I don't have max masteries and I've seen the cool skills the skyscale has, so I will definitely get it. Though, for the moment I've had enough to do in my little time with raids and the new legendary ring, shortly after finishing the new greatsword, so I'll be doing the Skyscale after those.  
---
Don't worry about it too much, you sill have a couple months until the next patch hits lol
---
Not sure if you noticed but we already have an achievement for exactly that.
---
^^ hopefully you'll never need this knowledge in day to day life but I'm glad it helped maybe xD
---
Man that trailer was so hype, the game was so hype, i miss that time :(
---
Illusions don't dodge, don't use skills besides autoattack and move completely different to a player. Also pressing t in team fights targets the current teams target automatically.
---
So is it possible it’s still tied? You’d need one person to progress the event while another watches Bjarni.
---
Obviously mesmer. Base mesmer is stronger than every specialisation in the game
---
Why just a 28 slot and not a 32 slot one? You can already get a 32 slot bag in sandswept island and several 20 slot bags through achievements. Would it be nice to easily get one? Sure, but I don't think it is necessary.
---
DONT YOU DARE TO EVEN THINK ABOUT CHANGING MY DUNGEONS THAT I PLAY THE SAME WAY FOR LAST 3 YEARS
---
&gt; The bag can only be gotten *once*.
---
or 
---
&gt; One way to get tons of people on dungeons for a long long time
---
choose one. also, why exactly a 28 slot bag, and not a 20 or 32 slot bag?
---
They pretty much are a direct upgrade
---
You know that default look that all other players get when you set the Character Model Detail to lowest? Are there actual in-game skins that match those looks? I want to make my character look like that. I already have the dye narrowed down.
---
Joining a friendly , active guild will make a huge difference. You will have a large group of people to chat with , learn the game from , and make groups with until you realize better how to go about things. Don't judge based on dungeons , because they are the least done group content by far. And while levelling , you rarely NEED groups. You're 80 now , things are a bit different. 
---
I dunno about on EU , but on NA I see at least 30-40 guild recruit messages in chat per day. You have 5 guild slots , it's perfectly fine to message these people , join up for a while , and see if they fit for you.
---
They are a non-canon joke made canon by this little stunt.
---
In lore, they are from an alternate version of Tyria in which humans and charr never stopped their war, and their arms race resulted in military technology developing to levels similar to the late 20th century in Earth.
---
In GW1, a human A.R.E.N.A. squad traveled to the past after the charr sent an golem to the past to kill the mother of The Goremonger, but only one of them made it through. So he gets help from the hero of GW1 to stop the Annihilator golem.
---
They sent a second metallic ooze golem to kill the Goremongre directly, and that second time you control a classic golem to fight it instead.  
---
Then history goes back to normal and humans and charr made a treaty to deal with the dragons. But apparently that alternate timeline is still happening in their own alternate Tyria.
---
So now both GW and GW2 have canon April's Fools jokes.
---
That trailer. Holy shit. I started playing after PoF was released, so I take a lot of things in the game for granted. I can't imagine the hype for HoT after core Tyria (and LWS1 and LWS2), given that trailer. So much new stuff packed into that release and mentioned in the trailer. Makes the LW trailers look meh.
---
I am on EU. Pm me your gametag and Ill send you invites to guild and help you
---
Pretty sure Dulfy has videos of the Gold on the Griffon adventures. 
---
Using both mount ability 1 and 2 is essential. Yes, you lose speed by using mount ability 2, but you gain altitude. 
---
Basically Mount Ability 1 on the griffon trades altitude for speed and Mount Ability 2 trades speed for altitude.
---
Selling SAB was wrong.
---
Selling RAID is good.
---
Fuck logic. Consistent inconsistency.
---
It's not always purple, that's just a weird thing that people noticed when it first released and everyone ran with it. The shader on the wing is trying to emulate an iridescent reflection. It varies based on what colour you used. Admittedly most combinations do lean towards blues, purples and pinks. I think green dyes look great with the blueish shimmer effect, personally. Not always purple though and the mount has certainly grown on me once I played around with the dye combinations a bit. :)

Wait a sec. But your statement literally says, that's Anet don't have balls to do it.

&gt; probably out of fear that they just quit the game

They chickened.

How often you was in pug's raid where ppl actually listened to what they do wrong? 1-2 out of 10. Also they can read. So it's not like

There IS google, reddit, youtube. They DON'T wanna to do it.

&gt; On one side you have ppl who aren't used to click more than 1111111, on another side you have ppl who have brains

I corrected that for you

the raid selling groups are usually just 1/10, so theyre at the bottom of the list (and thus easy to ignore) anyway.

Ha, very interesting, thanks for the info!

How can i answer your vague question if i have no basis? 
---
My kid nephew why was our toaster blue? he doesn't like blue. That's pretty much how your question sounds to me.
---
I use Reinforced Olmakhan Bandolier, it's a 32 slot bag that if possible, containers and consumable items will fill this box before other empty spaces. You can get it from achievement from LS4E2.
---
I also have 20 slot fractal bags that put masterwork gear together and I have 18 slot oiled bag for trash items in the bottom.
---
My outline for bags is, not counting shared inventory slots,
---
Two general bags
---
Reinforced Olmakhan Bandolier
---
3 fractal bags
---
2 general slot bags
---
Oiled bag.
---
That keeps my inventory very decently pre sorted.
---
I play on my main 99% of the time so I invested in having big and fairly pre sorted inventory. Change to unidentified gear everywhere made my inventory so so much cleaner and Reinforced Olmakhan Bandolier even more worth it.
---
Imma do this.
---
That’s a great one, thanks!
---
How much effort is it to get 6 Guild Wars 1 Hall of Monument points for GW2?
---
5 would be serving under Anise and having her trying to grind his will into the dust.
---
Right. I forgot to mention I only play PvE myself so that doesn't help me.
---
You can only report when right clicking a lfg, not block. You need to join them to block them. How do you know they swapped character?
---
Sort of?!
---
CTRL + T marks the enemy with a big crosshair above their head and press T will target the marked target. AFAIK this gets removed when Stealth is casted so you would have to reapply this whenever they use stealth.
---
But, marking an enemy will do this for your whole team with the same crosshair but also with ping on the minimap.
---
And then you have the usual things, clones/illusions are predictable in their movement. They usually use the shortest and direct path to you which means that they go in a straight line if possible and they attack while being stationary. A player moves around, dodges and jumps which makes them easier to spot.
---
We have a collection for that too - dungeoneer

I was browsing /freefolk a second ago and I was wondering what D&amp;D had to do with this

Kind of hard to answer your question because it depends on what you want.
---
Minis, vs housing nodes, vs ascended gear, vs legendaries, vs other goal of what you want out of the game.
---
I love these types of videos. Without a preview option for infusions, it's always difficult to gauge how some infusions look stacked together. Thanks for the video!
---
This is clearly a memy post and not to be taken seriously but I just want to say that, while those podcasts of Teapot are very insightful in some ways, they should not be taken to heart. 
---
The reason most people dont group is because the game was built like so. People grouped up for HoT hero points train for instance. When they are required to do so, they will. 
---
It is very important to note this. Its not a problem with the population is a problem with the game design. Anet consistently made the game easier to be soloable so that is accessible (and it worked, at any time of the day you can login and play your fav game mode) but it has its issues. Similar MMOS are experiencing similar issues as well. 
---
This lead to the question: Would we rather have a less accessible game at the cost of less players (and possibly less income) and a more accessible game but a shallower one too. This problem comes in shades .. its not simply black or white solutions.
---
&gt; The bag can only be gotten once.

One way to get tons of people do the content in the first few days and then never again.

Your first run in with canach is giving him a beat down for blowing up some consortium resort that they were trying to build in southsun cove.
---
Had the same problem yesterday after 4 or 5 games.
---
Thanks! I see that the entire bundle is $40 USD, does it go on sale often?
---
That's a mess. Thanks for testing &amp; sorry for not trusting your findings before, it just always worked without issues for me (so far)
---
Guess it's time for a bugreport
---
&gt; I know Anet said they wouldn’t work on dungeons, but can the reward nerfs get reversed?
---
You are a few years too late, that already happened. Dungeon rewards now/still are better than they ever were.

Yes, how am I supposed to get past this blockade! If only there was a button to press to make my mount jump up for a moment while I move forward at the same time...
---
Effect text is copied from hexblade but that is a very strong effect so had to restrain it to once per round. I was thinking of using reaction on that feature but then unrestrained smites would be even more powerful than Shield of Courage, and did not have a better language to use than once per round.
---
Oh man, it took days of recording people's replies, and hours and hours of extracting all the replies and creating the video of it. I don't know if it was worth it but now all I dream of is coleslaw
---
Can confirm. This is also why burning doesn't work against destroyers: they don't need to breathe (since they live underground).
---
Do you have an ingame char named Gertrude? Your name is familiar, I swear I saw you at Golem MKII couple days ago.
---
&gt; Can you list this content please because I can only think of the Dungeon Traders.
---
Dungeon trinkets you can craft, gifts for legendaries and dungeon runes maybe, but all of them can be obtained pretty easy. I don't see any need for a change here.
---
It's all about the coleslaw.
---
Yes it is true. Casuals are handicapped.

Hold on to karma and laurels... to spend them on what?
---
Off topic , but where them revenant swords at from this art ? Been waiting since revs released :(
---
Not super often, no. Though it's only in the past year or so that the game has gotten some love from a couple of people of ANet, and it has gone on sale twice, I think(?) in the past year. It may go on sale again for GW2's birthday this year, but there's been no real trends for this stuff yet.

Ty
---
&gt; hoping people would switch their zekers gear and try something else.
---
the people that changed their gear are the ones that are weak to pocket raptors. those of us that stayed zerker actually have no problem with them, pocket raptors die in a single hit.
---
it's not the case i know that these hitboxes doesn't move.
---
What im talking about is that u can't place any on ground targetable skills behind/near or inside these hitboxes making them impossible to use
---
I convert everything I can besides winterberries (for trinkets) into either unbound or volitile magic. That way I have reserves for whatever I'm going for. If I need a shit ton of obby shards I can get them, if I need a fuck ton of something else, I can get that. All without spending karma
---
If you die next to a worldboss, it means you died basically right next to a WP. If you can't be bothered to port yourself and walk the 10 seconds back during the fight, then lots of people, me included, simply won't bother to rez your lazy ass after the fight's done. Simple as that.
---
Cheapest way to get 20s is probably either fractals, wvw, or just tp
---
They did play with this a little, allowing fire damage weapons like the Firey Dragon Sword skin or Incenerator with fire damage to burn the infested crops in Kourna IIRC. (I assume because they match the damage type of the torch bundle)  
---
Also RIP if you walk in there with an AoE Justice and that torch skill proc on your guard.  Hit one crop and the whole field lights... Your good deed has been undone by your own actions.  Feels bad man.  
---
Of course that's when you go get your engi, whip out the trusty old flame thrower and BURN EVERYTHING ~~TO BE EVIL~~ Just in case it's infested.
---
But the Aura of virtue eats spell slots, so you wouldn't want to use that every turn anyway, having both cost reaction would make it one or the other, but currently you can do both, which seems a little unreasonable.
---
Yeah. But you don't have to force players to team up by making things impossible to solo to get them to team up.
---
You just have to make it easy enough. 
---
In dungeons and fractals, there's a button to open the LFG to search for other players, but it doesn't do anything else. And for story instances there's no lfg button at all.  
---
In most cases people won't even open the LFG panel and set an lfg for story since it takes ages to get a party fill but anything except achievements for a recept story release. And the less people do it, the less people bothers even checking the LFG since they think nobody does. 
---
In games like Borderlands you can actually get automatically matched with people at the same story progress as you, and in games like Dead Island there was a "nearby players" system that would dynamically put you in parties with people in the same area of the map doing the same quests as you without reloading anything. You basically phased into their game, or they got phased into yours, without loading screens.
---
If story instances had a button you can click and the LFG panel had a checkbox you can activate that would automatically try to match you with players doing the same things are you are doing, a lot of people would enable it and play with others more often.
---

---
While in-game: type /wiki event timer 
---
Press enter. It'll open your Internet up which will direct you to where literally everybody is at and you'll find mass amounts of people in those areas.
---
Sadly more then half of these may not work after map change.
---
Great that you showed this and the community needs them but the content may be misleading.
---
I think that's the "Ron" guy Brazil is always talking about. He's totally and completely "Ron".
---
People want to do things in parties. But the lfg isn't good enough to get them to play together. 
---
Things don't have to be hard enough to force players to play in parties if joining together is easy enough.
---
The LFG is compeltely manual, without a way to enable a setting to automatically match you with people doing the same things as you, it depends on people setting lfgs and waiting for them to be responded.  
---
We can see this working for story matching in a lot of games. Diablo III, Borderlands, Dead Island... if joining together is easy, people who want to play with others will do it. If it's too bothersome, they'll resign themselves to playing solo.
---
Well. If it was done the same way as season one you wouldn't be able to get it at all!
---
Good morbid comedy is the smartest comedy.
---
ok
---
tell me how often we get new fractals and raids and how many actually raid in this game
---
The only winning move is not to raid.
---
The reason why is certainly the huge development time it would ask for the little value of this it.
---
Some people consider PvP as the end game. But still, as others said play ranked (fist 10 matches you will place in a team with a random rating. So you might find it much difficult to win; some might be high rank or skilled players while others are not.)
---
After that, you will be given your rank and placed based on it. But you will have to be a bit familiar with the maps and some un-said PvP roles so you won't get people to call you.)
---
If you want to play as solo as it gets, just do like me: "Appear offline &amp; Turn off chat!"
---
Still, I really enjoy 1v1 (dueling all the time) even that the game is not rewarding.
---
Just cause you don't like something doesn't mean you gotta be a dick about it
---
Oh okay! I can see how that makes sense. Im only 32 right now and even completing stuff barely rewards me gear wise. Its a pain in the ass lol 
---
Thank you for the info though, I really appreciate the heads up on everything!
---
who the fuck said i don't like raids
---
If it's just the rings spamming 5 days of t1 fractals give you both rings. The other items are more time consuming (though more affordable than the crafted ones still).
---
You may want to buy 2hands weapons on fractals and 1hand weapons in raid in the long term but at this time you probably just open your bank and pick a chest
---
It's season 1.

During the very first release, The Lost Shores, while investigating what the karka were and why they're attacking specific places in the shoreline, we encounter Canach for the first time. Here he was a mercenary hired by the Consortium to lead a survey team on a newly discovered still-volcanic island (the western Southsun Cove) and they ended up encountering and enraging the karka and retreated to LA and then went into hiding to avoid backlash from the Lionguard. The Commander finds Canach hold up in Garrenhoff and beats some answers out of him before capturing him, taking him to the Lionguard, who force him to escort them on Southsun Cove. He ends up escaping during the battle against the Ancient Karka (the karka's hive leader), where - offscreen - he goes to Ascalon and gets involved with the Molten Alliance.
---
Next time we see him, it's Secret of Southsun release (which happens after the MA stuff), where he's using pollen from home-bread flowers to make the karka and other wildlife on Southsun go wild to attack the Consortium who - via contracts - effectively enslave refugees of the MA attacks and force them to settle Southsun Cove (naturally, they were lied to by the Consortium of their living arrangements and the hostility of the wildlife, so many were upset). Thus Kiel and the Commander once again tracks down, beats up, and imprison Canach, this time sending him straight to Fort Marriner jail. Where he stayed (unseen as Mai Trin took up the only visible jail cell cage) until Scarlet Briar's attack on LA where he escapes with the Lionguard and is re-imprisoned in Vigil Keep where Anise buys his billet and then Season 2 happens.
---
Funny thing, if you look at one of the most popular game currently, Fortnite (exlcuding everything bad happening with how they treat their game and the Epic game launcher contreversy), one thing they did right was no gambling for skins, and they only sell skins and battlepasses that give you skins and other things, none of which are gambled for and you now what you get in advance, even if they use a fake scarcity shop, it works, they made  2.4 billions $ in revenue in 2018 only. So this thing ArenaNet does is just lazy easy money. Of course Fortnite is way more popular and on every platform (pc, mobile, consoles) but even being on mobile and no pay2notwait or gambling shows that it can be done.
---
I love how you very subtly change Canach's hairstyle between the first three and the second three flashbacks from curved to spikey to reflect Canach's own appearance change..
---

To be fair, if you can't do any of the story instances solo, then you have a "git gud" problem.
---
At what point do you feel accomplished to complete something successfully if you aren't even challenged in the first place?
---
What kind of environment were you brought up in to be that way?
---
50 times /gg to get that one easy starting mechanic.. Oh that horror.. I disliked the old "let's start with swamp" meta so much. Don't even like that damn fractal anyway, it was really annoying to go through multiple loading screens, so you can start with a fractal you didn't want in the first place, because it's "the easiest".
---
It isnt really important, but if you sand swell out of the small circle while the Insta-kill happens you can live if the attack is past the place you are sand swelling to.  This weekend when I did CM I accidently ported out of the circle and didnt die but the attack was past me when I came out of the sand swell.
---
Hit "Y" key, the icons on the side should have looking for group option. Rest is pretty easy to do. :)
---
&gt;and how many actually raid in this game
---
I can't tell you because I don't know, hence why I avoid pulling random numbers out of my imagination.
---
lfg&gt;dungeons&gt;ascalonian catacombs
---
but dungeons are pretty much dead content, we have instead fractals
---
If you are doing fractals, just buy 20 slot bags for 150 relics each. That's the best way imo.
---
Then unlock all bag slots and there u go. 200 slots is more than enough.
---

25 black lion keys would give you at a minimum 25 black lion statuettes. With 25 of those you could get quite some nice stuffs. But I suppose we ignore that?
---
I would pay real money for a short expansion to live in alternate tyria for a single mission or so.
---
As others have said, there is a tool for it in the game that the default key for is "Y". There will be a list of group  descriptions, some notes for this:
---
Dungeons are split into seperate modes and paths:
---
* Modes are either story or exp (explorable). Story is generally your first play through, explorable is where the rewards are usually higher but the difficulty increases a bit.
---
* Explorable modes are separated by path. Paths are named either by number or shorthand names (1/2/3, fw/aether...) 
---
So a description for a dungeon may be:
---
`exp 1` or even just `1`
---
I would add that if you join one of these groups make sure you join one that has a description that fits your needs. Joining a group that says `all welcome` or something like that is best, you could even join and ask if it's ok that it's your first time. This will hopefully stop you running into any toxicity due to being new to the game. Better yet, start your own group stating that it's your first time and enjoy it at your own pace.
---
Good luck, have fun!

in case u didnt see the raid lfg 90% of it are raid sellers and 2 or 3 pugs with ridiculous amount of kp

Condi scourge is a good pug carry though. Don't dismiss  having a condi scourge ready unless you're doing fractals with a static.

---
People who complain that (cosmetic) lootboxes exist because there are people who easily fall victim to gambling must also want knifes to be banned from IKEA because everyone potential murderer could go on a ham with them.
---
I partially agree and partially disagree, but my agreement is related to my disagreement.
---
I think that generally speaking people who play solo do so because of their real life personality and the same applies to those who group up. People who naturally have in life a more shy or introverted personality are going to play solo much of the time and people who are more outgoing or inclined to socializing in real life will tend to find groups in game.
---
Now here's the thing: the people who are more inclined to socializing are also more inclined to join and be engaged in guilds and so they are going to be grouping up - but this means that much or most of the time they're grouping up with people in their guilds. 
---
In other words, the majority of people who are socially inclined to group up are already sort of "out of the ecosystem" as far as group content goes. They already have their groups. They may use LFG or chat to group up if they want a group during an off hour of the day, but otherwise they're set. 
---
Meanwhile the players who aren't in guilds tend to be players who prefer solo play anyways because it's just their personality. They might look for a group if they really need one for whatever reason, but otherwise they aren't grouping because they just don't want one.
---
There are exceptions to these general rules, of course. There always are. The point is that *generally* speaking people who would want groups already have them in guilds or groups of friends or whatever and people who don't have guilds or friends or whatever generally don't want groups anyways.
---
I'm one of those solo type players. I play other games with more refined and versatile LFG systems, but I don't use them in those games, either, because my reason for avoiding them isn't whether they're easy or hard to use, but it's the whole social interaction thing that comes with playing in a group. I will say that there is nothing about more advanced LFG systems that I think makes a real difference from what GW2's doesn't already do for me. GW2's system really is not hard or complicated or annoying to use in any way. It is very easy to use when I do want to use it. 
---
Actually, the time's I really use it are as follows:
---
* When I am trying to join an active map for a meta event
---
* When I am trying to make a legendary and need dungeon currency
---
There's a common thread here: these are both situations which don't really involve social interaction. Map switching for meta events obviously involves just joining a large group, swapping maps, and leaving the group. Meanwhile, dungeons are so old and understood at this point that nobody talks or really interacts at all: you join the group, you go in, you do the dungeon in 10 minutes, and you quit with the only real chance of interaction being if people say "thanks for group" or something when you're done. Heck, nobody even really talks to say, "ready to start?" or, "should we wait for the 5th guy?" Whatever players load in first usually just start making their way through the dungeon and when later players join they catch up. E.g., if you use LFG to do AC chances are when you load in half your group is already at the Spider Queen. 
---
The only thing I'd really agree with is that the way the LFG tool works makes it more difficult for a lot of more solo inclined people because instead of just having something like a checkbox to choose what content the group is doing or what role the group needs, you actually type out what you're doing and this means that players will put requirements in "exotic gear please" or "know the fights or whatever" and that can make some people nervous about the social dynamics they're getting involved with. If anything, I would feel more comfortable with a less versatile system which had no player input but just sortof coldly put you in a group for a given content.

Can't wait for the next raid wing in 2021, can't wait for it to be cleared in 17 minutes. Thank God Anet doesn't cater to filthy casuals with additional difficulties, their one-size-fits-all is everything a GW2 pro raider needs to be happy!
---
Because they often pug and while not all raid sellers are particularly great a good number of them are. So you'd probably rather be in a pug with good players than bad ones?
---
This might be my favorite....for now :)
---
It being random would mean the possibility to just get stomped by RNG... Sounds not very fun to me. IMO this kind of Randomness should be limited as much as possible.
---
Oh gosh... sounds nice but... slipperly slope and birds flashbacks  :O
---
&gt; To get it you have to complete every path of every dungeon. 
---
So in other words, [Dungeon Master](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dungeons_%28achievements%29).
---
&gt;One way to get tons of people on dungeons for a long long time
---
Most accounts would have it done instantly given the achievement for that act already exists.
---
what you are describing is effectively instabilities... which already do not work well in the mode they were designed for.
---
additionally you suggest literal RNG mechanics of the highest degree. rng in this game is already well overdone. with these instabilities getting randomized on each separate try, even the hardcore guild - those this should ultimately be attractive for - will get tired of it in no time.
---
repeatable CMs on the other hand might scratch some of that itch.
---
I hear the OP is a toxic elitist c;
---
If you want to try ele, just try it!  The animations don't change much between races for the same profession.
---
I wish he reacted to our Springers.
---
And then you get the dredge one anyway
---
Anise makes more sense, I wasnt around for ls1, but I heard canach was in jail in LA at some point before ls2 so I assumed that was before rather than after the start of ls2
---
Tell that to the raiders that fight tooth and nail against additional difficulties. They seem to have to enjoy what they have.
---
Only trouble is that it's soulbound rather than account bound.
---
Keep this in mind before equipping it.
---
Why did they move the bunny heart, I got a huge mandela effect type thing for a moment thinking it was a female heart quest giver until I read this and it really was
---
&gt; The argument was that ArenaNet can't direct their game
---
The problem is that they CAN, they don't WANNA to, because they are scared of losing profit, which may not happen
---
&gt; they are not paying the bills
---
Questionable because raiders actually play this game after they finished story, while casuals (ppl who log once every 3-4 month for LWS episode) are not. So, casuals do not drop money in this game, while ppl who actually play game sometimes do this. Not every raiders reach AF to allow gem conversion for 2k gem skin which they can demonstrate in raids.
---
&gt; combo fields and combo finisher were because it was such a feature that was never explaine
---
fun fact. It's totally useless feature for 99% situations. Exceptions is might stacking in solo. 
---
&gt; this didn't made you brainless either.
---
Well, if i just do something without trying to understand what i do - it does makes me brainless. It's not like I always understood what to do in game. Hell, in my first MMO - SWTOR i had mix between tank\dps skill tree, because had no idea about proper role of dps. But BEFORE going to raids i actually read google about it. I learned rotation. I learned how fight works in theory.
---
nowadays? if you just want to get new things that require them maybe 50 or a little more should be enough.
---
this would make the System look so much better for potential Players. 
---
They way it is now it Looks like a cheap trick
---
I like how we all agree that the commander is a human female
---
Hullo friend!  
---
I am sorry this has been your experience, it is something I have noticed, and to be honest I am quite surprised at the comments telling you that people don't deserve to be rezzed.
---
Personally, I will always go out of my way to rez anyone I see down (even full-down, even when I'm in combat to do it, even during a boss). I keep an eye on my minimap for just such a purpose!
---
In game, I am often found commanding meta events or bounty trains, so if you ever see me (Tempest Antura), be sure to join in! When I wear a tag, I always keep a healer build, because I believe everyone has more fun when they're alive! No White Flags \[DIDO\] means never leaving someone in the dust!
---
hatred that I am fine with :D
---
I dont own that many, just few full stacks and some shiny ones :D
---
This build is 100% the most OP open world build in the entire game.  Sustain, tanky, crazy damage even while completely solo, great burst CC, and an amazing downstate.  Plus, you can swap to more defensive traits for even more lifesteal and defensive tools if you need them.
---
It’s only drawback is that a *very* small number of fights totally break minions. But even without minions, you can make reaper super tanky.
---
i've opened mayhe 50 chests in the 4 months i've been playing and from those i've gotten: the humming bird skimmer skin, 3 branded weapons from claim tickets, leather and metal housing nodes, an endless repair contract, the white wings back item through a wardrobe unlock, that one glider that looks like a wreath, a fuck ton of crafting supplies, and about 500 dungeon currency. 
---
i sold all the housing nodes and the repair contract and now i have a decent amount of liquid gold in-game.
---
there are decent drops sometimes, but they're never good enough to spend real money on them. it would be a much better deal to just sit on the gems until something you like shows up in the store.
---
mmh well, I'm sorry if I'm dragging this matter, lol. But to my experience, leveling up gives enough rewards on its own to make leveling up possible.
---
Do you mind if I write a checklist with stuff you might be missing? 
---
* Personal Story rewards. You get a couple chapters of personal story to complete every 10 levels, which gives you decent equipment of the level of the story. For that reason, it's advised to complete it as soon as you unlock it.
---
* Hearts vendors. This one kind of suck at lower levels but from 30 and beyond, depending on the heart, you get actually nice weapons and armor sets from them. Once you complete a heart, the heart npc becomes a vendor that trades items for karma. Could be trinkets, gizmos, weapons or armor. I've seen some lvl 30 or 40 hearts offering decent masterwork (green) weapons and armor for around 2k karma.
---
* If anything else fails, you can always buy from the trading post. Leveling armor is usually cheap.
---
Use the gw2efficiency.com currency feature. It will tell you what’s the best value for laurels.
---
bright mood, not bright of mind
---
It's a male charr
---
If they pug then I'm assuming they are joining the group of a pug commander that I've not blocked in which case I'll end up in the same group as them anyway (which has happened plenty of times before).
---
How often do you actually join a pug group and it turns out to be bad? The vast majority of the ones I join are competent enough to get easy kills (especially with off meta healers being more accepted now).
---
I think it's because Evon collaborate with Zommoros and all merchants. They switch weapons with their smaller counterparts using bank.also, they set up same price for both smaller and bigger version literally earning more on whole Asura race. They are also responsible for clipping on norns to make sure less people will gear up those big meat bags.
---
*bows* Thankyou kind sir/madam!
---
The same like in pve. You have to be in party/squad for that to even happen.
---
Ah I see.
---
As far as I know, if you're not in a party or squad, then that's not possible.
---
Gotcha. Maybe I just haven't come across the higher ones then. Im level 32 and still in the few 1-15 and 15-25 areas clearing them out lol
---
I mean, most group comps are arranged around boss mechanics. So if you randomly change a boss's mechanics multiple times throughout the fight, it will completely invalidate having group comps, requiring you to plan for every possible contingency. If you have bad luck, you have to just /gg , because several mechanics rely on having a particular build or comp.
---
For example, you are fighting Dhuum, where condi Renegade shines. However, he has sloth's hibernate mechanic, meaning that he goes invulnerable every 20% or so, effectively requiring Condi dps to start all over again, and slowing the fight down dramatically. At 66% he picks up Matthias's machinegun mechanic, meaning you need at least one person to bring feedback, which they wouldn't ordinarily think of doing on Dhuum. Then, at 33%, he picks up Deimos's hand and/or oil mechanics. I hope you thought to bring a handkiter. Soulsplit and running to greens should be fun.
---
This sounds less reliant on skill and ability to adapt, and more reliant on simple dumb luck.
---
Good to know I'm already on the site but havent used that much
---
yes
---
In OW, the need for Signet of Ether is kinda low. And phantasms are only relevant in non-core-Tyria content.
---
Weren't they added back with a vendor who changes map based on a schedule?
---
There's also a sound effect.
---
I haven't seen this posted yet so ill mention it..
---
I like everyone else has 1 invisible bag for things I don't want to lose. spare armor and trinkets and weapon sets. put 1 of each type of unidentified gear in invis bag or shared slot, this will keep you from accidently salvaging it when you select salvage all option on the copper fed.
---
Mistlock Sanctuary permanent pass I keep this in a shared slot and is one of the most qql items in the game. it teleports you to an area of the game that has everything. it has crafting stations and merchants, mystic forge and vendor, fractal vendors and access to fractal lobby, bank and guild banks, black lion merchants, its also the only place that allows you to teleport to the exact spot you left when going there.
---
this item in a shared slot is one of the best qql items in the game. it makes all your bank and material storage upgrades that much better. being in a shared slot means every character on your account has access to it. this item is not always in the gem store.. I imagine it will be in the gem shop during the august anniversary sales.
---
Just take off your armor and runes if you want more of a challenge.
---
to me I would say yes.. buy the game..esp if you find a sale where it has both expansions on sale for 50% off or more, keep checking the official site and official retailers for codes, DO NOY BUY CODES from a non official site, this can put your account at risk.
---
the reason I say yes.. is it sounds like you really enjoy the game your problem is a social one, and this is easily fixed.
---
this game allows everyone to be in 5 guilds at once so you can really join guilds that cater to your needs. I really enjoy all playstyles of this game, so I'm in a pve(meta and world boss guild), a fractal guild, a pvp guild, a wvw guild, I even use to be in a guild that would max out drytop on Fridays. there are also guilds that cater to new players, they can be very helpful with answering questions about other systems to the game, I know your lvl 80 now but once you get the expansions a lot is going to open up  to you, so much it might feel overwhelming at first, a guild that advises new players might help with this.
---
don't worry about joining the wrong guilds, if your schedules don't line up you can always leave and find another, find guilds that cater to your needs and schedules, join a few at first and drop the ones that don't offer you anything.
---
Buy a commander tag, make as many runs as you want.
---
If you do this after tuesday, many veterans will join anyway.
---
Does it auto join you to a squad when you zone in? I looked and I wasn't in a squad. That's why that message kept confusing me.
---
The Unbound Magic equivalent is the [Magic-Warped Packet](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic-Warped_Packet) and the [Magic-Warped Bundle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic-Warped_Bundle)
---
The champion/legendary status doesn't really mean anything. It just comes down to the individual mob. Some veterans are arguably tougher than some champions or even some legendary mobs.
---
I'll keep an eye out for that Mistlock Pass then. I already have the desert one though, I believe...or at least one of the things that lets me go to a similar place instantly.
---
As for having the unidentified gear to prevent the salvage all thing from salvaging things, can you elaborate? It can't auto salvage exotic/ascended gear...
---
how about any time you played a video game with rng loot drops. RNG is great when your lucky and shit every other time, its how it works in every single video game. You paid gold/cash to roll the rng dice hoping to get lucky, you got exactly what you paid for.
---
&gt;Permanent finishers can also be sold on to for upto 50g
---
I could have bought a handful of gems and converted that into 50 gold.
---
&gt; i've opened mayhe 50 chests in the 4 months...
---
RNJesus blessed you friend.

I have 6462 laurels and 18 million karma :O

chinese server is leaking into reddit
---
This game would do a lot better if Raid difficulties were introduced. Easy mode for casuals, Hard mode for not; all the same rewards for both and maybe a title for the hard one.
---
This has been happening with many bosses and often you can't even properly ground target skills near them.
---
I like the new weapons because they look more understated and different in silhouettes rather than excessively flashy! I just hope it doesn't wind up costing 150 ectos, because I need all of mine for legendary crafting and I can't afford to throw down that many on a single skin lol
---
I'm currently burning off my laurel stash for legendary shards. Better value than t6 mats and those shards are a 1k gold wall per legendary.
---
Bad luck, I opened 5 not too long ago and got a perma makeover kit in one of them.
---
Yeah, while guardian fits paladin thematically, in terms of mechanics Paladin is far too tanky. A cleric subclass that doesn’t grant heavy armor proficiency might more appropriately represent how squishy guardians are.
---
Some sweetened Bloodstone dust, but only a little!
---
Yeah, while guardian fits paladin thematically, in terms of mechanics Paladin are way way tankier. 
---
A cleric subclass that doesn’t grant heavy armor proficiency might better represent how squishy guardians are, haha
---
Oh wow, what a marvelous cosplayer! Ty for sharing, she just got a new follower!  
---
In some pictures I can definitely see the resemblance, especially in the eyes and eyebrows area :D
---
I love my Rifle Deadeye, definitely my favorite class/specialization.
---
He's triggered the final cookout...
---
There's no stopping it ....
---
As posted on another reply, Fractals scales you to 80, so the level difference in terms of actually hitting the enemy does not matter.
---
Some context: I sometimes to a key train at Dragonfall which averages at around 60-65 keys from the whole meta, which means that for few days I can just join endgame meta maps and open chests without doing the 45-1h pre-meta. I usually get messages like this after each meta, but this one was really nicely written!
---
Blue circles in the ground. They're really, really noticeable. 
---
Drop all your settings to low and then put them back up to what they were at. Sometimes helps when stuff doesn't appear.
---
What you are talking about are completely different things.
---
This is not a coherent thought or point. You seem confused about your own point that you are apparently trying to make.
---
The issue isn’t PHIW, it’s this hyper-entitled mentality that ‘everyone should tolerate me being deadweight because I insist on playing grossly off-meta builds that do not benefit the group at all and everyone must accept that otherwise they’re toxic elitists’. 
---
I like to call them toxic casuals.
---
you know you're supposed to save your keys for when a 2000 gem mount skin is in the chests? /or anything else BLC exclusive that you want.
---
More accurately, they were going back-and-forth on that position. When The Lost Shores came out, they said it was post-Zhaitan, but when they officially began the living world, they said it was happening "whenever you are in the PS" and had such a statement specifically with TA's revamp. But they also said that the Tequatl revamp was post-Zhaitan when releasing that, too, and that Teq's power boost was because of Zhaitan's death.
---
The whole of the LW was officially post-PS not with S2, but rather with the Battle for LA: Aftermath which had Pact troops show up (but react to the PC based on PS progression).
---
And the Pact's existence wasn't truly contradictory - since it was "designed to fight the Elder Dragons, not other threats" as mentioned in LWS1's epilogue. What was most contradictory was Destiny's Edge returning home, as they said at the end of the PS as they (specifically Logan) said they'd stick with the Pact until all ED are dead. Yet they showed up at home with zero explanation for why. Of course there were other issues.
---
There is a huge difference between commanders and some bloke popping his tag. The latter rarely get letters like you did.
---
In na, it is absolutely true. Even defining "Most" as "80% of the day" it's still true.
---
Heard EU isn't as bad.
---
Exp usually refers to “experienced” whilst ‘expl’ is used for ‘explorable’. That you’ve given a path with 1,2,3 further renders using ‘exp’ in the context you described redundant.
---
hmm, like to give a shout out to infinite horizon mirage staff build: i was able to solo most HoT skill point champs with it, something most of my other proffs were not able to do. and as others stated, nerco is also a great choice as well.
---
No, I play GW2 every day. I love the game. I played another game today and something in it reminded me of Taimi and I shared it. If that bothers you, downvote it and carry on. :)
---
&gt; "challenge the audience's structuralist expectations."
---
Well yes, that was the idea behind most of the game's design at release. Things like level scaling, dynamic events, lack of vertical progression, and no holy trinity classes were features that were wildly different from the typical WoW-clone you'd see throughout the 2000s. One of the biggest aims of GW2 was to shake things up and provide an MMO experience that was significantly different from everyone else in 2012.
---
No, this is not a troll. This is way too much effort for a troll.
---
He/she just didn't want to risk their internet points on their "main" account...cause internet points matter a lot to a lot of people.
---
&gt; hardcore casuals
---
that's.. new
---
&gt; the key is to train your players
---
You can't train them unless you give them reason to train. And Anet don't give them a reason to train. There only press 1 and do full rotation with meta gear. Or get hard cared.
---
&gt; But what do you think the raiding community would do when they have can't have everything anymore?!
---
I guess you missed my point. The only fields that actually affect gameplay is fire fields, which are limited to few classes. All other fields like...no needed?
---
&gt;  how do you know they are not the same which I said with "they don't know any better"
---
Because i knew it? Like come on. BEFORE doing hi-end I actually used braincells. It's not like i was told BY GAME, I did it myself. 
---
&gt;  You surely didn't know any better
---
I did? Like come on, ofc it wasn't like "Oh, yes, i need this build". It was "Hm, that's hi-end coming, i need to know what is going on there".
---
&gt; If they play raids, I totally agree but this is not the majority of players that play GW2.
---
And we came to egg and chicken problem. If there is not enough content for raiders - there will be less raiders, but if there is less raiders, why create content for them?
---
i wish you wouldn't have posted either way
---
Both thief specs are good for open world, they just have different playstyles
---
Reaper is generally the best at open worlding as it has good survivability, isn't super reliant on others for boons, and has good cleave. Scourge is also fine, but you'll likely take a little longer to kill stuff and are a little more squishy.
---
Most of your survivability in this game comes from actively dodging and mitigating damage though, so make sure to practice that and then you can survive any of the expansion content even on a glass cannon sorta build
---
Necro, is way easier. Especially as minionmaster u can solo everything.
---
&gt; Are they all downvoted to zero by people that like the current gambling
---
Yes. WE LIKE GAMBLING
---
ah yeah I forgot it's usually "expl" not "exp", I didn't really explicitly state that it was sometimes dropped in my  example. I've edited it to match, thanks :)
---
I call bs. Alone the fear of getting banned removes most of those lfgs.
---
I can kinda hear it, but only when her voice is filtered through comms like that :)
---
Yes. But it is not separate in Gw2. I was proposing adding a casual difficulty to raids with the same rewards (an easy-mode VG for example) while giving those who clear the "normal" version a title or something to preserve the prestige of clearing without excluding casuals who just want to play what they want.
---
I use laurel's to buy ascended recipes now, karma can buy you your first set of exotics if you have no gold, after that I use karma to buy the volatile magic picks/axes/harvesters, you get a little bit of volatile magic each harvest so you can later convert it to gold
---
&gt;Sadly more then half of these may not work after map change/re-loging.
---
When you have infusions of equal priority (Mystic, Phospho, Winter's Heart - or the Polysaturating and Polyreverberating), place your first one on a trinket (sans legendary trinkets) and your second on armor/weapons.
---
When you load into maps, your gear doesn't load at once, and whichever is loaded last will be the one which shows up - similar to applying last, basically. Gear without visuals load faster, so those infusions will be "applied" / load up faster and the overlapping effects will go away when the other infusion loads.
---
In addition to the wiki:

* Aiyinmaiden appears to be continuing her long history of content/guide creation [here](https://www.ayinmaiden.com/mapachievements)
---
* /u/tgdm has made a few guides recently
---
* Sadly, the only other content creator I know of, Fizmatix seems to have shifted his web presennce, so his stuff is no longer linkable (though it may apear on archive.org, haven't checked.) Leadexample.net was the website.
---
&gt;If you win, they're forced to accept living in yours.
---
The difference is that I'm not enforcing my opinion with the threat of them being thrown in jail.
---
I'm not saying "Buy loot boxes or I will have the police arrest you", but they are saying "Don't sell loot boxes or I will have the police arrest you."
---
Their ideas restrict freedom, whereas my ideas increase freedom. In my world, if you don't like loot boxes, you can simply not buy them. In their world, if you like loot boxes, you don't get to enjoy them.
---
I hope you can infer that this is not just about something as petty as loot boxes, but about the very concept of personal liberty and personal responsibility. I believe that "I have vast freedom, but I am responsible for the consequences of my choices" is a more empowering philosophy for humanity than "People cannot be trusted to be responsible with free choice, therefore we must take away those freedoms so that they don't make a mistake."
---
The logical consequence of the latter idea is literally slavery, if you simply apply that idea to everything.
---
Rata Sum home instance *still* has mucked-up stairs in it that make you jump over the top step' as a bonus, if you stand in the wrong spot while harvesting the Garden, it'll yeet you off the platform and out of the instance (as a bonus, when you get back in the instance, you can no longer harvest from the Garden for that day).

I play how I want.
---
By that I mean I choose which of the meta DPS builds I get to play and don't expect me to be weaver.
---
Was about to say "poor thief", but Ive lost my sympathy for thieves last time I played x). By thieves who actually had custom builds. As much as it infuriated me, Ive gotta admit it worked like a charm haha.
---
And yeah, fun is a major factor indeed! ^^
---
&gt;thanks for your answer :)
---
I for one really loved the feel of the Long Live The Lich trailer. 
---
The music was dope. The visuals were crisp. The gameplay shown was brief but on point, it looked good and conveyed exactly what was meant to be conveyed. And the Joko parts sort of felt high-value also, because you realized it was cut this way for the trailer itself.
---
That said, my ideal standard trailer would be a combination of the gameplay presentation in the Long Live The Lich trailer and the cutscenes in the trailers of All Or Nothing and War Eternal. 
---
So, one part gameplay presentation, and one part that takes you directly into the story and hypes you up for where the plot goes next.
---
A skilled and charming commander leading a meta party can seriously set the tone for an entire map full of people's enjoyment of the game. It's actually one of the things that really blows my mind about GW2, that it's managed to attract and cultivate people like you who enjoy and are good at leading people through meta events, where in other games the equivalent of mentor or commander tags is usually just abused.
---
I need to start doing fractals (and raids). I'm only do open world content/meta events and sometimes dungeons.
---
Most groups on NA just put P1/2/3 depending on what explorable path they intend to do, or have story if they want to do the story path.
---
all bags slots are expensive for me (Im Brazilian and $1 cost me &gt;R$3,85)
---
While the Bug in the System one had that nice song and ambience and the great detail with the portrait, it can't beat Nolan North voicing Joko and presenting the rollerbeetle by breaking a wall and doing an air trick.
---
https://youtu.be/KTPesFa1xm8
---
I didnt know that, thanks for the tip
---
I'll try that this night
---
I saw the comment and I wanted to reply too!
---
I would like it if we could unlock more... life?  In the guild halls.  Be it a small upgrade to add ambient creatures (killable or not, I do not care) and more npcs for idle chatter in the hall.)
---
I would also like if we could have an actual Guild Bank Area with more upgrades to add more slots to the guild bank.  My guild is pretty much me + 10 or so IRL friends that don't play as often as me but love fashion wars.  So I tend to keep extra copies of exotics, minis and recipes so that they can unlock them on their accounts when they do random 4-mth spurts.  But I also have excess Scribing materials and WvW blueprints in the guild bank for other guild-related stuff so the extra storage would be a huge help in ensuring I can help my friends.  Not to mention the Gilded Hollow has an actual VAULT THAT YOU CAN WALK INTO, but it isn't upgraded to be YOUR ACTUAL VAULT which seems silly to me haha!
---
Another upgrade I would like would definitely be more merchants in the merchant area.  While I would absolutely love a BLTP NPC there, I would also greatly appreciate basic crafting merchants for cooking, jeweler, weapon crafting, armor crafting, etc.  So that way it's easier to help guildies find an NPC that has the new sigil/rune recipes + the inscriptions/insignias needed for basic crafting.  An Icy Runestone merchant and other misc items used that are scattered around Tyria would also be nice to unlock in the guild hall, even if that means I have to donate 10 Icy Runestones to get the partially corrupted Norn to show up and hide in my hall.
---
Another feature that I would appreciate in halls is adding additional portals to the Guild Portal, especially an upgrade with PoF points like Crystal Oasis.
---
Speaking of PoF, it would be cool to have a mount stable as a new building in all of the guild halls.  It could be used for guildies that currently do not have access to mounts (do not own PoF) to play with them in the guild hall.  You can currently rent a mount during Wintersday and Halloween for the mount races, so if guild members could "rent" a mount from the stable to run around the guild hall, I think it would be an interesting way for some of my guildies to try how they feel before committing to the expansion.  Not to mention this would also add a new NPC for ambient dialogue and more "animals" to make the guild hall feel more alive.
---
:( it feels so lonely in the guild hall when you are by yourself at 1am.... though I do at least have Sweet Sweet Steve's voice to keep me company.  Yum.
---
Jesus, someone’s salty...
---
This is something I’d really like to learn how to do! Unfortunately I don’t know if I’m charismatic enough to come off as helpful and funny, rather than just annoying. Those who can command are just awesome. (I’ve done lots of RIBA and appreciate commanders there for sure.)
---
Most heroes from Western epics really.
---
while I have a permanent mystic forge in my inventory, i would love to unlock a Mystic Forge as well as all of the holiday varients that Lion's Arch gets for decoration purposes as well as functionality.
---
Raids already have casual difficulty as default in at least half of the wings.
---
I tend to aim to spend limited currencies as stingily as possible.
---
Laurels? Almost never spend them myself, yes it's hoarding to a degree but nearly everything I might buy with them can be picked up for other more easily obtained currencies.
---
To be fair I also have a lot of characters, so I can farm a cropton of berries fairly quickly so I tend to get most trinkets this way, having few or only one toon does push you to more maps due to daily limits.
---
Plus I tend to lean spending a bit more gold to avoid spending such things, for example I'd rather buy ascended armor recipes from the TP and craft those and them swap to my goal stat rather than keep buying new recipes over and over with laurels (which okay I don't craft much ascended because I consider it a waste when I can craft grandmaster marks and get ascended armor via WvW that functions as precursers to legendary armor, as long as I don't forge it to new stats so it does have that limitation of being only the one stat until it's actually legendary, but I consider it worth it)
---
Fractal materials used to infuse rings, because I don't fractal a ton I rarely have enough to do an infuse so I try to always infuse bloodstone bands from Bloodstone Fen because they can be stat reset, I think the Mist Bands from PvP/WvW might be good alternatives (they come infused and are NOT unique so you can also just get two from there) as they can also be reset (the reset should be bought from the PvP vendor though as the stack of shards of glory is currently 1.9g vs the ~18g for a stack of memories of battle). I notice it does say limited to central Tyria and HoT but I'm not sure if that's just text that predates the stat selectable gear change from a few weeks ago.
---
It is indeed such messages that keep a commander motivated.  I've been a WvW commander off and on since just after the launch of the game.  Yet such messages are the the heart of what drives this game;  I believe this is the core of the game.  Playing together!
---
Do a combination of all of the above?  Farm mosaics by doing metas and getting the hero chests and doing bounties.  Farm contracts by parking alts at the Tomb of Primeval Kings and opening the chests. Do the hearts when you have the time for it.
---
And I will sit upon my throne (since that's been the 100% achievement reward for the last two wings) and laugh.
---
I was attracted to GW2 because it's less like an MMO than other MMOs, still allowing a mix of solo casual play and spontaneous community interaction without any commitment. I do enjoy group play, but on friendlier and less demanding terms.
---
I've tried other MMOs, including WoW and Eve Online for several years, and found them to be either disappointing or requiring too much commitment. In my case (and I suspect I'm not alone in this) there's nothing fun about playing a game that acts like a second job.
---
Nah I wanted something that fits my necro and trident was the only thing that did :D
---
You could get them through the monthly achieves , before they had log-in rewards. Regardless, 6400 sounds like an impossible number. they've only been in game for like 6 years. At around 50-60 per month + the small amount from achieves.
---
This isn't true anymore, DH benches higher than core

---
I think it’s an overstatement to say that it’s necessary.  Some players like and need to gradually learn the game, but many others find core Tyria too easy, not rewarding, and a waste of time.
---
I think it’s generally a good idea to play Core Tyria for a bit to get the gist of the game, but you understand the base mechanics and want a challenge before burning 40-80 hours leveling for the first time, it’s worth just boosting through it.
---
If it was always the right answer to level instead of boost, ArenaNet wouldn’t give free boosts with the purchase of each expansion.
---
Thank you for doing this!  I’ve been playing for a while but I’m not great, so I love it when someone takes the lead. I really appreciate it when commanders tell me what’s going on/how to play the event. I’ve been yelled at a lot playing events I was new to and didn’t know how to do correctly, so I always appreciate when someone takes the time to explain!

It has nothing to do with pathing, it's the mounts hitbox. I went to the location and it seems the slope goes a bit into the top floor which then the mount hitbox registers but because it's too high it doesn't hit the curved bottom of it and it prevents you from moving forward.
---
ahahahah 8 year old me powerlevelling my Charizard FEELS this comment
---
You earned the "Archaeologist" title IRL.
---
That's only relevant in lower level play. If you do daily t4+cm, the groups are generally competent. And if you're not, basically anything works.
---
Sure they should be, but so should bunch of forgotten maps such as kormirs library or glints lair or the city in Istan. So many big maps and detailed places only used once and forgotten after. Raid maps are utilized a bit better
---
I bet you expected this to go colefast, but it went... *coleslow*.
---
The HoT raids (Spirit Vale, Bastion of the Penitent, etc.) sort of tied into the other PvE plotlines revolving around the White Mantle and such, but I never felt that playing them was in any way required to understand what was going on in the LW releases or open world. They did definitely have connections though, and added some depth to what was happening in the LW.
---
However, the PoF raids seem to be almost entirely their own side stories to my knowledge. Some ties to Elona in the form of djinn and jackal portals, but the story of the raids doesn't really have anything to do with Balthazar, Aurene, or any other important story beats from this LW season.
---
Even when they belong to the same dynamic event...
---
In short. Yes and no. They touch at some points.  Like LS3 and White Mantles..
---
Just wanted to say that the raid had a lot of fun with more emphasis on mechanics. Well done .
---
they're more of a side stories with some hints about them in open world and things that tie them up like white mantle in living world season 3 and first 4 wings but while you play in a raid you're not *the commander* from your personal story, but a squad doing a side job
---
How do you move with those keybinds?
---
A separate daily reward for dungeons would be nice. There's little incentive to do dungeons when t4s/cms are so much more rewarding for the time it takes.
---
What stops you from training them? Thats how i got my gf into casual raiding. Tag up, slap a build on them and tell them what to do and how to improve.
---
Ever notice how anyone to ever post about MMOs on Reddit was the “Best X” or pioneered something in game, all completely unverifiable?
---
probably partially?  but daredevil will be WAY easier to survive in PoF than core thief.  and either Reaper or Scourge will be WAY easier to survive than core Necro.
---
Thanks for sharing that I wasn't playing during that time. Only during the first couple months of release.
---
Yes! Thank you!
---
Yeah running with pugs is probably a waste of time
---
What is that book?
---
And since I'm here, there's a central thread for all the recipes found so far? Asking for a friend.
---
No
---
Was actually thinking about the guild halls when I read the title. With them I always get the idea.. hmm such a cool map too bad we do nothing with it. So yea id say any map could be reused.
---
Not to mention Adina, trying to give boons as a chrono or heal your allies as a druid was so obnoxious.
---
Dungeons which is old 5 man end game content, now abandoned by devs but still fairly used for leveling up, farming some gold/currency (used in crafting later).
---
Fractals (5 man) which have scaling difficulty including some challenge modes on certain fractals. Great daily content that has pretty good rewards and challenging enough content.
---
Raids (10 man) which is supposed to be the most challenging part of pve, but some encounters are pretty trivial. There's currently 7 wings with 3-4 bosses each (some have events instead of a boss) and about half of them have a 1-time challenge mode that gives additional rewards.
---
Of course there's open world maps that usually have a map-wide meta event that requires a bit of coordination.
---
There's no auto groups, but there's LFG. Open world maps have different instances (for example 1 map can have 10 instances), so if your current map seems empty, you can join another one through LFG or by being in group with someone.
---
They're side stories but cool stories nonetheless you should watch on youtube or experience for yourself. In W4 we have one of the biggest mysteries solved, Saul D'Alessio. In W5 you meed Dhuum, and a pretty interesting thing happens there that might be explored in future stories, and in W6 you get to visit the Mystic Forge. And ofc in this W7, another prominent GW1 story, the Hidden city of Adashim. 
---
So while side stories, not relevant to the main story, they are pretty interesting stories, usually with a high level of detail. Lots of books / interactable objects and lots of dialog too.
---
If you care about GW lore, you should certainly watch / experience them.
---
Not only raid maps should have a story mode, story maps should have an Dungeon mode. 
---
Take Fahranur, the First City. Wodnerful map, tragically underused with a single story instance.
---
Story mode for raids would have the same exact mechanics, just with much more lenient damage and HP in bosses with the exception of the most dangerous and most telegraphed attacks that would remain sure kills. In exchange there would be no raid currency rewards and no account bound RNG drops. Only normal drops like unid gear, and very, very rare tradable raid drops since those can be obtained in TP anyways.
---
Dungeon mode for story would have the same bosses with with scaling for 5 players and higher damage, but with dialogs cut out or skippable by walking past dialog points. No waits by closed doors. 
---
By merging the concepts of story and dungeon/raids, we can have both repeatable engaging and varied content, and a way to experience just the story with a more laidback experience.
---
More than twice the content for less than twice the work.
---
Charisma is the result of a good con, it does not make you a good commander.
---
I was as charismatic as a 2x4 when I did dragon stand at the start, but I learned my line well. I was fast and efficient at it. So people filled. My squad and my. Map in minutes when I popped up.
---
The talkative and charismatic commander happened because I had great people with me that did the meta with me repetitively that brought it out. They were great people to lead and they made me charismatic.
---
Don't focus on that. Focus on being a good commander who gets the most loot and the fastest run. You'll be loved by default.
---
Then as person above me said, either learn raids or explore cleared raid instances. There's plenty of opportunity already. Dont be lazy.
---
Another great idea!  I’ve taken advantage of many a portal.
---
Wasd with macro mouse maybe
---
They kinda did it with migraine achievement, too bad it's a 1-time "content" and something that they never did again.
---
Ah, so I wasn't crazy. Mostly.
---
And once again, GW2 baffles me with pure wholesomeness
---
Haha after doing that mistake and having my Charizard violently disobey me I am NOT doing that again.
---
Same! 
---
Crap, how'd I manage to get it placed there? Crap, I did it again! Holy crap, I'm playing so badly today!
---
Like, every time it would happen, I thought I did it
---
I believe his strafe is set to A &amp; D instead of Q &amp; E. You don't actually need the 'turn left' and 'right' binds at all to play effectively. Tbh I've actually found combat more efficient and rewarding unbinding the turn keys and just using strafe.
---
...raids *are* PvE content?
---
In my opinion, it'd be dumber if they'd delayed the release of the expansion another month or so just to get that sort of minor side content (and the fourth Dragon's Stand lane, and other stuff people get annoyed about) built for us. It's not a pleasant call to make, but stuff happens and things end up having to be cancelled.
---
One thing to keep in mind is that a lot of raid boss mechanics are programmed as character models, especially in w6 and 7 so its best to keep this on at least medium or attacks will be invisible.
---
Now that explains a lot...
---
This is so cool I had no idea! And it’s so funny too haha it feels like avengers and terminator.
---
My mistake was I thought this was supposed to be a friendly community where people with a shared interest in GW2 related stuff could share. But I didn't look close enough and didn't realize it was yet another haven for elitist jerks to shit on people who don't meet their personal content standards.  But now I know. I'll leave you to it.
---
As a rank 175 Bronze invader, take my advice with a grain of salt, but Metabattle build *is* your solid base. They provide builds for general group comps (and a great example of said types of ideal group comps) in their WvW page. The thing is, you should pay attention to the alternative skills they provide for each build. Pay attention to what other classes you are running with in your squad subgroup. For example, if you are one of two medkit scrappers, but no support firebrand, you might want to consider swapping one of your utility skills for Elixir B to provide group stability, even though the Metabattle build does not run that at default. In general though, skill swapping is fairly minimal for Zerg builds, because chances are you will have enough people to cover the basics.
---
Solo roaming builds are where it gets a lot more tricky. Metabattle does have roaming builds too, but they won't always work out well. Sometimes you can be straight up hard-countered by someone else's build. You will typically be swapping skills as you go based upon the fights you get into. Everyone has their own silver bullet, find yours and use it. Don't forget, synergy between your skills is important.

&gt;As we prepare for world restructuring in World vs. World, we’ll be removing language restrictions in the upcoming EU world links. This will help us create fairer links and gather data on the impact of grouping together players who speak different languages.

lmao so the mmo population site uses the subreddit for data, but got the subreddit flare title mixed up with that game? Does the site use multiple sources for player data and info? I wonder how it got the total player and active player counts, but measures game activity as a decrease, and the number it uses seems to be the number of active ppl on the subreddit right now, so is it not actually the number of ppl in game?
---

---
Yeah he asked for me. I'm curious too... :)
---
The support builds, at least on metabattle, are pretty updated. At worst, the new "updates" to them are already listed as possible variants on the main listed build.
---
To be fair, they started doing that before we even knew the actual name of the boss.
---
Why not?

Hi guys. I've had my 3d printer for a while now and I've been wondering if anyone knows how I can rip the 3d model of my Guild Wars 2 character so that I can make a 3d print of it. =D
---
cool error u got there
---
Thanks alot for your input, even as a 175 bronze invader ;3
---
Part of the gameplay intent of raids is that you don't get to see them unless you can beat them. It's part of the reward for the challenge. 
---
So non-raiding people are explicitly meant to miss out on them. It's not an oversight; it's a feature.
---
If you have pvp'd a lot maybe you should be able to make legendary armor. Also would make swapping it out very easy.
---
Balthazar CM at the end of PoF would have been really fun.
---
Awesome! A good commander is a godsend. I remember one time in Dragon's Stand Meta, our group was wiping out at one of the pods and our current commander doesn't say anything and just kept going around killing the tenders. When we told him we need to reset, he got pissed and told us off. Finally he dropped the commander tag after telling us to do it our-self, another Commander took up the responsibility and do a reset, while explaining carefully what we should do. We got organized, did the pod event successfully, and took down Modremoth. That second Commander literally saved the map from failing, and we thank him profusely. He's also very chill about it too.
---
Haha! Basically, I do use WASD with action camera alongside a special mod called ICM. I can't go back. I used to play BDO and it definitely feels similar in terms of movement. 
---
When it comes to other keybindings, I use all the letters that are close to WASD and don't require weird finger positions..especially F1-4 keys which either twist my finger a bit or are too far in general. By using this set up I can move and use skills at the same times more easily and also since the distance is shorter..it takes less time to activate..milliseconds..but still faster.
---
Also, I don't strafe since it's not usually effective and I would usually also have S keybinded to a heal or something..since backpedalling is also usually not as effective..but w/e.
---
It's all preference at the end of the day.
---
And one more neat thing why I use ICM..I can remove the pesky textures that block the view for no reason. (a clear example is the skills background texture or mounts background texture). Literally what you see in the photo is what my screen looks like..if I press CTRL it shows the other things that are usually there by default.
---
they made it shorter (like scepter length) + purple-ish flames
---
Sounds like a good way to get ice-9.
---
\*sobs in FFXIV\*
---
cut it in half now.
---
ty dude, i always use your vids as a resource to find out what i want to spend my gold on
---
If I remember correctly: mostly light purple, dark purple, pink, respectively. But it depends on the dye - there are some blue dyes that shift green instead of purple. You'll want high contrast dyes to counter the purple/pink shift. You can get the shift to be lime green with dyes like Carnage Orange, for example.
---
All to them. That way, the people that want to hard content do it because they want to not because there is a carrot on a stick.
---
Lmao you're so full of shit, well good luck, I'm done with this.  Glad they wont be changing the chests anytime soon since none of it is legal gambling.  I guess you'll have to live with your hypocrisy of enjoying a little gambling but not a lot and of course "a lot" is something you make up and demand everyone else adhere too lol.  I hope they add in even more rng just to make you uncomfortable.
---
&gt;We've given the gaming industry over twenty years to show they can be responsible with lootboxes.
---
You've *given* them? So their freedom to create and sell a product is a gift that you can rescind?
---
If I think the drivel that pours out of your comments is bad for society, do I get to rescind your freedoms too?
---
&gt; You're just a voice naively arguing in favor of them being able to exploit us as hard as they want.
---
Your argument is that you are so incredibly irresponsible and lacking in impulse control and intelligence, that as soon as a company offers you the chance to gamble and waste your money, you have no choice but to do it.
---
Otherwise there is no world in which offering something optional for people to buy can be called "exploitation".
---
&gt; chaining the hands of a malicious wild beast 
---
Your dehumanization of video game studio employees in order to justify restricting their freedoms is a weak attempt at an appeal to emotion.
---
&gt;PS: Fuck right on out of here with that slippery-slope "regulating lootboxes is tantamount to literal slavery" strawman BS.
---
If only you could understand something called a principle.
---
"I don't like \[thing\] therefore I should be allowed to ban \[thing\]" is how you end up with no freedoms at all, because for everything you do in life is something that someone else wants to ban.
---
I would love to ban you from commenting stupid bullshit on the internet ever again. That would really improve society a lot! Your comments are wild beasts of misinformation and delusion that must be chained up so as not to harm our children! *Won't someone think of the children!?*

if you right click a salvage kit and then pick a tier type you will salvage all gear of that type in your bags, it will even salvage unidentified gear if its not in a shared or invisible bag. it doesn't happen as much since the mf nerf to unidentified gear but it still does upgrade you should identify before salvage.
---
On the contrary, because this game doesn’t have gear progression, I’d argue it is a better reason to have the same rewards. Games like FFXIV get away with something like 490 gear score for casual play and 500 (max for this example) for high level rewards but that is not possible in GW2
---
Idk but I hope it stays as long if not longer than WoW. It's so fun, I'd hate to be booted off
---
There was never a 4th lane in Dragon's Stand, it's a baseless rumor. There's three lanes, one for each previous zone, and one for each Mordrem Guard commander.
---
The southern half of the map is used for a story instance, and the northern half has no lane shape whatsoever, probably intended for another story instance or some bonus events.
---
I think the prospect of low quality design (such as which we've seen in Ahdashim) worries me more than seeing it locked behind a raid.
