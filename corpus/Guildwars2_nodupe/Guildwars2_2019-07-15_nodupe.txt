The answer still applies. Why force yourself to play a game you don't enjoy anymore? Find a new hobby and come back when you're ready to play again.

---
Nope thats only possible with gw2hook. And tbh it's not that much of a difference. I used gw2hook for that purpose only for a long time but it's worth switching now imho
---
* Fighting Aurene would be completely out of character for Zojja.  
---
She worked alonside Snaff and Glint. They were comrades. They were allies. Losing snaff hit her harder than losing Glint, but she also felt the loss. Killing her daughter would be unthinkable.  
---
And she would not be uninformed of recent developments. Taimi's science records are sounds. She would have all the data.  
---
* As much as I'd like to see the missing Malyck story finally done, I don't think they'll go back there. Ideally it would have been a 5th map in HoT, but they ran out of time. I'd want to have S1 before going back to that.  
---
* About Cantha we can only dream. I would personally love to see several Kaineng city maps, full of skyscrappers, slums and sewers as far as the eye can see, like in the artwork. Reminiscent of massive cities like in Blade Runner and the Fifth Element, and even Coruscant in Star Wars.  
---
 * https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kaineng_City#Gallery  
---
 * And of course Echoval revived, full of giant trees.  
---
 * Maybe we could even get a new "Grappling Hook" mastery to use between the buildings and the trees. It could be equipped as a new type of "Tool" novelty. And then combine it with gliding to go [Batman](https://youtu.be/DJB__LxxYMo) on this thing.
---
* As for Joko, my dream way to get him back permanently would be making him part of Halloween.
---
 * For example, they could have a 3rd Halloween Side Story. We have the one about compiling the Mad Memoires back, so the one about sealing the Bloody Prince would return, and they would add a third one in which we go to the Land of the Lost, capture Joko's soul, trap him in a device provided by the a servant of the Mad King, and bring it to the Mad Realm. From them on, every year Joko would return in Halloween alonside the Mad King, and he would try to escape and we'd keep him from running away so he gets trapped in the Mad Realm again for another year.
---
True but it's been many years since it shut, also the server code is floating around meaning literally anyone could host they're own server. Characters are also backed up
---
There's no reason right now. You'd just be repeating the same content you've already done for years. Wait until they bring out something new or exciting that you want to jump into and do on your own volition.
---

---
I doubt you have any goals to set to do, unless you are an achievement hunter or working towards legendaries everything else boils down to some variation of farming money. 
---
Some people continue to play it for the dead WvW and PvP. Raid LFG and statics/discords are bleeding players. Fractals are losing quality players. Open world is doing okay it seems. Many are waiting for season 5 announcement to see whether it'll be a GW2 2.0 moment or a steady decline towards maintenance mode.
---
Okay, so...let me see if I got this right, because that was definitely a mouthful.
---
* Sometimes you just get screwed over and that’s okay,
---
* Analyze the enemy before you engage,
---
* Shiny people are dangerous,
---
* Get the mount (working on that next!),
---
* Use the terrain to your advantage,
---
* Pick builds that won’t get you screwed (because of course I play reaper and berserker),
---
* Practice, and
---
* Stay aware at all times.
---
That’s a lot to take in, but...it sounds like in general, more foresight and some planning will work to my advantage.
---
No they don't. They tried to get the rest of the charr to worship them after they failed with the Titans, but the Hero and the rest of the EoTN crew stopped them.
---
God, it's been a long time since I played EotN. Good catch.
---
Yeah you're totally right, when people talk about grind they often forget that they don't HAVE to grind for it. To enjoy the basic gameplay there is not really a grind. I mean the entire genre is about progressing you character by putting some effort in a mechanic that allows you to do so (which could be seen as grind). You can grind for sure but whenever I hear someone complaing about grind in Gw2 I just roll my eyes.
---
This is not about me, it's about the lack of competitiveness and engagement of this community as a whole because of Anet's philosophies and decisions.
---
It's a game focused on pleasing casuals above anything else and that's why end-game suffers.
---
How about they fix fucking engis and mesmers in pvp before they worry about new stats.
---
There’s a (hopefully) full list [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_transformations_with_combat_skills) (under “Ability to use regular skills”). There are two different Watchknight tonics, a Miniature and Embiggening Tonic and the Fury and Chaos tonics from Fractals in addition to what others have mentioned.
---
Personally I think if GW2 is to survive long term, the next expansion needs to be a standalone story unrelated to the Elder Dragons.  There are a few reasons why this is important:
---
Firstly, this is so that you could market the expansion as a “jumping on point” for new players.  The problem with MMOs is that potential new players often don’t want to grind for a couple of months to get to the “good part of the game”.  For example to get to Path of Fire (which has the best story/features so far) you’d have to play through the vanilla storyline, Heart of Thorns and 3 seasons of Living Story.  This would take months to do.  Additionally Heart of Thorns and Living Story cost extra and aren’t bundled with the Path of Fire expansion.  More often than not, new players reach the one of the expansions not realising Living Story exists and costs money.  
---
Secondly the Elder Dragons story has “run its course”.  There’s only so many directions you can take the current storyline, particularly when the lead villains are a force of nature and have minimal personality and motivations.  Prior to big twist at Kralk’s death, the Elder Dragons ate/destroy things because “reasons”.  Heck it’s yet to be revealed where the Elder Dragons came from and this storyline has been around since GW1 Eye of the North which was released in 2007 (12 years). 
---
Thirdly MMO’s thrive on taking risks and trying something new.  The reason why WoW has survived for so long is that each expansion strives to have different story and gameplay.  For example in the Burning Crusade expansion you were battling Demons whereas in the Wrath of the Lich King expansion you were battling undead.  Compare this to GW2 where every season/expansion outside of Path of Fire had you battling dragons.   
---
Lastly MMOs thrive on world building.  If every map is the same (overrun by dragon minions and bandits/criminals) then everything is essentially the same, there is no world building.  World building can ever be achieved by delivering a diverse range of content in game.
---
Afaik, the instant level 80 boost is unmoveable. So you can't just put it on bank.
---
yes time but definitely not as long as skyscale
---
While Aurene was abel to help to absorb the magic from Kralk's death and can very likely help the magic levels in the world over time, it's still and issue currently. Even though Aurene is an Elder Dragon, it doesn't mean that she can just instantly hoover it all up at once. Like all the Elder Dragons have made massive army's of mindless slaves to help them siphon magic. Aurene I don't see her just making armies worth of mindless slaves to keep bringing her magic. Like her morality, while is a good thing for the people living on Tyria, is also a bad thing for efficiency. If that makes sense.
---
Jackal mounts are made from the remnants of Margonites, so one could argue that they are demonic, if not outright demons.
---
True dat. Reaper still puts up huge numbers and both are like high risk/reward with that big damage. Yeah keep your head (mouse) on a swivel.
---
...and before anyone gets on me about rank, High rank (plat, mithril etc) doesn't necessarily = good at 1v1 or 2v1. It could just be that they live in a zerg therefore a high rank. 
---
I've definitely underestimated some bronze people/lowbies. It could be that they are pro sPvP people and rarely come into WvW. 
---
But yeah, if you want to try the cheesiest solo roaming build that will give you a good chance at nearly any fight, a condi mirage is an easy class (but can be expensive to gear). Just get some clones, dodge and press 1. Repeat until dead. Press buttons and you'll most likely win unless they are severely anti-condi.

---
Not my cabbages....oh wait.. .wrong thing ... *Walks away*
---
Yes there are big differences due to the build system of sPvP (normalised stats, limited and somewhat unique set of runes/sigils to choose from, etc.) and the different type of fights you'll get, etc. But when you're at the stage of learning mechanics, sPvP is still the best way to get consistent and fair fights.
---
Foo.
---
I used whatever I needed to get the achievements I wanted and sold the rest.
---
Why?
---
Wrappers like this cant leverage dx12 benefits like multithreaded drawcalls, all it does is decrease performance further in most cases.
---
well it will be something like that but I want it to be something more than that
---
I would rather Gw2 to steer away from Elder Dragons. Joko was amazing. We need more of that. Intent, political power, solid motivations.
---
Current Shared Inventory Slots: Copper-Fed, Runecrfter, Silver-Fed, Mistlock, S3 Tome, S4 Tome, Spearmarshal Pleae, PCUIG, PUIG, PRUIG, Pick Swap, Axe Swap, Sickle Swap, Fireworks, Position Rewinder, Brandstone Multitool, Korna Turret Kits.
---
If i buy 5 more Shared Slots any recommendations one what I don't have covered?
---
It's literal garbage, why are you even thinking about it?
---
I'm just trying to maximize my profit with what I've got. I just dont wanna hold on to things too long and end up losing profit you know.
---
&gt; He also got the inquest chair glider thing out shortly after this, that was a sight to see
---
Funny story, I was determined to get the Inquest chair and glider after I get home from work. Logged into Mistlock and a few obnoxious players were gliding with the chairs using the spider tonic. Now I'm completely turned off from buying the set. 
---
So thank you obnoxious players for saving me 900 gems! XD
---
So in that case, I’ll need a whole new build for sPVP...that’s good to know. Thank you so much!
---
This made me actually laugh out loud 😅
---
**Dragons** are larger than **drakes**, but smaller than wyverns. **Dragons** have a longer body and throat than **drakes**. Wyverns are four-limb creatures (one pair of legs and one pair of wings), **drakes** are six-limb creatures just like the **dragon** (one pair of wings and two pair of legs).

One of the backpacks and armour sets we didn’t pick, a dye from some of the pallets that were released 6-18 months ago, a level 60 boost, and some karma.
---
Isn’t the movie based on it? I just watched the movie, didn’t play the game.

So bad that it’s good

Gw2's main draw for me is the combat. What works for me is that I take a semi break from GW2 and play a casual game (Hidden Folks is awesome ya'll!). Pretty soon I'll be back doing fractals for the fast paced combat.
---
The birthday gifts is a big deal to loose, especially if he had his account for many years. If he reset his characters it starts over from year one and shit gifts for two years. I would never delete my characters not even on my alt account. I rather farm gold to exchange to gems to be able to move.
---
Ice drake Shyvana

probably not: any special glider or mountskin dedicated to birthday. would be cool tho.

What about Steve?
---
Doesn't reshade reload the shaders at every map change? I couldn't use it for that reason, it's too annoying
---
Even if it ended the transformation, I would really like this change.
---
They did take a crack at a harder dungeon here and there. Flame and Frost brought the Molten Foundry (now split into 2 fractals), and Twilight Aetherpath was another.
---
The thing you see is people would rarely run these. Aetherpath was a pain to get a group for very quickly after it released.
---
Gw2 does episodic content between expansions. Usually 1 map and a couple of story quests. Think of these like mini-expansions.
---
I’m expecting a glowing variant of the luminous armor for some reasons, or maybe a chair?
---
1. Get the AP.
---
2. Hoard the rest for next year.
---
Dragon Bash is a recurring automated festival now.  
---
Proof of that is that it got a 50/1000AP achievement like other recurring festivals.
---
It may get new rewards and changes in the dragon coffer every year, but all we have now should return next year in one way or another.
---
I'm imagining diving pods being dragged through the seas by [supercavitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercavitation) rockets on cables.
---
No wonder he has crippling depression and started to bleed himself...
---
Wtf why is it one per account?
---
Or two level 10 ones, then 2 level 20, 2 level 30, and so on.
---
In that case the post seems beyond stupid and selfish. Why aren’t all 18 specs viable in blobbing? Why aren’t all 27?
---
We already have one and his name is Braham.
---
Not a decent balance patch, or build loader/editor. What we will get, most likely trash dye set, some crap mini, or a really derpy mount skin to play into more of Fashion Wars 2.
---
The biggest problem with that is the damage dispersion that those clones would create. You can only cleaves 3 or 5 enemies with skills. So if you buff clones and phatasms to a point that they are really hard to cleave you can deny an Zerg AoE burst only with clones+phantasm.
---
And if they start doing it for Mesmer they will need to do the same with Necro minion, Ranger pet, Engie Turret...
---
I can't decide whether or not this comment is more fitting of r/justneckbeardthings or perhaps r/iamverysmart
---
Aura effect, maybe_
---
I picked the least useful for me, because I thought I’d get another from my other characters. I didn’t...
---
This is better than GW2Hook unless you are already running at 60 FPS. 
---
Or if you value appearance over performance. I love good graphics but I need a solid 60 first.
---
I only ever saw that happen when I launched the game. Seems like yours was set up weird or something.
---
Obligatory "ctrl + Shift + H to remove UI for screenshots"
---
Oh my god haha I think I did the same
---
Yes analyzing enemies is important and knowing what classes you struggle against are important. Learn the weapon skills of all of the classes.
---
If you see a scepter/dagger weaver coming at you, you know they are going for 1shot gank burst and are relatively glassy. If you see sword/dagger weaver, they are incredily tanky but not too much dps pressure if you kite them well.
---
Quick swap your utility skills depending on your enemies. If you see dagger/dagger thief with venom pre-buffs. Quick swap to some condi cleanses. Sometimes I can even get a trait change in before engaing.
---
Maws of torment still has a bug that causes the entire event to fail. It’s been in the game since pretty much PoF launch.  I’ve personally reported it upwards of 40 to 50 times over almost 2 years now. They. Just. Don’t. Give. A. Fuck. Most of the time.
---
I would say 90% of people will be happiest if they buy path of fire and use the included level 80 boost. 
---
Play path of fire. Get mounts. Then decide what you wanna do.
---
If only those could be exchanged into Spirit Shards... That'd be neato.
---
Who needs a flying bunny when you have a griffon :D.......nvm I want one.
---
they are purposely careful not to make it too good,
---
Same, switched all my gear and stuff to my ele. Feel your pain
---
Personnaly, Im happy with this Chrono change. I know it sound weirds and not a popular opinion but they make Chrono Shatters Impactfull and better than without Chrono spec like it should be with a shatter like CS. Now each shatters can be really impactfull and I actually love this idea. Long time ago, mesmer wasnt able to shatters without clones (it come from a trait and they remove the trait to make it mesmer mecanics) so it didnt shock me that they revert back this for chrono spec that have access to CS. Sure, it make it harder to abuse CS and traits that interract with shatters for Chrono Spec like we are use to be but we can still use them.
---
For WvW, in small scale/roaming you can still use all that without problem but in zerg you are back to the start before the traits that apply shatters effect around you. You will need to change a bit your gamestyle for zerg back again. Keep in mind that clones always spawn with the weapons you use. So using sword will not be good in zerg scenario because your clones will run into the enemies zerg cleave. With Scepter, Greatsword and Staff your clones will stay in range and they have better chance to stay alive for you to use them for shatters. Im pretty sure Scepter will became the main weapon for chrono in WvW.
---
I’m not even comfortable hoping that there *will* be a next living story / expansion.
---
Okay? I knew this and doesn't contradict anything I said. That skill affects the creatures made for Nightfall that serve in Abaddon's alliance of evil regardless of actual lore origins.
---
US has maybe three partial groups up at any given time ,_,
---
That would be way more useful, actually
---
Dyes, a level 70 scroll, karma envelope and probably some toy or choice of toy.
---
I'd be thankful for a t-shirt. Mordremoth could've had attacked anywhere but he chose to attack the Mother Tree in the Grove. At least it wasn't me...
---
No one here has a crystal ball to tell you the right thing to do, but consider the following:
---
1. People forget about the festiva items until about just before the festival by 1-2 months.
---
2. Festival items typically spike when people remember them just before a festival
---
3. This is the first time DB was re-introduced, so there is no other historical data to really use other than festival-bags from other festivals
---
4. Coffers are the only way a player can ‘buy’ Teq/Aurene ascended weapons and then it’s only though RNG.
---
Knowing that, you’ll need to think about and decide for yourself what the best choice is.
---
Watch your language.
---
The fact that this animation is STILL quoted to this day always puts a smile on my face!
---
Well depending on when you started hoarding you could have already lost profit. Then if you hoard for next year you have to store all the stuff somewhere for a whole year. My advice, unless you are seriously getting into the tp game sell(well list for the tiny bit extra).
---
Take a break, play something else - You'll come back when more content drops anyway and it'll feel fresh again
---
And to make low HP builds completely useless?
---
I wish there was a toggle for it.
---
Ancient eye-and-tentacles monsters, planets giving birth to god-beings and space travel is the baseline from which everything else was built in Warcraft. Pretty much every issue can be tracked down to either of those elements (or all).
---
What fog are you talking about?
---
I am using ReShade and can honestly say that I cannot remember seeing any fog anywhere.
---
If any of his chars are over a year old, I would not delete them. Contrary to what some people say here, they can be very valuable as you go on with the years. (amazing skins, dye colors, boosters ...)  
---
Transferring isn't that expensive. I'm sure you can raise enough gold together to convert to the required amount of gems. Don't throw away valuable older characters, it does not matter if they are low level. :)
---
We can see in-game, specifically the Hall of Chains, that nightmares are twisted souls of the dead.
---
Ghosts and spirits are not demons in GW lore. In GW's setting, demons are beings born from malevolent energies within the Mists. Since nightmares are technically "twisted souls of the dead" they're not demons.
---
Just save up for a server transfer, as everyone else mentioned starting over from scratch now may screw him over in the long run.
---
But but. The white mantle?
---
Regarding the dragon stuff, that's other settings, and not GW's setting. In GW, the only "true dragons" are those related to the Elder Dragons. There are "lesser dragons" which involve elementally attuned reptiles (wyverns, hydras, drakes, skyscales, etc.), but they're not "true dragons" in the setting like Aurene, Glint, Tequatl, Zhaitan, Kralkatorrik, etc.

[Unlimited gathering tools](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gathering_tool#Unlimited_Gathering_Tools) don't ever run out and if they have a [glyph](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_\(upgrade\)) in them (usually just the ones that come with them, not really worth it to buy with gold) then they get that bonus too. For instance you could have a set of [volatile magic tools](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infinite_Volatile_Magic_Gathering_Tools) (still the best glyph) but if you want to use them on multiple characters you need to swap them around. Some people like having slots open to do just that and move the tools to whatever character they are currently using and just put them back in the shared slots when they are done.
---
well prepare yourself, because core mesmers still can.  Only chronos are losing that ability.
---
Holo Broccoli
---
I still do them, the challenge is getting a group in lfg or running with friends in less than 5 because no one else want to join.
---
I seriously hate fractals, i did them, even some challenge mode ones, they're not funny, and when you do them in lfg, i've tried to do t1 or t2 ones just for fun in the last weeks, didnt work.
---
imho fractals are praised just because the dailies+high gold reward, if they ever did the same for dungeons, it would be better.
---
obviously, with tweaking their difficulty, bosses just melt because they weren't tune up for the power creep, they only added breakbars.
---
i bought my gift of ascalon with that currency exchange voucher from blc keys

The anniversary for GW2 will be next month. It always comes with huge sales. If you are not impatient, I would wait. You might be able to grab both expansion for the price of one or maybe even less :)   
---
I love both expansion btw. But if I had to choose, I would go with POF because of the mounts, and it's also the more relevant expansion that is a requirement to have for many new stuff in this season.
---
&gt;It's not very efficient but its pretty quick.
---
I'd argue the speed makes it efficient ;)
---
You could spend all day writing some crazy script to do it all automatically in a single pass but you'll still need to double-check and fix the weird stuff (like Headbutt in this one).
---
Thanks for sharing, I always enjoy seeing how other people do wiki-related stuff.
---
I don't think they will skip out on Dragon Bash next year. I fully believe they will either bring it back at some point depending on the direction of the story (Dragon Bash after a big dragon filled story/battle makes sense -- I am curious of how they'll handle it next year if we get a break from any Dragon threats)
---
It isn't spreading rumors - it's listing out the many possible scenarios one might run into when they decide to either save or sell their limited time items (and I gave plenty of options outside of that one, including waiting for next year's Bash). To me, the signs say it is coming back but for all we know they may drop it at a different time of year than the OP is prepared for. :)
---
Some people saved their Dragon bash items in 2013 and were stuck with them until now. I'd rather someone paint a full picture for me and let me come to a conclusion myself rather than just give me a glossed over answer. If someone isn't planning on playing this game weekly next year and paying attention to all of the news on when events may be starting up again (me literally with the Adventure Box event that I've missed 2-3 times already) then it may be in their best interest to make a short term plan for their stack of items filling up their *generous inventory!*
---
&gt;I think most of us would love to see dozens of small groups roaming around capping, defending, and scrapping with each other instead of these fucking blobs.
---
More variation is welcome to the gameplay in WvW if you ask me. But that also means there should still be a space for zergs and blob fights. Instead of straight out punishing one type of gameplay, what about finding ideas that would incentivize people to not just train over others? Right now, the best way to get rewards is through fights. All other rewards in the game mode is simply based on being active. 
---
Add more types of rewards to the gamemode. Maybe by winning each week? Make sure the reward is solid enough, that people would want it, over a week of lootbag farming. 
---
If people want to win and they can't win because their zerg is too small, maybe a ton of havoc squads will be more useful? 
---
I am not saying my few suggestions are what will make the change, but instead of punishing different ways of playing, find incentives for people to want to win and through that, people will hopefully adapt to using different kinds of tactics. Of course all of this also requires to have somewhat balanced populations.

I haven't even been to SW in ages, but I remember his voice way too well.
---
If you can't find joy anymore, then just take a break. I was in your shoes before and it really doesn't hurt to just make a break. That's where GW2 shines, all your gear will always stay relevant, you won't fall back and you'll come back to new content, ect.
---
&lt;3
---
alot of ppl say this but kralk isn't that deep in the water
---
Even if you did swipe that credit card to convert gems to a little gold. You would not "win " as the game has horizontal progression, meaning if you get ascended gear which is relatively easy to obtain, you won't get out geared by anyone as they offer the best stats in the game.

There's not much neck romancing involved in this pic
---
Depends on how fast you can raise 250 gold. Not everyone farms gold at the same rate. I actually preferred the skyscale collection as content to the griffon collection.  Both are doable either way, but I feel more connected to my skyscale because of the way the collection was handled than I did to my griffon.

Wow! Love it :D

Just trying out different traits might help you. If you need some inspiration try some builds from www.metabattle.com
---
As someone that is also subscribed to r/prequelmemes, this threw me for a loop.
---
Find someone willing to duel you and keep dueling him, after that go look for another class to duel and repeat
---
I knew that thing reminded me of something.
---
If you've already done it, you cannot repeat the personal "My Story" but you can join others doing theirs.  You cannot repeat season 1 but can recap by skimming or watching the Living World Season 1 movie on youtube.  Everything else is repeatable (minus the short prologue to HoT).
---
Wait, i have to buff Alacrity as Chrono?
---
Damn, i gotta tell my Alacrity-Rev.
---
+ Engi with his ~~spirits~~ turrets.
---
and also Kalla dips into the ritu aspects of the Revenant.
---
That's what is great for rev. Because of the legend-mechanic, things can switch up. Would like a more dervish-esque elite, altough I kind of see the herlad's facets as a kind of enchantment-loosing playstyle
---
Why take "lead the wind" when there's no longbow?
---
Nice sword!!
---
Play something that can escape.
---
*ALWAYS PLAY SOMETHING THAT CAN ESCAPE*
---
No point being able to 1v1 people when yu can't flee at immediate notice due to random 4 man ganks while yu duel.
---
Ideally yu also wanna solo take camps, so PvEing cleave is also good.
---
When yu have no choice but to fight outnumbered, always go for the lower ranked enemy.
---
A player of equal skill will stall yu, as long as possible, so yu should always kill the weaklings first and focus on the higher ranked target.
---
Know whether to stomp or bleed out/cleave when skirmishing group vs group.
---
This is especially important when fighting near an enemy waypoint and they can beat yu just by zombiying.
---
Sorry, but did I miss something?
---
Just an errant thought: That's not how you use "titular".
---
(Not directed at OP, but it's common mentality.)
---
Why does almost every person who didn't do raids think that all people would want to carry/teach them? Similar with wvw pugs asking for commanders, some of them would actually get angry when they see a closed guild raid or when there's no commanders at all.
---
Just because people have the ability to help you, doesn't mean that they have to. They don't benefit at all from it and do it at their own will.
---
Another point to add to your list: either you die a hero or you join the cancer builds.
---
Imagine being new for so long that you actually get good at it.
---
&gt; Why does almost every person who didn't do raids think that all people would want to carry/teach them?
---
Because that's literally the point of the guild.
---
Why would you join a guild if you have literally zero interest in playing with it's members?
---
There are literally guilds designed specifically for high end gameplay, join one of those.
---
" Some small/reasonable amount of gems to unlock "Greater teachings" and allow you to spec in any of the new 9 roles" I assumed by that you mean that in addition to LS chapter. Which means that if for example, I miss on the LS chapter, I need to buy that chapter AND the class spec.
---
All the HoT maps are designed in a way that you go through them first and return to them to finish them later. It is just us cheating around HPs and such that makes it straight rather than circle, but that's it, the initial intent was to come with story and then return to finish maps.
---
Well thats the reason i havent done raids. Its not beginner friendly at all.
---
Every time i tried I get shit on. So i just end up not playing.
---
And theres training groups too but they always schedule shit ahead of time and i dont always have time to play.
---
At least in fractals its more noob friendly because you can start at T1 and people are always willing to show newbies the ropes.
---
Reading a guide makes you ahead of 90% of the training group. I swear you can be more experienced than half of the people that do raids if you watched some videos of the raid and if you spent few hours with the training golem. Play a cookie cutter class, that synergyzes well with the rest of the group, and easy enough for you to focus on mechanics (DragonHunter is an excellent class with forgiving raid interaction (the heal makes you "immune" to gorse reflect for 6 seconds, the F3 blocks attacks and provide aegis if you need to block VG tp, you can always sacrifice a little bit of DPS to take some group stab if needed for Earth Djinn in W7 or to prevent the fear in Sloth, ...)
---
It may sounds bad/weird, but I honestly think that you shouldn't play what you like when you enter the raids, play an easy class, THEN, when you know the mechanics, play something you like, even if it's harder. There is NO class that isn't viable in raid (you won't reach Snowcrows level of DPS, and Snowcrows levels of DPS are only required for speedclears, not to simply kill the boss).
---
And to end up my wall of text, I'd advice to start by VG, the simplest, of by Cairn, which has several mechanics, but a very low DPS barrier entry (you need 4k dps per person, which is lower than what open world players do if their build is somewhat not totally randomly made)
---
To add to what people said - minions and pets _are_ still mostly utility, so there's no class that uses them as a primary damage source, but they are there.
---
Ill try it next time i can play.
---
I main ele and I don't really play anything else. But i can still dps and do rotations. Tho i may need to review that again after the last balance update.
---
Is Reaper any good and would their pets be good as well? I don't know if this game is the kind of game that refuses classes/builds toward the end or not.  
---
I also have a question about Mesmer too, they sound pretty neat but are they not really a pet class?
---
Honesty works best, the community is pretty good
---
Just say hey I'm new but I wanna learn and I know the important mechanics and I more or less know my class, can I join?
---
Good boi Raccoon
---
HoT won't be an issue since I got gifted that, will I need to hit a certain level to be able to use it though or can I just use it?
---
Ye! Happy fractals :)
---
Thank you for the suggestion :)
---
From what others have said I was under the impression that the Sylvari experience was like seeing the extended version of a movie with extra scenes, so I thought that playing only with Sylvari would be enough.
---
Are there any benefits to replaying the story with a different character other than seeing the story itself? For example will any achievements be unlocked? Any collections that require a 2nd playthrough?
---
Oh nice, thank you for the info, That's something I was a bit afraid of as well was if there were builds or anything that I wouldn't be able to use at the end because of "meta".  
---
With Ranger would I have to use Druid? I don't have any issues with going support at all but just in case I could fall back on anything else as insurance I suppose.
---
They are definitely not minions, and they don't even really "help you fight", outside of a specific few skills.
---
thank you
---
Ah I see, okay that's kind of interesting. Thank you for the info :D
---
My bad then. It seemed like you were complaining.
---
Ah interesting, Okay. Thank you for that, i'll go look more into them now :)
---
agreed. I miss the days when fights lasted longer than 3 seconds.   
---
Now with the stealth meta, the first team that can coordinate its opening bomb will win the fight.    
---
If anything, we need more survivability

Broccoli barons are at it again.
---
Most likely a chair/throne with the GW2 logo on top.
---
Chairs are not bound to expansion and the Novelty slot is available to everyone. An item like that doesn't diminuish the value of current thrones and they can always make better ones ( like the Birthday Finisher we got: it's cool but nothing overwhelmingly better than any other finisher ).

---
there you go OP. 100% critchance ezpz or ~97% without food.  
---
if you need range because you are not used to combat yet, fgs out, longbow in, same sigils.  
---
pets: rockgazelle to break defiance bars and either smokescale if you value the blindfield (which is great because enemys won't hit you) or black panther for max deeps.  
---
later you can take in soulbeast and use this build:

---
I think for pure pve the builds of Nike! are a bit better than raid or dungeon builds like the ones from the snow crows. The reasons are explained in his videos. For ranger try this one https://youtu.be/o9gqbi07aQI
---
crafting hot/pof stats is tricky so best bet is get the gear from these reward track [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero\_Weapon\_Reward\_Track](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero_Weapon_Reward_Track)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
and 
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant\_Armor\_Box](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_Armor_Box)  
---
They are good to do anyways since you need to unlock them for other skins too
---
Raids have 10 player limit so you cant play with everyone in the guild. And when you cant play with everyone it's usually a lot easier to do them with exp players because not everyone likes to waste their time.
---
The most common reason I see is having not enough free time daily to learn and commit to raiding. What makes you think that only people who didnt learn raids have those 2 free hours per day/week? People want to fit as many bosses in those 2 hours and bringing newbies doesnt help that.
---
There's plenty of other content to do with guild, just because you're in a guild doesnt mean that everyone in the guild has to bring you with them. As I said, it's their good will, not their obligation.
---
As primarily condi builds or support... pretty easy.
---
You might want to update your [listing at Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/) then. Quoting:
---
&gt;What are the requirements to raid with us?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;* At least one character geared with a meta build.
---
&gt;* We require ascended weapons &amp; trinkets and exotic (or better) armor, as well as correct food and utility.
---
&gt;* You should have basic knowledge of your class and some understanding of its role in a raid.
---
&gt;* Be able to listen on discord. Talking is not required, but it is encouraged.
---
&gt;* You must be able to read and write in english, as well as understand spoken english.
---
&gt;* Be online and ready for squad invite at least 15 minutes before the start of raids.
---
You must be very young. Every European at least knows Area 51
---
the guild knows youre noob, they tell you about the mechanics. if you die its not the end of the world because the rest can cover for you. 
---
getting carried through your first raids isnt a bad thing, you see the mechanics first hand, if you fuck up the guild will explain what happened (unlike "joining a guild of same raid experience" where nobody would know wtf even happened). i assume when youre in a guild you communicate with the guild mates, and if you dont know shit you ask them... thats what i did. i got carried through my first 2 weeks (just like everyone else, doesnt matter if its in training or in guild run) then i was ready for pugs. after 3 weeks i was full clearing w1-w4 with pugs. despite everyone here implying you need massive LI or KP...
---
More than a week ago = old content, too much effort, Anet doesn't care. They removed the achievements.
---
If you have 5 characters, it'll do for 45 weekly key farm
---
Sadly incentive 
---
&gt; to raise enough co-raiders so your groups in lfg can be always filled
---
is not enough. It is sad. Either Anet stops making raids altogether or they will have to come with similar solution, though. So nowadays there is probably bad situation but hopefully in future it will be different. As of now, it is not self-sustainable.
---
Yes, I really liked that feature in FFXIV when I played it. We'd probably need an easier difficulty for raids that is less stringent on composition for a similar LFG to be implemented but both of those would be very nice to have in GW2.
---
And a way to sell every item from leveling up for 1 copper.
---
Well, whilst you're not wrong about the dev process, there's more to it that that. Some achievements have been bugged for *years*. There are plenty of bugs that have been in the game *since launch*. If things get fixed, they get fixed within a patch or two. Beyond that, you're better off just accepting it's dead.
---
depends on size of your guild.
---
Also if you have limited time, find a static. otherwise you are already wasting ur time.
---
Well, you get more the following year.
---
I mean otherwise you would just get a little bit.
---
I can see many fellow commander giving many good tips, so thank you all for them :)  
---
My guild does do regular training runs. I just did this as a sort of meme, hehe.
---
No more fucking dragons goddamit, please. They weren't interesting 7 years ago and they aren't any better now. They are as boring as it gets and the formula of kill dragon -&gt; minor villain -&gt; kill dragon -&gt; minor villain -&gt; kill dra.. is boring af.
---
If S5 contnues this stale and predictable cycle of boredom I'm done with this game.
---
Shadow warrior?
---
Oh, I love that bug xD I got it in Lake Doric, and was flying everywhere on my raptor :D
---
Hmmm ok it is hard to tell without spoil but ok i say it this way, the thing that will be different is dialouge. Sylvari have some different dialouge and those they interact with have some as well in how they interact. Which means that none Sylvari get another dialouge because they are not Sylvari. Mind though it is not like you play a different story, i played through the story many times and the stories are the same but it is a bit different.
---
There is one achivement involved for being a sylvari. Again at one point there is a interaction that you can not make if you are not a Sylvari. It is litterally one line dialouge that give you the achivement but that is it.
---
To quote myself from an earlier comment:
---
Dungeons are a part of the world and they are immersive. When you start as a charr you are met with both Flame Legion forces and Ascalonian Ghosts in open world and personal story. CoF and AC both serve as the stronghold or the source of enemies you met throughout your adventures in your homeland and beyond. In them you get to fight with the factions' respective leaders and further explore the place after you clear the threat. From a lore standpoint, it is meaningful for the charr to defeat Flame Legion in their stronghold and to dispatch King Adelbern with the hopes of disorganising the Ascalonian Ghost forces.
---
Even though they borrow so much from historic events and have multiple stories, fractals do not feel like they are a part of the world. Only thing introducing you to them is a mail you receive when you are 80 and if you were there, a short living story from season 1. The premise is that you get to visit some parts of the mists to stabilize them, but only momentarily. These parts of the mists, or fractals, always repeat themselves in an endless cycle and even the NPCs greeting you are stuck in this loop. In short, you are not making any difference in fractals. It doesn't matter anything for your character, the NPC inside or the outside world that you are inside fractals.
---
Racial chair is my bet too. Or some other sort of novelty.
---
Ooh I see! Thank you!
---
Nah, condi scourge can use minions
---
How is using stealth an abuse of bugs?  
---
How is killing trash mobs fun after the 100th or 1000th time?
---
Whats so much fun about dungeons than fractals???
---
that's awesome
---
Well they kind of want you to buy multiple sets. Buying another set of tools still has the convenience value of not having to go through the hassle of moving them around all the time. i personally have a couple sets that I use on my main characters and my best setup on the character I use to farm my home and most nodes.
---
Joined a social guild with +40-60 on pretty much constantly, some1 invited for cm+t4 fast run etc.(always pugged and never had problems, ofc there's some brain farts for ppl, me including, so w.e.) as i never did guild fractals cuz i'm too lazy to gather peeps for static, so we did shatt.observ and wiped 6-8 times before i just asked if they knew what they did and they literally loled(tried to explain mechanics in short) and i did another 2 wipes before left the party while kindly asked them to learn mechanics before posting "fast run", i wouldn't mind helping if they asked for help, but they literally asked for full set and did nothing, iirc i had \~25% more dps as brs than the 2nd weaver and 3rd idk, i think we were only 2 actually having keyboards at that time. I understand you expect "friendship" in guilds from complete strangers, but going to do party content which means you're wasting not only yours, but other 4-9 people time is a really fucking shitty thing to do when you know nothing about the content you do but pretend to be and "prefer" experienced people to carry you when 1 player can easily wipe others because he's not pulling his weight. As for raids and new players, im pretty sure there's already a lot of negativity for how high people reqs are for newly players it's kind of funny now.
---
Here's a thought: 
---
Problem with dungeons is that nobody at arenanet knows how the code for dungeons works anymore because nobody is still around from when they were made. 
---
So why not, instead of touching the old code, make new dungeons, with new modern code, in the expansion maps and use those to introduce new stat types and new runes? 
---
HoT could've had dungeons that awarded token that you could spend on exotic vipers armour and weapons for example while retaining the fact that you'd still have to craft the insignias/ inscriptions if u wanted to stat change ascended armour/ weapons.
---
Could've also been a better way of bringing in things like leadership runes. People still run DS regardless of those so i doubt it would've impacted ppl returning to do DS.
---
I wish they would do this for future expacs.
---
Yeah, that works too.
---
there's a world of difference between mix and max settings, like if it was 2 games made 10+ years apart
---
The issue isnt small and big servers. 
---
The issue is this game has a huge majority of fairweather players who hate competition. Almost every matchup is regardless of population because the players only want to play when they are already winning.
---
Cant have competition with a playerbase that hates it.
---
It's sooo good. Downloaded, installed and enjoying it right now. It's great.
---
Transfers are a problem but not the reason every matchup is this lopsided.
---
Can confirm. This can easily be observed in Domain of Istan atop the Astralarium. The path isn't complete by the time it the rift respawn. Interacting again before then doesn't give the effect. Waiting till you see the path complete below you and then interacting again does.
---
That sounds pretty amazing lol but I imagine it's hard to be able to pull that off.
---
Isn't it still required for Vision?
---
Aetherpath is still kind of shitty because you need a very specific group composition to make the ooze part bearable.
---
Yeah I understand the need for actual places we can visit, thats why we have raids. And yes, raids being 10 man and being harder content makes them less accessible. Maybe easy mode raids would help with the issue in some way.
---
I was loking for some soulbeast build whit longbow.
---
But the problem is i only see mele build.
---
It's ok if i follow the meta builds?
---
Don't know about you, guys, but with this - my game has problems loading textures. They just pop right into my face as I go, doesn't even load my griffon, I ride on air lol.
---
did anet ever say that d912pxy is ok?  
---
no bam hammer ¡?
---
Tybalt, Introduction!

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Guildwars2) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Not really.  I have a 970, 16 gb of RAM and an i5  4690k and i didnt have really much for improvements since im already close typically to the cpu limits while playing this game.  In some cases it actually hurt the performance more than helped.  I would recommened holding off on using it for your setup for now.  GW2 is a very CPU intensive game already so anything to help optimize generally would be fine, sadly this adds some extra overhead that hinders those optimizations it gives for the setup i have.
---
&gt; According to common sense.
---
common sense doesn't say anything about boon uptime and what you think it should be.
---
Don't see that any more, too many problems so most of the raiders left. One that stayed recently asked if I wanted to get back into raiding, and when I said yes they responded that they couldn't invite me because of too many burned bridges in the guild. Like what the hell is wrong with you that you feel the need to rub it in that you won't raid with anyone in the guild anymore due to some other people in it burning bridges?
---
If the problem is that they don't survive long enough to even spam a skill button, then a small increase would already help. I'm not saying make them tank tons of skills. And they don't have to do anything for other classes, we are talking about making F-Skills completely unusable with the upcoming changes, thats different than having suboptimal builds.
---
I think you should play whatever you feel like playing? no class is really that bad right now that you should avoid it?
---
bumblebee tuna!
---
That's good!
---
&gt; male Charr lines have given me goosebumps
---
Now I really want to try Charr... Guess I 'll have to wait for the anniversary sale to buy several more character slots to try a bit of everything :)
---
You have 2 character slots, you can use one slot to try out classes. It just take finishing initial tutorial and getting level 3, then enter PvP lobby and try out full max-lvl builds there. You can rotate through all classes like that ans see which one you like.
---
If you like fast assasins, then thief might be just for you. It does not have cooldowns on weapon skills, but you have Initiative - basically energy to use skills, so you can use some repeatedly or use various, whatever you like. 
---
Mesmer is more oriented about magic , confusion, disguise, illusions, and such. 
---
For some basic tips - no need to rush. Be ready to give yourself your own goals. Game will suggest you only very few things what to do and will let you be in big world. It is up to you to actually decide where you go, what you do. Everything is rewarding so there is not really wrong way to play. listen to NPCs if it is your thing, they have so much to say about the world. There are hidden treasures that you need to parkour to, if you explore, you can find such (or there are ways how to get hinted towards them via achievement lists). If you don't know something, ask people around, or use ingame command **/wiki [stuff]** . You can even do **/wiki [shift click item in inventory]**, it will take you to wiki page about that item.
---
If you see blue healthbar, it means that enemy is preparing huge nuke. You can save your ass by denying it, but only crowd control skills do work on the blue bar - stuff like knockdowns, pushes, pulls, cripples, slows, chills, fear, and similar. If you manage to destroy blue health, the mob is knocked down and vulnerable for a while, take your opportunity to smash jhim hard!
---
Yellow health means that mob has barrier, basically it is temporary shield that you can either burst through via additional damage, or it usually fades away after few seconds.
---
Dodging, blocks, evades, positioning out of the hits is important, you are not supposed to survive taking direct hits here. At least not for long.
---
Open World PvE (what you'll be doing until lvl 80) can be played with basically anything and any build. It's not hard content.
---
I suggest you go for whatever you feel like trying first, when you learn more about professions, PvP, WvW, Fractals and Raids, you can make a more informed decision on what you will want to play
---
Yes, this is French patchnote and i not understand the future things for my Thief &amp; my Revenant... :-(
---
Sorry for my English
---
You are late to the party. Choose the other MMO or single player game. At this point any group content is abandoned or in the maintenance mode. GW2 have 2-3 releases a year that would last you 2 hours of mediocre story mode with 0 challenge and open world area with 0 challenge or incentive to join the group as well. GW2 is totally neglected game with 0 real development or communication from the developers.
---
&gt; I wish GW2 had something similar to that. 
---
I don't know how raids themselvess work in FF, but here it is much easier to do raids with 9 good people, rather than 9 good and 1 bad one. This situation would turn into typical raidselling scenario, you get one "buyer" (that can  be  literally buyer or just a freebie. Or someone's alternative/friend's account), you tell him to shut up and stay dead, you do raid for those additional rewards  (that if they are even worth it). Sounds good?
---
Plus the whole impersonal automatic lfg system only works with very easy content and wouldn't work at all with gw2's class/role system, unless if will be triggered by "raid leader", who will specify what compostion it will be looking for, will be able to kick those who dont fit and how is it even different at that  point.
---
Ah that sucks to hear about your friends quitting although the PvP thing is actually really cool, i'll absolutely give that a go asap and hopefully save some time.
---
Je suis un tour d'eiffel.
---
You ever tried reshade? If your PC can handle it (probably yes) you'll get a whole new experience.
---
Welcome to a Chronomancer's daily routine
---
hahaha. Congratulations
---
Why are you looking for longbow specifically? In PvE you want to be playing in melee because of how boons and buffs work. If you're playing solo go ahead and longbow but because your damage scales poorly at close range and you won't get buffs at long range you will do very low damage which is why builds favour melee or at least BEING in melee. 
---
Longbow is more of a pvp and wvw weapon for the reason that players unlike mobs will disengage or run at you where then and only then is it appropriate to longbow 4 point blank shot. If you EVER longbow 4 in PvE for the express purpose of "dps increase" without it being a break bar you are wrong and anyone who tells you otherwise has no clue.
---
While the patch tomorrow does hold some balance changes, none of them will affect pve in any significant manner.
---
Had nothing but positive experiences with Raid Academy!  Though I sometimes feel like the OCX/SEA evening time zones can be pretty quiet, every time I've asked for mentorship there and have received training on certain wings/bosses, it's been really helpful!  Big ol' helpful community!
---
Problem with dungeon is their legacy code. Anet can't even implement /gg without it causing problems. They are not going to touch that voodoo code with a stick, and why would they create *new* dungeons if they have Fractals which are superior in every way?
---
Buuuuuuuuut..........
---
How about *open* dungeons?
---
overall buffs to both
---
Keep playing and that issue will go away. It's something that you have to go through every time you install/re-install it, but it usually doesn't take too long to clear up.
---
Oh, oof okay, thank you for the heads up, I'll keep that in mind.
---
Necromancers totally have a classic MMO villain aesthetic and it amuses me to no end that they're a friendly, playable class.
---
Mesmer is a very cool class, but it's also changing with the balance patch in a couple of days. All the classes are. Which class is better or worse could depend on the type of content you're into.
---
You're still naive.
---
There is 0 benefit for creating or maintaining a healthy community. 0 benefit to leading. 0 benefit to competing in any way.
---
Most of the playerbase would rather do mindless ktrains than have difficult fights. In fact, almost every server will hard dodge and their pugs most definitely will. It's the pve playstyle. You do whatever you like m, get loot and win. Not winning? Surely you dont have enough people! And they go do something else. 
---
EB has a queue on every t1-t4 EU server at prime. How are the differences between groups still so huge? Again most players will not join if their group isnt winning. And when they are winning? Suddenly they have a true zoneblob.
---
The amount of players who want to play like this outnumber those who want competition so badly that what you propose CANNOT exist without ways to exclude large groups of players. You make a decent server and you'll quickly get thousands of fairweather players to follow you around, but only as and when they please. And they'll happily afk or backcap when you cant carry them.
---
In order to have healthy communities that dont die you need to exclude these players. After all they only serve to ensure competition CANNOT exist. 
---
Anet is too carebear to allow excluding players, ergo wvw is a circle ktrain mode because the population made it so. Have fun with rp'ing as an eotm hero.
---
Game is dominated by players that hate competition. Competition cannot exist.
---
Best you can do is play what you'd like because the game has an amazing single player RPG feeling to it which really helps immersion. If you are into end game raids and meta professions you can do that, but best experience is achieved IMO expecting to play multi-player Skyrim.
---
Also nice to see that the Karma letter doesn't scale. I can understand 5k Karma for 1st birthday but come on... 7 years in I could use 500k or something.
---
Bad Bot
---
That sounds really interesting tbh, although it wasn't what I was looking for i'm a little sold on it so I might look more into it as well.
---
Quoi?
---
No, it's just 99% of the collective time spent by players in the game mode
---
so you want a bunker build which is unkillable through stats, as if chrono bunker meta after hot wasn't enough already? i remember how the match was descided by who took a point first and then just bunkered it down until the end without any chance to get that point back.
---
This screams "ive bought tons of it at wvw mount anouncement and now i need to push demand and sell it". If it was so good, ppl would already abuse it. I guess you are one of the few that actually mount engage.
---
&gt; ~~insider~~ meme trading?
---
TIL Engineer skill *Laser's Edge* is *Lame laser* in french
---
I haven't tried that build , but I main scourge and it sounds like junk.
---
&gt; He doesn't do anything. It's a lot like the Pact assault on Mordremoth - all the action happens off-screen before we arrive.
---
...I feel like you just slept through like 2 or 3 episodes. Among other things, he directly attacks Amnoon and kills off a substantial portion of the ruling counsel right in front of us.
---
I've been running dragon stand for Legos and these last two days there's been a random dude that's pulling 50k DPS, and in the chaos I cannot find who.
---
What builds are doing this so I can jump on those easy heart of maguuma map comps? 
---
(I've been away from the game for about a yearish and last I remember it was deadeye but I heard that was nerfed a while ago)
---
Maybe it would be a good opportunity to peel back the insane amount of blocks, invuln, and evasion in the game. You seem to think that one change couldn’t be preceded by others.
---
But raids are not the same with small group content like dungeons and fractals. I personally don't enjoy doing coordinated PvE with 10 people, partly due to the time it takes to gather that many people, commander drama and it just feels more intimate and your gameplay feels more impactful in 5 man. Also, the fights in 5 man are usually designed to be faster paced and more frequent phasing. Finally, raid squads may require people to use voice chat often enough, and I don't really like listening to someone talking as I play or talking with people with my voice when I am actively playing.
---
 But if I play 5 man I must choose between up-to-date content that is detached from game world and content that is relevant to game world but is ancient and abandoned. Dungeons, if Anet keeps them updated, can therefore fill an important niche.
---
Well, Kekai Kotaki has made a ton of GW artwork. Many of the art he made for GW1 ended up as assets in GW2.
---
There's also Daniel Dociu and his son Horia Dociu, who is now the current art director.
---
The game wouldn't look like it does without them.
---
GW has a lot of [artistic talent](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Category:Artists) in there.
---
so you want a game which is descided on stats instead of skill?
---
We'll prolly get the same things from 6th bday + a chair
---

Phone art of my friends' characters. Fera, Jenka and Kraat are taking small break before continuing their shield and sword training.

Testing half-tones and gray scale for my (hopeful) comic. Also adjusting my own style to be more simple.

I want PlotTwist that Jormag isn't bad or All the Omadd Machine sheningans cleansed his magic madness if he had one like Kralk.
---
Awakened basically have their original souls shackled to their corpses, with a compulsion to obey Joko. The compulsion can be fought, but it's difficult.
---
The risen are just plain old corpses reanimated by Zhaitan's death magic. There's nothing in them beyond the last thing they were ordered to do, they're automatons. Even those assigned to decision making are stuck on last orders.
---
Sorry, I can't speak french. **Rev** will get some DPS (and utillity) nerfs in sPvP and generall PvE. He also get a fix to shiro movementspeed bugs and a little rework on two mallyx utillity skills. 
---
**Thief** get a rework on the trap skills. They're no longer trapps and you can activate them yourself (but they won't trigger on their own anymore). Most other changes on thief are basically small buffs to the sPvP meta build and I guess small nerfs to the condi thief builds (?).
---
I hope you understand my english.

Ps: Here's the GW2 wiki version of the future patch notes:

---
 I've just come back to the game after a very long break,what are the best farm routes/map train now?Is warrior power still a thing for group pve/solo content?Thanks for the help.
---
Oh look, a brand new account on this sub? With a condescending post? Man you really need a hobby
---
how about a guy with &lt; 100 hours in the game wont tell me what to do,
---
and think that you know things better than veterans of this game based on your anecdotal personal experiences in L2
---
Alright, assuming there is enough of an audience for dungeons (I would certainly play the new dungeons if we had any) and assuming Anet resumes development on dungeons, the development would be:
---
1). Reliable, that is, Anet can barely keep up the pace as it is with 2 fractals a year and a raid almost every year
---
2). Profitable, that is, would Dungeons justify the amount of work put into it. Would people play over and over again this new dungeon? If it comes with no armor sets and all that juicy stuff. 
---
Point number 1, unless they stop focusing so much on Living World (which I think would be the right thing to do), they would never make it. They would have to cut fractals or raids and I think that would cause a much bigger uproar.
---
Point number 2, maybe? If they make dungeons as rewarding as fractals, but that would involve a rework on existing ones (to justify the gold you're getting from that) but I'm not seeing that happening either.
---
Ultimately I would prefer if they continued their development on fractals, introducing more rewards (legendary armor for fractals, more cms, whatever) rather than split development to also do dungeons and ultimately hurting both communities due to the increased waiting time.
---
" that can even remotely be used in blobbing "
---
Say Hi to rangers - thieves - elementalists . These classes has been barely usefull in WVW for months... some even for years.
---
It's a concern I know but you should try (and this is just an advice) to see the entire picture except thinking just about mesmer. It's sad that there are less and less classes usefull in blobs. But scrapper got in just like last rework ... (and will probably be out after this one tho)  
---
The main issue isn't to me the out of blob of mesmer but more of the strenght (or synergy) of what is left in the blob that keeps to be untouched.
---
ROFL!
---
&gt; I can definitely see why old players are complaining. Since they "achieved" everything in game any new content for them is either weak or simply too short. But besides that GW2 is just amazing game for anyone who started play the game not so long ago.
---
No one denies that I think.
---
This is as it has been since the first day Lord British drew pixelated breath and is how is shall be when the internet finally collapses under the weight of mobile clickers.
---
Condi scourge minion master -metabattle 
---
Or 
---
Power reaper minion master - metabattle
---
Honestly I have more fun with reaper but Condi scourge has more DPS and sustain (somehow) 
---
I think it's because reaper traits can grant toughness which pulls agro from your minions and ends up getting enemies attention faster.
---
I was running around on my reaper trying to get the last 2 HPs I needed for map comp in TD and the froggo HP kept wrecking me.
---
Switch to Condi and almost killed it a few times before giving up.
---
My reaper was able to drop him to at most 70% hp before dying. 
---
Condi scourge - 5% before dying.
---
Major difference was I had to keep kiting the froggo and resummoning minions on scourge while in reaper I was just auto targeted constantly by all the adds and boss without enough aoe damage to kill everything I was downed to Oblivion.
---
Since then I've just been trying to get into HP trains on that one with no luck sadly.
---
Dyes + garbage
---
Man I love that meme soooooo much xD let's see and try before being pessimistic !
---
Cheers!
---
It really depends on the class as well as boss. Plenty of builds can achieve high numbers and some bosses have more than 1 hitbox so you can damage them multiple times at once.
---
&gt; ye so they nerfed chrono,which is MEDIOCRE in pve
---
Yea, [I mean it's only meta in 14 out of 16 raids](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/)
---
&gt; DEAD in ~~wvw.~~ zerging
---
You can't be meta everywhere, Time to join the other classes.
---
Raptorpuppy easily has the most personality of all the mounts.
---
Basically you want Reaper. Minions and greatsword.
---
Anet doesn't give a fuck about our opinions. They'll do what they want regardless of what they say.
---
Ever notice they NEVER post in this subreddit unless it's some sort of cs issue or to thank someone for some silly art post? 
---
Unlike other games, the devs at Anet aren't interested in talking with their players. Even their interaction on their own forums is minimal.
---
Salvage all, Consume all, Autoloot? man the time without was so annoying
---
Nah, all I want is playable Tengus ! \o
---
From what I've heard, ArenaNet forum moderators are not an in-house position. They just take the basic rules outlined by the devs and community team (or, "no toxicity") and overreact/power Trip with their ability to shutdown discussion.
---
Frankly, seeing how some of the devs interact here on Reddit and in forum posts, I think they would be more than okay and incredibly receptive to such feedback. It's just a shame the moderators prevent such messages from even reaching them.
---
I have fun with reaper, but I do more long term DPS with scourge and apparently have better sustain...
---
Even though scourge to my knowledge has just been nerfed to the ground.
---
Ma question principale est : est-ce que mon équipement élevé sera encore utilisable après ce patch ?  Ou est-ce qu'on devra tout refaire ? Merci
---
Builds with very high burst right now are weaver (sword), dh (gs and sc/t I think) and slb (gs and sw/a). Dh and slb burst happens in very short time period as well, so if those enemies died in 5 seconds it's possible to hit 50k dps with those, weaver would take a few seconds more.
---
Do note that all of these have 30-35k dps in general, they just have very strong burst which is why they are popular in fractals compared to other classes with comparable dps, but lower burst.
---
Check snowcrows or discretize websites to see exact builds.
---
yes, things would need to be diferent and scale diferently.
---
What makes a single player game any different than a MMO other than being able to play with other players? It's not like this is a MOBA or a PvP game where matches are always reset and every single match is different.
---
MMOs have limited content that is meant to be played like you'd do in a single-player game: keep doing stuff and progressing. What you can do differently is that you can create a new character and play new professions.
---
Game developers can't release content as fast as players can do them. If you release an achievement that takes months to be finished, players won't do it and they'll complain it takes too long.
---
Meh, you would play alone for the most part. Story is mediocre at best, with core game plagued by bad voice acting (not player character tho) with rushed end. HoT is just hOt mess. And only Path of Fire really great as story can get in Guild Wars. Liwing World is a crime of narration and voice acting, even free to play games like Warframe have better story released every year on a schedule.
---
What else to do? 
---
Well the only coop gamemode somewhat afloat is fractals that at best have 2 releases a year. And you would have rather hard time getting in them because you need top tier infused gear. You would play low-level fractals... alone with occasional noob group on the prime time (witch is impossible both ways).
---
Dungeons are dead and rotten to the point of complete decomposition. Sometimes there is a group in LFG playing 1 of 8 dungeons.
---
Raids are dead with 1 release a year. There is some guild statics around. Public groups are for the most part are out of reach because of HARD kill proof check run by veteran community. (if you not done raids for the past years, you are not welcome)
---
PvP is dead with several hundred people playing every day (from 11 million pull of accounts). No updates, no balance, you play with the same people and bots every second game.
---
WvW still missing major update that was promised 2 years ago (and it is not even close, optimistic ETA is 2021). Top tier servers even struggle to have more than 1 commander on Friday resets. Only people left are social communities of long time friends.
---
I would say that GW2 is not worth time and money investment in current state. Unless something major changes (at least expansion announced). It would be better to try other games on the market for your mental health. Path of Exile, Warframe, Grim Dawn, FFXIV to name few.
---
Why not both?
---
Very inefficient but viable
---
2022: Removed every skill from the game aside weapon 1 and healing signet.
---
It's just a means to convert direct damage into condition.
---
Strikes me as a reshade problem then, not a compatibility issue between apps.
---
Will need to dig into it some more, check the dll chain between reshade and radial.
---
There are many strange and insular guilds and cliques in Guild Wars 2 that will try and get rid of you with effectively any excuse. I was asked to leave a guild as a clique of a few people had decided I was toxic because of criticism of Snow Crows as a (universally) useful resource and because I tried to discuss what went wrong with repeated wipes. And this happened with the inner clique, members of whom frequently called pugs "fucking cunts" for pointing out errors that had been made repeatedly, deciding they wouldn't discuss issues with me (despite my numerous attempts to do so) and the leadership of the guild apologising to me for the way I was treated since I also brought in more members to their guild to support raiding actually happening. 
---
Thankfully, I've got my own small community Discord where my incredibly toxic attitude supports training raids, static groups and giveaway competitions.
---
That said, the attitude of some Guild Wars 2 raiding groups is so different from anything I've experienced in any other MMO. In other games you all have an intrinsic reward to work towards (better gear), replacements are harder to find and progression takes longer so the atmosphere actively encourages finding common ground, discussing problems and working together. That doesn't happen in Guild Wars 2 as much. It's a shame.
---
please stop flexing not everyone is good at the game
---
Increased wallet, keys in the wallet, more things in the material storage...
---
Honest question: what do you consider an insane requirement? My current expectations towards a training group are pretty much in line with everything I’ve seen from crossroads.
---
If all rewards were removed, what would you play? To me, that’s the only stuff worth doing. I already grind for rewards in my job. I want my gaming to be fun in and of itself. I feel like Guild Wars 2 offers that, but most players aren’t biting, choosing the grindfest anyways.
---
You're welcome.
---
I've installed d912pxy, its great, but it gives me this very weird cutscene glitch. I've tried the visual bug fix it has on it's FAQ page, but it didnt help.
---
It looks like [this](https://imgur.com/kNY48HT).
---
Anyone experienced something similar and have a fix?
---
I want a story where one of the elder dragons awakens and they have a champion like you. And you have to defeat that champion.
---
It’s weird that you point this out, because what attracted me to GW2 was how different it is from other MMOs. I think the MMO genre in general is terrible, and these games are dying for a reason. GW2 at least is fun as a single player game with occasional multiplayer interaction. It’s part of the appeal. 
---
That said, I recognize there are a lot of things Anet could do better. This game has so much untapped potential.
---
I was thinking about having your clones follow you as a possible solution to this nerf as well. It would mean you could actually use your shatters strategically since your clones wouldnt run off and die instantly. I'm not sure how that would flesh out exactly though.
---
But would it mean any improvement? I think Anet never learned from VIM Spike in GW1, Scourge and DH in GW2. Trap gameplay is generally bad for any PvP gamemode. Dropping damage on the ground in skill based game is equal to deletion of everything intended in game design.
---
Bitch if I wanna yell at  clouds I will fucking yell at clouds, suck my dick :c
---
because the post is toxic AF. read the first line in the title.
---
fRee ciTiZEnS oF aMnOOn, YoUR cOuNCil NeeDS yOu!!!1!!
---
That damn npc needs to shut up. He’s the “if Mordremoth could attack the Mother Tree...” of Amnoon 
---
Congratz on the raptor, though. It has some really cute idle animations
---
Many of us have killed Korga. I've even killed him solo. Fun? Challenge? Whatever you want to call it.
---
Obviously, he gets skipped 99% of the time, but only because he's an intentionally optional boss, and honestly isn't even that fun/challenging to face in a decent or better group.
---
That fire signet is so good.
---
Oh I agree that the chance we will see new dungeons with proper rewards and gameplay is pretty low, and we would sooner see easy mode raids than new dungeons. Still, I think its atleast entertaining to discuss dungeons and if it gives devs any ideas thats also good.
---
It is not unlocked yet. It is a sniper rifle with camouflage

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deadliest_Game
---
Did you even read my comment? It's the exact opposite.
---
Getting 425 Kralk ore takes ~30 minutes with a multifarm squad. Getting 3x 25 Kralk ore aka doing 3 hearts takes "0 minutes" here, because you can do it while waiting for meteorites. Means you get a weapon within 30 minutes.
---
Getting 4x5 Branded mass aka doing 4 hearts takes about 20 minutes. Farming all 30 nodes to get 20-30 Branded mass takes 10-15 minutes. You end up with 25-30 minutes farming and only 40-50 Branded mass. 
---
Means you have to wait a whole day, to do the same things, do meta events, do map completion oder change chars and do hearts again.
---
Waiting a day and do the same things again takes 1 day + ~10 minutes (two hearts).
---
Meta events both take 15 minutes. 
---
Changing chars and doing 2 hearts are 10 minutes. 
---
Map completion takes about 30 minutes or longer. 
---
No matter what you do, you end up needing way more time than farming Kralk ore. Either 10-30 minutes or 1 day+.
---
As a raid seller myself where we 8 man, its hardly harder. The only boss I dislike selling is xera. The rest are pretty trivial as 8. Of course there is largos which is harder 9 or 8 if your dps is ass, but if your dps players are decent then its still a joke
---
this guy is bonkers, don't listen to him. His *objective* points like server population are an easy to disprove lie and his *subjective* arguments are something you have to form on yourself. Maybe you don't like the story and end up agreeing with him, but that's up to you to decide.
---
Wow this is asinine.
---
Can you link me the build?All I've find is banner support,are you referring to that one?
---
Maybe I'm not alone in this, but I've never in my life been able to get a good damage rotation off, both with full ascended gear and following build guides from Snowcros/Metabattle and with food and I find myself giving up at golem before even looking at raid training.
---
My old guild ran training and were super friendly so I did Cairn, Musraat Overseer and Samarog with them a couple times but the guild dissolved entirely after my last guild wars hiatus :(
---
I just feel really frustrated that I'm doing things completely wrong but can't work it out. I have boons stacked as recommended and I feel like I'm hitting the rotations fairly quickly, but my damage is always just "meh". This is on my ele weaver, reaper and daredevil. The only time I've felt relevant was when I was running my dagger Deadeye but that doesn't work in every raid.
---
Any ideas where I might be going wrong that I've overlooked? I know I'm doing something wrong, I just can't put my finger on it.
---
This, so much this.
---
Plot twist: none of them will stack.
---
Reddit and the official forum is where the whiniest community exists.
---
Killcry, did you try the DirectX proxy?
---
Is this bait or stupidity
---
Awesome \^.\^
---
&gt; I actually like the meaninglessness.
---
In the context of a story, yes, it's great, but I'm talking about meaninglessness in general. I'd love for my actions to mean far less than they do now, like no one cares, or you just helped some nobodies, but I don't want them to be meaningless, as in your typical "kill 10 boars" stuff that has no impact because they just respawn and you're only wasting your time.
---
However, turn that into a group of boars eating the fields of some poor community, and now we have a meaning, a reason to actually do that quest. You can make that even better by adding alternative approaches: Maybe you can solve the problem by finding why the boars are eating there to begin with, maybe you can make the vegetables taste bad so they go away, maybe you can scare them, maybe you can capture them and build a farm, etc. This isn't 100% sandbox, since there's a story and a fixed plot driving you here, but it's a good middle point.
---
Then you add resets and repeatability, and now you can replay the experience multiple times, trying different outcomes for different rewards and storylines, instead of them being permanent changes in the world you can't undo.
---
Failure could have a bigger impact under a system like this too. You won't feel punished too much, because you can just repeat everything later, but you will feel very punished for the moment, and you will have to face the consequences of your mistakes. It's something dynamic events fail at, they never make failure have a strong enough failure. That's why I wish they brought classic questing back, mixing the best from story instances and map meta events.
---
&gt;For instance, if something only affects 1% of the playerbase, it might not be as common as the forums lead you to believe.
---
But the fight is guaranteed, that's my point. In a free PvP environment, someone looking for a fight might not find it, while a closed environment like arena ladders provides fights almost instantly. It's just like having places to hang around with people who have the same interests, and yeah, players can designate those meeting places themselves, but it's always easier to just design them the right way.
---
&gt;My own headcanon for GW2 follows a similar set of underpowered characters that get by on charm, wit, or dumb luck. I'm so done with DBZ super saiyan stuff. Give me a normal person who's a little bit clever. What they can accomplish is actually impressive.
---
Marvel movies are the cancer of this day and age.
---
If you interact with the community enough, you should be able to find most of those too. My guild has people from pretty much all levels of dedication and styles of gameplay, so I see the bigger picture easily, specially with noob issues no one pays attention to.
---
In the end it's all about learning to listen right. Most of the time people won't tell you the problem, because they can't recognize it themselves, but you can research into their issues and find the real deal behind them. Good game design relies in human factors more than numbers, and I'd go as far as to say numbers are useless without that human factor in place.
---
Very nice! I like the slice-o-life aspect to it - not everything is a big life-changing adventure.  I'd love to see another Charr-centric comic!
---
are you attacking from stealth or range? well, not each class does that, and even if you're a bursty longbow soulbeast you can benefit from free quickness; i mean which other food gives your damage an up to 50% damage increase or at least forces your opponent to use some Cooldowns really quickly?
---
Guild missions are one of the game's most boring things ever, they really need to revamp them.
---
Except I don't need to play Mesmer to understand the role a chrono has and the responsibilities it has in a party. Which I do.
---
And I don't need to play Mesmer to evaluate a particular comp over another from a dps point of view. Which I also do.
---
And balancing in this game is primarily driven by popularity, hence the relentness nerfing of already underperforming builds (staff eles would like to say "hello", but they're already dead and they will be even deader as of tomorrow).
---
So no, my arguments are on point and you're still simply disregarding them, you're merely trying to hide this fact behind a wall of text. Kind of makes me wonder why are you spending all this effort explaining why you're not using actual arguments instead of... you know, actually using arguments?
---
[This, titles were leaked long ago.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero_(achievements))
---
It might be worth saying, "I'm not experienced, but if you have room I'd love to join", and if they say no then no big deal, but given it's wings 1 and 4 they probably don't mind bringing a new raider along. I'm fairly sure wing 4 was designed to be a lead in for new raiders anyway; just don't stack with agony, don't stand on spikes and do DPS.
---
Maybe the place for that is the forums where there is a larger chance of them listening, though?
---
People act like bitching and complaining on Reddit is going to get an anet devs attention when that's simply less likely to happen on here than it is using their official system
---
I'm betting for a cake chair too.
---
Once you've put all of the mirrors in place around Istan the collection gives you one irradiated crystal for free.
---
Hear this man!
---
Have you tried moving around dxgi.dll? To work I had to put it in the main gw2 folder, not the bin64 one.
---
I agree. Would be neat to see guild beetle race along with a rework.
---
3d9d.dll is that a typo?
---
Imagine this stat was also added to bosses to revert power creep.
---
I somehow feel like this didn't even do anything to sanctum scramble specifically because I still had to watch a guide second by second to even get gold for that one and it was CLOSE. You screw up once on your rehearsal of the guide and lose your chance at those AP. Fungus Among Us felt the same way.
---
Did they get changed very much or not very much?
---
get a mount...:o
---
it is yes
---
My guild used to do training raids. One of our members was great at learning dps rotations, but good lord was he trash at mechanics. I remember he tried putting together a druid to be helpful and when he finally realized druids don't have a set rotation (it's just rotating around mistakes and mechanics), just suggestions, he was mystified. We found out in the coming weeks that when we thought he'd been paying attention, he had not internalized any non-insta kill, dps mechanic.
---
How did he not know greens in vg did damage? I understood when he needed to be taught how to properly kite certain bosses, but surely realizing that you can't blow your pets cc abilities for damage is a no brainer.
---
I think it's more fun to get an actual group of other new players to tough it through stuff without being carried.   
---
I just started playing and when I get to 80 I'm gonna look for other new players and find other new players to make a guild.
---
It's not exactly a linear scale like that, and besides 100% for us is 300% for arenanet, they've said themselves they don't have anyone in the company who can benchmark - they suck at the game!
---
Could you remind me what it was we defeated in gw1 to prevent the elder from awaking?
---
Imagine reading the post you're commenting on in 2019 LUL
---
that worked, thank you o.o
---
A unique mount skin would be awesome.
---
In fact, Im glad I havent, I always pulled my own weight and make sure im not a deadweight crying like you are doing right now
---
you do realize that you have a shitton to do if you introduce a new stat that directly affects the forumla on how damage is calculated and how it interacts with everything in the whole game?
---
Couple tips:
---
\-Try getting it down as muscle memory to use a charge of the elite mantra when you're using the signet so it has a better chance of landing
---
\-Give mace a shot, sword and axe are more for hybrid builds. mace 3 is a life saver that gives you a lot of breathing room when focused and saves charges of your heal
---
\-Always try to open with 5 in your f2 tome, it's a free +33% healing to boost up your 1/2/4 and can convert poison to regen for additional healing
---
\-Always open with 4 in your f3 tome, it negates vuln and poison so you can heal up faster while reducing burst directed at you. After that use 2 if anyone's close enough to hit, 3 if your team is getting pewpew'd, or 5 if neither of the other two conditions are met. f3 #2 is pretty fast casting and heals due to pure of heart, it's great for breaking up a concentrated attack on you
---
Yeah. I would have liked to see the raiding community thriving, but not only did I disband my training group, I also quit raiding wholesale at the same time.
---
I didn't mention that as it wasn't relevant to my point, but yes, I got so burnt out that I didn't even care about generating new raiders to fill LFG because I was done with the whole game mode by that point.
---
I don't blame Anet for the burnout. It's just a thing that happens. I would have gotten sick of training eventually anyway, but maybe it wouldn't have happened as quickly if I wasn't always thinking how much gold I could have made farming SW for 4 hours, or whatever.
---
People reaching 7th birthday usually already have quite a lot of mount skins bought, mainly from gold-&gt;gem exchange. One exclusive skin choosable from set of 4 base mounts + Warclaw would be great reward. But that would kill the meme of "mount skins being only gemstore" so reddit will not be pleased regardless if it will be the case or not.
---
What's good? You will never hit a benchmark dps in a raid, save perhaps on MO. In the practice arena, with buffs, you want to aim to get within 5-8k of the benchmark at least. For elementalist, read guides on after-cast canceling if it's really bothering you. Also keep in mind that those that set benchmarks will have infusions on every piece of gear they have, raising their damage by like 10% extra or some shit.
---
In an actual raid, depending on the boss, you want to have 15-20k dps, generally. I recommend using a dps meter like arcdps for tracking and self improvement. You can get little graphs instantly that show you when you peaked damage and such.
---
Thief and ranger have the easiest rotations.
---
Nah, too hard. ANET too busy with gemstore and living world.
---
Why not buy some loot boxes instead?
---
Ye sure, random dude on reddit knows better than top raiding guild.
---
I put my merchants etc from black lion chests there because if they’re just in my bank I’ll never use them and I’m too cheap for the permanent ones. 
---
As it seems you’re mainly doing non-instanced content, other suggestions would be: Silverwastes shovels, teleportation guns, ogre whistles/fire elemental powder/... (although those may be soulbound), Bags of Gear (because you’ll want to open them on a low level character), quartz crystals (for charging them daily)
---
For WvW, there’s the candy corn gobbler and the food merchant. 
---
For fractals/raids: the omnipotion (or the three unlimited ones) and a xera portal
---
I did not understand about #2. After killing a weak point you can use the ley-line to glide upwards and glide towards the next weak point with no need to get out of combat and mount
---
But the nostalgia goggles. We need a little of that every week. Last week it was the marionette thread.
---
You're right, edited. So many people running out of combat to hop on their skyscales though.
---
Reduction of memory transfers per drawcalls, that is.
---
Good gods, I must have that thing sitting in the inventory of one of my characters.
---
What's all this Selbbub talk?  I thought we still only had the first letter to go off of?
---
The biggest issue with the map is the tedious need to tag every event possible for a decent amount of keys.
---
They should use a participation and meta progression system like the HoT maps.
---
staff isn't a very good condi weapon either ... and reaper even makes the staff slightly better
---
Depends on what exactly you want to do. 
---
Personally, I get a build off of snowcrows/lucky noobs (german only)/discretize/metabattle and run with that, since I raid and just use the same builds for open world since they’re good enough. 
---
Those builds can be adjusted to be cheaper and more fitted to open world though. Gear wise, I’d go with more precision and some other runes, e.g. Strength, as Scholar makes no sense in most situations. For solo content, I also replace the group buffing traits and skills with self-buffing/defensive ones. If I notice I need more condi removal, I’ll take “Shake it off” over some other skill like a banner or run with the condi remove on weapon swap trait,...

Seriously. Get gold for playing the parts of the game you enjoy. Do you like Fractals? Play daily fractals. Like PvP? Do league. Like world bosses? Make sure you at least do daily Teq.
---
Thanks
---
Alt-tabbing away easily fill your RAM up or even just crash out. If you want to troubleshoot this - follow github readme.
---
So then the best shot we have would be for ANet to put in place something like the debuff idea I laid out so that blobs won't actually exist at all. PvE types who don't want real competition who try to join groups for the protection will find that they can't get much XP or loot die to the stacking debuff. They no longer get all the benefits of the blob carrying them, and will quit playing wvw. Maybe?
---
Because “work” increases variability. Buffing toughness would be the easy solution, but requiring both toughness+ new stat to reduce power damage by the highest possible would be fun and allow more variation in play styles. Hyper aggressive? Super defensive? Sure you can stack toughness, vitality, and then the new stat, but you wouldn’t have any damage. No condi damage and no power damage, just defense. It makes it so you have to sacrifice another stat (either vitality or damage) to achieve this damage reduction.
---
Followed by a reduction in the availability of boons, or reduced effectiveness of concentration, the game would be in a good spot of either choosing defense against conditions or defense against power.
---
That might actually be easier to pull off these days
---
Anet needs to give Asura more bad ass look options like these! Now all options are verry fluffy. Love this asura’s style/ look!
---
My bad, wrong write the url.  
---
This is corrected.  
---
  
---
And there's no problem, besides your file has done me a great service and it proves that you have to have a lot more people doing the same thing than just one \^\^
---
Indeed the API no longer gives precise information on McM's obsessive cards and I had trouble finding the names and you had them.
---
Well, these cards no longer exist, but it's better to have the real names anyway.
---
If you keep wiping versus someone, in my experience, they will be the sort of player that continues to go after you while ignoring all other WvW objectives. Don't allow yourself to become their beat up doll, and do your best to waste their time. Lead them to dead ends in the map and portal back to the complete opposite end. It's their own fault for deciding to waste their time on someone they can beat on. Learn to read the map and see where other roamers might be moving. If you keep getting intercepted while on route, consider carrying travel gear with toughness and vitality to use during those transits. Change your build to focus on mobility. Take routes that give you more visibility as opposed to the straightforward routes.
---
Or just get good at PvP, but the good news is that WvW doesn't just have to be PvP.
---
You did not try hard enough.
---
That’s overly simplified. It doesn’t include weakness, critical strike damage, or other damage modifiers. I assume it would go in the formula where everything else would go for critical strikes and additional damage modifiers...
---
If they are running away when you pop it, they will get out of combat range allowing you to mount up before it finishes ticking down enough to dismount t to catch them hem.
---
I'll have to check that game out. Thanks for this!
---
Well, there is no realistic solution to players who do not like PvP but who want to benefit from it by piggybacking. Carebears gonna carebear. I'm in the middle. I will not spvp, but I'm okay in wvw. I don't solo roam though, and I like defensive action best. The problem with the idea of just excluding those who don't want to fully pvp is that the population of wvw will mimic that of spvp. Namely, only a tiny percentage will remain. Certianly not enough to make the game more engaging. So you have to accept that leeches will exist, but figure out how to encourage them to be more engaged. Maybe change the participation formula so that if you are just mildlessly following a blob you don't get any participation boost and soon will be getting almost zero pips or wxp. Whatever. But ANet has to be onboard, and this is the big problem.
---
The Griffin only takes about 3 hours to get. 250g is the only rough part (for new players)
---
For the old Desert Map names I kinda went with how I thought the translation would be like based on how Anet translation works (rather weirdly for having played with a bunch of translated in-game strings) and the vague memory of some friends.
---
So not all of them are correct:  for Depot I know that "Bougie" is the correct one but for the other one I went with a random stuff based on the fact that the Enligh version read "Volatn d'Inertie".
---

There's no shortcuts, but sometimes there's organized runs for the things that are hard to do solo.  
---
Gotta keep and eye on the LFGs.
---
I do have enough gold :). ive been playing this game for some time after all. So it is only the gold purchases and wont take long game run like beetle right? for beetle i spend 2 days for the missions, and some of them were world bosses which appear only on fixed times.
---

---
thx for the link, will check it out
---
I find it funny that people always seem to bring up about how folks will skip, when unskippable bosses and trash mobs have become a thing consistently for raids and fractals and even post-release dungeons (Molten Facility, Aetherblade Retreat, and Aetherpath).
---
I mean, it's true, if people can skip they will, but ArenaNet has consistently prevented skipping in all dungeon-like content since release where they realized that people would do such if given the opportunity.
---
You can use shrines in combat as well, so you dont even need ley lines.
---
Hahahahah 
---
-cries-
---
&gt; they are hard to kill. 
---
Are you even focusing on menders? There's nothing hard about weak points, regardless of number of players on them, 5-10 is usually enough.
---
im talking about fractals,who whoud play one raid for a year? *top* raiding groups left months ago XD wtf
---
Oh lord. I’d like to play the game without resorting to OP builds, lol. (Though I do play Power Minion Master in open world, so...straddling the line lol.)
---
There are a couple of things that are time limited, like a bounty and events. Make sure while you are working on the other things, you keep an eye on lfg and occasionally check if the events are going. Like the one in Highlands is pretty decent length so you have a good margin for error, but it's a pain to just afk and wait for it to respawn. Facet usually gets off postings but can also be a pain if it's the only thing you have left. Check the wiki it other sources for the full list of what you need, and keep an eye on the events/bounties etc.
---
Ah okay I was wondering how it worked if it was like a constant streamline of clones or if it was just every now and then, Thanks for that.
---
It's awesome. Thanks for all. It works great. But Windows freezes at 2 seconds intervals while map loading if you're in alt+tab.

"Ugh, look at these people wanting to try raiding without already knowing how"

Rifle Deadeyes have better selfheal as seen in Wing7 CM Qadim.
---
As for dps I'm not sure wich fight that is but Weaver in Fractals should get about 120-140k burst singletarget, Soulbeasts sit at 110-120k and even Dragonhunter get up to 100k bursts...
---
Mate that was exactly thy reason I asked for Unique or Superior stuff.
---
What is Charr? Candy?
---
Did you make guardian or rev?If you don't i propose norn guardian and charr rev
---
\*Zojja wakes up... and goes back to sleep\*

It's easy if you know how.

Griffon is mostly fun to get. And way less pain than farming for skyscale.
---
I'm a simple man. I see necromancer - I upvote.
---
Aaah, tuna, the bumblebee of the sea
---
Foundry was fairly popular for the unique jetpack and the fact that we knew it'd be time limited.
---
Personally, I do miss dungeons and wonder what they could've been too, but I think they made the right move focusing on fractals if they had to have one or the other.
---
In Mirage your goal is to have 3 clones almost constantly. Even when you shatter you use skills that generate clones again soon after.

I wish I could afford this clawn cosplay. The one thing I am missing in my life is attention seeking. There is nothing better then force youself on others so you would feel less lonely in this singe player game.
---
1. Best way to level up is to do events, but generally just play the game. Most things give you XP. Killing mobs is probably the slowest way unless you find mobs that haven't been killed in a while and give bonus XP. These mobs are usually those with yellow names as they're not hostile until attacked, but it can also be on maps with low population.
---
2. Respecing isn't a thing. You get all the points you need to get everything. If you have a specific build you're following/think you'll like, test it in the PvP lobby against the golems and then take note of what skills and traits you need to complete the build and put points in them just so you have your build as quickly as possible.
---
3. For PvP, check out Metabattle. For WvW you will need to be level 80 and in good (Exotic) gear before you can really do anything without being shredded. For PvE, check out Metabattle. The builds you find online are usually ideal starting points. Once you have those builds, look at your skills and traits and see if there's anything you want to change to make things easier on you, but also respect the build. It's fine to take out a % bonus or two, but they add up fast.
---
Unfortunately I think you'll just need to base your character around it. A male human with pale skin and the most muscular build would do the trick, maybe use a novelty to make yourself float out of battle
---
Casting couch
---
It's not that they expect to be carried, it's just that it seems like in order to raid you have to experienced, and in order to be experienced you have to raid. There's zero opportunity to just jump in and play and learn as you go.
---
"Join a training raid"
---
Ok, but some people don't really like to listen to lectures about mechanics for 20 minutes before playing the game. Plus there are plenty of players who are great players but have no experience raiding, so joining a training doesn't really help unless they're going to get clears. You can do all the training runs in the world but if none of them result in kills, you're still inexperienced as far as raid groups are concerned because you have no kp.
---
Torbjorn almost had something to say about this

Chairs have not been dyable thus far, and they won't start now, sadly. You'll have to match the glider to the chair color if you want them to look alike.
---
Oh fun, thanks.
---
&gt; im talking about fractals
---
No, You're talking about PVE that's literally what you said - Raids fall under that.
---
&gt;who whoud play one raid for a year?
---
What are you on about? One raid? It's meta on 14 out of 16 fights.

---
You could just click the link instead of continuing to argue
---
If you already hated getting the roller beetle, griffon and skyscale are going to be really unfun as well. But griffon less so, I suppose. 
---
But yes, both these mounts have a gold cost, especially the griffon. It's just in addition to some other collection stuff like the beetle has.
---
i guess i worded that poorly - but i left because most of my friends left - and i kinda just got board
---
1. Im aware, I like the higj risk high reward gameplay
---
 Most of the time (especially in fractals) ill be the last one standing in most fights
---
2. I have a lot of movement abilities and dodges that allow me to bounce alll over the place
---
3. Yup, they're annoying, specially that ooze in the fractal, but its usually frustrating because my team cant keep up with my dps (im not bragging, its just a lot of them run non dps classes) so its a common problem.
---
Condition are unaffected by Toughness. So it makes no difference.
---
You must not have graduated basic algebra.
---
With a beard... so much teasing of things that never happen :&lt;
---
You can also save alot of time too.   
---
Lets say you work at a US minimum wage job for $10 per hour (Different place may vary), and you spend 1 hour working and got $10. And you spend $10 on 800 gem. For 800 gem you can get 250 to 260 gold transfer (Current currency exchange rate when this was posted).  
---
Soooo your time spent working, rather than grinding is much profitable (Both in saving time and earning profit. Both irl cash and gw2 gold). Unless you can earn 250 gold within one hour.
---
Next meta : Deadeye with Power + Ferocity + Precision + Lethality amulet.
---
A condition that halves Critical Damage for its duration ?  
---
The base 150% would become 125%, while 220% become 160%.
---
Dont ruin my fantasy.
---
its not looking to get some quick kills, its looking to learn fast and from good players. whatever, you go on wiping hundred times if you need that to learn a mechanic lol

Actually chairs  being undyable is a bit less justifiable than back items. Chairs are mounts that can't move. We can dye mounts therefore we *should* be able to dye chairs too.

---
See? You think about the Chronos role. You don't think about the possibility that Anet could want an other role for Chrono or just want it to be different. 
---
&gt; And balancing in this game is primarily driven by popularity
---
Again just your opinion and not even right this time. 
---
They explained the reason of their changes and it wasn't popularity.
---
&gt; With the upcoming update we're continuing to create the promised tradeoffs to some elite specialization...
---
&gt; all in order to make the choice of an elite specialization more meaningful....
---
&gt; The other main focus of this update is adjustments to core trait lines on several professions to address some pain points and power imbalances.
---
To bring more differences between core and elite specs is clearly the main part of this patch as well as improving core trait lines. No "popularity patch".
---
&gt; So no, my arguments are on point
---
I'm sorry, they are not. :)
---
&gt; and you're still simply disregarding them, you're merely trying to hide this fact behind a wall of text.

I tried to hold it short, but no you demanded the long version. So stop complaining about it, you wanted it.....

That's an iron dagger. 
---
One can tell because of the difference in colors between the blade and the handle.
---
Darksteel daggers have lighter handles, steel and bronze daggers would have a yellow tinge and steel daggers would have a darked handle. 
---
Mithril daggers would have a brighter blade. 
---
I don't know why would anyone want to photoshop a dagger in the hands or a herald, tho. Most people would prefer a greatsword.

Yeah that much I understand though I don't see why anyone has a problem with the idea of people getting some of the mounts first before beginning HoT? No one has really given me a reason as to why it would "ruin the experience."
---
I had that same thought, but I guess it has something to do with chairs being novelties and wanting to save effort.

It's ok, now everyone will just think your the weirdo, roll with it haha.

Here's how it went...... Ritualists afked too hard with theit spirits that they wemt extinct, then the paragons drowned in their wealth that they're made of gold and ecto, and finally monks were banned cause wtf are good monks?  That's the story of the classes :)

---
I like WvW... \*cries\*
---
* There are paragon NPCs, but not paragon profession or elite specialization.
---
* Guardian is the spiritual successor of monks, and has also inherited traits from paragons and somehow also from ritualists. 
---
 * They have many skills named after monk skills with similar themes.
---
 * They have also shouts named after paragon shouts.
---
 * They have spirit weapons, though they work nothing like GW1's spirit weapons.
---
* Revenants also inherited the 'see the mists' and 'connection to spirits' thematic of ritualists. They also have blindfold headgear. 
---
Although they work nothing like the professions that inspired them, they have similar thematics, so it's more of a lore connection than a gameplay equivalence.
---
How much of what you have was done with PUGs?

Ok cool, thank you, this was the best answers.

For sure I don't really follow human politics in gw2, but wasn't Kralkatorrik the main reason treaty was signed at all? I imagine some charr thinking that with Kralkatorrik gone, they can go back to war, not caring about other dragons, because they are not direct threat to their homeland. And from what I know, Flame Legion and Ascalonian ghosts are also scattered.
---
Hmmm well Im a wvw vet(rank 1569) and I’ve been across many servers.

It was explained the last time with the skyscale chair. The mechanism used to let us look like sitting on chair is the same mechanism used for tonics.

This is really reliant on what boss you're talking about.  VG?  Sure. Gorse?  Maybe.  Sab?  Okay.  Cairn, MO, Sam?  Yeah.  Keep in mind you're either missing out on 15k DPS which could set you below a threshold to skip mechanics via phasing faster, missing someone for a mechanic like kiting pylons at Qadim 2.0, or missing the extra CC to stop a death at Sam in wing 4.

How to make a toxic community: this post.
---
I think a few revenant weapons were scrapped before release, main-hand dagger being one of them.
---
I think it was a great excuse to do a few jumping puzzles together with your friends, and also a good excuse to check WvW once in a while.
---
The plot thickens.
---
So the other things that were being cleaved does not need to die at all for that fight?
---
They weren’t more important than the boss was.
---
Raids work in mysterious ways.
---
Haha, nice! I read it in English class a few years ago, though in that medieval-like English containing words like "thou" and "thee". I'm glad, it's paying off. :D
---
Feel free to explain how. GW2 is *entirely* CPU-reliant, and adding a DX12 wrapper wont allow it to use more threads. All it does is increase the CPU overhead further.
---
I guess if you test it on an absolutely shit GPU from 5 gens ago you could see small gains.
---
its dhuum.. its really not hard to get that number as power dps.. tbh its quite low for that
---
It was either them, or another training group that said i was trash for trying to run a support Tempest, despite the team needing the raw healing to clear. since a druid wasnt sufficient. Training groups tend to take a fair bit of damage, and the Druid meta wasnt making up for it. But hey they blocked me so i aint gotta talk to em anymore.   
---
It was a bit ago. so i cant remember if it was them or another training discord. I think there was at least Two of em
---
OP is literally complaining about someone else trying to start a run and not being experienced
---
I agree GW2 is a beautiful game in it’s own way but damn I recently started with The Witcher 3 and wow you can have your cake and eat it.
---
I just started on a support chronomancer.. I need to craft 5 more ascended armour pieces.. is it still worth it? or should I wait for what is going to come? Switch to power chrono?
---
I'm here to talk about the real issue with this photo: a male sylvari with FACIAL HAIR (or leaves?).
---
Can we have this please!? My cabbages are too bare faced!
---
Yes the reliance on Wells for Quickness/Alacrity would need to end, that's never really been fun gameplay. 
---
I would rather see Chrono spread those two boons via Shatters instead. Chrono should keep the personal Shatter, and spec'ing Chrono should cause all four shatters to apply Quickness or Alacrity. Include a Grand Master trait that toggles shatters between the two boons, so they can apply one or the other but not both.
---
That would focus its gameplay more on its class mechanic, which is pretty fun. Then increase its dps to be similar to Quickbrand and Alacrigade so it can effectively replace one or the other, depending on whether spec'd for Quickness or Alacrity shatters, but not both.
---
You're welcome. Charr, human and asura politics are always fun to talk about. :)
---
Yes, Ash Imperator Malice's plotting with Almorra and realizing the Vigil's importance to resist Kralkatorrik was what in part led to the covert truce faction forming among the charr. Even Smodur wasn't part of this group at first but he was later won over as he, an ever cunning politician, realized the potential that ceasefire with humans would offer him so he could cement his position of leadership in Ascalon.
---
As for Bangar, he has had several reasons not to realize his ambitions yet. Even before Kralkatorrik rose and brought the Branded into Ascalon (and thus led to the creation of the Vigil when the grieving Almorra founded the army to battle him and the other dragons, and the eventual creation of the truce faction as charr realized the threat the dragons posed), the three High Legions had to deal with the zealous Flame Legion and their extensive network of infiltrators, the unrelenting Foefire ghosts, and the expansive ogres, so Bangar had his claws full with all sorts of troubles plaguing the charr throughout Ascalon and Blazeridge Mountains. His hatred for humans also overcame his suspicions about the other imperators so he continued working alongside them for the time being.
---
With recent events, the situation in Ascalon and Central Tyria as a whole has become different than when personal story began. The Flame Legion has divided into squabbling splinter factions who haven't yet found another Baelfire type of leader to unite them under one banner. Bangar may or may not have lost trust in sylvari after the Mordremoth debacle. He should be quite aware that the White Mantle insurrection; Pact's campaigns in Orr, Maguuma and Elona; Joko's invasions; and the Centaur War have diminished humanity's strength considerably even though humans are still far from beaten and slowly recovering. Kralkatorrik's death has likewise led to notable if gradual diminishment of the Branded menace even though the unchained Branded champions continue to be a menace for now. The Foefire ghosts were somewhat weakened in a specific part in Ascalon after Rytlock's cleansing ritual attempt, and should the charr figure out if they need to fulfill the human legend's requirements of a true heir of Ascalon from Doric's bloodline wielding Sohothin and/or Magdaer to end the ghost threat, that leaves the diminished Separatists (who no longer have secret wealthy patrons like Caudecus supporting them) and ogres (who have suffered losses to Branded) to deal with.
---
After the Claw of the Khan-Ur became a legendary weapon, devs sneakily added the original Claw on Smodur's table in his war room where we can admire it to this day. This blatant display of the Claw might make Bangar believe that the ever-shrewd Smodur is attempting to cement his authority via possession of the Claw and approving of the Ebonhawke Treaty and eventually claim his right to be the next Khan-Ur; after all, Smodur already possesses the Claw and claims to be a direct descendant of the Khan-Ur (as all imperators do), so now he just needs an epic feat (such as purging the Foefire ghosts permanently) to fulfill the three requirements for most charr to consider him fit to claim the title. Bangar obviously wouldn't tolerate this development, and it would be enough (along with the aforementioned weakening of various enemy factions and humanity over the years) for him to make his move even though he's signed and ratified the Ebonhawke Treaty with the other imperators already between 1325 AE (start of personal story) and 1331 AE (when we discussed the treaty stuff with Xeniph's ghost while taking her on a tour throughout Fields of Ruin to claim a fan-inspired greatsword).
---
What "Requiem: Rytlock" short story showed us is that Bangar thankfully isn't Baelfire 2.0 or even Balthazar 2.0 (at least from what little glimpse we saw in the narrative). While he's said to be distrustful and prone to rage, he has also shown his cunning such as how he used Crecia's womanhood to his advantage in the Flame Legion infiltration mission, or how he deliberately manipulated and humiliated Rytlock while making himself seem like a hero in the narrative. There's also been intriguing fan speculation that Bangar may be secretly funding or supporting the Renegades (being a kind of charr version of Caudecus who secretly did the same for Separatists) who continue fighting against humans and incite wavering charr soldiers to rebel against the treaty as many Renegades come from the Blood Legion based on what we learn in Ascalon maps and personal story. The association of Blood and Renegades could of course just be a coincidence, but I imagine Bangar would be clever enough to cover his tracks if anyone became suspicious and began snooping around.
---
Should Bangar begin hostilities and take on humans and/or the two High Legions in the future, I'm curious to see what ultimately causes him to make his move and how he goes about it. The lore already has curious mentions of [Fume Brighteye](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fume_Brighteye), a so far unseen female Iron Legion tribune who is a vicious soldier bucking to be the next imperator and who opposes the Ebonhawke Treaty due to her sire being martyred by humans in Ebonhawke, so I wonder if Bangar might reach out to her discreetly and propose a plot to have Smodur assassinated so Fume can make her move to become the next Iron imperator whose human-hating ideas would be more in line with Bangar's. I could imagine the politics being depicted similar to the Secret of NIMH film where the rat politician Jenner seized an opportunity to start plotting to cause the "accidental" death of their society's leading figure and further his own ambitions as seen [here](https://youtu.be/RG-fhcO5kkA) and [here](https://youtu.be/pwLF9L6V3Ik) (if only Jenner's great VA Paul Shenar still lived, he'd make a great Bangar; I could see ANet reusing his memorable line "No taste for blood, eh? They've taken the animal out of you."). :)

&gt;has all those legendaries 
---
&gt;is still missing tequatl weapons

Excuse me but why would you stack healing debuff on someone who just survived a burst? Like if he is bad enough or i am good enough to survive it should be my right to be able to resustain. There are classes - looking at you, power shatter mirage/chrono who can deal 15k burst instantly... why should i be punished? Or do i understand it wrong?

Oooooooooo gratz Rumpy

It probably takes me about 20h to do the full 100% map completion, but it can be done in [less than 13h](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9xex1x/world_completion_in_12_hours_37_minutes_on/).

and wurm armor :)
---
Wow. Congrats on all the hard work.
---
That’s quite sick. Thnx for info!
---
Op should try Risk Of Rain 2
---
If I'm on Herald I assume I'll have no trouble maintaining Fury, and you have Roiling Mists traited too, so that's a free 40% crit chance right there. Your gear, because of those 3 pieces of Assassin's armor and the sigil of accuracy, is just under 60% crit chance, so you're almost crit capped by yourself. That's some nice damage for open world, which you say you'll be doing 99% of the time.
---
It will be solved if their backbone get straightened.
---
lol yeeah...I'm not too mad at groups that want experience with the run... But when I make a group that is clearly marked "Learning- don't expect a win" and people join in and we do the boss once and 3 people bail with one guy saying "bad" rustles my jimmies real good.  
---
It also rustles my jimmies when I make a group post that clearly states what we are doing... and then someone joins and is like "What we doing guys" lol
---
Yes I know but searching 'Ghost' in reddit also garners a lot of unrelated content.

Because I wanted to?

Not sure where you got the extra 4% from. Impact sigil will give you all your damage back on average, and you're no longer losing 5% if you take any damage. You can always adjust your assassin/zerker pieces. Also keep in mind enemies over level 80 reduce your crit chance, so overcapping in open world isn't always a waste.
---
You can just go full Berserker's gear with Accuracy sigils and precision food (Truffle Steak), and you'll be fine.
---
Had full zerker with sigil of accuracy
---
Skyscale skin when?
---
This game is very alt friendly and leveling is not that time consuming and later on you will have enough tomes of knowledge to level with that if you want to make a new character. Most things are account bound as well so what you mostly have on one character you have on others.
---
So go with what you enjoy. And level it up and then make another one. Having more then one character is never bad anyway because then you can swap if something is needed or you feel like changing just that day :)

I would wait. 5 armor pieces is a lot to lose if the meta changes.

Priory's Historical Shoes
---
Also on sylvari and norm some armor models have clipping T.T
---
The idea is to make elite specs less of a straight upgrade over the base class.
---
None of what a mesmer really needs to bring in WvW (portal, veil, illusion of life) requires chrono. So, maybe base mesmer is just going to be better than chrono in WvW, at least for zergs. That's ok.
---
Wurm armor is a thing!?

Too much. Its rumpo.

You have your account still. Log in and see if you like it. If you're curious about the new expansion, it's probably $25 on sale (and the mounts alone make it worth it).

It's really easy to find a casual guild to play with, just hang out in one of the major cities or just play the game and occasionally ask if anyone you're playing with is recruiting.

---
While writing this post, open a new squad and look for players.
---
That wall of text caught me by surprise, but information you've provided is A+.
---
It only proves my suspicions regarding blood legion. About Rytlock perspective though, it might be biased as certain historic texts that were written by king demands. 
---
About funding... There's still certain charr that probably has quite a lot of coin from his Trading Company. They have put strange hints in his headquarters with boxes and Asura Portal, but from what I remember, it didn't develop from there. Arenanet stated already that they love to plant stuff in their game with no story direction set in stone, so they can pick it up later. Like "Mother...".
---
I'm also not sure if it's some placebo effect, but some Blood Legion charr in their race homeinstance seem to use different idle animations and armor is shaded differently. I always remember charr having vibrant red coloron they armor, but some of them got more brownish shading. And idle animations seem to be more stiff, they tail isn't moving at all. My theory about stiff idle animation is that by some mistake, they use Tengu ones. Those birds wave their tail just in two directions, like this weird kind of blood legion charrs. Let's not mention they also run in ridiculous way! But as I said - I could simply not notice it before.
---
Oh, and I've forgotten to mention. After last LS patch Plain's of Ashford was glitched, with some Vistas not working and some 80 lvl branded spawning. Not sure if it was coincidence or real mistake like jungle bugs, but who knows?
---
 The story from current position can take us anywhere. Maybe tomorrow we'll see some hint current-event style.

You replied to the wrong comment.

Well, i would give my solo arah runs for one of those any time :).

Wouldn't it be closer to a Riftstalker, given that it comes from another dimension?
---
You should look at guides at Snow Crows and Metabattle for that, but Mirage rotation itself isn't very hard at all.
---
Joko doesn't emanate as much magic as an Elder Dragon and relies much more on psychology and his cult. Joko needs zealots who extend his magical influence onto his followers out of their own free will as opposed to slaves who will just be an upkeep.
---
Zhaitan practically overflows with "death magic", so his slaves are constantly getting overwhelmed by his will.
---
I can understand quitting GW2, but for WoW? Absolutely pathetic.
---
Blizzard has been nothing but a factory for soulless and shallow garbage for at least the past decade.
---
On the skins he has a point, though.
---
Power is the stat that penetrates toughness.  It negates toughness at a 1:1 ratio.  Very easy math there.
---
Armor in League of Legends functions very differently than toughness.  One point of armor increases your EHP by 1%.  100 armor gives you 50% damage reduction (200% EHP).  200 armor gives you 66.7% damage reduction (300% EHP).
---
He will play wow classic, as mentioned in every single stream for the last weeks. You could have just asked him.
---
What am i looking at?
---
I think a lot of people are attracted to WoW classic because they miss the older mentality of games.
---
Personally I think Mightyteapot should rejoin all of us in GW1, lol.
---
Swapping to WoW classic.
---
I really don’t understand why he would quit playing GW2 for WoW. Battle for Azeroth is *really* lackluster, at least as of 8.2 (the current patch). From both a mechanical execution and game design standpoint, WoW is flopping on all fronts. Even the systems that seemed good in theory (daily system for Nazjatar, Heroic Warfronts) just don’t feel rewarding. Couple that with atrocious class design, and BFA really isn’t worth spending any time on.
---
I could understand if he was quitting for BFA but its understandable to quit GW2 for Classic WoW especially when you've played GW2 for as long as he has.
---
[removed]
---
I'm curious, how long are you playing - what does the /age command says?
---
To have fun with friends.
---
I think its for classic WoW.
---
You should have logged in for some of those episodes, before the current one there were all other PoF ones for free in the shop ...
---
Also they only cost like 200 gems, thats less than 70g so you should be able to buy one episode per day if you're only doing you T4 fractal dailys once and sell your bank. You can easily make gold in this game.
---
Doing your daily fractals takes about 1hour and is easily puggable on EU and NA albeit europe has the bigger playerbase. Since you can pug them with randoms its supercasual and the LFG tool is allways filled from 10h morning until reset. So whenever you come home there should be several groups in LFG wich are looking for the usual suspects: Firebrigade, Chrono, ~~Druid~~(healer), Banner &amp; dps. So if you want a shortcut just fill one of those essential roles and you dodge queue times by a lot.
---
If you can play for more than an hour daily you can go for some worldbosses or Istan, RIBA etc.
---
You should be able to buy one episode daily or at least every two days if you're really lazy or unlucky with dropps. 
---
Maging gold here is supercasual and laidback, quit your bitching.

---
How is Mightyteapot a dramaqueen?
---
you can stick your head in the sand all you want, keep pretending like it's not a symptom of a larger issue and soon enough you will be one of the 100 people who still play the game. people don't criticise the game because they hate it, they criticise it because they want it to get better, get that through your thick skulls.
---
Pranks and hate solve everything.
---
Translation: they never played them and think they have nostalgia for how grindy and tedious they are.
---
80% of people who are talking about how diehard they'll be in WoW Classic are going to quit after a week when they realize you can't progress at all without absurd time investment.
---
There's a reason that raiding Naxxramas almost made me drop out of college.
---
"Fine" is relative.  When you compare something which is over-performing to other things which also over-perform, of course it looks normal.
---
What ANet is doing is going back and adding stronger trade-offs to elite specs vs. core.  This time it was Chronomancer (which had absolutely none before).  Eventually they'll go back and fix (i.e. nerf) PoF specs.
---
ill just pretend it doesnt exist
---
Would anyone know if there is a fix for the green textures? I just installed and everything is green or purple and flashing.
---
don't bother with the crybabies who can't take criticism of their beloved game. they don't understand that criticism = / = trolling
---
people who have never experienced the real world and don't realise that criticism is how you take note of faults and correct them.
---
And that's why all these quitters need to come back to ol' good boi Gw1, YEAH BOI!
---
I might be in the minority when it comes to this particular topic (regarding the current state of the game), and I'll go ahead and qualify my statement by saying that I have definitely invested far less time into the game than Teapot, Deroir, WP, etc. have. That being said, I suppose you could consider me one of the potential "new personalities" since my stream has been steadily growing over the past few months (I'm getting about 50\~ average viewers) and I have quite a bit of time (about 2k\~ hours) invested, so perhaps I can maybe shed some insight?
---
The guys that you mentioned, and Teapot especially, have brought a lot into the community that literally no one else has before, but when you play a game for thousands and thousands of hours, you're going to burn out of it eventually. Personally I'm quite glad that Teapot is moving away from the game because in my opinion, his way of playing game is very narrow-minded due to the fact that he was limited to "hardcore" end game content. There's nothing wrong enjoying difficult content, and he's certainly brought a lot to the new player community through his raid guides. However, GW2 has had a history of catering to newer players, and there's plenty of ways to have fun with that and I think a lot of the "old blood" in the twitch community isn't able to enjoy those things literally because they're unwilling to.
---
The problem is: This negative attitude that I'm talking about bleeds over very heavily into the Twitch community, from what I've noticed. The jaded attitude is infectious and a lot of the same regulars that I see in the hardcore community are stuck in an echo chamber where they only hear the negativity, and as such, their opinions are reinforced by it. Some people could argue that this is because that's just the state of the game, but I actually disagree. My stream caters MUCH more to the newer player community, and you often see faces in my stream that you literally see in no other GW2 streamer's community because I'm streaming *different content*. In the past few months alone, I've introduced a solid amount of new players into the game, and there's very, very little overall negative opinion of the game amongst my old and new regulars.
---
I'm not saying that Teapot and et al needs to enjoy the same things that I do, but when all you do is raids and fractals, very few games will be able to keep up with that. I've found plenty of success running HP trains, Map Completion trains, designing achievement trains and new paths, Fractal/Raid trainings, general GW2 shenanigans (such as first person fractal CMs or chasing around newer players on a naked character with a birthday blaster), drawing stuff on stream, playing marbles with GW2 related giveaways, networking, etc. The fact that I've never, ever seen a "top" GW2 streamer do anything outside a specific subset of content is very telling, in my opinion.
---
Of course, thoughts are welcome! I have nothing to do for the next hour, so feel free to let me know if you disagree with me.
---
If you hate boring early game, this is better for you. As someone who actively plays both games, it's a real chore to get to the "good stuff" in FFXIV, since dungeons and raids are locked behind story progress, which is fairly slow and filled with fetch quests.
---
That being said, GW2 does have plenty of filler as well, though you'll be able to skip around most of it to get to the stuff you really want to play if you're antsy. FFXIV has a bit more in terms of content, though, so once you *do* reach end game there, it would probably keep you entertained for longer.
---
yeah, new world is month if not years from release away.
---
If you tell people to dodge or cc you're being toxic here :)
---
Are you ok?
---
He is wrong about certain things. For example he still thinks that ArenaNet is a great company and everything that happens in GW 2 is just a design choice to make money. Focusing on living story and casual players, no hard or competitive content, ignoring the PvP and WvW community, and so on.
---
In fact, what happens in GW 2 is a direct consequence of who is working in positions of influence at ArenaNet. You can't have a great game without great people in charge. Just reading through the glassdoor reviews will give you an idea of what a dumpster fire of leftist mediocrity and diversity ArenaNet has become.
---
"Inclusive, liberal workplace. Promotion is based on who you're friends with or who you're married to/dating rather then management being able to identify skills within personnel."
---
"[..] company culture, emphasis on [..] diversity. Key management do not seem to know what their goals are. Very little accountability"
---
"[..] huge failures of leadership. Very casual workplace. Think people with blue hair [..]"
---
"This company is one of the most diverse, accepting places I have ever worked. Tons of women and minorities in prominent leadership positions."
---
Do I need to go on? Compare ArenaNet to Square Enix, who have just released the most critically acclaimed FFXIV expansion ever. Scoring 92 on metacritic, a 9.2 rating by users, among the top three best rated games of the year. 
---
There are no rabid liberals working at Square Enix. No diversity hires. Their trailers display a wonderful phantasy universe, without trying to be politically correct and shoving some diversity quota down our throat.
---
This is why ArenaNet and GW 2 will not survive in the long run. Sorry to say.
---
Again?
---
Thanks!
---
Well, this is why you don't make shitty jokes about being a pedophile. Know your audience.
---
&gt; Personally I am concerned at the direction of the GW2 community at the moment. A lot of ArenaNet partners and content creators seem to either be quitting the game or becoming extremely cynical about GW2 right now. 
---

I agree with WP: Roamers being mostly gankers is cancer for WvW. And mount added a tiny bit of balance, when thief trying to nuke noob players out of stealth has to actually work a tiny bit for it. But hey, whatever, given current population drain.
---
Maybe I didn’t explain it well but my intent is that Chrono should be equal to *either* Quickbrand or Alacrigade, but not equal to both simultaneously.  Chrono should be an effective standin for either of those builds, but not an effective standin for both.
---
That means the following comps should all be equally viable:
---
* Quickness Chrono + Alacrity Renegade
---
* Alacrity Chrono + Quickbrand
---
* Quickbrand + Alacrigade
---
Does that clarify it better?
---
&gt; Think people with blue hair [..]
---
&gt; This is why Arenanet ... will not survive in the long run
---
Yeah I agree, any company with blue haired employees cant possibly be successful.
---
I agree the game is turning into a casual dumpster fire but you seem to be blaming their emphasis on corporate diversity as the reason why, and really there is no evidence for that. That's you finding something you disagree with, then making a connection to an outcome you dont like, and then creating a causal link that there is no evidence to support.
---
this is some solid bait.
---
tried to do the same nickname in overwatch.. they just changed it to PLAYER because its not THAT dark and edgy
---
Why would anyone watch you press F in open world lmao
---
In order to have more personalities rise, you need to have a game that's interesting enough for people to watch instead of play, right?  Game wide, things are too boring to watch.  Nothing exciting in PvP or WvW anymore.
---
I think GuildWars 2 is a decent game to play, but would be better if Anet gave more attention to all game types.  After playing the main storyline, you have raids, PvP, and WvW to fill in the time between story seasons.  It seems all content outside of the main story is a new raid boss twice a year, and a mount in WvW as new content in the last 2 years.  And putting new content behind the gem store is not really great.
---
People are just getting burned out from playing too much. It happens with any game.
---
Time. Lots of time. :P
---
If you seriously think child predation is something to joke about, you need to throw your sense of humor in the trash and start over

My personal theory on this what that the art comes from a time during Revenant's development where it might have actually been able to use Daggers, it wouldn't be the first time that something got scrapped in development.
---
&gt; Think people with blue hair [..]"
---
Screw the rules. I have green hair.
---
Likewise. I did one a few years ago, got my icy footprints, and swore off crafting forever. A few sets of ascended armor later, I’m over my hatred of crafting and I’m some dungeon runs and farming away from my second. I expect I’ll stop there because: scrub pride. Also, I have other stuff to do with my time!

Every man and their dog will probably play classic - I'm trying it. 
---
I do wonder how many will stick though. Retail will go back to retail, and everyone will go back to whatever else they were playing or something new.
---
It's a fad. A once in a lifetime thing probably. The game is janky as ass too - it's still wow. It's a meme at this point.
---
We'll all have fun for a few weeks / months, and gw2 is doing sweet FA at the moment anyway.
---
Cairn was there first raid boss I ever killed and I unlocked the mastery line upon doing so.
---
Wow that difference is amazing.
---
My point is that it's all about the PEOPLE behind the product. Is that so hard to understand? 
---
Very few people were capable of designing a nuclear weapon in 1942, everyone understands this. 
---
Can anyone design a great MMO in 2019? Should a gaming company hire the absolutely best or the most diverse workforce? Who should be put in charge?
---
I enjoyed my second precursor much more than the first. I took my time the second time around.
---
But who is on Twitch with GW2? 
---
I have the game stickied so I can constantly see viewers. Fuck all watch on twitch.
---
The Division 2 has consistently higher numbers, and GW2 rarely cracks 800 viewers. Sometimes 1000-1500 when some event is on, or Teapot.
---
For GW2 twitch is almost irrelevant.
---
Which is bad and good. Bad because it needs more exposure, but good because low numbers mean it doesn't matter what happens on there because 95% of players in the game never see it anyway.
---
WoW Classic is technically "New MMO", well not new new, but it's a fresh start, and if blizzard handles it right, lots of people will flow there.
---
Every legendary weapon and armor piece in the the game.  It’s basically pure insanity.
---
This is too level headed for this sub.
---
Meme also works rather well for Morhou when your focused on who your fighting and all of the sudden some wanker snipes you.
---
Reminds me of all the Hearthstone streamers saying they'd quit for Artifact. Lmao.
---
IF one is new you have to show you are willing to learn. If you ask and you at least have exotics with the proper prefixes and a decent build and watched the fight on youtube that really show people you give a shit.

&gt;" **Most people don't know what they're doing here. I'm sure they got hired because of the referral process. Many employees are friends and/or family members. If you're not friends with the upper management say goodbye to your hours. From Full-time to Part-time in less than two weeks. My coworker has been at an entry level for 4 years. The pay is also very low for a SR xxxxxxx position but it's time to look else where.** "

&gt;that's on square's glassdoor.  
---
&gt;also blue hair is not an indicator if a company is doing well or not.   
---
&gt;ofc there are problems in almost every workplace and arenanet is not an exception.   
---
&gt;anyway 5/10 cause you tried.
---
Yea, you can say no subscription, but still fact remains, kind of sucks there are no rewards for actually playing the game. You have raids and CM, but then there isnt really anything special for it. Compare to most MMOs where you get the top end or some of the most coveted gear/skins.
---
Not sure how it will end up like Anthem since Blizzard is just re-releasing a game and drip feed content that’s already there while Anthem is a new game built from the ground up through sweatshop production cycle.
---
Whilst there is probably various lore reason to answer the OP’s question, this is probably literary oversight more than anything else.  “What happens after the bad guy has been defeated” is generally something the ANET writers have traditionally overlooked in the Guild Wars series.  For example we still don’t know what happened to the Margonites after Abaddon was defeated in Guild Wars Nightfall.  
---
The Dragon Minions are probably more confusing though because they introduced a plot line in Season 3 where the other Elder Dragons can inherit the powers of the dead Elder Dragons.  In all honesty, it’s going to be very hard for future writers to try and resolve this in a way that doesn’t involve Taimi or Aurene magically fixing things.  
---
From a literary perspective, I reckon they should have written the story so that the Dragon minions crumble to dust or something after the Elder Dragon is defeated.  This is so that you could avoid a “there must always be a Lich King” type storyline to control the minions after the after the Elder Dragon is defeated.  It would also make it easier for future writers to move onto new storylines set in past locations as they wouldn’t write additional dialogue to “explain away things”.

Yesterday I did some solo roaming for basicly the first time and damn do I hate the mount. Free melee engage for the enemy while I have to waste a dodge to avoid the damage, people +1ing me out of nowhere, kill someone at their camp and they came back before I can flip it.
---
I think the back piece is from fractals (not sure tho)    
---
The wvw chest piece is the one that gives the glowy tentacles.
---
Some people learn faster then others which can effect progress speeds in learning. In a good training group you can go through it pretty well but others it's a chore which really sucks if out of 8 trainees (you included) 5 get mechanics down well but 3 just can't make any progress that slows shit down for everyone.
---
There are whiney, trolly people on most servers, at the moment TC is up against a Tier 1 Stacked Server Borliss Pass, they will be gone next reset, and then Tier 3 can relax and have fun again.
---
Gw2efficiency.com ftw
---
Is it possible to see how many hours you’ve played the game?
---
&gt; I really want to play it, because I love it. But every time I log on, I feel lost and not sure what to do and it annoys me :( 
---
And asking a bunch of strangers on the internet will do nothing to change that. I have played other MMO's and on other Reddit's I see the same thing. And frankly it's just attention seeking nonsense. You are feeling jaded. The game has gone stale for you. It happens.
---
So take a step back. Why on earth would you want to *force* yourself to do something you no longer enjoy as relaxation/entertainment? Just take a breath and think about that for a minute. Because that is what you want to do. And it's stupid.
---
No one knows what you like or don't like to do. Not any more than you know what I might or might not enjoy. And it seems quite obvious to me that the things you enjoyed about the game aren't grabbing you anymore. So walk away for a while. Play something else. I played a game for years and got quite stale. One day I just didn't log in. 4 years later I downloaded it again on a whim and it was great. People take breaks from games, it's the nature of the beast.
---
But I will tell you this : if you think that a bunch of strangers on the internet hold the answers to what will make you happy then you have bigger problems than just being a bit stale over an enjoyable game.
---
You legend. I think this man deserves a Gamer of the Year award.
