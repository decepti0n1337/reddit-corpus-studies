Oh nice, how did you get arcdps to track all the non-offense boons like protection etc? I'd love to see it lol, I've wanted that feature for a hot minute.  You're right though, you overstack boons with scrapper even if you don't have concentration. You could do nomads too pretty successfully if you wanted to add some hp for double Herald groups
---
---
---
Are you ranking them based on Core builds? Or with HoT? Or PoF?
---

---
Bc Core Engi is definitely damn hard, while HS is a lot easier to play.
---
Same with Mesmer - There isn't much you can actually do wrong with Core, while Chrono (CS) and Mirage (Dodging as main damage source) can be pretty hard to grasp.
---
Another example would be Thief - While Core and Deadeye rely a lot on stealth (And can use that as defense as well), you basically entirely drop it for DD and replace it with slightly better (And harder to use) dodges, which make survival a lot harder imo, bc you can't lose "aggro" (In PvE and PvP) that easily.
---
TL;DR: Imo it would be more meaningful to rank specializations instead of classes.
---
Maybe putting thief as a hard profession comes from Daredevil having the most damage output while having no available dodges, which is a horrible mechanic.
---
The whole point of aurene is that she replaced the corrupt and evil crystal dragon and is proof that dragons can be good so aurene becoming cOrRupTeD would just feel like bullshit.
---
Tbh I wouldnt put thief on same level as ele and mesmer. It's rather simple class that only needs skill for mastering it in pvp modes.
---
What? Did you ever see a Deadeye spamming Rifle-3? And it's not like DD was the only build to utilize dodge as DPS source
---
I mean I think one of your problems is focusing too much on symbolism you go really into detail but to make a great face you can do so in a lot less strokes
---
Yes, this is the new chair mount with integrated cup holder.
---
I agree; it’s definitely something I can improve upon. Lately I’ve been using reference, so maybe my task needs to be to simplify.
---
Thief feels like an easy class
---
Haven't they ignored big raid community events that attracted more attention than GW2's own presence on media channels? And the reason some said was that it was competitive or hardcore content that they didn't want to support?
---
skiiney, where's my CM training ?
---
You can't compare a new raid wing with removing language restrictions in WvW. A new raid is a major thing for raiders. Different links (with language barriers) is no content. A major balance patch is WvW content.
---
Ranking systems like this are always pretty useless since they don't account for specializations and specific builds. An example opinion of mine, heal tempest is probably one of the easiest professions in the game (in every game mode) while FA weaver is ridiculously high skill ceiling in sPvP.
---
The game is in a crucial moment of its life right now. Actual information is needed.
---
You must down to 2 man it.
---
Just don't participate.
---
I've never done many fractals and mainly played solo till recently. Don't even have discord. Will download it and maybe give you a shout. Are you happy with casual players?
---
Still get pretty big fps lag. Frustrating that this game still cannot run decently on wine on my machine. Probably the shader loading is screwing things up. 
---
Anyone know if we can and how to enable the ACO compiler instead of LLVM?
---
You get hit by one circle - instant death.   People loved it.   Was challenging open world content.   Stuff that would be raid only now.
---
*But where the bosses updated so they don't die in 5 seconds?*
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That's my biggest issue, personally. The core world bosses are too horribly underpowered.
---
Oh no
---
Skiiney.exe stoped working.
---
mesmer, harder professions 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
dude, mantra burst is not hard to do , and if you're referring to holo , that should be placed in easier professions
---
in reality, its like this esp in forms of meta or remotely close to meta builds.
---
Easier: Spellbreaker , Holo / Bunker Scrapper , Soulbeast, Firebrand , Scourge , Condi Mirage, Mantra Burst 
---
Intermediate: Reaper (to stay alive, dealing damage is brainless combo setups but to stay alive is different story), Sage Weaver i say mostly because besides burns it's pressure isn't TOO insane but still a decent skirmish build when you get good with it
---
Hard: Thief, Revenant
---
We're talking about actually high level gameplay... revenant is much harder than any of the other classes besides thief to actually pull off. Anybody can +1 port and setup the typical 4 /5 sword burst but to go beyond that is and micro energy on top of survivability is much harder than people think.
---
Calm down ~~Zhaitan~~ Satan.
---
They did update rewards. So it isn't the exact same at all.
---
Granted, they didn't update rewards in the way most players actually would prefer (a currency that let's them buy from a vendor dedicated to the reoccurring rush events, akin to Mordrem Blooms).
---
I still posit they are cowcats and always will.
---
Considering how old the game is, I'm impressed that they can even keep new content coming on a fairly consistent schedule. I still like a lot of the old content and tolerate pvp and wvw because I'm not very good and it's still challenging for me. (Also, working on legendary that requires playing that stuff.) I also haven't fully absorbed a lot of the old content either. I took a long break a while back and missed stuff as it was coming out and have yet to catch up on it all.
---
I'm actually a bit disappointed they didn't just make that part of the community events instead of attaching them to the raid. Expand over time to all 16 terrestial weapons with an upgradeable version, part of the community rush events, and bam, unique rewards for motivation.
---
I might join you guys on some runs.  I need more money and materials.
---
No.
---
This is already a problem in the speedclear community, that, due to balance patches, many kill times are now unreachable. Regardless of bugging out bosses/random exploits that might be patched, there’s something to be said for the fact that ele had a 43k benchmark and now has 35k. It’s impossible to predict how balance changes will change the attainability of old kill times.
---
That's a lot of upvotes, very quickly.
---
Okay, again, I love this game, but this is so bad. It's not as bad as the North American launch trailer, and it's DEFINITELY not as bad as their weird Taxi thing someone linked in another thread:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk717LQnpVE&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk717LQnpVE&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Get ready to cringe
---
omg this is glorious
---
ffs!
---
Dis POINTY STICC
---
It’s fitting tho, cuz outfits are to fashion warz as these are to cosplay.
---
What? PvE and WvW (as well as PvP) are all balanced separately for classes.
---
Ugh leggings are not a replacement for trousers
---
Everyone wants infusions and shiny things, not more useless materials and bags.
---
If chairs are mounts -- and they are -- then why is it at all surprising that they have the option for movement to be toggled on? If anything, the fact that chairs are mounts makes this *not* surprising in the least.
---
Pretty big oversimplification. While mesmer may be complex in some builds, playing Mirage is braindead easy.
---
You say Daredevil yet you just described Deadeye.
---
With no context this image alone is misleading in many ways, especially for new players.
---
Beginners should always always always, make a bunch of classes they could be interested in and take them into the sPvP lobby to read their skills, traits, specializations (if they have expansions) etc to get a feel for the flavor of the class.
---
There are easy builds to start with for all classes, and end game build difficulty can be learned in time if the player wants to commit to a class.
---
Okey, this really is a good idea. One week only, motivational, no lore explanation needed, probably a good way to reintroduce season 1 expansive items.
---
Looks horrible imo.
---
Maybe double tokens for dungeons/fractals. 
---
It might sound small, but thinking back to GW1 week events, their purpose weren't typically an economic benefit, but rather a progression benefit.
---
On top of that, DR will hit you eventually through the event.  My friends were doing this, by the time we got to 25 stacks, the 26th-30th weren't giving boxes so we gave up.
---
Why? It's the best. It makes you throw birbs at people.
---
&gt;everything maxed but post processing (ugly) and character models.
---
Why though? Those two have next to no impact on FPS.
---
Shadow quality and model limit are much more significant.
---
Add trib mode traps and tribulation cloud spawns.
---
problem is that apart from Art assets, audio and text, its almost a from the bottom up redesign of programming, rigging, testing and all that stuff due to engine and tool changes. Basically any LS1 events would require something along the lines of an entire current LS episodes worth of resources or more acc. to comments from Anet folks over the last couple of years
---
Can you mount while downed?
---
The quaggan is giving me serious Mr. Meseeks vibes
---
Same with thief, but it's a little trickier, as you have to actually aim for the ground just before hitting it to shadowstep safely
---
Well said.
---
I meant model limit, character quality is maxed. Post processing is disabled because it blows out all of the highlights and adds a green outline to your selection. Shadow quality has been much less of an issue since swapping to D912pxy. I don’t know if it’s just very parallel friendly, or what, but it barely affects performance for me.
---
If this subreddit excels at anything, then it is needlessly panicking over any news (and sometimes even over no news at all) over and over and over again. Just let it ride out, ignore these topics, play the game instead. It's vastly better for your mental health, believe me.
---
My wife and I have Largos characters too. I hate when I can't see the infusions and wings on my character on the character select screen, and she just looks like some chick...
---
I'm with people I want some sort of blog on season 5 but I'm not concerned about the game. Even if things being added are repeats till season 5 begins its still content.
---
Agreed on the save mode, could be fun to push it even further if it scaled of course.
---
However I am fundamentally against much solo content in an MMORPG, so I probably wouldn't want to see a toned down version. You can definitely solo these bosses to a decent round tbh with something like power chrono or just plain old scourge.
---
god no
---
I doubt they would ever do fractals just because any change in the relics you get from dailies would speed up fractal god, which is currently one of the few "accomplishment" titles in the game. Plus, fractals arent the easiest content (if you join a random non-CM pug...of people who do them regularly), infusing a bunch of non-fractal people into fractals (and most will try to jump straight into T4, no doubt) will destroy the non-CM experience for the regulars for however long the event lasts--CM will probably still be fine since every group there requires a hefty ess KP and it becomes pretty easy to spot totally new people in CM100, where most groups start.
---
If rangers can use their f1-f4 while downed i want to use my photon forge while downed!!!
---
The only new SAB we will see.
---
Sounds like an average night of RP in the grove, just player ran :)
---
Hey bro, try Reaper!
---
Necros have a very easy time in lower to mit tier fractals (even endgame T4s too) if they just go fullzerk Reaper. They're very sturdy and carry a lot of boon uptime for themselfes. Look for a [Guide](https://discretize.eu/builds/necromancer/power-reaper)!
---
If you insist on playing Condi you're just effectively gimping yourself since without Viper your duration is halved and therefore your damage too. You can go for Viper anytime but starting out its better to stick to Power builds since berserker set aquisition is easy and way cheaper than comparable sets.
---
As for keeping stuff from fractals ... usually just salvage everything and sell the rest. Fractal potions are worth keeping tho but only the greater ones, the cheap shit can be vendored for relics. Just look around the sanctum lobby.
---
This games aesthetic is going further and away from what I appreciated about it, on an almost daily basis. Like another poster here, I'm starting to feel quaint and out of place, wearing armor and weapons that don't have crazy special effects. I don't understand at all what possessed Anet to head in this direction.
---
I think you're on to something.  The ears would be a bit more spot on.
---
The cerebro photo is great!
---
Correct - the "core" version of the game hasn't been available to buy on it's own for some time. In order to upgrade a F2P account you just need either expac and link the serial to your account.
---
not yet no, but according to their blog post more items will be made available again as the week progresses - so keep checking each day!
---
&gt; Its dangerous to go alone
---
whenever I read this I think about [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m9QUoW5KnY)
---
There are many people over the years that I have been on discord with that only listen.  If that would help you, then give it a try if you're the slightest bit interested.  If it's a bad experience, then you have only lost a little bit of time.  But if it's good, then it might open up a new game mode that can make you some gold and fun at the same time.
---
Warrior is not easy.
---
On their website, the other leggings are around $40+ ... not worth it to me, but if you really like 'em get them.
---
I mean, I've bought dumber shit...
---
Anet knows exactly what they want to do and always have. They simply don't tell us. It's been like this for a long time. Not sure why anyone is panicking about it now.
---
Why isBatman a god here?
---
It's not like ArenaNet didn't think of it. They made the decision not to invest a huge amount of resources into content that players would play once and a majority of players wouldn't do all of it (maybe some will do all classes but not everyone will).
---
It makes more sense to try to expand the specialisation weapon collection to incorporate a little more spec specific content (maybe design events around the world that have extra dialogue if that elite spec is there, like helping a renegade channel Kalla, an event everyone can do but with bonus dialogue, or even a follow up event, for someone of that spec).
---
I mean I'm of the opinion that if you want to ascribe d&amp;d characters to lord of the rings you should be careful about what edition you're talking about. in some editions basically the only class that even *could* use a bow was ranger. in say, 1e d&amp;d he's an "elf".
---
also you say 'majority', but of the 4 people who posted top level comments 2 say ranger and 2 say fighter.
---
You say that but most pugs can NOT play mirage to save their lives.   
---
 An example from a recent ish pug I was on. [https://dps.report/tPvM-20190701-143753\_matt](https://dps.report/tPvM-20190701-143753_matt)
---
Tsk! You say "3 dudes licking a schlong" like its a bad thing!
---
LOL! We need someone who has a charr cosplay to model a pair of these leggings. That'd be brilliant. xD
---
why would it be a bad idea?
---
This needs more upvotes!  &lt;3
---
Good effort and metrics, but I'm with the others on the ease of the rules.
---
How about:
---
No mounts.
---
No gear except weapons with no stats.
---
No waypoints.
---
No deaths.
---
No mail, bank, or TP except to deposit.
---
No gathering or crafting.
---
No hero points spent.
---
Do core Tyria map completion.
---
in pve it's super easy with 2 axes you just spam your adrenaline skill and you don't even need to weapon swap
---
that only rules out the all-time leaderboard. a patch leaderboard would be more appropriate for raids and fractals
---
I really hope not. Considering their last "break" from the Dragon Plot gave us the incredibly cringe Scarlet that's not a good path to walk.
---
In short, the times would get exploited and Arenanet wouldn't bother to fix exploits/remove the broken times.
---
I must note that I personally -love- the idea of leaderboards for instanced content, but Arenanet would do a half-assed job and then leave it in the dust to rot because "we prefer to focus on newer content". 
---
It won't work because fuck Arenanet.
---
Yes, how dare they spend minimal developer resources to repurpose existing content to give players something different to do while they wait between releases. That's so much better than absolutely nothing between releases because making new content would only delay major releases.
---
I get it - old world bosses are pretty boring, I think so too, but it's something that took them very little resources to do, it temporarily livens up the daily routine of a lot of players who wouldn't normally play that content and it helps out with the current focus of a lot of players (skyscale grind).
---
No MMO is dumping out a new dungeon or map every other week, no MMO is dropping major balance patches frequently, every MMO is filled with people complaining about game balance (ESO, WoW, BDO, GW2 - every community complains about balance most of the time).
---
Yeah I am currently writing a book, but I would say I'm a very casual writer.
---
I think about the novel I'm writing almost all the time, do it in my spare time mostly, always bounce off ideas and talk to people to the point it's annoying, yet I am still unconcerned. I don't think it will lead anywhere, and I think  it will only be interesting to a handful of people so I would say I'm a casual writer.
---
Thing is though, casual is a different definition to everyone.
---
He got the legendary loot, the  Mobius Chair, and became the God of knowledge. It is from the Justice League Darkseid War, where the JL became gods.
---
Casual has one definition...not taking something seriously. That's the definition. Since no one can know whether I'm taking something seriously or not, only I'm qualified to say that I'm casual. Other people are just drawing unwarranted conclusions. If you say you're casual about your writing, who am I do disagree, whatever my definition. I can't know how you feel.
---
That's amazing. I've been thinking about finding a guild or a community dedicated to running fractals, as I've been wanting to give CM's a try.
---
I wouldn't even call Peachy a gw2 streamer a this point. 
---
Potatoes has lost a lot of traction on twitch but I do think he's trying to revitalise his channel.
---
Teapot is the biggest consistent gw2 streamer though yeah, hands down.
---
Jaw was still very prominent though, often in the top 3 at any given time of streaming.
---
Making raids repeatable, making CMs repeatable should come first. Then... MAYBE when gw2 gets back an active raid scene leaderboards would be nice. Atm the raidscene is dead. Leaderboards useless.
---
those kinds of comments are not helpful. and even if they don't do that, the community can just ignore those bosses/wings/fractals
---
FINALLY we have wheelchairs!
---
Now the title Armchair Commander has a purpose!
---
it will never take off if it's not inside the game. there are loads of examples of failed websites
---
I see a lot of new player guides trying to tier professions like this based on difficulty, when the difficulty of a class is so dependent on both the build and what you're trying to output with it. Pretty much all professions have easier and harder builds, and I don't think these rankings are particularly useful for newer professions deciding what they want to play.
---
just because the raiding scene isn't as competitive as it once was doesn't mean leaderboards wouldn't breathe new life into it
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH ! JUST ... THANK YOU VERY MUCH ! \*-\*  
---
I'm just speechless.
---
Kinda disappointed tbh, this style of design is my least favourite out of all their leggings designs :(
---
Not really possible to do in time for the world boss rush unless they already did it, and I'd rather they'd bring it back as part of a guild mission revamp update and/or Season 1 return.
---
are mounts allowed in that area? should be easier with them now :D
---
That's fairly reasonably priced for a pair of high quality printed leggings
---
I dont understand, please someone cant explain?
---
Just because there was bullshit doesn’t mean there needs to be more.
---
YAY! I can finally try fractals with others without being afraid or concerned about being judged by others! :D (this is what I get from pretty much living in WvW...)
---
He’s not discussing balance he’s discussing a type of matchmaking
---
except if you play heavy armor user.
---
There isnt a single chrono left at the end
---
Rifle one maybe, but it's literally the only complex build on thief there, which hardly makes the whole class hard ro play. 
---
The picture itself is not very clear with its purpose either. Is it class difficulty overall, difficulty to get into class or mastering difficulty because engi, mesmer and thief have quite different scores for all of these.
---
Any new infos on the three jokers? Didn't follow for a while.
---
I’m dyingggg 💀💀💀
---
Much like flanders snow suit, this is the commoner outfit even heavy armor users can wear \o///
---
World bosses again...... yea no thanks I had enough of that shit getting my ultra shiny title.
---
Thank you. I think I'll wait for a better price. As u/ChmSteki said, if GW2 is expected to go on sale in august it'll be worth it.
---
As for the Living Chapters, I remember GW story to be decent (as you said) and I think it could be nice to have the full experience and start with season 2 :)
---
That is why they don´t give promises any more and only talk about something that is set in stone.
---
you can still get there? O: I tried to get there some time ago, but huge af invisible wall at the only entrance I know....what sorcery is this?
---
We're still in the third week of dragon bash. Four winds will come soon after I think
---
Lmao here comes all the retarded posts = well they cant its VERY technical so technical it cant happen, they could put MIT programmers and NASA coders on it and it cant be done.... its Soooooooo complex and the layers and it needs a redesign I'd estimate it would cost in the billions so no marionette!
---
I enjoyed S2; it has a nice story and some good bossfights. 
---
The beginning of it talks a lot about the end of Season 1 which was only accessible temporarily, so either read online or just push on past the first chapter. If you didn't play S1, it is a bit hard to follow what they're talking about, but that's only a temporary thing.
---
After then, the new story starts and things start to make more sense.
---
Scourge is not that easy, using epi is easy af but when it comes to be the top dps it's another story.
---
Yeah I thought cosplay was about picking the right visual elements to match ad closely as possible.
---
I can remember the threads but I cant find them anymore sadly. I have never seen the broken SAB, I wish someone would post videos.
---
&gt;Everyone I know talked about Skyrim (if they ever), Monste Hunter, Warframe, etc. 
---
Skyrim is an unfair addition to use in this argument, because when those other games die down people will still talk about skyrim
---
https://i.imgur.com/vTtRaUG.jpg
---
Oh cool, so now instead of having a raid and a fractal team producing content at the same time, we'll have both of them work at half speed or less. So instead of 1 raid and 1 fractal per 6 months, we'll get, if we're lucky, a fractal in 9 months and then a raid in another 9. Wonderful.
---
Will you be able to help me get titles if I’m already semi-experienced at the fractals? Like I know how to run level 100 at CM, but I want the title and I need a group committed to getting it done.
---
I never said anything about implementing every suggestion. I was talking about the most commonly requested suggestion - to use a currency insteas of pure rng lootboxes.
---
The issue generally has been that certain things are mentioned as what they want to do, and it's taken as a promise, even with the disclaimer at the bottom that all this is subject to change.
---
The biggest delay, issue I can remember is the legendary weapons that were supposed to come with HoT, but they weren't delivered until the end of Season 4.  That's a very long time to wait for a full set of legendary weapons. I didn't particularly care that it took a long time, but it was said those weapons would come with HoT. They didn't.
---
They also said they were going to speed up the schedule at which they released raids, and some number was given by a dev casually in an interview, and none of that materialized. 
---
The fractal leaderboard was announced and later abandoned, but none of it was promises, and it's because of this that they simply don't talk about stuff until it's ready.
---
Nope, not in our case
---
it has been more like lack of concentration or getting cornered by mechanics
---
There was nothing delayed, there is actually constant stream of stuff to do and it actually is more tiring to not have pause than other way around. it is vacation summer season, why people would expect everyone would be in their offices and be releasing huge stuff, just to not have devs around for hotfixes? 
---
Keep your breath with those useless posts until August, when they won't deliver anything for anniversary, then there will be good spot for them. Until then it is just spam without any reasoning behind it.
---
They do seem to have blocked the old known access point, but I can confirm it’s still possible to get into all the rooms including cerebro.
---
They saw the money...
---
*ANET finance team furiously copying notes*
---
Commonly request suggestions don't always get implemented, due to the time frame it would take to implement it, due to interfering with other existing plans, due to factors we don't know anything about. What you did say was, "Yet Anet listened to the community" without actually listening.
---
That's implying they didn't take note of what was being said. I simply pointed out that they didn't obey the community. You have no idea whether they listened or not.
---
Let's say that idea was suggested in that thread 12 times (and I don't know that it was). That means 12 people out of maybe a million people suggested something. Saying they didn't listen in quotes, because they didn't implement a suggestion, when they did implement other suggestions is simply provocative. 
---
There's always a bunch of people saying nerf this class, nerf that class, in probably far greater numbers than the suggestion you're talking about. It doesn't mean those suggestions are right. Some people know how to defend against them and some don't.  You see it in so many threads. This is bad, nerf it. Anet didn't nerf it, they didn't listen to the community.
---
The truth is, Anet has listened to some of the community far too much while ignoring others in the community. That's sort of how it is, since the community doesn't speak with one voice.
---
[removed]
---
30% magic find is an example I set. It could be 10% or 20% or 0%. Bear in mind some of us old players can hit up to 250%. 
---
The numbers can be worked out. The main thing is the gem offer at discount that could draw players to pay, and that would not affect a non playing player.
---
A subscription that would allow access to more content or skills or gear would be unacceptable.
---
The number of raids a year was "we hope to release 6 wings a year".  This was never a concrete promise by Anet but the community took it as a promise.
---
Do they come in XXL?
---
You say not hard to implement, yet they haven't been able to deliver the 10v10 sPvP nor Swiss matching for ATs in any timely manner. Seems like they have problems with the code or processes that is preventing them from doing a lot of stuff, unless there's money to be earned.
---
Sure it's not a promise. But it's a statement that was so far off as to be misleading in and of itself. If I said to my wife I'm going to take the dog out every day if I can, and then proceed to take the dog out once during the year, my wife would be pretty annoyed, even though I promised nothing.    
---
I hate the use of the word promise when nothing was promised, but it was still a stupid thing for the company to say if they couldn't deliver even 10% of that.
---
the fractal leaderboard would have been a method to deliver the legendary backpack, but they found another way instead.
---
What do you consider as genuine content? Seriously asking. 
---
Before there were raids there was LS1 and LS2, and the first raid was released at 2015 - more than 3 years after launch. Fractals were released late 2012, and after the addition of 5 other fractals in 2013 (all of which were either LS1 content or LS1 related) no new fractal was released for three years. Dungeons were hardly ever changed after they were released, with the exception of TA fw/up that was replaced with Aetherpath (which is also LS1 content). In comparison, open world and story has been updated and attended more regularly. 
---
So while I am not advocating that organized PvE content should be neglected, it is clear that gw2's core content has mostly been open world and story. So if you consider LS filler content you might like other games better?
---
They want to make WvW players pay gems but don't develop the large arena that literally everyone has wanted. AB arena is fine for small groups or duels but not proper group fights. 
---
They could have just copy pasted OS and sell instancesd versions of it, but they won't.
---
Yep, I'm not saying it's a big deal. I'm talking about all the "promises" they made that turned out not to happen. I don't recall any of them being promises, but stuff like this has a way of sticking in some people's minds. Keep in mind, I'm quite happy with the content delivery we're getting because it fits my play style pretty closely. I feel bad for raiders who expect raids to come out more frequently or WvWers who have been waiting for fixes for their problems for a long time.
---
I think that this would actually wall off the community even more. Why would anyone ever take suboptimal class or god forbid, newbie to raid ? They would hurt their leaderboard positions.
---
Fast forward few months, with no new blood you would have dead gamemode. It is already happening, but this would *speed it up*.
---
In other scenarios it would be nice to have, and people would get competitive to be there, but for nowadays raiding it would really be death sentence. Even for fractals, you would just make division to LFG and the amounts of groups are good now, but after? It is pretty bad gamble.
---
It would be different if you had those leaderboard runs completely separate and with no rewards. Then it would be rather one-time stuff for many, and repeatable for those that would want to climb the ladder, but it would not kill normal LFG.
---
As multiple ppl have mentionef already, we have that information. These events fill out the months between major releases
---
I would bet my fingers that season 5 is gonna be a buildup for expansion 3
---
This is part of Festival that is until tuesday in Hoelbrak (norn capital city). It is arena that scales the boss's hp and damage with each wave, but as video shows, only until wave 99.  Possibly you could run it forever but as the scaling is not continuing to scale, it would just repeat same tier again and again, so one can consider it beaten.
---
&gt; What do you consider as genuine content? Seriously asking.
---
Content that has longevity and provides a challenge. Fractals, raids, dungeons, new PvP gamemodes, full fledged minigames like sanctum sprint, and open world maps with meta events that take coordination and offer proper rewards for it (like Tarir or Triple Trouble). Eversince PoF it feels like Anet hasn't even tried to deliver on any of these and aims for the bare minimum or below.
---
I agree that dungeons for instance haven't been all that challenging. But what makes them good content for me is that in order to do them efficiently, you need to employ a specific tactic with decent builds. You get rewarded for preparing your character, learning the game, and executing the tactics well. Eventhough it's not hardcore content, you are rewarded for getting better.
---
These days Anet seems afraid to ask people to do anything. If someone playing with his feet can't do something on his first try, Anet goes into panic mode, nerfs the whole thing, and never does it again. It's sad. This game could've been so much more if Anet wasn't such a carebear company now. 
---
In the beginning there was a balance between open world and instanced content, I'd argue it was even in favor of instanced content in the first one or two years of the game if we look at the quantity of endgame content.
---
Especially these days
---
damn is this some top quality copypasta?   
---
there are more than enough training groups out there that will help you get KP while also help you getting better at raids
---
I was only pretending to be retarded, fools
---
bad bot
---
people still line up to do teq, where you have several different groups with their own tasks.
---
This is so stupid I love it. Imagine a legit race with everyone in their inquest chair. :D
---
They also have a rocket boost if you can put superspeed on them. It looks hilarious.
---
You have not mentioned Mastery Points once, but mention expansion maps. At which stage are you: more or less "just at lvl 80", or have you already played through all expansions (HoT, PoF) and LS seasons?
---
If you have not: doing that would be an obvious next goal.
---
If you have, then there are things like getting all mounts, get good in fractals and/or raids, go after a few achievements that interest you, and honestly too many things to list. But then, if you would already be at that point, you should not need to ask how to make money. And btw: Silverwastes is still one of the most profitable ways to make money.
---
I legitimately lost brain cells after reading that - i can feel it
---
Please! I was totally in love with this event yet I never had a successful run.
---
I've never seen a pair of nerdy leggings that actually looked good.
---
So, we were able to toy around with the berserker for a few years and now with power, you switch back to greatsword, a weapon that we used for 7 years. That is, if you hadn't already ran power because it's open world PvE and everything works.
---
You have skills tied to your weapon and there is a limited number of options you can run. You need to run a healing skill, an elite and 3 utilities and you are very limited in terms of available skills for those slots, along with the fact that for open world PvE, due to the nature of its design, the selection is limited even more.
---
As I have said, due to the rigid design, lower cooldowns or ever switching from power to condi (when I need to use the skills that I have been using for years now) isn't going to cut it; especially if you are in the position of having played it all or/and are simply not too thrilled with how they designed the classes.
---
These are cool and all, but I feel like not having a Sylvari style is a missed opportunity.
---
Personally, I feel microtransactions have a very niche place in the gaming industry and that is in games where players want to expand their library of options in the game. Great examples of this are the rhythm game genre and simulators. You aren't going to want every single song for Rock Band but you also don't want to be forced to buy packs of tracks you wont play for the one Iron Maiden track you want. Or you might only play iRacing for the GT3 cup so you aren't interesting in the tracks that don't appear in that series, etc.
---
Outside of that, however... I haven't seen a good reason for them to exist.
---
Uh, no? They're separate teams.
---
Who would and where would people use that ? I'm trying to think of a situation where someone wearing that would not look ridiculous but, aside from alone at home, I can't think of any.
---
Right after new items are released, mainly legendaries or large collections that come in new releases. Otherwise I wouldn't say there is really any set weekly trend and that it all just fluctuates a lot. Would be best to check https://www.gw2spidy.com/, https://www.gw2bltc.com/, or https://www.gw2tp.com/ for prices and history.
---
Thanks for the reply, and I really appreciate the advice you and everyone else has given me here. 
---
It is encouraging to read that for open world pve, which I mostly play solo while joining in on group events to take tougher enemies with the help of other players, all weapons and strategies are viable, so I should basically try out all classes, being on f2p account and having only 2 character slots means I can create only 2 characters at a time and play them for a bit then delete them and make other 2 chars with different classes :( and on every class I should try every weapon combination to find the one that suits me the most.
---
And as you say im still new to GW2 and still have a lot to learn about this game and how it plays, but I will get there with time... :)
---
Just reached lvl 80. Few mastery points. What should I do at silverwastes to get money?
---
 
---
# Aetherblade Heavy Legplates
---
Tried to do low tier ones some time ago. They are kinda fun but really particular. I still have to get used to them
---
I’m not trolling I literally watch twitch all the time Iv never seen him, that could be my fault but teapot peachy and potatos are the ppl that stand out to me, (WP literally streams everyday)
---
Thanks!
---
I mean, they came from humans...so they're just more evolved humans.
---
I am somewhat on the same boat. I don't really do raids but fractals had been the content that scratched my itch for coordinated content. But after doing 99 and 100cm for a decent time I didn't feel like continuing as I knew that we wouldn't CMs of this caliber in newer fractals.
---
Thankfully I don't really mind doing solo stuff and I kinda like WvW so I wasn't too affected. However, I sympathize with players that feel they don't have enough challenging group content.
---
To start with, what do you enjoy doing? There are raids, fractals, dungeons, story, meta events, collections, masteries, crafting, ascended gear, legendary gear, adventures, beetle/griffon races, World verses World and PvP who also have ranks, masteriers, ascended gear outside of the game mode it self. And that is just what comes on top of my head. 
---
So what do you want to focus on?
---
Then take it slow. Enjoy the scenery and listen to the dialogue. Especially because it is your first time, don't treat it as a checklist of 'heart task, point of interest, vista, done - next map'. There's so much to explore on this game.
---
Dw, as long as you understand what we are explaining to the group, it should not be a problem. We got also ppl w/o a mic and they communicate with us via ingame text chat , if you're afraid of talking with us :D
---
The rewards are so bad
---
Yea, we, talking from the EU side of the guild,  can set that up , if the demand for it is there and if enough ppl do sign up for it.
---
Hahaha
---
i love this content is still being made
---
Then first you should probably look for a guild. You can have up to 5 guilds in this game but only rep one at the time. Guilds usually have different aims so look for one that seem to be what you want.
---
Dungeons in this game are abandoned content from Devs. This means they get no updates but you can still run them for gold, exotic gear/skins and gifts (legendary crafting thing).
---
But we do have Fractals which are the dungeons in this game. There are 100 fractals divided in to 4 tiers and the higher up you get the harder it goes. There are 20 different fractals but due to instabillities they are played differently. So one fractal at lvl 20 is no the same at lvl 87 even though it is the same fractal.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractals_of_the_Mists Here is some reading about fractals and all info you need. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI4eqgIYZGM Here is a video for beginners with lots of info you need to know to get in to them.

---
Me neither, lost interest short after rebirth.
---
Holographic parts mixed with "real" parts look really weird to me and I won't be using it anyway.
---
I wish we had two simple versions instead, full holographic and full "real".
---
The idea of selling merchandise is great, i‘d love for some bags/backpacks to be released. 
---
The problem with clothing is that people tend to forget how ridiculous you look if you go outside in leggings like these, and merchandise tends to be too expensive to just wear at home.
---
So it‘s a no from me, sorry
---
&gt; I play a Charr
---
i hope you realise your mistake :p
---
I guess? It's a pretty good solution to save dev resources since things like raids and LW episodes take ages to make.
---
This is in NA though. If you are in EU we don't do resets since that is in the middle of the night for us. How ever i frequently see it being done in EU as well (i have the airship pass and there for usually see when the ley line guy pops up on Gendaran). lfg also have squads up sometimes. I know there is a guy doing it every day so maybe you can find him.
---
I just want to know what the future of the game holds.
---
I don't mean more LS or these rnadom events. LS5 is going to be the same as LS4 (diff topic obviously), but if they think that'll fly going forward, that's going to suck large.
---
The game seems so directionless right now.
---
Dat Astralaria tho. Nice work
---
I always think Crafting my own Legendary is more fulfilling but I totally getcha!
---
I usually just get the parts I have to get myself for the Journey, Like Gift of Battle, Gift of Exploration, Gift of the Jungle Regions, Obsidian Shards, Spirit Shards, Faction Provisioner Tokens, Meta Event Rewards, Precursor Quests, etc!
---
But when it comes to stuff like Gift of Might and Magic that just needs straight up T6 Mats or whatever. I just buy that shit. Can't be fucked to grind all that out as well.
---
I believe it was Chelsea who worked on IPOS if I recall correctly.
---
imagine your team is afk in the base while you see only their teef on close with your own necro and then complain being oneshot while standing afk on far flaming in the chat about balance.
---
I dont have ultra instinct btw. I died in 0.30 secs in the video. Human average reaction time is 0.25 -0.30 secs. If u have ultra instinct to be able to counter that in time good for you, but know that is not balanced
---
Wow! That is a reaction I didn't expect. Thank you for your kind words! I 'm always happy to help and it is a great feeling knowing that someone appreciates it. Thank you!!
---
One way to bring the boss back without having to rework the map again could be 'Fractal Rifts'.
---
You would go to the spot with the remnants of the marionette, find a portal there, and enter it to go to a separate shared instance like the one where several players can fight a Riftstalker. 
---
Once inside, every 3 hours sometime between other bosses in the Hardcore Boss rotation.
---
By having it in a separate shared instance instead Lornar's Pass, they can make the rules of the instance the same as in other older instance, and so the design would not have to worry about gliders and mounts.
---
Fractal rifts could also be used to let people revisit old LA, replay the karka invasion in LA, the ancient karka attack in Southsun, the S1 events like Frost&amp;Flame tubes and Kesse'x Nightmre tower,  Scarlet's events in LA, and so on.
---
It would also allow making changes to maps in the future without losing presvious states of the map, and thus ANet would no longer have to be limited by "maps are stuck in time" kind of designs.
---
I saw none of this.... But disappointed I was left out!
---
Oh, this sounds great! I'm on EU, and I'd like to try this next weekend. I hope, it's not too late by then.
---
I have to play other classes because of anet incompetence to balance?
---
The point of the video is to show what monstruosity anet created
---
Maybe people trying to farm mosaics? Need a bunch for the legendary items.
---
They are bringing back the newer Halloween skins on sale too
---
yeah I can't imagine trying to find a top that doesn't look ridiculous, I guess this is why they don't let us mix and match outfits ;)
---
Maybe be aware of the area behind you you didn't turn back once and gave him every opportunity to instantly kill you. Every soulbeast, warrior or even thief could have killed you in 1 second, because you paid 0 attention to your surroundings. Even when he was invisible, he needed to walk somewhat in range. Also burst mesmer is easy to counter with just 1 or 2 dodges while being aware of them. After that they instantly die because they got nothing left..
---
Unpopular opinion incoming. There is no need for another worldboss that would be cleaved down. Sure it once was challenging but only because it came during a time where ppl had not figured out the game. Not in the slightest. Not to mention the power creep. Instead of implementing "new" fights, there should be a worldboss rebalancing. But even that will never happen because it is a lot of work for something that is very old content. The last rebelance was a good thing for the game and those events in particular but since than way to much time has past.
---
Hide you shimmerwings wings and the job is done.
---
I disagree.
---
In my personal experience, is better opening them first than salvaging them closed. Because by opening them there's a chance of a gold and/or exotic item inside.
---
When I try to buy gems I get an error. Anyone has any fix?
---
I do appreciate your suggestions, but sincerely, you would be albe to counter that in time ? I did not even realized i died when i registered the clip
---
Your god.
---
**I deserve this.**
---
Being top on cleave dps doesnt mean that ur build is explicitly good. 2. Boss 100CM needs high target dps to phase boss quickly. While having still bunch of adds to cleave a Sb with 45k target burst will contribute way more than 40k cleave dmg
---
I died in 0.30ish sec in the video, u say every class could do that ?
---
&gt; even on my lvl 53 bag opener
---
There are some PoF bags that contain always unids like the Palawan Phylactery
---
Vanilla champion bags should work as usual and only give unids for a lv 80 opener.
---
who was the seller? was it truly amazon, or just some shop selling *though* amazon? that is a huge and important piece of context for this topic.
---
Was about to ask the same. Listed on amazon does not mean sold by amazon.
---
Does that make all the norn &amp; human cosplay skinsuits?
---
Thank you, I indeed looked at official retailers but none of them have HoT for now (everyone writes Out Of Stock) which is kinda weird for a digital code...
---
I've checked Humble Bundle and they have it there but I do not know how trustworthy HB is.
---
don't bother the gw2 support, just return "the ware" on amazon and get your money back. its not your problem.
---
At least you got your prime points. Because they are soooo useful.
---
Oh good, been using a bunch of Cele boosters in WvW, so will need to restock.
---
Amazon sells a lot of stuff on their platform but they also allow other sellers to sell their products through the amazon website and there are also some differences: Sold and shipped by seller, Sold by seller and shipped by amazon and sold and shipped by amazon.
---
So, I would check if who sold you this was actually amazon and not someone who sold it through amazon. However, I think amazon is your best bet here because ArenaNet will not refund you anything since you didn't bought it from them. Amazon was the platform and can only be the place you get your money back.
---
And I thought jokes were obvious. But here we are.
---
spider tonic strikes again
---
The meta thief build is still strong. It's just inferior to Revenant outside of organized play. If you were running the meta SD build, you would have had Acrobatics and gained two seconds of automatic evades at 50% health. After that, the enemy would have had nothing and you'd have won that fight (assuming relatively equal skil) even with your potato quality awareness.
---
Which brings us to why you were in that situation in the first place. As a thief, you will die frequently if you aren't aware of where the other team is at all times. That's how you know when to decap and when to go all in for a kill. In the clip, not only were you unaware of where the mesmer was, you weren't even looking, so the stealth was superfluous. A Deadeye, Soulbeast, Berserker, core Guardian, Dragonhunter, Reaper, or SD Holo could have killed you just as quickly if you didnt see them coming.
---
Mirage is overtuned af the moment, but not the build in this clip. This was a clear player skill issue.
---
Within the context of a chapter that's true, but I'd imagine it stretches a bit between seasons. They're not going into new patches blind, they probably plan the scope, story, and rough content of the whole season before starting episode 1.
---
It’s boring anyway because there is no difficulty or challenge. If there was actual risk or challenge to these, I’d take downtime. But as it is, it’s largely waiting waiting waiting, shoot a few spells for 2 minutes , get minor loot.  Boring.
---
That poor bastard. His world view has been truly warped.
---
That's like saying content created for 5 person groups invalidates 10 person group content.
---
Toned down is not the same as scaled.  Scaled means keeping at least the same level of difficulty while adjustments are made to handle either fewer or increased numbers.  It is true that there are a number of scaled events in GW2 that become easier when MORE (not less) people join in.  And that's because it's not designed correctly with scaling.  
---
Again, I do NOT want toned down content.  I have no interest in that.  Simply content that scales based on how many players are doing the content.  And it really is a mistake to think that increased number of player equal harder content when it's usually the other way around.  When you can't count for max boons and standard meta compositions, you're suddenly forced to actually really think and use more skill.  You don't get to rely on others. 
---
That being said, there is also a skill in team compositions and that skill varies and changes based on 5 or 10 person content.  
---
The request here is to keep the same difficulty (otherwise, what's the point?) relative to scale.
---
The staves I use the most are : Dhuum (raid content), Envoy's Scythe (Black Lion Chest), Mark II (you can buy it), Bo (Daredevil staff collection)
---

Pretty much

thanks alot,i dont mind trying now hit yknow,there is that fomo the pessimistic redditors give me,so im not sure if ill make it to level cap

sadly no,im not poor to hungry,but i cant buy games,i have to pirate somenof my favourite gamed out of necessity

i would LOVE to buy darling but i cant afford it without losing food/debt thats why i asked

I’ll hit you guys up! 
---
If I’m mostly geared for WvW roaming on my sword weaver(not quite celestials, but definitely not max DPS) will I be able to contribute much or should I get a new set of DPS gear even if I’m dropping ascendeds for exotics?
---
I think it’s because it feels great on my Druid (thematically appropriate) but not really on any other character. It’s too specific. All the others feel more interchangeable with other professions.
---
Im currently living overseas with no laptop for a year, so i wont be able to log in until then. Havent play the last episode yet but i know the end fight (just the fight, not the story). Would it be worth it to wait for a year to find out by playing or just youtube it? Also, any news about the next expansion from the ending?
---
Make defensive stats matter. Right now a lot of PvE balance would be easier if defense stats actually mattered in PvE because lots of classes have “allocations” based on pvp concerns. If defense stats mattered, classes without innate defense would have to start mixing in some defense stats, classes with innate defense wouldn’t, so you would now be able to have a separate factor besides just pure dps to balance classes.
---
I’d make the legendary trinkets from PvE re-craftable.
---
Hopefully this was not too much of a ramble. :)
---
Hahaha. Not at all. I watched that video before and it was an incredible watch. Looks like when feedback is given and taken seriously it can bring forth amazing results.

Human? Not unless you aren't human?
---
Dungeons and Fractals are part of the core game so they are fully included with F2P. Raids however, where released with Heart of Thorns so they are expansion content.
---
Branded griffons on the PoF maps helped me learn to hate on an entirely new level. 
---
What's that? You're using a gun? Well I'M hovering 6 feet off the ground so nyeh. Fuck you.
---
introduce new stat infusions without ar and auras and add more infusion slots (stat only, no ar to avoid ) to everything
---
only pve stuff that needs changing imo is dungeons. revamp them with a new level 80 path for all of them like TA. raids are challenging enough that the open world 1spammers can't do them but the groups who perfect rotation full clear everything pretty quick. the new raid just needed more mechanics or a bigger hp pool for the bosses
---
So they took the Primeval Helmet and added more horns? Huh.

I played this game a lot in its first few months and looking to come back. After getting my account reset I'm ready but I logged in and am totally lost. 
---
I have a level 80 mesmer in gold power vit? Gear (that I maybe crafted or did dungeons for) and was using a sword and staff.
---
The game rebuilt my skills but I am so lost. 
---
What should I do/ focus on/build toward to relearn the game?  
---
I really enjoy mesmers and the illusory/time stuff they do. 
---
Thanks.
---
i would also like to give it a shot
---
Nope just the glider.
---
I bought this game around release and thought it was really cool, but I didn't like playing games with a keyboard &amp; mouse. I work on a computer all day so when I game I prefer to sit on the couch and play with a controller. A few months ago I came across videos of the Action Cam and people playing it with a Xbox One controller. I immediately signed in and downloaded it. I play as a Warrior so it's actually easy to play with a controller.
---
I have been playing it since and I love it. I bought the LW episodes and the expansions. I bought a GTX 1660 Ti to play it also. The areas / maps in this game are gorgeous. I have just been working my way through the story. I have yet to do any Fractals, PvP, or end game stuff but I am looking forward to it.
---
Oh look, a pod.
---
Only if they let thieves smash the fuck out of their rearviews
---
Then argue that opinion, rather than telling people who "didnt adapt" or plain dont agree that they shouldn't be here.
---
I can understand that players that only do super casual openworld stuff are very happy. But that doesnt address nor invalidate the concerns of pvpers, wvwers, raiders, rpers, guild leads, ... 
---
Personally I find balance in this game to be awful even in pve, where it's better than the rest of the game. Improving perhaps but still downright atrocious. Then again balance is an afterthought more than their focus so I'll assume I didn't adapt well enough.
---
do people NEED raids?
---
Adding on to this, give the champion and veteran mobs periodic immunity (only like 2 secs, not branded griffon immunity bs) and/or retaliation. 
---
The fact that so many people died to dragon arena eye of Zhaitan was just sad tbh
---
Did that happen in this particular case?, mesmer burst is several hits. From what I can tell it should proc somewhere in between.
---
It's outrageous, it's unfair! How can you be on the council and not be a master!?
---
I have experienced this years ago. When you open the client there are two update steps:
---
1. A client update. This should only happen once with every new major release. The UI is made of **only** a label of *downloaded MB / total MB**.
---
2. A game update. The UI is the one we are all familiar with, login screen, news, a progress bar at the bottom, etc.
---
If you are always downloading stuff on the **first step**, then I have bad news for you. This "phantom download" is from release and to my knowledge, it has never been fixed. It comes and goes on its own. Only thing you could try is to uninstall, delete any temp files and download the game again.
---
which is weird considering chairs are basically mounts, and you can dye those. similar thing with the skyscale chair, you can’t get your skyscale skin/color to appear there. what’s worse about that one is that the color of the skyscale ain’t even the standard color of the mount
---
Dodging in 0.30 secs is not an option
---
I would add a solo mode for dungeons.
---
tried that, tried all the diffrent IPs and none seem to work, it is still stuck and does not progress
---
Phalanx armor set!
---
I use 3 different AVs on the 3 pcs I tried and I also tried it by disabling but no chance
---
Forget Charr. Model them on a Hylek or Quaggan.
---
Yeah, could have been made a static/dynamic/synergetic chair with dyes.
---
I'd buff open world enemies. The encounters are brainless and simple, very few mobs do anything that feels like a real threat if you're built right, and generally the damage dealt by open world mobs needs toned up greatly. Open world should feel dangerous to traverse alone in. Failing a dodge should have consequence to it. Not knowing mechanics should punish you. Spamming 1 should not be as effective as it is.     
---
Nerf all Skill 1 attacks. Mobs should not get spiked down with autoattack, it should be filler between your other skills, but not your main source of damage. Hell, I'd say at least make world bosses take 95% less damage from Skill 1 skills.   
---
The game is fun, but the open world is anything but challenging or engaging with its combat. It feels great to steamroll anything we come across, but that also makes encounters trivial to even participate in.. Give enemies the ability to dismount the player, even in core tyria. Just something to make the player feel like they need to take out the mobs in their path rather than just run through or around them.
---
- general PvE

- fractals, raids, dungeons

I am sure that's it, make sure you trim down the video duration though.

Why did you do this? I CANNOT get that out of my head...
---
Also, if you get a repeated one you don't need, all you can do with them is destroy them. 
---
They could be made tradable at a vendor for something else.
---
Same for other useless or worthless minis:
---
* Account bound festival minis: Trade them at a festival vendor for a reasonable amount of one of the currencies or materials from the holiday.
---
 * For holographic minis, that could be more dragon cofffers, several jorbreakers, or a bag with lots of Zhaitaffy. And the same vendor would trade Jorbreakers for the minis you don't have.
---
* Mini Jennahs: Trade them for karma potions at the Birthday vendor.
---
* Mini Professor Mew: Trade them Handful of Fractal Relics or Fractal Encryption Keys at a fractal vendor. Of course not 1:1. I'd go with something like 1:3 for relics and 1:10 for encryptions. 
---
* Sunspears minis from Sunspear Redemption Wishes: Trade them at some PoF vendors for trade contracts.

---
Yeah, I getcha'. Buuuuut there are the moods where you're just like "Fuck it. I'm going to wear my pauldrons and a ballgown to the grocery store."
---
I can tell you first hand, I was banned for 14days for saying a bad word three times. No warning or anything first, just straight up 14days ban.  
---
It was done in a PvP enviorment. After I won the fight I followed up with a bit of shit talk, no personal stuff.  
---
So ye, theres no warning for "verbal abuse"
---
I think the scale is a large factor in what made the encounter so fun and engaging. Reducing it to a fractal would delete that sense of scale and cooperation.
---
The Marionette fight is the perfect candidate for the Guild World Event system.
---
for me CM is Crystal Maiden, what is the meaning in this context?
---
What's originality?
---
did you never break the rules before or did you just never get a warning?
---
Unless it was a really bad case of "bad language" there is something you are not telling us. 2 weeks for a first offense (if not very severe) us usually nowhere close to 2 weeks.
---
It is still solid useful. The power to go into it to do stuff and then return to your previous location is bonkers OP. You can leave your crafting alts on JPs or similar but still have access to bank and crafting an all of that. Or not need to travel into areas you just been during gameplay.
---
Armistice bastion is on same level with it, but it has few technical advantages, yet they have different secondary functions. With mistlock, you can go do fractals with any character while still having him whenever it was. With Bastion you have just WvW portals, either way you can bypass LA, but for different content. 
---
Also, Bastion is like ten times more gorgeous map. Sadly people did not took advantage of its GvG capabilities yet, as it is still paid area and not everyone has it.
---
I'd be happy if there was even just the option to trade your extras in for like some Zhaitaffy/Jorbreaker.
---
dear god why
---
give orr risen similar AI complexity to HoT mobs to ramp up the difficulty more gradually from core to HoT.
---
give mission bosses CM's to ramp up difficulty, most of those bosses especially later on in LW would be interesting as mini-raid content.
---
This may sound stupid but do you have enough space on your disk?
---
I've seen 24-72 hour bans before but this was years ago, never seen a 2-week ban for a first offense involving language. However, those who typically fall into the toxic/offensive language role typically are repeat offenders and it's possible they looked into your chat logs.  
---
  
---
Regardless, just learn from your consequences and advance on to be a better human being.
---
I have more than 100GB space on the disk I'm installing it on that should be enough, or is gw bigger than that?
---
Bounty rewards got buffed by a little bit recently (still bad gold/h). Main reason to do them is for mosaics, which are now a viable alternative to legendary crafting, so people started doing them again.
---
my [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bpcd1e/found_a_way_arround_the_timegate_not_sure_if_legal/) got locked back then :(
---
:? How is this retarded?
---
What I want is to use 2 elite specs at the same time.
---
I did use the word "fa\*\*\*t" 3 times, each time after beating a person in sPvP were he was tunnel visioning me, I got a little annoyed about it, so I baited him away from the big fights and killed him 3 times in a row, and each time I wrote that. So I did break the rules and it was not nice of me to say that to him.  
---
Next Day, 14days ban. And it says in the ticket that it was specifically because I used that word. As it is considered hate speech. I regret my action, but no, there was no warning and I have never been warned or had any suspensions before. My shit talking is usually very vague.
---
Thank you for the reply!
---
I was not a big fan of the brabaric set, but I just tried it at preview with the weapons you mention and it looks quite cool. Maybe with the right dies I can make it work for me too.
---
this is a gross gif, yours depicted IRL animal abuse
---
I reeeeally like the quiver around the hip. It is actually impossible for someone to draw arrows out of a quiver that is on the back.
---
Challenge mode. It's available for fractals 99 and 100. Same bosses, more mechanics / higher difficulty. Better rewards as well.
---
Yea, there was that concept from the beginning with overflows as well, but there are just so many things that **will** have been changed that are also unrelated to instancing, just generally how the game works.
---
Rifle is where it's at. HMS Divnity best land legendary.
---
I'm sorry, I heard *Ranger* needs a hammer... Also, one vote for tameable killer rabbits!
---
Anet explained that S5 will have an expansion's worth of content. We can safely assume that this is going to include additional specializations.
---
So there you have it then. 
---
And yes there was a warning. In the ToS that you agreed to follow when you created your account.
---
https://imgur.com/a/0T0ujMs
---
I will try to make some areas better but this is how he looks like. As I said, very similar to the one from character creation.
---
Sounds particular relevant because it's a perfect analogy. You're standing still and not paying attention when playing against a one-trick-pony build that relies on surprising and bursting unsuspecting enemies.
---
2 weeks seems appropriate for that. Strike that word from your vocab in the future, hopefully.
---
Thank you very much!
---
I was hoping it wasn't an outfit so I could use some parts of it (e.g. the shoulders).
---
Colours are very nice... Maybe i need to do some buying. I can't afford permafrost, but i suppose i can find a good replacement. :)
---
The skyscale with those colours looks great!
---
What class are you playing? How are the GS animations with it? I might be wrong, but I was under the impression that such a sword would look weird with most classes' aminations.
---
Yea it's gross, but as long as some ppl find it funny that's good enough for me xP I'll make the next one more straight up funny :'3
---
That should be more than enough space
---
*laughs in veteran awakened canid*
---
Impossible to draw arrows out of a back quiver? What?
---
People are too sensitive. Use chat filters if you don't want to see anything inappropriate.
---
&gt;But I have never in anyway received a warning for it.
---
Are you honestly that naive? Yes, you received a warning. Stop acting like a child. When you sign up for an online service, you explicitly sign a EULA/ToS. You are buying a subscription to the ArenaNet provided online service, not the right to do whatever you want.
---
Yes it's useful... but that's not the point.  The point is the Mistlock is a tiny zone and so bloated now that so many people have it. The reason I originally bought it was because I hated going to LA to even *enter* fractals. There would be sooooo many people crowded around that waypoint next to the fractal portal and I hated going there. When the Mistlock came out I could easily use the pass to get to the portal in an area where not many players were, then everyone got it and it was basically the same thing as LA except confined to an even smaller area. 
---
You don't even need the Armistice Bastion pass to skip LA to get to WvW, you can just get there from the WvW menu lol. I'm sure knew that though. I still like the Mistlock more, but have been using Armistice Bastion/older ones more than it (AB is very pretty though!). I think it could be good for GvG, but the map/arena feels too small for it... Another problem is the map could easily troll your GvG match. I think anet just needs create some kind of GvG content, kinda like how it was with GW1. The thing in the EotM doesn't count either lol &gt;&gt;
---
Tbh this is probably one of the least immersion breaking chairs. I could definetly immagine the Inquest leader to show up with that thing.
---
tried it and it does not seem to make any difference, will give it like 30 more minutes, but it does not seem to work
---
If u do show a good counterplay to that ill be happy
---
Well that's something that hasn't even come close to being on the table.
---
It’s not impossible. Just awkward
---
Also a Bard spec for Warrior that uses Staff or MH Warhorn please
---
If they brought back the BunnyThumper, I would switch mains *instantly.*
---
Even if it meant grinding out a new set of ascended armor/trinkets. Currently only have a few sets for my main/first alt Guard and Rev.
---
if you could remove the horns as well you would end up with a top Motorsport-helmet.
---
Juvenile Springers as a new pet pls anet.
---
Hey! Thanks for bringing this to our attention. Usually, these issues are API related, but this time is a little different.
---
It turns out we have hit the maximum cluster capacity for crawling API keys, due to a ton of new users. This caused the update of some keys to be delayed and not considered in the statistics anymore. We'll upgrade our servers and everything should return back to normal within a few days.
---
Halloween scythe skin
---
Solo or duo stuff would be awesome!
---
Unsheathing a sword on your back is damn near impossible unless it's super short.
---
Do you want dead ~~younglings~~ progenies ? Because that's how you get dead progenies.
---
*chuckles in veteran karka*
---
I am hoping so. I also think for future specializations they need to either change how a class uses a weapon rather than adding a new one for them to use. Or, and I fully admit this is a complete pipe dream, add nine new weapons and tie those directly to the new specializations.
---
Ele rifle powder mage when???
---
Your CPU is a 2014 Q2 release so it's quite old. You are correct in that GW2 is a poorly optimized game that heavily relies on single thread performance.   
---
The **GOOD** news is that the recent AMD Ryzen Zen 3 release [looks VERY strong in the single core performance area](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html), so even if you're a hardcore Team Blue fanatic, this will mean that Intel will be forced to further innovate and improve their own products. **I would recommend waiting for 6mo to 1yr** to see where the market goes. Either way, strong competition is good for you as the consumer. Intel either has to release better products to compete, or to heavily slash their own prices. This means you have 6mo - 1yr to save up $1k to get a good GW2 machine.
---
TBH they'd need to make some significant changes to it in order to  make it actually fun.
---
People always have glowing praise for it, and some of that is well deserved. But the critical flaw was that all five lanes would then be further divided into five small groups to each fight a miniboss. This massively shrank the room for error, to the point where it would only take a handful of players messing up to cause the whole event to fail.
---
This was already a frustrating design flaw, but more importantly, I think it caused a breakdown of GW2's core design philosophies.
---
Open-world events are supposed to be cooperative, and they've intentionally made it hard to negatively impact someone else's gameplay. You're also encouraged to explore and take part in any and all new things you come across.
---
But with Marionette, some inexperienced players joining the event are likely to actually hinder others' attempts to beat it. Not only could this lead to toxicity between failing groups and the rest of the map, but after some time it could lead to a chilling effect where inexperienced players are actively discouraged from joining in the boss fight.
---
Marionette is the Season 1 event that I'm most glad was only temporary. It allowed them to try out a massive new idea and see where it failed. And once they learned from it, they made the Vinewrath. It may be easier, but it also makes for a more fun experience overall.
---
New warrior spec: Bardbarian, Main hand warhorn, has skills that channel to provide stat buffs to players, uses voical chord strain as a resource to keep skills channeling.
---
Break bar, combo, and condi/boon interaction tutorials are absolutely necessary. The same people kept burning themselves down on the dragon arena eye of zhaitan, no matter how many times we told them to watch for retal...
---
&gt; Anet explained that S5 will have an expansion's worth of content.
---
This is not what they said. They said "Expansion like features" not that it would contain all expansion content.
---
It looks like Gonzo the muppet.
---
Thanks for advice. Hello ramen my old friend xD
---
Same, would love a new 2h weapon (personally I love greatsword but I know many are in the ugh so over GS camp lol)
---
Not work with some company because surprise mechanic!
---
My mesmer body is ready for a longbow.
---
I would force every person who tries to make suggestion type post take a test to make sure they know what the hell they are talking about first before they are allowed to post it ...
---
If we got the old Dreamer effects back I'd be down for that, hate the updated ones though :(

I'd rather have a P/P ele!
---
Drops sick beats while spinning with Axe 5
---
Where is my Greatsword Rev
---
Rev greatsword
---
nah nah, that would be overpowered since you also have to pray to god for it to work, it's like 2 specializations on one :D
---
You don't have to downvote each time you disagree you know.
---
I joined the guild for the same reason; CMs are tough to get into without a proper trainer.  Once I got rolling with a guild training group we got our LNHB titles by the second week.
---
Just dump them in the mystic toilet and get a 1g worth mini in return.
---
For learning purposes that'll do just fine, but for higher tiers you'll want to start min-maxing your equipment for its role.  
---
Unfortunately you can't run with exotics in higher tiers as you need the infusion slots to survive the Agony mechanic.  It's not as bad as it sounds!  Once I got my first character properly geared for T4 I was able to gear five other full sets for my alts.
---
I would honestly go around and start with "hey, run around the map and do a few world bosses" before I started with the expac stuff to start re-familiarizing yourself with build and newer content. If you have story left to do, that is also a good set of stuff or some of the Current Event content (you can see it in your achievement panel: Bandits, Ley Line Anomaly, etc.)
---
Is Mistlock where everyone is now or something?
---
thank god i only glanced at it. you should have just used the one of the girl playing the game where u stuff the cakes into the bear and it explodes
---
I don't see this as much of a problem. Yes it can take a lot of investment in coffers to get them from RNG ... but that is to get minis from ingame rewards that were originally from a one-time gemstore investment (that we had to pay twice if we wanted to get all minis).
---
and how are you so sure it is the retal?
---
i was explaining why his thread got locked quickly compared to yours
---
Since hammer tends to be a CC heavy weapon, I’m imagining a Mesmer spec specifically built around controlling enemy movement. Something like boxing in an area while debuffing, and necro or elemental can lay down heavy AoE damage on everyone trapped inside. Could create some cool combos in Conquest.
---
Short bow that’s held like a harp!
---
as long as I can pose as a ritualist, I'll be happy.
---
If it's a mesmer spec, I'll be double happy
---
A bow that shoots clones. Yes please.
---
Oh yeah thats a good idea too
---
Possibility? Sure. They said they were gonna test some limits with S5, could be elite specs. I wouldn't hold any expectations of it though, just let it come as a happy little surprise if it does.
---
Dervish with polearms. Make it happen.
---
Dual pistols unite!
---
To be fair, the skyscale mount should just be an animation you purchase for your own skyscale.
---
Making it a chair is dumb.
---
&gt; make the buildup phase matter a tiny bit more.
---
AB and TD used to have that ...
---
The Marionette was one of my favorite boss fights of all time .It felt challenging, yet doable. I also enjoy Dragon Stand for that same reason. I wish there were more big fights like that, that were more difficult. Not impossible, but you're not standing around afk shooting from range.
---
It's 50% off currently at the Guild Wars store! ;)
---
Dreadstrider, Dual Pistols, Cthulhu horrors as skills.
---
*ahem*
---
EA Bad.
---
Perfectly timed! I'm new(-ish) to the game with a hard earned level 80 as my main. I'm really enjoying it; focusing on map completion and leveling masteries/mounts. I just spent 9+ hrs. last weekend doing the HoT map completion train ran by /u/emikadon. It was a blast! (Got 34 MPs!). And I just ran my first dungeon (story, finished then explorable). So I was wondering just how I was going to get into Fractals!
---
At work now, but will join your Discord tonight and introduce myself.
---
Cheers.
---
My understanding is that a lot of naked human models are objects that designers can pull and use from just about any 3d modeling program. Even if they designed this human ass themselves, they probably did so just to have armor contour the body model in a more realistic fashion.
---
I would redo the drop system. Drops would be scarcer, but more relevant. Accordingly, recipes would have to be adjusted. 
---
Because is really frustrating how unrewarding this game is with drops because their RNG is too swingy (AKA 2 blues + 1 green)
---
Looks a tad suspicious...
---
\\o/
---
Have fun in fractals!! If you ever need a last person to fill, please don't be afraid to hit me up. I love running fractals with friends, and I'll almost always say yes as long as I don't have something else I need to do &lt;3
---
Happened in GW1. It killed skills like Meteor Shower and anything that would would inflict more than one hit in AoE.
---
I'd like to add that I hated it.
---
Dang. Add this to the list of Elite Specs I Didn't Know I Needed.
---
#GIVE GUARDIAN GUN
---
Awww, thanks for that, Emi! I can't believe how well that train on Saturday went! It was a bit stressful - not knowing everything and making some tactical mistakes (missing portals, falling over cliffs with my stupid Bull's Charge ability) but I learned a lot and rose to the challenge. 
---
And btw, didn't mean necessarily to name check you, but glad I did as you deserve all the credit! ;-)
---
Where is my rifle necro?
---
Something this sub hates with a passion.

Inb4 Reaper cosplay bonanza
---
!remind me September 1, 2019
---
Fo I need AMD hardware to be able to run/benefit from it?
---
Not a problem at all, and I'm glad that you did so I could offer my services :'\] I try to make my trains as noob friendly as possible, but you still have the occasional victims to the pirhannas...
---
But yep! I consider myself pretty experienced with fractals, so never be afraid to ask &lt;3
---
Mind sharing a link/quote from anet dev confirming what you said? Because it really does sound like something a person would pull out of their ass.
---
I cannot recommend it high enough, but be prepared for a totally different game. It's not a very active game, it's a form of live action strategy game. The skills you pick and the heroes/henchmen you pick are locked in ever time you leave a city, so it requires some planning beforehand. Then the enemies tend to be much more dangerous individually, and especially as small groups, so you have to think about how to fight each group. It's very rewarding though, and the story/lore are unmatched in GW2
---
I actually already enjoy(ed) doing world completion and playing WvW quite a bit, so gifts of exploration, gifts of battle, and mystic clovers are plentiful. If you're similar then simply buying mats and crafting your own is cheaper than buying from TP. According to [gw2efficiency.com](https://gw2efficiency.com) 578 gold cheaper for Twilight. If I had to go out of my way to farm gifts and craft clovers, I'd simply buy the leggy from TP.
---
Possible yes, likely no...
---
I magine the clusterfuck PvP would be if one profession got an elite spec months ahead of any other with new profession tech and no viable counter.
---
Sure, I can hear the argument then just design a counter into an existing specialization (elite or otherwise). Okay that might work but it is a serious design constraint for a company who has generally released elite specs overpowered and then attempted to rein them in (with varying levels of success, at least if the grapevine is to be believed).
---
I don't PvP but releasing elite specs piecemeal seems like a sure fire recipe for either a disaster or a very underwhelming elite specialization (or both, in the worst case, because of the whole "X got new toys before my class, so I'll kick and scream about it on the internet" effect).
---
I still want thief to get either shield or scepter.  Scepter gets a wand skin, class is called magician... or shield gets a small rondel  skin and it's a duelist.
---
I've always wanted thief to get offhand sword along with a GW1 Assassin-style spec, since who's ever heard of a rogue class that can't use dual blades.
---
This piece is beautiful, who is the artist?
---
and what do you expect reddit to do?
---
Gimme Spear on Guardian on land! Spear Shield combo incoming!
---
I didn't downvote you. I'm suggesting closing the game and restarting because it could possibly be a temporary fix- if you close down the game it should kick you out of that session allowing you to queue again.
---
I'm not saying that'll fix the bug. I'm not saying your issue isn't an annoying bug worthy of gaining anets attention.
---
But you must realize, what the fuck are Reddit users going to do about it? Go submit a report and get your support ticket, discuss it with anet. Go post on the forum in the bug section. Provide as much info as possible and possibly take a video capture as well and link it in the thread.
---
There is nothing Reddit can do for you, go about the problem logically and take the steps necessary to get your bug looked at by the actual team rather than whining and accusing people of downvoting you.
---
For me it's the expected cost in crafting that is wrong. Last item I did ended up being 2-3 times more expensive than displayed.
---
More like ,"Take a Sith."
---
I think the next exp and specializations, will be around water and underwater.  
---
Underwater mounts.   
---
Underwater cities.  
---
Underwater specs (or some traits specific to it, so it can alse be used on land)  
---
Underwater weps and armors (new skins,etc)
---
If it happens again screenshot it, video capture it if you can, submit a bug report thread on the forum, and open a support ticket maybe.
---
Sexy Santa Claus with horns?
---
Gawd damn this game needs a proper bard class.  Bards are so fun to play in games like Everquest and DDO
---
No thank you!
---
WoW is a pretty terrible example in this case since that rework completely redefined the artstyle, which is why in BfA and legion they also updated a lot of old models to fit that new direction.
---
It's a big reason why some people (like me) want to return to classic WoW, because the artstyle is completely different.
---
In GW2, even the older stuff still looks like it belongs in the same game. I'd rather they don't fuck with it too much. You've gotta keep in mind, in WoW you can purchase a race-change, in GW2 you're stuck with the race you picked. If they were to update the races and as a result turn some people off their main with absolutely no recourse, I think that'd be pretty shit.
---
Choice should matter!
---
&gt; GW2 is a game that used to preach that it was about the journey -- the "experience" of playing GW2.   
---
feels like pre HoT, were the journey was at the end for many and they never came back. guess it will take now another bunch again.
---
&gt;if OP is happy with the tattoo, and she seems to be, that's really all that matters in this case.
---
I'm sure skill in one's profession matters to both tattoo artists and customers though. Which means if their work happens to be shit, that does matter.
---
Or fail spectacularly at it.  Because killing all 3 bosses in Dragonsfall within 30secs of each is other is hard stuff, amirite?
---
Rather they get Short Bow that they hold and pluck at like a harp while daintily floating and spinning about like some Lindsey Stirling-esque trickster mage
---
Your area needs to see and know a better class of 13 year old children, then.
---
&gt; Choice should matter.
---
You lost me here.  With HoT we had a point where choice *did* matter because the grind for exp was so long.  People with the max mastery from HoT worked hard for that shit when they got it before the rework.  It was the community outrage against “grinding” that took away the meaning you seem to crave here.
---
On top of this, if you have something that is account wide, it makes more sense to let you use all of it.  If you want that restriction and choices to “matter” then we’d need to have masteries locked to characters specifically and not be able to unlock all of them ever on a single character regardless of effort put forth.
---
I’m sorry, without elaborating further on what your vision is here I’m having a hard time taking this as anything more than a rant of “the game isn’t how I *want it*” and IMO that’s fine so long as it’s still fun for the majority and remains viable.
---
GW2 players are all broke from buying gems so they can't afford those competent artists and end up going to some local parlor staffed by someone who definitely isn't working locally by choice.
---
Have some foes immune to specific conditions.
---
Have few foes with high amount of Toughness.
---
Have few foes with high amount of Health but low amount of Toughness.
---
Update Core Tyria so each level 16+ veteran/elite from every monster type have a powerful telegraphed ability to teach either dodging or breakbar depending on the monster type.
---
Who says you'll ever get a new elite? Don't count down the days, there may never be another one.
---
There will always be BiS. We have a fuck ton of gear to choose from, but when you have a healer and a tank you don't really need to worry about defending yourself.
---
It's not supposed to give this illusion of choice of what your character is. It gives you options on how to play.
---
When has GW2 ever been about that? It's a casual game, I get that's not for everyone, but it has been for the past 7 years. It's not like this snuck up on anybody.
---
How is the Kralk fight not like Teq?
---
It's better than most MMOs that just have you solo a story line until raids.
---
Go run dungeons. Socialize.
---
Not every game was made for your. Taking a break or trying something else is a valid suggestion. If you aren't having fun with a game that's cemented it's playstyles years ago... Maybe it's not for you.
---
I dunno, it's for me. A verity of entertaining options. I like raids, PvP, WvW, dungeons, fractals, open world stuff, story, etc. The community mostly likes having options. That's why we stick around, rather than go to a game that only does one thing.
---
It knows exactly what it wants to be. It wants to be a game where there are many valid ways to play it. It's not looking for an identity where it focuses only on one style of gameplay.
---
What, do you want new leveling zones or something? They make new endgame content, because most people are at endgame.
---
Opposed to other games that toss out BiS gear to people who only kinda finish content. You finished 1/3rd of that dungeon, here's the strongest sword in the game. You finished half of that raid, here's a full set of BiS armor. Yeah, you get rewarded for completing things, not starting them.
---
So quit. FFXIV wasn't for me, so I quit. ESO couldn't grab me, so I quit. I didn't stick around and complain that they aren't for me, I found something that was for me.
---
Teapot has been bitching about this game for like 7 years. Yet he still fucking plays it everyday like his life depends on it.
---
It's an old game. Even the best game ever made can get boring after years. GW2 has never been about focusing on one type of content. You aren't going to find that here. If you aren't having fun with a verity of different ways to play... You don't have to. We won't think less of you if this isn't your favorite game ever. You can find something else.
---
Final Fantasy Dancer-gone-Bard, the melancholy requiems bring enemies down rather than inspire allies and call it Dirgecaller. An opposite complementary Bard theme contra to Firebrand's inspiring folk tales.
---
If you truly have a boatload of keys and care enough, it's far better to pre-position 10 characters at all the chests to avoid the immense waypoint costs of jumping around so much. The more keys you have the more time and gold you'll save.
---
I think it is still possible that they just release one elite spec with each living world update. Just like the gen 2 legendaries.
---
Perfect, I have almost a stack of these saved up from doing Fractals every day. Thanks for the guide.
---
They took inspiration away from us because a warrior figure out how to think tor three seconds and scared people.....
---
I agree that masteries were frustrating at first, but people quickly realized that only 2-3 of them were "relevant," -- updrafts, bouncing mushroom and nuhoch wallows.  Being frustrated with the mastery system because you could not quickly attain excess luxuries was a **choice**.  The masteries in HoT kept me busy, engaged and excited about the game for almost 6 months.  
---
The main issue with horizontal progression in GW2, in the contexts of masteries, is that it **ends.**  I think that masteries need to have sort of "curve" where you unlock the standard abilities -- what we have now -- in addition to "master" tier abilities or something  like that that rewards choice, dedication and investment.   Right now progression in GW2 drops off a cliff. 
---
I strongly disagree about soul-bound masteries.  The system isn't bad, but it needs more long-term goals for those that have long-since cleared Heart of Thorns &amp; Path of Fire.  I don't think that having "post-game" masteries whether unlocked via achievements, collections or some other such framework is bad.  I think this community has a lot of completionists, but I think that they would look at long-term progression as a positive rather than a negative.  It all depends how responsibly its done.

warframe even has the same problems as gw2.  
---
- vets leaving because there is not much teamwork content and it gets boring.  
---
- powercreep through new weapons / rivens.  
---
- raids got fucked and teamwork got fucked with the relic update (a bit ago)  
---
- no tutorials for new players, often people leave because its not clear  
---
the thing is, they adress those things. they have shown squences for a tutorial. they removed raids so they can rework them completly (which one even can believe when they say that), they brought eidolons meanwhile which is great teamcontent tbh.  
---
rivens get more and more adressed wioth updates, some stuff gets nerfed to be more in line, some stuff gets buffed.  
---
big thing: melee rework 3.0, meanwhile they pushed already a little rework out and shipped it because they throught: this part is good already for the game right now.  
---
plus interesting devstreams, twitch drops, tenno con, show stuff they work on twitter, news here, news there, story development, win this, win that, player artworks ingame as pictures, player items ig with their integration etc. etc. etc.  
---
whatever they do it just goes boom boom boom, they can't even stop.  
---
what you do not like those noob traps in the ingame store? removed. shit modpacks with rng as noobtrap? removed.  
---
you can't even be mad that they are so slow with pushing out teamcontent because the whole time there is something to do.
---
Right I didn't think about this way, will add Edit.
---
I'm expecting new elite spec pretty soon to be honest, even with the living story 5.
---
They really renew the game, and a lot of time passed from the last set.
---
I'd take anything, really, got some wish, like GS thief with stances, Hammer necro and whatever could use pistols, rifle, hammer and shortbow, because they're really underused.
---
That would also be awesome
---
I rock my WoW ones from this same brand all the time. They look great... Not sure what your problem is? There is already Backpacks and stuff to buy.
---
These will look pretty great next to my WoW ones. This brand makes some pretty quality leggings.
---
I agree with many points, the thing that gets me the most is the waiting time. Say LS 5 starts out if the blue in 3 months. Maybe we get 1.5 year of ls stuff and even though they say the formula is going to change, I do not expect big changes like elite specs that give reasons to revisite old contant with new builds and strats. If there is something more after LS 5, we get that maybe in 2 years? That is 2021, does anet expect more exp players to go for another 2 year long scavaging hunt? Gimme that road map already, the information we have now does not motivate to stick around.
---
 put profanity filter to maximum :)  
---
then also you will learn slowly to stop typing those words, for your own keyboard muscle-memory
---
Guardian will have either daggers, pistols, or rifle ;p
---
[rant](https://prnt.sc/odbhrp)
---
I would take a different route: **Apothecary**. Mad scientist kind of guy, wears a plague doctor mask, throws green gas/acid bombs, and pukes on enemies, all while laughing maniacally while everything explodes randomly.
---
I got a 7 day suspension once for calling someone a cunt  for using a troll portal lol
---
isnt that what dual daggers is for? (or am i dumb and thats not possible?)
---
Every profession shouldn't have a healing-focused support class. Quickness and alacrity support is a good, unique flavor of support that fits well with Mesmers. This is on top of other support abilities, like portal and distortion.
---
&gt; anet, be more like digital extremes
---
Uhh what? Warframe has all the exact same problems that OP is complaining about.
---
The only difference is that DE drops massive content updates so quickly that the majority of the playerbase doesn't care.
---
Yes- you will need the mastery unlocked to be able to purchase mystic runestones to make the gift of exordium component
---
LOL I see me!....and the other 90% which are from the TINY Army guild xD
---
Only solution I've found for that problem is using another ISP. I know you mentioned using another network, and maybe that network was from another ISP, but trust me, try another one. The ISP that ended working for me was my phone carrier, so I had to switch to my phone hotspot whenever my download stopped at 0mb/s.
---
Now, something changed with my network and I no longer suffer from those problems, but I'm confident the issue is not the client or the server, but what's in between.
---
Why would you want a new specialization when Anet could be making more infusions to help you look even more like glowing vomit?
---
I just got 150 AR from the TP (Cheaper than i expected)  and now looking at some guides on YouTube. [Here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRDloPfJ_cI) 
---
Time to get started! apparently i will need to do a full run of Tier 4 including challenge mode for 287 days to become a fractal god. That's not too bad.
---
That would be a cool twist on things.
---
A bow mesmer would legit be the coolest thing ever. I wouldn't like a bard theme, though; I feel like that would better fit a ranger
---
Ohh ok. Well thank you very much!
---
You would enjoy it, both ways free and with expacs. It's more on pve side. It does have pvp though.
---
Zhaitan was originally 5-man, but a very large percentage of the player-base refused to finish their Personal Story until it was made solo-able.
---
If you haven't tried them, the other Arah dungeon paths and the Migraine achievement *are* social experiences that can challenge most 5-man groups.
---
What if ele rifle changed on attunement.
---
Fire tuned/ spray fire. 
---
Air tuned/ rail gun lighting snipe shot. 
---
Ice tuned/ rapid fire ice shards?
---
Earth tuned/ close range shotgun blast of stone.
---
&gt; if i end up not enjoying it then it would be a waste of time to download it
---
No risk no fun.
---
Ok awesome! I'm more into pve so this is a good thing haha. Thanks for the help :D
---
I unno. I always looked at em as a Cleric. Where you open a book of virtue and call someone a heritic.
---
I don't think that the game is going to change, Phoenix.  I think that one of the core problems with horizontal progression in GW2, at least within the contexts of the mastery system, is that it has a ceiling.  That ceiling is too easily attainable.  It's one thing for the mastery floor; for example, Updrafts, Bouncing Mushrooms &amp; Nuchoch Wallows, to be low, and another to have hit the ceiling months ago.  I don't think ArenaNet does enough to expand the mastery system.  It's a great system, but it's under-utilized. 
---
I've been playing a lot of a certain dungeon crawling aRPG lately.  This community loves to disparage vertical progression, but I've come to think that it can be done responsibly.  Vayne tends to show up sooner or later with his "Coat Rack" of greatness comment, but what does it matter? The main problem I have with GW2 is that it feels stagnant -- the game feels stale to me -- and while I have friends that I really do cherish in GW2, I could not for the life of me find the motivation to grind out "skill" in the SFTA on a training golem. 
---
I don't feel like I'm progressing my character or my skills anymore, and vertical progression having such a high ceiling? It's comforting.   It means that I'm always on the look out for upgrades or things to improve my character (or use on other characters!).  I think that when you talk about horizontal or vertical progression in a vacuum it's easy to forget that they both have advantages and disadvantages.   Improving my skill in GW2 genuinely feels shallow to me without new elite specializations.  
---
I apologize if you get mixed messages from this.  I'm not against mastery equality *entirely,* but if you look at my other comment tree with /u/Something_Memorable - the gist is that I don't think that the mastery system scales well in-terms of offering long-term goals with meaningful benefits.  I think that you should have to choose which masteries you want immediately vs. those you want later and that they should better, more dynamic choices than they are now.
---
.... I didn't down vote you.
---
What would those 2 abilities and 1 mixed abilitie be tho?
---
I feel like it would be a duelist type. Having some counter skills.
---
If you read the descriptions of the spells it has nothing to do with religion nor gods, but the struggles and triumphs of heroes and peoples. Folk heroes and folk tales. Traveling bards of old told stories of victories, struggles, and lives (folk tales) through song or spoken word. That's literally what a Firebrand's tomes are.
---
Of course. Honestly my biggest thing with WvW right now is keeping up with the crowd. I'm in sea of sorrows so a LOT of the people in my server have the mounts while a few have to run behind... It's hard keeping up.
---
As much as I liked this boss fight.  I don't think bringing it back is a good idea. It failed more times than it was succussful,  and a small group of people could easily fail it for everyone else.
---
I mean people still can't even kill 3 bosses at the same time....
---
heyyyy, didnt know you put this up, looks great!!!
---
You might need to be more specific, or link a video.  I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about.
---
After Engineer double rifles.................
---
long or difficult ?
---
[deleted]
---
You're right. I'll just give it a good ol' fuck it and download it.
---
&gt; What you want is a step backwards. 
---
Forward in this case is subjective.
---
To think that any other change aside from the way the game is currently moving would be a bad thing, is very naive. There's clearly many people unhappy with the state of the game *and* the direction it's moving in, and to ignore that is sticking your head in the sand.
---
Once again, this is just my opinion on what **i** would like to see improved, since it would be an improvement and a step forward to me.
---
Just something to provide an overarching goal while you continue to play the game.  Is there something wrong with length? It's not difficult and those that want to rush it can still rush it.
---
Every good MMO has been considered as good single player games while being predominately an MMO.
---
Max lvl is 80, you can reach on free account with two character slots.
---
This game, since the initial release, had an incredibly clear direction, and years of content patches only confirm this.  
---
GW2 was and will always be about story, open world and coop open world activities, almost 80% of content, released throughout the years, in one way or another, was wrapped around an open world and the in-game story.  
---
# Variation
---
1. You don't know what and when they're gonna do anything about elite specs.
---
2. Huge rebalance of the runes and sigils \~9 months ago.
---
3. Diviner and Plaguedoctor's stats added in PvE in LWS4, if you didn't tried to use those, staying a meta-slave, then it's not the game's fault.
---
# Masteries 
---
1. Masteries are not about specializing in something, it's just an additional progress beyond simple stat increase, while keeping the relatively easy "level up" kind of mindset. 
---
2. There is no choice in masteries and there is no illusion of choice, story literally tells you which masteries you need to unlock to progress further. 
---
3. Masteries are basically your metroidvania upgrades which allows you to progress further and unlock additional parts of the map, while being straightforward in obtaining so not to drive away or confuse all the casual players.  
---
# Difficulty 
---
1. Game doesn't favors quantity over quality, a single organized squad is way more effective at doing Dragonfall, than thrice the amount of random people scattered everywhere.
---
2. People were failing Serpent's Ire for all those 2 years [and were organizing community runs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8559b9/eu_so_you_want_to_do_some_serpents_ire_march_20th/) until it's difficulty was nerfed to the ground a month ago. See, it was not so long ago since there was a thing that mobilized community.
---
# Socialization
---
1. Socialization in GW2 isn't conflicted, you play the game by yourself or you can participate in the event with other players, game doesn't punishes you for socializing, quite the opposite, a single request for help in map chat or ask a question about some boss mechanic you don't completely understand, can drastically change the outcome of an encounter, but is it really the game's fault if a player stays quiet?   
---
2. In almost any game that doesn't have a some kind of GvG or leader elections, guilds are self-contained communitiy cliques with very little interaction with the outside game.  
---
#  Identity 
---
1. I don't understand what you mean by that, but yes, GW2 has something for every kind of player, even though the main focus is an open world and the main audience are casual players with not much time to play.
---
# Rewards
---
1. GW2 doesn't force you to farm gold, in GW2 it's up to you how to experience the game and if you decided to experience it in the most boring and straightforward way in pursuit of the biggest "reward", then it's, again, your fault. I personally was slowly enjoying my time in Dragonfall, listening to ambient dialogues, reading through Gwen/Logan/Rytlock coversation, and listening to Taimi's calls, and finding collectables, all of this, to me personally, feels like a way bigger reward, than new pants with 10 more defense and 4 more power
---
2. Skyscale
---
# Direction
---
1. GW2's direction was clear since it's initial launch and throughout the years it was confirmed by content patches. GW2's direction is an open world group content and it's story, it has something for every group of players, but the main aspect and the main focus of this game was and will always be on an in-game story and massive open world group content - events, meta events. Majority of content releases were about both of those aspects and the only thing that changed since the game release is your attitude to this kind of content.
---
So expansions are just story and more content like gear and raids?
---
MAKE MESMERS GREAT AGAIN!
---
Massive props for demonstrating the beautiful need of the semicolon! If your sentences cannot contain one, you fail! At life! And language!
---
We Tera now bois.
---
Ok, fair lol. Your other comment is just my comment, except more in-depth. 
---
That said, I still think you're being way too optimistic about DE. Warframe's Trials have pretty much gone the way of GW2's Dungeons, I think they're just in DEnial about it.
---
The biggest difference, I think, is their content production process which is a lot more attuned to the games-as-a-service model and their past as a small indie dev, whereas Anet seems to have serious problems with content production, which is responsible for a host of problems with the game, now and historically.
---
We are doomed. Why hide it.
---
How about duel daggers and and acrobatic playstyle involving lots of flips and cart wheels.
---
The Harlequin.
---
But P/P would require to either make P/x or x/P a standard build and make one of the slots Specialization specific wouldn't it? At least that's how Spec Weapons work currently.
---
D/P could work like that with a close combat playstyle but I'm never a big fan of the off-hand specs.
---
I still don't understand why they added it to begin with when the other two don't need it - Vision needs [Gift of Arid Mastery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Arid_Mastery) and Aurora requires [Gift of Draconis Mastery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Draconic_Mastery)
---
I understand that you have to farm currency for these, but they are tied to Living World anyway
---
Yeah, but I'm assuming we're never getting them, so Balthazar's huge, sweeping GS swings would fit the bill nicely.
---
But then you would silo off characters from accessing content, especially as they are all tied in with raids, fractals, Tyria masteries, legendary crafting, etc, etc.
---
Can you imagine?
---
You wanna craft a legendary. Nope. Artificer doesn’t have x,y,z mastery required. 
---
Welp. Off to level 5 million xp to craft one widget in the 5000 steps process. 
---
Repeat this scenario for everything masteries are tied into.
---
Maybe you could do what you are suggesting with new masteries, but it’ll be a shit show uproar as people are used to account everything convenience now.
---
Not sure if they'd give E a bow though since you can already conjure one. And up until now E doesn't have one of the Conjured Weapons as a normal weapon do they?
---
Is it possible to channel balthazar tho?
---
I dont think even his spirt exists, I think he's completely gone.
---
Zommoros is not amused.
---
We need more mace wielders, and we desperately need better mace skins.
---
Who has Maces? Only the Heavies I think?
---
Yeah, by blades I meant swords. GW Assassin didn't hold daggers reversed, so a couple dagger skins were actually sword skins, like Shiro. And dagger playstyle with Thief is not quite the same.
---
You can get to Lv. 80 (the max level) without the expansions, and you can start progressing through Fractals and Dungeons, which are the main 5-man instanced content.
---
However, that's not to say you have everything as a F2P player. Each expansion gives a new set of Elite Specializations, which are basically post-max-level subclasses you can train to use on your character. While core-only builds aren't bad, and there is usually a small trade-off of some sort with each subclass, equipping one of your Elite Specs in a build is almost always seen as the superior option, and they also open up new roles and strategies to classes that diversify what you can do with one character. Of course player skill and basic build competence is a far larger component of how effective the average player is in this game, a good player on a core build can wreck a newcomer in a top meta setup on any day of the week. But depending on your class and playstyle, you will be at some level of disadvantage if you're playing PvP or harder PvE content with only core game builds available.
---
&gt; To think that any other change aside from the way the game is currently moving would be a bad thing, is very naive. 
---
No, it's pointing out that if you want to progress the game towards more character only unlocks when the devs have very clearly moved the game towards account unlocking as much as possible you're moving the game backwards, not forwards. Locking things off isn't progress, it's regression under any single metric you want to try to use. There are plenty of things the devs could do that doesn't involve character only unlocks just because you want to spend more time and effort on each individual character.
---
You also can't try and pawn what you want off as, "well there are a lot of people not happy with the game so OBVIOUSLY the choice should be moving towards character only unlocks because we have to try something different." "I want more content and don't like the lack of communication on that aspect" is also not saying, "I wish the devs would start making fundamental changes to how they handle system unlocks." 
---
You can want and have an opinion on anything, that doesn't mean you should try and mix your wants into other arguments to try and push them as what the game should do.
---
Nothing about thief has screamed stealth since before HoT
---
The Antikytheria is not a place. It's a representation of the magic and the mists from Tyria's perspective.
---
sure, you still do part of end game in free, but it takes you few days longer to reach the endgame. (buy few i do mean 3-4 days, with external help, or more like 10-20 days if you'll have to figure things yourself)
---
Improving my itemlevel in other MMOs is what feels shallow to me. Oh look, this thing I couldn't overcome before I can now overcome with even less effort because I grinded out stuff that gives me better numbers. I don't feel like I have progressed at all, since I haven't actually done anything besides letting my gear carry me.
---
ArenaNet has also motioned they won't add those conjured weapons in elite specs, I forget where or I would link it. Then again ArenaNet said no mounts and that happened so you never know. One thing I do know is I want more Longbow on Classes.
---
but also there won't be new elite specs with free content because........you know....math
---
Thank you! :)
---
I feel that. I can barely recognize the person I was when I started this game.
---
It's good you did what you needed to. I've yet to find anything that makes me willing to give this up. Best of luck wherever you go! I hope you find what you need.
---
And hey, if you find yourself back here for whatever reason, hit me up. The least I can do is make sure you aren't suffering the isolation Teapot described.
---
omg a chair that moves. now make a bench that moves.................
---
Ugh..For real? Why World Bosses again? Is this what the casuals crave?
---
We're entitled to our own opinions :) 
---
I'd personally enjoy it, and i understand it's unpopular and thus unlikely to ever be implemented, which i'm okay with.
---
Damn.. I would've loved to do it with other people.
---
It wasn't even really hard solo, was it supposed to be in a group? cuz I just kited the dude around with a longbow while slowly chipping off his health..
---
Glint was a friggin dragon, she definitely didn't use a shield.
---
Doing tequatl is pretty easy to kill krait in area while waiting.
---
Also, the best way to speedrun opening chests is to not waypoint at all but have one character on each chest and open them all then repeat.
---
Most immediate and obvious failure there: assuming everyone is an altaholic.
---
If you are thinking, well fine if you only play one character then you can put everything on that one character. Great now your choice is set in stone and all other future characters become useless.
---
We'll allow re-spect! Now you just have the same thing as making them account bound but more tedious.
---
It would not make for a flat out better game. It would make a game that is better at wasting people's time. For some people that might translate to a better the equivalent of a better game. 
---
You have also created a new problem. Now you must design everything to be doable both with and without a particular mastery or sets of masteries. This means either designing two of everything or make the impact of the masteries so minimal that having and not having are basically the same. If you choose the two of everything option you now are forced to reduce the amount of content as well if you want to keep cost of development the same.
---
&gt; Having different characters with different masteries would 100% make this game better in my eyes. Having a character that's amazing at gliding and 2 mounts, whereas the other is great at the other 3 mounts. Having a character that's amazing at fractals, whereas the other is good at the legendary crafting masteries.
---
In what way is it better?
---
I need something from a Nuhoch vendor. I am standing next to a Nuhoch vendor. Oh hey I am on the wrong character. I switch to the right character. Change map. Run over to the Nuhoch vendor. Buy the item. Actually this item is needed  by the original character so lets head to a bank and put it in there. Now we load back to the original character then load into some place with a bank so we can get the item.
---
What has improved in that scenario? You could carefully design everything so the scenario never happens but for every scenario that gets eliminated you erode the point of having the segmentation in the first place.
---
Yeah you have point
---
&gt; Some people will be mad about it as always but whatever.
---
No matter what A-net does, people will always find a reason to be mad. History would prove me right.
---
This comment efficiently summarized all the numerous discussions about these trinkets.
---
I still like the floating axes a lot though
---
How about a dps buff machine like the hunting horn in Monster hunter
---
great reply. Was thinking almost the same when I read the post.
---
Shadowbringers is great
---
Mobs are better at not hitting then players in pvp lul
---
Conjure one is a shortbow. Soooo long bow may be an option.
---
Just do what I do. ESC &gt; log out &gt; double click on the character I was just on. You have to deal with a loading screen but sometimes it just feels satisfying to do for me nonetheless.
---
I don't want them to devote resources to a concept they've been trying for 4 seasons with lackluster results.
---
Wait, you mean to tell me something's broken in GW2?
---
Fuck yeah dude. I bought my consortium sickle with industry glyph for a reason you know.
---
all the "challenging" open world content that arenanet released get hated by the majority of the playerbase and get nerfed afterwards.  And even if Id love to see this kind of content, the result of having difficult content with great rewards would result in people insulting and blaming each other over and over again, which totaly destroys this awesome community and will many people quitting this content and doing the easy openworld stuff.
---
What if they made a few new/reused world bosses and had 1 of them only available to fight during each rush event? They could rotate between them over time and give these events a little more variety and exclusivity. Like seasonal world bosses that only come for summer/winter/etc world boss rush events.
---
I'm actually against the Skyscale as fury would have it.  What frustrated me the most about that was how it was broken up into so many subcollections.  I'm not expecting everything I say to go over well with the community -- everyone is so incredibly diverse in their opinions.   The crux of the matter is that I think that the mastery system is an under-utilized endgame progression system. 
---
I think that ArenaNet should consider various ways to implement some long-term term goals via their mastery system.  I don't want to say that getting into the nitty-gritty details is a waste of time, but it's ultimately speculative.  I think that cosmetic progression and skill progression are something that do hit a ceiling, and in the absence of progression systems the best thing that I can do right now is just quit.  I've always respected your comments and opinions.  I'm just spent there's no two ways around it.
---
Hmm, I do have over 300 keys, I wonder if I have the willpower to open all of them
---
If I remember correctly what Revenants summon are not spirits but echoes imprinted in the mists.
---
I would love Elite specs in LWS5 but yes, separating them would hardly ever be a good decision and I doubt anyone at Anet would consider approaching this that way.   
---
It's unfun for the players whose class gets left behind. It further strains class balance and it is just plain sloppy.   
---
They said to expect expansion level things in season 5 so I think it is possible but I am more curious about how they **could** do it.   
---
* **The easiest and most generous** *(albeit costly)* \- Treat LWS5 as a key. Having any episode unlocks the spec for all classes. Living World being free to current players however makes this sound too good but the devs could bank on other revenue streams supporting them outside of box sales. Not to mention, having elite specs in LWS5 doesn't mean we won't get any in a future expansion so this + the story/future collections may keep this game afloat long enough until the next big expansion. 
---
* **The most practical approach** *(yet naturally divisive)* \- Release LWS5 chapter by chapter as is normal but have the elite specs introduced as a "License". Some small/reasonable amount of gems to unlock "Greater teachings" and allow you to spec in any of the new 9 roles. This gives the devs a decent amount of money from one of the biggest features in this game. Many players will hate it (even though it would be cheaper than an expansion) and some with credit card issues may run into trouble buying it off the store. It could set a precedent of specs not having to be married to expansions. On the flip side, doing that could also lead to "smaller specs" being released -- ones that don't feel nearly as different and thoughtful, due to them being able to just pop it on the store as premium options. 
---
* **Something for the busy-bodies** *(Looking at your, Skyscale)* \- Do the math, factor in the economy and create a collection for the new specs tied to LWS5. Players unlock the incredibly deep collection and earn different elite specs based on their efforts in it. Each one could feel meaty enough to either force a player to invest a ton of time in game or inspire them to spend gold/resources to complete it quickly. This path would allow it to be available to everyone yet not given out freely from the beginning. A change like this could even introduce other adjustments like earnable skill collections (Crystal story spears + WvW core swaps -- something additional players can begin to attach) or something else. On a happy note: The collection and story attached may also actually make our classes feel important from a story perspective! Sometimes I sit back and wonder how does my role as a Mesmer fit in the lore? Do people just chill in bars and raise corpses or fart butterflies casually while talking about tax increases? Why is my seemingly normal street urchin able to fire lazers from his greatsword in the first place? A collection, like with Skyscale, could attempt to give a story to these abilities we've taken for granted in the last 6 years or at least introduce the new specs role/goals in a storied way. 
---
Those are my ideas for now but I'd be happy to see Anet surprise everyone and approach this in a simple way that makes everyone happy!
---
I think you underestimate what it takes to produce new elites for 9 classes.
---
Next engi weapon really should be mace.
---
Mate, as a relative newbie I am having trouble finding folks to even attempt the non solo stuff.
---
I have no good idea how dungeons / fractals or anything else works, I totally feel this whole side by side multiplayer thing you're talking about. For newer solo people, it seems tricky to get into. Maybe im on the wrong server, idk.
---
Soloed or event(ed) my way up to 80, now i'm not really sure wtf to do. I guess I should finish all the solo quest stuff then complain about the lack of grouping... but I'd like to figure out if I even like the WvW or PvP and it seems a bit, counter productive to just jump in as a complete noob level 80.
---
I have never seen Krak perhaps I am just lucky to never encounter nor heard of the constant failings.
---
What?
---
If everyone blocked them, the problem would disappear. Some people just feel forced to take the bait and reply, feeding the troll, and thus making the problem even worse.
---
You can see this daily in WvW, every server has assholes who hate each other, arguing constantly in team chat, yet they refuse to block one another and move along. Again, you have all the tools you need to make them stop.
---
Instead, we force ArenaNet to waste their time on this immature bullshit, while bots, hackers, afkers, and players whose behavior is really hurting the game don't get the attention they deserve.
---
Let that sink in.

I wish each capital city had permanent race tracks, even if they're the same as the events'.

Don't get it...  If the game forces you to pause you waste less time playing it. Or did I missed something?

So many builds have hard hitting skills on low cd so you usually dont even have to time them. Spam and hope for the best because there's nothing to lose. Defensive skills have 30+ sec cd, offensive ones have 5-10 mostly and you generally have more offensive than defensive skills in your kit.

It's not just technical debt, it's utter mismanagement and lack of direction for what the game should be and feel like.
