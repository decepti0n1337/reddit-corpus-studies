Well from an American's point of view everything was easy and quick. I have been wanting the Dragon Emblem Outfit for so long and all it took was me registering. It's definitely a step up from Kung Fu Tea which didn't work for me one bit. Anet is taking a step in the right direction, now to help our European bros.
---
---
---
I would hold off on any changes till the builds are updated for the patch from yesterday. [There are some early tests with power berserker](https://youtu.be/j3dxHjtXBBg) now and that may be the go to build, still a little early to say what the best setup is though.
---
So what you are saying is that you would GW2 to be like other MMO were you will stay level 80 and then go to a lvl 5 area kill everything just by blowing air at them and one shot world bosses (as you can in other mmo's) to make sure the low level players get a chance to even hit it. Because this makes you feel powerful?
---

---
How about you go to expansion area and start dealing with the mobs there and actaully learn how to play and use your skills. Becuase that is what you get from GW2. Skillbased. And if you don't have it or learn it your gear means shit. As it should be. What should matter is that you get better at the game and learn. Not that you gank with your gear.
---
With that logic there's no purpose to running Druid with Chrono, since it totally defeats the purpose of running Chrono in fractals. Pugs do it anyway.
---
Pugs are gonna use what pugs use, and I third the sentiment above that mediocre FB/Ren groups in my experience are smoother than Chrono/Druid groups.
---
Don't understate the value of:
---
* much higher stability output
---
* the sheer amount of CC Renegade brings to the table + that of a warrior which pugs also use - with how CC intensive fractals are, after the chrono nerfs... 
---
* much simpler alacrity output and more frequent quickness output - no reliance on wells or tides of time, and somewhat less reliant on prestacking to actually maintain boons
---
* far greater heals than that of a druid from either FB or Ren
---
Yes, running either as a healer defeats the purpose... the purpose - for the hardcore players - is the much greater DPS. For your average pug group? Nowadays I think I rather see them run FB/Ren than Chrono. Because - even casually - I think they have much better toolboxes that help carry your average group so much more than Chrono and Druid ever did. Especially now that 🦀 GoE is gone. 🦀 
---
I can't blame pugs for not running Chrono as often, now that it's not as strong alone for 5 man parties any more. It has portals, and a bunch of utility - sure. But portals - that's stuff a group with a healer probably won't be using to begin with.
---
Ah damn glad I wasnt around at the time, that sucks man
---
Aurene became a Fennec fox ...
---
ok cool
---
This game isnt WoW..
---
Heal rev is mostly the same as it was, just lacks a way to give regen now and can heal outside of Ventari if desired but that also nukes your healing potential, so... nothing much changed in reality for heal rev. You still play it the same way you did before and the orbs you get using skills from Generous Abundance are nowhere near strong enough to be worth choosing over Selfless Amplification.
---
Star Lord, man. Legendary outlaw?
---
Definitely use at your own risk, but it's worth it. Night and day.
---
Funnily enough EU is bigger than NA.
---
Its not chrono nerfs that push chrono out of fractal meta. Chrono can actually pull great dps numbers (for a support) with diviner gear. It's that druid is getting heavily nerfed patch after patch to the point that running it doesnt justify the the 10% dmg from frost spirit while a soulbeast can provide that.Spotter is also not much worth in fractals. The removal of glyph of empowerment was the nail in the coffin for me.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
U could use Chrono/fb instead but rev has slightly better synergy with fb and offers assassin's presence and kalla's summit which are big dps increases.
---
So chrono is fine, its strong support dps, permanent quickness/alacrity and fury if u go pack runes, cc is fine if you're using consumables (which you should as a support), pulls, reflects,aegis,group invisibility and portals for skips. It's just druid getting way too many nerfs to the point where other healers are simply offering way more and chrono is heavily tied with druid from the previous meta.
---
Yeah, that's why I count a 1.5g mini as lucky. XD
---
does the email you register with alienware arena have to be the same one as the one your guild wars account is on? i got a code on one of those 10min email accounts, but it keeps saying "code could not be redeemed" in game @.@
---
So one more outfit unavailable to EU. I hope we get all these back through promotions we can participate on. Has Anet actually forgot that EU is likely the biggest slice of their playerbase?
---
Not sure on heap rev, but berserker is definitely lacking in damage output considering the downsides it brings the class now.
---
I sold a confetti infusion there. I insisted on a middleman, because even if the buyer had a good reputation, multiple reddit accounts can be made and it's hard to check 
---
our middleman was Samajeste, so that was a plus in terms of trust. anyway, everything went fine and I can recommend the sub, though I'd say be as careful as feels comfortable and of something isn't too your liking, abort (though once you agree on price and method I'd say going back is no longer fair)
---
Soulcleave Summit isn't being treated as a fire field; Tooltip says its supposed to be a combo fire field and starting this patch isn't not triggering with combo finishers.

Hello! I'm a recently returning player (after a 3 yr hiatus) who has purchased Heart of Thorns;   I primarily use a Mesmer, and I would like to know what's the quickest way to unlock all the Chronomancer skills?
---
Thanks!
---
(As an aside: I have so many items from previous events that I don'know if I should keep them, sell them or throw them.. it's kinda overwhelming really)
---
Speak for yourself. As a high ping player (350ms) SB3 is a god sent. I like how both weapons are ranged so I can focus on positioning better and always have CC skills on hand. 
---
Plus, melee burst classes are popular in fractals. I much rather give them the melee space they need than competing with them during days with SA for example.
---
I think the metal rabbit looks a little bad and I am generally not too happy with how the changed rabbit tails look (like Krytan Lopp or now the badger). Something about them looks cheap, can't pin it down.  
---
But that aside, there are some lovelies in here.
---
In bootcamp/Windows, you’ll def see better performance, but you’re still running on the MacBook Air hardware which isn’t great. If you don’t mind restarting to play, this is your first stop.
---
An external gpu will definitely help you, and MacOS makes good use of it for all sorts of tasks apart from gaming/3D applications. They’re expensive tho. $500+ last I was looking. And the officially supported cards are only amd and not great performance wise. There’s a caveat, however. Currently apple doesn’t enable egpu hardware when booting into windows. It’s pretty stupid. You can work around it, *AND* nVidia cards as well. This is working ok for my 2017 Macbook Pro.
---
If you want to read up more on egpus, check out [https://egpu.io](https://egpu.io) \-that has been necessary to get my bootcamp setup to use the egpu in Windows.
---
Or that
---
Thank you very much for this response! Very insightful and helpful!
---
Make minionmaster great again!
---
The point is not about exclusivity, it is about ANet's unwillingness to implement this sort of thing.
---
We even see approximately how much work it takes to implement templates based on the implementation in arc. That was one person working on it as part of their hobby rather than there job too.
---
&gt; Dps carry pugs fractals. Heal is secondary. I'll explain why.
---
Which is why I always bring dps first. Only swapping to Druid if I see the pugs have potential and just needed some survivability. 
---
&gt; heal scourges in fractals are just bad
---
I agree. Barrier was useful in old SA, now not so much. Ideally, dps Scourge shouldn’t bring Blood Magic either for max dps. 
---
To answer OP’s question, condi Scourge is excellent for carrying in fractals with No Pain No Gain. No other classes boon rips as fast and as easily. Epidemic is also amazing for prolonged, mobby fights like Siren Reef.
---
Not remotely true. No one is imitating what bards do or what dragoons do or what ninja does, and their playstyles are radically different with their respective role competitors.
---
If anything, GW2's boon system destroying GW1's class unique system of stances and hex skills+interrupts and denials has been some of the greatest homogenization this franchise has seen, and part of the reason why classes get marginalized to begin with. Because what's the point of Blood is Power on a Necromancer  or a Power Herald giving 8-12 stacks of might when a druid or renegade or warrior can trivially stack 25 might and bring other boons as well, as can a firebrand. Essentially, the boon system in GW2 makes classes completely replaceable by the class most efficient at applying the boon that all classes have access to, and the few instances of class unique buffs like banners/spirits/alacrity+ quickness, people call nerfs to.
---
GW2 also has DPS deltas almost as large as 30%, it's utterly unacceptable how a power revenant can be doing 29k DPS at best case scenario while other power specs are doing 34k+, and same goes in deltas between condi specs like condi necro, the advertised "condition" class as said by the vanilla GW2 dev AMA prior to release being completely overshadowed by pretty much every other class.
---
Healer/tank issues in FFXIV are trivial next to GW2. The world first ultimate bahamut had a DRK in it, supposedly the worst tank by far. We've seen RDM's in world firsts and world 2nd used a black mage even prior to buffs.
---
Meanwhile in GW2 barely anyone replaces a chrono for tanking, druid and rene completely eclipse the other healer specs, and DPS has been constantly mutilated by PvP garbage QQ on condi specs to the point where only condi renegade and mirage could somewhat compete with power specs, and both those specs have gotten repeatedly nerfed while condi specs benchmark lower than the top power specs despite their innate ramp up and poor target switching.
---
Class balance in GW2 is an absolute disaster and this latest patch saying it was improving renegade healing and zerker warrior but actually ended being a nerf (just like their change to power herald in an earlier patch, a "buff" that was actually a large nerf) to said specs speaks to the poor practices Anet has surrounding class design.
---
Can we talk about that reward? It said dragon outfit so I signed up thinking some cool robe or something and ended up with a dad's Disney vacation attire...
---
Bard has literally been given a cast bar in heavensward to make it equal to MCH. They've moved away from that mindset, but early ARR and up to HW their design philosophy was largely that the same class types should cover the same ground. Point in case, there is a thread on the FFXIV reddit right now asking why all physical ranged DPS need to sacrifice DPS for support abilities. With dancer being confirmed as the next physical ranged DPS, that is just going in the same direction again.
---
Again, they HAVE moved away from this a lot in Stormblood, but their initial design for things is still there and was very strong in HW.
---
mods: IS THIS A SPOILER?!?!
---
Based on my own purchase:  
---
1. Copper Fed O Matic. Very worthwhile, especially with the loot drop they change recently.  
---
2. Permanent Access Pass (DIvinity, Lounge, etc). One click to place that have everything. My only wish is they add the option to teleport back to your original location.  
---
3. Unbreakable Gathering tools, 3 for 2400 gems. Then i got the special item that attached to the tools (faster gathering, extra items, etc).
---
That would be joining a HoT HP train. They usually do it in the weekends, starting in Verdant Brink.
---
Wiki still says thief is a deadly 1v1 when theyre not.
---
really? i have a *friend* who didnt
---
In raids? Sure.
---
In PvP/WvW? 600 range is aids.
---
The hero points in both expansions give 10 points per as apposed to the normal 1 point in central Tyria. As for items you can check the wiki ("/wiki" in game too) or just post an image here. You should deposit all materials (gear in upper right &gt; deposit all) and sell all junk items before you start sorting.
---
&gt;Why is everything berserk/viper?
---
Because somewhere into GW2 development ANET made the mistake of adding attributes to weapons/armor in a piss-poor attempt to woo the WoW demographic and fit the "mmo mold".
---
I cannot think of any other good reason why they've added attributes, since they've only been to the detriment of the game. Especially since at one point of development traits did exactly what attributes did but let you re-spec them. 
---
It's just a very, very questionable design decision in part by ArenaNet. Especially since it turns back on GW1 design where attributes functioned more like traits did in 2012 GW2, and even had "Primary attributes" that interacted with our profession mechanic similar to how GW1 primary attributes also did the same.

[Vabbi](http://builds.vabbi.org/) is a good resource for WvW zergs specifically, they have some builds and info there. Metabattle has [some guides](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guides#WvW) as well (and builds too). I have a [section that I'm working on](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#WvW_2) for WvW as well. 
---
General overview though is that zergs (large groups say 20+ lead by a commander) tend to run around taking WVW objectives (camps, towers, keeps, and possibly the one castle in eternal battlegrounds(EB)). To take a structure you need to kill the NPC guard protecting it then stand in the capture point till it fills. Right after you take an objective the NPC is [invulnerable](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Righteous_Indignation) for 5 minutes. In order to take towers or keeps you'll need to break down the wall or door. This is done with siege (mainly catapults for walls or rams for doors but also long range trebuchets). Commanders will place down build sites and need people to spend supply to build them. By default you can carry 10 supply (5 more if the guild claiming it has the upgrade) and you just need to interact with the build site to use your supply. When starting out let others use the equipment since they will have skills for it. 
---
If you are roaming you are mainly trying to flip camps, kill dolyaks, and assassinate lone players. Thieves and rangers have good options for roaming and can be very mobile to get away if they need. Check out the [smallscale builds](https://metabattle.com/wiki/WvW) lower on this page for some ideas but usually you want a build that has burst damage, mobility, and survivability. The meta builds tend to take maurader gear for more survivability. You can mix and match a lot of gear sets to get what you want but the idea is that you don't get killed instantly vs another player.
---
Try to find out what your server (or paired server) has for voice options and if they have a list of builds they like. I have a lot more fun running with a knowledgeable commander in voice rather than roaming on my own or following an aimless group. Let me know what you still have questions on after reading all that.
---
FML that apostrophe in the title is killing me, how to edit
---
Honestly I did look (check out the in game wardrobe at a bank or [on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gallery_of_back_items)) but none of them really stood out to me. There were some that I liked but that was just personal preference and not because they matched or anything. If I had to pick I think I would go for something like [one of the books](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Koss_on_Koss_\(skin\)) or maybe one of the smaller quivers. I think [burden](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Burden) and [the scroll](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/White_Mantle_Scroll_\(skin\)) are a little too much, maybe something basic like the [starter scribe back](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Simple_Scribe%27s_Backpack_\(skin\)) could work?. Really though I think it depends on race, profession, and what you're going for besides just ritualist.
---
I'm sure they are, it's not like they did this exact same thing, for the same outfit, with Kung Fu Tea and it was a massive failure.
---
Likewise. Most irritating.
---
i really want this too; the common counter to it is that people dont want to have to set up keybinds for each individual character (as vanilla ESO has it)... but if properly implemented theres way around that (ESO mods let you set one character as a keybind template and have it automatically apply to all others)
---
I believe they're run out so bit too late now.
---
Can you explain what you mean by that? I'm still pretty new. How are the branded and immortal different from other weapon MTX?
---
Nah, "Don't get your hopes up" in giant flashing letters.
---
You have maple syrup and poutine, ya spoiled brat!   ( /s )

what? are you implying people doing the benchmarks are bad?
---
at least you'll got it at a later date, meanwhile south americans,Asians, Africans, Oceanic players cannot complain at all... I guess every non-USA/european player are just second rate people for anet... or that's the message they have been giving so far, just the roller beetle event to quote an example of this BS.
---
I reported him and I encouraged others in mapchat to report him/her for spamming (coz they were hopping from map to map advertising it and guild leaders are getting banned for doing the same thing) and also for scamming coz you're not supposed to trade outside of the trading post, but I got a lot of arguments from others about how its not "illegal just unsupported" because the grey market exists, and I made the argument that anet actually doesn't moderate the grey market and just because it exists doesn't mean they support outside of the trading post transactions in mapchat. But it was a lost cause with some of them.  I mean, even despite all the downvotes this is getting the 1 upvote I did get literally doubled my karma so eat that.
---
Well that's kinda dumb...
---
As if they do it intentionally just to spite half their player base. Do a little research about international sweepstakes and give away regulations.
---
Actually, Necromancers were polar opposites to Ritualists in GW1.
---
Necromancers revolved around the manipulation of death and corpses.
---
Ritualist is about the cleansing of spirit, the separation of body and soul, the communication with the mists.
---
It's actually part of the official lore that Cantha *doesn't* have an undead problem because of the ritualists. (Ironically enough, the Afflicted are nothing more than Shiro's presence twisting spirits, which is the consequence when a Rtualist isn't around to cleanse the dead. It's also why Master Togo, a ritualist, serves as the foil to Shiro Tagachi.)
---
I want this too. I use dodge with V, but with my mirage (you need spam dodge all time) i use Q. And with other character is the same, i dont use the same keys using holo or chrono than revenant or tempest

same could be said for

- Druid Spirits

- Herald Utilities

ANET says they want to get rid of Fire &amp; Forget skills; but keep simplifying their Fire &amp; Forget Skills. (banners losing their pick-up &amp; skills, Spirits teleporting to the player on flip-over)

It’s such a drastic change just it looks a lot faster.

Hi all! So I've been away since beating Path of Fire and was wondering if anyone could give me a briefing on any new things I should look up/be aware of. :)
---
So far, all I know is that there's 1(?) new mount that I can acquire through the living story.  Should I know anything else major? Are there any new specializations or anything like that?  Any new mechanics I should look up? I mainly just play PvE btw, unless something big happened and WvW is now better, I'd be interested in that. Lol.
---
First of all, this is not a garbage thing to do and heres why:
---
1. Without people like him, EU players wouldnt have a chance to get the item since VPN isnt mentioned anywhere and it requires tech savy people to figure it out and to do it on their own. Its literally a +/+ situation.
---
2. He values his own time in his own way. You can do it for free for each european player..if you wish to spend 24/7 making new accounts or you're a priviledged american player who plays on EU server which is even easier, ( as most people are who tried to come at him on map chat) you're free to do so. As is anyone to do it for less. Like who are you to try to tell someone how and if they should price it. All I see is people bashing him but why arent you being charitable and doing it for them? Hypocritical.
---
3. If you reported him for Scamming, thats a false report so hope it doesnt backfire. Thats not scamming. As far as spamming goes, if he changed map to introduce his offer to a set of new people, they are not being spammed, spamming is considered if he would spam it a map over and over with no intervals. Also usage of certain chats isnt defined anywhere. It doesnt say anywhere that you must use x chat for x thing..other than talking.

Well not really, it is based on WvW (less matchup servers), sPvP (dead scene on NA compared to EU), GW2efficiency says that their users are 56% EU and 44% NA. That most Oceanic players do play on NA and not on EU is known fact. mexicans might be different as they might want to play on Baruch Bay (spanish-language server, EU), but otherwise we can be very close to find 2/3 of players non-US.

I honestly feel like the zones in Season 4 should have been switched around in terms of when they should have been released. 
---
Episode 1 should have taken place in Jahai Bluffs, where we first unlock Sun's Refuge after we fight Koss within it, and he turns the other cheek, and allows us to use it as a hide out while we proceed to travel around the zones in Southern Elona as we did. Maybe Episode 3 could have take place in Istan, where Joko held himself within Fahranur; and we deal with the aftermath of Joko's defeat and Kralk's Mist warping invasions in Episode 4 in Kourna (Tarir-style Branded defense event in Gandara, anyone?). All the while, we unlock new section of Sun's Refuge and new NPCs/Merchants along with each episode. It would have been so perfect!

yeah this speaks alot to the idea that they keep trying new things instead of doubling down on how to make what they have perfect. HoT and PoF feel more like the latter, living world seasons, especially season 1, feel like the former

**Remove headbutt's stun while in berserk mode (pve only).**

That would probably get the rotation up a decent amount. It would only be used outside berserk at the beginning and then it would be used off cooldown while in berserk from then on basically.

Tekkit recently put out a world completion pack on gw2taco, so it's something to check out if you need visual assistance and finding general direction.  You can check it out on "tekkit's workshop" on YouTube.  I do recommend finishing hearts as you go that way you don't have to backtrack.
---
For general advice on map completion, you need to pay close attention to your mini map and proceed through the fog of war collecting every objective before moving to the next part.  The reason behind this is that all the objectives in the fog of war will be blocked from highlighting while the ones that are not in the fog of war will highlight.  This will help set up a natural path system that you will follow encouraging a smooth exploration feel.

Of course it isn't. I never said it was. You're still massively discounting the work that would go in to it. 
---
&gt; The content is already there, only locked behind a skill-wall.
---
Group content cannot just be turned into single player content without nerfing every single mechanic to the point that they do nothing or removing the mechanics entirely (eg think greens on vg if you're familiar with that), and if you do that you do not end up with a satisfying product. They wouldn't just need rebalancing, they would need redesign.
---
&gt; If they built it in such a way that they cannot easily modify the existing work, then they are merely repeating the mistakes of the past

and we all know there's no way they did that!!!!

that said; some classes (mainly guard/reaper/renegade) have ways of getting particularily high crit chance bonuses that allow more leniancy into valkyrie gear (POWER/vit/fer)... they have big downsides though (requires perma ret uptime/requires 25 vuln stacks/requires full endurance) that can (and do) hamper them in open world
---
marauder (POWER/PRECISION/vit/fer) is probably your next best bet; and can be particularily beneficial on reaper (because vit also scales LF, and LF generation is % based) but still comes with notable damage loss (also depending on build; severe risk of overcapping crit)
---
Is it really us only?  I would love to get one as well when I register ... but why  us only ...
---
Fun thing, i started playing the game buying a Dell Alienware from their site, but i'm european.
---
So they can be avaiable for EU..
---
Disable adblocking software and register again? It appears right after you complete registration. Hell, just have your roommate register a second time and it will probably work.
---
i logged in just because i was already registered, they don't even have code left for eggs, so don't bother even for that.
---
I played as hybrid renegade before patch in t4 fracs and cms. After patch got harrier gear for switch if party need heals. Really strong heals, condi clear, 100% alacrity and might uptime, vigor from orbs.
---
The problem i found that in full harrier gear and fractal potion your boon duration is over 100%, so you don't need that much concentration, but don't know hot to setup gear yet.
---
I have mine fully upgraded and still forgot about it haha
---
hey there bubble boy
---
I've seen somewhere that the bundle was 25 one time, but I could be mistaken (is it correct in english?).
---
Anyway as soon as the other exp drop below 15 I will think about it. For now I've still to finish the story, farm gold for buy all the seasons and gear up, so i've plenty of time :D 
---
Thanks for the advices by the way.
---
Same! I only just remember having that problem myself, but I haven't had it for a long time. That's because I bought the exo mounts a while back!
---
Hmmm =( .. Hmmmm ! I want back the Dragon Bash .. I want back the farming for mobs and ragon Cofins. It was my first festival I was farming for. Even got my first Black Lion Skin from it. My lovely Jade Hammer &lt;3
---
And this is why I don't believe that the ending to episode 4 wasn't inspired by Infinity War.
---
Each expansion is on the GW2 store for $30 as the base price. When you buy PoF and bundle HoT with it HoT gets a reduced price of only $20 so the pack of both is $50 instead of $60. PoF fairly often goes on 50% off sales and applying a PoF discount to the bundle works for the full package meaning that instead of $50 it is $25 for both. Many of the 50% off sales only work on PoF or the Bundle and not HoT alone.
---
I want effects to be processed by my graphics card but somehow they're all CPU bound
---
The only people that got banned were those that abused the system. Players that used a VPN to get **ONE** code were fine.
---
pretty sure that's not intentional
---
When we Brexit our country will still be in Europe. We are not moving our little island access the sea lol. We are just seperating our laws, rules and regulations
---
As someone who got more or less completely burned out of GW2 for now and has moved on to FFXIV I am curious, could you explain what you meant by issues with the design of the healers? As a SCH I feel like my gameplay is quite different from what, for example, a WHM would be doing. Or do you mean that the current categories of healers means they would have trouble adding a new one?
---
nice try

---
Here come the people missing the point by telling you that every skin is farmable in game if you just farm enough gold.
---
It's because USA is one country (and company is based there) and Europe i whole bunch of countries with different laws. That makes logistics harder. 
---
Too bad for us europeans :P
---
Sounds like a WoW fanboy is salty 'cause GW2 is not WoW

Child filters which still have to be put in place by parents, under their responsibility, which they don't.
---
If it weren’t buggy it might even be really strong for sword dagger build. Trickery acrobatics and daredevil might be even stronger than regular s/d. Even more annoying to fight but stronger. Shame that staff and d/p build had to die for it though.
---
When I saw they give away that outfit I instantly registered only to find out later (because it didn't say it in the e-mail...) that this only applies to the US. I still can't believe how ANet never thinks about the consequences of their actions...
---
At first I was "Oh hey, a refuge that you can upgrade and have positive visual impact on, there's even a music player, neat"
---
But then I played through the "All or Nothing" episode and now I can't bear to even look at Sun's Refuge and especially at *her* nest.
---
Hope all those Ppl who sell codes Ingame and on Ebay get banned and get hurt horrible in real life... Thanks for taking away keys for others.
---
Being a bannerslave is boring enough don't make it worse for us please. Hotfix asap
---
No, it really isn't an outlier. While this is somewhat less of an issue before, it very much *is* an issue. Renegade on Dhuum? Mirage on Cairn, Matthias, Desmina? DH on VG, thief on Qadim etc. Homogenizing classes and making almost everyone play DPS is stupid and bad balancing.
---
You just admitted you spit.......so do you forcefully expel it out or just let it dribble down your chin?
---
You're giving the low IQ dribble vibe atm it seems.
---
You do you though
---
Apology accepted.
---
bs currently runs only a single assassins piece, it fixes crit chance via rune of the thief instead. it also doesnt run signet.
---
The blunt answer is no, the gamer base simply isn’t even big enough to test out every single stat set, its also partly fault of the hotizontal progression system. Its too expensive and useless to either keep restating gear or aquireing enough to have apl the sets. WP, a player as end game as possible doesn’t even have (maybe by now he does) all the gear sets and he has stated its one of his goals, so yeah. If there was vertical progression like in runescape for eg. things would be a lot easier (and personally for me more rewarding and interesting but thats a statement dead in the water with this player base). Secondly, what do you? All thats gonna happen is that you dont do as much dps but in open world why would you care anyway if you can skip most mobs with mounts or you’re doing metas why care since you get the same participation regardless. If you want tanker gear, go marauder, for condi i dont remember which one was the gear set. HOWEVER you should just ‘git gut’. It might sound assholeish but honestly its the best answer, it really is.
---
seems so, fun thing is? People on real money sites are selling them by the handfulls for cash so Arnet really helped them out.
---
better check your antennas
---
You can check about wooden plank and metal rod too, for CC bundles.
---
Why is this garbage allowed here...isn't there a sub rule for creating drama.
---
It’s impossible for Anet to tell if you’re an American resident, so no
---
Why not into a potato ?
---
GW was always about humans. The Lore about the Bloodstones being Seer invention and such is knowledge discovered between games. In original GW it was believed human gods made it. They even brought humans to Tyria through the Mists, so they're basically an invading species.
---
Yeah wvw is not at its peak for us who play during Asian normal gaming times. I’m on blackgate and still trying to find a time to capture a keep for the warclaw.

Excuse me for a moment while I cringe painfully. You sure found the best character in the best show to attribute this Arthur Clarke's misquote to.
---
Where are the best places to farm mat for Gift of Might and Gift of Magic? I wanted to buy them initially but it's pretty expensive and I could use the gold for another ascended set. Thanks!
---
Server only matters in WvW. PvE and sPvP has mega servers where you're put on the same server instance regardless of which server you joined.
---
For WvW Sea of sorrows has good OCX guilds and population. 
---
If you have never changed servers before, the first transfer is free, the next ones will cost 500 gems.
---
Keep you can do at the edge of the Mist, however, the capture a camp you need to do in WvW. I find that a regular level 80 + you can help take a camp. I just shouted one night and I got a rando to help me 2man a camp. I just need that reward track.. which is taking a while
---
Using on my Warrior Mauroder Set.. but it's just for open world pve and WvW ... Don't care if I do 2k less damage.
---
Yea so atleast if i want to play some WvW i'll have a higher chance of grouping up with people. I don't think i've transferred yet as i have owned the game since release. Hopefully it's still free and i can join Sea of Sorrows as it looks like it's full.  
---
btw, i'm the remnant member of my guild. Does my guild transfer too or should i look them coffers before I do
---
Short answer: no.
---
Long answer: no, because boosting up usually doesn't change the fact players don't know what to do and are lost in the game. Moreover, they don't have the stuff nor character knowledge to dive into expansion content, and get destroyed (HoT is pretty brutal).
---
I won't tell you that boosting is absolutely never the correct choice, each one is unique. But it's very risky for your vision and future in this game. If you really want to do it, I'd advise not to use a mesmer, which is one of the most complicated to master, and for which the potentiel is multiplied by traits all together (so very late). A more easy class would be elementalist/necromancer/ranger/warrior.
---
Considering it's a color change with added details on the original cultural medium I would be salty if it was a gem store item and I believe should be available in-game. I don't share your view of this being amazing design that deserves a raise and thus don't think it's worth the money.
---
Oh right, I still haven't finished Istan...
---
Started playing after that was over, so I only bought it relatively late for the farming spot and never finished the story.
---
no and you can die.
---
I was really glad to see the ritu outfit here, but they messed up the skirt. As you might have seen they removed the sides from it. I think that reduces clipping while sitting on a mount.
---
You can just try it, the lvl 80 booster is reversible. The  boost puts you in silverwaste @ lvl 80 with and lvl 80 exotic soldiers gear.  You can then hang out there for a bit and reverse it (by talking to an npc) if you don't like it/are overwhelmed. Or you confirm it and are now lvl 80.
---
Taxes and identity control will have repercussions on customers, I guess. It will be more expensive, and I'll have to provide papers.
---
\~19€ for 2000 Gems, possible lower, depends on local offer, with "physical" Gem Cards
---
I can hide squad members names. I do have show all thick healthbars on, though, so I'm not sure if it will solve your problem or be a reasonable alternative.
---
You think so, even at the minumum gem value? In the first iteration I excluded them completely, but that felt worng to me.
---
Yep I can do this later today!
---
It should've come with HoT tbh, the elite specs just have such vastly different mechanics that different keybindings would really help. Also build templates of course, but they are coming soon™, still (nearly?) 7 years too late, but hey, progress.
---
Wait what, they ran out of them? for real?
---
Yes pls! I had to come up with a weird ass setup that almost works with all my chars but not rly.   
---
As for "I don't want to setup keybindings for each character" isn't a good enough reason imo. It's not like there's 50 buttons you have to rebind and I don't think people this lazy should be treated as a standard. (But us having to change keybinds on CHARACTER SWAP isn't a big deal ofc).  
---
Not to mention WoW has addons for years where you copy profiles to characters and can decide to tamper with the original template or make some character specific binds. (And the game itself has character specific).  
---
It's doable, but everybody knows gw2 code is spaghetti and from what some people gathered it is a way bigger mess than everybody thinks. They need way more time and work for the simplest of things because of their code and/or engine. At this point I'm sooner hoping they remember to add all these QoL in the next instalment -.-
---
I just hope the restructure helps to stabilize the player base while the addition of things like warclaw or double week serve to bring more people (yes casuals) into the game mode.
---
In old gw1 we had “double” weeks that rotated by game modes... that really really encouraged players to come back out to play those double weeks (they were once every 8-9wks if I remember so it wasn’t often enough to ruin the titles/rewards BUT it really got influx of players AND vets to return for double weeks so you could catch up with old friends, play matches, and be nostalgic over lost builds and bitch about nerfs and such lol)
---
Sort of like gw2 could do... we just need a rotating schedule of “double wvw points week” and “double PvP points week” and even double... fractals? Or raids week?(I’m sorry I only play wvw/PvP)... but give them some double weeks too and it’s all win and really does add people to the game modes. (And some stick around to finish a title or get a reward they are close to so it’s win for full timers as well)
---
I think you simply need to learn to plan and think before just randomly using Berserk, which is probably the whole point of the current system.
---
Druid is a healer/support spec, you won't be able to make a DPS spec out of it that's good enough to compete with base and especially SB.
---
Pretty certain Alienware won't mind serving me in the UK if I got my wallet out and bought from their site :p
---
Most people tend to advise against it, but I recall a post from someone who had the same trouble as you are... decided to ignore all the advice and boost anyway. The result was that he loved it and it changed the game for him.
---
Honestly, it's a 'your mileage may vary' situation. As another fellow here said, you can try it out -- it lets you trial out the level 80 character and reverse if you don't like it.
---
What do you mean plan and think? I play warr to smash, not to think.
---
Yeah, and then you will have "issues" like this.
---
Captain Marvel isn't either.
---
Brie Larson might be, idk much about her tho.
---
Sylvari armor is connected to their bodies. You cant just slap the skin on other races and call it a day

Beserk mode being a heavy armor "other form" like medium armor, holosmith's forge or light armor, necromancer shrouds. 
---
Interesting.
---
Most of the damage comes from Berserk (due to modifier) and the build is built around it, i'm just asking for the possiblity to press the button again to cancel Berserk so it's easier to manage and plan your next Berserk aka your DPS.
---
They are out of outfit codes already...

---
You'd have to do the same things you currently have to do to access online gambling. Very little.
---
Again, it should be treated EXACTLY THE SAME AS OTHER GAMBLING. Which is widely available and requires minimal effort to access.
---
This scaremongering is nothing more than scaremongering. You don't have to jump through paperwork to get online and play on a gambling site, you won't have to to play games with lootboxes.
---
i think its trash,bcs its gimick and its all based around adding time to your bers time,which have already bad dps and ofc,bcs you are warrior you get penalty for doing half dps as dps classes,so you get random -300 toughness,removed burst skills if you are not in bers mode....... yee its preaty much dead on arrival. i wonder which button they gona remove next on class,with least skills to use =)
---
Am currently in a SG based guild that does WvW regularly. 
---
PM me if you’re interested :)
---
I duno. People on teatime are always banging on about there's more EU than US. I'd love to know for sure.
---
It is normal.
---
It is not about the graphics alone.
---
Think about rendering what you see on screen.
---
When you are alone, your client sends data about your movement and which skills you press to the server. Server confirms them and sends you back an acknowledgement and that indeed did happen.
---
It is called authoritative server and this prevents cheating and data injection by the client. 
---
Now.
---
Imagine the client/server communication clusterfuck when you see 50 players on screen.
---
The server must show you what any of those is doing, in milliseconds. If you want 30 FPS, the server must do that 30 times per second.
---
Sometimes you will not receive confirmations from the server fast enough as it cannot cope. Then you will see huge performance issues and FPS drops.
---
This issue is present in most modern games today. The more data you have to communicate, the worse FPS drops you will see.
---
LUL
---
Also
---
&gt; Register to Alienware Arena today to get codes for in-game items, including ~~Dragon Emblem Outfits~~ **(US only)**; ~~$25 in Dell Rewards, which are useable just like cash on Dell.com~~ **(US only)**; and Toy Miniature Eggs (all regions).
---
Hooray, getting spam from a random company for a Mini Toy Egg! \o/ (no thanks)
---
New players lul. We dont have enough comms and groups willing to deal with new players, and without those most new players quit. Meanwhile roaming went downhill with warclaw altho havoc groups are fine.
---
Getting new players is easy but most of these casual new players dont add much nor stay long. Personally most arent worth fighting with or against and will never reach that state as improving even casually isn't in their interest. 
---
Anet only updates to the gamemode has been luring in more casuals and pve players, while the vets and guilds continue to quit. This makes the gamemode less fun even for casuals and in turn leads to less activity and players, even the casuals and pve players.
---
You cannot make wvw a casual mode as long as almost all casuals want to be able to jump in and have groups or commanders to follow. These groups, especially if you expect high availability, arent casuals or pve players, and are what is really lacking in wvw. It wont grow by luring in more pugs who quit as soon as you interrupt their ktrain.
---
https://youtu.be/_eTwqhZag0g
---
I like your fashion thinking. Sylvari are awesome btw.
---
Depending on how long it's been you may want to just consider yourself a new player at this point. I'd suggest leveling a character and getting back into the story and how things work. Once you get to 80 you can start looking at something like [fractals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bt-vFeeLAeEsaoz72bkc4ZODsudIQ2hiQdvSnFYLtw/edit) and [how to gear your character](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character).
---
*cries in holosmith* 
---
sure, when they do it to us first, we literally explode ourselves to death if we are too lenient and/or don't have the traits to help mitigate the risk.
---
fair point
---
"iz just gaem y u haf to be mad"
---
You right if game code uses network sync every frame and moreover waits for network sync.
---
MMO titles never use this just because of authoritative server and big amounts of objects that are on screen.
---
Instead server have internal update rate and send rate that is not depend on client FPS. 
---
Client recives that data and interpolates over drawed frames using past time synchronisation.
---
You never see fps drop to 0 if you experience disconnect proves that. 
---
If you see any lag it will make objects move to last previous recived point A and then when lag ended, objects will be moved to last recived point B and then to newly recived point C when next point D(after newly recived C) recived.
---
ofc more objects more cpu power eaten, but that not depends on network lag.
---
One of problems with gw2 performance is amount of time it uses to perform a single draw call and how it treats dx9 resources.
---
It is \~9us/draw (on i7-7700). To keep up 60 FPS scene should contain less then 1850 draw calls.
---
Adding fact that it can go over 8000 draw calls and some resource allocation/deallocation lag-spikes, that can draw fps to single digit, you probably never note network induced fps drops.
---
Can help with the inventory if you want to link an image but mainly you'll want to deposit materials (gear icon in upper right of inventory) and look up what you're not sure of on the wiki (or /wiki in game).
---
Foresight and planning will help in some but not all cases. If you need to unload your damage in two separate bursts, spaced 20 seconds apart, then you need to invest your utility slots in rage skills and use them to extend your berserk else you are simple out of luck.
---
If you imagine a case in WvW where 2 groups push you 20 seconds apart, there's other utilities you'd really prefer to be running so you end up having to pick one of the two initial pushes to have berserk on, regardless of how well you plan. If you could cancel the berserk stance after 10 seconds you could have it available for the initial push against both groups.
---
Now, that this limitation exists is not necessarily a bad thing design-wise, provided the berserk itself is sufficiently rewarding to make up for this and the other drawbacks of the spec.
---
You're not American, you're Canadian, the fuck you want?
---
In the queen's wardrobe...

Fashion Wars : Endgame
---
The thing you oversee is that its near impossible to kill enemys that are 15+ levels above you. On the otherhand if you would 1shot mobs in the starting zone everything would be super ez and there would be no fun in going back there after you experienced your 5min of accomplishment. If you want accomplishment learn a class look up rotations and go in the lions arch aerodrome and look for a trainings raid and try to kill that boss. When you finally kill that boss you will get ur feeling of accomplishment and you will still be able to have fun in the first zones against for example the world bosses.
---
Tbh, i dont really care much about it and im from europe, im just glad this time its way better than this shitty bubble tea promotion, that was a complete mess.
---
If it's your first toon, no, don't use it. If not...fire it up
---
That doesn’t make sense — Logan would have cut and run way before the point of no return.
---
Another information:
---
&gt; watching the cut-scenes and stuff like that, which we usually can't when running in group because the other players would either skip it or just run ahead of me
---
Mini dungeons don't use cutscenes at all. Cutscenes only appear in instanced/story content. These mini dungeons usually either have an NPC that will stall everyone because he needs to open a door a set a brazier on fire (like in the Forsaken Halls), or no NPC at all and you're just going through the puzzles and small encounters.
---
As other said, you should be able to complete it solo (just like the other mini dungeons and jumping puzzles hidden in Tyria). So if you ever see a swarm of mobs that you can't deal with, and keep on respawning, it usually actually is a "puzzle", where you don't need to fight them but either avoid them or make them flee. Look around, see if you can interact with things to help you. And if there's a NPC guiding you, listen to him.
---
Good luck on your exploration!
---
Mini-dungeons are easy but you didn't do this one properly I think.
---
You're not supposed to fight an endless army of graveling to escort the NPC. You're supposed to use the torches to light the ground and make them flee so that you can both walk safely through the room.
---
*spin spin spinnnnnn*
---
Ok then don't use the bandage skill and you will die in 10 seconds.
---
You dont ever go outside of europe and believe everything your government tells you
---
The steal for daredevil had its ranged halved to 600. The boosts to sustain have been classified as minor and that's being generous.
---
D/P daredevil has been removed from PvP. All you have left is core s/d which isn't that strong in the grand scheme of things.
---
Its the constant DC's after every Jackle portal that irritates me honestly
---
i figured getting lied to after wasting a day or two of my time trying to get that piece of malware working i was entitled to a simple outfit
---
No it wont work. To properly spike you need to blow a utility to properly +1.
---
they dont even fix expansion maps why would they fix core ones
---
If I might add to that, for a lot of long time players, they do. As with the above discussion regarding BRD/MCH/DNC being shoehorned all into supportey roles, a lot of people feel the same for healers, once you remove a lot of the fluff. You have your basic low level heal (Cure, physick, bebefic), your second stronger heal (Cure II, Benefic II, Adloquium), your 300 potency AoE (Medica, Helios, Emergency Succor), your 'identity' AoE (Medica II, Aspected Helios, Succor), your instant AoE heal (Assize, Indomitability, Stellar explosion (a bit odd one there)), your class gimmick heal (Regen, aspected Benefic, Embrace (which is actually stronger than regen)), your 'bubble' (Sacred Soil, Asylum, Collective unconscious), your generic DPS spam ability (Stone, Malefic, Broil), your 200 potency AoE dps spell (Holy, Gravity, Miasma II), your obligatory dot, and a bunch of healing enhancing and mp spells, which are mostly shared in the role skills. Scholar is THE healer with the most unique identity, but they all share a very distinct design pattern that is very egregious when you switch from WHM to AST, due to the two being too close to each other for many people's comfort. So for people who played the same healer classes for six years, it feels a lot like you are always pressing the same six buttons, just with mildly different timing.
---
This led to a curious situation in SB where they introduced excogitation to SCH, which triggers a heal when the tank gets to a certain percentage, which felt like a more WHM suited ability, because back then it would not trigger if it timed out and could thus potentially punish you if you decided to shield your tank, which is SCH's identity. Conversely WHM got a barrier spell which drained their resource for a quick instant barrier on, which a lot felt more like a SCH spell more than anything.
---
Healer design is tricky.
---
It isn't really a misquote as Arthur C Clarke's original quote is explicitly mentioned during the episode with this statement being an update to the Clarke's Third Law within the lore of the show.
---
https://screenrant.com/star-trek-discovery-season-2-episode-2-questions/
---
Does it make you thonk? Hmmm
---
Is it purely wvw or pve as well
---
I'm pretty casual player
---
Have been messing around with some Holo condition builds, but its too much effort compared to all other classes. The Holo is the least forgiving, most rewarding class and we get flak / nerfed because the fundamentals of the class require you to be damn near perfect. Playing Holo has made a tangible difference to my ability to play guitar!
---
Returning player, 3 of my oldest characters are an Ele, Necro and Thief.
---
Are any of them considered "meta" for anything these days?
---
Yes please! My ring finger on my left hand only has about 50% movement due to an injury when I was younger so my hand movement is somewhat limited. As a result I need quite a tight set of key commands to be able to react. Classes such as warrior and thief are relatively easy with my set up but scourge and mesmer with the added f3-5 create problems and have rotations that require me to move my keybinds around to allow me the best access. My issue is relatively minor but I would imagine there are others in similar positions who this would be very helpful for.
---
Except guild halls and guilds are generally abandoned content at the moment, ever since HoT. I hope they will go back to them once Alliances update hits, in ~25 years.
---
release date?
---
Yup all have meta builds depending on the content. A new patch just came out with some changes but you can check out [raid builds here](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/), [fractals here](https://discretize.eu/builds), [WvW zerg builds here](http://builds.vabbi.org/), and [everything else on here](http://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki).
---
... by leaving the EU.
---
Which server would that be
---
Oh thanks!
---
Did the most stuff on my Ele, but man do I die in the open world :D
---
Obviously I lack both
---
I understand that. Im not sure why i just find it difficult to log on and just pick something. I guess chasing legendaries? Long term goals
---
Well, farming gold and buying the mats overall is the usual standard for getting them, but you could look into some maps like Frostgorge Sound or Cursed Shore for the "money week" where doing events in those maps (and several others but I don't remember them off the top of my head) give those kinds of materials.
---
Alternatively if you're sitting on some laurels you can afford to burn you can buy the material bags of the tier those mats are and get a few that way.
---
Btw does Aurene nest there just a fancy gravestone?
---
Who
---
Haven't even bothered trying. Fool me once and so on. They keep making the same mistake with third parties.
---
I don't remember the reason, but it's basically the same reason why other games run out of promotional codes like Steam and Humble Bundle. In HB you could have a bundle with 20 games in it but maybe five or so of them will have run out of keys so not everyone can get the full 20 games that was originally offered.
---
ghhhhhhhhhh
---
I'd understand physical goodies to be US only because of some laws, costs, logistics or whatever but region locking an old outfit is as dumb as it gets.

Maybe it could be cancelled automatically when leaving combat, and recharge faster while out of combat.
---
Right I forgot to mention it's a female human "ritualist". The flashy ones just don't fit but the starter scribe backpack fits quite well.
---
Pretty sure the only one that is messed up is SE P1 right? I have read you should kill the other Champ at the end since he is the one that actually drops loot, but I cant confirm that and nobody bothers killing him anyway.
---
All the others should drop normally. I definitely know CoF P1 still drops since I got another last week.
---
thank you for making this list :) with a select mount license and a adopt one in my inventory, i was looking at videoes yesterday planning my "adoption", but gave up xD This helps alot ! Way more organised ;D
---
Nope, HotW p1, Arah p1, CM P2 and coe P2 recipes don’t drop anymore
---
Easiest cheese build for soloing is blood magic with parasitic contagion with either viper or trailblazer gear. Trailblazer is expensive to make though, but gives you more chances to stay alive. I use it to solo fractals and 1 epidemic plus plaguelands pretty much heals me up to full no matter how much damage I'm taking (I'm talking about ticks of 70-100 with the lesser signet of vampirism that casts from time to time)
---
Hi all, I'm trying to get into the harder parts of Fractals. I've already managed to get 150AR and I've unlocked up to fractal 97. I want to try to do 100cm and I need some help with some meta builds. So what I'm asking is - which of my characters should I invest time and resources in?
---
I've got a daredevil thief - but from what I've heard it's a *great* build but not a *meta* build.
---
I've got a chronomancer  - But he barley has any exotic armor and chrono's are suddenly *not* the meta?
---
I've got a druid - Full ascended set but I need to farm more AR to get him up  
---
And I've got an empty character slot - I'm willing to invest in a character if that's what it takes to be in the fractal meta and right now it seems Bannerslave Warrior is a really good pick out of the classes.
---
&gt; D/P daredevil has been removed from PvP. All you have left is core s/d which isn't that strong in the grand scheme of things.
---
I can select D/P daredevil in pvp just fine
---
I have found that mixing some magi on the trinkets wont overcap your boon duration and gives you nice heals. Since patch i find that the little popping bubbles helps with keeping fellow party member in scholar range. No change on gameplay except for using staff2 when needed.
---
Go ahead and post a video I'll wait
---
They should just give the outfit to everyone and next time give non-exclusive rewards for promotions, like 5 BL keys or something.
---
Yet you keep replying....I don't date chicks from the internet so I dunno why ya keep stalking me
---
LOL drama on this reddit is what happens when Mount Skins are too expensive
---
Stop kidding yourself.
---
&gt;I’m sorry for your frustration but ALL gw promotions have been this way (even in gw1 when they did the mini pet giveaways on magazines?? It was the first days of the Motorola razor camera phone... guys took pictures of the codes in the magazine right in store so many many legit buyers who wanted the mini pet codes lost out since they got a magazine with an already used code)
---
Which is why people are so tired of this shit, anet are supposed to be professionals and you'd think that they would have learned from the first time this has happened, yet again they continue to do the exact same thing that didn't work the first 5 times.
---
EU stands both for Europe and the European Union. It's really not that hard to figure out which is meant, based on context.
---
Don't go phallic on me spitter
---
Either that or the devs were desperate to make the endgame nod as strong as possible... I hope you are right though &gt;.&lt;
---
Caveat: This is only for PVE. In WvW and PvP, where you actually need the defensive stats you use a lot of different stat combinations.

WvW Arc dps question. What options do you run? What really care about I guess would be dps and boon rips on a GvG and Open tag setting with arc resetting after a fight. Thanks in advance

Feels like a copy pasta of Star Wars posters.

I bought 800 gems for the first time since starting the game yesterday, with the sole purpose of buying a material storage upgrade cause it would free up alot of space for me and save me alot of inventory managment time.

But i have no willpower and when i saw these new horn cosmetics i insta bought it instead.

Oh. I'm sad now. Then how is there a permafrost dye in the trading Post? Someone just got extremely lucky with unidentified dyes?
---
Oh man my heart sank when you said birthday gift my dude, were it so easy...
---
Is not like you cant use 10 mins emails for it, thats how i got a few outfit codes in like 5 mins.
---
Been carrying t4 fractals with my buddy i play heal alacrigade and he plays quickness chrono.

We are not optimal but since we started playing this every single run as been a breeze. Îm trying to convince him to gear up his firebrand wish me good luck!
---
I seriously feel that I’m stark and Taimi is spiderman
---
Yep, thats why its so expensive
---
What is your game id
---
Ah, thanks for the info. At least now I'll look for a dye I like
---
Well, yes. Because an apostrophe is used to show where you are dropping some letters in a word and is therefore incorrectly used in your spelling of \*effing\*. If you wanted to use an apostrophe, you should have gone \*f'ing\*. That's enough to get on anyone's nerves.
---
You can loot the permafrost dye from the [Jormag dye kit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jormag_Dye_Kit) which is usually available in the gemstore during the Wintersday event.
---
they do not drop from unidentified dyes, but from the jormag dye kit (the version that drops tradable items is no longer available) - but the lucky part is true ;-)

She isn't, incels just like to believe out of context quotes and red pill youtubers.

Yeah, but I think there's also some achievement in one of the first raids that requires you beat the wing under the effect of bloodstone food or something. That may have been what I was thinking when I bought them.
---
Ah, of course. Thank you. I didn’t realise Mystic Coins became modern day Ectos and Armbraces.

That's what I figured. I heard something about her saying something about men watching the movie, but wasn't sure what, so I figured it could just be some offhand remark blown out of proportion.

No, she clearly is. Everything Leftists dont want to admit is ture gets blamed on "red pill Youtubers"

Minidungeons are not dungeons in meaning of that you need party, they are just special place, some are possible to do solo, but better and faster is doing them in group, but group i mean literally anyone around you, you dont need party them or anything, just be in the same place like others

I think those bundles were 100% charity ones and the reason they ran out of codes was most likely that certain publishers only gave them X amount of codes to include in that bundle.
---
Yup it's very desired in Fractals. Check the Discretize website. However I would suggest waiting a week or two since the balance patch just hit.
---
Gw1 was about humans, gw2 isn't just about them. Anet didn't get the memo
---
ok thank you :)

Yeah I figured I’d wait a bit. Thanks for your insights vagabond_**dildo**

It does not break the ToS, correct.
---
BUT it is fully at the user's risk, because we have no logging for it, no in-house processes, and often times if you get scammed, that's sadly that- We have limited means of recovering items, and scammers don't hang on to things as a rule.

/u/rude_asura is correct, we do talk at times about such issues, and anyone using the subreddit there should be aware of this, as the mods make it clear to folks, too.

At this point ANet should just release that outfit for free in gem store when this promo ends. They are just feeding scalpers at this point instead of their legitimate players.

---
Am new to GvG so mostly am looking to ensure I am spiking correctly with my team hence I think the damage would be good to check back on to ensure I am doing so efficiently along with the rest of the time although I imagine once this becomes second nature I can drop damage altogether.
---
It's full :(
---
For gvg yeah, for open tags it's usually irrelevant since high strips=high enough damage.
---
It's in a good spot. Don't be deceived by benchmarks though, it may be top tier DPS in golem but anything with short phases will make it dive into mediocrity because it has a long windup for its burst to kick in.
---
It's a very fun to play build and it requires active management of everything you got, I'd recommend it.
---
We won't even avenge them, I swear they're further dragging the Kralk plot...
---
Does anyone have any screenshots of the Polysaturating Reverberating Infusion (Purple) over Zodiac Armor?
---
Yeah Thiefes can pull of great dps in instances, I too pick them quite regularly into WvW because they're aids to deal with but for PvE I find them just as squishy as Elementalists.
---
Depends on your group or what kind of content you're running, you don't need to pick meta classes - in most cases all classes can pull semi good numbers. Still in this game there are some classes that are usually reknown for their performance. Guardians, Elementalists etc. find it rather easy joining PvE groups since its well known they perform accordingly so noone is questioning that.
---
If you bring some weird classes for PvE dps like Revenant or Necromancer you might get some snide remarks from random PUGs so you better mentally prepare for that.
---
So to speak you need to defend your classchoice with every group you join, especially if you're pugging a lot and run with less experienced players who just know the core meta but not its side builds.
---
A good buddy of mine just semi-quit his power Reaper(Necromancer Elite) main for he got judged everytime running with randoms, noone cared that he outdamaged them in every single encounter (I've seen the logs ffs), now he plays Soulbeast(Ranger Elite) for they burst as strong or stronger than Elementalists or Guardians. If you don't want to justify yourself everytime just skip out on those weird choices, don't go for condition classes and go fullzerk.
---
Just as a quick note, if you're just wanting to get an ascended weapon, check the specialized collections from the expansions.  Both classes now have 2 free ascended weapons, that you can knock out in a few hours/few days of game play depending on your luck with group events.
---
pretty sure robots are built to arrive at logical choices, but you didn't hear that from meee

---
I run a variation of the sword/pistol setup with different amounts of toughness depending on how comfortable my group is with dpsing the boss.
---
Setup stealth with Shadow Refuge and Steal. Pistol whip after the third stack of hands after taking damage to force regeneration. Maintain stealth with pistol 5 and bound, using weapon swap during that for healing and extra initiative. Any evades made during that should lower steal CD (doesn't work at the moment due to swipe) so you can use that more regularly. I save any utility stealth skills aside from shadow refuge sub 60% in case an add spawns as I land bound.
---
Damage reduction is through remaining stealthed constantly. Heal with regen and weapon swap. Daredevil heal for emergencies. Block mind wrack (or whatever it is) with Bandit's Defense.

Get TunnelBear, this software saved so much of my time with the launcher stuck at 0% or 1 file remaining.

I quit ESO because I got bored of the combat system and I heard it's similar. Old style mmorpgs are a snorefest for me after being exposed to more action combat like BDO, Tera, GW2, Blade and Soul. If only BDO's combat was put into a slightly more themepark mmorpg. It would be amazing. I'd even pay sub for it if it meant it wasn't P2W.

i did supply them the expansion cdkey.

I got the outfit code, but not the mini egg.  It's not listed as a reward on the website.  I thought maybe it was joint with the outfit and used the code despite already having the outfit.  So now I have a useless account bound already unlocked outfit, when there are plenty of people who would have liked the code (I could have given it to my sister who also plays, or done some sort of giveaway in LA or my guild)
---
My two gripes are that you shouldn't be able to misclick and "rush" any blueprint that takes less than 5 minutes, and they need to take the mod bundles down.

Everything else is great.

Absolutely. Can't imagine "I don't feel like setting up keybinds for new characters" to be a legitimate complaint at all.
---
1,310 days then ...

Anet said their point is to make trade off. But this trade off crippled the core design of warrior..remove burst skill at all. Even other class they still have their class-unique skill when outside of their mode (like slb, holo, reaper), but warrior now have to suffer for this ? 
---
If anet insist this is right direction. Remove other class's unique skill too when they use spec that give them a mode to active.
---
Most of the system/UI settings in FFXIV could come to GW2, and most of the Quality of Life/freedom in GW2 could go to FFXIV.
---
Fine. Then we've been playing as *Faren.*
---
Hm its more like, in instanced content, you will be part of a team who can cover up your deficiencies. In raids you have healers providing might and fury and buffers providing quickness and the likes. Therefore, the builds are designed for max damage output (the dps builds mind you). Not so much because of the toughness fking up tanking.

My trustworthiness is moot, as I’m not running a trading post black market.

Chronos used to be *game-breakingly overpowered*. Now they're just pretty good. An experienced support chronomancer is always in demand and they can more than hold their own as DPS. If you enjoy the mesmer playstyle, it's in a good position at the moment so go for it.

This is something I love on FFXIV, especially when fighting smaller sized bosses. Most FFXIV raid-level mechanics are "if you goof up you kill the entire raid" so it's super important to actually see the shit going on. Once we've got it on farm I can turn the pretty colors back on.

Can we please stop getting "LIMITED QUANTITY" codes that just wind up being claimed by a few and resold?   Why can't this be tied to API and unlimited quantity (just limited time)?

- Death Shroud doesnt activate Sigil of Agility and possibly other weapon swap sigils

- Locust Swarm does not proc Vampiric or any other on-hit effects because it is now life siphon instead of damage, also because of this any on-hit effects and damage modifiers do no apply to it

Fractal meta has recently shifted from druid chrono comp to firebrand renegade. Nowadays even pugs go for Firebrigade since it’s just better: faster booms, bigger aoe, and higher dps. So, if you’re planning on using druid or chrono in fractals, just don’t. Especially with the recent druid nerfs, druid chrono is just not as good. Druid chrono is still great in raids though, so that’s up to you.
---
What is considered meta is dragonhunter, soulbeast, Weaver, and holosmith to some extent. These are your go to dps classes, which are good in fractals because of their high bursts which is favored in the short phases of fractals. Then of course, you have supports: bs warrior, quickbrand, and alacrigade. Bs warrior is the one we’ve always known and loved, while quickbrand and alacrigade both have hybrid dps and heal builds, hybrid being a mix of diviner and berserker, and heal being full harrier (or minstrel if you have that from wvw). You want both heal and hybrid just in case the other support player only has one build, as you only want 1 healer and 1 dps for highest group dps.
---
Tl;dr: Don’t gear chrono or druid for fractals. If you want dps: dh, Weaver, slb, holo. Support: bs, firebrigade.
---
Good luck!
---
oh there is such a thing, thank you for nicely telling me this :)

SBI actually has a decent WvW presence during OCX/SEA times. I know because I'm fighting them. You need to take into account that the wvwstats figures I believe are based on PPT value. So if you're fighting against similar or superior numbers e.g. DB SEA is generally massive even on a bad day, then even if you have people you're not going to dominate.  
---
To give a real example, when it was Kaineng vs Dragonbrand vs Yak's Bend last week. During SEA time DB quite regularly own all 4 maps. Kaineng has like 5 people just roaming/backcapping. YB has maybe 15-20 and based on the guild tags I saw, half of them were GoM guilds, not even YB guilds. Meanwhile the DB + IoJ combo usually has one big group and multiple small groups running around.   
---
Meanwhile, this weekwith SBI in the matchup, DB +IoJ struggled during the weekend during SEA against the SBI + DR combo, and even today it's roughly even for the most part.

---
As a member of a couple guilds (and leader of a small, personal guild that mostly acts as a shared bank), guilds help enrich the Guild Wars 2 experience. It's right there in the title of the game, in fact.
---
Guilds enable willing and motivated players to engage in high-end content with consistency and great results by offering structured scheduling, pooling of resources, and generating interest and hype to keep its players motivated. World Event bosses became something I had mostly ignored unless I specifically needed something, but with guild leaders that organize and run closed metas and facilitate fast and lucrative takedowns, sometimes while also employing fun giveaways and team chat through Discord, I've begun going to these events more often. Some guilds run weekly Hero Point trains, enabling up-and-coming players, or even those just wanting to try out a new character, to get Hero Points throughout Maguuma and the Crystal Desert with general ease.
---
Guild Halls act as private havens, offering unmatched boons such as the Guild Booster tonics, daily harvesting nodes, portal access to certain events/areas, and battle arenas to try out builds against friends. They also offer a variety of merchants and can be decorated to suit your specific group's tastes.
---
There are plenty of other benefits to having a guild, but I'll let a large guild leader discuss that lol

Hi!

With recent update GeForce Experience introduced filters to their Game Overlay system. I'd say it's pretty decent alternative to GW2Hook, it's more limited but doesn't require you to download/use any shaders and I didn't notice any performance drops while using it. If you want to see more screenshots you can go to \[this image album\]([https://imgur.com/a/BoSBjFA](https://imgur.com/a/BoSBjFA)) or if you want comparison/reference go to \[this album\]([https://imgur.com/a/wMO5bkv](https://imgur.com/a/wMO5bkv)).

You can also do some funky stuff with it like adding stickers to the game or changing skybox to green screen but I haven't played with it much so can't say much :)
---
This particular meme stopped being funny when it became overused by gamers.

Charr ele
---
Warrior mechanics are simple, no more analysis is needed, now that rage skills only gives more berserk duration, berserker is lacking adrenaline gain,  you can't land decapitate as often as you want because of it.
---
On the other hand, while berserk is on CD we are even more useless than a warrior with two traitlines equipped.
---
Core Warrior is strong, balanced. SB is  defensive, and berserker is offensive as hell, but the sustain/damage trade off isn't worth it yet, because it feels clunky, limited (if we talk about rotations)
---
It also didn't work, Thank you though.

I don't even see the outfit, where is that supposed to be?

While the most widely recognized form of spam is email spam, the term is applied to similar abuses in other media: instant messaging spam, Usenet newsgroup spam, Web search engine spam, spam in blogs, wiki spam, online classified ads spam, mobile phone messaging spam, Internet forum spam,  junk fax transmissions, social spam, spam mobile apps, television advertising and file sharing spam. It is named after Spam, a luncheon meat, by way of a Monty Python sketch about a restaurant that has Spam in every dish and where patrons annoyingly chant "Spam!" over and over again.Spamming remains economically viable because advertisers have no operating costs beyond the management of their mailing lists, servers, infrastructures, IP ranges, and domain names, and it is difficult to hold senders accountable for their mass mailings. The costs, such as lost productivity and fraud, are borne by the public and by Internet service providers, which have been forced to add extra capacity to cope with the volume.

I feel the same, but where else is arenanet gonna get the cash injection they need after the past few months? Seems like they're experimenting with new marketing strategies in the wake of the whole staff fiasco. If I were in their position I'd be pressed to do the same
---
Only if they also introduce tribulation mode open world.
---
Ahh, that makes much more sense now. Thanks for reassuring me.
---
Wow look at that. Thanks bot!

Will be really helpful for  /u/[neok182](https://www.reddit.com/user/neok182)

Kleenex Hills from above.
---
How do you claim the 25$ for the dell rewards? Its in my reward section but cant click on it or anything.
---
1.1: This game is not P2W, the only thing sold at the gem shop is Skins and cosmetic stuff. Including mount skins.  
---
1.2: Jessica has done something like that in their last previous jobs. She's manipulating media but if you search further you'll see she's the one creating the issues.  
---
1.3: Yup, right before 1st expansion there was a content drought. That was 4 years ago. After that, Anet basically created 2 teams, one that is constantly developing live stuff and one focusing on expansions, so we never had another content drought.
---
I dunno.  I got the Shirt and Egg with three minutes of effort.  It took another minute more to add Alienware to my email filter.
---
I'm pugging CMs with 5 DDs for some days now, its fun running Firebrigade with both participants going for damage.
---
Since Warrior Banner got nerfed some Months ago it was debatable picking BS into a Druid/Chrono composition where only 2 slots were open for dps. Some DDs allready overcap on crit and since warrior burst is inferior to so many "real" dps specs you usually filled the role with just another DD.
---
Firebrigade has in its core 5 dps roles to fill so your BS can do a proper job of buffing the team with its banners. 
---
Sure bringing a healer for CMs might be the better choice for starters but Druids indeed are just glorified Boonsupporter that are not performing accordingly, if you so happen to choose a Firebrand can be a real carry with its healing abilities, usually Renegades can fill this role too but they lack the hps output ^(just like Druids).
---
Ranger, Elementalist, Guardian and Engineer are indeed strong choices for dps, maybe a Thief too.  
---
In my Opinion going for a Guardian might be a good choice since it can fill four different roles in fractals, Power Burst DPS Dragonhunter, Condition Burst DPS Firebrand, Support Quickbrand and even Healbrand are solid. Its the most versetile class for fractals at the moment.
---
Take it with a grain of salt for I really don't like -only- dps classes or -only- support:
---
*Second most versetile would still be Mesmer for you can play it as Support Chronomancer and can occasionally pick it into a Firebrigade combo if either Quickbrand or Alacrene is missing since Chrono supports both Quickness and Alacrity. Also Power Chronomancer is solid, recent patches changed its playstyle and made him kinda bursty if played correctly. You still have Condition Mirage and Tank Chrono for raids, also in PvP its cancerous to play against.*
---
How does it dick over your team in fractals?  While a boon chrono isn't the best dps, it still has decent dps, extremely high cc, and provides the group with quickness and alacrity along with other utilities.  Just because you can beat a fractal a minute faster with higher dps doesnt mean a chrono wont help smooth out a run.
---
But it's a responsibility being a berserk.
---
if it would be one of the mid-level zones 20-60 i wouldn't care, but the asura starter zone is one of my favorites and I think starter zones should always  be one of the less frustration to play since new player will get their first impression with them
---
Did you enter the code into the right place?  There are two UI in the GW2 game where you can redeem codes - one for redeeming gems and the other for redeeming items.
---
Nope, 70 is maximum.
---
I miss solo ecto farming in the underworld with a ritualist. Those were the days
---
NONO, only war can suffer loosing 20 skills from banners,bcs he has so many of usefull utilities,not like engi which have 5 on toolbelt and have 3 extra weapon swaps. i dont know whos balancing in anet,but he hates warriors so much.
---
I’ll respond to 2/3 in edits later but as far as #1:
---
1.1. People claim P2W because of elite specialization being locked behind expansions since they are most of the time categorically stronger  than their vase counterparts.  Only other thing that was remotely P2W was the (now called) glyphs for gathering tools as they were originally released on gemstore only tools and not traceable in game (this has since been pretty much resolved via the glyphs being tossed into the gemstore’s lootboxes and being tradeable)
---
1.2. The JP incident was an unfortunate one and one of a whole lot of mixed messages from her, news outlets, and Anet.  It all comes down to who do you trust to be closest to truthful &amp; observing the factual things that were publicly observable. Re: her tweets that day to and from deroir &amp; the firing announcement.  The rest is basically hearsay.
---
1.3. When the first expansion released, there was a huge long tailed hype train full of what the expansion pack would contain and the planned release rate and dates.  Dates were missed, the expansion wasn’t what players were expecting and there was a really strong backlash.  As a result anet clammed up.  The director at the time then left for an opportunity at Amazon.  After that Anet’s CEO took on the director role on top of his other work and decided that anet would only communicate on delivery.  After the ~35%(?) lay-off, the current director (Mike Z) gave us a layout of the plans while stressing strongly that any beyond near future were tentative and not guaranteed.
---
No one here is saying the build is not fun. But if you want to do end game content with groups, you also need a class that has the numbers.
---
but exploding is literally part of the rotation and for open word you can just use the capacity module
---
This is what bugs me the most. I would have loved something like this as a season-wide base of operations, but they confined it to one episode. Even though it gets its seperate port scroll. 
---
Next season, I want this base to be established right from the beginning, and be used and upgraded for an entire year and a half.
---
Just be yourself
---
where did I forget!? fuck!
---
Well, this kind of flame can be found from trash to high level, so ... :s
---
But you won't be under the same laws that apply in the EU which is both the whole point of Brexit and the whole point of why certain regions get certain rewards while other don't. Canada didn't get excluded from this event because ArenaNet can't deliver a code to someone north of the US border, they got excluded because Canada has different laws from the US and would require different legal workings to do it.
---
After you Brexit your country you will segregate yourselves from the majority of people in Europe, thus making your market share for promotions like this less likely to fall into the easiest possible catchment for a promotion and less likely to be included.
---
ArenaNet doesn't care about your land mass, they care about your laws. Currently the EU share laws, after Brexit, the UK will have their own laws.
---
I signed up yesterday afternoon and completed the account registration. Never even saw a way to get the outfit. Only saw the mini-egg and got $25 from Dell, which I have no idea how one even accesses after the fact. Did not even know about the outfit until someone linked in-game. I am in US so I should have seen the potential for the outfit key on my newly create AWA account.
---
For a collaboration event, I found it extremely lackluster when one could create multiple accounts, could then apply rewards to one GW2 account thus removing available keys for anyone else, and the keys depleted in less than a day. How is this supposed to continue for a week?
---
Definitely agree with this. The main thing that usually pisses people off is when someone falsely advertise something e.g. pretending to be experienced when they're not. When you make it clear in your lfg/map chat that you want to do something a certain way, the people who will respond usually have similar intentions or at least are willing to spend some extra time guiding a newbie(you) through it.
---
For example two friends and I went to do arah explorable because we wanted the achievement. We put up the LFG and said clearly that we're doing all arah paths for achievement, and we have no experience. Two other people joined us, one had a lot of experience and wanted to help out, another was new to it, just like we were. We ended up spending like 5 hours straight doing the arah explorable paths and nobody complained. Because everybody was clear on what the plan and the expectations were.
---
Heh, fair point. That's probably what they got.
---
Thank you for the response. This is very useful. :)

sometimes a monopoly can be a good thing. imagine how good your life would be if there wouldnt be 5 different game launchers, but just steam.   
---
And the thing with these giveaways is, that they want exposure. But you dont get exposure on the website of fucking alienware. You get exposure on twitch, where people *watch your game and get interested in it*. And if you don't push it there, then you might as well not push it at all.
---
My showed “Community Votes 0/20”. No where to find out how you vote for anything.

The analysis is for you to support your idea. Posting empty statements will not give you attention and definitely won't help you persuading people.

I’m all for them not being on Twitch because I am usually 90% unable to participate due to work.
---
Berserker as it is is a bit clunky. But I trust the devs to make it more streamlined with future patches. As of now, my personal bias having a condi berserker:
---
\-The cooldown. Ok, you do have your ways to extend berserket. But having 15 seconds where your options are very limited sucks. So you got weapon skills....should you use your rage skills? Should you save them for berserker? Obviously second option is theoretically better...so, no rage skills for 15 seconds.
---
\-Something I can't understand quite yet. I know my build is a bit different, but.... Got the sword, the torch and the longbow traits. Yet I can dish out more damage alone with the longbow at melee range than with the Sword/Torch. Wasn't, you know, melee weapons supposed to be more rewarding? What I think it have been happening is: With sword/torch, Berserker feels extremaly short. Flaming Furry , with its 2,5 duration and ok-ish damage, leaves less time to use rage skills. So, berserker can't be extended properly.
---
Thanks it seems the common reply I've seen is DPS DH and maybe Thief/DD...that gives me an idea on what classes to work on for raids. Thanks all.
---
Yes, I did. In the gems redeem code option, In the redeem Items option, in the games website. All three, my code just doesn't work.
---
If you think Dell makes bad computers don't buy anything HP makes that is consumer oriented. They just self destruct.
---
My current gaming laptop is an Asus ROG Strix GL503, and I am very satisfied so far. It is my second Asus laptop, the first one was not for gaming though, and I am very happy with both purchases. 
---
I've owned laptops by Dell, HP, Acer, Asus, Toshiba, and Sony. I would not buy an HP or Dell product again, especially not HP.
---
Balance patch only buffed Guardians.
---
Dragonhunter are reknown for good dps and they're so famous that even the most casual of fractal PUG groups have heard of it. There is noone looking at you funny if you bring a Dragonhunter for dps compared to a Necromancer or Revenant wich are usually belittled by groups...
---
I'm a returning player, only for a week now after a 5 year break. 
---
Either this week or the next week, I will start looking for a guild because the social aspect as minimum. I'm a casual player, enjoy most content but I lack time. The Guilds let me enjoy different types of content more easily and enjoy the social part of an MMO. 
---
Also, showing off fancy gear and wacky outfits is always nice.
---
The outfit is the same one from the Kung Fu Tea one, right?
---
from memory, you can get the boost even if you don't own an expac. So they can't give you expac stats on the equipment.
---
I'm from NYC, my skins pretty thick. Negativity = NY hello.
---
Ticks per second is pretty redundant, because tick already implies per second.
---
Ticks are independent from FPS. Take CSGO, for example. Most serious players aim for 300 FPS, yet the highest tick rate is 128, and 64 for Valve servers. You can have a higher FPS than the servers tick rate, because tick is essentially how often the server confirms things, not displays things. In the end it doesn't really matter what the client sees, which is why with high ping matches you can shoot someone in the head, see the blood marks, but have the server disagree and they take no damage.
---
MMOs will work mostly the same way. Granted with less precise individual actions than something like an FPS. GW2 isn't paying attention to every single frame of what you are doing. This is why when you hit a lag spike, you can still move around freely, yet can't perform literally any action. The actions are what the server needs to confirm, not so much 100% real-time movement.
---
The problems with FPS have nothing to do with the server tick rate. GW2s server is probably using a tick rate way lower than any frame rate that would be playable for a human. You list that it's 30, but I highly doubt that since most MMOs use single digit tick rates. We just do not perform enough actions to justify a tick rate that high, but hey, I could be wrong here. I do know that movement isn't tied to the server though. There are speed and teleport hacks for GW2, so the game mostly trusts what the client says for movement, it's just going to update where you are for everyone else at it's tick rate.
---
The game uses an old, and frankly not very good engine. It was developed in a time where engines depended on single core performance. Multiple cores weren't really a thing back then, and single core performance hasn't improved much since the game came out. This is why the game runs more or less the same from high end PCs at launch. The bottleneck has always been CPU. It's always been unoptimized there, and future tech hasn't helped because the game doesn't really take advantage of our other cores.
---
I made the account yesterday and got no code. Apparently you had to click the link in the blog to register, and this was after searching through the site with my main account for the outfit code and by time I got to getting a third account together after figuring that out no more codes.
---
I emailed support to have the second account closed so oh well.
---
That is one of the few that lives up the the name of mini-dungeon.
---
be that it may, the message is still relevant.
---
it's pretty obvious that anet didn't test extensively (or had anyone who can play warriors worth a damn). if they did, they surely would have noticed that the point of berserk mode isn't to stay in it as long as possible. rather, it's more important to be able to enter (and leave) berserk mode as OFTEN as possible, which allows the berserker to take advantage of berserker traits more often.
---
as a result, the current changes to rage skills make no sense. it is pointless to extend the duration of berserk mode, because it means that you can't take advantage of on-activate traits as often. this is compounded by the defensive penalty when berserk mode is active: you want to minimize the amount of time actually spent in berserk mode to better avoid the toughness penalty, and the best way to do this (outside of taking the bonus toughness trait), is to keep berserk mode duration down.
---
i think having rage skills reduce the cooldown of berserk mode would be a much more interesting choice.
---
i also think that berserker should have the same adrenaline system as spellbreakers, in that they still get access to level 1 bursts with a 2-bar adrenaline system. berserk mode would be a 1 bar activation and counts as a level 1 burst instead.
---
Elementslists are A LOT of fun. I don’t have much to add past that. Tempest &amp; Weaver are great elite specs and add different styles to the core elementalist play styles.
---
Open some weird account? You get the 25$ on a Dell store account that shares the same email as your Alienware account. 
---
Are you ok?
---
Are people cool with Power DPS warrior not running Banners? I've heard things...
---
1) 
---
* The shop released an item called a mount license, which gave you access to a single skin per purchase, randomly picked between the different mounts, for 400 gems ($5). The problem here was that there were 30 mount skins available, distributed between the different mounts, and you were paying 400 gems to randomly get one. If you only liked maybe 3 of them, you paid 400 gems for a 1/10 chance of getting anything you liked. You can read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7bevvt/mount_adoption_licenses_are_an_outrage/)
---
* The feminist employee incident was when a former employee was asked some questions about developing the game from one of the GW2 partners, but was asked in such a way that she felt like he was trying to effectively mansplain development to her. She then called him a "rando asshat" using her twitter account, which, although personal, did state that she worked for ArenaNet, and made it clear that she had no intention of playing nice because she didn't have to outside of work hours. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/8wkvbo/the_tragedy_of_jessica_price_and_peter_fries/) is more information on that one
---
* Pretty recently, a large chunk of employees (~140) were laid off from the company because of NCsoft, the parent company, stepping in. Apparently a lot of those employees were working on separate projects distinct from GW2, and it made it feel like this game was on the back burner. They're still recoiling from that right now, but it seems like they've tried making some steps already to fix their problems.
---
2) The endgame is largely PvE based actually. Every few months, we get a new addition to the game called a living world episode, which brings the next piece of the story and a new map, all for free if you're online during the 3 month window after its release. With the living world releases, we also switch off between a fractal release (5 man content) and a raid release (10 man content). This most recent release we got Siren's Reef, a fractal, so we'll be getting a raid release next.
---
The PvP is split into two modes, sPvP and WvW. 
---
* In sPvP, it's 5 vs 5 matches where you try to claim and hold 3 nodes for points. In this mode, gear is normalized, so no one can bring super OP gear and just one shot everyone. A level 2 player will have the same gear stat level as a level 80 player. All you get to choose are your skills, traits, and what combination of stats you want. So you could build a character that's focused on conditions, on support, on power, etc, and you'll have equivalent gear level but different stat compositions. There are some balance patches that come through that change up the meta, and they definitely try to do...something with the balance, but there's also definitely some classes that are just better at certain roles.
---
* WvW on the other hand uses the gear that you earn from PvE, and stages a large scale turf war across 3 servers, spread across 4 maps. Again, there are some classes which are definitely more desired than others, but nothing that is so oppressive that you'll feel the need to always swap around. 
---
3) It's a reasonably smaller studio, compared to other MMOs, but the rate of patches can sometimes feel unreasonably slow. There are some people who just play the game once every few months, finish the story again, and just leave again. 
---
There's no real difficult gear grind, which I'm personally fine with, but there are definitely other people who wonder why you would only want to grind out for cosmetics at end game. Both expansions have brought enhancements to the game, but what they did not bring, unlike WoW, was a level cap increase or a gear tier increase. This is great for players like me who don't feel like always spending time catching up as soon as the level cap increases and my gear becomes obsolete, but it's a problem for players who want that grind to feel like they've accomplished something.
---
&gt;  I have no idea how this game didn't kill WoW
---
You'll see the problems when they come. And do be honest, when the game first came out, it was a very different state than it is now, with practically no real endgame content.
---
Apparently people are selling outfit codes for mystic coins in map chat.
---
He's not wrong at all though, Alienware didn't get handed a key generator and told to go nuts, they were given a list of keys to give out, and the demand was probably higher than they expected / they didn't account for bots. This isn't two big friendly companies just helping each other out because it's a cold, hard world, this is a business approaching a business and saying, "If you provide us (amount) of (item), we will use it to promote our product, and give you (money amount) for those keys and rights to distribute. This will help us sell our product, and you get money and advertising for yours" and then they get what the contract was for, and do their best to reach as many people as possible. Unfortunately, they got a lot of bots and didn't get enough keys, so it flopped. I'm not saying this was a well done / planned giveaway, but the commenter above you was right on the dot, IMO it's good that they at least have this seemingly-infinite giveaway item of the mini eggs, because to new players, the ones we need to make sure are getting involved and feeling welcomed, a free mini egg would be a cool thing to get and might get a handful of them to stick around, while also not devaluing something that's a hot commodity for established players, or saying "you're too slow you got nothing" and discouraging them completely
---
Wait stop. Do you mean that I can simply not participate in this entirely optional event and not be effected in any way?
---
Any laptop that has a good price/performance ratio will not have the best build quality, but some laptops are build to disintegrate \*cough\*HP\*cough\*. Alienware is usually close to the rest but they have had a few expensive models in the last 4 years with subpar build quality compared to previous Alienware products. Which is a shame since they are usually slightly more expensive than the competition.
---
just got wrecked by them in eternal battlegrounds
---
I do computer repair.
---
Low level HP and Dell laptops are absolute garbage but the high level products are fairly good quality.  HPs AiO units are actually surprisingly good quality.
---
Thx will wait a bit before changing anything on my warrior, gearing my firebrand anyway so it's alright  ^^

https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/231272908-Known-Issue-Tracker
---
The last update to the issue tracker was 2, the last fixed issue 3 months ago. Don't get your hopes up.
---
Thanks. Never seen a post about it here myself so I wasn't sure.
---
Oh yeah HP is a big no no for me. My father being really slow with technology still hoards HP laptops that are plain bad, but I have an MSI for myself. Its been 4 years though so I'm looking for a new one soon. Asus or MSI again were my bets.
---
1.
---
&gt; something to do with the shop (P2W or something with the mounts? don't remember)
---
It's not as bad as it was.  They lock a bunch of mount skins behind, what is essentially a lootbox that gives you a random mount.  Originally, that was the *only* way to unlock those skins.  So if you wanted one specific skin, good luck.  They later added a coupon to select a skin from the lootbox, so it's not nearly as bad now.
---
I would consider the GW2 shop pretty non-P2W.  Storage is pretty much necessary for endgame play, but pretty much everything else is convenience or cosmetic.  Even the ability to buy in-game currency with $$$ doesn't really matter since everything high-end in GW2 is cosmetic anyways.
---
&gt; the insane feminist employees (that were fired) 
---
I think there was only one employee that truly seemed out of line during that situation, the other employee that was fired was stepping in on twitter to defend her, and was a beloved developed.
---
&gt; there was a period of time where the developers were super quiet about content creation and delivery (that has since been addressed and presumably will be resolved soon as well?).  
---
This hasn't been an issue for a long while, maybe since Heart of Thorns days during the year long content drought.  They've been extremely open with us as of late about their content delivery plans.  We're about to get the finale of Season 4 of Living World, then we go straight into Season 5.
---
&gt; 2. What is the endgame like? 
---
Endgame is what you make it in GW2.  There is no gear grind, so you can do whatever you want.  There is Fractals (dungeons) and Raids in PvE for instanced endgame content.  Open world endgame largely consists of farming zergy map metas and world bosses for gold and currency towards buying cosmetics, but there are also so many achievements in this game that it will take you years to complete them, so you can do that too. 
---
There is PvP or World vs. World as well.  PvP is a standard capture-point based 5v5 team game with a ranked ladder and automated tournaments.  WvW is largescale server vs. server vs. server warfare over keeps and castles and such. There are tons of ways to play WvW, and it can be a lot of fun if you find a group to run with.
---
&gt;3. Can you as honestly as possible tell me what you don't like about the game if there are things you don't like? 
---
A few things on the top of my head
---
* The game struggles to consistently give rewarding loot from enemies.  You just salvage thousands of pieces of crap gear for some crafting materials to use or sell towards nice shiny stuff. 
---
* Although ANet has picked up the pace recently, I find the meta in GW2 to be very stagnant across all game modes (especially PvE and WvW).  ArenaNet has been amazing about buffing weak classes and builds lately, but they're slow to push OP classes out of the meta. Every balance patch a new build or two might jump in or out of the meta, but it takes years to see a true shift in meta. 
---
* Lack of vertical progression isn't for everyone
---
* Core tyria (level 1-80 "core" maps) have really not aged well in most aspects; visually or gameplay.  We had massive power creep a few years back and it has caused the core game to become very easy.  It's not until the expansions that you actually face challenge.
---
I'm fine with there being more game launchers. Valve takes a HUGE cut from every sale. I've been to valve, and this is why they can afford to have such a lax corporate environment, because of their Steam "f you" money. Putting more money into the hands of the game devs themselves is a better thing imo.
---
Mistlock DOES return you to your original location. That's why it is always suggested , over the other ones.
---
Quickbrand is not really on par with warrior - bad warriors, maybe, but it's still less than that of a war. 
---
The FB has a lot of utility and isn't 'cucked' (awful term to use btw) by tablet positioning, which - for your average pug - I really wouldn't count on, not MAMA of all bosses. That tablet will barely do anything if pugs aren't stacked right on top of it (they won't, often, and the tablet). FB heals are a LOT more 'hard carry' than ren heals, even if ren heals seem stronger. 
---
It really won't make a difference at all for most pugs if they need a healer. Pugs currently don't really care which one heals as long as they have some form of heals, and I've seen more requests for FB heals than Ren heals. 
---
You shouldn't be expecting this level of DPS optimization in pugs anyway - form a fractal static group, perhaps? That way you'll always know what you're getting.
---
Dungeons/Fractals - Can be excellent in an organized group, probably not ideal for a pug setup. In a perfect world your group would provide Spotter + 100% slow up time. That is far from guaranteed in a 5 man.
---
Raids - With 10 man groups it is a lot easier to provide 100% slow up time and you will almost always have spotter. So they are a bit better. Not meta due to lack of any meaningful support or utility contribution but still absolutely fine.
---
Open World - Mesmer is pretty great in the open world but for soloing stuff you are going to want a GS on switch, and your DPS will be lower due to lack of slow. You can provide it for yourself in bursts with time warp and well of action though.
---
I want them to do this every three months or so
---
if this is supposed to be about the availability of expertise and concentration, giver's and bringer's gear would like to have a word with you.
---
Then you don't bill the offer as "Do the thing between date A and date B and we will give you X, Y, and Z."
---
Instead, don't mislead people. Tell them, "We have 50,000 of X, Y, and Z to give out! First 50,000 to do the thing get them!"
---
As far as structuring things to be beyond manipulation and abuse, that's a more technical question, but for GW2, a great start would be to make all promotional awards, when redeemed, set some sort of about variable from a 0 to a 1. Any attempts to open the item after that yields an error and consumes the item to yield useless junk instead of the loot (kind of like how Teq drops spoons, but once your account has it, he drops only broken spoons). 
---
This would still allow selling of boxes though, but maybe they could arrange something in the code generator to address this...like the code can only be used with the email address used to generate it (which would mean you would have to use your about email for the offer)?
---
Ah, so celestial gear that would give conc/expert is locked behind expansions? That's very unfortunate...
---

While I wouldn't be opposed to having two more stats on my Celestial Armor for one of my characters, I would wonder if they would lower the stats granted to other stats to compensate. As it stands, the more attributes a piece of gear impacts, the higher your overall, aggregated attribute point total climbs
---
See [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Attribute_combinations#Attribute_bonuses_at_level_80) link for more details, but here's a short breakdown:
---
Berserker Two-Handed Weapon Attributes Granted: 251 Power, 179 Precision, 179 Ferocity = **609 Attribute Points Total**
---
Marauder Two-handed Weapon Attributes Granted: 215 Power, 215 Precision, 118 Vitality, 118 Ferocity = **666 Attribute Points Total**
---
Celestial Two-handed Weapon Attributes Granted: All stats except Concentration and Expertise 118 (so *7) = **826 Attribute Points Total**
---
3 Stats vs 4 Stats is already a fairly sizeable leap in total attribute points, but Celestial takes that to an entirely new level. One might argue "well the stats are so spread out, what use are they?" but at varying points in the history of the game Celestial was fairly successful. Heck I'm running a Weaver in WvW that utilizes Celestial on all his armor and have been able to fight in 1v3's and have a good shot at winning, because the variety of elements makes use of every stat provided.
---
Adding in Concentration and Expertise without lowering the other 7 stats to some degree would be a bit obscene, in my opinion as someone who actively (and unironically) runs the stat combination in my day-to-day.
---
Just remove the last picture, guy was laid-off back in February
---
&gt; the government alternative is worse, because guess what the government is slow and doesnt have a clue about the gaming industry.
---
So you don't want them to protect consumers at all cause they are always slow at doing this?
---
I did everything yesterday afternoon, so about 20hrs ago. Never saw key for outfit during that time. Only saw key for mini, the $25 for dell, and the other Dell thing. Didnt even know it existed until late last night, several hours after I completed it, when someone linked in game. I am in US and should have seen the possibility or even it saying 0 keys...
---
Its not. It doesn't exist
---
It's how most Dell/Alienware promos go. They get X amount of codes from a company then run the promo. The limited supply for stuff people actually want means people are more likely to sign up for their email service where they can feed you ads. It's marketing 101.
---
Anet isn't running the promo, all they get is a little exposure. Maybe call it disingenuous, Anet did advertise the promo on its site, but the pitchforks should be for Dell if anyone. I would bet Anet would generate more keys for them if Dell wanted them.
---
I think I’d rather keep my mystic coins :)
---
Wow, thats well explained.
---
also, I guess CS referes to Continuum split?
---
Could you maybe explain when to use it? I watched some guide where people managed to get every skill off cooldown after using CS.
---
No, stat combination existed before expansions, so adding those stats would introduce the expac stats to items owned by non expansion players, which as i understand they do not want.
---
Same. Day one and everything gone. 6 more days to go for nothing.
---
Yeah I can see where this is kind of an annoyance, but there has to be a trade-off for entering Berserk mode.  It would be pretty cheesy to allow players to go Berserk, land a flurry of fast-hitting crits followed by a massive rage crit, and then bail out before the enemy (or player) can respond.  If you're going to go Berserk, then you need to prepare to commit to it.
---
Regarding competitive modes, I don't think we should start extensively splitting profession mechanics between modes.
---
Take a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars2Builds/comments/7w2q7q/pve_open_world_power_chronomancer_build_february/), it's an old build and I haven't played power chrono in a while but I think it should still work. 
---
There's also the option of going condi mirage.
---
But celestial gear doesn't give a "bonus to all stats", it increases certains stats just like any other gear and these certain stats are all core stats. 
---
It doesn't solve the problem, but explains the difference between celestial runes and stats.
---
So, basically...the Kung Fu Tea fiasco all over again?
---
My biggest problem with Berserk is that I seem to get it just as something dies and then it's gone by the time I'd like it for a different group of enemies. That and the fact that it still has a long cooldown. I kind of wish that one of the grandmaster traits made it so that there was no cooldown to entering Berserk or drastically decreased it. Hopefully this was just an initial trial and ANet will modify things as they see people theorycraft
---
can i? brb, got to recover my core account.

1: The cash shop/gem store isn't pay to win.  It offers cosmetic items and convenience items.  The closest you can get to "pay to win" is by converting gems into in-game gold and then spending that gold on normal items in the Trading Post, but even that's not really "pay to win" as the strongest tier of equipment can't be bought on the Trading Post, requiring you to either level up crafting, spend a time-gated resources from login rewards, or do various types of content to earn.  You can buy the second-highest tier of equipment from the Trading Post, but the cost of that is so low that it's easily attainable without spending money, so again, not pay to win.
---
The currency conversion works the other way, too.  You can earn in-game gold and turn it into gems to buy the cash shop items without spending real money.  Doing that, the only things that you would need to spend real money on would be the expansions, you can't buy those by converting in-game gold.
---
Now, buying the game's expansions will give you certain perks.  Gliding, mounts, elite specializations, etc.  The free version of the game is essentially what the game launched as, and for extra max level content like those above perks, you need to buy expansions.
---
2: There's a lot of types of endgame.  There is no gear treadmill and the level cap will never increase, so the usual endgame you might be used to from other MMORPGs doesn't apply here.  New gear added in expansions/episodic releases offers combinations of statistics that weren't available before, new visual appearances, and the like, but isn't strictly more powerful than what has come before.  There are dungeons, fractals and raids to serve as instanced content for groups, and various open world events that encourage people to work together even outside the traditional group framework, as you've likely noticed.  Seeing other people in the open world isn't a bad thing, as there's no kill-stealing, harvesting nodes are shared, and everyone can participate in the same events.
---
PvP balance fluctuates.  If there is a class that's in a horrible spot now, or one that's good to a broken extent, then those things get addressed with balance patches each couple of months.  So no, the balance might not be perfect, but it's always evolving.  Advising you to avoid a certain class now might just mean that you're missing out on the strongest class after the next set of changes, we won't know.  Fortunately, PvP is very easy to get into.  Your level doesn't matter for PvP, your gear doesn't matter, everyone is on the same playing field.  If your chosen class winds up nerfed and you don't have fun playing it, you can create a new character with a different class, run through the tutorial instance in a few minutes, and then jump into PvP right away and try it out.
---
World vs. World (WvW) is a different style of PvP, pitting servers against each other in large-scale warfare.  There, your stats and gear do matter, though low-level characters are upscaled to level 80 while playing in it.
---
3: What not to like about the game?  WvW doesn't get the amount of attention it probably should from the developers, though that's something they're trying to address.  They have plans for it, but it's been quite a while without the plans being implemented.
---
Beyond that, a general problem the game has is having cool new systems implemented and then forgotten about.  Guild Missions came out years ago, offering a way for guilds to team up for various activities and earn a currency for special rewards.  And now, years later, new ones haven't been added, the system was never expanded upon.  It's still the same guild missions as when they launched.  Similarly, the Heart of Thorns expansion brought about guild halls as a place for players to hang out, decorate and level up.  It once again looked like an expandable system, but it's sat largely untouched since then, with only a handful of new things added since its release.  It sometimes seems that the game's devs are always moving on to the newest, shiny toy they're working on, which is often a very cool toy, but the ones they'd played with before are just left to sit untouched and forgotten.
---
The OP's context was, but the context from the above comments was for black lion keys, which is what i went off of. For the rest, i'm not endorsing or saying this was a good promo at all, but the marketing email was probably written by Alienware, even if distributed from the anet emails, the amount of keys purchased was determined by alienware, and the giveaway itself was run by alienware. It wasn't that ANet is stingy and didn't want to give away those keys, it's that there was a contract written for "in exchange for (number) of keys, we will give you (dollar amount) and advertising, that's where the limit is coming from. If it was anet's giveaway and they hosted all parts of it, i'd understand sayign it was dumb, but this is just a business issue exacerbated by alienware being underprepared for bots / demand

While running around in open world and not trying too hard, Rock Gazelle on my Viper Soulbeast. I just like that roundhouse kick animation. For the sake of Raids and Fractals I am almost always merged with my Fanged Iboga so I can spit on my enemies and shout in frustration (plus it's just really effective and gives access to a few more conditions)
---
There is literally nothing stopping anet from flipping a switch and letting anyone who participates in these things to get that damn outfit. The artificial scarcity they themselves introduced for this cosmetic is really frustrating.
---
Yes
---
I stopped caring for these promotions haha
---
I've actually been here, and it's incredible. The colors and views are amazing.
---
true that. that would be the way of doing it. But i was specifically talking about the limited amount of keys. Rather than how the promotion was presented.
---
Your other anti-spam suggestions are also good. I think arenanet are just using alienwares own standard giveaway procedure for simplicity though, as bad as that is.
---
There must be an API that can be hooked into for the giveaways to only allow one code to be given out per paid account.
---
There is nothing "cheesy" about that.  You still incur the cooldown for exiting zerk mode...
---
at least you tried.

A few days ago I saw a 70KP LFG for Qadim that had (no thief) added onto the end.
---
How you get that far and not learn that DD is the absolute best class for Qadim, I do not know. 
---
As for pugs though: no DH isn't the best class on VG. It's the best for hardcore groups because it can instantly delete the split phases. You -won't- be able to do that in pugs. Without that advantage DH no longer becomes the best class. 
---
When was the last time you pugged? Outside of Largos - dps variety is very much alive.
---
&gt;Homogenizing classes and making almost everyone play DPS is stupid and bad balancing.
---
This is a tired, incorrect, and strawman argument. Allowing classes to excel by such huge margins, such as Mirage over almost every other condi dps on most condi bosses - *is absolutely bad balancing*. Homogenizing unique buffs is a hurdle pretty much *literally every other raiding endgame MMO* has done. Homogenizing unique buffs won't homogenize DPS glasses, rotations won't be the same Guardian's virtues aren't suddenly going to become ranger's pets. 
---
If could bring any DPS class- because they're A DPS CLASS -  balance would be a lot better. But you can't, because classes like Mirage are effin' broken.
---
&gt;I hate these kinds of “promotions“. I’m supposed to sign up for some company that I don’t care about and give them my personal information for advertisements in return for some not-so-great reward.
---
To be fair it could be worse. There were a lot of posts about that Kung Fu Tea promotion and how anyone using Instagram to log into their app would get their account hijacked by some Russian spammer.
---
Happened to a fake-book account I made (my alt email account was filled with "login from a new location" and the instagram account filled with spam).

after a year in pvp ive seen like 3 holos in that time to kill themselfs that way...

How is that pronounced? Lol
---
As a little bit of positive news - isnt season 3 (and 2) on promotion at the moment? And season 4 episodes have been free each week for the past weeks - i dont know if the last one is still free, in case you havent grabbed it?
---
Anet's balance team simply doesn't know there is solo content. As far as they're concerned, pve = raids&amp;fractals.
---
For some reason this demotivator format made me think this was a GW1 image.
---
I’m avoiding any promotions after accounts got banned with the last thing they did. Already forgot the name of the company.

Woah, that's a lot of buttons for trash.

Alienware was a bucket list item. Finally bought one a few years back. 6 weeks with their horrible CS and then a replacement laptop that came with the same freaking flaw and I gave up. Alienware sucks ass.  It also left those deep tissue marks/burn on my thigh that took about 6 months to disappear. Overheated all the time and D drive would disappear randomly.
---
It's the Welsh  spelling of "Guinevere" , although it's pronounced slightly differently.

Just to be clear I haven't really spent that much time setting this up, just for the purpose of showing what GFE filters can do.

fair enough, just some way of bypassing the key requirement and putting it directly onto someones account.

Steam had that for a while but then presumably something went wrong and it was removed. My guess is that someone worked out how to put any game into any account and for some reason it couldn't be updated.
---
Ah, I'll have to check it out! Thanks!!

Yeah same with me, I registered and didn’t get a pop up so had to find some old account to register again, got a pop-up but nothing about the outfit :/

Poor Ice Troll probably has enough conditions for the entire day but dies after 20 seconds...
---
This is great news!  :)   But there's still some bitching in the comments.  To provide some clarity for those who don't already know, this has be explained ad nauseam in this subreddit many times, and repeatedly spelled out by ArenaNet staff on the forums.  The availability and provisioning of contests, giveaways, and gemstore items is a product of government laws and restrictions in the player's country - **not by favortism on ArenaNet's part.**
---
And To those who are *still* bitching about the Kung Fu Tea promo:  Seriously, you guys are going to be the people who turn 30 or 40 and still hate the grade school bully.  You need to grow up and get over it for your own good.  Yes - ArenaNet **mistakenly** offered the promo to everyone initially and had to backpedal and correct it - that's true.  And though it was a sloppy process that got people's expectations up, it was ultimately done correctly resulting in letting down a lot of players - also true.  But that doesn't obligate ArenaNet to break laws and risk getting into deep shit just to give you a costume for your video game character.  Do you even think before you complain, bro?
---
Good old times. This event was active when I started playing gw2. It was also the time where I got a Jade weapon skin from my 2nd killed mob during my first quest. I'd actually wish they would restore the original Lions Arch and this even even if it means time travelling
---
Thats what they apparently say in the details for it. It also says it takes up to 30 days "or more" to credit the account. My guess? It's wonky and in its beta stage and you're going to need to spend time with both alienware/Dell customer support to get it to work. Valuable time that isn't worth a 25 dollar coupon.
---
Why would you ever give them your real info? Your email, your name, your DOB, anything? There are dozens of services that provide you with temporary email accounts that are gone after a few minutes. Spam these promotions with names like John Doe, born 1970-01-01, using an email c6ks71@gy1p.ninja, and don't bother deleting, let them waste their hard drive bytes and cpu cycles on your pointless account that will never be used ever again.

I want to merge with a [bunny](https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2017314/rs_634x1024-170414125223-634.Playboy-Bunny-Amber-Heard-The-Playboy-Club.ms.041417.jpg).
---
I would take your toon into the PvP lobby to test out builds/potential playstyles on the golems. Since all stats are scaled up and all specs are unlocked, you can just pick up a bunch of the super cheap weapons and play around with them. In my experience, the best way to become familiar with a class is to A: level with them, or B: experiment with different weapons- read the tool tips, test animations, try out the combos, etc. You could always level a mesmer manually, or level one until you feel like you're more comfortable with it. Or, you could take your current toon into higher level maps in either core tyria or pof (I don't recommend taking it into HoT, that just seems like a bad idea, haha).
---
Mesmer rotations are not hard. Support chrono has been nerfed/changed to the point where it's basically a mindless loop. Once you get around to playing mesmer for a bit, it'll become a lot easier. Granted, while there are better classes to play in order to learn how to use more complicated rotations properly (as a stepping stone), there are far worse choices (like weaver). From experience, mesmer is still quite a forgiving class. If you run sw/shield and sw/sw, you basically have 3 blocks and lots of cc options even without any utilities. Shatter skill 4 grants distortion as well- basically a long invul., and sword 2 does massive damage as well as has a nice evade while being cast. I suggest first learning about your shatter skills- they're a core part of all mesmer builds/playstyles. Also get to know the functions of clones and illusions- super important!  You can either shatter them for damage/cc/invul, or use them to help tank bosses if you're doing a HoT HP solo, or say if you have a staff mirage, use staff 1's "ambush" skill with 3 clones for tons of damage (though it did get nerfed a while back, rip free pvp wins). Again, tons of options, and outside of group content it really honestly is up to you as to how you want to play.
---
With that being said, in open world, I personally prefer to run sw/sw and gs, with staff as a backup if I want to stay ranged for both weapon sets. Sw/shield also works great if you want a "tankier" option. Gs specifically does really good damage, has great range, and always feels great to pelt someone in the head with massive damage using gs 4. Gs is a safe option where you won't have to go into melee range to do damage, and is also quite easy to pick up, imo. Main hand sword is definitely a staple for most mesmer builds in general (outside of mirage, where it's just not as good as axe).
---
Mirage is pretty fun! It's a condi class- stacks of torment and the condis from staff are really good with tons of clones. There's a lot of emphasis on the "ambush" and "stealth assassin" aspect of it. There are a few builds on metabattle that are pretty good, especially for pvp (though due to nerfs, it's not as op). I suggest it look it up- it involves a lot of blinking around and is really good for chasing people down. Mirage excels at 1v1 duels and can absolutely shred condi raid bosses. If you manage your stamina bar properly you can basically have infinite evades. I don't play a ton of mirage outside of pvp but I personally do think it is slightly easier than chrono. If you're planning to learn chrono, learning to use continuum split is really important- bascially a reset button for skills cd. This is super useful if you're playing support as it allows you to keep using your wells/sigil of inspiration- this is how chronos can provide almost infinite quickness/alacrity. If you plan on learning support, sigil of inspiration is super important as it extends durations of boons around you for 3s. If you use it with mimic/cs properly, you can essentially use it 3 times- once in cs, use mimic, then you can use it twice more. Sadly it was nerfed a while back, but still is really good at providing boons.
---
The best way to learn mesmer, or even to counter mesmer, is to play it. There are some "easier" playstyles or builds, but it will never get easier if you don't actually take the time to learn them. Outside of t4 fractals and raids, no one's going to get mad if you're not doing rotations perfectly or doing max dps. Low level fractals are a great way to learn to practice your toons in group content (and I sincerely apologize to anyone who got stuck in my group while I learned to play weaver).
---
I dunno, sounds like heresy.
---
Dude ?!
---
The longest journeys begin with a single step
---
I'm with you there. I can't imagine having that many characters. 
---
I have 4 but only really play one of them.
---
Thief instead has a resource called Initiative that stacks up to 12 or 15 and regenerates at a base rate of 1 per second. Using weapon skills 2 to 5 spends initiative, but you can use the same skill repeatedly with no recharge.
---
As a DB player I appreciate our SEA/OCX people.
---
It sounds like that's a good thing though, what's the alternative?
---
Here we go again...
---
So you are suggesting they rush out the release instead of trying to get it as good as possible?
---
How are guilds a huge aspect of the gameplay? You don't need a guild for a single important thing in the game.
---
Iboga, even my stomachs acids are a weapon.
---
Every post about it pushes it back another week.  We are now looking at an early July release.   Thanks...
---
I have episode 4 and 5 of LS 4, last time I checked all other episodes are 200gems. I'll check again later though, thanks for the heads up.
---
You don't need a guild, but they make a lot of content far more accessible, especially for new players that are otherwise unaware of things that can be done.
---
Both of the options I'm referring to are in-game in the gem store redeem code option.
---
http://prntscr.com/ngvj30
---
You first click on Redeem code, and a window opens to enter a code but then below it says "Have a promo item code?" with a button below saying  "Redeem item code".
---
Try that option.
---
Only 5 kills? Seems low.  But with those stats it seems like you’re a side noder and got into some prolonged fights, which would explain the low kill count. If you got into those long fights while the enemy controlled the node I’d understand why he’s raging, but I don’t know the full story so won’t assume anything.
---
Sometimes no matter how hard you carry it isn’t enough. I usually view winning all top stats as my team being bad and unable to fight without me. Those games are the most frustrating, especially when you lose.
---
Yeah, I really feel the Rage skills should have been given a glyph skill style functionality with this change, in berserk mode extend the duration, out of beserk mode gain adrenaline or shorten berserk's cooldown. So it isn't just better to only use them while berserking
---
I could see that becoming a collection. You go to various places in Tyria collecting body parts from the Risen, Awakened, or yes, even Mordrem, and maybe just some animal or humanoid parts from random corpses and do what Zhaitan did. In the end you have an abomination that oozes tar or something of that sort. They could get really creative and out there with the design too.
---
That’s a cool idea. :)
---
Not for long it isn't.

Arc cannot delete your gear. It's literally impossible. It doesn't interface that deep, it literally only sends "equip item1" commands. Arc has never ever, not even once, deleted someone's gear.
---
Delta (the creator of Arc) just put a generic warning on his page, and people ran with it, and gossip slowly morphed "delta warned that arc might bug out" into "arc might bug and delete gear" into "people have gotten their gear deleted". It's never happened, it's just like the "telephone game" where you whisper a word into someone's ear, they whisper it to the next person, and at the end of a bunch of people, they think the original word was "banana" when it wasn't.
---
Hold up man, is that logic you are using?
---
You've made a great choice. Thief is the best profession in Guild Wars 2.
---
Man of culture, I see.
---
I think the thing is that BS loses no dps at all by clearing orbs as it can cleave them and gorse at the same time w longbow F1, unless theyre super far out in which case they don't really matter anyway. Unless youre doing updrafts, in which case youre not really optimizing dps anyway so yea, then you might as well do it on sb3 :p
---
Good point but to assume that rant only has one definition is to assume words can only mean one thing
---
I was bunker scrapper, all the damage/healing was done protecting and recapping points
---
And on your second paragraph, we were actually winning, when they started zerging on every point. My team didn't manage to answer probably.
---
OMG, that's one hella good lecture I have read! :)
---
Your explanations are on point, will definitely try everything tomorrow. 
---
And well, since I am not planning on playing harder end game content as raids and t4 fractals, you all shall not fear my chrono support! :D
---
&gt; if you cant take it you have no business on the internet
---
Except EVERYONE is on the internet now, unlike your "good ol' days". People haven't gotten softer, more people are standing up against any form of negativity. If you really can't play a game on the internet without trash talking strangers, maybe you have no longer have business on the internet?
---
I'd say if you can't take the response to your 'joke' then you don't need to be on the internet either.
---
I did a switcharoo as soon as I posted, the link should not have the names anymore
---
I wont get banned or suspended so the only real lesson is society continues to circle the drain with the new generation
---
Not really. It substantially underperforms when compared to other dps classes, although with the last balance patch now power berserker dps might become viable.
---
Condi berserker dps was a thing on some bosses before last patch, now it doesn't seem likely anymore.
---
Good old "It's just a joke" to cover for yourself being an ass. Almost as classic as being old so you have to make fun of kids to ignore the fact that death is approaching faster and faster.
---
Huh, then why did you instantly assume when they said they'd report you that you might get in trouble, seeing as words can have varying definitions depending on the source?
---
Extensive video game research! Thank him for his service.
---
But you knew the guildy was uncomfortable by them saying so right? So you took the right action. And if i was triggered id have responded back to him in anger but if u like i cam send u pics of the convo i dont get mad over ppl on the internet i just prefer to show my personal opinion since that is my right

Removing unique buffs isn't bad unless you seriously believe banners are what make Warrior interesting to play.

If you run axe, you almost always run axe mastery, and then you can land the decapitates with just three hits (2 and 4 count as two hits)

You have a lot of faith in pug chronos and yes you are obsessed with DPS or else you wouldn't care, dude.

I was lurking on reddit once and I saw people had speculated that theres basically many many items in GW2 hinted by the devs that have never been found, and they are presumably Mystic Forge stuff. So they would unlock if a person discovers said item, but of course nobody has found anything so far. Of course this could all be false, smoke and mirrors, but then you have to wonder particularly in the case of Lucky Rabbit's Foot why is there like 6 colors from that vendor alone, plus a white and a black one found elsewhere, if they have no use? I know one could say that its just extra flavor but those currency-eaters also give other kind of 'junk' as well. Sometimes they are just that, junk, but sometimes they have some sort of description too which corresponds to the vendor selling it.. idk, tinfoil hat on of course, its just fun to speculate lol
---
But yeah, you can actually combine those Lucky Rabbit Feet but nobody has found out with WHAT. And with that event being bugged the only way to get them is through the eaters and very very rarely. Just dumping 4 random colored Lucky Rabbit Feet doesn't discover anything new from what I've noticed.
---
Second time they've put out this outfit and second time that the codes were gone before I was even out of bed. Swing shift schedule shouldn't be screwing me quite that hard. If your codes run out before noon when you open a promo at 9am, there's somethin' weird with that.
---
Again, twisting my words. It doesnt make warrior interesting to play, it makes group comps interesting to theorize and not just stack BiS DPS.
---
This. It’s just a cosmetic item too.
---
Aww man I loved this event, I had no idea it was bugged.
---
Im not worries about being reported hes not the first to do so lol
---
Wrong, wrong, and nope. Soulbeast has stances - but how often do you see them? Unique buffs won't do shit unless said unique buffs are shit, and unique buffs are POISON to proper balance.
---
&gt; i just prefer to show my personal opinion since that is my right
---
So only your personal opinions are valid and those that aren't from "soft communities", Got it.
---
Something like this would be cool as hell, but I think looking for it to be built into the game is the wrong approach.  There are plenty of gaming mice (mouses?) and keyboards available with custom programming software that can handle this better than ArenaNet could.
---
Just imagine a Tuesday game update that  breaks the F1 keybind for all Mesmers, and they can't fix it until Friday.  I will go ahead and confess that I'd be cheering in PvP lobby!  But for everyone else this would be devastating.  UGH!  &gt;:O
---
Those interested may want to check out Logitech's line of... meese, particularly the [G600 MMO mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Backlit-Programmable-Buttons-910-002864/dp/B0086UK7IQ).  It has a third mouse button on the far right - the "G" key - that enables you to change the functionality of all the other buttons.  For example, let's say you have the 1 - 5 buttons on the side of the mouse bound to your F1 - F5 skills.  You could set it up so that when you press and hold the G key those 1 - 5 buttons instead correspond to 5 of your mounts.  Release the G key and you're back to your F-skills.  There are a lot of great possibilities.
---
The same is true for keyboards, though a nice gaming keyboard with single key customization is hella expensive, you can get a small macro pad for pretty cheap.  I have a [Logitech G13  keypad ](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G13-Programmable-Gameboard-Display/dp/B001NEK2GE)\- which I did ***not*** buy for $299 - that is great for this purpose.  You can get it  used for cheap on eBay.  I also have a [Max Falcon 8 keypad](http://www.maxkeyboard.com/max-falcon-8-custom-programmable-mini-macropad-mechanical-keyboard-assembled.html) that I use for mass copy-pasting at the office, but it's a pain in the ass to program.  Recently I've been looking at [Koolertron's keypad](https://www.amazon.com/Koolertron-Single-Handed-Programmable-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B076LRJ528) on Amazon as an upgrade.

Then I can almost assure you that Anet has their eye on you ;)

Nice, thanks for letting me know!

So because instead of being one of those people who fly into a blind rage and talk about the silly moments by ur definition i dont belong on the internet so in your eyes its better to be angry?

What's bloom?

My day is going fine, just find it weird you feel the need to point out a societal flaw because you got reported in an mmo.

the wiki has no mention of a possible use for them. i've had lots of bunny feet from eaters but i've always just discarded them.
---
Background: I've run one of the most successful PvE guilds with 500 members since the game's launch.  We've probably given away over 20,000g in prizes, cleared all the raid wings for gold statues, made apps to clear guild missions, have a calendar for events, Discord, etc.  I have since taken a backseat and allowed others to take the reigns.  Now I primarily WvW and have for several years.  I'm seeing what other guilds do and how they run and its a lot less loose than we are/were (guild is still around).  Most guilds do the very basic.  They will get a guild VOIP setup and most likely claim the guild hall and slowly upgrade it when funds trickle in.  After that, its generally the same thing in and out each week.  You're either a WvW guild or a PvE guild for the most part.  Its very hard to do both and keep players interested because generally speaking, most players will prefer one or the other.
---
Whoever has the most time, dedication, and leadership should start the guild.  Be careful about who gets officer/admin rights to the guild to help prevent abuse and such.  Know that being a guild leader of a guild with a good chunk of members will be demanding and the only payout you get will be the satisfaction of success.  You'll need to find something that everyone mostly enjoys and continue to do that while also introducing new ideas that brings the guild together and makes people want to stay around.  People look for something different.  If you just run guild missions once a week, you probably won't hold many people around.  However, if you have guild missions, decorators, a maxed guild hall, fun events like hide-n-seek, lotteries, giveaways, etc. then you'll have a much better retention rate.  Last thing, or maybe it should be near the top, is that you need to figure out how many people you want in the guild.  Do you want it to just be close friends and slowly let people in you enjoy that you find while you all play or would you rather mass recruit and have 500+.  That's something you'll want to talk over with your startup members.
---
Most guilds are centered around specific content. Fractals,dungeons,raids and such. Some guilds do daily meta events or HP runs or silverwaste farm etc etc. Others focus exclusively on WvW raids. But if you are a solo player or super casual and dont care about premade groups for instanced content then a guild will not offer anything. 
---
 
---
Yes u can join a random casual PvX guild to find a few friends to play with but usually it doesnt work unless everyone has the same mindset. That's why most popular and successful guilds have specific goals, recruit specific types of players so they can encourage their players to be social and active within the guild.
---
For example if you're a hardcore fractal player, like to min-max, like to run specific comps and builds a casual guild will offer nothing in terms doing that content as u will just end up using lfg to fill your squad.  If you're mostly into doing open world and join a guild that mostly does instanced content, again, you will just end up playing solo again or lfg.
---
So bare in mind, it is useful to first find what content you run the most when you log in, what content you like most and then search for a guild accordingly. Friends will just come naturally through playing the content.
---
Announcing you're doing something badly beforehand does not make it good.
---
For someone who is "way **too** old to care", you sure care a lot.
---
Oh honey...
---
Exactly. Only thing that's maybe worrying is that I don't see a way to get the branded weapons besides this? But I assume those will be a thing later.
---
I'm guessing there's some kind of catch? $25 free and clear for anything Dell sells? No minimum purchase? No limited selection? No expiration date? No exclusions?
---
I agree that two Chronos are enough to get good Slow uptimes (especially with TW). However, the numbers from the solo log you are claiming are somewhat misleading - both Dragonhunters contributed a bit (10-20%) and so did the Druid (5-10%). The support Chronomancer was at ~40%, without TW.
---
Also, Chronophantasma is likely to do better if you are using shield 4 than Lost Time. If anything, Delayed Reactions will be a better source of extra Slow at a minor damage loss for the support chronomancer.
---
If you are not sure about the capability of the support chronomancers, bring a Time Warp of your own - many do not actively use shield 4.
---
I care about the direction society is taking thanks for asking 😊
---
&gt; you can’t flirt with a girl cause it’s harassment or putting women down. Don’t you even dare smile.
---
That's bullshit. If you're not a creep, nobody will be calling your flirting harassment. Women are just fed up with constantly getting actually (sexually) harassed and men calling it "flirting" and then being suprised when women tell them to fuck off.
---
2. I spend my end game doing random achievements, messing about with friends doing PvP WvW etc, grinding legendary too but I'm a poor player... Thanks Obama
---
3. I don't like how fast it is to level up masteries in the new expansion. HoT had masteries that took a very long time, and so does Tyria and it felt awesome getting them, PoF feels like I can get any of them within an hour. Maybe I am just a grind player but ye
---
As response to your edit
---
1. A lot of people buy the salvage kits and the gathering tools for convenience. As well as bag space and bank and deposit space. I have none of those and game is still fine so up to you if you wanna throw the $5
---
2. Expansions give you access to class upgrades, maps, new movements systems gliding for HoT and mounts for PoF. Also have raids and guild halls associated with them.
---
3. IMO buy them when you reach level 80 as that's when levelling masteries becomes relevant, there really isn't anything that you are missing out on as the areas are all level 80 anyway.
---
4. Personally I like playing with the "Action Camera" makes the game smoother for me and makes jumping puzzles easier, apart from that I run arcdps for the dps meter and that my only real UI change
---
Why would you say homophabia is happy?? 
---
WTF is wrong with you?
---
Love me some drizzt
---
As far as fractals, I sigh when a power chronos joins my CM groups. They can do dps, sure, but it’s bad. But is that a problem, I don’t think so. You don’t really see most druids complain about not being able to do good dps, the spec just isn’t meant to dps. Similarly, chrono has never been and isn’t a spec you take for dps. 
---
People who complain about dps, and rightfully so, are more often specs that are like zerker warrior or necro that are meant to dps, but don’t bring good numbers to compete very well.
---
&gt; Anet should add 500 activities to guilds like ...
---
Actually guild missions that trained for mechanics and raids/fractals would be super cool
---
can't you get the branded weapons via the rift events?
---
while what others said is mostly true, the guild itself with boons, buffs and guildhall / missions (so the functions itself) become kinda a wasteland since you are not going to use that much after a while if you are not super into decorating.  
---
so in the end, most guilds at this point are extended friendlists for likeminded people or "trash" massguilds with lil groups inside the guild which will do smt together.
---
Lynx for condi and Rock Gazelle for power. I look at pets more like a tools than anything so yea, why would I take bad pet over a good one.
---
Dad get off the internet you are too old for this
---
I'll go by my own personal and obviously-biased example (because I haven't seen many people discuss Celestial let alone recommend it, heck I've been told not to use it on several occasions), but I play a Staff Weaver Roaming/Zerg Hybrid in WvW that makes use of Celestial in all armor slots. Now that isn't much Toughness, Healing Power, nor Vitality...30 points here, 67 there, another 22 here...but compared to an enemy Staff Weaver going a mix of Berserker and Marauder (and leaning more towards Berserker in that to kill the enemy quickly), I end up not only having that added Toughness they don't which mitigates damage, but better Barrier due to Healing Power, better Condition tick damage, and I'm only losing a little of that straightforward burst.
---
Considering most similar Weavers run Mist Form or Twist of Fate and the like (myself included) to dodge exceptionally hard-hitting attacks, enemy Weaver burst is mostly meaningless to me. I either dodge their most dangerous spells, or soak the less-dangerous ones through higher Barrier values and Toughness, and all the while any damage they do get on me doesn't stick because my Healing Power keeps me topped off. Meanwhile they're succumbing to the burns and bleeds I pelt them with even if they dodge a few higher impact spells.
---
I've watched Zerg Staff Weavers get quickly taken out/almost instantly downed by the current Longbow Soulbeast meta because they have zero damage mitigation, but I haven't had too much difficulty going toe-to-toe with most Soulbeasts and in fact tend to pursue engagements with them.
---
I provide myself with Swiftness/Superspeed, Regen, and Barrier in heavy doses, and apply Chill, Cripple, Bleed, Burn, and Blind in equal doses. If they want to provide me that added Concentration and Expertise and improve the duration of the myriad effects the Weaver possesses at no cost to my current sustain, I won't turn it down, but I do think it would be more balanced to take at least a few points from the other totals before doing so.
---
Not many classes can utilize it to full extent, at least not as good as elementalists and guardians. Personally I would love to see D/D tempest with celestial in PvP.
---
Well, get to digging, then.
---
So the missing professions are Warrior, Guardian, Elementalist, and Mesmer? Based on that, I'd suggest Guardian. Guardian is a personal favorite due to its trait lines and weapon variety. Greatsword is one of its better weapons, like Reaper and Ranger, and when you get to Dragonhunter it can use a Longbow; I've heard mixed things about the Longbow but for PvE I still find it is a decent ranged option.
---
Of the other three, I personally find Warrior a bit meh but the reworked Berserker spec is more fun to play. But for 1-endgame you'd spend quite a while with the core profession so Warrior would not be my choice. The Scholars, Ele and Mes, can both be great if you want something a bit more involved and less resilient. Depending on your Necro builds, there might be some similarity, but they generally aren't as defensive as Necro and pretty different in weapons for the most part.
---
Overall, I would say Guardian is probably the closest to your current favorites while still being pretty unique. Also, in a way it is kinda the inverse of Necro since Necro is high health and low armor while Guardian is low health and high armor. Ele or Mes would be my second pick, but I'd save them for the next character slot.
---
I almost feel bad for people who post stuff like that because aging is admittedly kind of scary. Life goes into overdrive because the older you are the less time a year feels like as a fraction. 1/10th vs 1/45th.

They don't bother me too much because I feel their attacks are better telegraphed. It seems to me like the Vet. Ice Troll AoE freeze doesn't go off when the red ring ends. Sometimes it seems to go off before the red ring dissipates, sometimes a full second after, so dodging it is a nuisance for my melee characters.
---
&gt; there really isn't anything that you are missing out on

except for the Revenant profession, right?

YOUR reasoning makes no sense
---
What? Because I disagree I obviously care about the DPS? What kind of nonsense logic is this? "You disagree with the earth being flat, therefore you care that the earth is flat?"
---
Thank you for proving my point 😊
---
This took a dour turn but I can't disagree. I'm only 25 and the years feel like they are "speeding up." I need to travel more and get new experiences, it helps to reduce that feeling I've been told.
---
Potential arsonist, another check mark.
---
Not potential 😜
---
Kind of a new player here, but I've taken a liking to my Red Moa. The vulnerability + impact is really fun in PvE.
---
Next mount: Dredge.
---
Oh yeah, I've seen one or two in my many runs that will sit and wait for you to draw agg before they run in, grab berries, and ditch. And when I see that type I often wonder how much time they waste in purposefully avoiding conflict/watching from a "safe spot" instead of just lending a hand as they go so everyone can move on?
---
But I digress, the agg range on those Ice Elementals is pretty crazy. It reminds me of the agg range of White Mantle in Bloodstone Fen, actually. And then you have the spiders that don't drop exp or unbound magic or items at all, and while the little ones are easy enough, the Veteran one has *way* too much health than is necessary when it can't even drop items. All in all as good a farm as Bitterfrost is, the enemies there are just annoying.

Stealth attacks replace your 1 skill while stealthed. They made it so it has a short recharge if you miss a stealth attack, so be careful!

The only thing I don't like about it is when you unmerge (which you usually don't have to do) the stupid animal goes for the charge and ends up like 50 miles away.

Can companies do it? Sure. But they'll get fined to death if they get caught doing it, which makes it much more likely that they wont. Giant companies like FB can handle fucking up compliance, but smaller (on a relative scale to FB) companies like Dell would hurt BAD if they lost 4% of their global revenue.

Come back after you've sent as many people as I have to ~~hell~~ I mean the shadow realm.
---
A bit jumpy to conclusions, are we?
---
Make new Statset, call it Cosmic, add concentration &amp; expertise, round down numbers. Success?
---
There's pretty much zero reason to start a new guild nowadays.
---
The only reason to do it is for communication (which 3rd party apps like discord already excel at), or if you feel like spending thousands of  US dollars on a guild hall that nobody will use.
---
If you're looking for change, challenge, and versatility, check out ele and mesmer.
---
With ele you're going to be very fragile, but you're a Swiss army knife of magic, depending on your traits and weapons. If you're staying ranged, staff ele is the queen of ranged AoE that sees enhancement without changing the play style too much with the tempest elite. Up close, sword/dagger weaver is scary single target dps.
---
Then there's mesmer. Some people say leveling a mesmer is awful but it was one of my more enjoyable leveling experiences. YMMV
---
Mesmer has weapon swap so you can have a few sets. With this one, greatsword is your primary range option, while up close, it's sword main hand with a variety of off hand options. It's a fun play style that revolves around shatter mechanics: using weapon and utility skills to create clone and phantasm copies of yourself that carry out attacks...then using shatter skills that destroy those clones for damage and other effects that scale with the number of clones you shatter. It's a nice, fairly safe leveling class that really blooms with potential late game.
---
After level 80, you gain access to the chrono and mirage elites which can drastically change the class in very different ways.
---
Mesmer is one of the few classes that I've made multiple alts just to have a character in two very different roles at the same time.
---
Then find a buddy too?
---
There are already traits that affect how might affects you, as well as the fury effectiveness trait. Likewise there's ways to augment protection for some classes.
---
 think more traits like that would be excellent.
---
There is also a sigil that is supposed to increase "all" stats per stack (per kill), but it wasn't updated when the runes were - and despite similar descriptions these two now work differently. Which is sad, because I am using it on my PvE jack-of-all-trades Holo.
---
Fairly certain napkin math brought med/low uptime of slow trait to still be more dps than the alac trait. But power chrono will still be good enough; if you don't have good slow uptime for your power chronos, you're likely not in a group that expects 100th percentile dps numbers.
---
The reason the Branded destroyed the tunnel leading to Elona is because it's cheaper to add one excuse line to an NPC than to plan ahead and create narratively interconnected environments while half their staff is working on irrelevant projects.
---
Unless you feel like no longer being part of this community, stop this shit right now.
---
I love the wink here: "I'm here to warn travelers against trying to force their way into the tunnel. **Yes, people have tried. No, it didn't work.**". Anyone remembers void jumping in Fields of Ruin and trying to get to that tunnel on the Ebonhawke's side? Yes, we have tried. No, it didn't work :(
---
To be fair, I AM a 90s kid xD.  But honestly, it's a good idea to hold on to it.  Doxing is a major issue with Twitch streamers, and minor details about a person can be found pretty easily thanks to social media.  My only saving grace is the fact that I have a super common name.  But you should still be careful while being online.
---
I can back that statement entirely.
---
Especially in Groups with shitty quickness or alacrity uptime you inflate your damage significantly.

Also the dragged out burst from your phantasms is killing quick bossphases!

The cosplays are amazing! I really liked dexter dee dee and the daisy duck ones.

I'll take your word for it
---
Holy shit what year is it
---
The big guilds are probably best either as a way to coordinate WvW teams, host large events, or to find smaller groups, possibly as a replacement for LFG pugs. You can definitely make being in a big guild work socially, but it takes finding a subset of people in the guild you mesh with, which is much easier in medium and small guilds.
---
Edit questions
---
1) copper fed salvage o matic is the biggest thing. You won't get more utility out of any other purchase
---
Also, living world episodes, those are the story elements, and include new maps and content (especially seasons 3 and 4) that take place between expansions
---
2) mounts, glider, masteries, elite specs, raids, expansion maps, revenant profession
---
3) whenever you're ready. The bulk of content is level 80 but you can get the mount ahead of time if you have Path of Fire and it makes movement easier
---
4) Under keybindings, there's an option to set a key to toggle action cam. When pressed, it turns your camera into an action rpg/shooter style camera, so your camera follows your mouse without right clicking. Not a huge fan but some people like it

---
Well that's one way of looking at things. As someone who is at the moment interested in instanced content I see things the other way around, for me GW2 is the trimmed down and streamlined game (gameplay-wise and in terms of QoL features), with all its instanced content being at this point for me ridiculously easy (aside from &lt;5 low mans and even then it's just a few bosses), while FFXIV is the one that offers some challenge, even if rather scripted. 
---
I assume you mean build crafting though and yes, obviously FF basically doesn't have that in the slightest, which has both its upsides (tight balance vs GW2's excessive jank) and downsides (theorycrafting low mans or weird PvP builds can be rather fun). Overall the more I play FF the more Im amazed at how good it is at what GW2 lacks and how much it sucks at what GW2 does well, they really complement each other :D

I had the same thing happen to me and the GM was completely clueless, didn't know black lion kits existed and argued that even if it was salvageable there wasnt a 100% chance I could get it back. I had to REALLY push them till I got a different GM and got my upgrade back, so good luck.

Thanks for putting these all together! I'm always amazed at what people are capable of O_O
---
Yeah Bloodstone Fen being *right there* on top of Verdant Brink but without any ability to path to it is frustrating, as is Thunderhead sort of floating away from other maps. I wouldn't even mind Asura Gates like what they did for Southsun Cove if that's what it'd take
---
Great work. I bet a lot effort was used. Keep it up :).
---
ALWAYS ANGRY
---
ALL THE TIME
---
&gt; Are you sure it's "Action Camera"? I see Free Camera, but not Action Camera.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Action_Camera_Mode_options_menu.jpg
---
should be below free camera
---
&gt; How earlier can I get a mount with PoF?
---
First chapter, so within the first 15 minutes. It is a level 80 instance though so you'll probably want someone to help you through it
---
&gt; What's Revenant like? I see "blindfolded warrior" and that sounds rad, but is it like blood magic or what?
---
Think shaman with swords. Aesthetically, revenant channels the spirits of dead powerful legendary figures from history, and changes its fighting style depending on what spirit its channeling. Gameplay wise, revenant is unique because of two primary features
---
1) An energy meter. Pretty much every skill requires the use of energy, and energy just recharges over time. The trade off is that it has many skills without cooldowns, and it has a set of toggled skills that you can have active as long as you have energy.
---
2) 2 preset sets of utility skills. Unlike most classes which can choose their 6-10 skills, revenant chooses 2 legends out of the set of 4-5 (depending on if you have an elite spec unlocked). You can swap them out at anytime outside of combat, but during combat, you can switch between the 2 legends that you've chosen to be your active legend. Each legend brings its own preset of utility skills, so you get a total of 10 utility skills at a time, but you only get to choose them in blocks of 5.
---
Also, the energy meter is dependent on the legend you're channeling, so if you run out of energy on one legend, you swap to the other and you're charged up to 50% again
---
He's a good DRK lol. But really I've had the chance the shoot the shit with him on a couple of discord servers. He's a funny dude.
---
My post was in reply to your bit about it being a literal waste of money.  It technically isn't.  It's about supporting the servers and company.
---
yes, and I may have acquired the item in Menzoberranzan.
---
Gonna go with condition minion Necro with a scepter. Switch to Scourge when you can. Your minions keep things busy, you stay at range, you get a trait to heal yourself via the condition damage that you deal, and you're quite tanky.
---
Just play reaper. A build with the least required input is afk 5 minion army with. Death magic, blood magic, reaper. You. Can't. Die.
---
I really envy you for you can find support to solve this problem, but in China we're not. I always see newbies from Chima community accidentally put thier chak egg sac or something like this into it and find it impossible to distract. Hope anet can fix this in game, not from support.
---
Open world, smokescale because the extra attack makes taking out the trash mob even breezier.  
---
For certain hero points I like the electric wyvern.  
---
Underwater is the jungle stalker.  
---
For teq and shat my blue moa.
---
Once in a while I'll run my lynx. No real reason. I named him Zelda and the name makes me smile.  
---
I fell into the mistake of taking the names seriously and now I feel guilty when I go too long without using my named pets.
---
Have you considered reaper (necromancer)? Tied for highest health pool, secondary life bar (shroud), primarily melee combat, minions to tank for you as well, might be something you'd enjoy
---
iirc, they didn't care as much about the fractal. Evon offered discounts on Black Lion keys, and Kiel offered discounts on waypoint costs. Given this was back when world boss farming was *the* endgame, people seemed to favor it.
---
Also I remember people arguing that she's the """good""" choice, canonically.
---
Which is ironic because, from what I remember, I think a dev alluded to the idea that, had Evon won, he would have made Lion's Arch much more militarily prepared to defend itself against Scarlet, which may have given us a different outcome in the attack.
---
I dunno, that whole idea of what they had theoretically planned is fascinating to me. Too bad we can't explore that alternate timeline at all, Abaddon fractal and everything.
---
Ty mate &lt;3 You and i (no doubt) are equally dedicated; i just invest my dedication differently. :) ty for your post.
---
Yoda wins:-D
---
That, my friend is hard thing to explain .-.
---
Too much salt from pvp I guess. The price of obtaining Ascension.
---
Well that's -10 sec of my life
---
Tybalt, introduction!
---
Yes, commander

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.

---
It's possible his friend has data limits. GW2 is a 50GB download.
---
Thread removed: Begging is not allowed.
---
Y'all are playing soulbeast wrong if you just suck up your pet. Its about becoming closer with your pet. Merge and unmerge all the time!
---
I recommend against boosting your first character. Playing the game one level at a time will give you time to thoroughly learn your class mechanics, whereas boosting will dump you at lv80 with a bunch of skills that you have no idea how they work together.
---
It is hilarious how both BBGs are purple and ridiculously OP.
---
I watched Endgame so now we'll have to see what similarities there end up being between the two! (desperate to make guesses but want to avoid spoilers)
---
I'm glad your friend is interested, but if he's really so lazy that he can't be bothered to just download the game client, and instead expects you to jump through hoops to transfer your own files to him, I have to question whether he'll be the type of person that you'll enjoy playing with once he's in-game. (Assuming he isn't too lazy to create a character and take it through the intro instance, that is.)
---
Hope it works out for you!
---
Nope. No one else like you.
---
Well yeah in pvp/WvW for sure. Raid meta is "suck up those sweet extra stats and 40% extra dmg from sic 'em!"
---
[HERE YOU GO, EMPEROR-BLESSED CITIZEN OF THE HOLY IMPERIUM OF MAN.](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Angry_Marines). NOW GO KICK SOME GENESTEALER IN THE BALLS OR SOMETHING
---
But it is not free though. They charge us, not by monetary but by something far far more valuable, personal information.... they should be paying us actual money to give them personal info and the GW2 loot should be just an extra on top of the cash value given to us...
---
It is scary how people do not value their own personal information and don't have much issue giving it away to whomever asks... :(
---
Yeah I wasn't talking from a meta perspective. But that also doesn't care about classes "feeling right" anyways.
---
Just let me point my Elementalist at it. I didn't spend all this time training with Earth magic for nothing.
---
Might wanna check out the ducks while you're at it.
---
SharkTwain#0895 on Discord, I'm part of a very small (but very friendly) guild that's always ready to help out, especially new players. We're most active around 6pm-10pm CST, but we hang out in Discord chat all day while we're at work. Don't ever hesitate to ask for help, we love to roll in and lend a hand when we're around.
---
I'm going to have to look into this build.
---
This promotion had a limit and the limit is reached. Thats it.
---
&gt;Slow uptime between 60 and 90% completely on my own
---
You mean between 25 and 40% on your own? Cause the rest is from other party members.
---
&gt; All you need is chronos using shield 4
---
I'm not saying you can't get full slow uptime in a random comp, what I'm saying is that the statement "all you need is chronos using shield 4" is wrong.
---
Good to know.  Fits a bit more than giving Guardians it, save for making their barriers potentially look more like holograms aesthetically.  Though I think steampunk is a little more my style as a whole.  Then again, I'll probably not make an Asura if it doesn't focus on hologram stuff.
---
Decisions.
---
Though ultimately, I tend to switch races whenever I pick the small ones.  They can be cute and such, but when that novelty ends, I'm stuck with what is essentially a scholastically arrogant and racist smallfry that calls others Bookah.  xD
---
I like how you mention chak egg sac as if its a very common occurrence lol Is it really? Because here I have only seen 1 or 2 pinged in chat in all my years and most are sold privately.
---
This wasn't "teasing" or "trolling". A limited number of legitimate codes were already given away. I don't support the decision to have such a small supply, though.
---
Stewie will haunt my nightmares for years to come.
---
it's been 2 days. The classes that weren't radically patched (sword weaver, deadeye, holosmith) aren't going to change, but other than that it will take a bit of time to benchmark everything.
---
pBerserker is getting about 30K, but apparently it just feels clunky to play smoothly
---
it resets on every fucking update, good luck. hat that shit already.  
---
sometimes even just on restart.
---
Agree.  Anyone know the gear/outfit?
---
Since when doesn't the powerful time manipulating chrono simply sharing boons around the clock feel right? Or the mighty warrior waving his banners like he's on an parade? /s
---
But what if I  really am always angry? They are denying my existence!
---
Thank you so much! I’m still learning how builds work in this game so this is IMMENSLY helpful!
---
Probably the same day they fix Druids Glyph of Equality in CA.
---
Is Riba and chest farm still worth it if you don't have a level 49 character compared to other farming methods? People always tell me to farm SW for gold but then I always see that its about opening the bags for lower tier materials.
---
Worth but with less income, what are we comparing to - time spent on doing different things?
---
When it comes to promotions, optics, and PR, what matters isn't what things are, but what things feel like.
---
What armor is that?
---
What a nice version, definitely my favourite SAB tune!
---
LOL reporting people on reddit
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
To funny
---
Well you can see [this chart](https://silverwastes.loltools.net/) for a comparison of the material values.
---
It is called subreddit and not reddit lol.
---
Yeah, you're right, it has nothing to do with you posting in any other sub.
---
But just like you assumed I follow MSM, I assumed you're an illiterate troll based on that sub. Touche.
---
Anyway bye, I don't have time to waste talking to a troll, on a post which is not even on any sub and just on profile.
---
just following your lead
---
DM me
---
I was just about to post that lol
---
I assumed you were some chick making phallus references and trying to pick up doods online....didn't know you hated homosexuals.
---
No need to go all Westboro on me....good lord the hate is real
---
just link one where you cant log into pvp on a daredevil, otherwise assume its working fine
---
One of the best skills in the game. Why take 5 fights when you can turn it into one? Pull, gs4 for blinding, spin and kill.
---
im just talking about daredevil balance
---
That is okay for a stop gap solution. Pretty poor for the long term.
---
Love this. The variety of skin options that offers a clear ball/bubble with any mob inside is huge.
---
I remember trying to make exactly that with a druid, and again with slb, but it just doesn't seem to work right. There's some control with dazes and druid, and pet/beast abilities in slb, but those are closer to extras and not the focus. Which kinda sucks, I like playing tanks and bruisers (I just like having an animal companion more). 
---
Maybe with the taunts, you get bonuses, like increased damage or the taunted has decreased. A bit generic maybe, but there's some feeling of working together at least. 
---
Also they have cats that can swim underwater, like the snow leopard and tiger. And if it gained elemental water properties, why doesn't it heal when merged? Water has a very strong theme of being the healing element in this game, not control. Even the new druid elite has falling rain while in CA.
---
Huh... I was told it was named Guild Wars after the Guild Wars theme by in GW1's Alpha testing.  The reason being that most games had project code-names until they knew for sure what it will be about, and then appropriately name it thereafter if the title isn't taken.  If it is, then it becomes a situation where the new Title may alter the lore such as what we got with Anthem.  Which originally didn't have an Anthem or anything of the sort in the game, but their first choice was taken up by someone else.  But that isn't a good example, since there is a good amount of evidence that that entire project was mismanaged.
---
Even the cinematic -- which takes a very long time to make -- had the Guild Wars in it.  With main characters such a Devona, whose father also fought in a Guild War.
---
Didn't understand this till I looked at OP's rather, controversial, post history. You definitely don't deserve the down votes here :s
---
Ohh I just thought there would be some changes but it is good enough to know that everything hasn't changed much at the power dps classes.  
---
Can you rank em? Like from highest to lowest DPS output?
---
Ty for the answer.
---
I never said anything else. I just explained why these codes are "out of stock". 
---
But whatever, feel free to continue my comments. Seems like you don't like explanations. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Buying anything from alienware is a waste tbh.
---
Youve picked the two most bullshit classes, congrats. You can become a perma-invisible unkillable bastard with the thiefs deadeye, or pick up reaper necro and steamroll everything with condi damage. Its really dealers choice which cancer youd like to be
---
Me posting to, reading, and not subscribing to a certain reddit (less typing though prolly easier to just type sub....I think i'll do that from now on thx!) doesn't make me a troll.
---
Understanding that to get the TRUE news in today's world you need to read it all is something you aren't demonstrating. If you truly did that you wouldn't be frothing at the mouth screaming troll or caring which sub (see what i did there) someone visits. 
---
Now since I pulled your card I see you are trying to claim you don't have time even though you already tracked this thread to my profile to type your stupid bullshit.
---
Enjoy your Soy Latte
---
It's on sale only for 10 dollars.
---
I'd absolutely love this ngl
---
An Inquisitor should be dispatched to Anet headquarters, we maybe witnessing some Heresy at play. The Emperor protects.
---
And you don't seem to like discussion? No need to get all worked up because someone replies to youe comment with their 2 cents.
---
&gt; The other two
---
You mean shattering blow the strong condi + stab + block + reflect skill and wild blow a really strong CC that launches (=&gt; affects downed players), can hit multiple targets and gives you furry? There are 4 others apart from Headbutt and Sundering Leap btw. Blood Reckoning is probably the highest DPS increase for a heal skill in the game and Outrage is the stun break of the set.
---
If you're not using a decent monitor for gaming, you're doing your eyes a disservice regardless.
