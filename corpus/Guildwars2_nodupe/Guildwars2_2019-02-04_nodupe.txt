yeah nah I wouldn't say that guild missions and dungeons are what makes gw2 great...
---
you're just clinging to 2012 gw2 
---

---
How are they adding grinding ?
---
And yeah they're adding items to a very fair gemstore that's allow them to stay subscription-free.
---
---
---
Since everyone is talking about Condi Soulbeast, I'll talk about Power Soulbeast, which isn't as good but cheaper to gear up. Longbow with the Marksmanship trait "Lead the Wind" causes your attacks to piece up to 5 targets, making tagging easier. You have skill #5, though it has a looooooong cooldown, so your best bet is to take that trait and position yourself well. 
---
Axe has a built in bounce on the auto, and the #2 is a cone attack. Some utility skills can deal damage, taking those counts as tagging. Using the right pet too can help, especially since SB gets extra skills thanks to them. 
---
It's really just an entire new style of play to learn. If you run a Fresh Air build, it becomes a lot easier to pull skills forward in an emergency. In general, though, compared to Tempest, you do have to be more fluid with your skills and with kiting/dodging/escaping certain enemies as needed.
---
The main hard part, though, is the double-tapping, yes. A lot of it is learning how to improvise and understanding what each skill does and how the attunements flow. For me, what helped the most was researching the builds and rotations to understand skills, and practicing on the golem to improve speed (as well as a new mouse haha). There's really not much more advice beyond practice and patience that I can give, and I can totally understand why so many still don't like it.
---
As for what I've learned to enjoy, it's really just something about the high-ceiling/low-floor that's really fun. Not worrying about death and being willing to challenge your limits helps. Weaver is Ele's ability to pull off insane things turned up to 10. It doesn't have the sustain of Tempest but that's really just another challenge, and the tradeoff I feel is 100% worth it compared to Tempest which (in retrospect) just feels like upgraded base Ele now.
---
I guess it depends on whether or not you want to think better of Logan or not. If he was under a spell or a charm, his actions are more justified, but if he was simply a lovestruck fool, his actions doomed his friends and possibly the whole continent. 
---
Because they were promised more. Particularly legendaries. It's like endgame players assumed the grinding of a host of new legendaries would be the fun part of HoT. But, we got Dragon's Stand instead, the grandest map meta to date. Bonkers planning decision, but I wouldn't wish it any other way.
---
Dragonsblood weapons are pretty grindy as a thing that they've added lately. 
---
Cant you be cute and a weaboo? 😻 
---
I've done CoF P1 dozens of times, maybe hundreds with pugs since dungeons were mercilessly slaughtered and not once has every single person understood to stand next to the braziers.
---
There's always one, usually more people who don't do it even when it's explained to them.
---
I keep thinking, we've got to run out of people who don't know what to do eventually. The influx of people trying out CoF for the first time can't be *that* high.
---
Or maybe they're just trolling with 2014 memes. I don't know, but I can't stop searching for a perfect pug. Please: *Send help.*
---
Going into earth is the best way to generate might though with 3 blast finishers 2/4/5.  Also while fire/air is the strongest damage, you lose out not utilizing fire/earth or air/earth 3 while fire/air 3 is on cooldown.
---
If you guys really want to see wind effects, go into  Dierdre's Steps(aka hidden garden puzzle) in Mount Maelstrom and go up into the cliffs area of the puzzle. Super wind effects as you go high up in the sky along the cliffs.
---
For context, this crash occurs every time I follow the steps in the video.
---
Nope, did not do this.

Yeah I think you're right that was anets idea, but that wasn't necessarily what the community expected.  The gen 2.5 system is by far better imo.

Jewels are this story's artificial mechanic for prolonging the grind.

There's a minuscule chance you get one after big meta, but you should get ~3 after opening the hidden chest in last room (hoard).

In order to do that you have to either buy the plate off TP, or finish both metas, and hope to fucking god that the plate sequence doesn't bug the fuck out.

I just started playing GW2 (F2P) and was wondering if any of the core classes are still viable or will I be outclassed by the DLC skills?
---
I was looking to play as either the Mesmer, Elementalist, or Necromancer. 
---
Which of these 3 classes would you recommend for a F2P player? I may eventually purchase the DLC down the line but I want to see if I’m going to enjoy this game or not. 
---
I like all content   PvP/PvE   Solo/Party and just want to make sure I’m choosing a class that is somewhat viable as its core class without having access to the DLC skill trees. 
---
Thanks for the help! 
---
There's only wrong turns in Tangled Depths, one does not simply find the right turn there.

Ok gotcha, I misunderstood your first comment.

@\_@ I feel bad now that it was spat out in my second chest with a key I had gotten from just farming. I wasn't even expressively wanting said shoulders. My luck always seems to give me things I don't want or had a passing thought on.

Is this hard to get? I have never played the game but am looking for a new mmo to start 
---
He was also an ex-God when Vlast died, tho.
---
Like, *ohmygod*, I think ANet thought that gen1 legendaries were too easy to get, and like it wasn't that prestigious, or *whatever*.
---
So they like, made sure you'd have to work at least somewhat for those, and not just buy them off TP.
---
Also basically the reason why the Human Gods went "welp, no fighting dragons or Balthy for us boys" now, since they have that shining example of how fucked Tyria would be if they did.
---
Have an upvote I hope it fills the void where the shoulders should have been Q-Q
---
[Per my other post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/amr1zd/its_all_logans_fault/efodnp8/?st=jrpm9kb1&amp;sh=47da6038) I don't think Logan's staying would have improved things at all.
---
TL;DR
---
* Jennah dies. Kralkatorrik dies. Zhaitan gets Kralkatorrik's magic (closest dragon). Caudecus takes throne; Kryta wages war against charr and doesn't assist Pact, Charr too occupied to assist Pact; no tanks, submarines, choppers, or airships for Pact. No killing Zhaitan, who proceeds to strike at LA and the Order HQs again, being far more effective since their forces are drastically weakened, and then marches on Kryta and the Tarnished Coast.
---
* Jennah lives. Kralkatorrik dies. Zhaitan gets Kralkatorrik's magic. Things go as they did, more or less, but no divided DE to reunite. We kill Zhaitan, maybe. If we kill Zhaitan, we move on to Mordremoth, we kill Mordremoth. Three Elder Dragons dead = world dead, before we even learn that we need replacements.
---
The only way to avoid such scenarios would be to bring Vlast into play, to either keep Glint alive against Kralkatorrik or to join the Pact against Zhaitan instead of hunting down Branded in vengeance.
---
Without a change in Vlast's actions, what Logan did was quite easily the best case scenario.
---
So if anyone screwed things up for us, prior to the events of PoF at least, then it was Glint, for sending her forces (Forgotten, Exalted, Facets, and Vlast) away from her lair as Kralkatorrik woke.
---
I really wish they would balance dungeons so they’d scale for single players. 
---
I beg to differ - ANet reacts to potential drama faster than they do to reports on forums, and reddit is pretty much *the* drama central (usual suspects stepped down - twitter is more of a shit flinging contest, and tumblr is being explicitly ignored after they got ousted as a den of child rapists).
---
Making enough a stink here will work wonders.
---
You realise that ANet and NCSoft are not the same company, right?  ANet didn't close down anything,  ANet still runs the only two games they have ever released.  NCSoft is the parent company that published GW1 and GW2, and City of Heroes... NCSoft shut down CoH and ANet never had anything to do with it.

Take this in all your berserker trinkets. You can also put them in armor and weapons but runes and sigils are usually better.

55 keys, no shoulders. Sad

I'm part of a guild and we do guild missions 4 days a week out in the open.

so far spent 750g on keys and didnt drop yet :) i wonder if i will reach my record of 2k spent for phantom glider or 1200g spent for magic backpack

my average ping is ~300 but I haven't tried it on my mesmer yet, so I might give that a go

I wish next expansion feature is meaningful guilds.

50 keys. I got a Beast greatsword and shoulders and bunch of fluff.
---
&gt; when he was breaking free in Nightfall the only help the five gods could give was essentially "You can do it, mortals, believe in yourselves."
---
Not to play devil's advocate here, but they had a reasonable justification of why they wouldn't do it themselves (Gods fighting = huge damage on the planet), as has been emphasized with Balthazar in PoF.
---
You can literally play whatever you want. When it comes to complexity, ele&gt;mesmer&gt;necro so people usually suggest necro for beginners. You'll get rekt on all 3 in pvp, but I guess it's a bit more bearable on mesmer/necro.
---
Do know that core game was designed to be played without DLC's so all classes are viable in that area.
---
The old Gerent would be like Triple Trouble but worse though because of its abysmal rewards back then. We had to make sure no pugs were in the map to [upscale the lanes](https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3v5j9z/anet_can_we_just_have_a_bit_more_leniency_on_chak/#ampf=undefined). If I remember correctly, the nuhoch lane had really unfair scaling where you needed like [exactly 14-16](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3t498o/tangled_depths_meta_nuhoch_lane_bugged/cx34mb1/) to stomp the nodules. Too many people and there aren’t enough nodules to complete the bar, too little people and you can’t stomp enough in time. 
---
Sure it was fun organising the event trying so hard to succeed back then, but it will be more dead than triple trouble and pof metas because of how bad the rewards were back then. And just fixing some of the bugs (scaling) would neuter the difficultly significantly already. As it stands I feel the current difficulty of the meta is rather appropriate for the rewards.
---
Ah, no idea then.
---
Man, I want those shoulder so bad, but am I hell paying money for keys. Black Lion Chest need to be binned. 
---
Spellbreaker is awesome I like it ,I'm using mine only for WvW tho roaming and blob fights for the elite skill .I found Spellbreaker nice to play because u can mitigate so much damage. A good Spellbreaker can easy enter enemy blob drop elite skill take a piss on them to show dominance and get out like nothing happened.
---
I got it first try from my Level 10 key run. Same thing with the dragon glider last month...
---
Sigil and runes of strength, for great justice utility skill.
---
Ok this is good to know! I just didn’t want to be limited by my class because I don’t own the DLC thank you 👍
---
[removed]
---
Except that I liked it from day one. Before any fixes at all. Before they removed the need for poison resistance from the story, I was a fan of HoT.  I saw what the devs were going for and felt like they achieved that.
---
More rewards are nice...but to me, more rewards will never make a bad zone good.  
---
I felt like HoT was a giant open world dungeon. I was in danger. I had to think going from place to place. Finally I was in the enemy strong hold and I'd pay for not paying attention.
---
I didn't particularly have problems with the rewards, but obviously more rewards aren't pissing me off.
---
I got it on my first key. 
---
If only such things existed...
---
To be fair every game is a role playing game. You're playing the role of someone else.
---
CHRONO ~~MAIN~~ *JAILED* 
---
XDDDDDD
---
Then there was the time where there were naked dudes standing around random places
---
And they found that out after they initially fought Abaddon and sealed him away, yeah.
---
The main point of my messages, though, is that humans were still able to kill Abaddon.  Gods aren't truly almighty, they're just really powerful beings.  So Balthazar being killed in GW2 fits in just fine with how Guild Wars lore has been all along.
---
That's a fair thing to say.
---
Back then the impression was Paragon was not producing enough money for ncsoft.
---
And guild wars 2 was just coming out.  And there was the idea that ncsoft wanted people to move from City of Heroes to guild wars 2.
---
Regardless, I loved City of Heroes.  I played it for 5 years invested hundreds and thousands of hours to that game.  And for profit only they close the game down.
---
It was very hard to have that game close.
---
If you are a city of Heroes player you would understand.
---
I've migrated to guild wars 2.  The game play,  the guilds, the sociability, even the chat    in guild wars 2 pales in comparison to what city of Heroes was.  City of Heroes was great.
---
I talked to other city of Heroes players and no other game is similar enough to City of Heroes for us to be comfortable in any of the other games.  Guild wars 2 is okay that's not a good replacement for City of Heroes.
---
I may have gotten all the companies primary ownership of these games wrong but it's my belief that ncsoft will close down any game if it's not making the profit they require.  I suppose that's a good business model.  But it's been what four years since they've closed City of Heroes I still think about.  
---
Do I just have very shitty luck with those or are people suggesting them without realizing how low their drop rate is?
---
Magi is a safe budget second place. 
---
I probably do spend maybe $10 a month, but that's my choice and I actually GET things for it. Almost have all the character slots I want, so that's starting to go toward glider skins, and after that mount skins. I get to *voluntarily* support the game when it's convenient for me, and I get rewarded for it with shinies that make me feel badass but are totally optional. Much better than a subscription .

1st key roaring dragon glider

also did it with a guildie and she got roaring on 1st and shoulder on 2nd

Not with personal might but op was asking how the warrior could stack might. Phalanx strength is how that is achieved.
---
Not to OP, *Hidden* chest, you have to use LoD in the final room to get the end chest. 
---
Not sure if it counts since I'm a first time player but I've had fun with mesmer and now chrono
---
Both Jormag and Primordus are dormant in the present time. Remember that (A) the dragons being inactive doesn't suddenly make their minions or corruption vanish and (B) the maps located in the Shiverpeaks are all from a time where they *were* active. All GW2 maps are in a fixed point in time.
---
The only map closeish to the Shiverpeaks we have since they went to sleep is Thunderhead Peaks, and that's probably too southern and contaminated by Kralk anyway.
---
Very beautiful! 
---
City of Heroes was great.  I only got to play it for a very brief period of time, personally, and very much enjoyed the little time I had.  That said, I can't blame or be upset or bitter at ANet for it.  Saying it Pales in comparison, I think, is unfair.  It's certainly very different... to be honest Guild Wars 2 for the most part is a completely different animal from all other MMOs.  CoH was as well, but along a separate standard.  I would rather appreciate two different games for their own positives than to compare and set them against one another myself, while also keeping an eye on the development of City of Titans.
---
It's expected that in any scenario where Kralkatorrik dies, Glint would take a part or all of his magic, making her the new crystal dragon. That means no empowered Zhaitan and a new elder dragon on our side. That was Glint's plan as far as we can tell, had it not gone awry.
---
As for Jennah, I'd be really surprised the strongest mesmer in the world would get overwhelmed. She often underplays her abilities, but Logan's sword is a wooden stick to her nuclear weapons.
---
IMO you should test the frame rate in some sort of instanced content (unless I have a fundamental misunderstanding of how instanced content works).  The randomness of LA will probably create a huge amount of variation.
---
Glint dies before Kralkatorrik is crippled and brought to the ground. Long before Rytlock has a chance to use the spear in Kralkatorrik.
---
Without some added air support - which Logan could not provide - Glint would die regardless of whether or not Kralkatorrik dies.
---
And that the time, the only air support that could be given would be Vlast.
---
So in **every** scenario without Vlast, Glint dies.
---
&gt; As for Jennah, I'd be really surprised the strongest mesmer in the world would get overwhelmed.
---
Literally seconds before she calls for Logan's help, she tried looking into Kralkatorrik's mind and got a severe backlash from trying so. She was recuperating the entire time Logan was holding off (and losing to) the branded army. Had Logan not been there, the branded would have gotten into the keep and swarmed everyone inside, the only thing left to defend the still-recovering Jennah would be a few mook soldiers and a still-recovering Anise.
---
&gt; She often underplays her abilities, but Logan's sword is a wooden stick to her nuclear weapons.
---
You're giving Jennah far too much credit, and Logan not enough. That analogy may work for your run of the mil soldier, but not for Logan or other members of Destiny's Edge or Dragon's Watch. And honestly, Jennah's capabilities are far from that supreme. Her feats are on par to Koro Sagewind and Kitah as seen in GW1, both of which created illusions of entire armies.
---
There are a few zones where trees move noticeably, such as the winter foresty area when you first enter the northern area of Wayfarer's Foothills. There are moving dust clouds in Dry Top during the sandstorms; if you move closer to walls where the 'fog/sand' mist vanishes, you see these huge gusts of dust moving directionally and it's awesome.
---
Around 500 bl chests total (started playing in 2014~). 4 contracts. 
---
At one point I decided to stop argue with my guildmates about how absurd idea of "lucky account".
---
I find making money in GW2 really difficult, and mostly it's probably out of choice, because I don't enjoy things like Fractals or Raids, but anyway, I'm working on making the Pharus longbow, and when I saw these shoulders I immediately wanted them because they look like they'd be a PERFECT match to go with the bow, as it has that shard of spero kind of diamond/floating gem thing in the shoulders.
---
So I basically instantly sold the majority of my long term investment items in order to get a bunch of keys. I ended up spending I'd say between 650-800g on black lion keys in the gemstore. I still didn't get the shoulder piece, but I thought, well, worse case scenario, I have 60 black lion statuette things, and since most other skins eventually become available for 60 of these things, I will just have to wait for it to become available for these statuettes. It sucks, and it shouldn't be so difficult, and to me, it really does feel like a disguised way to make players get used to gambling everything they have in order to get what they want (which is morally so wrong in my opinion). I don't think that will ever change, but I'm just hoping at least I'll be able to get the shoulders later when it's hopefully added to the other items in exchange for the statuettes.
---
In this game, roleplayers tend to be active (and good) across all game modes because that's how you get the nice armor and weapons to RP in. TC has been a top or second-tier server for pretty much the lifetime of the game.
---
&gt; Jormag's been pretty active, he's fucking up the Norns and everyone in the Shiverpeaks real hard.
---
I never said anything different. 
---
He *was* active, until we sucked almost all magic out of him and Primordus.
---
Well, and since we put them to sleep in Flashpoint, we barely heared anything about Jormag and didn't got a new map to find out the current situation about him. 
---
Iirc the last thing we heared about Jormag was from Braham and that he was mad because we put him to sleep and he couldn't fight him because of that.
---
We do, we just do it in guild. Tavern chatter is for downtime.
---
You're not seeing the guild RP. Most of my guildies RP every day, but it's in the guild hall or somewhere out of sight. They sometimes RP in DR but that's for downtime between stuff or meeting folks from other guilds.
---
with vastly different speeds, being 51 gb/s on a 3200 dual quad ddr4 setup (25 in single mode) and 200 gb/s upwards on gpu &lt;&gt; vram.

upgrading your normal ram won't do any shit on your graphic card performance. if the vram flows over, you can / will get stutters / fps drops, that is true...but not the fault of your normal ram.  
---
also fps problems won't magically clip you through a wall so you are there persistent afterwards.

I didn’t even know this existed. Why do they bother devoting resources to pvp when they won’t even attempt to advertise any of the new content?

---
So the reason people run harrier is that it has healing power with concentration (and then also power for a small DPS increase). You want the concentration to keep up boons (Might at 25, fury, regen, protection, swiftness, . If you don't have enough boon duration you won't be able to do what you need to in organised content (fractals and raids). If you're a secondary healer in a raid group then you can rely on another druid to do the job but you're still not able to be a main druid and there are better secondary healers for raids (scourge, tempest, scrapper, firebrand, renegade, or even condi druid). 
---
Magi is going to be your best pure healing gear cleric's is fine but too much toughness will mess up the tanking on some bosses. 
---
If you're going to try to keep up boons your options are limited. There are only 5 sets with concentration and healing power, 2 of which (harrier's and plaguedoctor's) are locked in PoF. The other 3 are Givers, Seraph, and Minstrel's. Givers and Minstrels would work but they have major toughness which, as mentioned before, will mess up the tanking in many raids (highest toughness gets aggro). The last option is Seraph which at that point you may as well just gear it as a [condi druid](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/druid/condition/) and fill in the secondary healer role (or solo on some specific fights with good teams).
---
I live in Malaysia. Was playing on NA for 3 years with 250-300 ping. Recently bought Mudfish VPN and configure it to NA server, got around 200-250. Then I created a new F2P account to test on EU with the VPN config to Best route to EU, got around 180-230 ping depending on time. Changed to EU ever since. 
---
11 Keys and I got it. Then got the dragon glider with the uncommon+ key.
---
My experience upgrading from a Radeon 7770 to a GTX 750 to a GTX 1070 is that you get improvements in FPS for GW2 so long as you are using a significantly better GPU but the improvements are minuscule compared to improving your CPU. Dollar for dollar, you get more bang for your buck spending it on processor than graphics card.
---
I mean, with a Ryzen and a 2080ti, there isn't many more FPS you can squeeze out of the game.
---
I haven't done such an in depth study, but with my 6700k and gtx970, I gained a lot of smoothness and easily 10fps in the few places where I wasn't hitting 60fps (my monitor is 60hz). Of course, world bosses and the likes will always see our performance tank, but that's something else.
---
Probably that sound one of the engie skills makes on use? A turret iirc
---
Just send a time traveling GOLEM to kill Gwen's mother--problem solved!
---
I think a lot of people agreed that those villains in Guild Wars proved to be some of the better written ones. The Lich, Shiro, Joko, etc. There was something appealing about having powerful but overall down to earth villains striving for magical or political strength.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply
---
It makes a huge difference on old dx12 hardware running on low settings (low textures, high model count and distance) and high resolution. By difference I mean stable low FPS, no spikes.
---
The issue is that d912pxy crashes or crashes the game too often to make it worth it, for me, YET.
---
I will get numbers up here once we agree on some common area with as little variation as is acceptable to cause 50 fps to 2 fps drops often enough make a histogram worth analyzing.
---
Might we go with a fractal that is easily accessible? Maybe a world boss? Idk if I notice much of an issue once assets are loaded into video memory on Teq so I am open to suggestions.
---
I've played a fair chunk of Destiny 2, and I'd say to compare the two in terms of relaxation, Guild Wars 2 is going to be the way to go.
---
Guild Wars 2 is very casual friendly, alt-friendly, beautiful, fluid, engaging, and has a one of the most friendly player-bases I've ever come across.
---
The Basics:
---
- Races, 5 of them, tons of customization options, and special voice acting for each race/gender. They have a few unique skills, but nothing game-impacting, similar to how your race in D2 has no effect.
---
- Classes, 9 of them, with only 1 needing to buy an expansion. Every class has access to 5 weapon skills, based on what weapon you have equipped. This changes depending on what class you are, a Warrior with an Axe is going to have different skills than a Ranger with an Axe. Every class also has 1 healing skill, 3 utility skills, and 1 elite skill that helps define the class and playstyle. Lastly, there are F1-F5 skills, and each class has 1-4 of these. For example, Ranger has F1-F4 to control their pet, while Necromancer only has an F1 skill (until way later in the game). 
---
- Tyria, the world where GW2 takes place, is separated into leveled zones, from 1-80. Exploring, gathering, killing mobs, completing events, and helping the locals with their issues (hearts) all contribute to EXP. 
---
- In my opinion, GW2 is my go-to choice for relaxing gameplay. There are more challenging options at the end-game (raids, mini-dungeons called Fractals), but for the most part, everything can be done solo with minimal knowledge of how the game works. Worst comes to worst, the game is free so you won't have to spend a dime if it isn't your style. 
---
And lastly:
---
Tybalt, introduction.

Yes, commander

LA is random, but it's a pretty consistent random. the area around the bank pretty much always have the same level activity.
---
i chose this location because i feel that it is indicative of GW2's main weakness: inconsistent frametimes when there's too many things on screen. if D912pxy is to have any noticeable effect, it is here (and unfortunately on my rig, there's no noticeable effect).

Fractals mostly

[glacial gauntlets! ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heavy_Glacial_Gauntlets) 
---
Either way, Logan is definitely a tool.
---
WVW and open world Scourge with without minions respectively because mashing your face on the keyboard.
---
Hardcore PVE Chrono because it is still broken good.
---
SPVP has been Dragon Hunter but I have been less tied to that since the latest expansion.  
---
While I totally understand where you're coming from (because we see these daily), some people just want some ideas to get re-hooked. GW2 doesn't have a very set-in-stone list of goals for people to accomplish. I'm sure they're all looking for ideas, but yeah, it's annoying when they could easily put this in the weekly question thread, or just try jumping back in before coming here. 
---
Even if it was nearly dead you only need a handful of people to do the main defense events.
---
But as others said, it's not even close to dead.
---
They're pretty rare, but if someone buys keys, I could see that skewing how they view the drop rate.
---
Also you can't buy them from statuettes either :(
---
I'm too poor for free stuff
---
Pointless replies like that make me want to see you get downvoted you further than OP. Maybe you are still clinging to 2012 since nobody really cares about dungeons or guild missions
---
Master race! 
---
Joke's on you; I joined the game right when Jessica Price got the boot. There's no 2012 for me to cling to.
---
But that sycophantic "oh no how dare you take any issue with the gem store" bullshit? Nah, fuck that noise.

ITT: Why ArenaNet keeps doing this.

I can imagine its the toolbelt skill (F5) from the Supply Crate from engineer. It has like a high note beep after deploying.
---
what chest and legs are those??
---
It ain't worth it
---
This is pretty much what every beginner Revenant looks like.
---
Gen 2.5 doesn’t even have a collection 
---
There just time sink (HoT metas or the never ending PoF gift of mastery ) and gold sink (Mystic coins,amalgamated stone and hundreds of mithril/elder wood stacks) 
---
I wish there was a solo mission option for when I can't be online when my guild actually runs them.
---
As for their DPS, They are a bit low but that can be adjusted via simple numbers changes.
---
(if they could share more boons like I mentioned above diviners would also be extremely good as Engi can get a ton of crit from traits.
---
Combat. Combat. Combat.
---
The problem is that the complexity of combat is poorly explained to you by anet if you just started the game five years in it is obvious they didn't plan for someone like you to stick around. Until someone questioned me about a combo field, I had no effing clue, I saw the brief explanation but it's potential was not made at all apparent. After watching a video about combo fields, a whole new world of weapon swapping, skill chaining, etc opened up to me.
---
You can't button mash in this game and expect to be anywhere near average.
---
In PvE WoW, I wondered for the longest time how the hell I was near spot in with my skills/chains/buffs but my dps was considerably lower than guildies of the same class. Low and behold banwave, those guildies were wiped out, they had be skill/dmg botting the entire time and it is hard to beat a script over time when all the dmg botter had to do was move WASD and move from boss mechanics. It is still possible in gw2 but the lack of API makes it a bit harder to get feedback for the script to adjust, not to mention things like player buffs being not always party wide but skillshot/target based makes maximizing output much harder to automate.
---
The point is, there is a high and different ceiling for all forms of combat in gw2 ... and each profession plays very differently. The range of skill choices is incredible.
---
I have been back for a week i just find my Self running i a circle most of the time i LA so i Went here. I didn't mean to annoy People by making this post tho.
---
For the last time, there are no culinary applications for bloodstone dust
---
Thanks for the reply i just found my Self running around LA most of the time didn't make the post to be annoying i was just looking for some ways to get hooked without burning myself out like i just did with WoW bfa
---
At least you tried though, there's more, other posts about how they want to know what's new without googling first and kinda just spamming this subreddit.
---
Sorry if you thought my post came off as snarky or defensive, ,but no. I really felt it was funny because my guild doesn't raid at all. And there are tons of people who play a lot.
---
I'd say Giver's, for the simple reason that it gives the exact same amount of Healing Power and Concentration, but simply replaces Power with Toughness. It's a rather useless stat, but so is Power on its own, especially on a support build.
---
Giver's will probably also be easier to get compared to Minstrel, since it doesn't require HoT or WvW gameplay, just some crafting with snowflakes.
---
There are subscription model games for ppl who want to boo hoo about microtransactions. Not interested in the point less salt
---
Very true, and like I mentioned it's only really relevant with good T4 groups
---
Wow, good call on making them look like brand crystals instead of ice
---
Thank you very much, best of luck to him and the team
---
To be fair, SAB started as an April Fool’s joke...  And by those standards they put in an over-the-top amount of effort into it...  Problem is that it was so well received/loved that it’s grown into a permanent game festival and that’s just extra development that they never really planned for, but try to give love to when they have extra resources.  
---
&gt; I mistakenly believed that according to the Wiki you can get a few from the reward chest at the end of each respective meta...
---
wiki says you get 0-2. 
---
Check out the asura scallywag armor
---
Wiki was right, there's a secret tunnel that leads pretty directly from the starter wp to the entrance to DS. Not sure if you need Lean Techniques as well, but you might be able to use nearby ledges to reach it. 
---
You get there by using the updrafts around the open area near the starting WP. There's a tree with a hole in it through which you can reach the lowest updraft, and the tunnel itself is hidden behind some vines, more or less directly south of that first updraft.
---
Once in there, keep going south, and enjoy the hero challenge along the way!
---
Thanks for the PSA!
---
Been waiting ages to ascend my spinal blades
---
You'd think Anet would be spending every waking resource to fix this. I've only lost a few gold's worth of shit because of this 'slow-loading' bug, but the amount of support tickets they get because of this has to be god-awful.
---
What about it?
---
Considering it hasn't been deleted by the mods nor can I find any specific thing in the rules about it I'm not sure that's entirely the case.
---
Yeah, I forgot to mention that. I like to precast Tactics, Strength, Discipline, and Battle Standard. I guess I just felt like that was a bit too advanced to mention but in hindsight it's pretty basic.
---
Because it's supposed to be *risen* **not** *sunken*.

Doing T4 daily with group of 4.  scourge is in static and does 20-30k DPS. 5th guy is usually 0ar newbie from guild. So I dont know what you mean by that comment.

It's either/or. As OP described, these things are *supposed* to be so fucking big that they make us feel insignificant in their presence, so unless they pull some insane shit with the game engine and our field of view, we will be fighting heads from now on. I don't actually mind, since we already have a ton of gorgeous smaller boss models we get to see in their entirety. The fact that Kralk's head was as big as a mountain makes me think I don't even *want* to see the rest of the thing.
---
I have a hard time consentrating so when i play on maps as AB i put all my music and game noice off becouse if i don't i have a hard time just walking around in tarir not even fighting but i still think its one of the best maps

My full counter never did less than 6000 damage.
---
That left arm is really freaking me out
---
Me too, brother.
---
Go on a comfort food binge, send ANET the bill.
---
I would not advise against pvp, esp. as it is so similar to destiny 2 in general mechanics: cap points, rez dead, fast-paced. There is also a lot of fun from some special members, and they will go out of their way to make clowns of themselves.
---
Consumables/buffs &amp; optimize your rotation, that's it.
---
If i had a fractal reliquiary...

You can (should really, no reason not to) pulse Fury as Glint. The moment you enter combat this trait will trigger on every pulse, giving you might. This pulse has a low interval meaning it can keep up 25 might while in combat on its own. It re applies Might fast enough to not drop below 25 stacks.
---
Also note that any other Fury source from a Revenant will also trigger this trait for even more Might. Glint is simply the best with this trait due to it passively granting Fury.
---

Horizontal progression? Hmmmm
---
I dont believe Defense Will get you top burst damage. Discipline or tactics both give good damage modifiers when used with physical skills and burst skill.

Url is relevant

I Know I'm late to the party, but I've mained as a guardian since launch, I've done just about everything but raids (Cause i dont see the point to them). What I see in the comments is a constant problem with GW2. That being the obsession with meta builds which aim at doing dmg and living just long enough to kill a mob/boss before it can kill you back. while i will admit, saves a lot of time when it works. the truth is that the typical player isnt meta, and if they arent meta, your meta build is useless. As a guardian you are given so much survivability and support that you can easily carry a team of newbs/non-meta. but to be meta build is to rely on it. if you are a meta/power/boon build you will not do well in about 80-90% of the raid/dungeon/fractal teams you'll come across, as they will not be. so its live by the meta, die by the meta. thats something meta sycophants' dont tell you. As a guardian you can be Anything, a tank, a glass cannon, a supporter... the trinity is alive in Guardians, but to be effective you need a strategy as to be full tank is penalized by low dps. You'll solo just about anything champion or otherwise, but it can take time most dont have patience for. Ill add more to this later but Im on mobile at work and prefer a keyboard for my full advice.
---
Awesome resource. Thank you.
---
I never even thought about asuras having butts but looking at this image now makes me nervous
---
Ah alright. Figured this might be the case. Also thanks for confirmation on my gear being good enough. Just wanted to make sure.

exalted shoulders on the 113th

everything else was only uncommon (exalted shoulders are uncommon; but [i mean like this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/airznd/when_all_you_want_is_the_exalted_shoulders/); no rares or super rares
---
I got both of them...yay me

I guess like, it didn't have any specific, practical reason to be there, but I'm talking more about thematic reasoning, narrative integrity and relishing in Guild Wars history. :P

---
Hi, so I'm new to the game and just hit 80 a few days ago and had some questions about progressing so please bare with me if these get asked every day. 
---
1- What are the silver-wastes dailies? What should I be doing there everyday? For that matter, what "should" I be doing everyday to maximize my gold/item chances/reccomended achievement progress (for masteries etc)
---
2- I've heard it's wise to keep a level 49ish alt to open chests/bags to sell mid-level materials from the loot you get, is this only for certain bags/chests? All of them? Are there any I definitely should or should NOT move from my 80 to a 49 to open? 
---
3- What's a strong build for cruising through the story on a Thief? i'm trying to do the achievements for each step as i go, but in the PoF chapters some of the bonus objectives just seem outright impossible for me, and i am wearing full exotic gear in every possible slot, and using a pistol/pistol deadeye build from metabattle. is there something tankier/stronger (just for powering through this aspect of the game) or do i just need to git gud?
---
4- Speaking of story line, I have unlocked my raptor and springer from PoF and just started chapter 1 of HoT to get my glider, is there something i should focus on next that improves my QoL or enables me to do things faster/more efficiently? 
---
5- if you were playing a thief and could pick 2 crafting professions only, no alts with professions either, what would they be? i dont really like managing multiple alts so for the time being only plan to play the one character so looking for the best crafting profs with regards to ascended and eventually legendary gear. 
---
thanks very much for any answers you guys are able to provide. i love this game!
---
Pretty sure the bank contract has filled that void 10 fold.
---
Spellbreaker and Dragonhunter
---
 Think I'll just stick to the exalted backpack
---
That's how I got the dragon glider, the shrine guardian jackal, and literally every mini mounts pack
---
It's due to the angle of the pose lol
---
Alright looks like I'll be crafting some ascended maces. Thanks guys. Looks like the typical Flanged Mace is the cheapest option? Guess I'll be going for that. Let me know if there's an option I missed, since as far as I'm aware, there's no collections for an ascended mace.
---
Get it then get it ascended one. It's like 15% cooler.
---
Probably because the people who shat on HOT are the ones praising POF and vice versa.
---
I'm glad we have two very distinct expansions. 
---
Out of interest, did you commission this? If not, did you get permission to share this piece from the artist? 
---
&gt; i chose this location because i feel that it is indicative of GW2's main weakness: inconsistent frametimes when there's too many things on screen. if D912pxy is to have any noticeable effect, it is here (and unfortunately on my rig, there's no noticeable effect).
---
Eh, I think it's the other way around. In my evaluation there are two distinct classes of performance anomalies in GW2, the character object overhead which seems to be primarily CPU-limited, and what I'm guessing is scene overdraw which is primarily GPU-limited.
---
ANet devs have indicated in the past that the principle bottleneck (Which I suspect is said character overhead) is outside the renderer, and given your results that would seem to confirm as much.
---
If possible, I'd be interested if you can do some comparisons at some of the points where I suspect overdraw is the culprit. The central pillar at Champion's Dawn in Istan, Shipwreck Peak in Verdant Brink and Tarir from Northwatch are a few examples.
---
My dear friend,
---
Remember that Glint's gift to us after completing the trial was hope. We already had hope coming out of every orifice. We've killed 2 dragons and a God. We knew this would be hard but we were pretty convinced of our own past successes, why the heck does the Commander need hope? We didn't need hope to take the battle to Kralk, we needed hope for right now. But I implore you to have hope. Also, do you need an internet hug?

All of my love,

In WvW, we had the same issue, turns out it was the 1 skill of the medipacks. Maybe there is an equivalent in PvE?

TD is my favourite map in the game! 
---
I just love how vertical it is and might also be because I love the chak maybe a bit too much. I spent way too much time grinding for the Hivemaster title.
---
Maybe I should really seek medical help. 
---
Cool style
---
Cool sword also 
---
I got a 5 key pack and unlocked chests late at night and got some shoulder things. Went straight to bed and read how some shoulder item was lusted after the following morning on here. Didn’t realise they were those till after I got home from work.
---
This post looks like a random shit storm against Engineer. In PvE, Holosmith is perfectly fine and can be used in multiple scenarios, both raids and fractals. It can use rifle or sword, depending on hitbox and personal preference. You have even many utility options, running bomb and/or grenade kit, swapping out one kit for rifle turret or the personal battering ram or even the photon wall if you want to block stuff (looking at you, shaking Slothasor).
---
Regarding Scrapper, it has an incredible heal output if played right, but has a high skill barrier for that. Also, it requires the players to work with it. Hammer is a fun weapon in my opinion having tons of blocks, ccs and everything you need in open world. Still, I see why it is criticised since it's main purpose PvP is not working anymore (see below). 
---
PvP wise, Engineer in general is broken since they finally nerfed Auto-Elixir-S.
---
but first you have to pass thees trials 
---
She's not gone.
---
You have to have hope, Brother/Sister.
---
She ate the Lich. The Immortal Lich. The one bragging about it's "drastically understated" immortality.
---
She while come back to us.
---
Hope is all we have now.
---
(But comfort food isn't a bad solution either.)
---
You can actually report a map as bugged in game, and GMs will force close it.  
---
A few weeks ago pala got stuck, and people just started reporting the map as bugged. I was so shocked that a few minutes later the map closing message poped up, i though nothing was gonna happen and the map will stay bugged for ever @_@.  
---
Tho you probably need several reports to get GM attention.
---
I mean is there any other way to handle such missions?

[Whenever you need to break a break-bar.](https://discretize.eu/builds/warrior/banner-warrior)  Having the discipline specialization means you have 5s weapon-swaps vs. normal 9s swaps.  The gist of what that means is that your weapon-swaps come off cooldown twice as quickly.  If you learn the fights well you can preemptively swap to mace for your CC rotation and then immediately swap to Axe/Axe or GS and burst.

---
The problem with Scrapper is that Gyros are being phased out of the Traitline in favour of hammer related traits.
---
Now almost every trait seems to point to "hey, use hammer" and Gyros are like a utility only tool now, not a feature.
---
Imo what I would do is make Gyros replace F1-F5 and allow Scrappers to free up their Utility slot.
---
Gyros work like Glint Facets and are toggle for effect and exploded for secondary effect with a cooldown.
---
Heal Gyro will heal a small amount every few seconds and popped for a cleanse.
---
Shredder Gyro will perform a combo whirl every second when in combat for 5 seconds then auto pop itself to knockback.
---
Bulwark Gyro will reduce all allies damage taken by 33% and take it on itself, popping it will provide a dome which reflects projectiles.
---
Blast Gyro will inflict 5 Vulnerability on player's target for 3 seconds and will auto pop for a blast finisher along with fire field on the target.
---
Sneak Gyro will pulse Stealth every few seconds and popping it will jam Stealth in AoE revealing enemies until they leave the AoE.
---
I was wondering why this post is tagged [Fluff] and Gaming .... it should be tagged  [lockbox] and  Gambling... lol those shoulders look nice though!

personally i am not a big fan of roleplaying and roleplayers in general, it happens a lot in Rata Sum. But i'd rather avoid it and leave the map rather then bullying players for what they like to do most.

Blood Legion Stealthing. The alternative stealthing.

Overkill for open world

I literally did so a few days ago. It still was not hard. I recommend you do the same.
---
Between necromancer and guardian, which is more durable?
---
"GUILD" wars 2.
---
Seems like a waste to me. Dungeons are easy to run and pretty fast so 500 tokens is really a trivial task that you should consider a nice change of pace when crafting legendaries.
---
If your issue is "But LFG is empty !" you would be surprised how quickly groups can still fill today.
---
If your issue is "But pick-ups are horrible !" you could also be surprised by how easy it is to clear dungeons even with beginners when you stop trying to speed run/stealth skip through the content.
---
Ah, the traditional way to complete the obligatory optional stealth part of the game.
---
Ah thanks! I took my time exploring hammers hoard and let LOD expire before I could make it to the final room. Lesson learned!!
---
Really pretty :D
---
the best hiding spot is behind giant flesh golem
---
I basically just run the raid build for condi holo but with that one trait swapped in open world, if you're used to condi engi/holo then it's a really fun build, good for story and farming. Still a bit squishy and no stunbreaks (if you're getting stunned a lot, swap out bomb or grenade kit for elixir u), basically relies on blinds and cc to avoid damage, so be careful around stuff with defiance bars. It's not strictly an optimized open world build, but if you like do do instanced content as well and don't wanna have to keep track of multiple builds, it's nice to play. Good for farming too with the flamethrower.
---
I got the Glyph of the Leatherworker from an early map completion key and just kind of went "oh neat" and used it. They go for about 200g on the trading post. 
---
I mean, it's cool and all, but I think I'd have rather had the 200g at the time. 
---
I also got the dragon glider skin from a map completion key recently. I actually quite like that one.
---
if you don't care about AR, you are much better off using wvw infusions
---
I did. And you are not being honest about your experience. 
---
I only hope this doesn't turn out to be too good profit so they do it constantly from now on. I'm really tired of lootboxes...
---
my fractal group is on a break, but to increase the dps of the team i went seraph FB with harrier rene; i can do about 8\~12k dps, my rene between 2 and 5k. this way we got the boons/healing covered and push out more dps!
---
This happens because a flag that denotes that the amount is too low is only checked when *preparing* the sale, but not when confirming it. I mailed exploits@ with a detailed explanation a couple weeks ago.
---
Whats that headpiece called? 
---
Apart from the fact we basically 1v1 Balthazar, whereas it took an army to overrun Abaddon, ah ah.
---
I see. My personnal challenge is to dodge the shockwave from Amala in Oasis fractal. The one supposed to kill the team. One day I'll succeed.
---
It's an MMORPG, not a single player game
---
Lol i don't get why all these downvotes. He asked how to improve his dps, and i answered the same thing snowcrows says: full +5 stat on all the equipment. +5/+5 is cheaper, but if he wants to do fractals on high level he'll need to trash away those infusions and replaced with +5/+9
---
hi, try updating ur graphics card, and using max performance on nvidia panel, and check that the application is indeed using the 1070
---
Scarlet's Veil
---
But he's rich, ya know.
---
Scepter/Dagger ele is very easy to play if you can kite the mobs and know where and when to place/use the skills.
---
You need to play ranked, get all the pips till the last reward. It takes about 120-150 games with 1win-1 lose ratio. Last 3 chests give you 1 grandmaster mark each and youll have enough shards.
---
It's tangled. It's deep. It's exactly what it said it was. 
---
But it's still the only HoT map I don't have map completion for. 
---
are those still obtainable?
---
It's not like you'll ever use all that much gold, really.
---
.
---
Exactly. Plus i liked the collections (Only missing H.O.P.E) if there's one thing i dislike is time-gated shit (Looking at Astralaria/Aurora) That just presses my buttons.
---
hang in there, the feeling will pass. go down to your local pub, have a pint, and wait for all this to blow over.
---
If not for defense any attack I didn't dodge or full counter I'd lose a big chunk of HP. Ignoring that, I was thinking arms would be better than disc or tactics? Arms increases dual wielding speed and lowers signet recharges, in addition to giving ferocity for each signet equipped.
---
I’m about to go to sleep, and seeing as how you used 175 keys for this...I’m going to also cry in my sleep, and maybe when i wake up. 
---
Mh, nope. Last week i started the ad infinitum Collection and i plan to craft the legendary backpack in a few days. Definetly not empty, fractals are quite fun and rewarding
---
:(
---
In general I'd say necromancer, they have high base life with another life bar in the form of death shroud. They also have minions to tank for them.
---
Guardians have automatic healing and blocking (aegis) but they also have the lowest base health to compensate. They do have heavy armor though and the firebrand elite spec (PoF expansion) can be a really good healer. 
---
For Heart of Thorns, it's fairly good at telling you which masteries you need when. I think you basically need to unlock the second or third mastery from each line to progress in the story. 
---
Ley Line Gliding is needed in some raids, so if you're not working towards anything specific that's a good one to go for.
---
For crafting: leatherworking for your armour and whichever one is linked to your preferred weapon type (huntsman for ranged, weaponsmith for melee).
---
Sadly I can't afford anything of the sort after making my ascended weps and armor.
---
Its gw2, it has always been like this. Just play something else meanwhile :)
---
No collections for one, no. But I'd hold off on crafting them until you actually need the AR. The damage difference is minimal, and just going through fractals gives you chances to get ascended equipment drops. T1 and T2 fractals are easy enough that fights will be over before you're even able to do a rotation.
---
You'll find that the buffs from other lines will give more. And this also answers your question, the other person you are refering to probably runs a completely dps optimized build, such as a fractal dps spellbreaker. If you want dps you gotta sacrifice the comforts of high hp and such
---
smaller WvW gvg's are surely a thing. there's a discord for Guilds that participate in GvG's and depending on collour we can go Edge of the Mists to GvG
---
If you're interested i might be able to get you hooked with an invite link! just poke me privately

I made my current main about 2 weeks after launch because I was still trying out classes. Coincidentally that day was my actual RL birthday. So a year later when Anet sent out the first birthday gifts I thought they used my actual birthday, until I noticed everyone around me had gotten their gifts as well.
---
You didn't asked for a cheap way (well, there isn't) 
---
eat a sandwich 
---
1-Silverwastes is an endless cycle of meta events, there isn't a "daily". Grab a couple of cheap magic find boosters, do RIBA (do events rotating between Red-Indigo-Blue-Amber) until Vinewrath, finish that event and follow the commander to open all the Found Bandit Chests you can until the meta resets.
---
Dailies depend on what expacs you have. My daily routine (gold-wise) usually consists of: daily achievement, home instance (only worth it if it's maxed out, you can ask guildmates if they can open a full instance for you or put up a party in LFG-parties), T4s+CMs fractals, Istan Palawadan+Great Hall, Verdant Brink Matriarch, Auric Basin Tarir, maybe Tangled Depths Gerent, chests in Tomb of Primeval Kings on my parked alts.
---
For achievements do the daily one on a daily basis and then pick whichever looks easy/fun/interesting to you and go for it. If you're going to be spending some time in the Silverwastes, try killing the legendary mobs if they spawn for some easy masteries.
---
2-Opening on a low level character is profitable on containers not affected by magic find, and the profit depending on which level is calculated [here](https://silverwastes.loltools.net/). All you get from SW should be opened with a bag opener, Palawan Phylacteries doesn't matter because it'll be lvl 80 gear and if in the item's description it says that it's affected by magic find maxing this out is the only thing that matters. The only thing I suggest you don't open is unidentified gear and sell it straight to TP, you'd need to first max your personal MF to get more profit.
---
3-I don't play much thief, but it's a very squishy class, so knowing your enemies and how to avoid the attacks that will down you is even more important than with other classes. Is your gear berserker/assassin stats? If you get ascended gear, using marauder stats is a small dps loss but the extra hp can help you stay alive until you get the hang of your class. Also are you using a fractal/dungeon/raid build? Those are tailored for group content as you can rely on a healer, so you might want to swap traits and utilities to get more self-sustain.
---
Unless you're very _very_ lucky, the practical cost is something like 900 gold divided by the number of gifts of ascensions you want to buy (+ 25 relics). Okay, _maybe_ the fractal bags once in a while too :) Mega-expensive. It's like getting American Express Centurion card so you can buy BigMac with it :(
---
&gt; imperceptible gains in average and maximum FPS
---
I spent half an hour mooching round the Silverwastes this morning thinking "wow, this is smoother" and then it turned out I had turned the plugin off last night because I was raiding and I didn't want to suddenly vanish. 
---
I've not had any crashed from the proxy apart from on the very first public release. What it *did* do was remind me to check my graphics settings and tweak them a bit. 
---
It's a solid idea and it's getting more and more stable with every release, but at the moment it's just a bit underwhelming for me. 
---
I think that only works for zombie apocalypses and not existential crisises (crisi?).
---
Yep but i still dungeons need a upgrade.
---
Or atleast some special limited items or something.
---
Nobody runs the harders dungeon since its not worth it.
---
Yes, and I find it increasingly difficult to keep playing the game after every episode. It's like I absorb a bit of disappointment with every new episode after completing it in a single afternoon.
---
Means it's time to consume some elder dragon 😈
---
hm, no. episode 4 hold me for around 6 weeks straight (and then there was halloween + wintersday) in the game and I am playing episode 5 still every day.
---
love the maps, the metas, the achievements and collections.
---
"You can't be noticed if there is nobody left to see got"  too good lol. 
---
Oh gosh, really? *I had no idea.*
---
Did you try reading the *entire* sentence, or did you just vomit out that tired old one-liner as soon as you saw "not in a guild"? I addressed more than just that one scenario, if you'd care to finish sentences.
---
Too late, I fear.
---
 It's still pretty close to that, if you're willing to kill everything that moves.
---
I will feel empty until alliances comes out FeelsWeirdMan 
---
I play it mostly for the story
---
Is nobody else gonna talk about this unleaked armor set???? (skirt, boots, gloves?)
---
I'm pretty sure it's not in the game actually.. feel free to prove me wrong though, I could be forgetting!
---
As far as I know, ascended should be only 5% cooler, where did you get those extra 10%?
---
Reddit is for sharing information. You put up a link to existing stuff and that is it. Noting wrong here. If you re upload and try to present stuff as your own that's a different question.
---
thats totally fine. but why do you feel empty then, when you did everything that interested you?
---
Not just for Daredevils. I sometimes equip the Daredevil skinned on my necromancer.
---
It's a long bare rod, but when you attack, a shadowy scythe appears. Which looks pretty cool.
---
I always felt that the other ornaments didn't really fit that affect well.
---
torch is usefull because its a another aoe.
---
This is precisely what I miss
---
As much as I agree, it's still fun to use something like The Crossing as a daredevil, because the little lantern goes absolutely berserk when you spin it.
---
for the rest of eternity ?
---
fascinating and obscure bug you found there xD
---
Alliance was just an out of season april fools joke lol, you get jebatied
---
Not at the moment
---
Feel empty? Are you that invested in the story? Gw2 Lore is rich and interesting but the way it is presented and all the tech limitations, make it less significant for me. It's like a side content to me. Something to do as new areas, masteries and other things to explore are added. 🎃
---
Wish I could use the Improvised Hammer as a staff skin...
---
No I love the magnitude of the story rn
---
I am. How is it so hard to understand that I really didn't have any trouble with it? I really do not see the difficulty in it. You just click the Sparks and they die. But your entire argument basically revolves around:
---
I think it's easy.
---
'Go back to replay it' 
---
I recently did and it wasn't hard
---
'You forgot how hard it was do it again'
---
It still wasn't hard.
---
'You're lying'
---
i am currently playing Guild Wars 1 to get my mind of the horrible cliff hänger :D
---
but i think that's not an option for everyone
---
tho you are not alone with your issue ;P
---
Because you are lying about one of the most widely troublesome missions in all of Prophecies. Humblebragging. 
---
I had the same feelings as OP. There are lots of details in Tarir. 
---
Brave Brave Sir Logan.
---
Not saying i don't, it's just not the main content for me.
---
this post was brought to you by ACME
---
I have also heard this sound!! I have no idea what causes it and it has confused me countless times.
---
Do not make PvP your way of getting a weapon, there are more optimal ways to do so.
---
stuff like this is part of an MMO with any kind of AuctionHouse-System, A-Net is not responsible for the mistakes of the individual players
---
Who says bonking enemies with a Raven on a stick is not a melee oriented stave.
---
The " guild " from " guild wars " as nothing to do with our guild in game.
---

---
I always got distracted by map completion while doing story and end up maxing my level before reaching level 70 story
---
I would suggest you try your benchmark again, with way higher settings than you're currently using: Character model limit and quality on 'low' will greatly reduce the number of draw calls, which is the biggest culprit of poor DX9 performance and is what DX12 is supposed to help with. Put them on 'highest' (even if you realistically will never play with those settings) and you might have more accurate results on how things are being improved.
---
On a side note, the largest gain on minimum fps is exactly what the author has advertised on his github repo, if anything it shows that the dll is doing what he said it would...
---
Personally, i'm looking forward to it being fully finished, as a WvW player, a largest gain on minimum fps alone can make a noticeable difference in how playable a giant blob fight turns out to be.
---
Magitech skirt, vigil medium gloves, racing scarf. Cant remember the name of the boots.
---
Holy shit this got me thinking what if GW3 is a mobile game. 
---
It's publicly available on deviantart and the artist signature is still on the piece. Why would you need to ask for permission to share this? o_o
---
He is a she. That necro pilot is a girl :)
---
Screenshot? I am curious!
---
Still hoping this day will come for me and my sister. 
---
Good luck! 
---
1. Rob the bank
---
2. Hide the money
---
3. Go to jail
---
4. Got released, find the money, buy all the episodes and expansions
---
5. Play em all at once
---
6. Profit??
---
Genius right here
---
"Buff engi pls"
---
"This looks like a post against engi"
---
Ah gotta love that special brand of reddit logic.
---
As per usual, /u/_Frustr8d proves he doesn't know anything about meta. 
---
Do. Your. Fucking. Research.
---
While true, since it is a game that has guilds so strongly rooted in the lore, you would imagine they would give them more love. Guild missions were such a great idea and gave you something to do as a group and extra incentives to be in a guild as well.
---
Crises (cry-sees)
---
guardian, way more sustain, tankier, can spam out boons, blocks for days, invulns etc. Necro is just a glorified punching bag, so it needs a support to help stay alive.
---
How about you try first with character details, number of models and post processing.
---
Your results aren't that relevant at this point but I think that your increase in low fps is still worthwhile.
---
You've tested at 4K, which is going to be more GPU intensive than lower resolutions. So yes, at 4K, it doesn't seem worth it. For people at lower resolutions, the difference has been much bigger.
---
Because when you post it people think you made it.
---
I want a Big sister 2
---
I’m everyone’s big sister. 
---
Here you are: [https://imgur.com/a/ly0wwdy](https://imgur.com/a/ly0wwdy)
---
You can't control other people stupidity, tho.
---
It's not humblebragging at all though? I just genuinely had little trouble with it, and I don't see the problem other people who have heroes have with it. 'One of the most troublesome missions in a game that's not hard' does not mean something is hard. That's like claiming it's more difficult to explore Queensdale than other starting maps, so Queensdale is very hard to explore, even though exploration is super easy in any game including GW2.
---
Necromancer in PvE, Guardian everywhere else.
---
Really, I'm just curious as to where the subreddit stands on artwork being shared by someone that hasn't commissioned the piece, doesn't own the character and didn't create the art.
---
Generally, on other platforms such as Instagram, Tumblr or Twitter, creating new posts with other people's artwork isn't seen as good etiquette - it could be that absolutely no one involved in the creation of the piece is happy with the art being posted in that place or used in such a manner.
---
It also means, as trivial as it may sound, that it isn't the artist or commissioner receiving the upvotes, likes and shares. That can be pretty damaging since the person that made the art might be missing out on being able to attract new work opportunities through self-promotion. 
---
to be fair the legendaries released with HoT are way better in their precursor acquisition than the gen 1. I've done C&amp;C and almost done with Nevermore, and I loved the Chuka &amp; Champawat story the precursor quests tell.
---
Also, it comes with some ultra cute baby tigers on your back, so...
---
Ele. The only character i have lvl 80
---
I don't think you can generalize that.
---
Playing PvE only and I have more than enough to keep me busy almost all the time.
---
I played some PvP but the conquest format is really not my thing and the learning experience is not really pleasant. That's without mentioning all the afk/win trade stories one can read here. Also when people that play PvP tried to lure me in we got stuck by the level requirement for ranked :D
---
I'm also generally not the competitive kind of player, coop all the way !
---
I am pretty sure some people just find no interest whatsoever in doing meta events or fractals or whatever because the competition keeps them entertained and there's no satisfaction in beating static content to them.
---
I will say that you are right in that being able to appreciate both aspects is really nice and everyone should at least try. But I strongly disagree that anyone is necessarily "missing out big time" if not.
---
i would say of the three you listed, necromancer is probably the toughest but also most boring core class
---
Not worthwhile for you perhaps, but I personally for insane fps gainz while using it
---
I was beginning to think it was only me. 
---
The people who aren't making gold off Istan are the people who haven't changed their methods. I make *substantially* more gold off Unidentified Gear now than I did before, more than enough to counteract the lower VM. People who go "you used to get more VM this sucks" don't seem to have noticed that rare UnID drops all over the place if you use cleave and AoEs.  
---
You can no longer half-participate and only focus on champs. Whomp out a few AoEs and cleave and you'll be raking it in again. 
---
Did you know this game had a hunger games minigame? It's called Southsun Survival or something like that. It's forgotten for some reason. Anet can't advertise their stuff. 
---
Thanks for doing a proper test. Personally I think a bearable minimum FPS is very important for enjoying a game.
---
On that note it makes me sad that the game can seemingly only provide 27 fps in Lion's Arch with a beast like your system, and your settings are not even that demanding.
---
In that regard I think the Proxy is a step in the right direction. I hope its stability and compatibility will be improved in the future, and maybe it'll even be picked up by ArenaNet.
---
I do believe there's a LFG option?
---
Crafting/fractals would be a good route as well. However, just wanted to point out rq that OP is not asking how optimal it is to get Ascended weapons from PvP, just how long it takes.
---
I play a mesmer and levelling it was completely fine.
---
Mesmers have a focus on summoning illusions to do damage and tank for you, which doesn't really change until you get to very high difficulty stuff when it usually shifts to a support role. Totally viable with just the core specs. 
---
Kichmad answers that part.
---
This is an old bug.
---
It happens when there is a disconnect between GW1 and 2 servers. If you check your achievements panel and had any HoM points you lose those and get this e-mail. It's fixable by relogging, and sometimes logging into GW1 and talking to the guy in HoM.
---
If you had GWAMM you'd know, by the way.
---
Sheeesh that must've been nerve-wracking. Glad you got it though!
---
I suggest the Aetherblade fractal. I get a noticeable FPS drop in the first area with enemies, right after the diving section at the beginning.
---
Other troubled areas performance-wise are Thunderhead Keep (where top-meta happens) and Champion's Dawn in Domain of Istan.
---
I think you need to pause re-read, and understand what you asked first. Then re-read my response again. Yes, 99% of the players suck, but that doesn't mean they have a 0% chance. You're a funny man.
---
yeah nobody get's GWAMM on accident :D
---

This is a friendly reminder         that it's "by accident" and not "on accident".

I use them when needed. Usually the last fight at Chaos or the last one at Urban battleground. The thing is, to be a goood Banner boi, you need to adequate yourself as a Warrior, go spellbreak if you need to boonstrip, go maces if needed, or do dmg to do the fractal more faster (core ax/ax + gs) It will depend on the fractal and your previous knowledge of it.
---
Thank you for the very detailed summary. I tried your suggestions, including food. I noticed not only me but also the entire party had good amount of might. I wonder what weapon sigils should I use to  keep high DPS. Also, I wonder is it better  to use Mace/Mace instead of greatsword? I think my main weapons should be Axe/Axe right?
---
Go loud or go home.
---
So true, so true.
---
*smack smack smack smackidy smack*
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **4th Cakeday** friggarn! ^(hug)
---
God for reals 
---
I love the alter, but why Intet? Intet has some of the best dragon art in the game. 
---
You told him to spend over 2k gold On stat infusions. That's just terrible advice. 
---
If he wants to further increase his stats he should play wvw for those cheaper infusions or grind fractals for a bit more expensive ones with AR.
---
One-saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan owo
---
And blasting might with a firefield through the use of banners etc
---
Not according to the new rytlock lore
---
It probably will be.
---
I couldn't agree more. They're on automatic pilot since living season 3. They found a format they feel comfortable with and got along with it. It's a shame we don't have guild mission in LS and expansions maps... It's a pity.
---
If you want karma just type "my first legendary" with a picture of you holding a legendary and then say what you actually wanted to type.
---
&gt; by disconnect too
---
That's the thing. Almost 7 years on market, still no way to reserve a spot on map on disconnect. I guess the technology just isn't *there* yet.
---
Well, yeah, I was hoping that there is some middle ground between Colin's two-week  update schedule and the current 2-3+ months one. 
---
The Sunspear, the Darkspear, the  Sunscythe, the Suntouched Scythe, the Envoy Scythe. They have been all released during the current Living World season. Does not seem to me they stopped.
---
Agreed. I use the Plasma Staff as it fits into my Daredevil’s ‘Master Chief Roboninja’ aesthetic. :)
---
Buy items worth 1250g to get something that is normally worth 500 Fractal Relics (ONE daily fractal full run). Totally worth it.
---
Or a harp (see recent orchestral skins.)
---
&gt; Buying both is cheaper than buying just one expansion. But if you can't afford one, then it depends on what you prefer.
---
Buying both where? From arena net or online somewhere?
---
That's not a terribile advice lel. Just because you're poor it doesn't mean it's a terrible advice 
---
Gz, im still trying to convince my brother to join
---
Your testing methodology is insufficient, specially when you can not control all factors. Like the amount of players that show up and what each player does on the screen. You need to do several runs to get any meaningful data.
---
You can also argue that your setup and graphic settings will not show a great benefit. With 4k resolution and low character limit.
---
The most important thing is stable FPS. Max FPS is completely meaningless. Average FPS has some meaning, but it can be misleading, if the fps jumps from 40 to 80 all the time, the average of 60 seem good, but the gameplay can be quite jerky. In any case, getting above a min fps of 30 is always a win. 
---
I've gotten used to it at this point. 1 Exciting week of new map and content and stuff and then autopilot the rest of the weeks for a couple months on raids and stuff. It's not all bad of course, as that does give me alot of time to play other interesting games like Kingdom Hearts 3
---
Gods, didn't know but....Asura have the cutest butts of all races.
---
Long story short: you can’t. 
---
I believe you can still get keys from open world drops and map completion, but don’t quote me on that. Essentially locking a whole country out of getting exclusive items is just so daft. 
---
meh, 7 keys and i got em.
---
Hey look, it's the monthly post about this.
---
Same with the Bifrost's rainbow trail, that thing just goes EVERYWHERE when you're flailing it around.
---
Thank you very much, I just got the message and lost all my previous HoM points, got scared quite a bit that there might be something wrong with my old GW1 Acc. So yeah, thanks a lot again. 
---
Aetherblade sounds good as you don't have to wait every other hour to repeat a run.
---
I am going to go forward with this idea. With the OP's permission I will grab a gdrive copy of OP's spreadsheet. I'll make sure take a screenshot for reference of starting point of FPS recording as well as provide in game settings and computer specs.
---
of course you're one of those "complex rotations should deal more damage"..cc and cleave really? you mean like holo and slb have?
---
pugs not kicking you doesn't make a build good
---
with condi dps scourge you give like 2.5k barrier, a bit more than a boss aura tick..very very handy yea! and boy that single condi cleanse on 3 people is just godsend..who else is gonna remove 1 single condi otherwise? the druid? the chrono? the random engi with heal turret?
---
i give up..belive whatever you want since you are clearly delusional af..
---
&gt; maybe they are just bad players and has nothing to do with profession
---
finally you said something that makes sense
---
&gt; but I wonder if they tried easier classes if the outcome would be the same
---
easier yes! like the evade-spam mirage or daredevil, not the 2 dodges only necro
---
I wasn't being facetious.
---
I'll just stick with Bo on my DD for now...
---
So.... A low effort post?
---
That's like telling someone asking for a way to get a trinket that he should start the collection for Aurora.
---
I highly doubt your characters are full of cosmetic infusions placed there for the extra stats. 
---
Why stop at the cheap ghostly ones anyway, why don't you get 18 of  [Those](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chak_Infusion#itemct81825). Don't tell me you're poor and can't afford it.
---
Anet, since they're the ones with the best discounts anyway. Usually half off.
---
Bouncing Mushrooms Mastery
---
Yepyep. There are still a few commanders out there, there's no reason to have abandoned the zone. 
---
Awwww that’s actually so sweet!
---
My dads mate got him into guild wars who got my sister into guild wars who intern got me into guild wars.
---
Same here, quit in early BFA. Waiting for classic.
---
Regarding GW2 - every person has their own goals.
---
For me it was: get all ascended gear, max out the masteries, do fractals + cms, get into raiding, min max my class and become rly good player, be able to do max benchmark dps, get X and Y legendary, pvp leg back, legendary armors, get ascended gear for my X and Y alt (actualy I don't even touch alt till its full ascended) etc etc. 
---
There is a lot to do in this game, set your own priorities. 
---
You need to check how that increase was achieved. Specifically, check the frame time graph in my google sheets. Notice how they are roughly equal, with the exception of a single large spike near the middle of the run.
---
I'm also measuring min/max/avg FPS using the most unflattering most unflattering manner: inverse of max/min/avg frame time. In normal benchmarking, that single spike would've been completely smoothed over, because most benchmarks use inverse averaged frame time over one second instead.
---
Remind him that it’s free to play - that’s what sucked my sister in!
---
My main is fully geared with ghostly infusions, yes. He never asked for a cheap way. If you want to maximize your dps, you don't have many ways after food and optimal Gear. I bought ghostly infusions because they are the cheaper and faster way to achieve that goal. Other money can go in other type of things: legendary armor (which i already have) and legendary weapons or backpack (which i'm working toward), which are definetely more useful than a cosmetic infusion
---
Sycthes aren't really my aesthetic, but I guess I'm wrong. I suppose they have added a few. I guess I more meant less heavy looking staves. The Sunspear/darkspear just isn't something I'd see a finesse themed character using.
---
You can creat a Big sister guild
---
indeed
---
That's not a melee stave though. It's a healing staff made by Saul, designed to resemble his old weapon back when he was a monk in GW1.
---
things practically a melee weapon chief
---
what leggings are those?
---
I think crying a sea is a valid response to that ending
---
I'm not your chief, bud
---
i'm not your bud, guy
---
Forgive me I'm terrible at writing on my phone and I was half asleep. What I meant to ask was, if I'm not apart of a guild and know that another guild is checking on the rats can I help and participate by helping them check for him? Or do I have to be apart of their guild in order to activate finding him. 
---
&gt; flex
---
Wrong.
---
I actually wanted to do some benchmarking.
---
They don't mean empty in the sense of "well nothing left to do now" (I think)
---
That emptiness is more likely about the emotional hole the story leaves in someone after ripping out their heart
---
Fractals:
---
- Seraph Boonbrand: Poop out Quickness, Stab, Prot, Might, Fury, Retal while doing somewhat respectable Burning Damage and having access to 3 pulls
---
- Power Renegade: Bursts are quickly accessible again, good for battles with lots of phases. Extra Jalis street gives Stab. Also Staff is T1 breakbar killer. Lots of Self Sustain due to Lifeleech and Jalis Hammers
---
------------------------
---
Raids:
---
- CC Scrapper Healer: Do an endless onslaught of CC to achieve perma superspeed, keeping up 3 seperate regeneration heals on you and your group at the same time. Plus additional direct heals. The CC just wrecks any breakbar
---
It depends on what you're doing, in my case it was entirely worth it cause I was just doing some casual map completion and I was just getting insanely annoyed by all the micro stutter.
---
What I was trying to say is that currently this wrapper is simply really situational, it can be a massive help for some situations but also a major problem for other situations. But saying that the wrapper "doesn't improve performance in any helpful manner" simply isn't true.  
---
Only issue I really noticed ingame was that certain textures (mostly textures on trees) didn't have their alpha channel. So in my case it did improve the performance of the game in a very helpful manner
---
If only my sister liked to play pc games...  
---
Over 100 keys to get the exalted shoulders, 75 keys didn't get iron beast greatsword ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Hitman: Codename Commander
---
The thing about this game is that you can at any point leave the game for a day, week, month or year and then come back and your gear will still be valid (you might have to change the stats but that takes like 5 min) and the content will still be there and still valid. Ofc you might have to buy expacs if they comes out and if you want the free season chapters and maps you have to log in during this times to the game and accept the story content. And then it is yours forever. 
---
I have this wall of text about the endgame that i paste to people thinking about it. But it was just posted a day back so i give you a link to that post. It is full of info and videos about GW2 and endgame. https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ame6mg/hype_me_up_about_this_game/eflboec/?context=0
---
No, Medium (esp in WvsW) and not Low is indicative of normal gameplay. 
---
Got my younger sister playing a few months ago (less than a year, but probably over 6 months). For most of it she barely played, but over the last 2-3 weeks she has gone from like the mid-20s to level 80, and is about to start the level 80 story.
---
I probably opened a lot more than that, and have yet to see a single contract.
---
If content can be low-manned with no problems that means that a lot of non meta builds will work with a full group. Your options are endless as long as the build makes at least some sense.
---
The issue was never a issue for over 6 years. It became a issue recently and why people are reacting. 
---
It is also not helping that Arena Net is not adressing the issue and letting us know if this will stay in game or if it is something they are working on.
---
You can max out the crafting fine, but keep in mind you won't be able to purchase anything other than the raw materials. So you'll have to buy Basic materials like Ores, Logs, etc and also the Fine materials like Fangs, Bones, Venom, etc.
---
The GW2crafts.net guide will occasionally tell you to buy a crafted component like an insignia or piece. You won't be able to buy those, so whenever the guide tells you go buy it, you'll have to find out how to craft that component from the raw materials, buy those materials and craft those, then continue. It gets bit of a hassle, yeah.
---
"hey you".. Typical starter between siblings
---
It's ok Larry one day the 2 devs working on it will get it done :) 
---
Maybe not a great programmer, but at least a person who graps the basic fundamentals of programming which is still better than letting someone entirely clueless trying to code.
---
I've been in a bit of a mood for some of the weirdest, possibly quite fucked builds, but I do remember those early days of HoT and the raiding scene where shit was being tested out. Curiosity got the better of me ever since I made this [horrible bastardization of core+LwS2 only condi bannerslave](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vJAQJAscjMdQlHW7BefAnIGmCsbAGAGZZJYE0C0gQMYCA-jxRAABYr8Ta9AXqEEgTAg1q/0xDAon9HIFAMLrA-e)
---
Diviner fb has better dps than diviner renegade.
---
Heals on renegade are higher than on fb.
---
The only advantage that heal fb has is tons of utility through defensive boons, but you can also just outheal everything as renegade and sacrifice some dps for same utility on dps fb.
---
...and drink plenty of water!
---
**HAIL HYDRA**tion
---
Sadly doesnt have adrenaline mushroom yet
---
Also, not saying you should drop all defence if you're just in open world. Play what is comfortable for you as long as its not group content that demands a bit more. Try swapping out for the more glasscannon builds as you play more and get better
---
you are supposed to look before posting an item, sorry, don't push an issue with yourself to someone elses responsibility
---
GuildWars must be the game where you can enjoy everything you do. And if you dont enjoy that you just can do another stuff you like and will be worth anyways.
---
It cost me 50 Black Lion Statuettes for a Golden BLCK

My understanding was always: zerker on both.
---
I'm too poor to try this. Awww
---
Oh yeah definitely. I do enjoy playing a bit off meta or dropping some things for personal preference at the cost of some damage in the sake of personal survivability or group utility on some classes, though I do wonder sometimes how much you can tweak a build into some weird obscurity that ends up like King Crimson from Jojo in a "I can't explain it, but it works" way.
---
I got it from my weekly key just as i got the Dragon glider a few weeks before that from a mapcompletion. I guess i am really lucky especially since i saw some video the other day from a guy doing 75 keys not getting the shoulders. I felt bad after watching that.
---
If you have no other fury source (common for fractals) you'll need to run axe for fire and staff for might. So it's axe/shield and staff.
---
Healing, Regen, prot is possible without mace. 
---
The dominator staff really reminds me of something that would be in HALO.
---
going on a limp here, but you probably can play a dps/support role made for pvp/wvw. It's a completely different build for any class in pve so at best you'll be able to play it subpar compared to someone with 100li. You'll also die to one shot mechanics you've never seen before. Unless you actually did some research on how each encounter works and even then there's a big difference between actually doing that encounter and theoretically understanding that encounter.
---
Im running around in pre-searing for that very reason. 
---
My favourite area in the game :3
---
You clearly dont see the importance of inducing visual diarrhea to your enemies.
---
My mother always liked watching me playing GW2. I've asked her every time when she was sitting next to me, asking questions about everything in the game, if she wanted to give it a try. She always said no because she was afraid of "destroying my character". xD
---
When I moved to another country, she wanted to surprise me and find me ingame. Thing was, she didn't even remember the game title or my characters name. So she asked all of my friends behind my back if someone could show her how to do it. 
---
Long Story short... One of my friends took some time to help her creating an account and showed her around a bit ingame. He even went out of his way to update some hardware parts in her old PC, that she could play it smoothly. We had an guild event planned one Sunday, to do some missions and dungeons together. The friend of mine asked me, if he could bring "a friend" as well. Needless to say that I was a bit speechless when I've heard my mothers voice in Discord. :D
---
By then, she was already playing for four weeks almost daily. Just because she wanted to make sure that she is "good enough" to play with us. She is still playing today, mostly roaming around Queens Dale and helping out the farmers wherever she can. Her favorite thing is the Ale escort event through the swamp area. Her reasoning behind it: "Those poor soldiers need their beer!" :D
---
I have a small guild group that is generally not that tryhard for fractals and ever since i started playing Minstrel Heal Firebrand we clear cms daily and even got lnhb a few days ago.
---
Well recently...it is around for almost a year or two.
---
Look, this comp without a healer doesn't work for LFG. How many groups have you ever seen phasing a boss in 5 seconds? You have to still run a dedicated healer, be it the FB or Ren (who needs harrier, GL with that), and you still need spirits and banner, your total boon uptime is also lower since no Chrono extending boons, the comp is just less flexible for LFG. Sure it's great if you have a static who has gear can phase like [dT], but for regular LFG, Chrono druid just works and is quite safe doing so. 
---
Ah yes, the classic three line fake. 
---
That is so. bloody. cute. 
---
dps firebrand + heal rene works for my static. firebrand is full zerker though as far as i know
---
you run sand savant on dps scourge? you run condi scourge at sloth? man i think you confuse support scourge and dps scourge, they aren't the same build with the same functionality: barrier scales off healing power which dps has none of basically..where is that 6k coming from? and want carry at sloth cuz people facetank coconuts? take a thief lol
---
i'm not fighting for anybody, you just assume that because i care about people not spewing nonsensical and wrong things..not sure what data i provided that was wrong "numerous times"?
---
herald and scrapper are handkiters! see? the same level of usefulness as necro, at 1 boss! even better they can do river as well(albeit scrapper less so)
---
and those are elite specs not whole classes fwiw, renegade and holo see plenty of play and are meta not "viable"
---
Oh god, same though. I was legitimately mad that one didn't win. I'd take it over the Great sword any day!
---
Because that would be paying to win. I already don't like that gen 1 legendaries can be bought. Richs kids can just buy gems and convert them to gold, then buy the legendaries. Nothing is special about a legendary that can be bought. 
---
yea slightly better just like letting someone that has their single 1LI from escort do idk..dhuum?
---
How about my issue is that I craft legendaries for profit and time = money.  Time grinding dungeons is time that I'm missing out on gaining gifts of exploration.
---
I think my use case works just fine. 
---
Someone say Pharah? **JUSTICE RAINS FROM ABOVE** 
---
I say it's ok **IF** the picture is public, relevant watermarks are preserved, and the person reposting it doesn't claim to be the creator. Bonus it's ok points if the reposter links to the artist in the description or comments. As far as attracting work opportunities go it doesn't really matter who posted as long as they get credited. I don't think it takes away much from the original espescially since the creator might be on a different platform. Reposting in such cases would be more beneficial since you then have access to a different viewer base that might never have known. For example, if Auhana isn't on reddit I never would've seen this since I don't do DA. Reposting is worse for videos like on youtube because they take away from adsense. It's less of a problem for images since sites like instagram don't pay you. There is a case though for predatory reposting. Reposting on the same site, same day as the original, and only using the original reposter's name in the hashtags. I usually find these scummy cause instagram makes it so easy to tag the original artist.  
---
Commissioned work is a bit different. You'd have to assess those individually.  
---
That's just me though and my experience with artists. It's anecdotal and at the end of the day it's up to the artist.
---
This is the best story Ive read on reddit in ever!

“I want doubts without doubts"
---
My younger brother made me buy him the game over 4 years ago (it was on sale for 5$), so I bought it for both of us so we could play together.
---
He quit after a month and I use his character for daily rewards since then :/ 
---
I guess OP's problem is that it may affect them at some point. Or they just want to bring some attention to this because they care. 
---
&gt; As far as i get, mount can be obtained by 80 lvl character in first quests, than I can use it on every character on different servers and levels?
---
Servers only matter in WvW, so it will unlock on every character on your account.
---
&gt; I mean will i be able to use it on my 62 lvl thief or not?
---
You will.
---
&gt; And the second question on what class is better to use 80 lvl upgrade? 
---
*Really* depends what you enjoy. When you use your level 80 boost, you are moved to the Silverwastes to try it out and it doesn't become final until you leave. You can also go to the PvP lobby, which unlocks all your skills temporarily. 
---
&gt; hunter, engineer,necromancer and mesmer, so provably you can give a good advice on this classes
---
**Rangers**, necromancers and mesmers are all, to some extent, pet/summons professions. Rangers have a permanent pet that needs management, necromancers have long-duration summons and mesmers have very short duration summons. Engineers switch between different 'kits' and can use turrets, which makes them both very flexible and very complex. 
---
Who the F put queen on
---
Account bound progression (mounts and gliders/masteries in HoT) are account bound. You just need to unlock it in order to use it across all characters. Once you do the first story step in PoF on a level 80, you'll have access to your mount on all characters.
---
&gt; And the second question on what class is better to use 80 lvl upgrade?
---
This answer depends on who you ask. Leveling *used* to be a chore on certain classes, but currently the leveling process is pretty even difficulty-wise across all classes. Personally, I tell players to try to level the more mechanically intensive classes normally so that you get used to them (Engineer would certainly fit this area, some people would say Mesmer but I think Mes is pretty easy to grasp once you understand their shatter mechanic). Ranger and Necro are extremely easy to learn, so you may elect to skip the leveling process on them just to get the mount.
---
I applaud anytime I see people run stuff like heal scrapper 
---
You can get mount even on lower level if someone else starts the story and you join their group. Once unlocked you can use it on any character.
---
Boost will have no effect in pvp since everyone gets scaled to max level with everything unlocked. If you plan to join groups in wvw necro is the only choice with PoF, in small scale fights other 3 are quite strong, but considering that engi and mesmer aren't very beginner friendly I'd really not boost them immediately. 
---

new maps just dont give anything to veteran players,they dont  care about  new weapon sets since half of them have leg weapons,so they do all achivements in week and bb new map.

aight big brother goal: get sister into gw2

You can equip a mainhand weapon in one weapon set and leave the mainhand slot on the second set empty. Both weapon set will then use your mainhand of the first set. So equip axe/torch in one set and a pistol in the other set.

i've tried getting my older brother into it, but it didn't stick ;-;
---
Chit chat with your bros**™** in the locker room before sports is part of the game as much as having decent conversations with your squad is part of raiding, which is only one of the many reasons why the LFR is widely hated by people invested on WoW's raids and also one of the reasons people automatically despise the possibility of automated matchmakings here. Raiding is one of the most social activities in GW2, regardless of our personal feelings about the social part.
---
yea i can, but im new here so.... would like to be sure a dev can see it. 
---
Thats a start..

official forum for suggestions? can you link the url? thanks

Got exalted gloves and the shoulders from BLC's trough random map completions. Why cant i be this lucky in every game.

I think it is a combination of both. Maybe he was under her spell in the novel, but not in LW3. Jennah had to tell him twice to finally get out of his Seraph role and take over the pact so he can "find his own way... finally."
---
Thank you very much ! That is the kind of data I wanted to find :)
---
I am not too surprised if race doesn't matter for tool skins but I am absolutely certain there is a significant difference between asura mining and humanoid mining (4th strike vs waiting before 3rd strike).
---
Since tool skins are faster anyway I guess it doesn't matter too much anyway :)
---
I understand that, but you can, and should do that all the time while playing the game with someone, not just in raids.
---
how much degrees with the gpu with afterburner? might be thermal throttling
---
Is there any way to cancel an ability if you use it by accident? Most of the time it’s not a problem, but recently I’ve been accidentally healing when I’m still over 90%.
---
I tried looking in the TP yesterday to see around how much Ascended Gear is and nothing showed up, is all Ascended bound on acquire? If so then why even have a filter for it on the TP?

It's a club made from books. Not too effective and the quaestor will have your hide if he finds out what you did to his books.

Cool, thank you! Is torch favored over pistol or is it completely situational? Like when I use GS for farming, which to lose, the pistol or the torch.
---
if you're looking for a nice story I strongly advice you to do the whole C&amp;C precursor (be aware that the 2nd part is the usual mat sink, so it's quite expensive wood/leather wise).
---
The story is divided into 4 parts, which are imo pretty well done if you take time to enjoy it.
---
My motivation to play thunderhead has been massively diminished by that maps performance, I love the maps music, its aesthetic and its layout but I just cant get over the way it runs so bad.
---
Dragon's Stand is mostly simple too (though no reason to go there aside of the meta), and VB is mostly easy to traverse once you get a bit familiar with it, but TD can go f*** itself D: Got 100% completion, did Gerent 10+ times, I still hate to navigate it.

&gt; Necro in PoF cant be a "grim reaper"?

Don't play necro, but someone else here will be able to help you! I know that soulbeast is very strong, though.

That sounds like a tanky [holosmith](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Holosmith) from Path of Fire.

Possibly a [mirage](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mirage) from Path of Fire. 
---
&gt; how ranger works
---
In PvP, the soulbeast elite spec is very powerful but with a bit of a learning curve. Sic 'em in beast mode gives you a +40%ish damage buff (from memory), so you can be an amazing sniper. 
---
&gt; Are these clases in pof specialisations are ok in any mode? 
---
In open world play, anything goes. In raids and T4 fractals, people prefer specific builds (metabattle and snowcrows websites will help you with that). 
---
&gt; Is thrre an opportunity to try them all without wasting 80lvl upgraid or its either to create and level each to activate pvp lobby and look at the abbilities and passives in it?
---
You can create a low level character then go into the PvP lobby and try things out. 
---
Oh god lol can’t believe I bought 25 keys 
---
Not sure what i expected. Probably hazelnuts.
---
I know they had this friendships videos series going for a while but it would be hella cute if they could do a collective video on families brought together playing GW2 aswell. It's heart-warming to read about you and your mother!
---
If you can perform your role well with the class, you shouldn't have too many issues; that also depends on the lfgs you join though.
---
With that said, Necro can be a good addition to fractal groups but it also depends on the fractals themselves. Condi Scourge is a safe condi DPS class with great boonrip (huge plus for certain instabilities) and decent barrier uptime. Condi DPS with slow burst is less effective on most fractals due to boss phases, but in more casual groups it shouldn't be a problem.
---
Power Reaper is the Necro build a lot of players would recommend for fractals. It can boonrip, it's fairly tanky, it has plenty of CC. Other classes have higher DPS potential, but the added utility of boonrip and ease of play makes it a safe choice.
---
Support Scourge is a great pick for fractals. The great thing about barrier is that its effectiveness isn't mitigated by agony like healing is. That means that if you're barrier-ing at the right time, your party could safely tank some attacks without care. It has decent DPS for a support class, one of the best rezzing capabilities, great CC and still is capable of great boon rip. Its healing isn't as bursty as other support classes, between perma-life siphon, barrier and *potentially* traited wells, you have access to a low-ish cooldown aoe heal, high prot uptime with wells, regular condition cleanse and regular barrier application. Scourge does struggle with boon application, but it can at least provide around 20 stacks of might and regular prot application. If you have a soulbeast that can take frost spirit, you'll find that you have a great support class that can carry groups through some rough fractals.

Almost noone explains it ever because it's pretty straight forward and self-explanatory. It's easier than Tarir. But sometimes people can't figure out that red=bad, that you should probably kill the mobs that spawn or that reading the meta's description on the top right of the ui might tell them exactly what to do.

Me :
---
- Yeah new episode is out !

- Finishes story (2 days)
---
- Do some achievements (2-3 weeks)
---
- Gets bored 
---
- Yay Festival ! (3 weeks)
---
- Wait (??? months)
---
- Repeat.
---
Honestly I'd say FB is the better healer in terms of keeping the squad alive IMO. But in terms of efficiency running a Heal Rev + Diviner FB is so much stronger for fractals.
---
Instructions unclear, became proprietor of an ice cream parlor.
---
For farming, greatsword is king because of the disco lasers. Honestly, whichever you prefer. 
---
I like torch because it has AoE burning when traited with The Pledge from the Illusions line, but pistol does decent bleed damage when traited and has an interrupt. 
---
The combat and wardrobe options mostly.  Also no sub fee, so I can come back any time and still play around.  One thing I still like about WoW is how it runs on my PC.  Much better compared to GW2.
---
I used to take it into Fractals too when the grandmaster of Scrapper gave exploding Gyros a stunfield and superspeed. Sadly with that trait gone I have to utilize all the knockbacks with low cooldown for the new Grandmaster. Thus rendering it annoying in Fractals. Nobody wants their mobs pushed away.
---
Anet might need some form of bottom up innovation process. Some companies did well with allowing their employees some time to allocate to their pet projects and even company internal competitions to push excellent side stuff.
---
Then again, I don't know just how intensive their workload is. Plus innovation programmes might be more suited for larger corporations, though Arenanet is said to sit at 300 employees, which is certainly nothing to scoff at.

My static doesn't care about LI at this point because all of us own legendary armor. Definitely chill and attendance. Kills are just a bonus from getting together to have some fun.

dodge or esc
---
Hey! Just FYI, the chest armor OP wears only exists for norn characters so if you want to copy their look, you'll have to choose that race.
---
Other than that, you get most of the skins from playing the profession (revenant). The gloves are from a gemstore set, which means they're not available all the time (they aren't right now) and you can buy them with either gold or real money. The sword is a crafted item from last month's free story release.

What makes us so sure that there is something like good or evil when talking about the elder dragons? They are a force of nature, protecting the planet of total destruction. Yes, people die and get corrupted. But in the end they just absorb magic that would otherwise kill every living being on Tyria.
---
From the very beginning when Aurene was introduced, I was like "This will not work out as planned..." We just can't have an Elder Dragon on our side from a narrative point of view. Do people even realize what this would mean for the GW2 story going forward? And even if this would work, what would we do after? One domain of magic is covered by a friendly Elder Dragon. Only five more to go. And our ED can't fight against the other dragons because there must be a reason why there were six in the first place. When the death of another ED without replacement destroys Tyria, how do we replace the others? Just hope that we find another dragon that fights on our side? Because when Aurene could just become an ED, kill Kralk, Primordus, Jormag and Steve and replace ALL of them, the whole story would fall apart. Why is Kralk not going to the fire ring and the far shiverpeaks just to kill Primordus and Jormag? Both are back to sleep and, if this would really be an option, the easiest way to get more magic/power over fire and ice.
---
The whole story would immediately end if we had an ED on our side, who can replace every other ED at once. Especially because we know that the elder dragons are not friends with each other and it is hard to believe that non of them ever tried to overtake all of them.
---
Never looked at it like that, and now I'm unsure what to do with this information.  
---
What would good attendance and competence sound like?
---
Honestly if the map had been as much fun as Sandswept or Jahai I'd be pretty bummed out... but the map and base episode achievements were such a comparative pain in the ass to complete that after hitting one timegate too many (having time to do the daily catacombs puzzle but hitting a mandatory 20 minute wait on ghosts) I updated Warframe and have plenty to do there.  
---
I'm fine with fractals and weekly guild missions and raid training until new content drops.

Monopoly is a *terrible* game. The winning strategy - buying all the houses and refusing to upgrade to hotels (there's a by-rule that states that no more houses can be purchased if the bank runs out), and then bleeding every other player dry very slowly - is boring for everybody involved. There are literally hundreds of better board and card games out there. Board games have seen somewhat of a renaissance in recent years.

Wait, the increase is only 12%? Doesn’t seem all that significant for how often people recommend it. Or is it simply for the Agony resistance slot?

HoT did get another back other than the 3 order backs, but it was a separate collection for the Exalted back, and it has a glider, but it's a gemstore purchase.

There are many different doubts they could have used. They don't have to undermine the Charr racial traditions (or the Norn for that matter) in order to show character growth.

This is seriously one of the best video game stories ever told. Brought tears to my eyes

Nah, as a good commander, even with the events we've been through, i went back to my daily routine. As usual between big events. So, if anybody is looking for me, i'll be harvesting some nodes, somewhere in Tyria. Or taming a branded hydra in the desert. Or opening very important red mails. Very, very classified mails.

Caithe succeeded to find me last time, by simply sending a mail. I guess it's a good option.

Keybind weapon stow. It's used by better players in pvp/wvw for skill baiting, but can be used in pve as well to cancel.

No. Question is: Could reshade maked to work with it?
---
I already have an imgui patch, as a sample of how to make some of the things work, but reshade is not only imgui problem.
---
So answer on both is: only reshade maintainers/authors can make it work both in terms of compatibility and loading.
---
Tori Black.
---
But why male models?
---
I'd say you don't really need the AR on maces, at least on most cases/fractals, you'll be on M/M set for a really short time, basically just F1 &gt; #3 &gt; #5 and swap back to Axe to keep dpsing, exotics should be fine.

I don't remember about damaging, but Balthazar sucked magic out of both and got stronger.

To be honest, I like the idea that they have these shiny relics that can channel mystical magic and their thought process is still:
---
It's a big stick. I can hit people over the head with it until they die.
---
Actually you are not factoring in the free 50 relics that you get from getting the infusion every 1-3 days or the 20-use ascended salvage kit (valued at 20g) for a meager 25 relics.
---
Passively it keeps constantly accruing and to some that is wonderful. I myself got this relatively cheaply and it is genuinely one of my favourite use items in the game. I don't like the idea of burning myself out on content so I choose to not do fotm runs daily. This supplements that ideology nicely.
---
To each their own.
---
intet truly has awesome art. imo intet is also the best fit for vlast from the dragons i care about
---
Always chill above all. You def don't want it to be a bad experience. Competence can be learned, so i'd probs couple it with good attendance
---
i still despise it, the maps are a mess, the masteries take too long to unlock, there is no new major town (fits for the setting/story but was still a disappointment for an expansion). Half of the content is locked behind meta's and events and you're forced to play with others to do most of the stuff.
---
&gt;!You remember how Eir, Glint and some other \_dead\_ characters are all fine and dandy in the Mists? Our Dragon Full of Crystals is in there now as well. With our inter-dimensional Kralkatorrik being active in both worlds, Aurene will help us fight off Kralkatorrik from the other side.!&lt;

Go see the latest How To Train Your Dragon movie while constantly disturbed by thoughts of the people who would get their rocks off to something so innocent.
---
Been playing GW2 off and on since launch. My sister picked it up a few months back and is probably going to beat me to getting her first legendary. 
---
I'm too casual for my own good.
---
I've never played Wow. But I think I'll never do it. Guild Wars 2 is a 'casual' MMO. You can leave the game for months and come back later to find that your build still works. And Legendary equipment is no necessary, it has the same stats as Ascended equipment but with a cooler skin and you can change the stats type.
---
Also, World vs world is unique. True, anet has send it to oblivion and are only focused on story/pve content, but nevertheless it's quite fun. I enjoy both going with the public tag or simply roaming with friends.
---
It's a game that you can play for fun, instead of having to work to be able to play, like the majority of MMOs.
---
I recommend the game to all my friends that like MMOs but don't have the time for them ;)
---
I’ve maxed a couple of crafting disciplines on my f2p alt, definitely possible. You just have to know how crafting works and what gives experience. Like what other posters have said gw2crafts is a good resource but be ready to make some substitutions and craft everything yourself.
---
Too bad herald sucks in PvE.
---
I think it's even meta now but... Power Quickness Firebrand.
---
I play spell breaker DPS in both fractals and raids. It works, just very hard to beat some classes
---
Just dont get them. It sounds stupid but why try to find other ways to support this stupid system? Hopefully soon enough more ppl join this and stop feeding a bad system.
---
My triangle:
---
- Panicking that people'll force me to do greens on dhuum (certain death due to my depth perception?)
---
- Do I rezz or let my rotation go undisturbed
---
- Everyone else is at 37k dps and I'm a 25k pug :(
---
I really would like a static _sigh_
---
That achievement requires grinding a ton of level 80s though. Like it's insane. 
---
No, this happens out in the open world at times when there are no special actions.
---
But it's so cheap compared to ascended crafting. I'd rather not spend 100 gold for two maces that I use only for CC. 
---
As long as you're working on it, you'll get there. Getting your crafting up is worthwhile for ascended gear. If you have access to the Living World S3 maps, you can get ascended trinkets quite quickly as each map has vendors and a farmable currency. 
---
For stats, the order of most-to least is amulet &gt; chest &gt; weapons &gt; ring &gt; earring &gt; legs &gt; head &gt; back &gt; boots/gloves/shoulders.
---
Amulets give you the most bang for your buck and rings are quite easy to get hold of. It's absolutely worth doing the elite spec weapon collections. 
---
There are several crafting recipes under "ectoplasmic refinement" (crafting level 450) that are time-gated, meaning you can only craft them once a day. It's worth crafting one of each of them every day, even if you don't craft anything else so you'll have a stack of them to use when you want to craft ascended gear.
---
Such a nice story
---
Ik don't necesarilly want to try and get around it just very interesting how my fashion wars is now a bit hammstrung by my country tackling these systems. Anyway Maybe that's for the better
---
Have fun with boon overload+ afflicted Artsariv with pugs.
---
Thank you, I was starting to think no one else knew what I'm talking about!
---
True. Seeing her spending all that time in Queens Dale just because she likes it, even tho it would be more effective to run higher level maps, reminded me to take MMO's less serious when it comes to progress. This, and the fact that lot's of friends and guild members burned out just because they only looked for efficiency and not fun.
---
Yes it does!
---
i asked for a week to jerk off. /s
---
If that's legitly what was running in your mind throughout the movie, then I'd argue that you have more issues than the imaginary people you get disturbed by.
---
happened to me 3 times selling fast 250 butter stack. 
---
i opened a ticket. never got an answer.
---
u can reproduce it easily : just sell a stack and fastest as u can another one till u get the whole stack priced weird. 
---
i learned to put things on ah very very slowly after that
---
Which Region do you play on?
---
I could get you into fractals. For now you shouldnt worry about crafting any Maces, Like if you are playing fractals you most likely will get one dropped till you need one :D 
---
Really wish we just banned people that suggest these websites.
---
I'm finding it harder to log in these days. I feel like I do the same stuff, daily/map stuff, fractals, and then that's it. I don't have much interest in raiding so I'm not sure what else there is in the game for me. 
---
https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*-cX-9NhVa8nSx2pW
---
not really, i still have a lot of stuff to work on including the dragonsblood weapons that i want (basically all of them, ascended included), so I'm still preoccupied running the metas getting jewels and waiting for the bugs to be resolved on the bugged ascended tales achieves.
---
also finally got around to getting all of my null sigils for last episodes armor.  after finishing up on the armor i'll jump back onto running AB to get the mats i need for the auric weapons collection to finish up on my luminate's backplate.
---
Google "GW2 crafting guide" and just follow it through. It's full by it does the job. 
---
Bitterfrost Frontier and Draconis Mons are both very easy to farm and should get you about 5 ascended bits with a minimum of effort and a bit of tedium. 
---
Man that is sweet. Also imagine doing the same escort mission for other reasons than XP or some type of farming. I see them as menial tasks sometimes (depends which escort though) but she adds a little fantasy and makes it sound so wholesome.
---
Puts things into perspective on how you can play gw2. 
---
I see you are a person of taste.
---
WvW sparked my interest in Gw2.
---
Now i do nothing else
---
Does the FPS change from when you are at max settings to all low? Just curious. 
---
But also, not that it's ideal but have you tried completely reformatting your PC? It could be due to some corrupt driver or something have you tried using DDU to completely remove all drivers and re-install them
---
now you know how people who dont care about story feel all the time 
---
I've played WvW and 9/10 it's go here, capture, go here, kill, go here, etc, etc. Rinse repeat.
---
Supply and demand.
---
I joined the GW adventure after the first GW1 beta.  
---
I've since played GW1 and GW2 mostly alone.  
---
But 10 years ago my girlfriend joined me on the adventure.  
---
A bit later her mother also joined us, and she's now our guild leader and go-to-pro when we've got questions heh.  
---
Do IT!
---
also, what's the issue with there sites? Never had an issue and don't see the issue. 
---
I'd take 1 person being feared away instead of the 10 people I saw today, multiple times
---
Thank you SO much for taking the time to write all this out for me I really appreciate it!
---
Your last paragraph is why I like the name so much
---
I didn’t put in a buy order at that price.  You can’t skip buy orders. The top order fills and is refunded the gold difference.
---
When I was sold 16 for 2c, 22+ Gold was also in the collection box.  I took the screenshot after I had already collected it so that context is missing.  I only thought about posting after I had already collected.
---
Hmm, ok. I’ll give it another try when I’m done with the story. Thanks.
---
I'm not saying back armor skins are irrelevant,  I only said glider skins are irrelevant.  PoF gave us back armor skin collections already.  The Joko skin, the Sunspear skin, and two more I can't think of right now.  Just like HoT did, these were given through story progression with achievements available to "upgrade" to an ascended variant.
---
Started out with a warrior, which is still fun... But somehow necro became my favorite class. I like the sustain and support. Plus warrior in wvw is kinda pointless now ):
---
I had forgotten about this! Now I have to start repressing those memories all over again...
---
Cdkeys is not an official retailer and has a known history of selling fraudulently purchased keys, resulting in the buyer losing their account. The risk is too high to recommend it in good faith. 
---
For some reason I thought the season was done, so I just chewed through episodes 1-5. Now I'm stuck at this cliffhanger, waiting. Oops. Lol
---
There is a joke to be had here...
---
I play GW2 since Beta and it is just normal to become blind for the little things over time. But if you just stop for a second and listen to NPC dialogue before and after an event, you don't even need to add your own fantasy to it. It is actually really amazing how much effort Arena Net did put into the core game already. Only sad thing is, that Arena Net is not interested in updating older content outside of bugfixes. Still waiting for the vanilla overhaul tbh. :)
---
Oooh lovely.
---
Y'know I only have the reliquary because I accidentally ate the 1000g item and figured I may as well do the rest, but when it poops out a Gift of Ascension it feels pretty great to have one.
---
That's what you get for using the lost precipice as a Guild Hall...
---
I really wish they did more on this front. Less emphasis on new maps and more on story.
---
That is actually what i run on my dd, it just feels heavier than the rest of staves. 
---
you mean run and escape ?
---
I'm NOT watching this. Nope!
---
Huh! I dd not know that. Bought a couple of gem cards off them previously without issue, but perhaps I have just been lucky so far. 
---
Checked the local supplier list on ArenaNet official website however and none work for UK and even ArenaNet own website doesn't work (see link in my other post) so not surprising some people choose to risk it. 
---
When all irrelevant content is finally gone and we only have a button that buys a blc key and opens the chest immediately. 
---
Np. You should know that all gear in PvP is standardized and you can freely select any stats. Also PvP and WvW builds are very different compared to PvE.
---
To be fair. The AAAAHHHHH thing was just a bit of fun. And people seemed to enjoy the absurdity of it. It's our meme and we embrace it.  
---
I also know someone who saw the picture and thought it was a bit of a laugh and has since bought both expansions 
---
1.  Idk man, like dude, where's my car? 
---
2.  Medium Rare. 
---
3.  Probably Guardian. 
---
4.  Pick a T2/T3 for your TZ (research). 
---
5.  Cosmetic endgame vs. supply &amp; demand. ZzZzzzZ
---
6.  Whatever you've got the hots for. 
---
7.  It isn't, don't be a tool. 
---
8.  We have standards here.  Get creative. 
---
9.  Nah man.  You can figure it out.  I have faith in you. **^/s**
---
Long time returning player (~5 years). How's the state of WvW? Used to be part of a T1 server. 
---
How many veteran players have you just informed
---
So, if I'm reading it right, any new armor item I use it on in the future will cost me 1 transmutation charge, correct? 
---
I think I had in my mind that if it was an unlock-able kind of thing it would be similar to the dyes, and how after being unlocked they're free to use whenever at no charge.
---
New-ish player here trying to get better at the game.
---
I'm playing a Condi Banner Warrior, and I'm trying to wrap my head around weapon stowing. I get that it's supposed to happen before Longbow F1 but do I like...need to wait for the animation to play out? Why doesn't it matter if you used Blood Reckoning beforehand? I don't really get all the details, if anyone could elaborate, thanks.
---
TL;DR: How do I weaponstow as Condi Berserker properly?
---
This is what the wiki states:
---
&gt;There is an intermittent energy beam that will shooting out from the center area of the lowest level as a red beam, and a few seconds later return down as a blue beam. The red beam causes [Burning](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Burning) damage, while the blue beam does [Chilled](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chilled) damage.
---
Even tho it doesn't really spells it out, but sounds like an magic exchange. I was just assuming that the chill damage from Jormag is damaging Primordus. Can't find any confirmation on the wiki tho.
---
Content is already going, there's barely any devs on non-story content.
---
Well they don't need to worry about me specifically because I quit since raiding is dead
---
That's a lot of mixed answers 
---
oh fuck off really
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?
---
Due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator+subreddit%3Aguildwars2&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).

---
Hopefully get more Belgiums..
---
Medic Warrior... it's not that bad
---
You gotta play in UTC, and get rid of the daylight saving time change.
---
In ideal situation you want your crit chance to max out. Depending on if you play alone or with other people, this will be easier to get or not. Fury gives 20% for example, sigil of accuracy gives 7 etc. If you have teammates they can give you even more stuff to make it easier to cap it out, such as warrior banner or spotter from a ranger. Since you said mostly some solo pve content id assume a mix of mainly some assassin would be nicer. Just check your crit chance, add 20% from fury and try to get that to atleast 75% in total id say.
---
You weren’t praising it, so you are essentially talking shit. And this Reddit hates you for that. 
---
To some extent yes. However with any game, they actually create the experience, not leave you on your own to write your own story. Games are an effective storytelling medium because they don't force you to imagine everything, they actually create the stuff, and make it fun. 
---
Nothing like seeing a porn scene while at work. Thanks. :/
---
Mods, perhaps an NSFW tag?
---
This sounds oddly like the plot of another something or other.
---
Having played 3 days at launch doesnt make you a vetetan, just another casual player that played few days and left.
---
1) is it worth keep playing wow, sro, rf online, dota 2...? Depends if you enjoy the gsme or not, just try it and decide (most people here will tell you yes, but its upon you)
---
2) there is no football in tyria, so idk what size are you tslking about, but if you consider bith na and eu and every server... It csn easily make like 10.000 keg brawls games at a time (maybe im short)
---
3) ask thanos if his rol is available... You want everything
---
4) unless you play wvw, the server doesnt matter
---
5) na/eu and chinesse servers are separated... Jesus they even sell legendaries at chinesse gemstore, consider the imbalance if we can trade with them... Also they are so expensive cause they are the endgame goal, not every rooky should afford them. 
---
6) no warlocks here, wrong game? 
---
7) dont know if trolling or... But you cant get both for 2$, no p2w, only buy to play, you can get EVERYTHING but normal game currency (even there are many items that you only get with ingame bound currency, even if you spend 10k$ you wont get it..) 
---
8) cause many people are retard and get offended with any name, but there are some names that should be avoided
---
9) make a new toon and l2p, there is a lot of "visual tip" while you plsy and growth you character (oh, and reading what does every skill and trait also helps) 
---
Welcome back, hope you last more than 3 days...
---
We could call the golem "Annihilator" or something.
---
Best troll noob post 10/10.
---
Why is it trash? Fits with chrono really well, also Funerary weapons and Aurora. It was KP well spent for me.
---
GW2 is definitely one of those player-driven games more so than quest or raid driven. You have to make your own goals, then see them through. I'll go ahead and give you a quick list of things I like to do:
---
- Craft. Get 500 in whatever you want and make ascended gear. Why not have the best there is, it's shiny! Plus it's account bound so you don't have to stick to one class.
---
- Story. Start at personal, and complete it in order all the way to the newest release! I am currently on Act IV of HoT, and it is really fun listening to what's going on.
---
- Legendaries! There are a ton, pick one and see it through. Gen 1 are going to be easier, but Gen 2 are going to be more fun. 
---
- Check out other things to do. Why not try raiding? Get into some WvW zergs or go roam and see how it feels. And PvP, sure it might be tough at first but give it a few games. 
---
- Take a break. Video games are there for entertainment and fun, if you aren't having fun, stop for a while, and come back in a week or so and see if that spark is back. Or try another game, mix it up a bit. 
---
fake and gay
---
ugh "throws up"
---
Honestly, sounds like you just burnt out. Nothing wrong with that. 
---
Just take a break, play some other games. GW2 will always be here.
---
Weeeeeeeell, I'll really have to belive you on your word here.
---
But regardless, red infusions isn't sellable, and even if it was, I really doubt it would go over 50g, being pretty easily obtainable in multiple ways. And blue one is still over 650g
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Power_DPS this is the fractal one im using. i just did a couple fractals with moa stance instead of the frost spirit and it definitely felt better. 
---
for open world i use https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Power_Greatsword this with bear stance 
---
It is people who want to get shit done. Like gather up, sub 3hr fullclear, never meet with the others for the rest of the week. 
---
&gt;see how your DD get on
---
Well I'd expect pretty well since I'm the .1%.
---
The entirety of your comment is in such broken English I can't tell what point you're trying to make.
---
1) No, give it another 3-4 minutes to let it brown off.
---
2) The game is decently popular in America, so the size of an average american (give or take a few Finnish guys)
---
3) Upper Middle
---
4) Janice, she always sneaks in a few free refills if you're nice.
---
5) There's no chinese server, you're thinking of ancient mesopotamia
---
6) 100m Sprint
---
7) On a scale of 1-10: About 7 past 3 in the afternoon.
---
8) It's for roleplay purposes, Nazis love Hitler, so just call your character Big Jugs Loli Hitler and it'll be fine.
---
9) Read this post again while playing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WPCLda_erI) in the background.
---
10) Wow.
---
11) That's quality armor.
---
12) Thanks!
---
13) Take a look!
---
while I know you chose purple to match the saber. 
---
Glints primary colors were always geared towards blues so I feel like it’s really missing those bright blinding teal colors 
---
Break stun is only on Guard
---
Stab can be corrupt into fear
---
With the spoiler tag was expecting something *different*
---
Excuse my ignorance. What do you mean by BS??
---
Heal renegade is stronger. The firebrand can focus on offense 
---
I want that staff! No luck with RNG tho and its so pricey 
---
Never resubmit. Any ticket you submit has to be for entirely different unrelated issues. Resubmitting tickets on the same issue just adds to the backlog and makes things worse.
---
Personally, I contacted support about refunding an item I was eligible to get but didn't loot, and got a response the next day.
---
hey, ive made a thread about that a few weeks ago. you can check it out here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/akdj0p/fractals\_core\_warrior\_bs\_with\_phalanx\_strength/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/akdj0p/fractals_core_warrior_bs_with_phalanx_strength/)
---
note that you dont need the 100% boon duration from Diviner stats, thats just optional, though the runes are mandatory
---
I did notice an FPS increase but I think mainly because its not completely drawing and rendering everything. Foliage in the trees were flat and square (at least the high trees in WvW) and there were graphical anomalies in the bushes, although he did say to expect these.
---
I lose about 5 to 10 frames on dx9+GW2Hook but I can deal with it.  I'm not quite sold on this dx12 thing yet. 
---
Its always Meatoberfest
---
I guess if you want to be glass go for asassjns and zerk mix. 
---
Uhhhh I enjoy chrono better than mirage. 
---
However. A lot of your purpose is lost if you Aren’t using shield as one of your weapon slots. Even as a dps chronos purpose is to bolster your allies and make them stronger so that your damage will increase in turn. 
---
That's kind of impossible for some reason, Not many people interested in MMORPG's other than Japanese and Koreans.
---
Bladed armor 
---
I never open keys except the very odd one from map completion and got the shoulders. I didn't even know they were in rotation. Don't do loot boxes, kids.
---
I've almost burned out last year with my legendary collection. For whatever reason I've decided to finish my first legendary in over 5 years of GW2 and worked on nothing else for weeks. Maybe not in the most efficient way possible, but I reached the point of pure hate for certain things near the end of my "journey"... I've completed the last gift, flushed everything in the mystic toilette, equipped my newly obtained Bifrost and logged out for almost 3 months.
---
Never going to do that again... If I can't reach something with the way I enjoy to play that game, I won't bother with it at all. As much as I like the legendary armor or some other legendary weapons... It's just not worth the effort for me.
---
To answer both of your replies, stick to whatever you feel comfortable with for Fractals. I tend to use more selfish builds when pugging, and take more supportive traits and utilities when grouped with guildies or if another Ranger isn't using it (like Spotter, Spirits, etc.). You don't have to go full support but losing that extra might from Vulture Stance for increase damage for your whole group is going to be way better.
---
As for merging with pets, I find keeping my pet out for trash, break bars, and during downtime when your burst is on cooldown. The bonus from merging isn't worthwhile when you aren't bursting, because pets like Smokescale can deal an insane amount of damage while also being able to tank hits. Honestly though, just make sure you are merged with your pet for Strength of the Pack and Worldly Impact, and you stay merged all the way through your burst to maximize that bonus.
---
Nice
---
Damn, you need to check the problem, because that is too much.
---
Chronomancer and heal scourge. 
---
Followed by firebrand, Druid, and herald 
---
I think the fact that its not sellable makes it more valuable. Some rando can just grind Istan for 1-2 week and get the Blue Celestial without even doing fractals. While Red Celestial is rare enough that it needs some dedication in 100CM IMO.
---
Heal scourge
---
I'm finding that the "idea" of playing GW2 a lot more exciting than actually playing the game right now. 
---
I'm really not in the mood to debate right now, so I apologize.  I might get back to you later about this though.
---
Xoxo -  "L'homme Mauvais"
---
Logan chose the queen over Tyria. What an absolute beta.
---
Ya...that's why I'm having a hard time picking. I feel like chrono doesn't fit my style I guess. I was even thi king of not doing mirage or chrono at all and go full dueling/illusions/domination
---
Except that rhytlock has always been kind of anti-charr with his behaviors and so have several other charr throughout the franchise. 
---
Same with all races tbh. The definable characters are always outliers. 
---
And him having self doubts is what made him strong in the first place, not his traditions. If he followed the charr traditions and didn’t deviate he wouldn’t have ended up with Sohothin in the first place. 
---
Of course, but I've been waiting for more than 3 weeks at this point. Certainly doesn't seem like they'll respond.
---
[here](https://i.imgur.com/f0uBjsx.png)
---
Yeah on the bright side I’m pretty big on data analysis so the making charts and spreadsheets part of it is actually fun for me but once it came time to do it I was like I don’t actually want to spend my time doing this is was just fun to optimize the route I would have way more fun playing a few games of pvp or doing a raid or something, but by the time my brain goes you’re not having fun doing this I’ve already burnt out to the point I won’t even have fun doing those things. 
---
"Jk pick one."
---
Do you happen to have a g-sync display and multiple monitors? If so try disabling g-sync and testing that. 
---
Without the potion and 0% BD you're actually already very close. I'd shoot for about 20-40% BD.
---
That's amazing.
---
Those adventurer scarfs from dry top, with or without the goggles 
---
I hope more countries join and force a change, to be honest. Better in the long run. 
---
*AAAAHHHHHH!*
---
I’m not gonna say that I liked the friendship campaign, but it’s probably worth noting that the advert campaigns aren’t really targeted at players generally.  Except in the case of new expac or upselling to returning players.
---
However cringe it was, I think that particular campaign was targeted at people who never downloaded the game.
---
Aww... I kinda wanna see if I can find her now, just to say, "Your daughter told us all about how you got into playing the game!"
---
acorns.
---
Damn, that's such an unexpected outcome... :S

Dominator Staff is awesome.  I got it when it first came out and have been using it on my Rev ever since.

BioShock 2 is leaking *pun intended*
---
Is there an option in the bios to disable integrated graphics?  Just curious, my cpu doesn't have integrated graphics so I don't know how it works.
---
Someone was just complaining in the Desolation map on NA yesterday that the inability to disable hearts showing on maps after you've done them once was in *desperate* need of a hotfix since it's so annoying. Like that?
---
ArenaNet just launched [another marketing campaign](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/guild-wars-2-friendships-2019/), which is a repeat of last year's Friend/Ships campaign. We got some cool stories from last year, but also [this little firestorm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/84foq3/anet_marketing_needs_to_do_better_research/). This is also in consideration of the past campaigns which were either awkward, or outright fumbles.
---
Meme aside, I do hope for the best.
---
Play ele. It’s more fun. 
---
Friendships are fine, Taimi is not.  No more stupid characters like Taimi please.
---
This is pretty normal for a-net sadly.
---
There have pretty much always been ppl complaining about the suppport times.
---
My friends have developed the term "guildwars apology." I've been a fan of the game for a long time, going on nerd rants on plenty of occasions, and it was frequently disregarded. Eventually my friends came around and played guild wars 2 and realized it was a great game, with that sense of "why didn't I get into this earlier?". Now anytime theres something someone has been harping on for a long time, and one of us discoveres, begrudgingly, that that person was right the whole time, we owe them a guild wars apology
---
wait so what you envision to be a "great dungeon" is to just stack n wack bosses? even more boring than bosses that has mechanics? 
---
Haha I could make a half assed guide about it if you don’t mind bad mic quality 
---
They are cheap. Easy to obtain.

Anyone downvoting this thread is an absolute menace. Melandru take you, earth consume you

There's someone who's about 65+ in my guild who loves helping new players and just doing world boss trains. She plays A LOT but very casually (she has motion issues so she can't do precise jumping or fast reflexes).
---
But damn do I am jealous of them (my parents don't know English and they do not enjoy games).
---
no just disappointed
---
You are right!! Taimi isn’t fine. Poor girl is getting worse and worse by the day. What is this Evon, you invest into unbreakable tools but you can’t invest into modern medicine?

i never used vulture stance, i used frost spirit and then tried moa stance when you mentioned it. 5% increase just doesnt seem like a lot. to take spotter what trait would you replace? im thinking marksman? 
---
so essentially dont be merged if your worldly impact is on cd?

What's hard to understand?  A lot of the time people have 0 idea what their steals do on various bosses. It is very common for a DD to join on sloth and not use their steal to clear conditions. I'm not talking about you specifically on DD, I'm referring to the pug that joins.

If I'm in a squad with 5 Dragonhunters, why is it such a big task for 1 to take some stability?

The other part is a joke that clearly went over your head. Are you saying you've never seen someone die before their mushroom is up and no one takes the initiative  to take it instead? And if they die, how do they cleanse anything?

It is kinda being praised too much. Since anet doesn’t know how hard to hit with the nerf-bat, key skills for 1v1 got trashed. Not fixed, trashed. Unless you can read your enemy very well, I wouldn’t force 1v1s on them

Came into this topic expecting it to be about the useless Pact Trade Cache in Thunderhead Peaks that only dispenses Daoud crates, which makes little sense. But your idea is nice too I guess.

Really smooth performance, congratulations on the hard work that the developers (ArenaNet) should have done in the first place. This is really some thing the community have been crying out for for years. understandably this is only in alpha and a few bumps are to be expected but i am currently getting a graphical glitch with trees where i am able to see the plain/mesh used for the leaves but this does not happen on all trees not sure if your aware or this is just happening with me. Also on the player select menu there seems to be a graphical glitch there too where the character portraits are missing eye balls or hair etc i will leave a link to images for a better understanding encase no one understands my dyslexia typing XD.  just though i would let you know. keep up the good work your all ready a legend for making this a reality as it is.

Got it in 16 - but bought 50 keys. Put aside ~£40 a month for gw2 which is fine by me. It's still probably 50p/hour a month which is just fine by me. I'm also sitting on 160 statuettes that I know I'm going to blow on a skin I'll use for 10 minutes (again).
---
As for trackpad: one of the best MMO raiding tanks/healers I've ever played with used a trackpad. Freaked me out to be honest.
---
What a beautiful exploitable meme format. Why didn't I think of this before?
---
I didn't listen to people and boosted a character as my first, ended up quitting the game because it didn't grab me. Well that's because I had no idea what I was doing, out in PoF just wandering around. 
---
Retried it 2 weeks ago and leveled a character, and I'm freaking hooked. So you should put that toon on pause and level a new character. This isn't like wow where you just want to get to end game.

My base MF is 320% (20% bonus from Achievement Point perks). Memories of Home (Lunar New Year buff) is 15%. Silverwaste gives 30%*5 (Perseverance)+ 50% (Vinewrath) =200%. You get an extra 50% during chest opening if you want to push it further.

I remember crunching the numbers at one point, using the effective power formula on MetaBattle and factoring in the traits I'd be using, boon uptime, different consumables and likelihood of getting buffs from other players (banners, spotter, spirits) and discovering that capping Critical Strike chance isn't always worth it if you're sacrificing too much Power to do it. You can go for a combo of Assassins and Berserkers gear, but the exact ratio that is ideal changes with your circumstances.

I should've said just gw2 then and not anet in general, my bad.

Just looking at reddit, there are many complaints about slow support in any given gw2 year :D

I'm in the middle of world completion on another character - the sheer amount of glitches and bad scaling in old maps is just staggering. Event steps not triggering, lack of interactable objects or insanely slow respawn times, things like that.

It's an account-wide permanent unlock. You can usually apply the skin to an armor piece without a cost the first time (if it's specifically a skin and not an armor piece or a weapon), but after that you'll need charges. I'd save it until you're level 80 since you'll be changing armor sets quickly as you level.

I somehow repeated my luck with the desert throne. Very last key I had or was willing to spend on it got me the shoulders. In total I think it was 30 keys. not as good as the 10 keys to get the throne but acceptable.

You stow to prevent [Aftercast](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aftercast_delay), and proper way to do it would follow [rotation](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/banner/), see notes.
---
5% increase per player is the main reason though, that's 25% bonus for party-wide damage. But if another Ranger is using it, then stick to Moa stance to basically have perma-every-boon. 
---
I use Marksmanship and Skirmishing for my pDPS-SB build, but I am also running Longbow instead of Sw/Axe because I just simply don't do melee too well. If another Ranger is using Spotter, then run a different trait line such as Beastmastery or Marksmanship for more personal power boosts. 
---
And for the merging, stay merged all the way through your burst. If you WI and still have another couple seconds in the burst window (boss isn't immune, almost dead, or you can get another quick rotation in), stay merged. Key thing is when you un-merge, it'll take your pet a second to kick in (like an aftercast) and you don't wanna lose that extra stats until you run outta steam. You'll kinda get a feel for it as you play, and also note that you are going to get a full rotation and burst in maybe 10% of the time, due to boss mechanics or bad PuGs. Just do your best to fit in key skills (WI, SotP, Sic 'Em) when you are ready for your burst. A player who is alive and pressing 1 is going to do more than a player who is dead.

That's all I keep getting in the "rare" ones when they pop up too. Literally the shit no one wants. Each weapon has like 10-15 buy orders. And that is *world wide* (well, EU/NA at least). They really do like to give you literal crap instead of something actually rare to make you want to gamble again.
---
lolz this thread is tons of information. and here i am, confused yet by HoT storyline. i only played main personal story, so killed zhaitan, but i never noticed where the egg came from, nothing really about balthazar (while he was mentioned in PoF beginning, which i did for the mount) ... also about the Livingworld1 i only know scraps due to the small cinematic video from ingame. i totally have no idea yet who vlast is, i know that glint is the girl who made the exalted magical empowered humans.
---
seems without the living stories, one misses tons of content here. and no idea where the "if three elder dragons die, world ends" came from, sofar the game was far from mentioning this. 
---
(i don't care much about the spoilers, i'd rather get some sense in the scraps and understand things thaha.)
---
That is a really sweet story. I'm glad you shared it!

What's the silverwaste one? I'm not aware of it and it's not on any guide I've seen

Try to be more mindful of what skills you're running to (for Fractals). If you feel like your team is fine with damage, stick to Moa, or if they need more survivability, try Water Spirit. The more fluid you are with your party, the better off the run will go. 
---
I use 2-1-3 for Skirmishing, and the added bonus of Crit Damage when you have Fury, plus the 7% increase in Damage from the SB line makes it worthwhile taking even in open world sometimes, especially if you don't need the addition support from Nature Magic or Wilderness Survival. 
---
And honestly, just use what you find fun. I LOVE that dagger has a 4 chain auto, and even though it is built for condi builds more than power builds, it still does damage in a power build. Sw/Axe is taken simply because the Sword auto hits the hardest, applies cripple which gives you the bonus 15% from Predators Onslaught, and Axe #4 hits like a truck! But as long as you aren't aiming for speed runs, and are willing to take things at a more chill pace, any weapon set is fine to use, just be mindful that there are other options which can result in more damage, and some people may not think as open-mindedly as you or me. 
---
It is now.
---
I found the renegade helm quite cool on charr
---
is there a better lod setting to use?
---
I hear hk tank is pretty good tho
---
I like Dueling/Illusions/Domination for a core Mesmer running Sword/Sword and Greatsword, and 60% crit chance before boons and buffs seems good to me.
---
As a Chrono, you don't actually need to use a Shield if you don't want to. It's main value is in Tides of Time for group alacrity and cc. Shield 4 is a nice block and can be good for damage, but you'll still do more DPS in Sword/Sword anyways. I like Chrono and I think it opens up a lot of possibilities.
---
Unfortunately I'm not familiar enough with Mirage to make any recommendations for it. I know it's pretty popular as a damage class, but the build I see in PvE most often is a Vipers Condi build.
---
Every time this is posted, I try watching it again. I think my record so far is about 90 seconds.

I'm hoping they eventually add the shoulders to the black lion statue vendor. I now have a shitload of those things after opening 50 chests, and not getting the shoulders.

I mean, i could totally play a tab-targeting mmo like ff14 on a touchpad,

But she uses arrows to move, numbers for skills and the trackpad to aim

She plays greatsword/longbow ranger in PvP (to be fair, (be)low silver) and has to stand still just to aim her longbow 5
---
I never felt bad about playing GW2 before watching that.
---
It would be neat if they added a boss to fight in the guild hall, or the ability to add race checkpoints, or perhaps a 10+ man dungeon that opens up that'd you only get rewards once a week for.

If only dodging forced the rest of your group to do so ;). Always fun when your 2 asshole pugs keep eating Artsariv's stomp (knowing full well you can stunbreak with hypernova launch out of her knockdown ball) and then go asking if you can switch to druid as if it was the healer's fault that they downed with adds up spamming conditions and eating a 30%+ boosted boon overload stomp on top of the orange circles they keep sitting on.

Are you 25 or is your brother 25? Because you are only an old sister as long as your brother is old technically, but i feel like most people would say their own age. Not really important but i would like to know how you meant it :D

I'm not recruiting right now, but when I **am**, I do what many other guilds do: post on [the official GW2 LFG forum](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/categories/looking-for-guild) as well as [the guild recruitment subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment/). I tend to not look for people who have posted themselves; too many posts, too low consistency. You'll see more results if you hit up people who have posted with slots open than if you sit back and wait to be discovered!

How can a completelly personalized story made by the rper's be static?  It's more dynamic than the theme park type mmorpgs in which there is 1 story which you always follow.

I don't actually role play myself, but one of my closest friends do. She was telling me about her joining a guild, in which she partook some kind of pilgrimage. They had to walk to a specific temple (no waypoints) and did several mini (personal) events in the process.  The whole guild has their own story going on - which adds a lot to the personal character immersion.    
---
It's not like your character awakens only during the living story episode releases and sleeps for the next few months.  If anything, the RPers are the ones who play the game as accurate as it's possible (playing the role of their character who, as we have seen in the story script doesn't know that they are only the avatar of some outerworld human playing the game).

I've actually never bought keys before this but those shoulders are quite literally the perfect final piece for my main. I had some statuettes from open world key drops and if I bought the 75 keys I could get the fire breathing bow/dragon glider (caved and got the bow) and then these shoulders in a few months time when they're available. I have a good income so the money is not a big deal but it still feels like an amazing waste as you're opening the chests getting junk. 
---
No? DD is basically the easiest to play dps, does this dps very well on sloth and can single handedly save the whole subgroup with pushing one button...

so all the witchdoctor videos i saw about the class were right, that's how you play it!
---
What gear and traits does a boon thief use? 
---
I want to bang your mum (if she's cute tho) 
---
Do you play Core Guard Roamer?
---
It's the same role, except that Revenant deals more damage, more frequently, has higher movement and more teleports. As well as CC (staff) and Team Boon support (Glint).
---
The problem? Terrible condition cleanse. Which means that without proper team support (fire brand) the Herald will melt in seconds against Scourges and Mirages. Plus he will be forced to use his heal skills to heal chip damage instead of saving it for emergencies like it was designed to.
---
Core Guard is often easier to play on Solo Queue since he brings it's own pack of Condi Cleanse (which is fantastic for a DPS) and have better healing. Albeit, less damage potential.
---
TL:DR
---
As a DPS class, Herald has the highest single target damage pressure on the game. But since it melts to condi, needs proper team support to work. Different from Core Guard that is more independent and share the same role.
---

&gt; Right, ArenaNet's main concern is turning a profit by selling products that feature exclusive content. If they brought gliding into PoF, less people would purchase HoT, because you would no longer need it to glide. It is unfortunate that there aren't any leylines or mushrooms or anything else that could incorporate HoT masteries on PoF, but there really is no need to have any of that.
---
I think you misunderstand; they are not suggesting that you would unlock gliders by getting PoF, but that more ways to use your glider would be available.  If anything, that might get someone who owns PoF but not HoT to get the other xpack, seeing that they could use alternative means to get places.
---
On the other hand gliding is basically obsolete with mounts existing so it doesn't really matter

---
one took a while to learn how to move properly
---
the other died fighting a firefly
---
they like the game, but are far from playing it
---
I just use exotic maces.
---
Since it's something you use for 5 seconds, it's not really a massive problem being down 14 AR. It's not part of your normal rotation, it's only for CC phases and those generally aren't throwing agony at you.
---
Maces are really only important for their skills, and not much else. I have BiS sigils in mine, but I really can't be bothered to make Ascended ones.
---
If you really wanted to post/show your build, you should have done it on r/pcmasterrace or r/buildapc.
---
What a configuration tough, i guess you need those 64 GB for video editing, rendering, graphism tasks ? Or whatever else need multitasking and so a lot of ram eating apps... be careful you might run out. 
---
I am glad tho that i can play the game as nicely and smoothly as you, without having to spend 2-3k €, and using a 4k monitor !
---
Hope I helped out, I tend to do some things in a way that sorta lowers DPS, but in the long run the only people who care are gonna be elite PuGs who aren't going to let you play anything but the meta anyways. Just have fun!
---
My brother was always playing those free to play Korean MMORPGS that were deliberately designed for you to pay to win or progress faster by paying. He was getting really frustrated about it because he loved the idea of MMORPGs but didn't want to pay a monthly fee. He's also really stubborn, so when I told him to buy Guild Wars 2, he kept saying no and installing new MMORPGs almost monthly. 
---
So for Christmas one year I decided to take a risk and buy him the game. I don't think he's ever went back and installed any f2p MMORPG since. He loved it so much he started looking up lore and wrote some short fanfiction stories on his free time, then ended up buying the original and playing that for a bit also. Now he's the one who tells me about updates in the game before I even get around to seeing them.
---
I don't remember what year I got him the game, but I'm 26 and he's 23 now. I've been playing Guild Wars since Prophecies some time around March or April 2006. To think, he might have loved the series earlier if only I bought him the original earlier. 
---
i like keeping a good balance between genuine stuff and shitposting

yep! a majority of the game has a lot a lot of gw1 music. Not sure whether I think it's a good thing or a bad thing though as I find myself going...."wait no that music is for x area not x area!!!"
---
But my favorite is always going through a snowy area and hearing some of the EOTN snowy area music....really brings back so many memories of travelling around with Jora...back when norn were super cool and interesting.

I thought the boon thief is core. I mean the one in raids
---
sadly hitler is banned too, i'm working on some wordplay between fuhrer and furry but can't come up with something decent :(
---
&gt;You can max out the crafting fine, but keep in mind you won't be able to purchase anything other than the raw materials. So you'll have to buy Basic materials like Ores, Logs, etc and also the Fine materials like Fangs, Bones, Venom, etc.
---
To be fair, that's a good habit to get into. 9 times out of 10 it's cheaper to buy raw materials and combine them yourself. The exceptions on gw2crafts are just outliers that save you a handful of copper for the most part.
---
I agree. When they know what their button does and actually use it. The point is, when you have a DD you expect them to clear the group. Why can't a DH be expected to stab the group if there is no DD?

If you've been running with training groups, are solid on your chosen classes, and are familiar with the mechanics and requirements of each boss (ideally with in-person experience, but optionally with guides/videos), you can probably get into most raiding groups that isn't speedclearing or selling. If they don't specify what type of player they're looking for, then message them and be honest about your abilities and what you're looking for. Joining a raid group is similar to applying for a job, with the difference being that you don't **need** a raid group to pay rent and can thus afford to be picky about what group you join. Start the conversation, and if they come back abrasive or elitist, you know it's not the sort of group you'd be interested in joining anyways.

Considering that I did the same to your mom, go ahead and try your luck. ;)
---
Feeling depressed after something like that is normal. Just find something else to put your energy into. Like something in gw2 or out and it'll help. I've also experienced the same from several mediums and it doesn't feel good.
---
I’ve always used cdkeys.com as I’ve found in the past I’ve gotten better value buying codes from there than in game prices.
---
Revenants has a realy different playstyle than what you usually play so that could be why you're struggling.
---
Score! 
---
The New Years festival of the Pig is going on right now.
---
I, too, follow the way of the Kodan. 
---
Your "gf's" drawing clearly fails to account for the linguistic mannerisms of the Quaggan. I expected better of foooooooo.
---
Wow. Can't believe I wasted all that time on that. Rip.
---
O lord where do I start with the garbage pile that is BDO. I sunk soooooo much time into that game to get fucked by it at every turn. It is nothing like gw2 and really is quite awful when you look at it for what it is. The only things going for it are good graphics imo.
---
Bdo has zero end game. Zip. Nada. Nothing. It's just more grinding until you die or your hands fall off.
---
There is no level cap and any armor/weapons/etc is rng so theres no guarantee to get good gear no matter how much time or effort you put into it. 
---
The big one is that its fully pay to win now. And since theres no level cap, people with no life or big wallets rule that game and there is no competing. 
---
Real Money Trading is against the TOS and both your and the other account would be banned. Post removed as this is not allowed.
---
Oh, you mean that time a bunch of rando people accused two friends of being what amounts to a prostitute and a john and regardless of what those two people said, would not let it go? And likely caused a bunch of harm to the community because of it?
---
None of that was ANet's fault, ya know. People took things the wrong way.
---
Personally I roll core warrior for most raids and fractals that I'm able to get inti (often times I cant do them or I just barely miss out on getting a spot due to how infrequently I do them) but I really like how Spellbreaker can keep momentum on its damage when switching from a damage set like axe/axe to a dag/dag, dag/mace, or mace/dag CC set from how flexible dagger is on the class.
---
Where'd the brother come from?
---
Dominator Staff is my rev choice. Looks like an actual melee weapon.
---
I'm really curious what people's search proces is sometimes
---
Technically RMT, but people give their guildmates gold to buy the expansion for them all the time. But I wouldn't try here; try your guild chat.
---
There may also be a scenario in which someone buys you it and you "gift" them gold as thanks.
---
Yes I hate this. Even when you mount up for just a second and 1/3 of your dodges vanish. 
---
What if you have all three but not in great amounts?
---
Does the triangle just get smaller?
---
well, don't let it keep you up at night lol.
---
Thanks so much!
---
Perfect
---
People just have to remember that ANet often adds exclusive skins to the Black Lion Statuettes. It usually takes a few months, but eventually they'll be there for a guaranteed unlock.  
---
Yes, you're still going to have to buy keys but a guaranteed opportunity to get what you want a few months down the road is better than buying 389479328472398 keys and praying RNGeezus is kind to you.
---
Quality shitpost. Mod approved. Stop reporting it lol, you all know this is so true.
---
that was the good one, self aware memes after a not so successful advertisement campaign was a positive thing
---
&gt; Edit: Why is this being downvoted?
---
Every thread in this sub gets downvotes regardless of merit or value.  Don’t take it personally.
---
Gotcha, guess i'll keep an eye out.
---
Well next month on the 8th of March is officially 2 months so if we don't get the episode by then it could be spaced out but I think it could be weekly.
---
Allright, cool! Thanks for the reply, really thought it would be the other way around. The more you know :)
---
Ill keep it in mind if I ever try it again, finally I went back to my Houndskin Mantle :3
---
First rule of boosting, don't boost your first character.
---
Make a second character, ease your way into the game, then come back to your boosted character.

My guild tried some 10 mesmer raids last week. I played [heal chrono](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQFAWl0nhS0YNawONQtGLEHVdm+phqZAkAL0ZFcBfGA-jxxGQBA4BAULlfk7CAMk9HajOAFp+jHVCSKA/mZB-e) and it healed pretty well but it couldn't carry quite as hard as heal scourge, heal tempest, or druid because it couldn't generate a ton of might, nor regen, nor could it remotely rez people (Illusion of Life was inconsistent). Anyone that got ported on VG or Cairn essentially died soon after. Between Cairn, MO, Sloth and VG, only sloth approached enraged timer. All others were failing from ports, bad positioning, or other failed mechanics.
---
The performance wasn't surprising though the experience makes me want to learn chrono hand kite. The results reinforced my opinion on raids and builds: pretty much any build with direction and proper traits/stats to push that direction is viable BUT people are used to getting carried by meta builds and role compression so when they leave that comfort zone, they are quickly exposed.
---
That was my thought. It was a joke, but like, has an answer
---
führry maybe?
---
we have invisible shoes so... 
---
the worst one -- Ele
---
Yea my old laptop had this issue and like you said i would just wait for few seconds (usually5-10) then it would just flash in to it. I think its about the pc specs. Old pcs have trouble with mounts cause on my new laptop I dont have any issue whatsoever
---
i dont i play support firebrand
---
How you know it should be generating 18 might? For us to understand the problem, we need a little more context my friend.
---
it also help manage software you run with gw2, select starting arguments (like no sound, seing map loading percentages, etc...) and can help select fastest server for update, it also used to help log faster into your account without using the gw2 game client but not since last patch. so it is really usefull to launch multiple account (multiboxing) but can be used as an ehanced game launcher client, look for the official threads on the reddit for more details.
---
Yeah i guess thats the struggle
---
Don't be ridiculous, chronos can't (rereads post)...
---
...
---
and.
---
In the morning someone was asking why he gets 25 might playing herald. Now you say it's bugged cause you don't generate enough might.
---
Just these 2 examples mashed together tell me everything is fine without even turning on the game.
---
&gt;5) i want to start making some legendaries, only 2-3 for now..i see the materials are pretty expensive, why is that? i thought there was a chinese server, can't we buy the mats from them?
---
This question is the most underrated one in my opinion.
---
&gt;4. The one you aren’t on
---
Jesus Christ just @me next time
---
There is the linked DE build, which generates might and fury while doing okay damage.
---
The core boon thief is based around [Detonate Plasma](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Detonate_Plasma), which can be stolen from some bosses and adds. It's much more powerful, but only applicable on a few fights.
---
[Detonate Plasma](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Detonate_Plasma)
---
Oh...  Do my facets only apply every 3s all at the same time even if I stagger their activation?  That would explain it. 
---
I wasn't expecting this thread to get 1.1k upvotes, WAY TO GO!
---
You don't proc Shared Empowerment every second with just facets, you'l only get it every 3.
---
Thanks op, i chuckled

Buy an Unbreakable Taimi from the gemstore for 10,000 gems. If you don't buy it before the sale ends, she dies permanently with no hope of restoration. It's the future of dynamic, branching storytelling.

this
---
Hello, hello, hello! Have you all seen those polearm wielding serpah on Lake Doric? Yes, I also agree. Polearms for guardians. It would do for a great weapon to grant guardians something they do not have that much good access too. In-combat and out of combat mobility. More leaps and ground targetted teleports please, something to chase down those pesky rangers and thieves who have too much mobility ;- ;
---
So, as someone with a single account, it's still worth using?
---
I've started playing Guild Wars 1 since my current computer broke and my old one can't handle GW2 beyond logging in for login rewards (it's like watching a video that keeps stopping and buffering on shitty wifi). 
---
Post-searing Ascalon is hella depressing. It's been helping the wait for the next episode (and for my computer to be fixed), the depressing/dead-inside bid, not so much. 
---
There's always 1

A bit late though. Missed all the good content from season 1and 2 of ls 
---
Right, I always forget that because it's not on the bar
---
It's not bugged.

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shared_Empowerment
---
&gt;Legendary Dragon Stance skills pulse their boons at the same time as each other, so they can't be staggered to give more might.
---
This means multiple boons from other facet skills being granted at the exact same time are counted as gaining a boon only once, which is why you only get 1 might each time the passive boons from the other facets go off.
---
&gt;At 100% boon bonus: Facet of Strength will cause might to max out at 14. With any other facet might will max out at 6 stacks.
---
With Facet of strength, if you manage to get your boon duration up to 100%, the might will stack to a max of 14 when out of combat. If you're using other facets but not strength, might will max out at 6 stacks.
---
It's working as intended.
---
There's no reason for you to maintain 25 stacks of might at all times when you're not fighting anything anyway. Besides, in my experience with my Herald, my might can go up to 25 and stay there pretty damn fast when I start attacking stuff and stay in combat.
---
My personal favorite for daredevil is [\[&amp;CskeAAA=\]](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Oblivion) :P
---
jokes aside, a friend got suspended or something cuz she named her character Loli Jugs..for realsies!
---
Yup, even if you stagger them they sync their applications.  It's silly but I suppose it's there so that Shared Empowerment isn't stronger than it's meant to be.  I just run that one trait that gives me Might when I gain Fury, can run the Strength Facet as a damage booster instead that way in open world.
---
The bigger concern is probably the awkward gameplay. If they were just worried about it being too strong the CD on Shared Empowerment could be increased or the base duration decreased.
---
\*inserts protec, attac meme featuring chrono (but with 10+ also)\*
---
If you are trying to min-max for open world PvE you are going to get very different answers, as there is no benchmark for open world content.
---
Personally run full berserker because I already have a set of full berserker, and it is easier to get more of than Assassin.

Please don’t try to edit the wiki while you’re drunk, thanks.

Holosmiths have a similar issue with their heat, it all vanishes as soon as you mount.

That's a weird way to spell Dreadnaught Visor (aka Cultural t3)

Okay?

Necro in open-world PvE, Guardian in Fractals.

Good morning lad, been sleeping for a while?

Pve: Used to be Reaper, but about a year ago I switched to sword weaver for nearly everything.

Pvp I switch a lot. This season, boonbeast, weaver, reaper, core warrior mostly.

... &lt;:? i thought this was pretty sweet. i started more hardcore playing gw2 just last year, and i have made lost of friends i'd like to talk about..... i'm sorry that you... didn't make friends???
---
It was a shitpost xd
---
This is my kind of shitpost.
---
Same, that's what I was hoping for as well. :(
---
Cant speak for the other questions but i can tell you for 8 that the name is just taken. Pretty sure i saw some pink glowing asura with bunny ears that had the exact same name.
---
Herald has a really ridiculous burst if landed correctly, but has tools to get out of sticky situations.
---
Conditions are it's one main weakness though, but there is an emergency cleanse combo used to get out of fights if yur being seriously stacked (Legend swap to Shiro to remove 1 condition (if legend swap cleanse is traited) &gt; Ripositing Shadows to remove all movement impairments &gt; weapon swap to staff for cleansing sigil to activate &gt; Staff 4)
---
&gt; t's not even remotely like Braham, though.

I was being very sarcastic.

CMs t4 and recs give 401 relics average daily and 19 pristines

I don't really like it. It's too low profile imo. It's not very noticeable and there's already 1 Rytlock. We don't need more running around lol
---
I never get people that ask if a game is still worth playing. I still play gw1. 
---
Maybe we were together yes. I beg you're pardon but you've talked about something werd... "read" ? What does it mean ? XD

---
...you know what? At this point all the chrono jail jokes don't hurt even hurt anymore, it's the best spec anyways, just so you know!!!!! Alts are for people who have commitment issues!! 
---
~~And a reminder from your friendly neighborhood chrono, please take a good look at which side of the jail the rest of you are at! You think you are free? You see that chain around your ankle called quickness and alacrity? That's right, you guys are nothing but addicts, growling like helpless infants with noodle arms waiting to suckle....~~

I honestly don't even know how the hell this relates to GW2. The dialogue reads as some anti-Big Brother ad, but it's about GW2 which... isn't about rebels or not acting against oppression...
---
Not if you sell it to drooburt. 
---
The same thing happens to me quite often. (even when tabbed down and afk)  
---
It's like a whisper cue, though in a different pitch. 
---
I wonder if Sugarcube facepalmed at Anet using that...
---
Don’t praise them for a half ass job. 
---
I don't mind basic, new player questsions, even ones easily looked up. If I don't like a topic or have no interest, I simply move on. Doesn't bother me.
---
I look at it in the way that at least there are people interested in the game. I rather have some interest shown rather than none at all or having these people turned off to the game due to an impatient rude response.
---
I'm reminded of the recent proposal for rules about art content. There'll always be ongoing topics people dislike. Why not just move on? It doesn't have to be a big deal really. There's never going to be a consensus about what content is "just right". I can understand about outliers, but not so much for content that people post regularly and keeps the subreddit active.
---
That’s not what I meant. Our group actually has all three, just in moderate amounts. As an example, sometimes were a little short on being chill. But most of the time it is pretty chill. Same for the other two.
---
Also, that first post was my attempt at a joke. I must not be funny. :p
---
I've already maxed out luck for my account, so no purpose to consume.
---
Not really since I haven't played any of the current season eps after ep1. I don't care about the story anymore.
---
Mine was also a joke, so you're not the one who's not funny there :P
---
Omg. Smoothie is everywhere.
