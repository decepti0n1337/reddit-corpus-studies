I have been full clearing raids every week for a couple of years now. I also don't spend my gold on anything because there's nothing left in the game I really want. Except, obviously, a superfluous array of burgers.
---

---
Honestly raids aren't the fastest gold farm, but they're the content I enjoy and it does add up.
---
---
---
it's not a must. he just likes it.
---
staff has range and cc, but doesn't outdamage axe/horn or axe/dagger. the marks get much more powerful with proper traiting, but they are very group unfriendly for dungeons - they tend to overwrite everything with dark field effects, and when you're planning a huge might rush and get a little bit of lifesteal instead...
---
... staff is part of why so many groups in core are down on necro, honestly.
---
you can always run dagger /dagger and trait the hell out of your lifesteal effects and throw in transfusion for a field friendly mass heal anytime you're in shroud.
---
honestly, a properly traited core necro isn't ever going to outdamage any of the Meta builds, but you can make it just ridiculously hard to kill. which is a good thing for pve, particularly if you're after exploration and tend to wind up with huge mobs after you while you run by to get a way point, lol
---
I noticed the same thing, it’s particularly bad on human females :(
---
If they didn't like it they'd ban Teapot.
---
plague doctor!
---
also I'd kill to see an elite minion master spec that actually makes mm viable outside core
---
Its not free you have to put the time into getting it. Depends on how much you value your time
---
Considering ANet's history, they hate all kinds of marketing.
---
Finally time to have a character and fashion for each elite spec. I hope you read this Anet. If you release new elite specs I will buy 9 more character slots and gem store fashion for each of them
---
If your squad is wiping because you lack support, you'll probably get less EXP if you go in with the best tagging class than a Firebrand or Scrapper.
---
In WvW it's more important to have proper composition and steamroll the enemy zerg than chasing personal success.
---
Part of the reason my server fails so often, there is always like 20-30 in squad with proper classes and we are surrounded by 30 random roamer-wannabes who think they are doing great because they follow commander and leech a few kills here and there from us, so we end up losing most fights because that attitude.
---
Learn to play both a support and a dps build, and go with what your commander needs most.
---
Maybe add a section for the daily gatherables stuff. I know personally I have 5 characters parked at the end of jps for the daily open and free season 3 gatherables.
---
Something extra to use those bank alts for.
---
Awesome! I just wished they uploaded to Spotify too... :/ I need that music for my D&amp;D playlists!
---
Mesmer is the exact opposite for me. I did kind of take some inspiration from meta but I actually managed to find a way to enjoy playing my Mesmer by using scepter mirage and focusing on torment more than clones. It's not good, I think condi rev puts out way more torment, but after not being able to enjoy Mesmer for years, it's nice to want to play it once in a while. 
---
I've actually never really set foot in meta builds too much, they're just not my cup of tea for gameplay. Three only one that pretty much ends up being meta because I enjoy it are guardian and necro.
---
My laptop was acting spotty. I figured I wasn't gonna be able to log in during the anniversary. Ended up being right. Haven't be able at all for the last 3 days.
---
I can't even quantify how horrid trolls are who would 'report' someone for sharing what took a person much effort and then caring to post a LFG for a home instance.  
---
The people who reported that should be warned that kindness isn't an abuse of the 'LFG' feature of the game.
---
My Mirage and Renegade both have a set of open world gear with them. I was so damn happy to ditch those traveller runes.
---
Huh. I don't think I've seen someone frame the ascended armor goal in the context of spirit shards and obsidian before. For me it has always just been whether I want to buy or slowly accumulate leather and cloth.
---
What's wrong with traveller runes?
---
it 100% is. The entire frothing part of the community that is livid about low effort "my first legendary/map completion/etc" posts have been ironically posting mockups of them for a while now, which lures in a mix of lurkers who upvote because they think its nice and don't understand its ironic, and people who know its ironic 
---
and upvote to mock the former lurkers.
---
It's...interesting, to see what shitposters get up to when they're bored.
---
I always go the route of hardest/slowest part when it comes to breaking down a grind 
---
The longest part of ascended crafting personally is always the spirit shards collecting which I try to get out of the way asap.
---
I've only been playing a year or so and that's on and off between lack of internet and currently laptop is running poorly and a desktop is on the way.
---
So unfortunately I haven't amassed the spirit shards of more regular players.
---
Ultimately, who cares why people want more characters? Do we need to justify this? The limit is arbitrary, so just make it 256 or 999 and be done with it.
---
Rune of the Revenant  
---
Why?  Well, I like the extra resistance on a heal - helps in all game modes, not to mention the "celestial" like boost to my other stats.
---
How stupid are you? Does it hurt?
---
In my experience with fractal PUGs it's impossible to have too much healing.
---
Ye boiiiiii
---
Wurm runes on a valkyrie reaper are my favorite. Just excessive levels of health and ferocity.
---
&gt; I have a feminist name.
---
&gt; riotgrrrrrrrrrl
---
Huh?
---
New player here who tried pvp for the first time and I have a few questions.
---
1. Is there a way to unlock the dances you get at the end of a match when you win to use whenever(they're different from the normal one everyone has)?
---
2. Does it matter when you do the "finish them"?  I've seen that sometimes I should do it immediately if I see their teammate showing up, but in that case why not always do it right away?
---
3.  When you die do you always have to sit there and watch your dead character for the time it's there or is there a way to go to a res point where your character is waiting but dead/unable to move?
---
4. I was doing pvp just for fun, but is there anything actually worthwhile to get from unrated only(I'm lvl 80, but I think I may lvl up some characters with this since I think it gives xp)?
---
FINAL.  
---
Unrelated to pvp, just something I keep forgetting to ask.  I've seen people with these minis that are like 3d 8 bit looking characters that make sounds from old games yet when I look them up on the trading post I can't find them.  How do you get these or any items related to them(like some boombox thing)?
---
I don't really know how you would implement any of the mechanics I described. Revs always get the same treatment for its elitespec.  They slap on 1 new legend and then call it a day. The general underlying mechanic of the class that should be changed through an elite spec was untouched up until now. To be frank I don't know if it is possible to change the rev mechanics in a meaningful way since rev is restricted in so many ways. 
---
However I still like my alac ren or condi ren for pve and power herald for pvp but they don't even remotly play like a ritualist. You are not playing like a caster at all. You are up front bashing the enemy and throwing your skills out so you can switch legends to get your energy back, that's the mechanic. You do not reinforce yourself through calling legends/spirits.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Traveler
---
+36 to all stats which does not really do much of anything. It's okay for open world of course but it's still pretty crap. Boon duration is the same between them and traveller adds 10% condition duration which is pretty nice but in open world which is all these are good for it's okay but not great.
---
With firework you get +175 power. Pure damage buff and instead of the condition duration you get 6 stacks of might fury and vigor for 6 seconds while in combat with 20 second cooldown. Those stacks give you +180 Power, +180 Condition Damage, 20% Crit chance, 50% endurance regeneration for 6 seconds.
---
So to recap traveller runes when you go into combat you get +36 power/condition damage and all other stats from the rune bonus. Firework you get +355 Power, +180 condition damage, 20% crit chance, 50% endurance regen for 6 seconds then +175 power for 14 seconds and back to those buffs again for 6 seconds. It's a very very nice buff, and that's all with the 25% movement speed buff as well.
---
If you don't care about the 25% movement speed or are running a class that has it passively then whatever the best runes for your build will be better than this performance wise, but for those classes that don't, and for open world Firework runes are just an awesome and welcome replacement to the traveller.
---
I gotta try the wurm/valkyrie combo one day.
---
As written at the beginning I'm highly sure they never make a new class however I don't think a title is going to stop them from bringing one. Like they did renames of stuff before and if they ever go for a new classes an excisting title is something they couldn't care less.
---
Proof:
---
Spellbreakers are derived from sunspears (paragons) and "Champion Paragon" is not a title for warriors.
---
&gt; Congratulations
---
Thanks!
---
&gt; de lux version and then when PoF came out another one added from 70 to 71.
---
Ah that’s probably it.  I fee silly for not thinking of that possibility.
---
Mounts still can't be used everywhere and also can't be used in combat where that speed buff can come in handy. I started playing as a ranger and the thief and got so used to doing jumping puzzles with that buff that when PoF came out and I switched to Mirage I couldn't do puzzles anymore because I my timing was all off with my speed being slower. 
---
But thanks to the firework runes you have a pretty decent rune there with the buff instead of crap like travelers. If I'm doing high end content I switch to my full ascended gear with proper builds but for open world I love these runes and that speed buff.
---
Hopefully the answer is given to you quickly.
---
1) not as emotes, no, but you can get [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/How_to_Dance,_Volume_1) from the gemstore which should let you do the same thing I believe
---
2) it matters because team fights are best won when there's...well, a team. Since you respawn based on your last full death, you can stagger the enemy players respawning 
---
3) nope, you get to sit there and watch until you respawn
---
4) reward tracks and daily achievements I believe are about it. You also earn PvP levels (not ranking) in unranked
---
5) I don't PvP enough to really have a strong stance on this one, sorry
---
6) those are from the super adventure box event that occurs every April around April fool's day
---
Well I mostly played ritualist in gw1 so I don't think I could come up with enough ideas for dervish to make something intressting. Also it takes quite some time and seems to see not a lot of intresst.
---
However as for dervishes for a short amount of time you could build for quite a strong lifeleach reaper build in pvp which played kinda like a dervish so there is that. Trait got nerved a few patches back and you still only had a scythe in reaper shroud but it was hella close to dervish.
---
+1
---
No reason not to. If they flop then I can finally get the closure that I need.  If they drop a gold mine, cool.
---
We about to find out. The 500 chef thing while it adds content I don’t think it really changes or brings anything to the table. So hopefully there’s some big news come the 30th.
---
Nice to know someone out there agrees. I feel like im on crazy pills whenever i visit this sub
---
Since I mainly stick to open world PvE, I use Pack runes on three of my characters, and considering adding them to more characters. They're loaded with important offensive stats and help fill in the gaps in Fury uptime on some builds.
---
They are showing confidence with the relwase. Otherwise they wouldnt leak the chef thing if that was a big part of the announcement.
---
why would u need a Nerf on Firebrand Condi exactly
---
*farms green carrion amulet  for a quick buck*
---
I am both disgusted and in awe of OP's efforts this day.
---
Welcome to riot games and broken lp gains.... oh wait wrong subreddit
---
Personally in open world I find it much mroe enjoyable to have a passive effect verses having to use abilities constantly to move faster and in open world having a perfect setup is not required.
---
Guys I accidentally my whole character, is that bad?
---
Pure genius
---
You're in too deep to back out now.
---
Looks exactly like the female version but without the bra.
---
They don't even have a sub tab for raid selling. We have to put "-sell" or be spammed to fuck by AFK adverts.
---
literally which hole did you two crawl out of
---
Oh this is full committal.
---
Great but the Wiki is edited by players. ArenaNet just hosts it.
---
Berserker, Dragonhunter, Holosmith
---
That’s a lot of DAMAGE
---
Yeah it's not required of course, never said that, just pointing out that ranger is a great class for swiftness upkeep and has a much easier time with it than most other classes. I do understand the preference of a passive signet or unconditional rune effect
---
You get one with the 6th as well. sooo ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
No, you should be fine. It's against LFG rules to Sell anything (which there have been people banned for selling home instances). however, there is nothing against freely sharing your home instance.
---
I'm in no hurry for ascended food, since I can just mooch off others, so good to know :)
---
\-flap-flap-.........................DIVE.
---
I wish we had storylines like that for elite specs/ other rewards like some armor sets as well ( heritage armor from wow comes to mind )
---
You're playing a thief.
---
Get used to random bugs, nerfs, and just overall being an afterthought.
---
Don't know why you'd do that for a Herald specifically. Herald has permanent swiftness effortlessly in Glint, which is faster than these 25% buffs (and overwrites rather than stacking)
---
I'm a big fan of Trooper runes on heal tempest. The condi cleanse hits ten people when you trait for ten man shouts.
---
Do we know the chef thing was a big part of the announcement?
---
Thanks so much!
---
Will they ever make the chests in our personal instances not need a key?
---
I haven't played with it much honestly, just core specs.  I'll have to look once I'm at my computer.
---
1. If I boost a character to lvl80, how hard is it to get into the later game content on that character? Like do i have to get all the hero points, and go get gear and stuff? I am currently leveling a toon, and i already had a lvl 60, but i have a character boosts that i want to use at some point after i level a character to max myself. 
---
2. How long would it take me to get the fox mount (i forget the name sorry). I had bought a skin for it a long time ago, but didnt actually have the mount, and now that im getting back into the game im wondering how long it would take. I have 1 level 80 i boosted but only used to get the raptor mount and nothing more, i didnt look into actually playing that toon much.
---
Funny thing is, the diseased plants at the farm in Kourna are actually burnable by both blue and red fire skills.
---
Ah, thanks for the help, looks like i wont be getting to use that jackal mount soon. Glad to hear that boosting is fairly easy to catch up on though, cause i think i have one boost used and got a second, so itll be nice having a lot of classes available if i want them.
---
Actually Abyssal Forest in the Mordremoth kit is still about 100g more expensive than the Nightmare one right now.
---
So Anet Says Your Character Race is not supposed to matter in the game, yet they make Race specific Food items? Really?
---
Ooh boy, I'm don't do most group PvE content aside from low tier fractals rather casually, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.
---
I find that guardians are generally always in a great spot for all kinds of content, particularly Dragonhunters. Quite simple to play, great burst and potentially contributing a lot of CC, and they rack up big numbers pretty easily. Firebrands are also an option in some raids, whether it's their boon support/healing build or condition damage build. 
---
I think recently thieves are quite good on certain raid bosses due to unique stolen skills, and they have some good damage as well. In fractals they can also help with group support for stealth skips, or more generally they contribute to CC with basilisk venom.
---
Druid is generally brought along as a support class, but Soulbeasts are a great DPS class. Power Soulbeast is pretty good, condition soulbeast is as far as I know considered one of the easier builds to learn and sees good use on some raid encounters.
---
Warriors tend to be brought as a mix of support (through banners and CC) and DPS. If you want to be a big meaty body hacking and slashing away, you could do way worse than warrior.
---
This bug is causing match manipulation. Anet should ban themselves.
---
Alright, well i dont plan on doing any high tier stuff soon as im not even level 80 outside my boosted toon haha, so i appreciate the input. Thanks again for all the help.
---
No problem! Enjoy the game, have fun playing!

I still push people around with social Awkwardness with a+d shuffling
---
You can fight NPCs, therefore it’s a pve game. See what happens when you use such incredibly vague definitions?
---
When you login to your account on their site.. click on the support link at top, then click on sign in again (should automatically log you in then), and then on your account name in the top right and click "My Tickets"  The ticket for your suspension should be listed in there.  In there you can directly reply and ask what it's about.  They should reply to you with quote(s) that your account had typed that lead to your suspension.
---
afaik they don't ban for that.. at least not yet.
---
&gt; You are allowed to invite anyone to your Home Instance, and they are allowed to farm your nodes. 
---
Yep, this is true.
---
&gt; You are NOT allowed to SELL invites to your Home Instance(for money/gold)
---
This is not entirely true.  I'm sure you could "sell" invites to your home instance if you use map chat, or guild chat if you want.  You just can't advertise your home instance on LFG.. selling or free, both aren't allowed through LFG.
---
Yeah, this is big brain time
---
Sure yeah! F2 is on dragonhunter and there isn't much anything special about it, it's just a really precise leap skill due to the ground target. The greatsword leap you're seeing me use in combination with a normal jump sometimes which is kind of hard to be consistent with, but the biggest tip I can give is that when you weapon swap mid air it cancels the ending portion of the leap animation which extends the distance. Sadly they nerfed that with thief's vault for some reason I don't quite understand.
---
Yeah, the Divinity's Reach one has always been my least favorite of the birthday backpacks. Not a fan of the just rucksack with a funny green hat look it's got.
---
It's ctrl+right click

shift+left click is for linking the skill in chat

No, that isn’t the Super Adventure Box. SAB is like a platform game within gw2, but only available during April-ish every year. You play it to get rewards and currencies you can use to get minis like that.

---
Have you asked A-net?
---
No, I mean the class. The class as a whole has received so many nerfs, it's worthless now. Ruined. Dead. Destroyed. Whichever word you want to use, it's done. It was never "hugely powerful". The only people who said that were shit at the game and didn't know how to deal with it. Anet stupidly listened to those stupid people and now the class is literally worthless. 
---
And there you go with that idiotic logic again. "It's been stripped bare but it's not bad because SOMEONE in the world uses it". Do you even realize how dumb you sound?
---
No, you don't, otherwise, you would have shut up long before now. You can say my argument failed but I'm not the one rage quitting here, that's on you bruh. If anyone's argument has failed, it's yours and if I have to point out why (Which, given your level of intelligence I probably do), you haven't been paying attention.  Nah, it's not name-calling. "Idiot" really is the best word to describe you.
---
Listen, bro, if you can't handle the truth of what you are and the matter of fact, then you really shouldn't be starting arguments where you clearly can't handle it.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/ZLCo8ot.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZLCo8ot.png)
---
You didn't bother to read the comment that you replied to. You're very fixated on "2 hours" which is obviously an exaggeration if you're including literally every meaningless achievement, but that's pants-on-head retarded because there is absolutely nothing to gain from doing them all unless you're a completionist. Most people won't ever bother with collections unless there's an incentive to do them, such as unlocking a new mount. An achievement isn't *content*, it's something that is related to content. So when there are like 5 achievements related to some single story instance, the only thing which is the actual content to play is the story instance.
---
Also the fact that you call me lazy on the basis of nothing just kinda indicates that you're feeling salty and defensive because you don't like anybody criticising the game that you don't seem to have any complaints about. Well unfortunately for you, that's just how the world works-- not everyone likes the same stuff.

You should first restart the game to see if it persists. Then, check your graphics drivers to see if they are up-to-date and installed correctly. Then, try running a repair of the game files. Then, try a fresh installation of GW2.

Upvoted for visibility on the off-chance this is legit and not a troll post. If legit it is indeed quite disturbing.
---
I can only think of two possibility. Anet knews it. Anet was hack.
---
There is no bullet proof security. I just need to be more secure than my neighbors.
---
Ummm...maybe statistics for nsoft? Its weird for me
---
UDP &amp; 53 port, probably just DNS
---
Upvoting cause...concerning. Would like to hear from Anet on this.
---
Oof
---
Two more possibilities: 
---
A-net was hacked. You were hacked.
---
Pretty much every map has underwater parts, wtf are you talking about.
---
what they did before raids were introduced.
---
I don't even know what a cs farm is, but I can say that mostly I've seen people farming zones that have a lot of champs, so Kessex Hills is consistently busy. I suspect Frostgorge is busy and I know Brisbane Wildlands is pretty busy. In the case of Kessex and Brisbane, they have plenty of those bandit bounties to kill that spawn all the time in rotation pretty much, on top of the other champ events.
---
we were talking about presence, not about consumption.
---
Krall, to were expectes here.
---
No, just a DNS server hosted in China.
---
As were you.
---
How is that disturbing? DNS servers are hosted all around the world and wherever OP might be located, it makes sense that his traffic might hop over there...
---
OP should check his computer for malicious software or misconfiguration.
---
- UDP port 53 is a DNS lookup request.
---
- The IP listed resolves to [ns3.dns.com](https://dns.google.com/query?name=ns3.dns.com), a large Chinese DNS service that was formerly run by [comodo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS.com_LLC) as their "secure DNS" software.
---
- If you monitor your network traffic you'll see GW2 makes plenty of DNS lookup calls on port 53 (asset server, login server, gemstore) but they all use whatever DNS server your system is configured to. This only takes a few seconds to check with applications like wireshark.
---
- OP only posted a screenshot that his system blocked that specific IP but not which application made the call.
---
- The sky is falling.
---
Just quit already, the game is a piece of shit.
---
Massive lag in WvW, utter class imbalance, almost 0 WvW combat changes since launch, it's an anime virgin's lightshow of cosmetic cash store purchases.
---
you should do it once just for the experience. even on a lvl 80
---
I just capped all my traffic with wireshark and got only a couple UDP hits, all of which were local. No connection to Chinese servers at all as OP claims. I very much doubt it's gw2 sending data.
---
&gt;Other than MSwindow, GW2 is the only program running and trying to connect Internet.
---
How do you know that?
---

---
&gt; Two more possibilities: A-net was hacked. You were hacked.
---
Could be. I run couple MMORPG and couple programs with open source(source code). The rest I run my own programs. 
---
This is the screenshot(http://magaimg.net/img/8t60.jpg). The title shows the program I run. I configure it to block lots of IP(s) including MicroSoft.
---
Tracert shows my IP is on AT&amp;T network. I do not run GW2 on VPN. No other Internet connecting programs were running when I run GW2.
---
I hope this is nothing, otherwise....
---
PeerBlock and similar programs have been around since '90 or even earlier. Source codes were widely available.
---
Wow, I didn't know that. I wonder if that's the reason why GW2 doesn't have Cantha in it. Are all GW2 expansion revolves around the Tyria content? 
---
Also, it's quite unique that Guild Wars has a 'Main' quest-line. Wow had separated quests and you have to chain the connections and flow between them. I'm happy GW has a main-complete quest. I was told her the main quest is just OK, but the lore picks up on expansions. Does all races has the 'same' main quest?
---
Any general idea of how much each ascended meal/feast will cost after you're done with the collection?
---
And yet that screenshot does a grand total of nothing at all to "prove" that it is Guild Wars 2 making those connections. And the fact that you seem so adamant that there is a grand total of nothing other than Guild Wars 2 connecting to the internet is quite weird. There are usually a bunch of stuffs on your computer connecting to the internet. Especially if you have some sort of malware or something in your computer which seems to be the case here.
---
The good thing is if you take those silvers out of the TP now they become hundreds of gold due to natural inflation over the past 6+ years.
---
Just because gw2 is the only program visible, that doesn't mean it's the only one running. Scan for malware.
---
Or, you know, buy gems for real life currency as intended.
---
I’m all for flexibility and ease of use. That doesn’t exclude the possibility of long term progression systems. The mastery system is fine, but it lacks choices - it’s simply something you level up and has no personalization to it. 
---
As far as horizontal versus vertical, I’ve always thought of vertical systems in MMOs as relating to gaining levels. That’s your primary vertical progression. The horizontal system in Rift was a long term system which allowed small choices which sacrificed other choices, for a degree of character customization. It’s was more comparable to a finer grain extension of the build/trait system we have already, but offering little tweaks to strive for.

You know call me crazy but I kinda believe that someone who takes 7 years to complete the world would be lost when it comes to a screenshot.
---
You get downvoted because you act like a ret-- special person.
---
Isn't this because they used Amazon's budget servers? They might make nice web servers  but I have no idea why you would use them for performance related tasks.
---
I doubt you can make just arbitrary in the first place. And even if we pay 10$ for a toon, I doubt it will cover the cost for data maintaining for thoose toons. Imagine some wicked playera actually getting 100-150 or more toons.. the UI is not suited for this and then it will require much more storage space on main servers and all the facilities to actually maintain thoose servers.
---
My opinion that higher numbers are unprofitable and unreasonable from a logistical PoV. And (I don't want to offend anyone, but..) it's a very niche thing that requires a lot of dev power to accomplish it (UI revamp, loading times adjustments, logistical tweeks and so on..)
---
They've forever put players over maximizing their income. People bitch 24/7, but they don't know what they're talking about. GW2 has the tamest cash shop in the industry.
---
&gt; There is a percentage of the hard core population that is extremely disenfranchised. They're looking for hard content all the time.  
---
you are pretty much clueless about the whole thing if you really think that this is the problem. maybe you should go out of your bubble a bit and see what other guilds do and how they play and what the problems are instead of telling people that they played too much or are simply burned out even if they aren't.
---
I was talking more in a sense that it was presented to ArenaNet in multiple forms and it's ultimately been ignored.
---
They did try to fix some issues but it's generally the same.
---
 Hi.
---
I'm in a bit of a pickle here. Last time i played GW2 was about 3 years ago. Yesterday i decided to play again, downloaded the game and logged in. Only 2 new chars there (lvl 1-5), nothing in the bank etc. I thought i probably deleted my chars last time to start new etc etc...the "dumb" thing i did then was that i bought both expansions. Today it struck me that it probably was a new account. So i tried my old email-adress and voila, my old chars, old bank etc
---
I made some screenshots to show you what i have: [https://imgur.com/a/O1dAh0r](https://imgur.com/a/O1dAh0r)
---
The thing is now, i have all this nice stuff like boosts and lots of karma or some dyes from the birthday presents on my old account without expansions. On the new one i would have to start from zero. Leveling a new character isn't a problem, i would have done that nevertheless because jumping into the game at lvl 30-40 isn't something i like. But it would have been nice to have all the stuff i accumulated.
---
On the other hand, i know some veteran players are now rolling their eyes because what i call my "treasure" is probably not so much :D
---
Also it would be nice to have the names of my chars available...but that's a lower priority.
---
I hope you know now why i'm a bit torn, maybe you can give me some advice on how to "save" some of my stuff, something like "spend karma on XYZ and send it to new chars" or whatever.
---
Thanks in advance for your help!
---
I play both extensively. While both get the short end of the stick, I’d say thief is on the bottom rung of ANets priority.
---
I didnt know they've added Challenge Mote to PvP \^\^" :P
---
It's also the third rune in the old Norse FUÞARK. Maybe should have mentioned that part.
---
you forgot the making of a photo with your potato smartphone
---
i played since launch and never done a map completion.
---
While having 20k hours playtime, 20 chars and being in top 100 on gw2efficiency
---
Isn't that the point? If you want to stay at a higher rating you need a higher win %
---
No, gain discrepancy can get bigger ranges, such as \[+5,-30\] for being challenger/plat 3, the same range would translate into \[+10,-20\] for being plat2/plat1 and the ratio would keep balancing until it finds the belly of the bell distribution chart, which should be around silver/gold.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Of course, the variance should work also as a function of the global team matchmaking ratio versus the enemies' one.  
---
Note: \[+X,-Y\] means +X elo for winning and -Y for losing.
---
raid training discords/guild and get a good starter class where you can focus more on the boss mechanics rather then on your rotations like heal tempest
---
Yeah but its not really reliable. You can't tag the enemies if you're wiped right? So while one day you can get 10 ranks without even noticing, the other day it will feel like a slog.
---
I remember when GW2 first launched and people were getting temporary bans all over the place, jumping onto Reddit and claiming to be innocent.
---
The GMs linked screenshots of them throwing around racial slurs casually in map chat.
---
Young male white gamers are a very immature and toxic group that have become so numb to their own vile language that they really don't even realise what they are writing. Then act so entitled when they get called out for it.
---
Well, I just wanted to know why I had gotten banned (which I got a response to, and I'm okay with the ban as now I understand why I had gotten banned, it's fine).
---
*...Clever girl.*
---
that outfit looks like it was forced down Anet's throat by... something... i still dont understand what made them think this starskimp eyesore would ever be popular other than as a meme. the way they choose to apply the armor plating to this outfit gave me so many questions that i just started laughing
---
Every time I have to break out the Springer, I die a little inside.
---
Just totally halts my momentum.
---
you missed out a detail, it was printed and hanged on a wall, before another pic of it was taken
---
GW1's gearing system was so good, it's a shame nobody ever really adapted it into a full, open world MMO.
---
Every time I want to try a new build in GW2, it feels like such an ordeal getting all the gear together. Even the exotic equivalents for a lot of stat allocations are often unavailable on the TP, which means I need to either craft them, or go out of my way to get them.
---
I guess that's just the price you pay for horizontal progression, though - it's still a damn sight better than having to replace my gear every content cycle.
---
My eyes 😬
---
Still that rng, at least at seems is not balanced in game at all. Sometimes there are teams that are 1 side is all around Plat where the other team has 1 Plat and mainly gold. (this is just by asking at the beginning  several games in map chat so yea)  so it seems like there is not even an internal match balancing so that for example the rank of all players per team combined is somewhat close to each other.
---
Is the tractricoid still spinning?
---
There's a free chair available through an achievement, you know.
---
I guess i just gonna start on the new account, play for a while and then decide what to do. I probably don't need multiple accounts for dailys etc because my playtime is pretty limited. I just want to start a new character and play that one.
---
But you're right, i will keep the old account, maybe it really comes in handy sometimes.

 So I wanna give this game a try and I wanna pick a class that will keep me interested in exploring the game more. When I was trying out World of Warcraft, I was playing Beast Mastery Hunter. I do not know if that was the most fun class in WoW, but I surely had fun playing it. Which class should it bE? 
---
Usually I love gunners, mages and such.
---
yeah and i also never mentioned that i am the majority in the first place. like wtf. my very first comment already said that if the OP is a player which looks for endgame stuff in a non casual way, he should rather stay away. there is nothing to discuss over that. if not, the game is fine.
---
Join a raid training discord - the easiest way .
---
i cant buy gems, i always get an error. am i the olny one or ist this a server thing?
---
pretty much... most of the stores stopped carrying it
---
I dont see a problem with raid selling, but I do have a problem with the LFG clutter it brings. You can filter the sellers out, but its a shame that doesnt stick when reopening the LFG window, making you type it again.
---
You have to like your character. Most of us will never notice you in the game.
---
Thats the same for every class. FB you're responsible for keeping ur dps alive, Revs and Eles are even squishier than Necro and every class caught out of position is gonna get smashed.
---
&gt; Beast Mastery Hunter
---
If you want a pet, ranger is probably your best bet, although necromancers have pets and mesmers do in a roundabout sort of way. I think rangers have a different feel to them to WoW hunters, though.
---
&gt; Gunners
---
Thief might be up your alley, but lost of them can use rifles or pistols. 
---
&gt; mages 
---
Elementalists are the magiest of mages, but mesmers, necromancers, rangers (with druid spec), guardians and revenants could all seen as fairly magey depending on how you build them.
---
To everyone who commented, here is the reasoning as to why I was banned. At the time of doing a meta event in Haraithi Hinterlands where you have to help the Seraph forces retake the camps, I believe it was during the phase of moving up to get to Ulgoth, there was a whole pack of Modniir beginning to rush us and I said something along the lines of "C'mere you horse-\*\*\*\*er!" and more aggressive chat directed towards the Modniir in map chat which was directed not to anyone but the Modniir themselves. I suppose that may have flagged or triggered something unbeknownst to me and I had gotten banned shortly after that. I'm fine with the ban, I just wanted to understand what I said that threw up a red flag for the moderators and what I need to be a bit more mindful of when I say in chat. Again, the line of "C'mere you horse-\*\*\*\*er!" was in the context towards the NPC's, not anyone in general, but I can understand as to why I was banned for a week.
---
So why were you banned?
---
Yeah, I've got one of each. These days 4 of them are sitting at a food farm like strawberries. Once I get crafting 500 done I'll probably put them back at the end of a good JP.
---

Just made a post about it, have a look. On one hand I see it as both hilarious and stupid, but on the other hand, I can understand where they are coming from as well, it is just safety measures.
---
Don't tell me i did not bother to read your comment i did read everything and the fact is that you said you finnished in 2 hours and that is a lie. Because finnish means you do everything and obviously you did not do everything. And yes you hit the nail when you say everybody likes different things. But if you really belive that a game company are able to cate to EVERYBODY at any point with anything then you live on another planet. There is no other game that manage that because yes people like different things. 
---
And salty? About what? It is PvE, how are you salty about PvE? Again you just throw shit out hoping to hit and miss by a mile. If you had checked you would find many posts from me where i tell when something is not working for me or a game mode. My game to go too first is WvW so you can imagine i have many post behind me about that. 
---
And with this i am done because it is pointless to talk to some one who just throw shit around hoping to hit but there are no valid points in that.
---
Huge charr holding that tiny sparkler looks kinda silly 😂
---
i don't have the banker, but i can put the scroll/tomes in a shared slot so it works out
---
But end game stuff in a non-casual has no meaning without identifying your demographic that's my point. Do you really think that those words mean the same thing to everyone. That everyone shares your definition. What is end game anyway? How serious is your end game. 
---
The problem is everyone has different definitions of hard core and casual. There are people who call themselves hard core that aren't really hard core, from your definition or mine. I consider myself casual but a lot of people keep telling me I'm not casual, because of the number of hours I've played. These things don't have one singular definition. Your words can easily be misleading without knowing a lot more about who you're talking to.
---
A guy who comes here JUST to raid, or to ONLY PvP in tournaments and nothing else and get somewhere on a leaderboard, that might be a guy who isn't into this game. But there are still people who do end game content and consider themselves hard core and compared to me they probably are, but they're also not necessarily competitive. This whole conversation is you assuming people understand what you're saying when I've never seen groups of people agree on those definitions at all.
---
A2 and G2
---
WvW zerg
---
There are no xp in WvW only wxp which counts towards your rank and not leveling. The only xp you can get from WvW are the tome of knowledge which drops with each rank up chest and when flipping a keep for daily. 
---
This will tell you what you get wxp for. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_Experience
---
I guess it's not really your thing huh?  Personally world completion is my favorite thing in GW2, it's the first thing that I achieved basically.
---
I plan start playing GW2 this week, and I'm not sure which Race to pick. I don't mind much about Racial abilities (and I understand they are not important as for today) or the look of the race.   
---
That being said, I come playing Guild Wars 2 after a long day for some immersive escapism - so I wish the starting zone will feel Serene, relaxing. with Epic soundtrack. Now I know that at some point I will move around zones and some will be more darker, but I want to start the game with that. Kinda like the Night-elves starting zone in WoW.
---
Just split into groups of 10 and go take towers and camps :)
---
I always wondered why you are not able to move that pop up on the screen anyway.
---
You must not play PvE much
---
If you can buy gems in the gemstore with your credit card, then you can buy Heart of Thorns in the gemstore with gems.  It's pretty straightforward.
---
If you *can't* buy gems in the gemstore - like, at all - then I guess you'll have to find some other way :\\
---
Uh...mind giving me a link for the male version?
---
I mean, regardless of the game, my statement is true. Dead mobs tend to do less damage.
---
This is what i meant. I mean spvp and wvw progress bars are basically another exp bars.
---
Oh sorry I didn't realize you were a moron
---
I agree. So it would even out!
---
There is only one offical retailer listed, but they don't have Heart of Thorns, it's out of stock.
---
So it seems like I'm only left with offical Guild Wars 2 store.
---
 
---
&gt;The answer to this question depends on your credit card company. In most cases, the credit card company just does the currency conversion for you.
---
I see, so I'm gonna need to look into that.
---
Yeah that used to bug me a lot; we have so many classes who can cast some sort of flame (firebrands, elementalists, beserkers, and a few others) and so many burnable objects, but like 99% of the burnable objects can't be burnt using your skills
---
So that's where he's been moved from w7
---
Yup! Free boons going into combat is really handy. I got them for my chrono boon sow gear but I use them all the time now. It's a solid set if you produce a lot of boons for yourself, which DPS chrono really, really does.
---
My quickness Marshall's -spec Firebrand has been suffering from a low health pool (&lt; 13K) for a while now, so I switched over to Marauder's and tried out Vampire runes.  Now I have \~21K health, and get 10% of that back every time I kill something.  It's pretty baller.
---
There are some limitations though.  Like, it only seems to refill health if you killed something that gives EXP, so it loses its value in story instances and big events with trash mobs.
---
And you seem to have poor reading comprehension.
---
Added.  Evolutionkb.2069
---
Definitly not a bug. Oil slick is a nasty skill even after the nerv to the skill.
---
And on windows to boot
---
the demographic is irellevant if you look at the bigger picture.  
---
in several gamemodes not only the absolute top teams / guilds are getting less and less, even all those little semi hardcore guilds are basically gone and none came after them.  
---
as example for teamcontent in the scene there were a lot of known "underdog" guilds for fractals / dungeons / raids where a lot of players did go when they reached a certain skill level but were not good enough for "better" guilds or simply couldn't be assed to do trials and whatnot. i don't know a single one which is alive to this point.  
---
if i look at wvw, its the same there on my server. we had a lot of guilds and serverpride, there was a core which never changed servers and kept stuff running. we were even in the highest tiers. now its a wasteland and we got even linked and its still a wasteland most of the time. may be better on other servers, i don't know. for players which do not want to spend money for serverchanges 24/7 to be able to go where the action is...i dunno.  
---
pvp is botinvested by now and a lot of afk is going on when people dislike some game. since anet is not punishing this, its not fun anyway. and that happens also for everone, not just top players.
---
&gt; There is only one offical retailer listed
---
Incorrect. You've misunderstood what I said. I said "any retailer on Arenanet's list". I *did not* say "any retailer on Arenanet's list for your country". Check other countries. If the online retailer will accept your credit card, you can purchase it from them.
---
There are no regional codes. A Heart of Thorns code purchased in the US works exactly the same as a code purchased in Australia or France or anywhere else.
---
I think the sylvari might be nice. All nature and puppies.

---
There was an update to stat-selectable trinkets, so all stat-selectable-trinkets had their stats reset. I think it happened a few times, it should usually give you a pop up that you have trinkets with no stats selected.
---
Yeah, there's a loooot going on in that video.  That much action has always caused problems and skill lag, so I don't know that it makes much sense to expect otherwise.  I haven't noticed anything different in terms of performance recently.
---
What I have noticed, though, is the **rampant** use of third-party program hacks in WvW.  Player videos and evidence is everywhere.  I've always stuck up for ArenaNet and defended them even when it was unpopular, but I'm super-pissed at them for their inaction on the hacks.
---
A couple of days.
---
I feel like the opposite should be true but I can't figure out the logic for it. Why should an easy win pull higher points than one that took work?
---
Worthy of a gold.
---
We killed it though... Largos however...
---
That east cave was my first jumping puzzle too. JP are one of the best things in this game
---
Very noice. Take long to make?
---
Hmm not really.. its very easy and simple but still worth doing it
---
 in what percent you can start playin GW2 nowadays?
---
Asura is even faster . All same map. With bettle it takes less than 10 mins
---
At launch I had made a max-size norn ranger to play with, played with it a little (got up to about level 20 I think) and then just kinda forgot about the game for no specific reason.  
---
Then when I picked the game back up two years later (right after the end of LS1) I played some more with that character until I eventually decided to make a new character, a min-size asura elementalist. And the thing I remember the most from making that character was the fact that I actually felt tiny. I was used to just looking down onto everything, but then things suddenly towered over me and I was just in awe as I looked at everything around me
---

i jumped there few months ago and my goal was to get on top of the airship, which i did :D

THERES ANOTHER JESUS RAPTOR OUTSIDE ARAH?????
---
Every sale has two main goals for ArenaNet: Getting ppl to spend money or draining the supply of liquid gold.  That is not new (it was always the case) and it works every single time. I am fine with that and prbly everyone who is browsing reddit will know the rules of the game already. But ppl don't care or are buying other stuff than blk or character slots.
---
Getting enough gold to wear the Asura light T3 cultural armor.... An armor set I’ve felt in love since before the beta.
---
... only to find out it was horribly glitched, like there were parts of the arm that would stretch horribly. It was eventually fixed but it took months. My OCD prevented me from wearing it, so I had to rely on other sets. I guess by that time we were getting our first FotFW and the shiny radiant gloves were my new jam, so I built another look around that with the HotW light armor set.
---
And then we were in the middle of LS1 so I was deep in the loop of following the story, doing achievements. I have great memories of the Battle of Lion Arch, this remains my favorite lifetime moment so far in a MMO. I’ve never experienced the attack, destruction and loss of a main city in real time. 
---
I think what I miss the most is the mystery around the map. Like, not knowing how Maguuma Jungle or the Crystal Desert is, having only my imagination and few bits of lore to make my own idea. Back in 2014, Southsun was the only new map. It took over a year before we got our second one, Dry Top. New maps were extremely rare back then, so everytime we got hint at new territories the playerbase went crazy. All that build up toward HoT was amazing too.
---
Now, new maps are business as usual. The pattern has become too predictable. I do have hopes for S5 though, but still, I’ve grown since launch in 2012 so the magic is not the same.
---
To be honest, not really. 
---
To start with, even a simple DH. The core of the rotation is more or less not breaking your aa chains, and using big skills with F1 and a symbol up. 
---
99% of people who didn't even see the rotation didn't read their traits either, they simply don't know it works this way. 
---
Also, what are those psychic powers I'm unaware I have?
---
If you make the group yourself and YOU ask to see the LI, half the time it'll work everytime and your camouflage will be perfect until the fight starts.
---
Don't worry LOCH will make the ultimate comeback in ERP 5!
---
Don't forget the "thank god you're leaving!!!" comments
---
WvW actually working... Still waiting tbh.
---
I've always enjoyed the Superior Rune of Vampirism. Maybe I just like the extra healing/health.
---
Are the champ rush rewards for the community goal locked atm or do i need to do something special this time to get credit for it? I allrdy killed a few champs and got boxes.
---
yuh, My bad
---
You can throw 4 into the mystic forge and maybe (I think it was a 20 or 25% chance) you will get rare ones back (crests, orbs, ...) and there is also a low chance (according to wiki 2-4%) to get an amalgameted gemstone.
---
Strangely, these games already are taken into account - for League chest pip gains only.  I imagine programming them into consideration for rating adjustments would make the code excessively convoluted, else they would have done it, because it does make sense.
---
I believe if you put 4 of them in the forge you have a rare chance at the  Amalgamated Gemstone.
---
#
---
So the wiki is just incomplete?
---
Actually, and I don't usually do this, I'll try one more time.
---
Even if this is all true, the OP didn't ask about hard core or casual. He asked a very simple question about traffic in low level zones. He didn't ask about raids. He didn't ask about end game. He didn't ask about PvP.  You being dissatisfied doesn't mean anything if you're not answering the question actually asked. 
---
Clearly the guy is interested in whether or not there's traffic if he starts. The answer to that question is there is.  If you see anything in the OP to indicate this guy is a hard core guy, I'd like to see it.
---
I get it. You're mad and disenfranchised. And if the guy was asking about PvP, or about raids, maybe you'd have a point replying that way, but this just doesn't answer the OP's question at all.  
---
He didn't ask if you like the game, he asked if early zones are busy.
---
Sad that you're so disenfranchised that you want to bring other topics into this one, but there are plenty of those for him to browse.
---
How did you answer what the OP asked?
---
Yes, and just know I distinctively remember I tagged the first preserver, killed two pods, and then killed the both.
---
I can talk only about what I've seen over the years playing, let's say, hardcore.The thing is, because Anet is trying to cater to casuals (which you can't deny, their whole model is 'hey, we have some new story for you, have fun for the next two days and come back in three months, just remeber there's cool stuff in gemstore) which is dooming the game. Not because I don't get hardcore content as often as I'd like, but because when I get it, nobody's happy.I'd say it's an amalgamation of  
---
\* casual idea of how the game should be played  
---
\* lack of any direction for the players.  
---
This one is not an issue if you check external guides or wiki, but people who are casual don't even know there's a huge-ass wiki that holds most of the stuff that's important in the game. There's no system teaching you how to play efficiently, what your skills do, how to dodge etc. There's no roadmap for new players, nothing that pushes them from being a guy in masterworks to a guy in full ascendedHave you ever played Summoners War? They have great roadmaps for players, be it making your first farming mob or teams for endgame farming, they have you covered, all steps are put in front of you, there are rewards that are either cool or outright necessary to progress (e.g. a mission chain guiding you to a really useful support unit gives you some of the components needed to create it as rewards). In gw2 the game hopes you eventually look something up at the wiki, at the same time not even telling you there's /wiki command.  
---
\* lame attempts at making 'harder' content.   
---
Content like w4 or w7 shows us that Anet is indeed trying to find that sweet spot for both hardcores and casuals. The thing (which is very visible on padim) is that they're failing miserably. Last week we needed one pylon kiter because someone couldn't make it for the raid appointment. We rotated I think 4 or 5 different necros, all of them were failing constantly, half of them was unaware there's a trait that you can (you shouldn't need it if you're good however) use in order to not die.   
---
And that's the thing. It's casuals fault that the game is like this. Because they assumed they don't have to learn, anet tried to make easier content so they don't have to learn and failed miserably instead of giving them an ingame progress guide.   
---
However, I think it's even more visible in fractals, mostly because LI is worthless now.   
---
But there's a huge difference between people who like me have a stack of essences and people who have none or just a few.   
---
And that's why we have such a huge split. Because I am experienced enough to pick and choose people who are on my level, who will bring that firebrigade, dh, weaver, soulbeast or mesmer. I don't need to spend more time because someone came on his condi pistol thief.   
---
tl;dr Yes, it's casuals fault, because they assumed the game should be easy, and Anet never made any moves to give them direction, instead just made content easier, which made everyone unhappy because it's either too easy for hardcores or too hard for little timmy in his exotic nomad warrior.
---
i know right?? i don't think i could've done it myself. such a god of gw2

Fun fact - This is actually an errant gadget (a type of content object that is used to place mechanics in the world). Whenever designers place a new gadget, it automatically gets assigned this "turkey raptor" by default, because it was an obvious signifier to the team that it's placeholder art and needs to be reviewed. It was also not uncommon practice to hide some content objects in the air, since at launch players couldn't have ever gotten this high. I'm sure skyscales will turn up all SORTS of hidden designer tricks. :-P

are we gonna get a reminder 1h before you leave the game as well?

Really enjoying this event and he excellent production value. No downstate raiding is the hardmode we needed, judging by how our competitors are fairing. Looking forward to seeing who comes out on top. Maybe the raid bosses win it all in the end.
---
Everyone love puppies, thanks :-)
---
And as an Engi you can share half of it with other players! With Medical Dispersion Field.
---
There was absolutely a cursed shore champ train I joined on NA the other day. Got a good 15 champion marks before I left, and it couldn’t have taken that long. But it isn’t scaling events that gets you Champions there. With a group that big staying in the map that long you’re gonna get hit with diminishing returns anyways. Instead look for Champions that are guaranteed to spawn due to events.
---
I'm not 100% sure if it works together
---
We agreed to post this because you can't skip anything there: even if you skip first cultists - nothing is going to happen because you MUST kill them in order to progress through fractal. Also, it wouldn't even make sense to skip them because it takes way more time to skip than to kill :D
---
Looks like this raptor has, risen.
---
Also Top stats should not be a thing... It's so frustrating not to get one, even if you did a good job.
---
Hope there won't be hardstuck MO again :D
---
Lol, engineer is so unloved that at least half of all guides dont even mention it at all
---
This, and all panels should be collapsed by default.
---
You better get used to it, because this is a common design pattern you will find in GW2 again and again.
---
Nothing changed if you use a bag opener. The containers only drop unidentified gear at level 80, so if you opened them on a lower level character, you'll still get already-identified, appropriate level gear.
---
anet is making reminders for conference about 2h story content so... yes
---
&gt; Honestly, you’re gonna need a guild. if you are not a guild kinda guy just forget about raids. 
---
I'm not in a Guild, but went from 0 Li to over 200 just this year,
---
&gt; training groups with pugs will frustrate you to the point of not wanting to try it anymore. 
---
They helped me a lot, i actually lead 0 li training runs nowadays so new players can get the same experience i got.
---
Believe it or not, most of the people doing it tend to be having a lot of fun, and it's very satisfying to get the kill.
---
&gt; or just fake some KPs. 
---
You could probably do this later, but definitely not when starting out.
---
If you've managed to finish W1 a bunch of times forexample, and are completely comfortable with all the mechanics, then sure... go ahead and fake Li to get into that "100Li" group... There won't really be a big difference between you and them anyways.
---
Faking the KP as a means to start off is a horrible idea though, cause you'll be ruining the experience for the other 9 people.
---
Same here! GW2 is honestly the most satisfying game I've tried for it. You should see some of the crazy stuff I've been to on this game :D
---
Thank you!
---
its boring as fuck and a good advertisment for anet to stop developing more raids.
---
the groups are also trash.
---
&gt; it’s simply something you level up and has no personalization to it.
---
I'm saying that that is exactly what it's supposed to do. Personalization comes from gear and builds. Not masteries. The mastery system hasn't failed to fulfill it's goal. You just don't like what it's goal was to begin with.
---
&gt;As far as horizontal versus vertical, I’ve always thought of vertical systems in MMOs as relating to gaining levels. That’s your primary vertical progression. The horizontal system in Rift was a long term system which allowed small choices which sacrificed other choices, for a degree of character customization. It’s was more comparable to a finer grain extension of the build/trait system we have already, but offering little tweaks to strive for.
---
Vertical is statistical increases. Such as better gear or levels. Horizontal prgression is an increase in your available toolkit. This can either be in the form of quality of life and utility (eg. mounts and gliding.) or visuals (eg. new skins, spell effects, auras, legendaries etc.)
---
Vertical progression makes you stronger. Horizontal gives you more options.
---
If two players of equal skill where to compete the one who has completed more vertical progression would win. Rifts system as you describe it is a vertical one. Just because you have a choice in what buffs to get does not mean a person who is never offered that choice is equallly as strong.
---
Whoa i never knew you guys were all a part of the same guild. You guys really helped me out with all these daily jumping puzzles. ty &lt;3
---
Congragulation! ^^
---
Anet isnt posting anything here on this sub
---
they are making reminders in their comfort zone, though; if you don't like the content of this sub you can leave it every day :)
---
Does Teapot have a choice? He can't stay in a game which will be officially dead on 30th August.
---
Riba meta? I've never heard this in my 7 years playing
---
RIBA is a popular way of farming the Silverwastes, see: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dWkzTe4BnptuCJRpg2nyuNKsO1r7MZBULZoIuKieyUo/edit#slide=id.p
---
Was working fine about a month ago. Did you participate in all the events in your lane leading up to the fight inside the tree? Did you get gold participation in the event? 
---
When I did it I stayed in the outer circle, I didn’t fight the boss. Just use some build with swiftness and teleports or leaps and tag all the mordrem preservers and blighting pods. 
---
If that doesn’t work, then it’s bugged. Use the ingame bug report system, check the progress blocked option, and support SHOULD just give you the trophy
---
A bug I did experience was on a further down the line collection where you have to interact with the raven in the Balthazar hero point in Auric Basin. The raven only spawns for a while after you kill the champion there, but the event had bugged. It was up but the champion was nowhere to be found. I did find out, though, that you can “kill” the fire surrounding the hero point using skills that are able to hit enemies under the ground, like thief shortbow 4. Like 3 shots later I “killed” the fire and the raven spawned.
---
Yep I do! That's another video plan for the future. For the time being I can leave you with this though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIyeIRdwoqo
---
That is currently the highest point I've managed in the fractal, still trying to figure out how to get across to where I failed in the video though...
---
Yeah there's a lot of really neat places you can get to in this fractal! It's quite the playground. The part above the end boss area is very deceiving though, I got a little too excited because it looked like a mini jumping puzzle then I fell due to no collision on something. It's right around the airship
---
5.4k viewers is pretty crazy for a gw2 stream.. even today.
---
&gt; Which means we're only losing 1 player.
---
Classic is going to take many thousands in 2 days, and depending on how Anet's announcement goes in 5 days, we GW2 lose far more.
---
WoW and GW have always had a very distinct playerbase. 
---
Most players left one game for the other due to the different nature of games. 
---
Sure some people will leave GW2 for WoW, but depending on the announcement, we may also get some back. 
---
I think your *thousands* is a heavy exaggeration.
---
I have had the game since launch and the highest I have is 82% on my necro
---
Well, whatever man. You can white knight their mastery system all you want, but many of us see it as an unfulfilled promise. It’s nothing more than time gating necessary mechanics tied to each expansion. I’m fine with that, as I feel that the game needs more goals to work towards, but the system certainly could have been much more interesting if they had woven real choices into it, in addition to the necessary mechanical upgrades. 
---
They did, in the beginning, have aspirations to make real character choices be part of the game (such as the branching dialogue choices which still exist in the story, but have no effect on anything), but unfortunately they’ve never followed though on that promise.
---
So you're saying that, if I send all of my unidentified gear drops to my bag opener to open, ALL metas technically can be used to salvage those mats now?
---
Who is saying that? Why would an entire community quit because of one streamer leaving for a different setting. 
---
That's beyond ridiculous.
---
It's only a question of teapot not hosting any events anymore, another hardcore guild cam pick up the banner.
---
Oh I do miss that system it felt more rewarding for some reason
---
GW2 is losing nothing! The raid community in this game is loud but very small.
---
Anet makes most of the money through living world content. That was always the main feature.
---
You will still get raid content. But it won't change! Live with it or move on.
---
Nah. I think all we need is more people playing Living World. :) Definitely the best thing for GW2's future. 
---
Keepo
---
This event is amazing. Teapot is doing a masterful job. Gw2 really is losing a lot.
---
It does in PvP and WvW, which is why ANet spoke out against the tool in the past. Iirc it was also very hard to detect if people were actively using it or not.
---
thanks so much!
---
woodenpotatoes is sticking around, Deroir, MMOINKs, Krytan Herald as well as Teapot he has said he is moving to WoW classic yes but has never said he is completely quitting GW2 he has said he won't play it every day like he does now because it burns him out. Your acting like this is the last time he'll ever play GW but even he has said that when he leaves for WoW classic GW2 will remain installed.
---
They're not leaving because teapot is leaving, they're leaving because ANet barely supports modes that are not open world, despite constant promises of the opposite. They (and a lot of other people) are sick of that and jumping ship. 1 raid per year is not enough to satisfy anyone but the most casual of raiders, and they've also dropped in difficulty quite harshly.
---
Most of these players also said they are leaving, and the event has the highest prizepool and the lowest amount of entrants so far. Guilds had to combine to even get 10 people.
---
You can build condi scourge around that trait, it's even a meta choice on a single raid boss. But please don't bring that to fractals.
---
People aren't quitting because teapot is. They're quitting for the same reasons.
---
*their
---
:duck: POST  :duck: THESE  :duck: DUCKS  :duck: TO  :duck: HELP  :duck: THESE  :duck: CUCKS :duck:  ^^:D
---
I hope you can see why that would be the absolute worst decision ever.
---
Imagine two teams, l33t and n00b. Team l33t immediately starts stomping, and soon the score is 400-10.
---
Teem l33t then _backs off the points_, allowing team n00b to catch up, because doing so will both give team l33t **more** points (for a close win). Team n00b goes along with it, of course, because they'll lose **fewer** points (for a close loss).
---
So team l33t gets +50, and team n00b gets -5, all because they coordinated their scores for mutual benefit. There's minimal risk, because even if team l33t somehow loses control and throws the match, they'll lose very little Elo compared to the massive benefit they get for their wins. 
---
Never mind that, if l33t and n00b are actually win-trading, the two teams can now wintrade _profitably_, getting _both_ teams up to the highest ranks by alternating who wins. Hilariously, this means that the win traders can get their elo high enough that they guarantee nobody else will be able to compete, so they'll always get queued up against one another, thus making their wintrading even more efficient.
---
The system _needs_ to be zero-sum, or at least close to it. If we're going with OP's suggestion that close losses should cost fewer points, we **need* to follow through with *giving* fewer points for close wins.
---
i never said he is irrelevant

You dont need to. You presented emotional benefit of his departure, proving that he has an impact on you. If he was irrelevant, you would ignore him and all threads related to him.

Making FB non-mandatory is as easy as nuking Stand Your Ground from orbit.  Everyone will hate that change though.
---
10.6
---
&gt;So yeah, open world and fractal, easy mode builds, ideas?
---
Play a meta build for group content, they really are a great place to start. Search for group comps that support the meta, ie comps that cover all the boons like a Firebrand/renegade comp with a bannerslave and 2 dps. Fractals are ez when groups put inthe effort, dont try to face tank every thing and play together. 
---
These folks have good guides and builds centered around fractals. https://discretize.eu/
---
Just fyi he hit 11k views just now. People saying GW2 ain't watchable on twitch really need to take a seat.
---
I don't know about the ice walls, but the rest looks great!
---
it's not nearly as concerning if you consider the circumstances. this is an event stream with very little if any chat interaction. the streamers themselves aren't as relevant either, but the actual visual content on the stream is, encouraging people to go fullscreen/disabling chat.
---
and then there are factors like teapot being featured on the frontpage, or this extraordinary event attracting non-regular twitch users which might not even have an account.
---
there almost certainly is viewbotting going on, but not to the extent those numbers suggest.
---
It’s the beginning of the end my friend
---
Even in GW1 you could click on a party member and spectate them after you died
---
I heard recently that ideally ,when opened by a level 50, you make 3.5 silver pet bag. If that is true, then why is this a gold farm? The bags you get in Orr sell for that much and you get 2 or 3 times as many of them for the same time played plus the value of the map rewards.
---
What do I not understand here?
---
not concerning at all.
---
## Possible Reasons for Huge Differences
---
The above tool is limited to the data available.  There are possible reasons why a channel may have more viewers than chatters.
---
**Home Page Featured**
---
Streams featured on the homepage will not have a chat box.  This means that its adding viewer numbers to the stream - but not increasing the chat count.
---
**Embedded on Web Page**
---
Some websites just show the livestream and not the chat box.  This would account for a difference in viewers to chatters.
---
**Not Logged In**
---
If a user is not logged into Twitch.tv, then the number of chatroom users does not increase.  Many people watch streams who may not have an account / not logged in.
---
**Hosted Channels**
---
With Twitch.tv's new hosted channel feature, this will cause streams to have higher viewers than chatters.
---
So it's good because it does better than mediocre, gotcha.
---
https://i.imgflip.com/38uv24.jpg
---
I'm not whiteknighting their mastery system. I don't particularly like the system. But saying that the system failed is just an innacurate critique. 
---
You want a fundamentally different system than the one anet intended to provide. You want a vertical system that rewards you with minor statistical upgrades. This is counter to their core philosophy that everyone should be on the same level no matter how long they have played. Thats why we don't have a gear treadmill. They dileberately wanted to get away from the standard mmo progression of peppering essentially meaningless stat upgrades to keep people playing.
---
&gt; They did, in the beginning, have aspirations to make real character choices be part of the game (such as the branching dialogue choices which still exist in the story, but have no effect on anything), but unfortunately they’ve never followed though on that promise.
---
The original story has plenty of choices that effect huge sweeping differences in the story. Your race, your choices at character select. Your choice of order. Choices within individual missions on how to approach certain encounters etc. Have you even played the story?
---
It was completely untenable because the amount of branches essentially made the vast majority of work unseen by the average player. Thats why they stopped doing that. Because the story suffered, and focusing on a single consistent narrative allows them more time to flesh it out.
---
&gt; The fact that the game doesn't have a spectate feature for PvE built in is ridiculous.
---
Can you name a single other mmo that has that feature?
---
WvW, possibly the biggest disappointment in my many years of gaming.
---
Now imagine if Anet officially suported this and gave tools to the organizers
---
&gt; 12k+
---
So, almost 6% of this subreddit.
---
Have you heard of any of these people? 
---
This is an overall reflection of how little ArenaNet has done to help most people out.  The extent that they embrace and support a content creator is basically just a small, benign shoutout on the "streaming schedule" announcement on the official website.  You have to be pretty much a giant to be mentioned on guild-chat; so I can't really say that anyone other than WoodenPotatoes or AuroraPeachy have really had the honor.  
---

(Tossing in: **BogOtter,** **The Krytan Herald** and **Aurora Peachy** or **AyinMaiden** for posterity)
---
Most of these were at one point or another common guests on Tea Time.  Most of players that I haven't highlighted are end-game raid focused players that I would expect to be less well known by the community (eg; Nico / Van Gherwen or Mela &amp; Roca).  
---
This really just highlights what a poor job ArenaNet has done supporting all but the most general communities.  Sure, there's BenP doing his damndest to support the competitive PvP/WvW communities, but he feels like ArenaNet's "Atlas." myth.  
---
* Deroir is general player; used to really upkeep a bunch of really high quality Fractal of the Mist guides via KING.  
---
* Shinryuku is a PvP/WvW Roamer; very aggressive, but well-mannered Warrior player.  Mostly gone? 
---
* Jebro was involved with ESL Casting and still has a small following of PvP related players. 
---
* Sam Ajeste is a Ranger main that does a lot of trading post speculation and economy videos. 
---
* Nike is almost the "face" of the endgame PvE community; a PvE Warrior main / DnT.  
---
* Kit the Traveler: is a well traveled casual player that did fun giveaways, well known in recent years.  
---
* Lord Helseth: The most arrogant mesmer persona to ever grace sPVP; obnoxious "in character." 
---
* Roy: one of the prominent PvP/WvW community organizers; GodsofPvP(?) players. 
---
* WP: Do I even really have to talk about WP? He is the optimistic saint of GW2 overall. 
---
* BogOtter: a generalist alongside Aurora Peachy; mostly maintains their own communities. 
---
* KrytanHerald: various class guides, generalist content; one of the more recent content creators. 
---
* AyinMaiden: The closest thing to a "Dulfy" alternative. Mild-mannered, very friendly.
---
I am confused your saying that playing efficiently and in a smart manner based on rewards compared to mindless farming not only feels better but gets you more gold?  I dont get it I never liked farming maps just for gold so I have always done it the other way or via tp flipping.
---
It even passed 11K at peak time. Will see how many there are at the final.
---
10k views without any support from the company itself. 
---
statement
---
So what if you and a couple friends just want to do the daily for the bonus boxes? You have a extra set(s) of eyes to find a champ faster, then you hop to the next region boons daily done for 5 tokens (more depending on the champ/event) thats a extra box. 
---
The worldboss rush was only "better" than champ rush because you could multi map and do the same world boss 1-5 times depending on your load time and setup.
---
That's amazing, against all odds too.
---
Almost 8 times as much as the actual active users on this subreddit.

So how would this be measured if I'm not registered on twitch? I wouldn't be a user in chatroom, cause I wouldn't have a name to uniquely identify me.

I mean... they turned out correct, didn't they ;) ?
---
Instead of being mad about players being negative, maybe you should ask why they are negative towards a game they put a lot of hours in and used to love.
---
The current system encourages people to log in daily or convert gems to gold, both to anet’s benefit
---
A bit of a different type of game, but BDO allows you to turn on spectate camera after death in node war / sieges (large scale PvP). I don't play 50 other MMOs so don't expect me to give you a list here.

&gt; When's the last time you saw a balance patch update from Snow Crows? 
---
[Last](https://i.imgur.com/xbpamPX.png) [month](https://i.imgur.com/fE6Y7Yk.png). Just because it isn't posted on Reddit or shouted from the high heavens, as Teapot likes to do to draw attention to himself, doesn't mean it isn't happening.
---
&gt; That goes to show you.  
---
I think it goes to show you actually. You aren't keeping up to date with the sites, I am not sure if you actively play the content - maybe you do. Just because many of us aren't part of the Twitch sub-community and instead we are spend our time in the game, rather than watching other people play, doesn't mean that things aren't happening.
---
&gt; The same happened to PvP &amp; WvW, now it's endgame PvE 
---
It has been endgame PvE since the summer of 2016 and the long wait between Stronghold of the Faithful and Bastion of the Penitent. Many of us having been raising this as an issue since then. I guess it is easier to be drawn into streamer-led drama, that is being used to promote *themselves* and not the game, rather than critically thinking about *why*, three years after the release cadence was implemented and two years after PoF, that this has suddenly become a major issue.
---
It is the discovery panel.  All usable things are already highlighted.
---
Mine is blank.
---
Would be nice for dungeons to not be dead content again but unless they gated how many trades you can make per day the TP will always be king, even if fractals/dailies got nerfed.
---
You know there is a difference between a big expansion release announcement after long content dry and a tournament created by the community without anets support.
---
was it the last ERP? i hope so. all these elitism crying babies.
---
"we need more raids"

"we need more difficulty modes"
---
... go and play wow
---
as i understand it, he will be streaming classic wow pretty soon in place of his usual gw2 content, but he will still be on gw2 from time to time, just not as often now that he has basically exhausted himself on what raiding content is available in the game. i do hope he sticks around to make general content videos, because it doesnt seem like he is done with the game, but just that he doesnt feel there is much for him to stream to his viewers right now that he hasnt already, with the rate of content his viewers tune into him for being released very slowly.
---
You want them to advertise......self motivated farming optimization patterns? what?
---
Those who do that do it because they like it but it's not content by itself. Also if harder content was motivated why do I only get 2 gold to kill a raid boss once a week....oh wait this game is super casual and having scaled rewards for challenging content would cause riots.
---
The only thing forcing rewards to be irrelevant is business model. Game is fueled by microtransactions, therefore it cant offer too much rewards through gameplay.
---
Exactly, that's why this is so insane. He's just showing that.
---
Which they will, and they'll quickly find out what classic WoW was like only it will be seen through the veneer of 2019 MMO design rather than it being a wonder-filled world as it was back in 2004.
---
I'm looking forward to the surprise that is awaiting people that didn't play through WoW the first time and have no idea how the game does nothing to serve their ideas of what they want an MMO to be.
---
Thanks for the summary! :)
---
We should treat this as one of the last gifts teapot makes to this game..
---
And how anet just neglects a lot of the communities effort to make their game grow
---
pretty sure that had more than 48k viewers
---
100%, the camera app has been a hit and allowed people to see the actual fights rather than a visual mess from first person camera, 
---
Along with the radio silence from Anet as usual, that good PR they could have had from this will be turned into negative PR due to the fact everyone will know Anet completely ignored this, it shows what they are really like, they will never learn, nothing will ever change.
---
Hmm, to say that to a neutral valid comment is typical from the adrenaline junkie side-shows.
---
Lmao. I was definitely speaking about them posting on reddit with their detailed threads for the community rather than their website/discord. Actually I had kept up for a long time with their websites and discord and is especially why I meant the reddit posts because they never posted detailed resumes like they did on reddit. I understand how you misunderstood my comment but you didn't 'gotcha' me like you think you did lol. 
---
Dear. You think you're teaching me about the history of this game and hardcore communities? It has nothing to do with streamer drama. I have actively participated in the hardcore communities lol.
---
&gt; This really just highlights what a poor job ArenaNet has done supporting all but the most general communities. 
---
Very few of those people actively post content. I follow them on Twitter. When they do post content, it tends to be heavily promoted by Arenanet on social media with multiple retweets and replies. This has happened recently for Deroir, KrytanHerald and Kroof (who you miss out, but okay) and probably many others since I'm not that active on Twitter.
---
I am not sure why there is this idea that promotion doesn't occur. It absolutely does. It just seems like Anet are currently not wanting to promote partners that encourage negative behaviour or post speculative videos with respect to the workings of the community.
---
That seems pretty reasonable to me.
---
umad
---
not when you can trust the statistic sites...i am talking about peak viewers, not total.  
---
one month before hot release they had a 19k peak on twitch, guess that was some anouncement.
---
They're running a game company and you're sitting on your fatass telling them to violate their own policy lol. They already gave him the green light to do it with no repercussions, and the teasalt fanbois are still whining that they want anet to officially endorse it for god knows what.
---
Beautiful, lets drop it to &lt; 900 again for the rest of the year. Sad to see this game unused like a catholic pornstash.
---
&gt; but they rarely do anything for the overall community. 
---
And how does this event do anything for the overall community? What beneficial impact does it have to watch 54 people try hard mode content? Does it help the people currently in LFG for raid CMs, the people looking for people to join training raids? Does it increase awareness about groups that are recruiting or what is currently happening in game?
---
I'd probably fall under the guise of a hardcore raider according to this sub, and even when I enjoyed Teapot's streams before he fished for drama and ignored the toxic elements of his fans, I didn't bother with the ERP streams. There is a lot more enjoyment to be had with playing the game, in my opinion, and if I was to follow something competitive at the same time, it would likely be some sportsball of sorts. 
---
I am sure this event is absolutely great for people that are already invested in the whole Twitch ecosystem but for those of us that care more about the game, it really isn't that impactful. It is catering to the 1% (Twitch viewers) of the 1% (raiders).
---
An AuroraPeachy stream where I can turn up and participate in world completion or events with the streamer? Yeah. That is a touch more fun.
---
In fairness, a significant part of the reason they do this is because this is the "game type" that the majority of the community itself adopted as "what Guild Wars 2 is all about."
---
ArenaNet didn't coin "Fashion Wars 2."
---
Anet's focus is casuals.  Casuals who want to log in, do a world boss maybe and buy skins and then log off.  
---
Despite having hands down the best combat system within the MMO genre arguably, they've failed to give any focus at all to the game modes who would use it the best, and instead most focus has been on casual content which is including Living Story stuff.
---
WvW is in a negative feedback loop these days with the number of guilds leaving and quitting, sPVP is more or less just an entire joke especially when it comes to core issues they've just flat out ignored (win trading etc.) and raid content gets content barely ever.
---
I have to think it's not Anet being lazy, it's because adding content to this game is just tremendously difficult.  Or maybe there's just a clear lack of game direction -- I think losing Collin years ago we never really got a Game Director / Decision Maker that could drive the same vision.
---
Lets ask people with different taste to select a nice face for my stabby girl.

PoF announcement had over 50k concurrent viewers.

You're right, i give it a try. Thanks!
---
I have a heal scrapper set that is mostly minstrel, with a handful of harrier's pieces. It's definitely not meta, but it's pretty fun and has it's moments when it can shine. 
---
I personally love healing t4 Siren's Reef on it. Not being sarcastic, I actually love that fractal just because scrapper heals on it is fun, and I usually ask to swap roles with my static's druid when we get it (I typically play daredevil).

Haven't played it much since the last scrapper changes- I know they lost a good chunk of health, but minstrel scrapper can still take a lot of punishment. 
---
People's obsession with meta takes a lot of fun out of the game imo. I get wanting to optimize groups, but I think many people just take it too far. Scrapper is fun, go try it out and see if you like it regardless of it's less than perfect status for fractal healing.
---
&gt; no idea how the game does nothing to serve their ideas of what they want an MMO to be.
---
Sounds like it doesn't serve *your* idea. Stop projecting.
---
Classic isn't perfect, but it has things that modern MMos have lost along the way: sense of community and progression. I think classic is already a success but I agree that there will be a dropoff.
---
All I'm hoping for at this point is that classic does well enough for Blizzard to relelease the next two expansions, because those are simply better versions of classic with better player retention and gameplay.
---
So spamming LFG with direct link adverts to websites where you can reserve times to buy raid kills is fine, but doing something nice for people for free that involves an instance after forming a group is not.
---
Congrats, that's literally one of the most retarded things you or anyone else at ANET has decided, and there's been a LOT of ideas on that list.
---
It's not that it's not watchable on Twitch, but with Anet's attitude towards Twitch in general it's not going to thrive. There are often times where Guild Wars 2 has a total viewership below 100 people.
---
I think he means "playable" with in-game streaming.
---
it's not like GW2 is way better at fashion than other MMOs anyway. If you look at /r/ffxiv, like half their front page is usually fanart/fashion/housing, but they still have a healthy raid community.
---
Hylek discrimination! RRREEEEEE
---
&gt;I think it's also worth considering the type of community that has built around this event (and MightyTeapot's stream, or people generally concerned about difficult instanced content in GW2). There is an intense air of passive aggression, outright aggression, and unconstructivie cynicism towards the game, its creators and the rest of the GW2 community from several of the most vocal people commenting
---
I'm already counting the time until we get another comment from the Twitch side of things about the "friendliest community". I personally lost interest in Teapot when his fanbase doubled down on the less than pleasant comments and he didn't bother doing anything about it. The whole *wink wink nudge nudge* aspect to his comments about what *not* to do have been tiring, his mining reddit for drama even more so and the dogwhistling he does by calling out people he disagrees with on stream, because he misinterprets comments, isn't pleasant to be on the receiving end of.
---
It is also a shame so many people have been fooled with his "criticism" of the game and the release rate for raids. Something that people have been commenting on when it became a problem initially. In summer 2016. Three years ago. Funny that it only becomes an issue that someone will shout about when they want to leave the game.
---
Anyway, I think your post is spot on. It is a shame that it is being downvoted but, for all the people that have suggested this sub is an echo chamber for positivity, here is your proof that it is an echo chamber for certain streamers.
---
losing a game with the same people in your team from previous game (that you also lost) should give lesser rating loss
---
These kinds of opinions are 100% why this game is infested with "don't make me try" casuals and everyone who actually wants a challenging game has left.  Casual apologist communities are just the aids of any PC game where there are competitive game modes.
---
&gt; therefore it cant offer too much rewards through gameplay
---
This isn't the case, just the way they've let it become, The game just doesn't have anything meaningful as a reward because it doesn't have power progression and its horizontal progression stopped/stalled a long time ago. 
---
They could add different ways you mount, housing, fishing, skill trees to change your base core skills there's countless shit they could do to make the game better and then tie  a reward to it they just have to actually do it. 
---
Thing is when a harvesting tool can make you the same money expansions make why the fuck make the content if people will buy the tools?(the answer is obvious  because your game will die or be shallow but a business isnt going to look at it that way)
---
So what you are saying is, the problem is business model.
---
and almost all of them watching the ERP
---
&gt; Imagine if Anet embraced the combat system and developed more content that pushes it instead of trying to pass GW2 off as some glorified antisocial dressup game for furries.
---
Isn't that what raids are? I mean, can you honestly say there is less hardcore content in GW2 today than there was in the game 7 years ago? 
---
I would argue that the platter of content that GW2 offered in the last year is easily more inclusive of more difficult content than what it offered in the first three years. Harder fractals than the original dungeons (and the original fractals) and the existence of raids at all.
---
If you're arguing that less open world maps and story content and more raids would result in more players, well I think ArenaNet's metrics answer that question better for them, atlhough we can get a hint from GW2efficiency's tracker showing how few people have completed each of the more recent raid kill achievements compared to how many did each of the new story episodes.
---
It does show. Official streams tend to get more views anyway if they're announts, cause it's a short reveal that's usually hype for most people.
---
WvW community uses to stream gvgs and i think this camera tool woupd benefit them massively but i dont think they've ever been supported by anet.
---
It wouldn't be a middle finger if they stopped acting like children and actually started supporting their own goddamn product.
---
Someone needs to tell them the year is 2019, and that streamers are actually a thing; an important one, for that matter.
---
Your comment would be valid if the the issue wasn't already confirmed by hundreds of players that actually play the game mode.
---
Pretending that all subscribed accounts are actively participating in this subreddit, let alone the actual game is what's disingenuous here.
---
&gt; Teapot leaving is a nail in the coffin
---
I don't think you know what that expression means.  Look, I love challenging content as well but the bottom line is we're a small minority of the player base and a smaller number than that even know who teapot is.
---
Difference being that there is no group PvE in that game and PvP is it's pinnacle game mode.
---
This event just showed that there is a desperate need for this feature in GW2, there is literally not a single reason not to implement it, the code is already there and effort required is down to a minimum. GW2 is almost non-existent in the streaming community and this is a major reason for it aswell. It's just not comfortable to watch under normal circumstances.
---
By your definition only the hardcore group of any activity would watch said activity. Just going back to my experience with friends and family watching sports on the tv, you are plain wrong.
---
Cute try kiddo. ;)
---
its dutch for viewers xd
---
Posted my own opinion in another thread.
---
A coffin has many nails.
---
Which is a pretty odd situation for anyone that actually played WoW back in 2004 and the following years.
---
The raiding content is beyond simple and is very quick to cause exhaustion, either through brick wall wipes or having things cleared and just needing to farm content you find very easy to gear people up in preparation for the next release.
---
I loved WoW and raided heavily towards the end of vanilla through to Cataclysm. However, it isn't something that will magically provide more raiding content to sate people that are unhappy with what is on offer in GW2. If the want to raid more was truly a legitimate reason, then BfA is a far better option with quicker release rates, more content currently available and variable difficulties.
---
Companies can't just go against their own terms of service. They're running a company, if they compromise then they cant properly enforce it. Furthermore, isn't it better that anet isn't officially supporting it so teasalt and his ilk gets to talk shit about the devs and goad his audience into shitting on the game nonstop on stream?
---
I've lost faith in ANet's ability to fix ANYTHING since that AMA where they admitted to not knowing how their own google maps-like map works, and when they couldn't fix a bug in BF so they made it into an achievement.
---
living world is what killed gw slowly.. people come back, play it a week and leave for another 3-5 months. thats not what i would call healthy and active community
---
I understand why Anet doesn't want to endorse something using third party mod tools, but it blows my mind how they willingly allow every single opportunity like this to go right by them.
---
&gt; I think Anet truly messed everything up by not continuing with dungeons. 
---
100% agreed.
---
In order to show my love to u/boottspurr I have to say Mad King Runes.
---
The key difference is that XIV had a healthy does of end game at (re)launch. By the time ANet realized it needed more, Fashion Wars had already been born and a was learning how to walk.
---
As somebody playing both GW2 and XIV, XIV also has *far more raids* to be a healthy community over.
---
GW2's raiding is heavily criticized for a *reason*.
---
gw1 isn't an MMORPG
---
I like comboing that elite skill effect with the ranger elite that summons brambles.  It hits so many people around you and you can stack some extra damage with the birds.
---
As someone who loggs in maybe twice a week I do agree with some of his criticism though. Nowadays I mostly play open world content but a Living World episode every 3-4 months is certainly not ideal, especially when the map that releases with it doesn't really have much replayability or any cool things to get (Tpot criticises this lack of content for open world and the fact that most, if not all, cool things are only obtained through the gemstore as much as he criticises thelack of harder content in the game).
---
Also the casual crowd (this might be a bad descriptor as I already said in another comment since I am very much a casual) has been toxic towards content creators like Tpot or other people that don't agree with them for a while now.
---
Same reason you aren't allowed to select every single stat point on your gear. Same reason you aren't allowed to run every single specialisation.
---
I think GW2 actually has too high a focus on personalisation. Because it makes balance incredibly difficult. Compared to wow and ffxiv, gw2 has extremely high amounts of customizabillity. Which means the ratio between good builds and bad builds becomes skewed. There is a lot of choice, but choice also requires assesment. 
---
Anet relies on poeple too make suboptimal choices. Thats why open world content is so incredibly easy, because the vast majority of players are not able to successfully parse the systems adequately.
---
Compare that to ffxiv. Every single dark knight plays exactlyt the same. You can still be bad at the game. But you can't be fundamentally wrong. As long as you equip the gear with the highest score, put on grit and aoe, you can succeed at tanking a dungeon. No need to go online and find a build, no need to practice how to play it, no need to get the correct gear and runes. 
---
If you ask a new player to build a boon chrono and then pilot it through a t1 fractal they would be nowhere near the same level of relative effectiveness as a new dark knight.
---
Secondly, introducing a choice inherently forces you to choose something at the expense of another. Would the mastery system be better if you could only choos 1 or 2 of the mounts? Is there a reason it is better to have choices than just getting everything?
---
Choices allow players to express themselves. But forcing them to make choices they need to make, such as choosing between masteries leads to a suboptimal experience.
---
So why not add more options and more vectors for personalisation? Because it inherently obscures systems and negatively impacts ease of use. And because introducing new content, and then forcing players to choose what content they experience unessecarily is how we get another zhaitan arc.
---
Sure you can argue that if the choices are minor enough to where they are not impacting either of these issues, then there shouldn't be a problem. But if the choices don't matter enough to have any impact in either of these two categories, then why even have them to begin with?
---
I do agree he sure is milking his leaving. The constant threads about it have only soured me on this person who I never even heard of prior.  What's ironic is I raid too lol.
---
Don't worry. Even blizzard knows that WoW Classic is going to crash and burn shortly after release. That's why they have so few servers set up.
---
Excellent sleuthing. From memory, yeah it's about 25%
---
How to become a TP Baron? If it were easy, everyone would do it xD
---
is this still meta?
---
You can farm for as many hours as you want, there's no limit. You can only do what you describe once a day for maximum profit. If you only have one hour to play, there's no contest as to what is more profitable, but if you play for more than 2 hours a day...
---
Aha.... your mother must be very proud of you.
---
Very very nice :)
---
^^^^where ^^^^is ^^^^the ^^^^spot ^^^^to ^^^^ERP?
---
it is in direct conflict, but they're not gonna ban them because it would lead to PR nightmare and game would die today instead of in 5 days /jk kimora
---
and you posted this, why?
---
Are you really surprised you got banned for the N-word?
---
&gt; And you're too fixated on raids. The overwhelming majority of players want to play on PvP servers, the game reservatons clearly show that. PvP has near infinite replayability and is highly community driven. 
---
And here I was thinking that this thread was about a raid event and a streamer that is leaving due to the lack of raids? Silly me...
---
&gt; You're not the type of person who understands what the game has lost and how. It's pointless to try explaining because it means nothing to you. 
---
Sure! Of course! I mean, not like I've been active on this sub or pointing out the faults of the game for [a while](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/74up84/raid_and_instanced_pve_balance_in_gw2_is_poor_and/). If you don't want to engage with my points on a reasonable level, then block me and move on. It is clear you've painted an idea of who I am in your head and that you don't want to consider anything to the contrary. I understand that. It is a touch easier when you choose to consider only the points of people that agree with you.
---
*"Glorified antisocial dress-up game for furries?"*
---
Mhm. So, I'm a furry, I have social anxiety problems, and I enjoy style and colour theory. I have spent hours "dressing up" my charr character. I want him to look fabulous... I *also* have 295 MP, I have played PvP, I have done fractals, raiding, 100% map completion. Lead a few squads, ran guild missions. I play the game same as you, who are you to judge me?
---
I'm so sick of dealing with this generalization, at *least* once a week I have to put up with this shit. Is it really so hard to live and let live?
---
Also deincentivizes unhealthy play styles, like 10 hour sessions.
---
I bought from Brazil. If you have a International card you can buy it normally. The bank will make the exchange for you (real (4,00) to dolar (1,00) at this time) and you Will be charged The exchanged vale.
---
Ex. Hot = 10,00 USD on sale. 
---
You buy it from Brazil it will cost 40,00 (aprox). The bank will charge you 40,00.
---
Simple as that. But aways check the dolar value!
---
Also some banks may charge the dolar value in the end of the month and not at the moment of the transaction.
---
I've re-installed the game a bunch in the past several months, so it took me a moment, but that's what he means, I think.
---
But the person asked for a MMO reference, not a MMORPG one.
---
When U hit 80 lvl the real fun begins. ;)
---
Is he really quitting the game or it's a just a curent private joke fore a strong break of the game while playing classic wow ?
---
This is truly gorgeous. I used to have a roleplay group and we decorated our Lost Precipice in a similar way - taking practicality and realism to heart. It doesn't exist anymore, but I'm so happy to see someone else's imagination take form.

&gt; Do you actually read the snowcrows discord? ... For a long ass time now. Or how a bunch have moved to final fantasy already and others waiting for the announcement to know if they stay or leave. 
---
Nah, of course I don't read the Discord! Why, that isn't why I linked you a screenshot of a discussion that I am aware of, because I am in the Discord and reading it!
---
Goodness.
---
Yes, I am also waiting for the announcement myself. I hope it contains something good. However, I don't lie to myself that GW2 ever catered to the sort of content that I enjoy. The raid release cadence has been this way since summer 2016 after all. I hope more will be announced, if it isn't, then I'll move on. But pretending this game is something it never was is disingenuous.
---
&gt;  I'm absolutely certain I'm right for having talked with individuals of the hardcore communities, longer than this recent drama lol. 
---
Good for you! You also thought you were right about SnowCrows not releasing balance updates before you completed changed the point you wanted to make.

Login gold is about conditioning people into some simple, yet effective habits.  It gets them to login, and are more likely to stay logged in for a few activities, maybe shell out some $$$ for gems etc.  
---
It's healthy.  Those activities require more investment, awareness and skill than open world farming.  Open world farming is something I've found entirely revolting -- it's basically just spamming auto-attack; low-effort/high-reward loot simulator.  I don't like it when farms like that are so highly profitable because then there's zero incentive to get better at the game or have more varied experiences.
---
Doesn't twitch ban for using or even mentioning those? They're extremely sensitive and politically correct, even worse than Blizzard and default reddit subs.
---
What do ARP and ERP mean?
---
This completely ignores the various content droughts and community outcry when all development is living world. This has happened at least 3 times in those 7 years.
---
gw2 had decent numbers when there were spvp tournament but it seems that arenanet dgaf about twitch number...
---
"joke"
---
Comparing that to a fully community driven event is a very long stretch
---
Season 1 releases took longer than three hours to grind out and came out every two weeks not three months.
---
&gt;But I mean it in a completely neutral way. He brought nothing to the game
---
that doesn't sound neutral or objective, if you were to rationally measure what he brought to the game you wouldn't say "nothing" even if you disliked him. we could say his event brought discussion, drama, entertainment for few thousand ppl. even mere existence of this thread and your comment confirm it.
---
&lt;3
---
:thinking:
---
Well,  for me it'll be Euros and PLN. But I see what you mean, thanks for the advice.
---
Well, knowing that it's intentional makes it much more funny. Honestly haven't been keeping up with the game for very long, and reddit decided that this should reach my front page.
---
Well, I was completing Lion's Arch with an alt so I accidentally found a strange "Evon" Gnashblade under the Deverol Gardens POI.
---
The character does not seem to recognize him as the real Evon and they talk about it in the interaction.
---
ps: I don't usually use forums but I thought it would be important to inform.
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deverol\_Gardens](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deverol_Gardens)
---
No what's super popular on this reddit is the exact opposite.  A bunch of whining about pvp and raids (a lot valid imo).
---
That was needlessly rude. Also, Jed was taken, so there's that.
---
Unfortunately the living world is a steaming pile of dogshit since PoF, both story and map wise. It's not going to get better either, Anet teasered in their "roadmap" that they are possibly just revamping old maps. Also seems like the focus will be jormag, so we're going to be babysitting brain dead Braham, this also means the story will be even worse.
---
So yes, don't worry, people will be moving on and if the announcement is shit, they will never look back. Have fun 11111 world bosses and buying overpriced skins in a game that will shutdown in less than 5 years from now and be replaced by a mobile p2w version.
---
Well if you read the discords then you wouldn't talk like they care the same. 
---
&gt;However, I don't lie to myself that GW2 ever catered to the sort of content that I enjoy. The raid release cadence has been this way since summer 2016 after all. I hope more will be announced, if it isn't, then I'll move on. But pretending this game is something it never was is disingenuous.

????????????
---
&gt; Good for you! You also thought you were right about SnowCrows not releasing balance updates before you completely changed the point you wanted to make.
---
oh
---
&gt;People aren't being doom &amp; gloom out of nowhere, the hardcore groups of this game are aggressively bleeding out right now. When's the last time you saw a balance patch update from Snow Crows? and qT before that? Have you seen a hardcore guild pick up that banner? That goes to show you.
---
&gt;(that hardcore guilds are leaving and not giving a shit anymore and the specific example of qt/sc was about their detailed posts but you got hard stuck on the technicality of my words)
---
If you want to keep being hardstuck on me not saying specifically that I meant their detailed posts on balance patch, be my guest but I've been pretty clear and this isn't me changing my tune like you are implying.

not even a screenshot of the 12k viewers FeelsWeirdMan

Just a couple questions so we can help you out:
---
- What content have you already done?  What did you enjoy?
---
- What type of content are you looking for?  PvP or PvE?  Casual or raids?  All of the above?
---
Help us help you.
---
Imagine if GW2 embraced an incredibly talented community and did something that EQ2 and others offered like player studio except they actually did it right instead of screwing the content creators.  It sucks that they lack vision  and really care enough to think outside of the box.
---
He said and i quote "I will log into the game for 2 hours every 2 months, because that's the way it's supposed to be played"
---
already a goal for me
---
But I am a broke boy
---
It's too bad the combat system is flawed at its foundation, preventing the skill ceiling from being raised any further. There's only so hard the game can be when every class gets on-demand iframes, move while casting almost everything, support is applied passively in AoE, and you get an extremely forgiving safety net with downed state.
---
They would need to start by disabling dodge and downed state, giving healers a combat rez for defeated allies, buffing ranged weapon damage while forcing them to stand still most of the time, and so on. But that'll never happen, so we can't have truly hard PvE, ever.
---
Behold, GW2's most positive community:
---
&gt;"Person B: "This isn't a game that's all that fun to watch on twitch and besides,  i'm not a huge fan of any of the top viewed games on twitch anyways. i've yet to buy a game because someone said it was good. or anything that i can think of. i prefer my own judgment than a mobs. so many games hyped up end up garbage i've learned"
---
He said every 3 months?! 
---
Let me correct my statement, then.
---
No, as some of the emotes are built-in. You can't use them on the GuildWars2 channel, though.
---
&gt; It were the expansions,
---
Ekhm- lootboxes, mount skins, lootboxes with mount skins -ekhm.
---
Wow, you really should learn to write properly.
---
Oh wow need to get back in game I have bought the mount expansion last time I still need to get the other one, I hope it's in sale as I have spent someone of my save money on other games, I miss this game a lot now, miss my home lions arch..
---
Can't talk to the viewers if you're prohibited from saying pretty much everything.
---
&gt; Well if you read the discords then you wouldn't talk like they care the same. 
---
I never once implied that. You stated that SnowCrows didn't post balance updates. I showed you this was incorrect. You twisted your argument and moved the goal posts. I noted that they are actively expanding their site. You took that to mean that I am implying they are happy with the state of the game. I did no such thing. You are doing an awful lot of reaching though, and an awful lot of doubling down on a point where you are incorrect.
---
&gt; ???????????? 
---
Is reading hard? I gave a personal perspective. Sometimes people do that to add to conversations. Crazy, right?!
---
&gt; oh 
---
Yeah. Hard realising that your points were expressed incorrectly and you were wrong. You'll get there.
---
&gt; If you want to keep being hardstuck on me not saying specifically that I meant their detailed posts on balance patch, be my guest but I've been pretty clear and this isn't me changing my tune like you are implying. 
---
You are changing your tune. You have been doing it throughout. People can absolutely be unhappy with the state of the game, play other things and provide criticism and still be committed to the game too. Many of us have been doing that for a while and, as much as it might come as a shock, it is natural during content releases in MMOs.
---
Anet is probably like: Let them do it. They'll leaving tomorrow anyway. Smart play on Anet.
---
It was in a tweet, dunno if it was sarcastic or not but i does line up with at least the lw schedule.
---
Holy shit how many threads are there going to be about this?  The event is cool and all but I think we've had enough.
---
Level 80 content:
---
Core game: 
---
* Map completion (okay, not really level 80 but you get scaled down)
---
* Get some exotic (orange) gear. If you're not sure, berserker's stat prefix is *probably* what you want.
---
* Silverwastes, Dry Top and Southsun
---
* Fractals - Fairly popular dungeons which get harder as you go. Start in Lion's Arch, use the LFG to find a T1 team and say you're new to them. Seriously, fractals will keep you going for a while. 
---
* WvW
---
* PvP
---
* Jumping puzzles, achievements, side stories... Have you completed all four paths on all eight dungeons?
---
Living Story S2 - get it with gems, either with gold or cash. Story based but no new maps. 
---
Heart of Thorns
---
* 4 very, very rich new maps that will keep you busy for a while
---
* Decent story
---
* 4 raids
---
* Masteries and elite specifications
---
Living World Season 3 - buy with gems
---
* One new map per episode. Some are a bit small but all are fairly populated and they all have decent enough meta events. 
---
* Decently fun story. 
---
* Easy to obtain ascended gear.
---
Path of Fire
---
* Five? New maps. Metas aren't quite as good at HoT but have been improved over time a bit. Plenty to do. 
---
* New elite specs...
---
* MOUNTS which have the best implementation in any MMO I've played. 
---
* Bounty hunting, collections, achievements etc
---
* 3 raids
---
Living World Season 4
---
* Six new maps, two new mounts, very busy maps at the moment due to well-crafted meta events and lots of reward
---
* All the achievements you could ever want.
---
* 2 new mounts.
---
Nah not at all, anets channel is one of the most filtered by word channel there is. It really kills the spectatorship, instead of allowing certain words ajd having mods ban people when they are misused they instead choose to ouright block you from even sending those words
---
Dungeon's lack the level scaling that fractals have (which is also part of what makes modern WoW dungeons popular - multiple difficulties and mechanics like instabilities in higher levels). I think the area where fractals fall down is only the highest difficult matters. No-one wants to run T1, T2 or even T3 fractals, whereas all levels of WoW dungeons see consistent play. There is something worth getting from even normal mode dungeons in WoW, but the same time spent in GW2's low level fractals is seen as wasted by players.
---
It's also the difficulty of designing a progression system in a game which has account based progression and no gear treadmill. In WoW you will do normal dungeons to acquire ilvl gear to do the next level, you will repeat this for every level and every character (because progression is character based and temporary until the ilvl cap is raised). In GW2 progression is permanent - ascended is king, once you got it you're done. You're also discouraged from playing alts in fractals (unlike dungeons) because without full ascended an alt can't do T4's, but you only get rewarded for doing dailies once, so you will do them on someone already geared (otherwise doing a lower tier without agony requirements will lose you money for a similar time investment - often longer due to only inexperienced people running low level fractals).
---
All up, I agree that dungeons should have continued to be supported, but the ideal situation for dungeons in 2019 would likely have ended up looking a lot like fractals anyway (level scaling, instabilities etc), although I think the years of warping fractals from its original implementation through to today has created a mismatch of mechanics and progression which don't best serve to make the content accessible in the way it ideally should be for its role. WoW has managed to do this better because they reinvented their dungeons until they found a model that worked, rather than building on a foundation (agony resist and ascended gear requirements) that was flawed from the beginning.
---
Sorry didn't mean to offend you. I've just had one too many conversations on reddit that went nowhere and it looked like the start of another one.
---
Personally I haven't been big on the classic hype before, and I'm not really into private servers anymore so I may not be the best person to explain in detail why classic isn't just about nostalgia.
---
The fact is that 15 years after WoW's release there are still a bunch of private servers that have healthy populations from what I've heard, and one of them (Nostalrius) was so successful that not Blizzard had to shut it down, it was the point where they considered making Classic. People genuinely enjoy playing that version of the game in the current age.
---
I wasn't particularly interested (I know how unpolished classic is) but I have a few spare gametime tokens left on retail, so when the stress test rolled around and all I needed was a sub I gave it a go. Totally blew me away. It's grindy, it's difficult to solo, it's slow, you start off broke, but these somehow make the experience all that much meaningful. 
---
Really ended up enjoying my time there and now I'm looking forward to its release in less than 2 days. I'm not going to be hardcore and I'm not sure how long I'll last, but I see potential in it.
---
Modern MMOs are too themepark-y, classic still feels like a world. It's flawed, sure, but it has its own charm. And even if I won't be playing it nonstop, I'm already hyped for a potential TBC release. I loved the gameplay of that era and doing arenas would keep me busy for ages. Modern MMOs have become too spammy and braindead, GW1 and TBC/WotLK had waaaaay better PvP.
---
Does it remind you of your initial comment? I'm kind of fed up with being "nice" to people that are "needlessly rude."  I hadn't noticed ^/s
---
Hi just came to correct that Dry top and Silverwastes are apart of season 2!
---
How can they stop, when you care so much &lt;3
---
OK now this is a tough one...
---
REEEE
---
&gt; By your definition only the hardcore group of any activity would watch said activity.
---
Yeah, no, you are completely wrong. I never even said that, but okay. 
---
&gt; Just going back to my experience with friends and family watching sports on the tv
---
Very good example. An now tell me, when you watch sport on tv with you family and you hear that a popular football player stops, how much does this affect you and your family from watching sport? 
---
What to you *loose* because of it? How does it affect you, your family and your friends at your/their own sport? 
---
Just a guess, but I think the answer is "nothing", right?
---
kijkers xD
---
Community events have usually higher attendance than official events in almost every single non e-sport game content.
---
&gt; Unsupported for a buggy hack that brings really nothing to the viewing experience.
---
You're joking, right?
---
You're actually an insane person. I know how it's making me look to just end it here but there is no good reason for me to argue with an insane person. I hope you read again your posts as you seem to have forgotten what you said in the first place.
---
If you don't like it, just leave :^)
---
You are so delusional, next thing you would say that PoF was actually "content rich expansion".
---
there wont be much more threads related to teapot
---
I mean, i like my guild, i give them it because i don't use tomes nor do i need them, since all my character slots are full now. They been good for me, so its only fair that i should be good to them.
---
to be fair Gold farm were so efficent and broken that they nerfed it
---
Istans 20g/h was broken got nerfed  
---
Aquatic farm was up to 90g/h and got nerfed as well  
---
molten Boss farm was like 40g/h and got nerfed as well
---
also at some point gold fartm was so efficent and broken that they had to add a gold sink just to take money out of the game cause the inflation was absurd
---
TLDR:  
---
No Money Farm defenitly does not need a Buff
---
&gt; that doesn't sound neutral or objective
---
Yeah, I knew some people wouldn't see this, that's why I mentioned it. 
---
&gt; we could say his event brought discussion, drama, entertainment for few thousand ppl. even mere existence of this thread and your comment confirms it.
---
I agree that his event did that, but as soon as it's over, would you really say that you "lost" something? I mean it's like saying you lost something, when you finished watching a movie.
---
Yep, please bring back the first time world completion posts again
---
I haven't played in months and I am sitting here trying to figure out how Erotic Role Play is driving up twitch viewers.
---
You can be good for them under any "guild name" esp. you can change it
---
Thanks, i'll keep that in mind!
---
no, I just think character says more about a person than its race is all.
---
&gt; t’s just very weird to me that people would call it quits literally 5 days before an announcement that may be as big as HoT. 
---
HoT was ridiculously small. And all the marketing related to season 5 conference is about STORY, fucking 2h content drop, with such magnificent gameplay mechanics as listening to dialogues and pressing F.
---
Anet already tried fooling their customers in 2013, saying that living world can be same as expansion. They failed. Now they are trying to repeast that mantra, because they have nothing, to put into the expansion, so they gonna pretend it's all going as planned.
---
HoT hugely boosted 5 man PvE via Fractals. They became so much more popular with the rework. Dungeons were shit anyway, and the ones that were present during LS1 were badly received anyway. Raids were just fucked because of ANets release schedule, not the difficulties. WvW, PvP were in a worse state before HoT. PvP was cele Ele, WvW was burnout due to tournaments. It was an enormous step forwards.
---
&gt;The only thing they needed to do was release new zones, dungeons, and skills now and then. That's all of it.
---
Enormous disagree. A few new skills would never have saved the stale pre-HoT gameplay. New zones with the same shit design as core would never have saved the game. And especially new dungeons, with their countless design flaws, would not be a good form of 5 man PvE. The only dungeons that were still often being done pre nerf were the faceroll farm paths, and actual hard paths like Aetherpath were so badly received that ANet knew their interpretation of dungeons were not the solution for replayable 5 man.
---
I think our crystal balls aren't synchronized, cause I can't see that in mine. But I believe you, you are a pillar of the community and the friendliest of them all :)
---
How dare people share a positive experience or achievement (kinda like those annoying assholes who post about being the first person in their family to graduate from college). Instead lets shit on ArenaNet and spitefully celebrate the success of a community event because it has become a pseudo culture war within the GW2 community over who the fuck knows anymore, but at least we have anger and bitterness right?
---
Soooo much better than a community celebrating and empathising with shared experiences and accomplishments.
---
&gt; and having the non-official hardcore-focused ones still be 10+ times higher kinda shows that this is a huge deal.
---
All it shows is exactly what it would evidently show - that the main GW2 playerbase doesn't care about twitch either way, and that the only ones who care about twitch don't care about ANet's content, and that the *only* thing that they would care about is if ANet started producing specific marginal content which caters to *them*.
---
So: only raiders watch GW2 on twitch. Man, what a surprise.
---
Just why?
---
thats because you dont have any balls at all
---
&gt; it's gonna cannibalize us (and the other MMOs)
---
For a few months. Then most people will remember they have lives, partners, kids, jobs and hygiene standards to keep up. Just like a new MMO launch is a temporary sugar rush, WoW classic will be the same. A huge initial hit, a big drop off (even Blizzard are anticipating this) before it stablises with a small but hardcore audience (because it's WoW, it will still be pretty decent, especially when it's paired with retail subs so many people will play both).
---
If you were fine before classic launches, you will be fine after it launches. Personally I think GW2 is OK but S5 will have to surpass all others for the game to recover what it's lost in the last two years imo, either that or be short and explicitly lead into an expansion next year.
---
That'll do.
---
If it helps, it was a coincidence that I posted it after you said that.
---
I suddenly want to join an RP guild, this is so pretty.
---
but there were no traits listed. also basic zerker necro would survive a lot, while making all the damaooge, and you could even go healin'/rezin' necro and keep most of your oomf there.
---
What do you want? It's the biggest event this game will have for a long time, if ever again.
---
God damit..they did not sponsore ERP openly because Teapot used a hack in order to get a free camera to broadcast the even
---
You're so so so so wrong. There are so many whales within the hardcore community. So many of them. Shit 2 of them are the ones commentating and organizing the ERP LOL Teapot and Roy are whales, they have spent a load of money in this game. That's just 2 names. There are so many more of them that are spending a lot of real money in the game.
---
&gt;  i lose out on a tourney i very much enjoy watching.
---
So you loose nothing until next year (was an annual event, right?), right?
---
&gt;Still, you'd agree having HoT release 18 months after release would have helped more than releasing 36 months instead, specially with how tiny it was.
---
Of course. I just hard disagree that without the features HoT brought, the game would have survived. Elite Specs, Fractal rework, actually good open world, non-temporary content and Raids have all been fantastic introductions that to this day are all important parts of the game.
---
&gt;Also, it didn't have unique rewards, only a few RNG-only weapon reskins. 
---
That were worth quite a lot. Kinda weird that people still play open world for rare expensive drops when the droprates are so much worse, and don't want to play a new dungeon path with a much higher chance to actually give money (although it is RNG).
---
I also disagree with Aetherpath being good, but that's more due the personal issues I have with the design issues dungeons in general have. It was a step in the right direction, but not good. 99CM and 100CM were actually great 5 man content, but they stopped making good 5 man content altogether after them.
---
I watched my neighbor play a bunch of the original guild wars, I thought it was super interesting. 
---
Then I finally had a PC and gw2 was coming out when I was older and I was so excited to do gvg. 
---
Oh boy that was a surprise.
---
As it should. It better also deliver though, or those numbers won't mean anything anyway.
---
but raiding comm was (is?) \~5% of playerbase ...
---
It’s insane how many people correlate twitch views to game life.
---
so you paid around 50 cents per view, not sure if that is a good rate
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/dont-miss-our-special-announcement-event/
---
&gt;Don’t forget—there’s a special announcement event less than two weeks away on August 30 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time (UTC-7)! Join us in person at the Moore Theatre in Seattle before PAX West opens, or catch the whole stream on our official Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook channels. The countdown will begin after our anniversary livestream.
---
&gt;The doors to the Moore Theatre will open at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time (UTC-7). There will be security on site. 
---
Have fun!
---
&gt; ~~You're actually an insane person. I know how it's making me look to just end it here but there is no good reason for me to argue with an insane person. I hope you read again your posts as you seem to have forgotten what you said in the first place.~~
---
You mean: 
---
"I have no more agruments, so I call you insane and don't want to continue this conversation" 
---
Typical behavior when a discussion requires too much effort. I don't blame you, but you it's easier to say "I don't want to continue this conversation". Or simply stop to answer. ;)
---
No, i had no such experience, i started Norn who went to Ascalon to level with his buddy Sylvary ele, who later (couple of hours after) left the game. Forever. Not sure where i went from there, several stories and races from that... i still have not done pof for 2nd time, and my hot last boss achive is not achieved yet.
---
&gt; after 7 years, people might want to try other things
---
It's not that. The game is still fun, most people who quit would gladly play more, we're just tired of Anet's mismanagement of an otherwise brilliant game. Many veterans have reached the end of their rope. It's not about taking a break for 2 months or whatever. They either floor us on the 30th or a mass exodus is about to happen.
---
Do you like fancy tea?
---
There were two threads a few weeks back that show that this is **not** true
---
Yeah this isnt your game .
---
Funny how you say that, most things they do in-game can be called grandpa-proof at best. Oh don't mash keys too hard or this might break! Oh don't use this skill there or the world ends! This is ArenaNet.
---
So... turn it into WoW lol
---
&gt;At what point? (serious question)
---
at a lot of points in your original comment.
---
"Since it has no impact to the playerbase" - impacts some players so it has some impact. you used your feelings to make this statement.
---
"except for the 0,01% hardcore raiders, so it's losing nothing" - that's still a lot of people, you're erasing them with your statement and dimissing them as if they don't count. that's another example of you using your feelings.
---
and that's just first paragraph, i'm not gonna copypaste and explain almost every sentence you wrote to prove you're not being neutral. you already come off as person who can't be argued with or convinced.
---
try to go even higher for this big BIG final boizzz and gurlzzz
---
Thanks for sharing. Fashion wars is the only relevant content for gw2. Keep up the good work, keep the money flowing.
---
/s
---
Yes but they do want people to follow PAX rules if you read the blog "cosplayers must follow PAX cosplay rules" so perhaps this is a joint adventure and although Anet is doing it at their own time its an hour before PAX begins maybe Anet could kick of PAX kind of like EA with E3.
---
I'm not a raider. I'm watching THE HELL out of this event to support the hardcore community.
---
I think it is a mistake to judge a game by the viewership. Sometimes games do poorly on twitch because the audience is playing the game, not watching it.
---
&gt; I don't think you know what that expression means.
---
How ironic.
---
Truthfully, WvW is hurting significantly, and with the announcement around the corner you’re better off waiting to see what will be unveiled on the 30th. Just my opinion, though.
---
58:11:2:1064:101 that’s the one i’m getting
---
That's what I thought too, and was confused as to what this was all about
---
I'm sure teapot that bought 25 accounts for login rewards isn't a source of income, just like the exposure of the game he's giving to 12k people right now.
---
Better add another gemstore skin and a living story episode in a map that gets empty after a week.
---
Heart of Thorns sure did though. Pepperidge Farms remembers.
---
i’ll try it out, thank you!
---
It's interesting.  GW1 was a "Competitive online role playing game," CoRPG vs. an MMO whereas GW2 has almost fully morphed into an MMORPG: Massive Multiplayer Online *Role Playing* game.  It feels as if GW2's competitive heritage is being phased out in favor of microtransactions and casual story content; it's not just neglect of high end PvE -- it's neglect of *anything* competitive because of the connotation of what it "means" to ArenaNet for players to be competitive.  It's a bit of an eyesore tbh...
---
god, actually pretty impressive, good found!
---
nope don’t use any network traffic filters, thanks tho.
---
It's an in-house joke for the raiding community.  ArenaNet has a vendetta against anything competitive, and changing the name wouldn't make a difference.
---
Wonder if that name is taken..
---
For me the worldboss runs gave me more lootboxes then the champ run do and you work just as hard for those champs as you do for worldbosses. It takes roughly the same amount of time to kill one, well except for those really simple one that does nothing to you but those are really very few compared to how many there are with multiple action skills towards the players.
---
Holy shit you read in way to much to what i wrote i did not say it was hard to kill them i said it was harder like the bandit with legendary bandit after that. And the fact is that champ trains was there the first few days and now there is some every here and there maybe. So yeah i get more lootboxes with worldbosses then chams
---
IIRC Ultimates and Savages are expressly excluded from Roulettes (at least the ones that most are doing, I *think* there's Expert Roulettes that have them?) because of how high end they are.
---
The rest of your post's spot on though. Different tiers, multiple difficulties for even vanilla content, etc. XIV just does it right.
---
I think it's less about Twitch and more about poor marketing in general. Like right now, we're pretty far from the last x-pack and there's nothing to be excited about. We know there's another LW season coming, but what'll cool about it? Who knows. 
---
Compare that to Warframe's insane space battles coming up. They're so goddamn cool and every WF fan knows their first revision will probably suck, but still! So cool! Generally speaking, the weekly Prime Time stream of Warframe gives you more insight into what's going on with it than GW2's marketing gives in a year.
---
Yes they work towards the ranking system for each game mode. And your xp bar for PvE is kind of hidden whilst in this two game modes.
---
Anyone remember The Eye of Janthir choosing a spectating dev at Deimos? Yeah they definitly can watch.
---
[sT] second Throws
---
We kind of expect that to happen but noone said anything about it but season 5 is comming up anaversiry is running and they have xp events to level up faster and catch up. Kind of feels like this is a good opertunity. Let's hope so :)
---
Neglect facing high-end competitive PvE, PvP &amp; WvW content.
---
Lolololol. Daym right
---
frog with teeth PepeLaugh
---
Having shit burst means it's worthless in any group with decent comp, since burst is literally all you get to do in one. If you're looking to carry random comp groups, sure, you can do that. But... better look for a better group if you ask me.
---
This is just really embarrassing for both of you
---
Because the post was edited and the former post had other text in it which made me draw the conclusion i made. Reading it as it is now then it is very obvious what he really meant and i would not have even answered the post if this what was said first.
---
&gt; so why is it an issue now?
---
Because we gave them 7 years to get their shit together and it's been 1 step forward, 2 steps back all the way through. Enough is enough.
---
&gt; now an issue?
---
These have always been issues. But they got worse, not better.
---
&gt; This also shows that GW2 is capable of pulling decent numbers on twitch if there is hard content and competition.
---
&gt; 
---
yes challenging content played by 3-5% of the community. Now you should understand why Anet does not focus raid content.
---
&gt; instead of trying to pass GW2 off as some glorified antisocial dressup game for furries.
---
Friendliest ga- .... oh fuck it.
---
You made your points, only thing I will respond to is "Some people never understood that GW2 is no hardcore game. I always was a casual friendly and fairly "easy" game."
---
The further GW2 developed the more the devs initially wanted to make endgame content harder. When HoT was released it was terribly hard for the average casual and got extremely bad reviews. Soon after that ANET started downscaling HoT maps and subsequently LWS 3 maps. PoF was the last bit for ANET that "casual only" the the top money strategy. Since then it has all been casual focus.
---
Just the content that the game needs!
---
12.6 PogU
---
\*ArenaNet has left the chat\*
---
900 is optimistic. 
---
300-400 most of the time.
---
We reached 13000 viewers!
---
&gt; People's obsession with meta takes a lot of fun out of the game imo. I get wanting to optimize groups, but I think many people just take it too far.
---
This is the #1 reason why I don't do instanced PvE anymore. All pugs care about is the damage meta, and leave behind 90% of the other game's mechanics in favor of bursting things down asap with high risk/high reward gameplay.
---
Buildcraft is just nonexistent in the PvE meta like it is in Open World and competitive modes.
---
You're the one misrepresenting numbers, but I digress.
---
&gt;Cheers and good luck with your next serious, worthy game.
---
Thanks! I'm most likely just moving away from gaming altogether, unless GW2 suddenly continues catering to me on the 30th. Was fun while it lasted, ended in a spectacular way with the best and most watched GW2 community stream ever.
---
A ton of people are checking twitch to know if a game is still alive or not, including me. 
---
I can give you a ton of games that are bringing to life again because of twitch streamers. it brings fucking visibility to the game.
---
People not understanding that are morons.
---
Yes. Binding Coil in general is excluded from Roulette due to the difficulty.
---
13k is insane. An absolute banger to go out on.
---
Im new to guildwars and everytime i saw ERP hype i was like: " why are they so hyped about erotic roleplaying???". I played wow and if someone mentioned erp in wow it means erotic roleplaying XDD, so yeah LOL.
---
Tell that to FXIV. Lol.....Twitch is a cancer, people not understanding that are morons.
---
Speak for yourself, this has been incredibly entertaining.
---
We over 13k now bois!
---
Unfortunately, calling it that, while we all think its great, will only push Anet further from supporting it - even more than they already were I mean.
---
Good for afk farming with Nightfall on Reaper :^)
---
Do you mean the fight with the canid fighter? Pretty sure the door opens after a puzzle, not automatically.
---
14k now. Love it.
---
feels even weirder now that it hit 14k
---
So again, why 7? Why not when it became an issue, why not when others were calling it out?
---
I am not denying it is an issue. That would be hypocritical of me as someone that has been saying the release of raids is too slow and too little (and lacking variable difficulties) since before HoC released.
---
I am asking to consider why we've had so much drama and negativity now.
---
Be careful with ERP, everywhere else considers it "erotic role-playing"
---
&gt;And it doesn't help that most of the fashion is only available as gem-store items.
---
like the Mist Shard Armor from last episode? Or the weapon set from "All or Nothing"? And don't forget the Elegy Armor Set from "A Star to Guide us"
---
This are only the last 3 episodes. Nothing of these are gem-store items-
---
could you imagine if they banned participants because of that
---
They did not support it because a third party tool being used so sometimes it does not always be what it looks like :)
---
omg stop being part a bitch and just leave the Reddit, its a salty hole anyway.
---
this is the exact reason why they chose the name
---
ERP is the most positive thing the community accomplished by themselves.
---
As someone who'd never heard of "Elitis Raiding Party" I was very confused.
---
It shows even in pug raids. I quit raiding last week as well, just can't take it any more. Reset day pugging was great on EU, up until w6-7 came along. Before you could get pretty much get a full clear done with any group in about 3 hours,faster with decent group. 
---
Now after people mass quit raiding, after the disappointment that is w6-7, it takes minimum 6 hours, if you're lucky. It's a clown fiesta every time, groups that demand 1k+ li, end up with people that don't even know basic mechanics. It's just not worth the time any more, people rage quitting left and right. Then you have to spend forever finding replacements. 
---
You could even do things like 5 man vg in pug groups, for fun. Not any more,since all those people left.
---
So if Arena Net accept this, how do you think it will go when people start to using this or making other tools and Arena Net bans them for using a third party tool they would have accepted. Sometimes you might want to support something but are not able because if it happens it destroy the credebillity of a company. 
---
And you might feel yeh but they do it anyway, maybe so, but they are not putting them self in the position were they break their own rules and then want to ban others for it.
---
15.1k bois
---
Hot is not living story, nor is pof. Season 3 has grindable ascended gear that keeps the map alive, not living story content.
---
That looks to be about the same rate as my key farmer but I am basically using every booster except black lion.
---
Sorry didn’t really follow current event. So this MightyTeapot guy is some kinda famous streamer and he is done playing GW2 or something??
---
Teapot: so I'm making this tournament, tons of free exposure for the game, I'm giving the raid community something to do
---
Anet: oh, that's awesome! Now we can focus on making more gemstore content that the raid folks have something to do, thanks
---
I'm so glad to see you posting here still! Hope you are doing well.

The WoW Mythic Tournament is peaking at 22k views and that's a sponsored blizzard tournament. It has an awesome observer cam, professional commentary, DPS meters, etc etc
---
Imagine if ANet gave as much attention to this as Blizzard does with the mythic tournament? 
---
Missed opportunity? Yep, definitely. 
---
Shame TP and ANet couldn't have come up with some sort of compromise.
---
look at outfit vs new armor.
---
Welcome to the "Now what do I do" club!
---
&gt;ArenaNet didn't coin "Fashion Wars 2."
---
I'm going to disagree here. Yes, they did. True, the majority of the community adopted this "playstyle" but the thing that made it possible is ANet focusing so heavily on cosmetics in order to drive microtransaction sales.
---
Don't get me wrong, I totally get it - the game needs to make serious money to keep the development process going. It's a necessary evil. But I don't like how far are they taking it. Stuff like kites and chairs for instance. Useless junk that actively inhibits the use of the game's core gameplay? Pfft...
---
Is it coincidence that on the front page a thread has gone on a tangent about lalafell emotes and the other ERP?
---
i can't belive this fucking troll got over 900 upvotes what the fuck is wrong with people
---
We still have dhuum, which might make it.
---
Sure it's getting old, just like the two hours of unrepeatable content which is just a straight fact
---
no one seems to care about all the viewbots
---
Well, guess I am going to bite.
---
&gt; updates that provide short-term band-aids rather than long-term solutions designed to encourage player retention and longevity. 
---
Want to explain how a camera hack would do this, as opposed to something such as variable raid difficulties?Say, an easy mode so people don't just farm the same bosses and over. Maybe repeatable CMs too? The same sort of things that the hardcore "community" have shouted down for years whenever it is suggested because they don't want their game mode shared with players that are perceived as less skilled?
---
It sure has been a joy seeing streamers complain about the state of the game in the past couple of months when they've done pretty much nothing to promote the actual changes that are needed to breathe new life into their preferred modes while aiding retention. Some of us have been requesting this for years. Us with our VitVs and CoZs and EoAEs that have been shouted down as just wanting an easier mode to play by the same people that are now bemoaning the "death" of their game modes (that have been receiving the same pace of release for the past three years...).
---
\#20 now
---
I don't really know if you were trying to be funny or salty
---
Why would you expect that stream to get more? It is occurring on a Friday, when many players within Europe and the US are going to be at work...
---
I'll definitely be interested, but it will be surreptitious refreshing of reddit while I am working, not following the stream itself.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
---
Pogu
---
sT is insane
---
Same question. Played since beta, never heard of this guy and have no idea why he's suddenly so important.
---
But they just wanna tell stories
---
&gt; Semi procedural content is something I'm not a fan of, for the same reasons as fractal instabilities.
---
I'm talking things like having some paths be blocked, so you have to walk around, and bosses spawning in random locations, so you crash into them by surprise, or have to scout the dungeon if you want the kill, kinda like the troll in Ascalonian Catacombs.
---
One of the major advantages of this is that the dungeon doesn't always feel the same. You can make it even more interesting by adding rooms that don't always open, secret bosses, etc.
---
Instabilities are pure cancer, so no discussion there. I haven't played fractals since the last ones were introduced (one jade now and then when it's daily and that's it).
---
&gt;A huge raidwing ala GW1 elite area could definitely work. Or even 5 man content, but that might be a bit too restricting composition wise. The 'joy of exploring' to me isn't really important in instanced content. An optimized route will be found really quickly anyway, and it usually means that it's just areas filled with trash. However trash is implemented, it'll never be interesting to me. An encounter is either a boss or miniboss or it is an uninteresting mob pack. Exploring instances after they're clear is really cool though.
---
Trash can be interesting. Group of enemies that require a strategy and not just stacking would be a welcome addition, specially with how good they often were in GW1.
---
&gt;Deepstone puzzles aren't too bad IMO, I actually like them. It's just that they don't feel like they fit the fractal too well, and I really dislike the timegate. It feels like it could be a great CM boss fractal with only a slight rework. Especially the last fight could be extremely fun and a true DPS race with disappearing floor.
---
The two first bosses should have been integrated into their puzzles, imo. Ideally, Deepstone should be a total of 4 encounters, like this:
---
* Air elemental miniboss + DDR puzzle in the fight area.
---
* Spider miniboss + wind puzzle in fight area.
---
* Minotaur boss (a real boss).
---
* The Voice boss + the maze puzzle.
---
And just remove the elevator section altogether.
---
Tengu, largos, and stone dwarves go first!
---
It is during work hours, but I believe HoT or PoF was as well? Those still pulled hundreds of thousands of views overall. Interest in huge announcements absolutely shows player engagement.
---
The game would've been much more popular if ANet really focused on getting more people to play. It's really enjoyable but the game feels dead
---
This tournament should show very clearly that ArenaNET doesn't care about supporting the community. It's time to move on from Guild Wars 2. ArenaNET only cares how much you are spending in the gem store.
---
&gt; DPS meters
---
&gt; yes that is what GW2 definitely need
---
Already has it and it's absolutely amazing tool if you care even a little bit about improving your gameplay. Also less toxic than judging players by AP like we used to have ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
ANet (more accurately their marketing team) simply does not know, nor understand how social media platforms works.
---
They are also far too afraid of displeasing ultra casuals, because they know those people are far greater of a threat to the company than hardcore casuals...because those ultra casuals are the ones that are the loudest, and would go the extra step to tarnish their company's name if they are displeased.
---
&gt;It is during work hours, but I believe HoT or PoF was as well? Those still pulled hundreds of thousands of views overall. Interest in huge announcements absolutely shows player engagement.
---
Which would be a, reasonably, fair comparison.
---
However, that isn't what you are doing. [You are comparing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cvb9yr/for_a_long_time_gw2_reached_12k_viewers_on_twitch/ey3e7wt/) it to a stream that has been run over a weekend, a holiday weekend in some parts of the world, and has been relentlessly promoted on social media, in-game with people spamming LFGs and on this subreddit, despite it not clearly abiding by the sub rules to do so.
---
If you want to make a valid point, make your comparisons and statements valid.
---
I bet anet has listened to these people drown out everyone else on reddit for years and completely missed the potential market of raiding, hard content. As proven by this event.
---
Its just LS tho. I remember early 2015 when HoT was announced the hype was REAL
---
Aw man I remember running thematic dungeon runs and one of the themes was ''REAPER ONLY - VALKYRIE OF THE WURM''
---
It was so fun and so easy.
---
Another was a Ranger Valkyrie of the Wurm run with survival skills and massive GS bursts
---
I miss thematic runs
---
&gt; with 0 support from arenanet
---
well, they provided the game
---
&gt;ERP had to turn down support from Anet because Anet wouldn't support a camera software that actually makes the event watchable?
---
Anet won't support it because it's made outside of the company.
---
Pretty sure there is some legal shit involved here.
---
I'm pretty sure the XIV fanbase would have a collective month-long orgasm if Square adopted the system that Arenanet uses for dyes and glamours.
---
Remember how bad it was before wardrobes where you had to keep dyes in inventory and buy each time you wanted to change colors?
---
Yeah, *that* fucking nightmare.
---
Glamours are almost as bad, they level lock the appearances themselves as opposed to GW2 just needing you to consume the item.
---
And don't get me started on how much better consolidated the GW2 main story is vs the literally 600+ quests of the XIV one. 
---
There's a graveyard full of people who just said "Fuck it!" after hitting the 2.x series. For those who aren't aware, Square has divided up the XIV story into patch series:
---
2.0 = A Realm Reborn (base game)
---
2.x = Post-ARR aka Seventh Astral Era (where people are usually made or broken from the sheer amount of quests, mostly fetch)
---
3.0 = Heavensward
---
3.x = Dragonsong War
---
4.0 = Stormblood
---
4.x = The Legend Returns (Ivalice Arc)
---
5.0 = Shadowbringers (Current latest expansion)
---
5.x = No name known yet afaik as it hasn't officially hit 5.1 yet.
---
Coming from GW2 which has fixed a *lot* of these problems years ago is jarring. But Square's said to be looking at addressing the MSQ issue at least during Shadowbringers patches, last I heard.
---
meanwhile, refugees in kourna have flashbacks of mad people running in their fields burning everything to the ground
---
No you aren't. Here is exactly what you wrote. Which I linked in my previous post:
---
"If the official LS reveal doesn't get many, MANY times the views this has it'd be absolutely pathetic. If this is supposedly only the 'very niche raiding community' watching and the LS doesn't blow it out of the water ANet has seriously done something wrong."
---
See the bit that says "MANY times the viewers this has"? That's you comparing it with this event stream that has occurred under entirely different conditions.
---
Discussing things with elements of the Twitch-aligned portion of the Guild Wars 2 community is seriously frustrating. Ignore what people are saying, denying direct things that you've stated and keep changing the narrative to fit whatever you feel benefits you.
---
Exactly a reaction like this is why things are looking so bad for GW2 right now. Not that it's an unwarranted reaction by any means, it's that people are just not interested in LS5 while it's supposed to be something on an expansion scale with expansion features.
---
There's no hype for it. There was a ton of hype for HoT, then less for PoF, now even less for LS5.
---
not only healers are useless in fractals but wanting to bring scrapper is even worse, go renegade if u wanna heal.
---
harrier btw if you really want to
---
Indeed, I'm aware. It's also entirely unrelated to OP's question.
---
Wait till FFXIV gets ultimate raisins few weeks then compare views.
---
can't wait this if over and all you elitism players are gone and GW2 will become the great game it was couple years ago.
---
Honestly, because WoW has a subscription
---
I don't see the problem? Valve don't support non valve events? What are you expecting lmao
---
He's probably talking about the camera mod they're using (which is adding a lot to the viewing experience, but it's not 'endorsed' in any way like arcdps)
---
I hope you get this @_@
---
I really love the original gradient, but is there any way to get it on a black background? I tried just doing it myself but it gets all choppy one way and the gradient looks weird a different way .n.
---
if you assume high dps is improving one's gameplay, yes
---
but that's just you - assuming
---
When FC havoc squads can literally Hug the backend of a BG zerg and lose nobody , There's Something up. Zergs aren't that brainless, nor that single-minded.
---
I'd definitely appreciate that and I think it is definitely something that Anet can be legimately criticised for. Many companies and charities will run events to promote what they are doing, including things that mandate weekend working.
---
Having the stream at the weekend would likely be preferable for the majority of viewers and unlikely to be a major onus on a high proportion of the workforce.
---
I know he is talking about that, the mod doesn't break the tos in any way tho
---
He might get more views in wow classic than gw2.
---
&gt; much more popular
---
and would lag more
---
"Sure", you got the legendary weapon, story, achievements, map completion etc done in two hours. Like everyone that tells the same shit over and over, you either consciously lie, are clueless or don't even play the game. And if you actually do play it, you may as well leave if you don't like the state of the game, it doesn't need you.
---
I wouldn’t say the main story campaign in GW2 is strictly better than FFXIV’s MSQ. Gameplay and design wise? Yes. Writing-wise? Not even close. Heavensward and Shadowbringers blows anything GW2 has writing-wise out of the water.
---
That being said, there’s a lot GW does better: zone design, exploration, leveling, visual design, mounts, PvP.
---
Leveling and questing in FFXIV is honestly awful (even WoW is more fun when it comes to side questing).
---
But FFXIV does plenty of things better as well: writing and story, difficult content, fashion wars, variety of content, crafting, etc.
---
I definitely agree with you that the two could learn from each other!
---
I'm not twitch-aligned, I don't even have an account. I just watch big GW2 events.
---
It's not changing stuff to fit the narrative. It's that people don't even seem to be interested in the future of the game. They need to justify an official announcement that has been constantly announced for more than a month and supposed to be expansion level being smaller than a community ran stream that's supposed to be 'for the niche hardcore community only'. It's not even proven smaller yet, and people are already making excuses for it even though previous comparable announcement streams have been 10 times as big as this community stream.
---
It'll really look bad if it's smaller. That means that there's more than 10 times less than the PoF announcement that was also on a friday at similar times.
---
It's not that it's not watchable it's the fact that there is nothing to watch. The big WvW streamers are gone, big pvp streamers are gone and the top tier pve streamers do all their dailies in a few hours and standing around in the aerodrome is not food viewing.
---
Are there any other companies that acknowledge when a stream by a community member gets 17k viewers?
---
The legendary weapons which have been looking worse than cash shop items, the story which has been degrading for a while now, map completion which is done in 10 minutes and "achievements" that are just boring
---
Keep going, I saw nearly 17k.
---
why the long face?
---
Wait, you guys are getting paid???
---
The guy that got dhuumed was a Player known under the name "Wut" and they banned his account (for 24h or 3 days?) cause he flamed someone before the mat started. 10/10 timing
---
And none of that notes that you are actually comparing this event stream to the announcement. Something you do, again, at the end of your comment, while denying previously that you did.
---
Might want to consider a bit of consistency.
---
Wtf are you trying to say
---
WvW also has a ton of potential, but they never invested their time in the format beyond superficial addons and new maps.
---
I quit after HoT while keeping tabs on the game still, and nothing compels me to check it out again.
---
When it’s 20x what you normally see yes. The answer to your question is yes.
---
Yea except Anet hates effective marketing.
---
If thats the reason im even more dissapointed
---
it's most commonly called DPS meter but it has more utility than just that.
---
DPS Meter (obviously), broken down into skill usage and rotation
---
Raid mechanics with logs that you can use for replay
---
Healing done
---
Boon uptime
---
It has all stats you could possibly want to improve at every role there is.
---
Same, just unlocked it too. Fell asleep around 5 times due to the collections being that sleep aid boring, but it's pretty nice I guess
---
&gt; It was also not uncommon practice to hide some content objects in the air, since at launch players couldn't have ever gotten this high.
---
[orly?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLZzuThS1i4)
---
Haha this one is in Arah and you could get to it around launch but people only started to learn about it in 2014. Either way I love these raptors they're hilarious.
---
you should be quiet. you are on a holy crusade too.
---
The door that's near the start of the quest is where the game crashes for me, the one that won't open is later on but I've never gotten past the part where it crashes
---
Balance is key, both hardcore and casual bring different things to the game.  
---
Although Anet makes a few fouls trying to pick one to please.  
---
Both bring money, anet should try to balance both, not easy.  
---
But not just the loud minority.  
---
That loud minority, although fickle brings in players, both hardcore and casual.  
---
Those casuals brought in by hardcore voices,  pay salaries and bills to keep servers going.
---
&gt;I've played only 30min to an hour for the past week and i feel like i make double the money i usually make from gold farming by just doing a daily pvp match qnd then my daily crafts and some fractal (or mat gavering depending on time i have) compared to when i farm silverwastes.
---
The gold farms like SW and others need other steps to turn those items farmed into gold or crafted into items you use for yourself. So the gold you see come in is in item form vs the daily stuff you are doing alot of it comes in gold form. Gold farms are better than the daily routines because you can do them more than once per day and  for some faster and for many with less effort than say doing T4 fractals and cms.
---
I'm going to hop on this thread. I've bought and opened one box, but after the community goal was "fixed". I'm not getting the achievement rewards. Could it be that they're only being awarded to those who contributed before the bar was filled.
---
Yes.  If they defaulted to larger guild hall limits, the server usage doesn't care if people are actually in it, a single person in a 25 limit guild hall uses the same resources as 25 people in a 25 limit hall.  If every guild hall everywhere were automatically set at 25 (or higher) even for just one person in it would cause extreme server strain.
---
possibly, exactly like that, it does not spread to everyone playing gw2
---
alright, I shared some of mine, where's your source?
---
They have only ever talked about LV5, that's it.
---
Same thing with the people against gearchecking. It's because they're the only people for who the tool can work out negatively. Gearcheck and DPS meters only impact those that lie about either in the first place.
---
Lucky Noobs!
---
[X] Doubt
---
Okay, so just keep changing your argument, just as I said you would.
---
Have a fun evening!
---
It was over 16k today.
---
Working as intended. You're likely closing in on, or are already at a rating appropriate for your skill level. You are doing "less well" in the victory matches and the opponents likely have lower ratings than you. Therefore, you take a bigger hit for a loss.
---
Legendary Guilds facing off!! The viewers win no matter what :)
---
^^^^LN ^^^^lets ^^^^go
---
No one cares what you think.
---
Teapot prefered quality over some extra gems and a retweet, and it paid the hell off.
---
I'm just giving additional arguments since you seem to be ignoring half anyway, but yeah we're done here!
---
I actually like art posts and I'm not angry about Anet at all, just disappointed. I don't see a reason for anyone to flame artists, but I don't understand the need to post unnecessary phone pics of irrelevant and unimpressive "achievements" (aka map completion and legy crafting) since they bring 0 discussion value.
---
Imagine every raider posting how they got 250 LI or how someone unlocked a golden fractal weapon skin every time it happened. Then you'd see how ridiculous some people actually look like.
---
???? The showmatch with anet never happened
---
But but but I keep being told GW2 can never be popular on twitch............
---
Qadim wins!
---
Stared at the slots for a while. Figured I probably have enough - 3 armor classes per race is enough for me, I think.
---
Then I blew the money on BL keys. Oops.
---
Rooting for \[sT\]!
---
Same but I just want to see what might be our last ERP.
---
It's intensely close. I'm not rooting for either one in particular. Either way EU wins so EU &gt; NA. :^)
---
Was thinking of playing is it worth playing?
---
Anybody can explain (briefly) how they are able to move the camera the way they are ? Completely free.
---
Is this the 10th player ? Is he a camera-dead-man ? Does it mean they played the whole event with only 9 players team ?! 
---
That's impressive.
---
You're saltier than me though. Imagine being so pathetic that you have to type all that, really shows what gw2 community is all about.
---
Let me just quote you because I know you'll delete it once you notice your precious internet points dropping.
---
&gt; ahahahaha, no. you hardcore players think you have the upper hand for once and still nobody cares about you when you are gone and thats to much for your inflated egos.
---
&gt; #saltybois
---
11 million accounts is very realistic, infact it's very little for a game with a f2p core game. WoW is 100m+ afaik
---
You lost me at zerging = money lol
---
You miss the whole point of wvw, which is massive large scale combat.
---
Roaming is not kill fodder if you are a good roamer. 
---
Havoc is essential for disruptions/diversions/distractions.
---
Zerging is zerging but it's not about loot. That's a simple by product to fighting.
---
Warframe is not in a good place my friend. While I could see you getting hyped for Empyrean, it has been delayed to hell and back having missed out on its winter 2018 and summer 2019 release deadlines, as well as having the dubious honor of being the first update not to be released within its tennocon reveal year. Many veterans have left such as Iflynn and LifeOfRio due to the lack of content and undeveloped endgame, just like GW2.
---
gw2 was big at some point?
---
Yip, we are. We were done the first time you ignored your own post to try and spin things but it has been fun seeing you twirl in circles and forget about the previous points you made.
---
Next time, if you actually want to make a sincere point, don't contradict yourself at every turn just because you want to doomsay. I understand that it is the cool thing at the moment, that's fine. Just be more consistent.
---
inb4 "Removed: Low effort content. \#Love4ArenaNet"
---
I think so too, so I trigger you #saltybois
---
&gt;Yip, we are.
---
Continues to go on still making no point. o/
---
It is a matter of stance. But I digress. If you want to go beside the point and focus on unimportant aspects that badly, that's fine. I'm definitely out now, since you seem to continue to respond.
---
I hate this mentality, even if other companies don't, why can't Anet do it? 
---
Anet in many ways has been the breakthrough in the industry, no sub fee, no stupid grind, no stupid gear grind, why can't they make a breakthrough as well by supporting these events? Especially when these events massively outperform anything they do .. its just insane ..
---
Anet could have free marketing, big brain move, if it supported more its content creators.
---
17k peak
---
No Anet support

---
Let us know what a camera deattachment breaks in this rule.
---
Okay! Enjoy being definitely out.
---
The only stance issue is that you can't find the one you want to stick with, and when someone proposes an idea to you that you find agreeable, you pivot on it. Maybe you just don't like accepting the idea of changing your mind unless someone else is shown to be wrong.
---
That's okay. Just keep it in mind if you want to try and discuss fair comparisons and such in the future.
---
O_o
---
It's kinda depressing that being a "friendly" game/community is a common sales tactic to make players feel safe so they spend money...
---
Me and my friends lost our minds at how cool Lion's Arch was. We immediately started exploring. The minor detail that really caught our affection was the water droplets on the screen when you surface from being underwater.
---
During the betas, a friend and I were desperately scouring the areas around us to find some pathway between Black Citadel and Wayfarer's Foothills. We had no idea we'd have to trek to the north. The world felt so massive back then, even with only a few maps being known to us at the time.
---
I was like "damn what have I missed with gw2?"
---
I absolutely agree that they wanted to make endgame harder. However compared to other games even the harder raid bosses like Dhuum aren't hardcore.
---
Except this isn't true. This is the point of view that you have, maybe, but it's really really not true. I'm in those zones all the time. There ar people calling out quests in Kessex, even when an event isn't on. There are people asking for help. There are people offering help.
---
To be sure, leveling in most games is a mostly solo experience, to the point where everyone is on different quests. So this is just another attempt by you to push people away from a game that is exactly made for the type of people who enjoy that sort of content.
---
To be sure hearts are solo content, but there are plenty of dynamic events that require greater numbers that people show up to in greater numbers.
---
This complete and utter illusion that because things don't require communication that no one is actually going to help out, or join in, or run by and jump up and down after his hogwash.  Again the solo experience comment is easily misintepreted. This is like an anti ad by a guy who's not happy with the game.
---
Again the guy asked if there were people in lower zones while he was leveling and you know, there are.
---
I've played Lotro, WoW, Rift, TSW, a bit of BDO, ESO and in not one of those games did I find a different experience in low level zones.
---
The difference in this game is that anyone can jump into an event, no matter what level they are, without worrying if they have the quest. This game is MORE social than most games when it comes to it, because in most games you can't repeat most quests. Which means that you can get help in those dynamic events and often do.
---
The quest hub system in most games is truly solo. Most recently I tried ESO and in low level zones I felt like it was absolutely a solo game, much more than this game. And in FF XIV, I asked for a help a few times and didn't get it. Same with BDO.
---
Saying something doesn't make it true. 
---
So what you're saying is it's bad for hard core people but it's also a solo game for causals. That means casuals can't join in a group of people playing and have a good time, and that's is what I'm talking about exactly. If you want to talk for the hard core people, you should probably avoid talking for the casuals. You don't understand what makes us tick.
---
&gt; Holy shit you read in way to much to what i wrote
---
Huh, maybe I did.
---
Ben P who is 50% of the WvW/PvP team.
---
Yeah! It's very helpful for precision jumps :) any skill with an aoe indicator will do the same, such as scepter 2 on guard or placing a banner on warrior
---
Good reply.
---
Also, the wiki is handy too.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page
---
Yes, it's just a joke.
---
Oh that makes more sense now. Thanks!
---
It was fun. I was hoping LN would clutch Wing 6 and they blew it, luckily sT lost it at wing 7 and LN took advantage.
---
Good games.
---
This event marks the beginning of the transition era that will start this August 30th, depending on the announcement.
---
Either Anet announces something that will change the way the game is going for good, or they announce something that will hype, but keep on the current trend until the end of the game becomes a self-fulfilled prophecy.
---
SUCH a good ending!!!!
---
Sea of Sorrows has good OCX presence, but as others have said, you may want to wait until around the 30th—relinks are coming, and there **may** be some more info on the progress of the “Alliances” update as well.
---
I happen to think ERP 2 was better, definitely not biased though.
---
Yes! Witnessing the final race, ST tailing off and LN taking the win by 6 seconds. We couldn't have wished for a better ERP ending. Epic right till the end.
---
Thanks! I couldn’t find the reason through all the posts with people yelling at each other.
---
Tuesdays datamining post could be interesting if Anet put any season 5 stuff in the client but not in the game.
---
https://i.imgur.com/iZsw7Px.png

Imagine they resurrect Svanir, make him something like Avatar of Jormag (that can talk with us, etc.) and he will be the main evil guy in season 5...
---
Lil Esmeralda will never log in anymore.
---
dance my monkey, dance, dance!
---
The guy who got hit by lightning will propably never log in anymore.
---
&gt;      
---
&gt; well, they provided the game
---
EVERY SINGLE FUCKING POST OF YOURS IS JUST SHITTING ON THE COMMUNITY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY HOLY FUCK WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
---
almost anything competitive in GW2 is considered "elitist" to some degree.
---
Interesting take on it. I've just levelled up a guard from scratch. I had no tomes so I had to go vanilla. I forgot about boosters from laurels but I did use food, utilities and the Guild Hall exp booster from the tavern.
---
For me it's STILL quicker though to hit dungeons as soon as you get to 30. Do AC, CM, TA and of course sorrows as you level up. Not only is it a full level a path, but you obviously get your tokens and gold. Another one is to level up a craft with the matts you make from your runs. You can grab a  few levels by levelling up artifiicing/weaponmaking etc etc as you go.  I still haven't found a quicker way.
---
At least it had a better finale than GoT
---
Yeah, that’s a bullshit suspension. I’ve said a lot worse in sPvP, and while commanding AB/TD, and the most I ever got was a 3-day ban.
---
Thread removed: Spoiler(s) are not allowed in titles, feel free to re-post this without the spoiler in the title.
---
Absolutely incredible tournament, just such an epic finale that couldn't have went more intensely if it was scripted. Absolutely pathetic that ANet refused to take part, and pathetic that they've all but abandoned such an integral, and in my view, the most important part of this community.
---
Enterprise resource planning
---
when someone is living in a bubble and thinks he talks for all the casuals while the truth is that the biggest part of the gw2 community agrees that the leveling experience is one of the best because you are completly fine solo and everyone can just do it on their own pace.  
---
pro tip: search for "solo play" on reddit and gw2 forums and see what comes up.  
---
most people just chill in the game. they do not even give a single shit about your guild. they do not give a single shit about you running arround them. they won't just start a conversation because you are jumping arround them.  
---
i have the strong feeling that you have a helper syndrome tbh.
---
Ironically was the word you were looking for. Tongue in cheek.
---
I'd appeal, but I feel I'd have no ground for it to be lifted. It's just funny since this is the first ban I've ever gotten, ever.
---
Hate to shatter the illusion, but that is definitely not a community only event. I work for the production company partnering with Method to put it on. There's a lot of money and sponsorship involved behind the scenes.
---
They used a hack.
---
One of the reasons why Anet wouldn't support it.
---
Guild Wars 2 does have a very similar spectator mode implemented for watching PvP matches, but only devs (or people with special permission) can use it.
---
I legit got mad at LN on wing 6. 
---
ERP was fun.
---
Why is everyone talking about this guy? Never heard of him. Why does everyone think he should receive a sponsorship?
---
WhoDaThunkIt.
---
speak english pls
---
I'm not sure why are you getting downvotes, I'm on the same situation. I have no idea who he is and what kind of event is happening right now. Apparently it's something related to raids.
---
They went from 0 to hero in just 1 game.
---
Natureinsideme for MVP.
---
Luna for MVP.
---
I think it’s more of an attitude instead of a type of content? I mean... I do raid, build toons for different roles, practice rotation to hit higher dps, do daily T4 and sometimes CMs... but I don’t think myself an elitist, just a casual player... cause I love chilling out with friends and I don’t mind doing stuff slowly, or less effectively , and I quite enjoy them... and helping ppl in general
---
Elitists are however, who I’ve encountered quite a lot, people who yell at the rest of the team/squad whenever something is not happening perfectly, and usually makes me really uncomfortable.... but they usually do very nice dps so there’s really nothing we can say to them... 
---
Just my feeling, not sure about anything

That was just fantastic.  Thank you to all the guilds, this event doesn't happen without you.  And of course, teapot and all the other people who worked to make this happen.  I think for a lot of raiders this feels like the conclusion of gw2, and boy did you guys end it with a bang.

Yes reason why it's bannable in wvw and pvp, but there is nothing against that for pve. Also only 2 people have access to that anyway sincerely it's self made.
---
RIP 28th August 2012 - 26th August 2019
---
It was a good run.
---
**WE'RE GOING NORTH!**
---
Mark this as spoilers though
---
My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined
---
There's no point for 40 people to turn around and chase five players: they are a distraction. Your job in a big zerg when you're dealing with a tail-hugging havoc squad is *not to be the tail.*

An adequate person would know the difference between using a custom tool to spectate a big event (harming nobody) and using memory injections to gain gameplay advantage. Nobody is gonna blame a company for banning a player using spectate tool to spy on WvW enemies across the whole map LUL, even if he cries "well you allowed it during a tournament!!!".

Fistbump: You
---
Spoilers! Not everyone has Epi 3
---
Oh, he read something and now he think that he can "controll" anything. Cute. ;)
---
sT kind of forgot about the lightning mechanic.
---
No, that's just two servers being sporting, not a pattern of collusion. People want to see the negative twist to everything.1
---
Ofc, but supporting it would’ve lead to maybe double the viewers, gaining more attention to the game from Randoms and more money for anet
---
It's kinda sad when people try to make fun of it, but don't get the allusion.
---
Uhh.. because he has put in insane effort countless times and is the biggest streamer pulling off better events and views than what arena net bothers to do. He is one of the only people putting up numbers for this game.
---
Putting GW2 in top 20 alone probably made loads of people consider downloading the game.
---
I'm controlling you right now, my monkey
---
*/cringe*
---
that will be shit, like all content lately. don't get hyped so you won't be disappointed.
---
downvotes come.
---
gear?
---
PLZ just stop with all these fucking spam posts
---
remember to spoiler tag :)
---
oh grimJack the best player in the game.... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT   HAHAHA  
---
MAYBE RENAME TO GRIMKACK111ELF
---
Like they would announce to everybody on the server individually that they are doing what they are doing ... LOL
---
Oh god that commentation, more exciting that watching golf. :D
---
That is again exactly the joke
---
A six second difference in a 31 minute race is insanely tight.
---
After all the talk about how [LN] might be cracking under the pressure, one little mistake by [sT] at the very end proved to be the difference.
---
When I looked
---
GW2 total viewers: 16.4K
---
MT viewers: 15.9K
---
I don't think Anet realizes how much they're losing (as far as publicity), and that it could have been avoided if they had just listened to the players. Everything he cited for his reason for leaving have been issues for years
---
Who said they're not already there and that_shaman just is keeping that spoiler to himself. He doesn't reveal everything :)
---
What about playable Canthans?
---
Other game publisherd pay thousands of dollars to streamers to promote their games, they wouldnt do that if it didnt work.
---
you need to understand how big this event was and how much of this sub represents the end game community. This was huge and it's only fair Teapot gets recognition. After all he's done he deserves it.
