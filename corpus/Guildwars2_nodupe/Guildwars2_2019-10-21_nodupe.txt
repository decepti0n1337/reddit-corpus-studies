Also relevant to note: the same gaming website/magazine hasn't bothered to release a PoF test/article pre/close to release (as it is common for new releases). It took them several weeks (as nearly all other gaming websites, too). I'm not sure how much "media attention" GW2 still has - and if this report here isn't existing, because the text author personally fought for it and the gaming website just said "well...okay then...nothing else to report anyway".

---
&gt; Ah, so you're not bothered by skill injectors or character trading then, or even selling plex for isk?
---
Not sure where I said any of those things...

hey fuck you too buddy

Obviously gw2 is not gonna turn into a subscription mmo now that would be stupid, it was just an hypothetical discussion what if the game came out right of the gate  with a subscription model similar to other mmos.
---
I'm only familiar with WoW since that is what i play but it has basically no mtx compared to game content, you can buy character boosts to 110 which gets you to the minimum level to start the new expansion, you can get there in 3-4 days nowadays with a new character and they also give you one for free anyway when you buy the expansion. And you can buy around 20 store mounts while in-game there's over 600 obtainable mounts. I think there is also some pets but those nobody really cares about and there are over 1000 obtainable in-game anyway. Cosmetic end-game is all about transmog and mounts and all transmogs are only obtainable in-game. Then you got other services like character transfer from servers, name change, etc.
---
All i was saying is that i personally would prefer if gw2 had came out with a subscription model and for example 99% of mount skins were obtainable in-game rather than the store based mtx model for whale milking that it has now, because i love the gameplay of the game i just completely hate what the monetization has turned into. Obviously that would be a stupid idea to do now from anet perspective
---
I think that was more of a joke about how charrizard ignores Ash when he tries to to give it commands
---
Yeah taimi is my favored choice to turn to jormag.  Especially since his minions can retain their sense of self . I think she could be arrogant enough to think she can find a way to have jormag's corruption save her life without losing her mind or self.

Rest in peace to that entire dolyak farm north of the Timberline Falls moot.

No wait, I remember other Legion members joining your warband
---
As a chef, i actually appreciated the attention to detail in the ascended cooking line. Differing cultures, methods etc. The asuran sous vide thing had me laughing like mad
---
wont be surprised if theres another version that comes out thats undetectable eventually. the game is shit to play in a lot of content without them and im not going to be strong armed into paying for an inferior version of something ive had for free forever.
---
If that is what you are interested in ... no and probably never.
---
Ye, delete your comments. :D
---
While it would be a novel idea, the fact that no one decides to tell the commander that it is full and close the listing bothers me more.
---
Exactly this.
---
If Commie central hates it so much, take it all out.
---
It's a fantasy game ffs, just dream up some lore reasons.
---
Uhh literally every mmo gives out reasons especially when a large amount of players get banned and mind you there are more mmos out there than gw2

why not rune of rage though? even cheaper and without soul reaping crit chance is abysmal, despite the accuracy sigil

edit: nvm metabattle is idiotic again and doesn't take soul eater cuz math is hard i guess
---
&gt;See irony?
---
No, actually, I don't, considering here we are, in yet another ban wave right after a free tool was deactivated 2 weeks before the release of the monetized, inferior tool. Also, AFAIK, the people responsible for WW2 are no longer in control of Germany, while a huge chunk of the people responsible for Anet's previous blunders are still in the company, evidenced by the current ban wave, and the last incident being as recent as last year.
---
PvP and WvW are in a worse state than they were 2 years ago and theres not a positive outlook on it improving anytime soon. If you have path of fire theres some pve content thats fun for a bit and is worth checking out. Other than that not really
---
Check Wiki to see when it's going to spawn, then check Lfg to find groups about 20 minutes before it starts.
---
As the other poster says, it's not on a strict server-by-server basis any more.
---
Yes, people get disappointed when an NCSoft guy takes the stage that was reserved for a big announcement for 7 out of the 36 minutes or so and talks about Tidal and Funko Pops.
---
I absolutely knew that this would happen. I called it and called it and everyone was like "nah no way" I fucking knew it.
---
Simpler times
---
I've asked a couple questions in this thread, and I'm very grateful for the informative responses. Pardon me while I ask one more.. but where is the descent to madness dungeon party in LFG? I can't seem to find it anywhere
---
They could still easily write around this. Have a completely different culture them, or make something up. Use a dead one - roman, ancient greek, minoan, easter island. Heck anything if its such a big problem.
---
But their are tons of games around that use asian style stuff - and they aint all getting closed down.
---
It would be under

It will be called Asc, AtM, Ascent to Madness, Mad King, Halloween Dungeon, or any combination of them. Since it needs any 5 ppl they fill up fast and dispensar. Don't be afraid to make your own. Ppl will come.
---
I could’ve sworn there were more than 25 people in my party earlier today.

Using the newbies trying to get their Warclaw achieves as cannon fodder? I absolutely approve!

Tip: mango pie filling is 100% NPC-purchased ingredients and is ridiculously cheap, and you can get to like 440-450 cooking before it stops giving experience.
---
What /u/dreoxy said below but it should be noted that correct stat exotics are fine in raids and low tier fractals (you'll start to need more ascended as you go up in fractals but just trinkets gets you to the start of T4). If you can, getting weapon and trinkets is worth the majority of the difference while armor is only ~2% dps increase.
---
It did improve for me. Fps became a lot stable on my laptop, and, well, better too.
---
So, we gonna get banned for this too?
---
I miss ya Zambie, most of us RiT people moved over to Raid Academy. If you wanna get back in, the server's still very active.
---
Just did it, the trick is to just follow him around and plant right before he does, pretty easy doing it that way. [More info here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Forearmed_Is_Forewarned#Achievements).
---
Understandable because they make most of their revenue through the purchase of gems and gold being exchangeable for gems means they will get less purchase (although one could argue people who farm gold for gems were never really going to buy and more likely to quit than buy gems), and that's about the only measure you can give management that is within their power, albeit ineffective. 
---
Removing the exchange would probably be the final nail in the coffin and would end gw2 faster than any nerf or banwave ever will. 
---
Good to know that I should just sell all my mats rather than bother with crafting then
---
Oof

Basically all the daily metas, fractals, etc as already mentioned but [more details here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Gold_Farming) including a link to Peureki.3647's farming sheet.

I'm EU and im seeing HOT trains quite often. I've made 3 new characters in the last 3 months and been managing to find HP trains quite easy. Just join some HOT meta and ask about it during the event. You'll easy find a group and a commander who is willing to lead.
---
Just to add, as atm is halloween event it can be more difficult to find a group, as everyone are in the lab. :)
---
Well 1, I did say I support more privacy, just don't understand how it can be a serious problem as is.
---
And 2, if anyone is actually going to such an extreme waste of their time to stalk that hard, I'm just sad for them, damn.
---
Yep, I didn't have Arcane traits selected; just Air and Water.
---
MEATTOBERFEST
---
It's definitely cos of Halloween event. Maps are usually more alive than during the events like this one. This event specifically is one of the easiest way to get gold, so most of the player base are in the labyrinth (event map).
---
I’d definitely still be keen on seeing something new — I think it’s why the POF region is a totally new culture, and I think they’ve done a great job! I don’t know what state the company is in right now, if this even is a likelihood at this point (with no expansion announcements and with the layoffs).
---
I could not disagree more.
---
But I guess not everyone actually plays gw2 like I do or has already unlocked every damned achievement in the game...
---
What kind of performance increase can I expect to see on a 1050ti and a fx8370?
---
I mean, to each their own, but the core game and HoT are a really great experience without mounts. I'm glad I held off until I played through everything, the progression is very satisfying.
---
Outerworlds is due later this month!

Also amoral/immoral activies... Things that have been shown to have a way of leading to increasingly bad situations, but of themselves aren't worth society's time defining in law and dealing with.

Not just about the game, even if you don't agree with some non logical idea that they have... I dont know, im finding more common sense in the game than here.
---
*BABBLE BABBLE!*

One another note, if you don’t have the mastery and it’s out of arm’s reach, bind something to “AoE Loot” (I chose ctrl+f) and/or enable “AoE loot on interact”.
---
Reminder: ArenaNet treating their most dedicated fans like garbage.
---
They mentioned something about holidays structured around game modes, to encourage people to try em. I think I like the idea of a WvW or sPvP thing right now. They'd have to be a bit careful, but I think its a good injection of life, and could be neat as a recurring festival.

Your slide ends when you release the drift key at which point you regain maximum "grip". You just need to slide long enough to point the camera in the right direction. It takes practice.

im vegan so im not leveling cooking.

No

This video made me lol irl. So funny. Ty

That and the fact that she is mini... tiny... timy... Taimi. A mini minion. This has been planned from the start all the way back since S1!
---
Dead game. More nerfs. No expansion.
---
There’s Bowls of fruit salad &amp; veggie flatbreads at lvl 500 too, they all give 100 healing power or 100 expertise plus 7 other benefits ;-)
---
None. Halloween tends to go into November and Wintersday starts mid-December, so at most there's a 1.5 month gap between the two.
---
It's nice having a breather, especially after the grindfest that is Halloween. It also gives Arenanet a chance to put out an episode without stepping on the toes of a festival, something they hate doing.
---
This. 
---
Plus I don't want to feel obligated to play, which I would if I was paying a subscription.
---
I like that when I get burnt out on GW2 I can put it down without really realizing I'm taking a break until it's been a week or two of not touching it... then a few weeks or months later I can pick up right where I left off and I haven't lost progress, or paid for something I didn't use.
---
We have enough festivals. We'd need something new, like new LS epizode.
---
no festival. i need to grind out older maps for cheevs and theyre empty right now during halloween
---
&gt; I had a friend full on quit because he couldn't customize the UI
---
Might I add: A function that was very well present in GW1. It didn't let you replace graphics but you could move and resize every UI element as you liked. And Build templates were a free future.
---
It's still awkward to know, that GW1 had things going for it that GW2 still doesn't have or uses now to grab more money.
---
At least 2 of those cheated with a teleport hack tho at some point. The bans come in waves so 3 weeks off doesn't matter.
---
There's still hope in shattered fragments of protons and neutrons.
---
That's a surprised Pikachu right there.
---
Nothing because I think we'll get Icebrood episode 1. The thing is they have 6 festivals and 12 months in the year so they can do living world or something else one month then a festival the following month. I will say this I hope festival of the four winds is move to August next year instead of July.
---
Thanks dude:)
---
How come you paid for raid achieves instead of earning them?
---
But their company story is currently more interesting than their Living world story. So thats something I guess?
---
Is it considered cheating if you look for recipes on wiki?
---
oh wow i didnt know that. thank you
---
It already takes them too long to release Episode 1... The prologue was so fucking short. Even shorter than the already short episodes in the past.
---
I really don't get what their problem is... If they struggle to deliver full sized releases regularly then for gods sake split them up. They could easily start one episode with a smaller map and story and expand on it every 2 to 4 weeks until the next episode is ready to go. Where is their "Current Events" team? Did they all leave or is LW team 4 now on the Job?
---
The bi-weekly update cycle from LW1 was shitty because the content was deleted afterwards. The episodic format since LW 3 is also not enough with 2h of content every 3 to 4 months. So why don't they just take what they did with LW2 (expanding maps and also story in vanilla maps) and combine it with what they learned from he later seasons?
---
This is currently not a Saga and also not "living". This is a "I come back in 3 months if I can spare 2h of my life."
---
I don't see why people are so upset. I mean in any other game if you get banned for an over-sensitive protection, that catches a keyboard/mouse software macro (that may or may not be used in the game) or even cheat engine that is not attached to any process people immediately conclude "guilty".
---
It is clear that you needed to go out of your way to modify "official" releases to use disabled features. Using 3rd party tools is already prohibited, but Anet allowed it. Modifying 3rd party tools to gain an advantage in game (even if not competitive) is the very definition of hacking.
---
What is the empty string debacle?
---
The only definition of MMO that I grew up with was having a persistent world in which you can play with other players. In Guild Wars 1, once you went into the "open world" you were only there with players you'd already grouped in. 
---
Guild Wars 2 you walk into a zone and you can run into other players. A hundred on a map, in come cases.  That makes it a "massively" multiplayer online RPG, because it's obviously an RPG as well.
---
The idea that WoW took over MMO space and everyone copied it for years doesn't really change the definition of what an MMO is. In fact, long before Guild Wars 2, one of my main complaints about MMOs is that everyone talked about MMOs, but inevitably they all ended up sitting a city in a queue with the 20 people you were going to raid with, and that was it. It was the antithesis of the very definition of MMOs, and it disturbed me. 
---
I was always looking for an MMO experience, because I came to the genre through RPGs first and I wanted that immersion of being in a living breathing world.
---
And WoW did have some advantages in that area, such as seamless transitions between areas, ultimately the combination of graphic style, not enough  voice, the quest hub system, following an arrow to a star, not being able to play with people a few levels above or below you, kill and node stealing, it all left be cold.
---
If anything Guild Wars 2 was the first MMORPG I played that put the MMO back into the equation. It made me feel more, generally, like I was in a living breathing world, between the ambient dialogue, not having to talk to some dude with an exclamation mark over his head, dynamic events and yes, players everywhere, participating in events not just because they had a quest for it, but because they could help out a besieged town. I wasn't turned away if I were a level or five in either direction. I didn't need an invitation to help out. I just saw what was going on and jumped in, as I would if I lived there.
---
As far as I'm concerned, Guild Wars 2 has every right to consider itself an MMO and I don't find it misleading in any way. WoW usurping the entire definition didn't do the genre any favors in my opinion.
---
Actually, I understand a possible ban from this. It's a wrapper around the game. This executable runs GW2 inside it. Like one could make a bot.
---
Thought it was obvious by now that Anet doesn't take PvP related content that seriously outside of giving those group of players something to stop whining about occasionally.
---
No, he is using good logic...You are using hurdurdur logic by trying to equate botting and ArcDPS.
---
[Augmented Tyira](https://github.com/ideka/AugTyr), an overlay using Gw2's Mumble API.
---
Steve comin for dat booty
---
Ah, right. Forgot having to pay for the first 6 episodes of that that I missed.  
---
Right, so that's another ~~960~~ 1280 gems a new player would have to pay/grind for to get the near-full story (though at least this part could be just skipped until after Heart of Thorns and treated as a backstory).
---
This is just like the bethesda mod shop if they banned you from playing skyrim if you mod it yourself. It isn't as scummy as taking a dump on freedom, but it is still pretty scummy.
---
You represent everything that's wrong with modern gamers, not just gw2, but every single game with mtx(and there's alot of those on the market)
---
real content
---
I made a quick calculation on your power consumption.  
---
On heavy load, it uses around 320W. It seems your PSU barely cuts it.  400W at 75% efficiency is only 300W.  
---
I'd look into that first.
---
Yeah, it's very well done. The in-game recap is terrible. I found it hard to relate to all these new NPCs until I watched that video.
---
GW1 still has a very dedicated community. The main difference is, that only people who really like the game play it now. Maybe with the occasional GW2 player who want's to get some HoM points for ingame rewards. But other than that: There is no point for people to get annoyed about the state of the game.
---
At least not anymore. And believe me, there are a lot of things that we want to have changed. Balance is a big thing by the way. It even goes so far that the GW1 community is constantly asking if Arena Net would publish they source code should they ever shut down the servers. Or at least provide a singleplayer version of the game where we could make our own skill changes.
---
The sad thing with GW1 is, seeing this game slowly die. We are at a point where the main player base is small enough, that you recognize most names. Especially in Kamadan and Ascalon pre searing. And it always hurts me when another name disappears from the map chat and maybe never returns.
---
This needs to be put higher. I have an i5 Ivy Bridge and a 960 gtx, with d912pxy i get nice and stable fps in most areas and zergs/events
---
Hi, Alexander Leitsch here,
---
i work for Mein-MMO.de, a website in the same Network as Gamestar. They ask me to write a text about Guild Wars 2 and i did it as objective as possible. I mentioned a lot of bad things and that they failed at some points. 
---
If you look at the channel, you will see some more videos about SWTOR, ESO and other MMORPGs. Gamestar does not cover any of theese, but they ask people, who know about the game, to help them. Thats what i did. And it was the short way, because i work for the same network.
---
Swiss turnies for pvp are announced since several years now and it won't change the underlying issues of spvp. Cause 7 years of conquest sucks. Fuck 1 year of only conquest would have sucked. 
---
For wvw same problem. Alliances are annouced since years now and won't even come with the needed ladder/aim of actually winning a match up.
---
Furthermore templates are a desaster. No support for pvp in the first place and 0 coverage to even remotly fit the required builds and gear setups in wvw.
---
Overall there is no point in optimism.
---
&gt; committed some unrelated offense
---
I can confirm they don't ban for that.... I had a few guildies who were trying their luck... They just force the player to rename the character (I think they reset it to a random string of characters and force a name reset). 
---
They might perma ban if you abuse this.
---
I can clearly see weapons utilised
---
Don't bother with gw2 anymore. Anet has successfully managed to remove all trust they gained during gw1.
---
Conspiracy theory: Anet is doing shit on purpose so the game dies and they can move on to another franchise
---
[removed]
---
*Ranger nerfings:* ranger got some significant buffs last patch. (They reworked sword &amp; changed the GS 4 block to something MUCH better than before)
---
*Thief nerfings:* Thiefs don't really get nerfs, they more off get "changed". It's always meta in sPvP and there's always at least one build, with which a good player can fk up others in 1v1.
---
*Playerbase:* *in sPvP* it's fairly small. You can become top 250 fairly easy (if you have some skill). You still usually find a game in less than 2 minutes. It get worse when you reach platin. But if you're just a "gold" level player, you can have a lot of fun in sPvP, with low matching time and fairly ballanced teams.
---
*In WvW* it's also shrinking, especially the GvG sceene. Ballance patches and missing support / content for the GvG sceene is driving them away.
---
*PvE* player base is fluctuating. If there's new content, then there's quiet a bunch of people. There's also a constant flow of new players coming to the game, but I guess also a constant flow away. You still always find people / groups for big open world events, dungeons, fractals, ect. almost 24 / 7.
---
*New expansion:* No. For the time beeing it sounds like Anet will stick to the Living World - free content - system. And they want to add "DLC worthy" content to the game, by this LS system. We have no clue what Anet will deliver and they also stated "DLC's are not off the table".
---
I got forced to change my name and changed it to something else, apparently still offensive ("Walking Is Mine" as bomb laying engie, whats the problem?).
---
Eitherway, I got banned for an hour and had to name change again. Pretty sure they would have banned for way longer if I choose another name they don't like.
---
Surprisingly though, I had the initial name for nearly 4 years without issues and the playtime at the time of the ban was a less then 5 minutes, so how that got reported is beyond me.
---
Yep it was in december 2013, if you purchase 800 gems u get green quagan back pack, and with 4000 gems you get Mr Sparkles mini, which is bigger then asura. This is last time, what i remember, when you get reward for purchasing gems
---
Don't forget that people get actual harassment and threats over this kind of stuff.
---
we dont need more copy and paste festivals on repeat, so anet doesn't have to provide contend
---
All founders have left. Majority of core developers have left. Whatever we have now isn't the ArenaNet that many players have come to know.

It's essentially like some completely unknown company has taken over the game.

It's the top thread so it's not being obscured. Being a mod for forums in the past, you don't want dozens of threads all for the same topic, it becomes a nightmare to manage and moderate the people who are actually breaking the rules.
---
&gt; You've yet to give any sort of point in this regard.   
---
...  
---
 your argument is really childish.
---
Okay, since you're clinging the my analogy. I am sorry for using an analogy that seems to be inappropriate. so I will try to say what I mean explicitly. I was not trying to equate not trying to call all players botters. I was trying to make a sarcastic remark pointing out the irony in linking "enhancements" to fandom, by saying all botters use "enhancements", while clearly none of them are big enough of fans to care for the game's economy. I hope that clarifies any misunderstandings you had(intentional or unintentionally).
---
**To summarize my stance:**  
---
If you or anybody else got banned without using the modified version of ardcdps then I wish you all the best and I'll probably be active for a while on this topic supporting review of bans. Hell, even if people got drawn into it by accident (as is common, a friend refers to a "working" build template download link) I don't think they deserve bans.
---
If somebody got banned while using the modified version knowing full well ArenaNet disapproves. I honestly hope all of them stay perma-banned. If you are going to defend use of illegal tools knowing that they are illegal then **you are the one who is being childish** and I suspect I know why.
---
i've been banned before just for general swearing..
---
Every ban that anet does, they setup a ticket where the banned user can sign into their account on anet's site to view it.  In there it would explain why their account was suspended.. if it was cuz of 3rd party program or otherwise. So far every post claiming to be banned no one even shows the reasoning.  When you even sign into your account it shows the reason on the purple pop up message.
---
RnT does the slot after Evos. Post reset is generally organized by RnT but is not officially an RnT slot (meaning anyone can help command). Preset is anarchy, basically.
---
Whatever man, I’m just pointing out that both Anet and the mod makers **warn you** that you use the mods at your own risk and that plenty of people play just fine without them. The lack of self awareness being display by people who **realized the mod was shut down and discontinued** and decided to **try to circumvent that** and are now **permabanned as a result of their own rule breaking** is pretty funny. “But some of them were using legit versions.” Yeah and murder Joe in prison for multiple stabbings who’s killed three more people since going to prison is innocent because he did it all in self defense, lawyer just fucked him. Totally believable. 
---
Anet has made their position on third party software clear by enforcing these bans. Their stance is “unofficially, use some mods of you want to, but officially, we’ll ban people who use mods we don’t want being used.” So there you have it, wanna play it safe? Don’t use mods.

---
Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
Delay? Pfft. Thanks for helping :-)
---
Well, If it's one per day - and you can harvest like 5-6 I guess? That's around 1200 Candy if your doing it every day in the year. It's probably not worth it - as you can farm 1200 Candy pretty fast during the event. I will skip the home upgrade for now.
---
I own both expansions, so I'm guessing I have all stats. OK. So if I understand correctly - Berserker will always have Power, precision and ferocity. But each weapon type will have it own amount of stats. So if I own Axe A, and find another Axe A (same weapon), stats will be the same if I pick Berserker. But if I'll find Axe B, and pick Berseker, It will have the same stats (power, prevision, ferocity), but the value of the stats will be different because it's Axe B and not Axe A?  
---
Well, I guess that at end game, you do need to take account the Power stats, because a weapon with more weapon strength but less lower, might be weaker compared to weapon with high weapon strength but tons of power. It's not something I'm going to handle while leveling, I probably just going to stick with the weapon strength - but it's something to keep in mind while hitting 80. Thanks!
---
Set the max amount of players to be visible to medium, thats the biggest killer. Also use dx912pxy for a big boost.
---
&gt;So an exotic berserker's sword at level 80 gives exactly the same amount of stats as all other level 80 berserker's swords.
---
But if I'll find a Berseker's Axe - while it's still berseker and will have power, precision and ferocity - the stats amount will differ?
---
Oh, I see. I was sure you can change the selectable stats. But It seems to be only possible in ascended gear. Thanks! :-)

Path of Exile. Warframe. Destiny 2 joined ranks.
---
All handle their community and games quite well, deliver product at reasonable pace (in first case on insane pace) and can be played at full extent free unlike Guild Wars 2 b2p with glorified trial.
---
Eve-Online is paranoia simulator, not fashion wars...
---
I think when you leave the tutorial, the waypoints to every starting zone is unlocked now. Invite him to a group, find him on the map, and look for a waypoint, it should be near to where he is.
---
Good of you to volunteer for the job of pocket raptor wrangler.
---
How do you switch so quickly? New player
---
Afair you have to take a jackal portal into a room that is sealed off completely. A flying mount would not be able to get you in there.
---
yea totally 30k or 40k same shit right? lmao
---
a mere 33% dps difference really barely noticeable

And mass banned players that fell off the metrica province jumping puzzle too.
---
\[Unlock reply for 800gems\]
---
If I remember correctly, an item for each of the specialization weapons were at the end of a jackal puzzle (closed off rooms only available by sand portal). 
---
For Warpblade specifically it was in one of the big pots in the water in Desert Highlands. You needed the skimmer's higher jump to get in, but that could probably be bypassed. 
---
You will need the jackal mastery though, because the chest with riddle itself is in a pot that's upside-down and underwater - completely closed up, with the only way to get in via sand portal.
---
Think of each map as locked in a time. The is the only way things can work as you progress through a story. You defeat a big boss, yet the big boss is still terrorizing the natives who ask you for help to defend against them. Each new map in the expansions and living world represents an increase in time, however it does get confusing when you go back in time to old Lion's Arch, not knowing that it was destroyed and rebuilt later in the story.
---
What?
---
Maybe. Maybe my title was poorly chosen. That says nothing about the video and its quality. Instead of down voting because I used a bad title, we could discuss the video itself.
---
But that's not something reddit users would do.
---
Already did. Ain't my fault some people too dense to understand sarcasm :)
---
If there is something reddit users hate more than reposts it's click bait titles. This is as bad as I would use the title "The perfect car" and the video I link has the title "The perfect family car".
---
Whisper the commander to ask what you need to do in order to join the squad.
---
"Closed raid" guilds usually always look for new players and requesting to join should not be a problem. The good ones will offer recommended builds and training should you lack the necessary skill.
---
Squads that are closed often just want players to join the necessary voice channel for communication. If it is not advertised in map you can ask for this, either in map or through whisper.
---
It honestly does not take much to join closed squads and squads are usually closed for specific reason. All it takes is a bit of confidence to be included and for the wellness of WvW as a game mode far more casual and pug players should be proactive with this.
---
Just stop defending yourself.
---
If you had owned up to it with something like 'yeah the title is mistaken, my bad' and didn't use passive-aggressive BS while saying that, there wouldn't be as much downvotes
---
&gt; We are now the ages of kick starter and mobile game development where game financial success come form individuals called whale .
---
If you look at games as art... well it was common in the past and is in the present to have "sponsors" for major income of the artist while art itself always "property" of the masses that did not payed as much or at all to the author.
---
Maybe things just setting in their place in the human society?
---
Except for the fact that they always attack whenever someone is in range it took me way too long to notice they wer ebots. 
---
I mean half the people in PvP don't write anything and sub gold the bots are probably as good as the players.
---
When you finish your personal story just watch the living season 1 movie by dreamyabaddon on YouTube. It'll fill you in because it's no longer playable and it'll make living season 2 make way more sense.
---
So can you explain what it is?
---
That's true....  topics that really need attention remain pushed back. There was a topic about problems in pvp and what? where is this topic?nobody cares!  But, Instead, we put “likes” with fucking sylvari/charr/flowers pictures.....What wrong with us ?  We really like to pretend that everything is okay with the game. We really love gw2  Pictures are more important.
---
As you can see in the comments, classes are mostly personal Preference. 
---
Find something you like first, optimize later.   
---
All classes have DPS builds viable up into the most difficult endgame.
---
helpful. thanks.
---
I know. Right? I joined the game after they retired the instance and I never got to witness it. I really wish I could.
---
Nice work. Just curious, why did you choose Dx12 over Vulkan?
---
So can one of you Russians explain what the hell this is about?
---
a sylvari drawing will get pushed to the top and remain on the front page for a decent amount of time while posts that critique or want to discuss problems will see little to no upvotes or be downvoted quickly
---
Make me, I only kneel for Oswald Thorn
---
I'm just glad I get another shot at the tower. I need it to finish the last of the backpack stuff.
---
Да просто смирись уже что это не настолько важно
---
This! The gameplay and it's economy was majorly influenced by the people who played it. The very low investment for max. level armor and weapons with max. stats was good for the casual player, who just wanted to enjoy the game. If you wanted to get more out of it, you had to do hardmodes and later dungeons that required heavy team synergies to not get steamrolled by the first group of enemies.
---
You could also work on a character that could farm certain things solo, er rush people through missions and earn extra cash. Most of my GW1 platin was earned because I sold 6 of 8 party slots for the last EotN mission. A notorious difficult mission in the beginning that not many people were able to complete by themselves. Even with the implementation of Heroes in Nightfall and EotN.
---
The whole economy was dictated by the playerbase. There was no TP. If you wanted to get something specific you either had to farm for it, or ask around ingame if someone sells it. This meant, that people had a reputation to lose if they try to rip of others. It still happened, but you only had to put one character on ignore to never see this account again. And there was a whole message board dedicated for trader reviews. So if the person you wanted to trade with had bad reviews or no entries at all, you could still back out of the deal.
---
The whole game felt more organic because of all of this. In GW2, I barely recognize anyone in the game. There is never really any need to talk to someone if you are not interested in Raiding. And that's sad for an game that labels itself an MMO.
---
That kind of greedy monetization is actually a very concerning sign. I personally do not play GW2 anymore because I don't trust Anet to handle this MMO properly.
---
&gt; Though I do agree, if it is the modified templates, now would be a good time to come out and set the record straight. 
---
Yes. And given the recent and upcoming changes, a statement that the reason was not the modified templates would benefit everyone, if that was indeed so.
---
Fresh Air - an air trait that causes the cooldown of air attunement to be reset every time you critical hit. So you can Air Overload, fire attunement, immediately swap back to air, and Air Overload again in like 6 seconds with alacrity or whatever. The small downtime in between swapping attunement is where you cast high-impact weapon skills like air 5 and fire 3/5, as well as glyph of storms in air).

Need advice. Tryed to play rev couple of times, but i always find myself so useless. I trying to burst, but i get bursted before i even can do something. Feeling too squishy. Not enough stunbreakers (actually F1 and riposte?), too slow cleanse. I feel like i spending all my time trying to survive. What i doing wrong? May be i need to perfectly learn all other classes, and place well timing evades against hard hitting skills?
---
Anet being messy is the only consistent thing they are capable of.
---
&gt; Every time I see a post from this sub come across my screen it's just anet doing dumb shit again.
---
Most of it just comes from it being reddit and being dominated by, how to put it, a small, not representative subgroup of players. If it weren't for the occasional useful information, I'd rather dump the GW2 reddit and play the game a little more.
---
A man never walks out on his life's project unless there's nothing to save anymore. MO leaving is a bigger deal than some make it out to be.
---
I constantly make this mistake, it doesn't help when it's streng**th**, but it's heig**ht**
---
As someone who used to do manual TS verifications for a WvW server many moons ago, thank you so so so so much for making Discord bots that do all the hard work. &lt;3
---
as others have mentioned the answer is almost certainly no. i find it also worth mentioning that grinding all masteries up to and including jackal should take far less time than getting a skyscale.
---
It might help to quietly speak it out for yourself and listen to the sound the words end on.
---
could it be steve?
---
Some people set their mounts to different keyboard inputs, but I personally switch with just my mouse 😂.
---
You get used to it after awhile, but do whatever feels right with you!
---
is the source code anywhere online?
---
he's playing thief. It's the one class that relies the least on weapon swapp.
---
For what it's worth, as a new player if it was just the core f2p game I would have quit the game for good after around 2-3 weeks. Or maybe a few more because the combat is so great. But it wouldn't have lasted. I think "years" is a massive stretch. You basically have to pay to get to the good stuff IMO, and going full f2p imposes relatively severe limitations to the experience (things like trading etc).
---
Being very frank, the core wasn't all that impressive to me these days. I don't mean bad, it was pretty good, but not enough for sustained play. Living World, HoT and beyond was what really truly hooked me. The design started steadily tightening up on all fronts.
---
Bid "x" number of Gems to skip the queue - highest bidder wins, and the person who has the longest time on map (without a commander tag enabled) is mysteriously DC'd.
---
idk, but despite that, I don't envy their jobs. If their external business environment is just a reflection of what their internal structures are like. I imagine it must take years to get even the most basic requests escalated... I bet the staff are really getting sick of it too.
---
This looks very nice!
---
Is it possible to add requirements to the bot, such as &lt;1000 achievement points required for successful activation?
---
Our voip server has a few problems with "spies" from other wvw worlds listening. Using an automated system would essentially allow alt accounts from everyone free access to it.
---
In such a case, move the zerg away from the Viscount and do Steve first. He will follow, the viscount will not, and alone they are a lot easier.
---
Afaik they are releasing Episode 1 in November.  The two weeks after that will probably contain a WvW week event or perhaps another PvE Blitz style event.
---
You're doing God's work; the poor optimization is one of the biggest drawbacks this game has compared to its counterparts
---
&gt; is there any other way to meet and play together ?
---
Just in case you're not aware of it, [dlgamer has Path of Fire for $20 right now](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807). That will unlock all of the expansion content and remove all of the f2p restrictions for $20. Also, dlgamer is an official Arenanet reseller, so no worries about scam keys.
---
This is what happens when you have snowflakes for employees. I'm sure Anet headquarters has a record breaking amount of cry rooms and other forms of "safe" spaces allotted to them to get through these trying times.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Anet has been flipping off the player base in gw2 since 2013
---
Eh, it's English, you can just make a new word up. 'Strenght', a portmanteau of 'strength' and 'height', meaning high strength.
---
I love people putting down work on their characters and only seeing it themselves. I mean, I have a decent PC and I am on lowest char / model. :-)
---
Looking to finish Core Tyria masteries.. I have a good chunk of mastery points and know how to get these easily but the xp is a bit slow since I usually just get xp from dailies and a few additional fractals.
---
If I wanted to grind out the exp quickly would running Lab Farm or Silverwastes be more beneficial?
---
Thanks!
---
LOL? Not necessarily, regardless you cant deny that it's a mechanic that every new player should become familiar with.
---
The amount of people who ignore weapon swapping is astounding.
---
When you use it in wvw those buffs that don't work there are rolled as transformation. You have a little research if the chances of getting any kind of result - here, from wiki: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Candy_Corn_Gobbler/Drop_rate_(PvE)
---
That's good to know.  I use it mostly in WvW.  But sometimes I want Magic Find for PvE.  So I go to WvW so I don't get all those other buffs like speed and such.  But you're saying it doesn't matter?  The odds of getting magic find is the same in WvW and outside of WvW?
---
Yes. It's actually nicely crafted in that way. It doesn't leave a lot of mess around.
---
nobody kinda suggested you how to start building your thief, so I'll try to help:
---
**Go for trickery first**. It will grant you more initiative (you can use more weapon skills) and it will unlock traits that grant you a bunch of usefull boons upon using Steal (F1).
---
If you feel, you die too fast in many encounters, then go **Acrobatics second**. It will boost your energy recovery (more dodging) and also grant you swiftness after dodging (very nice to just travel a bit faster through the world).
---
If you want more damage, then critical strikes might be your best option in early levels (and if you really want to be a gunslinger, it's best for pistols)
---
\----------
---
I suggest you to go for Power and precision gear. If you struggle to survive, rather choose defensive traits, &amp; utility skills than defensive gear stats.
---
Utillity skills: Are up to what you like most.
---
I like the "Withdraw" heal skill most, because it is also a dodge, builds distance to your  target and it cleanses some nasty conditions all in one.
---
Besides this I like the trick skills a lot, but there are also other very fun and useful abilities like all the signets with their strong passive effects or shadow step, ect.
---
And here's the wvw rates table https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Candy_Corn_Gobbler/Drop_rate_(WvW)
---
wvw rank also needs `progression` :)
---
It really has been a fantastic ride for a new player. The lack of gearing pressure and just so many areas/things to go for (for now), feels like I always have something to do.
---
My only major dislike is the steady descent into daily stuff. I don't mean the daily achievements, but rather the way daily caps on LW currencies etc are handled. Even some PoF collections where you have to gather 10x of 5 different things in 5 different maps with an arbitrary daily cap of 1 each. It starts to diminish the ability to casually concentrate on one thing per session, and rather encourages compressing everything into a daily routine. Which I guess is their goal.
---
WTF? Another spam? Stop it, please
---
Lab farm can be pretty good, specifically with a group and some boosters but the main reason would be that it's highly populated right now and not bad for festival rewards and gold.
---
Yes, as you will be transformed into some festive thingy in the place you'd get rejuvenation boost for instance. Hope that helps!
---
Go to snowcrows.com and check out the open world or raid builds for your class, they go in detail on what and how you should play.
---
2: Yes, you can do all of them.
---
yap when i load a map it seems to happen more frequently, i notice it specially when a raid boss starts, but it also happens even after that, about quickly panning the camera doesnt seem to affect it
---
1/2. You can play old content if you boost, replay core story, eyplore the maps, anything. Main disadvantage is that youll end up overwhelmed and confused by everything. And if you care for story youd obviously have to catch up anyway. Necro is really good dmg spec for ppl that arent looking for much complexity. But overall its really mediocre class, and isnt really liked in endgame content. Healing isnt good either. If you wanna be dps and healer, your good choices would be guardian or ranger. 
---
3. Fractals are sorta similiar. They are basicaly dungeons, split between 4 tiers of difficulty, each containing 25 levels to get trough, each with daily changing negative effects. Fractals 99 and 100 also have challange mode, which makes them basicaly raid difficulty, with more complex and punishing mechanics, some new mechanics, and better rewards. 
---
There is meta for both fractals and raids, both in terms of classes used, and composition of them.
---
* Necromancer is an odd choice for healing...most classes in the game can be build to heal somewhat, but you will get odd looks and maybe even some kicks from parties. So it is easier if you play something that is "meta". If you want to swap between healing and dps, only 3 classes come to mind that are "meta": guardian, renegade and (to a degree) druid.
---
* as far as I am aware you can replay everything at every level
---
* fractals are quite similar to m+, but they do not scale to infinity. and yes there is a meta: if you want to run high end, aka the cms it is heavily encouraged to play meta builds - you can find more info on builds and compositions here https://discretize.eu/guides/fractal-basics
---
You still get exp from discovering new recipes of any level. I used the wiki to fill out what I haven't learned yet.
---
Soooo I finally finished my ascended gear and my AR is up to 151. I was excited because regular fractals are just too easy, I really wanted to go into CMs.
---
Turns out you need a bunch of achievements to even get the npc for starting CM. I'm bummed, the achievements don't look too easy to get with a PUG.
---
I really ought to join a static group, but my playing schedule is really bad. I can never say when I'll be home to play.
---
Do you really want to argue about this?
---
Whispers softly: "edgyyyyy"
---
what u/Moonshainu says and don't to afraid to ask in the map chat or open a group for hero points
---
Never heard of the productivity triangle :) Good rule of thumb.
---
For me in open world scepter/warhorn works good in open world, with tempest traitline and fresh air trait. Basically the snow crows power tempest build will work. It has some nice heals (water 5 and earth 4), as a toughness boost (earth 2), some fillers to get back to air quickly (fire 2,3 and water 2).
---
I took the earth and fire dmg shouts in my utility slots, the heal shout and FGS as elite. The mobility of FGS in nasty situations is really good.
---
Good luck!
---
Thx so much for adding a frame limiter, I've wanted something like this for a while, since gw2 only has 30fps and 60fps options. It stops my gpu overworking itself producing excessive framerates when nothing is going on around me which also stops the micro-stutters caused by gsync switching off when the framerate goes higher than my monitor's max rating.
---
I think you can still do CMs if you join a party which has someone whom can start CM?  
---
As for achievements you can post LFG for those those specific fractals, and depends of what time do you play it may be easier to fill or not.
---
horse
---
What makes you think that it is the best MMO on the market? Apart from your personal opinion?
---
I don't see why that would be the case as of today... when there are a lot of other MMOs that definitely 'do' better.
---
1. Necro works as dps and as offhealer but is far from meta.  
---
better classes would be ranger which works as dps (not meta) and as meta main heal  
---
Guard which is a meta dps and can be offhealer 
---
2. Yes No, noone can ,Yes
---
3. If M+ is Mythic+ no we don't have that  
---
Ye we have a meta for PvE content generalising the meta into stuff like 1 tank 1 heal etc does not work cause every content has a different meta. You could even say every Boss has a different meta.
---
Because I came here to see Skorvald dying in 6.16s, isn't that obvious? I don't really care about a guy soloing a boss.
---
That's Streight.
---
If I recall correctly, it was specifically "greenlit" by ArenaNet, while another mod that offered the same features, alongside other features ArenaNet weren't happy with, was met with the creator being banned after being told to remove such features.
---
You don't.

You can delete it in your system, you could even delete your account.
---
But you will never truly leave.
---
It will always be there.

Forever.

If that were the case his PC would crash, not perform badly. If the PSU is of a good brand it wont have any problems even at that low wattage.
---
Personally id still replace it if it is as old as the PC itself.
---
Stack of candy is like 1g and it gives u about 3-5h xp boost. 50% more to wxp and reward track easily gives u back that 1g, other boosts are pretty much meaningless.
---
Yup.
---
You can bypass the skimmer by flying to the platform, but you can't bypass jackal.
---
It's one of at least 6 rooms in the game that are completely sealed off unless you use a jackal.
---
you mean to tell me that issues that only affect a subsection of the playerbase doesn't get as much traction as art everybody that plays the game can at the very least appreciate. truly shocking
---
Your post summarizes how I feel exactly. I started playing GW years before Factions was released and remember playing the beta area for factions they let us play on prior to it’s full release (the money drop rates were insane in the beta) so I remember the best years of GW.
---
I ran a Guild with 2 friends I met in game that I became very close to and completed the campaign. I used my Ranger/ Necro majority of the time prior to making my assassin who I Maine’s the rest of the time I played.
---
Guild Wars had real heart and a thriving online interconnected player base, GW2 lacks heart and the open community.
---
&gt; will never know 100% who is truthful or lying
---
As is common with ban waves, there's usually at least one person who comes to reddit and claims an unfair ban, and if it blows up enough, ANet eventually shows up with the receipts.
---
Is the source available? I'd like to read the exchange if possible.
---
fill ur bags with candy, leave autoclikcer on over night, when u wake up u have week of all the boosts, easy, shame actually now that the boosts are limited to 1 week, was fun stacking a month of xp boost when gobbler was first introduced
---
Let's say that depents on the group.  
---
Some will accept everything as soon as it clasifies for the job  
---
ppl who enforce meta will kick everything that isn't a soulbeast, weaver,Dragonhunter, Firebrand, warrior/berserker (you need both) or a renegade  
---
Some will play their own comps that gets the job done but are way slower than meta or close to meta comps.  
---
Scourge Comp would be an example for those
---
That’s a good deal.
---
I mean you probably know about this a lot better then I do, but [Vulkan has slightly better performance](https://www.anandtech.com/show/11223/quick-look-vulkan-3dmark-api-overhead), but the main reason I ask is because I'm biased and would prefer the portability of Vulkan and with it being cross-platform with Linux.

If you move the install location of a program by just cutting and pasting it kind of messes with your registry and won't show in add/remove programs.  You can move it back to its original location and sometimes that works or you'll just have to delete the files and then edit your registry to fully remove it.  If you don't edit your registry your Windows still "thinks" it's installed, in a manner of speaking.
---
In the future, if you want to move the installation location of a program, either uninstall it at its current location and then reinstall or there are tools to move programs but most free ones are kind of meh.  Steam actually allows you to move install locations as well if its a steam game.
---
Wait, do we actually have an instanced Hoelbrak version? **[REDACTED]**'s funeral, right?

The truth is you cant belive even your best friend or neighbor to 100%, like most of the victims knows the criminal/perpetrator.

As with all third party tools, it is : Use at your own risk. Always.
---
Fur.
---
Aw man, you know how wishy-washy that is. Just tell us if we need to fuck off of that or if it's fine, like the rest of ArcDPS.
---
Most of the time you are free to join any commanders you see. If you click their tag on the map it will let you join squad. The worst that can happen is they don't accept your join request so give it a shot!
---
I never saw a commander in WvW.
---
I can only speak as a WvW only player. The rewards were so shit and before they even implemented the reward tracks we have now. If I missed dailies or forgot to craft my daily cool downs it could mean I can't afford food for WvW raid nights
---
As someone who was born and raised in England, lives there to this day and speaks no other language...
---
I can't say it either :(
---
5 dozen accounts? Well that explains a lot, that's about 60ish accounts which would make it seem like a ban wave.
---
I don't see what that has to do with dick size.
---
That is the policy. Third party software may be changed by whoever makes or uses it to lead to severe breach of the terms of use for the game. As such, I cannot give you a "use whatever you please, it's cool" - because we have no control over it or the changes that may be made to it. What looks fine today could be modified in the next hour to break the rules, and then if users get banned, they would point at my statement.
---
So, third party tools, tools we cannot control and have no say over what they may do in the future, cannot be OKed by me or anyone.
---
As such, they are "use at your own risk".
---
Good grief, one cheater and his ~60 shared accounts caused all this drama? Glad I took this whole thing with a bucket of salt.
---
It's the only source of karma boosters outside of a bunch of niche ways to acquire them. Your decision.
---
I'd rather be banned than play without a dps meter at this point
---
If you buy path of fire from official retailer, you will get heart of thrones for free, base game is always included in any expansions (Hot or PoF)
---
So it's not even automated bot detection that had an exception for gear/trait swap removed when it became irrelevant, like I theorized. It simply has nothing to do with build templates. But all those people who have decided to hate on the official templates because of their limitations or the gemstore tied to them (debate about this is out of topic), were too happy to jump on the ban cases and jump to conclusions and circlejerk memes about how it must be related.
---
&gt; In fact, if I recall correctly, there was only one single case of false positives in the past 7 years +.

“We gave you a live announcement telling you what you already know!! Aka communication” - Anet PR team
---
Thanks
---
Just as an update i've put it on the backlog.
---
 People still play it so it's never too late. Right now the Halloween event is going on so you'll be able to participate in that.
---
You should try out the free version , it has a ton of content and if you enjoy it, pickup Path of Fire cause it comes with Heart of Thorns.
---
The temperature of the subreddit is not pointing to ANet getting the benefit of the doubt much around here, so it's kinda expected.
---
It would be very odd for them to not be allowed and even if they were not, Anet cannot fight against it. Macros are becoming more and more implemented into actual hardware. That would mean Anet would have to blacklist mouse &amp; keyboard drivers which will never happen. Basically what this means is that regardless of what they say, macros are safe to use.
---
How about giving an okay at specific functionalities?
---
I get you cannot allow 3rd party software for the reasons you said, but maybe you can say if a 3rd party build template is fine. Or if parsing game data to determine DPS is fine.
---
Then users can check a 3rd party software and see if it's "fine" in its *current* state.
---
F2p is only "core" game, so you will NOT have mounts (PoF) or glider (Hot)
---
I don't trust this excuse at all. Some scapegoat cheater with a million accounts on his disposal? Sure. 
---
Plus there is an especially funny "discussion" about what is "allowed" addon-wise down the branch. He is just simply unable to give a clear answer and tries to move the possible threat of such addons from a-net's bans to the their malicious authors, despice being asked for the first case specifically.
---
Which is why this subreddit is going down the tubes fast...
---
In addition to the rest of these, you can't *get* a Griffon without the other mounts.
---
Not really. Arc templates were only allowed until they had their own solution.  This was never a secret, it was openly stated.
---
Specifically modifying a third party program to be able to use it again now that it's not allowed is a good way to get banned.
---
Their big mistake was ever letting anyone use the program at all.
---
If they hadn't we wouldn't be in this mess with people claiming they have 60 build per character (yes, there was an actual post claiming it which included a build for being in cities for some reason).
---
Just make sure that poor baby is safe, y'hear? 's all good.
---
Tank has you know wasn't "necessary" if GW2. GW2 aggro or threat system isn't like WoW or other MMO. All ennemies have different reaction and will attack by different set of rule that are rarely under someone control (the tanks in most MMO). So you will never see someone saying he will tank in Open World, Donjon or Fractal.
---
In Raids, some people(s) will be the "Tank" (they will get attack by boss and move him) but what they need to be the tank will change depending the fight; 
---
- Some boss attack the one with more toughness (a stats that decrease damage you get), 
---
- others will aggro if someone do something before the fight or during the fight 
---
- and some bosses will just select someone randomly.
---
To maximize group, most team use Healer has "Tank" this day because with the flexibility of GW2 you could do both without to much problem. Renegade or Firebrand are amazing at Healer, Tank and Support (support are IMO the third type of class in GW2 and they provide Buff to everyone) all at the same time. And like you could see some builds could be Dps, Healer and/or Support at the same time.
---
you already said it's ok to use arcdps, what's the difference now
---
Not a native speaker, did not teach the language to others. Said that on the second try .__.
---
That was more than 5 years ago, though. I'm sure I'm not the first new player who noticed this. ;)
---
's all good. I don't like users being spooked by rumours, that's all.
---
If anything,. I hope the message of: Do Not Share Your Accounts gets out. That's all I can hope for.
---
'Won't be banned for it now and if it stays like it is and doesn't stray into bannable area' I'd say. I just find it really weird that they have that 'lol guess' policy with accouts on the line.
---
One day I might be able to ask the policy maker why they don't just make a list of officially sanctioned addons with the note that they have no control over them and their developers might do something with them at any time that will lead to bannable offences before Anet can react and remove it from the list, so it will be forever a 'use at your own risk' thingy.
---
Guesswork and speculation usually goes in the direction of how they just don't want to have to deal with that kind of mess and would rather discourage their uses as much as possible. But, well, that's just guesswork and speculation.
---
I hate that I have to guess and speculate.
---

---
New around here? This has been the answer for the past 7 years when people ask about external programs.
---
Free version is basically a trial. You don't have access for most modern and relevant content and mechanics.
---
You can access Eir's Homestead at any point, even if you don't have a story step taking you there. 
---
Same goes for Knut Whitebear's Loft, and the Hunter's Hearth. And there's one instance in Veins of the Dragon but it can only be accessed during the story step Twilight of the Wolf
---

*side eyes*

At your own risk. Always. Functionalities can be changed as much as the whole package. I will not OK any third party tool, or any part of it.
---
🙄 this sub now...
---
2hours of boost from one stack in WvW? Sounds like bad luck. I've gotten 8hours in PvE from 2 stacks and 5hours in WvW from one stack. Regardless of where I use the gobbler, I seem to get a fairly even amount of time on the XP booster. MF boosts last almost 2x as long if I do it in WvW though.
---
Thx for the update but god you guys should tell us this stuff earlier.
---
Right. Let me rephrase: instances that allow you to have a look at the rest of Hoelbrak.
---
Correct, if you only play the free version you will get the entire base story. Lvl 1-80. 
---
Getting the DLCs will give you elete specs, gliders and Mounts. Extra maps etc
---
There are also the "living world" story episodes that have additional maps and story which you will have to purchase in game.
---
...or...you can simply practice till you learn how to do it, or abandon hope and move on since it's not for you. Every single content does not need to be completed if you cannot complete it yourself.
---
TLDR: Get good, or move on.
---
Are you on NA or EU? From what I've seen, EU servers organise on Discord. Find the biggest/lead server for whichever group you're paired with and find their discord. Peak times are best if you want huge, organised squads with decisive leadership. NA also sees a lot less LFG use generally, from what I gather. 
---
My advice: just go in and start doing stuff on your own. If it's not peak times, just head in and flip camps and do the smaller target stuff and gradually you end up accumulating a little ad hoc group of people. Keep an eye on the dailies and head in and do those when they match up with your goals. 
---
I got all the warclaw stuff and my two gifts of battle doing that - I find the big squad stuff too much of a chore and I cannae be bothered with it.
---
lol
---
That is hilarious
---
Reality is - and this is a hard one to stomach for some people - subreddits act as a microcosm of humans in general. People always panic over stuff they care about, and they speculate about stuff they don't know. We as a species always try to come up with explanations for stuff we don't know - Pantheons of Gods to explain why ancient civilisations had good and bad harvests, etc. This weekend's drama is no different. The root issue isn't the behaviour of the poeple on this subreddit, as that will never change, just like it hasn't changed for the past 3000 years. The root issue is the complete lack of community management from ArenaNet.
---
They never say anything.
---
A simple message from CM saying "We've banned a number of accounts linked to a user who was utilising hacks in PvP" would have been lauded by the community - people would be *praising* ArenaNet! But no, they say nothing, and the entirely *predictable* response that all communities gives happens. 
---
Don't blame the people, as they're just doing what people do; panic and speculate. Blame ArenaNet for continuallying failing to understand the importance of community management.
---
Which is directly related to Anet’s performance over the last year as well
---
If there are more than 22 players in the squad for Lab then it's more than likely full. That one squad on your list with 42 players looks like it's a merge of 2 squads from different instances. Basically, just scroll down and join the squads with 22 or less people. Joining a squad with more than that is just going to make it hard to tag mobs anyway.
---
no i dont find that weird, because imo every class should be able to use every weapon and it shouldn't be locked behind specialisations
---
What nostalgia
---
Wasn't this done on the weekend? It seems they picked the best time to do it, on top of the whole template drama. It might not be as simple as you make it seem, for instance, the manager might have no idea why people were banned, so he has to ask the department responsible for it, and since it is weekend and everyone at home, they might not answer the phone, and until a clear answer can be given, nothing can be said or it could become worse. I would personally turn off my workphone during the weekend because the last thing i want to hear when i'm at home spending time with my family is that reddit is screeching about something.
---
And dorn did adress this whole fiasco as fast as he could during his workday on monday.
---
Why did you ban the whole pvp scene.
---
Of the 18 elite specs, only two do not have a SC build that uses that weapon - Scrapper (Hammer) and Dragonhunter (Longbow).
---
Actually it isn't a weird policy because it is an external third party they can't maintain any level of control or security . Think about from a liability point of view if they gave the ok it fine to and somebody system got messed I can guarantee you somebody at least try to sue for the damage because they said it was ok granted it probably would win in the courts but it would still be unnecessary waste of time and resources.
---
*cries in Engineer*
---
Why am I thinking immediately of Team USA?
---
&gt; ...or...people can NOT panic and blow everything out of proportions based on blind assumptions
---
A great way to avoid this would be if ANet accompanied ban-waves with a statement like this one. Some people are *very* invested in the game, and having sudden bans come out of nowhere, with no explanation, and only people claiming that they got banned for no reason creates exactly the environment for this sort or response from the player base.
---
I mean, if the cops suddenly showed up around town, and arrested a bunch of people, and locked them up, and no-one in government would say *anything* about it, people would worry. A lot. We expect to be told *something* when punitive action is taken against a lot of people for no obvious reason, and if we aren't told things, we start to worry if we are next.
---
I find it weird that you think  that.
---
Off the top of my head only herald rev and DH Guard don't use their elite weapons in a meta build.
---
[Well, its monday =) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dka7hc/megathread_october_2019_ban_wave/f4lgjva/)
---
Thanks for all the advice! 
---
Recently I decided that I like challenging myself in video games, so I’m also trying to purposely play the most difficult classes as well. Right now I’ve got a firebrand guard with condi dps build, I’ve got a deadeye thief with a power dps build, so I’m looking to expand my arsenal. Apart from tanking, I heard that the weaver is the most difficult class to master due to the rotations and ability to attune two elements at once, and holosmith is kinda complex too. 
---
I’m kind of all over the place, I wanna dip my toe in everything. 
---
Right now I’ve got 2 free slots, after those two I mentioned I’ve got a level 63 engineer so far. 
---
I think I’ll look into reaper and chrono as my final two. I hear they perform pretty well in terms of unkillability if that’s even a word.
---
But you look on the spellbreaker warrior build and it doesn't use dual dagger, only a dagger in the off-hand.
---
Well it's really weird to think about that. Is that really important?  
---
And if you want to have the elite weaps to be used in meta builds 2 things they have to do :  
---
- balance weapons
---
- balance trait-line (some need a complete rework)
---
Doesn't require any bloodstone dust to create the food itself.
---
* Claims the subreddit is indifferent to their important issues.
---
* Also has a post about said important issue with 900 upvotes and 3 awards, disproving the prior point.
---
This is a little baffling.
---
I suppose it I never thought of it, compared to the amount of weapons available to a class.
---
Why would it be considered cheating? You are using what Guild Wars 2 already provides you. If they didn't want you to know the recipes they wouldn't list them on their own wiki.
---
WvW is going to be strongly guild-based soon™ anyway.
---
Yep, and even that is questionable.
---
I do wish they made some of the weapons more useful though...I’ve never so much as even EQUIPPED a longbow on dragonhunter because it’s 1000% useless in every mode.
---
ive actually been enjoying pvp very much nowadays
---
Are the daggers that crap?
---
&gt;worthless titles
---
Or parts for a legendary perhaps
---
thanks, now i just need to find a way to macro my stuff.
---
I played it because I wanted to, efficiency be damned.
---
Did you bought the dlcs or do u play the basic game?
---
Fine, 2.5 :-P 
---
Mainhand dagger is good in PvP though.
---
Judge by # of posts on reddit per day/week....
---
Well there's your problem. Almost every elite spec makes use out of their weapons somewhere. Deadeye has a really high damage build that uses rifle, compared to the dagger build which is the worst of the viable power builds. Spellbreaker is a very PvP focused build, and dagger is as well, a very PvP focused weapon. Spellbreaker are pretty shit in PvE, but are great in PvP. Dagger offers utility that you just don't need in PvE. So you not caring about an entire part of the game is why you won't see Spellbreaker use their weapon. Same goes for scrapper as well, on all points for spellbreaker. And kinda same for Dragonhunter.
---
Other than... Basically everyone uses the weapon that opens up to them. The elite specs are more than just weapons though. With dagger DE, for example, you get a trait line that gives a flat damage bonus, paired with another damage bonus from having boons, extra power and precision, and just adds more damage to backstab. It's objectively better than something like trickery that only adds damage when you use initiative. The elites also add new utility skills. Thief is lacking in skills that just do damage(at least for power builds), so things like shadow flare can be a big spike in damage compared to what would otherwise be a core build. The same is true for other classes as well.
---
The game isn't just raids. Just because something isn't most viable there, doesn't mean it doesn't work well, or isn't meta in other content. Every class has a viable build that uses their elite spec weapon somewhere.
---
60ish? 
---
60.
---
You said earlier in your first response that players were not banned for ArcDPS. That seems like more?
---
It feels really unnerving to now hear that it's all to use at your own risk. Plugins like d912, arcdps, and radial mount menu are really great improvements to the game. 
---
We have no official statement on ArcDPS templates being expressly forbidden directly from Anet. All we have is the statement from back when they were given tenuous approval. Players just want some peace of mind that they can keep using these QoL tools where no official solution has been added. 
---
All of my raids/fractals since Delta disabled his templates have come with the moaning of templates not being available. Some players are choosing the risk of the modified .dll because they genuinely would rather risk a ban than play without templates and I think it's likely that attitude will persist once the official templates launch as they are very limited by comparison.
---
Go play WvW. It might not be the absolute best build, but longbow can fuck up single targets pretty good.
---
I'm not sure if it's just random luck or if there's an underlying correlation, but the overwhelming majority of the lab groups I've found in that section have had kind, but rather lousy commanders leading them. 
---
Squads in the top category are the usual mix, but in the festivals section, they've just been slow, or retracing their steps...or saying in the lfg that they're skipping bosses, yet they stop for them every time...and I've encountered those kinds of groups probably 80%+ of the time in that festivals group.
---
As much as I'm a fan of having a separate group for them, thus far, in my experience it's only served to separate the Bush League.
---
Pro-tip: Use the action camera.
---
They have list of actions that are okay to do within the game. So as long as addon stays within this list of allowed actions, should be fine.
---
The problem is that for regular user, it can be hard to identify full scale of actions that addon is doing, one has to trust the author.
---
If you're tallying accounts on reddit, you're probably counting ones who were forgotten 5 years ago. Some people are just here to stir the pot, if only because it's so easy.
---
Every year, that little girl crushes my dreams
---
&gt;Anet actually can monetize so much QoL stuff IF they actually can do cool PR. Something that ignites (vague) fire in Player's Soul.
---
I don't believe QoL like this should be monetized, personally. However, what you say is true. As a GW fan from the beginning of GW1, having taken part in dumping tons of money into GW2, I'm refusing to spend a single penny in this game again until ANet shows that they care about the players at all. There is no future for GW2 right now, or at least nothing that ANet is confident enough to tell us about so they're staying silent.
---
I honestly would have preferred if the game's death was quick instead of this super super slow burn.
---
Here’s the issue with this:
---
ArenaNet say that they don’t know how the rumour started that it was ArcDPS. Here’s how the rumour started: you gave generic, useless error messages for those that were banned. How about explicitly stating on the log in page *why* a user was banned? Without that, you leave room for rumours and screw yourselves over. 
---
Secondly, they say the fact that people who claimed never to have used ArcDPS got banned so that should have tipped off the public that the ban wasn’t for ArcDPS. Lol, as if ArenaNet haven’t had false positives plenty of times in the past.
---
Be more public about why there were bans, and do it the second you swing the ban hammer. Why wait a few days? Who does that help?
---
Disable double-tap to dodge as well
---
Just press 1
---
The fault is on ArenaNet for having useless communication, not with the subreddit. There would be no room for speculation if a statement had been made instantly. Don’t blame us.
---
Nah this sub has been like this for almost as long as I can remember - definitely more than 5 years
---
It just feels like more now because these controversies are current/fresh
---
It’s funny because: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dka7hc/comment/f4lgjva
---
You’ve obviously never played an MMO if you don’t think high level PvE players pay PvP players to boost them in PvP.  It literally happens in every single MMO when there’s something that can’t be gotten by a time-sink alone.
---
It's simple, when in doubt, don't.
---
Love mainhand dagger in WvW roaming as well. I run Mace-Axe, Dagger-Shield and its lovely.
---
Congratulations to Snowcrows for also dominating the pvp scene, i guess....
---
You all are just embarrassed that you were wrong.
---
It was a weekend, dude. He answered the "controversy" at 9am Monday morning.
---
Should the "lazy fucker" be forced to clock in all weekend just to pacify an increasingly hyperbolic subreddit? Obviously not.
---
It literally happens every time there is a ban wave/thread. Buncha crybabies and random posters who don't even play anymore stirring up shit in the subreddit because they either hate the game, anet, or like to start trouble for lolz.
---
Sweden has life sentences, it’s a life sentence until pardoned rather than until death, which is the only difference from the U.S.
---
(X)
---
There have been a lot of people on this subreddit that are here just to fan flames.
---
&gt;20 people bitter for being banned for unrelated reasons seizing a bandwagon to feel vindicated?
---
I just find it very unlikely
---
I get what you are saying but there's so many different levels of stuff to do that it's more like paying for an expansion early then it is pay to win. PvP in low sec and wormhole space doesn't even allow titans. I think the game has a lot of other problems and I understand why vets hate the skill injectors, but in my opinion its less of a problem that people make it out to be. At least now (I don't know how it used to be.)
---
Anyway, have a good one.
---
We have already been waiting two years for that. I won't keep my hopes up. At this stage chances are a lot higher that the game will pull a WildStar. Wait for that earnings report in two weeks time...
---
It's been a bit rediculous since the bans for exploiting the ability to turn karma into gold using the hoelbrak npc just after release.
---
Lmao. It's not your ex-wife dude, it's a company. Play their game or don't.
---
because it wasnt so scenic anymore
---
&gt; That's...really dumb. I'm sure they ban a lot of people, you want them to give notification every time so you know whether or not to panic rage?
---
Maybe not, but they could have given a more detailed error message on the log in page for those banned, explaining exactly why they were banned. That has the same effect no? 
---
&gt; Come on. This only happened because someone made an assumption and posted a thread about it on the weekend, instead of contacting support about why they were banned like they should have. The hive mind took off from there. Just don't make threads before contacting support if you think you were unfairly banned, it's not hard.
---
The assumption was always going to be made in this climate. Their PR people should know this. Do you think ArenaNet are blissfully unaware how unhappy their player base is right now? Are they so out of touch that they think banning a load of people straight after ArcDPS was changed without explaining why would not cause public rumours? 
---
&gt; You're not entitled to your rage and knee jerk reactions.
---
This is nothing to do with entitlement. It’s about having a PR team that understand and is close enough to their player base that they can predict and avoid situations. The public will always be a ragey hive mind when they’re angry. Why give them something to jump on?
---
We live in a society
---
how often should they tell you to use add-ons at your own risk?
---
&gt;"...to about five dozen..."
---
Could be more, or less.
---
Sorry for being pendantic
---
Restoring items/characters can be weird. One time I requested a character being restored (weekly key character I forgot to remove gear from) and they had it back the next day. Some other time I deleted an item by accident and it took 3 weeks to restore that single item.
---
How about they don’t ban on a Friday night? It’s in their best interest not to.
---
Wow you are a rollercoaster.
---
I'll try to respond to this in order:
---
Account sharing has always been against the ToS. The message these players received was more or less a way to force them to contact support to change the password and to notify them of the reason they got banned. Sure, we can't actually verify the claim of either side here, but I'd wager it's safe to interpret the company's official response as the truth as they could ultimately just ban you for any reason at all and it wouldn't make much difference for their daily operations. Companies tend not to do that with their services as they want to retain trust with people spending money on those services.
---
If there were in fact 60 people sharing an account in a physical space, by using the same VPN, by being on the same main internet connection, or whatever other excuse you can think of -- it's more likely the MAC address was constant to show that one physical machine was logging on to all of these. If your roommate/sibling was logging in from the same PC, this is probably a good time to talk to them about how hacks/cheats in an online game generally come with consequences. Otherwise, just don't share your account.
---
Their stance on AHK and other macro software is that as long as it's not playing the game for you, you're fine. Just don't try to code your full DPS rotation into a sequence for one button hit. 
---
And lastly, for your most ridiculous hypothetical: if you do nothing about cheaters in your game, they begin to run rampant. You're trying to sell the idea that because these cheaters are willing to pay for cheats that must also mean they're whales paying for more in GW2, but that's a bit of a stretch. Unless this is more like a confession from you?
---
***
---
Every online account, service, or game you take part in comes with the relationship they can end at any time. If you feel like you can't trust that company, especially in a game with so much collection and accumulation, then yeah don't spend money and maybe look for a company with a game you feel like you can trust.
---
Sorry math is hard. Can you explain in candy corn?
---
I’m not wrong? My annoyance with ArenaNet is with their disallowing of the software. The supposed bans were a symptom of the problem that they still have...
---
I have no idea why people are apologising for ArenaNet for having poor player communication. This is on them.
---
It depends on what you're getting a response for. Item restoration most likely gets routed to a different team than account management issues or ban appeals.  As a rule is it stops you from playing outright they seem to be quicker at investigating.
---
The richest irony for all the furious people in this thread.
---
TBF, they were trying to be more pedantic.
---
I believe their original post said that arcDPS was not the reason this time for the bans.
---
Not that its ok to use.
---
The only time i've personally heard it be specifically be permitted was years ago.

Elite specs SHOULD have viable builds that dont use their new weapon. If they were only worth using if you used the weapon would be terrible design
---
Fuck off u/rude_asura you never have anything substantial to say on this sub anyway.
---
You honestly never know, \*especially\* if the account hasn't been touched in a long time.  
---
This sort of thing happened to my GW1 account. It was untouched for like, a decade. Then one day I decided to reinstall and log in so I could link the Hall of Monuments, and not only did I find out my account had been hacked, but whoever was playing it leveled up some characters and racked in like 12 years worth of birthday gifts. Hey, I'm not complaining - but I was surprised my account, by the way the original email no longer exists in MSN's database, was ever accessed.  
---
Dormant accounts are often the target of hackers and cheaters, because they're less likely to be discovered.
---
Sorry but we can't see shit. Do a proper recording with a software, not your phone.
---
Beautiful. Well done ser
---
P.S. apparently ban wave had nothing to do with arcdps (which i've been using for years) so you can safely use this.
---
Turn off post processing in graphics options
---
aged like milk
---
Which changes exactly *nothing* about my pont. It's a "ban wave" because it was framed as a ban-wave, and ANet said nothing on the topic.
---
If they had made a statement when they banned the guy, or if they had followed up on it way faster, there would have been nothing for anyone to get worked up about.
---
This subreddit is full of idiots and crybabies that throw tantrums over everyfuckingthing. If i was Anet i wouldn't give this place a second glance. Nothing is ever good enough and they demand a statement every week. Exhausting
---
Not panic and jump to conclusions? In THIS economy? I don't think so
---
I cannot imagine doing it without using action cam. That feature was a godsend for jumping puzzles, at least for someone who's used to playing games where the mouse controls the camera at all times.
---
Ah maybe my Equipment gives me the view i have. 
---
My keybinds are: 1-5 on my Mouse (got enough side buttons so i can Play with my thumb)
---
F1-f4 are on 1-4.
---
Heal is on shift.
---
6-0 is on C,V,B and N.
---
And Dodge so on the mouse wheel.
---
Got all i need relativly near together.
---
Dont know this downvote tho. 
---
I played Multiple movement dependent games in which you need Multiple mouse Buttons.
---
Never had a Problem, even before my gaming Equipment. 
---
Only thing i need was remapping the keybinds and get the hang of them.
---
With my new Equipment its far easier but nevertheless its possible and relativ easy to do.
---
You only need to find which keybinds work for you. Maybe search online for some binds?
---
No, no where does it say elite specs MUST use the new weapon
---
&gt;PR people are paid lots of money
---
I wouldn't want even double that to have to deal with that kind of customership.
---
Besides, wages in the game industry are usually sub-average.
---
(If I had to nitpick, devs are not related to PR in any way.)
---
Which he couldn’t have done if his log in page explained why he was banned. The log in page which many banned posted publicly.
---
It is nice, isn't it? It dramatically changed the way I play the game and I enjoy it a ton more. Even if it is still "better" to play with locked camera in PvP and pve and whatnot, I still will just use action cam because it feels much better
---
All clear now, Thank you dak393 - your help is most appreciated!
---
Why are you so eager to give this guy the benefit of the doubt?

So in that case, I will hold with the Halloween Exotic at the bank until I'm 80 and sure which build I want to run. I'm guessing that out of the box full set of Halloween exotic - will be better compared to most blue items I'll find.
---
&gt;Can't blame people for assuming things when no information is given to them and all they can do is connect the dots.
---
Obviously not, because of religious freedom.
---
And so does league of legends and ppl still 1. Didn't provide the screenshot or 2. Photoshop the screenshot
---
&gt; when they say the dhumm fight takes 10 minutes
---
&gt; but your squad wipes ~~after 2~~ during pre event
---
improved your meme!
---
Great info that still doesn't answer my question.
---
Good to see it was a great decision to quit this game.
---
I’m sorry what? I believe he was banned validly. My issue is with how ArenaNet conveyed (or didn’t convey) that information. 
---
They did the right thing in the wrong way, and that gives an angry player base an excuse to side with the banned person, especially as ArenaNet has banned plenty of people wrongly in the past.
---
The developer has said the policy and I doubt what they will say if you keep asking and asking. Use addons at your own risk.
---
Nice work Anet, nice work indeed.
---
hmmm am i thinking of Chinese new year stuff? i thought i saw a thread recently about people maxing MF and going to silverwastes for even more before opening some festival boxes
---
Very true, but if that’s your job, it’s your responsibility.
---
My question is not about addons in particular but whatever
---
You can literally switch the names and it would still be a true statement lmao  
---
A new player will always have shit to do, but this ain't a discussion about new players.   
---
Also the 4 tiers of difficulty were created to be easier because most people couldn't do the raids lmao   
---
You had normal and heroic and they added an easier and even harder version, not that you even touched the harder ones but if you did (doubt it tho) wait till you see how "hard" gw2 raids are ;)
---
What I hope is that with the new chapter focusing on Charr and Norns we get some new customization options as we did with the human in PoF #PrayForNewMakeOverOption
---
At least Riot have attempted to solve the problem.
---
yeah the envelopes from Lunar New Year are affected by mf
---
I only play fighter in pvp because out of all the jobs he is the strongest. It's literally his specialty.
---
And here's a bit of that "whoever".
---
... guess how long the pre-event takes
---
Just uphold your functionality to those questions. They won't vet specifics.
---
&gt;In mine and many other people's opinion, ArenaNet are being unethical idiots.
---
Seems like you were the "dumb public" yesterday when you were ranting and raving about how evil Anet was for banning someone for using "harmless software." And it seems that now you're super defensive because you were wrong about the issue, and you have to blame someone else rather than accept that you directly contributed to the blind mob hate with your faux-intellectualism.
---
Why do you think you have the right to know why a single person was banned?
---
Oh so the arc template dll is safe? nice
---
Wow that's a good read. Funny how ANet responded to it though...
---
*cough* Home instance node *cough*
---
[–]Dornsinger 47 points 2 hours ago 
---
Even ANet refers to it as Third-Party Software. So thanks for being a jerk for no reason.
---
He probably was told. Why should the player base be made privy to that?
---
&gt; Nothing bad comes from sharing your account unless someone uses your account to cheat.
---
Do you even realize that you literally just contradicted yourself?...or is that understanding beyond you?
---
If you're talking about the GW2 client, then Photoshop.  It's text on a mostly plain background.  Slightly harder than editing the message you'd get logging into your account on the site, yes, but not impossible - especially for someone already attempting to spread damaging rumors.
---
You would think so, but I know too many skill clickers who turn with keyboard only.
---
What evidence of Anet's reason to ban was there?
---
None.
---
Therefore the first info we got about a modified version of Arc's templates was the lead everyone followed.
---
If Anet would've made a statement right off the bat, that wouldn't have happened.
---
He means why should YOU know why someone got banned.
---
Answer is, you aren’t owed that at all. Stop blaming anet for something the community did completely on its own.
---
He means why should YOU know why someone else got banned.
---
Math.. this guy does the math
---
Yo.  Read my post again.
---
Wish they would add a 2v2 no objectives arena
---
Do you understand what a contradiction is? Nothing is inherently bad or bannable about account sharing. The bannable offense is the cheating.
---
Do you have 2 factor authentication on you accounts? Could be that some accessed it without your knowledge
---
&gt; you admitted to not knowing
---
Where? Nice deflection, btw
---
I quoted it friend.
---
I would be curious as to the kind of masochist who can do angry social media management and is still willing to work for sub-average fees.
---
Maybe they can't find any?
---
(Customers have responsibilities too, respect toward fellow human beings being the first.)
---
He was probably using cheating programs to sell achievements.
---
All too often the difference between banning them already and forgetting about them again in the next call of urgency.
---
I did, don't see anywhere what evidence you got about Anet's real reason for banning people.
---
And that's an admission... how? Are you saying law and ethics are completely unrelated? Are you... "admitting" it?? 
---
And to what end are you whining about the ethics of a company if you expect no change from it? Do you actually have nothing better to do? I mean, I'd believe that.
---
You don't need to know the reason why something happened to not jump to a conclusion that existing evidence already rules out.
---
I completely agree with your line of thinking here. This is the problem. Clearly ArenaNet isn’t paying enough in PR to deal with this situations.
---
&gt; (Customers have responsibilities too, respect toward fellow human beings being the first.)
---
It’s just not going to happen when the customers are angry. They were angry before this and quite rightly. Then this happens and they channel their anger. Easily done. I did it myself.
---
Use it at your own risk as the Anet response in the post above said.
---
&gt; He means why should YOU know why someone else got banned.
---
Firstly, ArenaNet JUST ANNOUNCED why someone else got banned. So maybe we are owed that? 
---
Secondly, those that got banned shared their screenshots willingly. If the message was different, either they wouldn’t have shared the image (so less likely to be believed), they would have shared it (and would have immediately been called out for the reason) or they would have faked it (and most likely have been shown how their image was faked).
---
Or you just use a tome of knowledge / lvl boost from a shared inventory slot, open map and use the waypoint right next to you.
---
The conclusion people drew was that the reason was the modified Arc, because all the info we had was someone banned while using it.
---
Which goes back to my point, that false assumption spread as fact because Anet's lack of statement.
---
&gt; He probably was told.
---
Doubt. 
---
&gt; Why should the player base be made privy to that?
---
I don’t know. Ask ArenaNet that shared this information in this very post.
---
It’s not impossible, but it’s easier to make a mistake than to do it perfectly. And then you need every single person who shared their screenshot to all perfectly fake their screenshot before it starts to unravel.
---
"an official in a government department, in particular one perceived as being concerned with procedural correctness at the expense of people's needs." when did Anet become part of the US government. Do you know how tempted I am to say oh typical Boris hating on Bureaucrats.
---
Yes and no clue
---
Or they could mark their account for banning in 2 days.
---
Ban date = 21/10/2019 in their SQL server. They could have done that Friday.
---
Does this count as activity for the AFK timer?
---
Also this sounds like either the rates were changed or wiki's data is not accurate because a month of boost at the wiki rate would have required 240 stacks but that would have required 30 slot bags in 8 bag slots and I think those came after the change to the time limit.
---
&gt;all the info we had was someone banned while using
---
We had plenty of people claiming to have been banned while using the clean version or no version at all.  From that, it follows that either A) they were lying (not unthinkable, admittedly), B) the bans weren't about Arcdps, or C) only some of the bans were about Arcdps.  If you're willing to allow that potentially some of the bans in the wave had nothing to do with Arcdps, it's not exactly a stretch to consider that maybe none of them did.
---
&gt; And that's an admission... how? Are you saying law and ethics are completely unrelated? Are you... "admitting" it??
---
You can’t legally pursue someone for not breaking the law. What are you taking them to court for lol? 
---
&gt; And to what end are you whining about the ethics of a company if you expect no change from it? Do you actually have nothing better to do? I mean, I'd believe that.
---
Another ad hominem. Nice. Sorry for having intellectual discussions with sources. My bad.
---
They ANNOUNCED it because people were having a shit fit over nothing. You aren’t owed anything, they just wanted to put an end to the collective temper tantrum, because quite honestly it was pathetic. 
---
Also you should know by now to always second guess someone who’s claiming to have been wrongly banned. Yes, it happens, but in the vast majority of cases they’re lying through their asses and are just salty about being caught doing things they shouldn’t have. 
---
You aren’t owed an investigation from arenanet. The only argument you could make is that the people who got banned deserved an explanation. A random unrelated person (you) isn’t owed access to that information. Stop feeling so damn entitled. And stop blaming them for jumping to conclusions and ending up being wrong.
---
We’re not owed it, but it’s in ArenaNet’s best interest to proactively stop the public raging dude... is it really that difficult to understand?
---
Yup. /u/BorisMeateater is off their rocker and completely unable to concede the argument when they're clearly in the wrong.
---
You dont need to use gender neutral terms when mentioning me. I have peepee.
---
Wasn't Gaile supposed to be a community manager yet she didn't communicate much, except for chastising disenting opinions on the forums and answering once in a while to fluffy questions?
---
Honestly, I can see why it wouldn't even occur to them to do that (or even why they would choose not to, despite that). It probably didn't even occur to them that basic banning practices within explicit guidelines would ever be called into question. It sounds like the "build templates" outcry was completely manufactured. It's not arenanet's fault that we just assumed it was true. It's probably not a concern they had going forward with it. I don't really expect them to give us a heads up everytime they ban someone
---
Pretty much. I assume he was boosting the accounts using hacks, while the account owner had no clue at what was going on. I mean, who the fuck would share their own accounts to someone they probably don't even know ? Heck, I don't even share my account with my family or friends.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted here. This is absolutely right. Communication is key. I have no idea why they dished out this ban wave on the weekend when there aren't any ArenaNet devs / support team members able to be able to deal with any ripples caused.
---
And people have every right to be sceptical of ban waves, considering at least one past ban wave has been [questionable to say the least](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8c2j0y/a_technical_analysis_of_the_spyware_arena_used/). This happened around the time the modified DLL of build templates was thrown around, and the generic "tampering with the game" error message very much applied to that particular action. The first reaction from many of the players was to assume that this tampered DLL was what caused the ban, especially since various of the targeted players were also people that used this tampered DLL.
---
Either way, I'm happy this isn't the case and that Dornsinger did let us know what the real deal was.
---
Keep telling yourself that.
---
&gt; That way manipulating the data like that would be nearly impossible.
---
always do your own research!
---
Hey, just FYI, your site doesn't load with https.  It'll load with http, though.  When attempting to navigate to it with https in Chrome I get the error:
---
"This site can’t provide a secure connectiongw2mb.com sent an invalid response.
---
ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR"
---
Just standard http seems to work, though.  http://gw2mb.com/
---
Great to see support for Blish HUD, though!  :)
---
As someone who worked as game admin in another MMORPG I find it very believable. You would be surprised how much account sharing there is in guilds between "friends". It wasn't something unusual to be able to link main hacker account to dozens of others in which many were just standard innocent players that trusted wrong person.
---
  
---
Also as others mentioned sharing your account and paying to some hackers so he gets something done that cannot be bought for in-game currency eg. achievements, mission progress, pvp ranks etc. is VERY popular among elites. What is also suprising is that I often encountered players who shared their accounts to hacker then tried to make excuses like "I knew he was cheating but it wasn't me playing" - seriously it was mind blowing how many times someone tried to make his way out of ban saying it.
---
I haven't read that yet (too long didn't read). Just quickly commented about math. Thank you for your information!
---
So the correct answer is 59,9.
---
You'll get the mail after daily reset, yes.
---
I was definitely being pedantic about the wording of the person I replied to. They should have quoted the developer and not used specific and then unspecific. 
---
But it's hilarious that there are over 40 people that downvote that stuff.
---
Snowcrow builds are only a small portion of the game. They're balanced around PvP and WvW more often since there's more depth. Utility matters a lot less in PvE then it does against players, so really Snowcrow builds just care about highest DPS weapons/traits and boon sharing.
---
True, Hammer Scrapper is not listed as meta on either of the meta sites. Very much playable with damage comparing to a Daredevil though. I meant, Healing Scrapper on Raids though, only seen it on River of Souls, if you refer to SC they actually recommend hammer.
---
&gt;You will want to bring a Hammer on this encounter for the additional lightning field from...
---
But, like you said Pistol / Shield is what is META.
---
Okay thanks for answering!
---
Oh, so, I see not only do you not understand your own contradiction, but you're not even aware of the other facets of the situation.
---
Let me enlighten you: [9b](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-user-agreement/).
---
What was the cheaters name? Im curious if its who i think it is.
---
Not everyone has the cash for that, but ANet has all the actual info.
---
It's only fair to put the burden on them.
---
Even something like an API end for drop tables listing every creature and container and the drop tables linked to it, with the drop chances of each entry in each drop table would be neat.
---
It would not be in-game, but it'll allow community sites to add drop rates to their item databases.
---
The public will always rage. It’s a given. They’re not innocent but neither is ArenaNet for ignoring the inevitable. They’re just as worthy of blame for this situation.
---
I have to manually enter after doing the openings. Automating that would be too much effort for too little gain, but is possible by using the API.
---
They can't release a statement for every person that gets banned. 60 accounts hardly counts as a "ban wave". A "ban wave" is at least hundreds. This is like a ban ripple. reddit blew this out of proportion.
---
&gt; You can't hide behind some ethics debate like you were giving a lecture lmao
---
Lol. The entire discussion was about ethics. Who’s hiding?
---
The big brain move is to have people remote into your account through teamviewer/anydesk and remotely do it for you.
---
Don't bother man. This guy was literally part of the public mob yesterday, and now he's trying to backpedal his idiotic behavior like it's Anet's fault because Anet dressed a certain way.
---
It's absurd.
---
Which taco pack has the clock tower JP?
---
How bad would the latency be in that case? Seems hard to do a JP at any delay over half a second long.
---
I can accept that. But they should have jumped on it a bit sooner.
---
I mean, if he's got multiple GW2 accounts, it's only sensible to assume that he's able to sockpuppet well enough that he could probably have blown it out of proportion all by himself.
---
Your theory stated people were getting automatically banned because of templates, which was false and fed into the hysteria.
---
This is misleading. Only her GW1 account was taken over because she had 2FA on her GW2 account.
---
They had a chance to fix it all with HoT and then the bunker meta happened..
---
but they can only accuse the accounts of what their servers show. they know whats going on, we know whats going on, but they can only ban for things proven beyond a doubt.
---
It's alright when I've used it to access my own pc. Definitely not helpful, but I can manage. Maybe 0.25-0.5s?
---
Could just put your webcam on another computer to look at you surfing reddit while a little girl finishes your JP for you.
---
Irrelevant
---
Yes, you are.
---
:((
---
but what about the guy who's buddy hadnt played since april, who attempted to log in for halloween but was banned? did he too use the pvp booster in april? 
---
have anet let the pvp cheater go that long?
---
What exactly about it is good for WvW? The exp boost?
---
Full disclosure: I only hated on the current marketing for build templates regardless of any relation to the ARC template usage. 
---
The methods used by GW1 were so consumer friendly and that game was just as B2P as GW2. The only difference is that microtransactions were in their infancy then and it was very "testing the waters" back then.
---
I shall not digress further.
---
Of course PR people can help with these situations. 
---
THAT DOESNT MEAN THE BLAME IS ON THEM. 
---
That’s my problem with your entire ranting. Who you decided to blame for this whole crap. If all you said was that the PR team could have prevented this, then I could agree, but you’re pushing the idea that anet was completely at fault so hard that you’re just looking salty that you ended up being wrong.
---
Anyone with half a damn brain knows to always doubt complaints of wrongful bans. There will never be a day where I will blame the company when people start creating witch hunts out of spite. Especially for something as stupid as a ban wave. 
---
I’m done listening to your delusions now. Have fun throwing fits because I know you aren’t done hating on the company.
---
&gt; This shows: You can behave like shit as long as you mobilize enough people to defend you and jump on the boycott train. That's all.
---
You've successfully identified Trump's campaign strategy.
---
Most top of top players are against soloq.   
---
Even some pro players like Helseth left when duoq was removed(it wasn't the only reason or even the most important one but it was the final nail in the coffin).   
---
This isn't a truly competitive game currently and while I and many different people enjoy the combat it's just not good for it.   
---
Also there are classes which are heavily favorited in soloq and the game isn't balanced around them but around 5 person teams(this is why the main competitive mode is tournaments).  
---
Maybe in Grouch era it could have made more sense but now it would be just literally killing the game because some players think the player elo is the most important measure while basically any of top players will say you that it's not.  
---
Also the top players ranking in EU(I have no idea what the situation is in US) was basically the same when there was soloq and duoq.
---
I expect Blizzard to already be working on this technology.
---
Just putting this out there, a good leader stays at a slow enough pace for most people to keep up. One squad I was in tag was moving forward so fast that only like three people including myself could keep up with. Everyone else fell so far behind that mobs I tagged weren't even being killed.
---
Pro-tip: pay someone else to do it for you on your account. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Buying PvP boosting service. Pay gold, share login, booster sometimes use hacks to get easier wins unbeknownst to the account owner. Half a year later everyone that shared login with the booster gets slapped with a ban. According to Dornsinger, they banned any accounts the booster had access to, regardless of whether the account itself used the hack or not.
---
Of course, that's literally what it's meant to do. Just that I'd rather not use it for when I really need the numbers to be correct as that thing relies on the API which can sometimes rarely go wild. And of course the site itself too. That probably won't happen, but it could happen, so I'd rather be safe than sorry.
---
if you're looking from validation from me you won't find it
---
you said it in a pretty dumb way that was condescending and in the middle of a pitchfork rally
---
&gt; If you want to see how absurd things get when you leave your community in charge of determining who broke what rules, look at Riot during season 1-3 of LoL
---
I was part of the tribunal.
---
I’m not saying Riot is perfect. I’m saying they at least provide more information. Jagex also deals with this better.
---
Sadly people do this all the time though, sharing with strangers at the promise of boosted rank or title. It's common across nearly all PvP style games that hold a ranking system, and the worst part is they pay the guy to do it in most cases.
---
If there's anything Anet absolutely without a doubt does better than any other MMO or online RPG, it's interesting combat and the complete inability to take advantage of their strengths. I'm always surprised when I see a developer be so ridiculously competent yet inept at the same time.
---
Then don't watch it.
---
They kept the grablveyard PvP map closed after first time for years and reopened it last year. Yeah!
---
Maybe they bring some old things back.
---
/u/Dornsinger any chance you could take a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dk94lq/anet_irl/f4bt210/) for a second? what do you think of it?
---
Ah yes, a Reddit Intellectual here to lecture me on a definition of a word.
---
Can you take a current photo of it so we can see how it survived the kid?
---
I am not sure it will "never" happen. It's already law in some places of the world, and there are several big name companies that will be requiring all games on their systems do this (Apple, Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo). As far as I know, Microsoft only enforces this on Xbox.
---
I noticed the same. 
---
The people that are ingame are way nicer and indeed have more common sens. 
---
Reddit is the place that made me realise the, We have the nicest community talk is all just bs talk to make the game sound nicer to newer people. It has been showed many times and most of the reddit users here would believe everything a dev or gm say and follow blindly without thinking has also been proven many time. 
---
Me and some other people even got attacked by gw2reddit users when a gm was lying about bans when they were giving away wrongful bans.
---
Two dozen is 1/5 + 1/25 of one stack of candy corn. The given amount is an estimate and not an exact number.
---
It's six different ones.  You need to unlock six Dragonsblood skins, basically.
---
Count me in that bunch. Off and on for 7 years, I can't think of another game that's stuck around that long for me.
---
i take that cancer into the trash bin
---
Unfortunately this side-story was not updated to the in-game day system like the skyscale and the Grandmaster cooking side-stories.
---
You can't just wait a Tyrian day, you have to wait until reset.
---
&gt; You believe the devs who actually know what is going on
---
Like when it took a GDPR data request and whole investigation on the game executable by that one guy for them to finally admit they fucked up? ANet banned a lot of people when their spyware returned hashes of null strings because it couldn't read process name and if not for that guy they'd probably still be banned...
---
They'd have to pay me for me to use that skin.
---
&gt; look at the chances to see how 'very rare' they actually are.
---
And that's what I'm saying, it's deliberately designed to keep that information away from players. The point of listing an item with ~1:35,000 (touch of madness) next to an item with ~1:350,000 (ember infusion) is to fool players into thinking they 'almost' got the infusion.
---
It's the same reason there aren't signs posted in Las Vegas that read "If you play perfectly, you're probably going to lose 20% of your bet per game."
---
It'll stab its horn into the wall and exhibit neck and core strength.
---
Same.  I’ve burned out a few times since beta and always came back.  No MMO is perfect for everyone, but GW2 is better than everything else I’ve tried overall IMO
---
PoF is entirely level 80 content so I would wait until reaching 80 before buying it. It makes levelling more fun with mounts but you have to reach 80 at least once before you can unlock them so you are not missing out on anything by waiting since you are just starting.
---
As a DH you have a whole traitline dedicated to radiating big dick energy
---
You were looking for an explanation. As I said, I know nothing about your situation. You only mentioned modified game files just now as far as I see, so that very well may be it, too. Unless you got personal confirmation I'm pretty sure it's a little difficult to know what it is for certain, as far as I know. I don't recall the messages about being banned that showed up for players included reasons, at least.
---
It doesn't matter how many others do it too, anyways. It's still against ToS and grounds for ANet taking action if they so choose.
---
Perfect response! Thank you very much for this!
---
"Dishonour" odd that we got the British spelling on this one
---
If ArenaNet wanted to cover up banning people for using hacked build templates, this statement seems to be a good way to do it.
---
Seriously, the intersection between people who feel the need to keep using build templates, and people who want to cheat in PvP, is very small, if not zero. So, why was it that the largest group of people banned were using the hacked build templates, hmmm?
---
That's certainly more than just coincidence. "Oh, all of these PvP cheaters also happen to be hardcore raiders." Sure, I believe that... Find me 60 such people.
---
Not sure how you got to TacO from physically swapping the living person at the keyboard, but ok.

Double down, excellent
---
its the best buy right after cooper o matic
---
That wouldn't prevent people from lying about the reason for their ban.
---
simple auto clicker macros are perfectly fine
---
Try using a vpn and see if it still occurs. I've had a similar problem and this actually helped until the core issue got resolved.
---
Will do once I'll decide what I want to do with my Ranger :)

If that helps - she has an rgb keyboard. basically unbeatable.
---
0
---
that was only one player there are still other ones who also got perma and still no info about any specifics
---
Do you know what was the core issue?
---
And I'll try one out
---
you need to use much more then just 1-2 stacks to get any worthwhile data if you want to compare PvE vs WvW
---
This will probably get ignored but I'm interested how this rumor got so big. I find it fascinating.
---
Seems like it started with a simple "confirmation question" of a discord post.
---
Then apologists come along and write yeah, it's what you get when you use 3rd party tools, huge upvotes. Some voice their concern and it's the usual +/- comment chain dependent on which echo chamber is served in the thread. /u/Cynatix and /u/Twintale confirmed their ban. 2 people? Are you fucking kidding me. What are 406 upvotes and 325 comments doing in [https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dk7rrv/people\_perma\_banned\_for\_using\_arcdps/](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dk7rrv/people_perma_banned_for_using_arcdps/)
---
This is next-level stupidity in all its glory.
---
It's kind of funny, because I'm unsubscribed from this subreddit. Too much fucking drama but today I went, well, what's going on in the GW2 subreddit? Oh, Anet is banning people for arcdps templates. Well, that's kind of shitty, let's tell a friend about it.
---
This is how fake news are started and I have to say, I get too many on reddit. It's kind of disgusting. Guess I have to limit my subreddits to cat images or smth.
---
Bye again /r/Guildwars2
---
Or they could lie and not post a screenshot. I don't see screenshots in any of the trending posts on the front page. See any screenshots here?

Nonono, you're supposed to shut up and bootlick now. Get out of here with your doubt and reason.
---
who said u would make 1 month in 1 night tho
---
Been playing ffxiv sice they got disabled. This game has no future.
---
for better chance of getting more than 1 herb per node?
---
If this was about cheating in PvP, why were people getting ban messages about modifying game files?
---
Yeah, I don't have any reason to believe arenanet given their track record but the botlickers have already set the narrative and will continue pretending there's nothing wrong with the way the game is ran until it dies.
---
Highly doubt the drop rates from ToT bags are somewhat volatile however they do change when new items are being added to the loot table.
---
Looks amazing.
---
That sounds extremely awful. Very sorry you have had to deal with that!
---
I'm curious, what would be your desired system to combat that? Are there other games that have a successful system?
---
Usually before, gotta make sure I have time to tear out a tooth as an offering to appease the jumping puzzle god.
---
it is the hype train, why would it go anywhere?
---
Thank you for your sacrifice so that others may jump
---
Nobody provided any evidence that they were banned for using arcdps templates. Many, however, believed this to be true...
---
I was checking that last night. If I run GW2 TACO, there is no limit on my FPS. I think this falls under the "no FPS limit while unfocused" and would be a great feature.
---
The way he's writing his posts it all sounds very shady to me and ridden with guilt.
---
Conquest was a mistake. With the kind of gameplay GW2 has, a good old Unreal/Quake-like deathmatch game mode would have been great.
---
Objective-based PvP game modes are still nice, but they should have been designed for 10v10 instead of 5v5, ala battlegrounds in other MMOs.
---
&gt;I feel that a company with a good PR department would do that?
---
Would do what?  Publicly announce "Hey we're banning a couple of people using keys like 'ICRA-CKED-THIS-LOOL-A788'"?  (Thats not hyperbole.  The blacklisted keys in this instance were old-format: literally almost all real words, usually profanity, with a valid checksum) Because that's silly and just doesn't make sense.  They aren't going to turn into paying customers and this was not a one-time thing, we blacklisted keys constantly as they showed up on crack web pages and torrent sites.  There would have dozens of such notifications a month. So do we just permanently put a big yellow banner at the top of our homepage "Hey we're being pirated, stop that!" and hope they see it?  List it over and over again in the site news?  We obviously don't have contact information for these people so anything we put out has to be public and visible and means we'll have to deal with the hundreds of priority support calls from legitimate customers who are making sure they aren't affected by the ban.
---
When those people logged in that morning, they got an error message that told them exactly what was wrong, "Your registration key is invalid, please contact X to purchase a license".  They STILL called support, who had to tell them their obvious bogus key was bogus.  And they STILL went onto the forums, framed their story to sound like they'd been wronged, and claimed innocence.  The only difference being that this time there was an easy, exploitable coincidence among those banned.  Do you genuinely think a warning of any form in this case would have helped?  It literally just changes their post from "I was unfairly banned" to "They said there was a ban wave and I was unfairly banned".
---
We dealt with grey-market keys ALL THE TIME and as long as they were proactive in giving us all the information WE needed to go after the seller, they'd get a full, valid license key.  That wasn't the case in the above incident and it wasn't the case in A.Net's ban wave.  These people knew they did something wrong and instead of saying "Oh darn, I got caught" they started a furor with a convenient scapegoat.
---
I know what you're gunning for here, and I don't think it's A.Net's responsibility to notify us every 2 days when they ban another cheater.  I also don't think it would have done much help here.  These people knew what they did was wrong and they used a vague screenshot of the ban to shift blame onto Arc templates and raise hell.
---
When life gives you lemons...
---
Thank you very much for giving ArenaNet's response to recent events.
---
As you know, there were many who were very shocked by the rumors. (Myself included.)
---
I was banned for the Zaishen Key collusion in 2009.  T\_T  Please to unban me
---
You have to purchase the Uninstaller off the Gem Store. 400 Gems under account upgrade section.
---
If only we could still fight him every year. Alas he only attempted two years.
---
I promise I don't mean to come off as a conspiracy theorist, and I am sorry, but I still really don't buy the entirety of this. Why then would you allow something to ruminate? I am glad you are amused by this but the money I used to buy this game and the expansions was not easy to come by on a fixed income, I can't be alone. My entire guild of comprised of disabled 40 to 60+ year olds who barely know what the internet is. It's not funny to us that based on Anet's past track record we have to panic and log in to make sure we are not banned because you cannot provide a general reason for a ban wave. We don't PvP, we don't WvW, most of us don't even know how to run 3rd party applications, and we yet still worry because you have done it to innocent others before. I understand this happens with every MMO, I get that, however- the fact that people are so lightning fast to distrust and concoct conspiracy theories based on coincidences that happened in the same timeframe and past happenstances should indicate Anet's and NCsoft's relationship with the community is responsible for the skepticism. That's just the opinon of an aged noob who doesn't like to throw away money. Alright that's enough reddit for me for the next 5 years, back to my hermit shell.

You need Tier 6 of Journeyman of the Forge.

So  it has to be 6 different weapons.

Ive made a ticket...3rd week of no reply

Your charr has nipples. Isn't that against lore?
---
only if you pay for all my expenses :P (this is a joke anet)
---
Well, you can't spell magnetic without magic..
---
Action camera is how I got to do it first time 2years ago and still do it nowadays with no problems.
---
Since March or So, this Subreddit has been a train wreck filled with shit colliding with a fiesta of clowns.
---
to be fair, when an incident comes out of nowhere, they need time to prepare a PR response. And it was the weekend.
---
You can check your story journal on your character but being able to skip means that you've already done story on that character.
---
Pro-tip: get runes of speed and a sigil of speed. You'll keep up as long as your commander isn't doing the same and playing thief.
---
Remember it only took some one to reverse engineer Spyware to find out ANet was banning people for using certain 3rd Party Programs running in the background last year, so it was a feasible **assumption** based on their track record that they might have had another spyware bot looking for something again (to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if some White Hat comes up with something digging deeper into the update).
---
The game is seven years old. Everything, including every single one of its issues, has been discussed a thousand times over. And while this sub does by now indeed relentlessly criticise everything forever and does not allow for the tiniest bit of positivity to go unchallenged because obviously it's not okay to appreciate one thing while another thing is still an issue, even social media like reddit has limits about ruminating the same things over and over and over again. Give it another week or two and we're back to Anet being a cash grabbing trash tier company that kills its own game and knows nothing about anything.
---
The Hysteria of the Week as well as Arts &amp; Crafts are the only exceptions to this thing. And here the mods put enough effort into their sub to avoid having their sub turn into a "spicy" meme hell were relentlessly shitting on everything is the only content available anymore. So Arts &amp; Crafts it is for the most part.
---
&gt; You did ignore the most important part of my answer though 
---
I didn't. I said that in this case, that wouldn't be effective, and provided an alternate solution.
---
&gt; If you get pulled over going 90 mph with a broken tail light, and your first thought is "Maybe they made green paint on a car illegal and that's why I was pulled over!" then I can't help you. Likewise, if you shared account details or paid someone to rank you in pvp and get banned, then your immediate thought shouldn't be "It was DEFINITELY that addon everyone else uses". 
---
How do you know which offence is the speeding and which is the broken tail light? It's perfectly possible that their PvP cheating hadn't been detected, but their add on had...
---
I volunteered for a casual gaming tournament site. A huge portion of our moderating actions resulted in people lying to make us look bad. Turns out nasty people will lie if it helps them lol.
---
&gt; I'm really not a fan of 1st person platforming; I prefer to see my character
---
i don't think action cam is what you think it is.
---
That's good info, but I'm also playing with some family members who have no salvage-o-matics. Is there a spreadsheet similar to that one that simply gives the options without salvage-o-matics?
---
I very much doubt casual players have more than one build. I doubt most even have more than one character that they regularly play.
---
Reddit this, Reddit that... I agree that this sub has been pretty negative and toxic for a while now, especially with the current outrage culture taking over.
---
Still... There's a reason people are acting this way. If the overall opinion around the game was better, people wouldn't be so quick to assume and judge. The levels of unjust toxicity in this sub mirroring the levels of valid discontent/disappointment isn't a correlation, it's a causation.
---
Not saying it's an excuse; everyone should thrive to be as objective as possible... But people remain people. Especially in group, online anonymity.
---
PS: To the masses in this thread saying this subreddit is a circle-jerk of BS, you're all literally doing the exact same thing in denouncing it. Circle-jerking about the Circle-jerk. Over-generalizing and assuming a group's thoughts and intentions based on what very well may be a vocal minority.
---
Just saying.
---
As we established already ethics are subjective, therefore I'm not commenting on personal opinions.
---
It is however buffling, how some people are angry that other people are making a living by entertaining them. Anet for example since 2012 is selling QoL features in gw2. There is no precedence here. They made two mistakes with templates though - first, they waited too long with them and second, they allowed arc in the first place, making some people feel entitled to things they never should have been allowed to use.
---
the gems spent by a few whales that are leaving over this are peanuts compared to the revenue build templates will generate over time for Anet.
---
So many games, it doesn't surprise me at all when a dev pops in and has to say "no, you didn't get banned for this. You were reported for rage quitting and foul language in 20 games" and then the OP stops posting...
---
&gt; As we established already ethics are subjective, therefore I'm not commenting on personal opinions. 
---
You erroneously established that.
---
They already knew about this far ahead of time and could have said something before or during the banning.
---
You are making typical mistake of casual =/= invested or good player. Just because someone is not a young adult spending most of their university playing games while parents pay their rent, it doesn't mean they don't experiment with builds.
---
The best thing would be if anyone spoke for themselves instead of making general assumption threads like this one, trying to present templates "drama" as universal fact, while it's nothing more like another reddit fart.
---
I did not have to deal with that at least not in an MMO. But i have seen someone else having to deal with it and for her inte ended up with her stop playing the game she loved for so many years because no matter what she could not get away from this person and noone could protect her either. 
---
But in my personal opinion and what i think would have helped her was either confirmation of friend ship or possibillity of blocking a person who do stalk you in a way that you actaully go invisible and don't give location info or dots on the map showing were you are. 
---
In a few other mmo i played they also had the opertion to block the person and all the accounts the person have. Ofc it wont tell what those accounts are you simply blocked one of the characters and that blocked the person and the persons all accounts. Does not disturb the game for anyone but help some of the players who struggle with it.
---
There are by-passes of this too but imo there are a lot of actions that can be taken that do not effect other people playing and dont abuse it but still makes it significantly harder for the stalker to stalk. 
---
A system should never favor the stalker but for some reason in GW2 it does and i never understood that.
---
Am I wrong in thinking that casuals use one build and that's it? I don't see a use case for casuals buying this product.
---
Nah, the movement is way too smooth for that. It decelerates far too gently, and the camera doesn't jerk around even in the slightest, which you'd expect from someone picking up and replacing their mouse so that they could continue moving it in the same direction.
---
Unless you say something more than simple denial, you won't make me change my mind.
---
Its an implication that can be surmised from the general “lol this sub is just a negative circle jerk.”  Comments like those attempt to negate the actually valid criticism that underlies much of the aforementioned “circlejerk”
---
"Video is Unavailable" D:
---
White knight harder. Maybe actually add something meaningful next time
---
Pvp herald used shield back then, because it was played much more defensively than now (before all it's evasion was nerfed). But right now there really is no "meta" build that would make use of shield.
---
I can see them buying this for one simple reason arc never offered - gear slots. Freeing inventory space from multiple sets is a big yes for me and I was praying would make templates together with this feature.
---
I don't want to change your mind. You've proven to me that you're not afraid to be obtuse, so I wont be spending any more time explaining ethics to you.
---
That maybe have been the name of her position but it doesn't seem like she did much with the community.
---
&gt; Their hardcore players (the whales) are the ones funding the game.
---
Whales are almost never what we consider "hardcore players".
---
I think the default for the decoration is to show and he festival events trigger point isn't there to turn it off. It also appears in keg brawl
---
Not to mention your thread will achieve nothing as a nice bonus.
---
I was sleepy when I joined a lab farm squad on my necro, was starting to wonder why my connection suddently pooped itself as 80% of the squad teleported around chaotically.. Then I looked at their classes and cursed out loud: most of them were thieves.
---
I don't think you realise just how casual a casual player is. Multiple sets of gear? I doubt it.
---
Lol this is embarrassing.
---
I did not know this... ffs. Though I use he golem instead of shared slot. Thanks
---
Your problem is that you think as casual and hardcore can only be present as duality, while players play differently. It's a spectrum. Yes, there are some who can only play in queensdale and who can't deal with simple veteran. But you're not going to convince me those people are anything more but a minority.
---
Hardcore players will have bought the base game and both expansions on release and a few extra character slots with real money. That's way closer to a whale than any casual will ever be. I feel that it's fair to count them as whales. They'll be buying any expansion pack that's released in the future (if there is one), at full price too.
---
I love how both you and u/borismeateater were so butthurt after trying to argue against me earlier that you both showed up in this thread just to attempt to ridicule me. Now *that* is embarrassing.
---
Gosh, this may be one of my favorite panels yet.
---
You are the one making this personal now, making yourself look stupid in your own thread.
---
&gt; To the masses in this thread saying this subreddit is a circle-jerk of BS, you're all literally doing the exact same thing in denouncing it. Circle-jerking about the Circle-jerk. Over-generalizing and assuming a group's thoughts and intentions based on what very well may be a vocal minority.
---
Wouldn't that mean you're circlejerking the circlejerkers of the circlejerk?
---
The real numbers are a spectrum, but I can show which ones are above 100 and which are below 1. Casual players will be on the spectrum but below a certain point, and whales will be on the same spectrum but above a certain point.
---
I really don't think it's possible to convince you that any of your opinions are wrong to be honest, so yes I doubt I will convince you.
---
Even just the sigil and one teleport skill should be enough if you don't want to invest that much. I've always farmed this on my mesmer and keep up fine this way. Have been converted to the joys of farming as a Mirage this year.
---
Right. Because both of you definitely found holes in my argument and didn't just come here to insult/be obtuse? ;)
---
Our current link mostly speaks Mandarin from what I understand (during SEA hours). That said, we've had many really good scrims with them being in one squad and us in another. It's cool how *sometimes* even in games like GW2-WvW you can have mostly wordless communication that works well. Not that I prefer or advocate this! I prefer to have comms. Just happy/pleasantly surprised at the unexpected level of synergy we're currently experiencing given the situation. EDIT: Just a note that SEA hours refer to hours around GMT+8
---
&gt; and whales will be on the same spectrum but above a certain point.
---
what do you base your assumption on that whales are above and not below this certain point?
---
&gt; I really don't think it's possible to convince you that any of your opinions are wrong to be honest, so yes I doubt I will convince you.
---
in this sentence you are making an assumption that you are right, while we're both doing nothing more but sharing baseless opinions
---
It would take a lot of work, but there is data to show how many builds competitive players have and for what it's worth the poll on the gw2 forums showing how few (1-2) builds casuals have. To find all the competitive players builds though you'd have to track down every raider and WvWer.
---
One of my raiding guildmates has 20 chrono builds, which at most can probably be trimmed down to 10ish. For Guardians there's easily 6 builds you can actively use, condi FB, Condi quickness FB, power quickness FB, healbrand, DH, rune of thief DH, and probably  1 or 2 more FB builds depending on the raid boss encounter.
---
Oh geez quit with all the naysaying and relax. The game is in a good position after coming out of a great living story season with good future content on the horizon. The game is not dead. It feels like people on Reddit can't see the wood for the trees. 
---
Take a step back, smell the omnomberries and make like a Kodan and chill. Be hyped for Icebrood Saga and spread some love. If you can't get to that place go visit the metal legion for a bit of catharsis. Connect with the fact that the Devs are cool human beings and that we're all just trying to enjoy immersing ourselves in the world of Tyria together.
---
True. Hence the reason I said “related to.”  I didn’t mean to imply that it’s not a “partial” responsibility. Obviously there are issues on both sides. I dislike the idea that the community is entirely at fault though, which is why I mentioned the other major issue which is the fact that community unrest is related to how Anet has been doing as a company. I mean, if the game was perfect there would be considerably less unrest than there is currently, so I think it’s bad to absolve Anet of all blame or forget that they have a direct impact on how the community feels
---
Remember mounts?
---
It was all "No mounts, no mounts", then the very same people against mounts rode a springer while screeching like a 3 year old toddler on a pony.
---
Did they ever ban for using the third party combat camera after making an official version? I don't recall ever hearing of such.
---
While they'd no doubt want it to die out, unless it becomes a major detriment to sales + Anet's moral integrity falls much further, then I wouldn't really expect bans to be issued.
---
My first thought: cute and fluffy! *in Stitch voice*
---
Really lovely art!
---
There was zero evidence, and that modified Arc lead was all we had, even if it was false.
---
That's why without Anet's word on the situation most assumed it was the reason.
---
I still don't understand what you are disagreeing with...
---
you are the one insulting me in this thread, not the other way around
---
When your team downs greenperson on 1st try but gets stuck at sloth
---
This is one of the reasons I stopped taking those reddit dramas seriously. And I think Anet did as well.
---
If you do the questline it'll give you ten points per racial quest, too.
---
I get where you're coming from. Before quiting I really wanted to still like the game, but raids aside their last piece of original content was HoT. Everything else after that up until when I quit (after PoF) feels like a clone of LS3 maps. They also serialized all event achievements which was the last straw for me. Every piece of content in the game is generic...
---
With that said if the game was in fine state, I don't think a banwave would have made me quit.
---
The thread isn't a general assumption thread. It's a thread pointing specifically to the three IEEE ethics that ArenaNet broke... I'm done replying to you lmao
---
How did you get it for free?
---
Great, thank you. I do think that it would be nice to include a table that would essentially give the salvage-o-matics with accompanying kit equivalencies. For example, I made a little entry like this for my family members who play with me: [https://p153.p0.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/jkuye7GK/Image+2019-10-21+at+5.59.27+PM.png](https://p153.p0.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/jkuye7GK/Image+2019-10-21+at+5.59.27+PM.png)
---
Really? I buy stuff I don't use all the time. Coffee makers that I think I'll use until it becomes too annoying to maintain them or just instant is more convenient. I bought a blender to make smoothies that I loved, for just about a month.   
---
MY sons buy every single WoW that comes out, play it for a month get bored and swear to never buy another one until the next ones come out. They're not kids, they're in their 30s.
---
People who have hobbies and jobs think nothing of spending some bucks on a game. These are the same people trained by cell phone games.  It's not an ideal situation, it's the changing world. Tell me, do you think more people spend money on games like Guild Wars 2 or games like Farmville?  Which group is more casual. People have been being trained that spending money is part of playing games for years and years now. The more casual you are, the more true that is. 
---
Older/harder core players are more likely to resist paying cash or get more outraged by pay to win type stuff, but remember the random mount outrage on this reddit when mount packs first came out.
---
We complained a lot, and rightly so, but the game was still filled with those stupid mounts almost immediately. The hardcore guys weren't running out and buying those packs. We were all yelling and screaming here. 
---
People in my casual guild didn't bat an eye to gamble on some mount skins, though. It's just part of their game.
---
I wish. I love scrapper hammer, but the attacks are too tanky and utility to be used in the dps overdrive that fractals and raids require
---
I use hammer with healing scrapper because I'm a fashion wars slave and anyways 99.9% of the time I use kits and this way I only need 1 ascended weapon (instead of one for mainhand and another for offhand)
---
Spellbraker barely uses daggers afaik. But to be honest, I've never met a spellbreaker on fractals or raids. And the only scrapper I've seen has been me :(
---
Still need to finish it but [how does this chart look](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Salvaging)? Though I do feel like I'm just recreating the [Salvage kit page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Salvage_kit) at this point..
---
K. I think that based on the number of different usernames saying they were banned that even if reddit represented the significant majority of players (and it doesnt for any subset of any set except reddit users), or even the majority of those that use addons, that more than 60ish people were likely banned in the last weekish.
---
Another thought/question: do higher kit levels with higher % rarer material give more and/or better luck essence too? Ie, using a Master kit on a blue might give more/better luck than using Journeyman kit on a blue?
---
&gt; Really? I buy stuff I don't use all the time. Coffee makers that I think I'll use until it becomes too annoying to maintain them or just instant is more convenient. I bought a blender to make smoothies that I loved, for just about a month. 
---
But you could see yourself using it right? I do that sort of thing too, but I'm not about to buy templates when I only use one.
---
And they seem themselves using it. No different.
---
It's like people who claim that the VAC ban on their Steam account was a mistake that Valve never corrected. No it fucking wasn't. "It was lag during a CS:GO match, I wasn't cheating!" Okay buddy.
---
I’m not personally convinced but I’ll agree to disagree
---
&gt; i still have yet too see any toxicity stemming from arcdps. i see people whining about the possibility of it all the time but have never actually seen it in game or even posts of it on reddit.
---
I am not sure, if you were around when arcdps was released and finally got approved by Anet 6-12 months later. There were discussions about dps meters popping up every other day at that time wether it should be allowed or not and those discussions were quite toxic most of the time (by both sides).
---
Granted, Anet takes a big chunk of the responsibility for that as well because they shouldnt have waited so long before either approving it or not.
---
Also, if they would have never allowed rcdps in the first place, there wouldnt be have been a 3rd party build template alternative available before they finally managed to implement their own and the shitshow that is going on right now would have been avoided too, while everybody would be praising build templates finally being released.
---
You know. Normally a major QoL feature like this would come with an expansion. Now that they are piecemealing "expansion-like content", they can't monetize it as such... Hm. Well. Food for thought.
---
&gt; I feel that this is the big one. If ArcDPS has been allowed for 4 years, why is it suddenly disallowed? Clearly it wasn't breaking any rules, and if it was, it was allowed to at the time. Remember, ArenaNet did have impact on its development.
---
&gt; This shows that the evaluation of the software was not really professionally objective. Their opinion changed as soon as they were in a position to make money. Their lack integrity is unethical.
---
You do realize that when they first came out - templates were nearly immediately removed from arc, right?  (iirc, it was a sort of misunderstanding from delta's side or accidental release type of situation - would have to dig into old posts to recall for sure)
---
We then got information that the templates would only be allowed until there was an official solution (back when arcdps templates got the green light).
---
You're painting it like this was never expected to happen - when it was the baseline agreement for the 3rd party tool's legitimacy.
---
&gt;6.05. Not promote their own interest at the expense of the profession, client or employer.
---
&gt; Due to their subjectiveness, they've clearly put their own interests at the expense of their client's (ours), which is the reason people are/were so mad at ArenaNet before the whole silly business with the bans.
---
You do realize this is about individuals, right?  Not to put the software developer's (read individual contributor's) interest above their clients/employers.  I.e. avoid conflicts of interest - such as selling a system design that they learned about/worked with others at Anet to some other gaming company for personal profit.
---
And I don't even really want to get into you first example because that one is entirely about software and it's usage/access.  Anyone can use/access the build templates out of the gate because there will be (a laughable amount of) free slots.
---
the owners of the chocobo and final fantasy would prefer A-net doesn't. Copyright and all that.
---
Every single time. A ban happens, then disinformation campaign begins to discredit the devs
---
I've said this for years, given the number of other games that do this. But based on the very little amount of information we've gotten confirmed from ANet, it likely has a lot to do with how they structured the loot rolling in the code. They can't outright tell us "This item has a 1% chance, this has a 0.0001% chance" because it doesn't work like that. Combine that with ANet's weird policy on staying silent about everything and you have a recipe for, well, exactly what happened.
---
I always wondered what would happen if someone were to post proof of doing huge openings on a dozen or so bags, just to gain credibility, and then followed it up with "thorough research" about dozens of others, all fabricated, just for the sake of fucking with people.
---
&gt;how does this chart look
---
I think this is actually great. I know it seems like overkill, but having this kind of consolidation is useful. I play with family members who don't readily pull things together so I can imagine there are a lot of folks like that and would find this useful.
---
I'm just not sure what you're disagreeing with. You may know they don't need ascended gear. They don't. They just know there's a higher tier of gear and they're used to having to get them from other games. And legendaries you buy for skins. They're all fashion guys. ZOMG bifrost would look so cool on my ele. That's all it is. Not sure what there is to even disagree with.
---
It is indeed meant to be that way, and several NPCs remark about it if you hang out in the city long enough for them to path by you.
---
Oh you're just talking about templates. I was talking about the more commonly held conception that casuals don't spend on the game. I honestly have no idea of whether guys in my guild will be templates specifically or not. Some may.  Does it mean changing outfits/skins easier to get a different look with one click? Until I see what they can do, I have no idea what people will use them for.
---
so there was discussion *about* toxicity? again, never any real toxicity because of the meter itself
---
and yes if they'd never allowed 3rd party templates the current shitstorm would be less severe or non existent, but that would also be the case had templates existed at launch as they should have. or if they were going to be free and unlimited, as they should be.
---
I agree. 
---
Saying that, I think this makes ArenaNet vulnerable to competition. That’s their biggest threat every time they piss off their audience. Many players are only here because there’s nowhere else to go. As soon as there is somewhere else to go, they will jump ship. And they won’t stay due to their investment, because it doesn’t seem like there’s much coming in the future.
---
That's what happens when you spend a lot of effort on designing something but not enough on maintaining it over time.

I would get this skin, just like I got the sparklepony for my belf in WoW, just to piss the Lisa Frank haters off.
---
It tastes just like raisins!
---
Consider getting the new Jackal skin, we'll likely never get a horse-based skin but it's got that wild foresty pretty look.

I'd say no: https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/85384-Touch-of-Madness

looks like it went from 80g to 30g the day halloween went live, then 30g to 20g over the next 3 days.  it was at 25g when Cogima posted his results.

Reading your comments elsethread, you were caught account-sharing, which is precisely what folks were banned for doing.

I think all the toxicity and divide has always been there. Arcdps just became the target of it. I remember groups asking players to ping gear or they kick, 5 warrior cof P1 runs etc. Arc imo is the target and scapegoat for players that get upset for not being carried by players that put effort into improving their play and want teammates that do the same.
---
You got the wrong person. I don't cheat or share my account. Still not banned.
---
So....How long  you been employed at Anet?
---
No other reason for all the cum guzzling from ya
---
feel free to count them because even if every single poster in these clusterfuck threads were banned it wouldn't even be close to significant.
---
There are still dedicated WvW guilds who are still playing the game mode, we haven't all left.
---
Randy and cheating, hell no, you clearly don't know this person

I use it often in Arah when I want to aggro things but I'm basically using a skill while ooc and quickly double clicking a GS in my inventory before getting in combat. Never would use it as my primary weapon obviously.
---
To be fair, the most recent time it happened, it turned out that many people were banned unfairly when Anet was "sure" they were not seeing false positives.  So you can say "nearly" all you want, but the occasion that sticks in people's minds is the previous botched ban wave.  Should people jump to conclusions?  No.  You can't entirely blame the player base for doing that based on past events though.

I'm surprised you say that. I dont use many elite specs that often, but the 4 or 5 I do use all use their new weapon. Reaper Necro is best with his GS I find, Scourge uses his torch often, especially a condi build. Druid uses the staff, even though it depends and Chrono I definitely use the shield in solo PvE.

One hour

The thing is that bans like this probably happen frequently and we don't ever hear about it. It's hard to predict which ones will result in a shitstorm on reddit and get in front of it.
---
Scg is shit dps and not worth the effort for its output pve wise. Support to allies also got fucked since shade change. Only play it if you like the concept.
---
A whole bucket? I only took it with a Vial of Salt[Vial of Salt](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vial_of_Salt).
---
You can use TOTP (eg. google authenticator) for GW2 now, no phone service needed.
---
Or I can report the afk and let Anet deal with it.
---
I would do that for food to
---
I was banned for not washing my hands after I went to the bathroom. Fuck ANet. You should all boycott.
---
I am an old school wvw player. I read all the negative, but came back anyway. No regrets other than the server I am on now is inactive in wvw. Spvp is about the same as always.
---
Then cantrip one is more useful as you can cleanse instantly. You also have regen cleanse from water spec which triggers on skills 3, 4 and glyph heal in water attunement.
---
Shout doesn't even do that better.

this is such an MMORPG moment- just exploring and stuff, keep on enjoying the game ;’)
