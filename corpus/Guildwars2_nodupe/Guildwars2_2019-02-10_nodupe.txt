Technically, "her importance to the world" is unrelated to her character persona, or even the connection to the PC. And her importance has been established since Hidden Arcana (Season 2 Episode 5's final instance) at the very latest. That'd be November 2014, which was 4 years 4 months ago.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Of course, one can argue that importance really began with Festival of the Four Winds 2014, when the existence of the egg was first indicated, which was, what, May 2014?
---
To varying degrees, it feels like a fan-fict writer patting themselves on the back.
---
At least they haven't praised themselves for the creative awesomness of Lazarus in GW2...
---
Smells like an attempt to manipulate the unid market.
---
The problem is you need 25 of them to make a set of **armor** and they're **weapon** upgrades.
---
Honestly, it's that that bugs me most.

He didn't say you can't get HoT stuff out of PoF bags, he specifically said chak egg sacs.

I main warrior, it's just fine for Fractals/Raids/Dungeons. Sometimes I bring the condi cleanse shout (Shake It Off!) to make up for some of the shortfalls. Check out metabattle for some build guides based on your preferred game play (Open World, PvP, Raids, WvW, Fracs, etc). Note that some builds (especially on Snowcrows) are built around GROUP compositions, and may be suboptimal for other modes of play.
---
I do find it handy to have multiple geared classes though, as well being able to play both Power and Condi warrior. I have a druid and a warrior and between them I can join any aspect of the game.
---
As for your server question, alas I am not equipped to answer that question (I'm on NA servers), so I am sorry about that.
---
At least on NA, there are a plethora of guilds that post recruitment messages in Map chat, most of which advertise for new, returning, and exp players. I don't imagine you'd have much difficulty finding a guild willing to help you out for any of the end-game content. You can also advertise yourself in map chat, and see what comes your way :D.

Just a little question. I've been playing years, but this has only just occurred to me that I don't actually know.   
---
I can't seem to find an answer online either.   
---
My question is... 
---
When stealing a boon, does this steal the entire stack or just one of that stack? 
---
For the majority of the game mode there were no pips at all and population was much much more healthy, people who just want easy rewards are the wrong people to appeal to imo.
---
The whole stack. Same goes for corrupting a stack of a boon, and taking/sending a stack of a condition.
---
thanks, i didnt bother digging it up
---
Nice work! Now I wonder if the GW2 devs were trying to instill a creeping, existential dread when they named [this skill.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Prestige)
---
Except the OP literally finds it hard to see because of the Chrono's fields specifically? Granted there's other cues like the yellow border and audio, but his problem had nothing at all to do with chrono balance and entirely based on the fact it places wells. 
---
Also accurate. For awhile Square was super excited about making new engine for new games. Codename Agis or Agnes or something. Either that was FF13 or 15 I can't remember now. But they realize the investment wasn't worth it and so now they use Unreal Engine for FF7 remake instead.
---
Upload them to imgur and then put a link in the comments 
---
Most people will avoid those game modes simply because they are competative and the population that do is dwindeling because of bad decisions and neglect by the devs, its as simple as that. They should not turn it into PvE with lots of rewards, then it just turns into silverwastes or istan and how to milk it for as much rewards as possible like all pve is in this game.
---
I think you got some of that very right, and some of that somewhat wrong.
---
&gt;“The world will die if a third Elder Dragon is killed ... This is why Joko calls them the ‘lifeblood of Tyria’ - because if you kill the Elder Dragons, you cause imbalance to The All; cause enough imbalance to The All and the world croaks.”
---
You are right this is the established consequence, however, only if an immediate solution isn’t present at the exact time of the dragon’s death. This is why we have been keeping Aurene with us so far – she, like other dragons, can consume magic before it causes an imbalance. This is what happened when Balthazar died, and Aurene and Kralkatorrik both took a share of Balthazar’s magic straight after his death.
---
&gt;“If dragons could use any magic they devoured, then there would be no ‘Elder Crystal Dragon’ and no ‘Elder Fire Dragon’. The Elder Dragons do not set aside magic that is not their domain for the others to eat.”
---
This is where I think you go a little off track, because I think it’s pretty clear the story disagrees with you. You seem to be arguing that there would be no such thing as an Elder Dragon with its own domain of magic because they consume magic from different sources all the time. I’ll suggest instead, and I think the story shows this, that a specific domain of magic is only ripe for taking when its original owner *dies*. Eating artifacts doesn’t count and the dragons aren’t willfully setting aside their powers: They die, and someone comes in and takes it. Remember, no Elder Dragon has *ever* died before Zhaitan, and straight after its death we see *all active dragons* using Zhaitan’s domain of magic. There *are* domains of magic but only very strong beings possess them: so far, Dragons and Gods (and maybe, just maybe… Joko?).
---
&gt;“Balthazar is similar - he absorbed magic from the Primordus, Jormag, and the Maguuma Bloodstone”
---
I think you’re misunderstanding something here. No one consumed any of Primordus or Jormag’s magic because the commander put them to sleep before Balthazar could kill Primordus. This is essentially why Path of Fire occurs: Balthazar wants to kill a dragon and consume its magic – we stop him from killing Primordus, and, in turn, he goes after Kralkatorrik. 
---
And that leads me to my own take. Kralkatorrik is shown in episode six (in the big attack) to possess four unique domains of magic: Balthazar’s, Mordremoth’s, Zhaitan’s, and his own (crystals and shit). Aurene hasn’t been shown to possess any specific domains of magic except her own ability to brand things, but presumably she possesses both Mordremoth’s and Balthazar’s powers, too. Question is whether or not Joko’s resurrection magic is actually, in a way, a domain much like the others’, and whether or not Aurene has that.

Apples and oranges is how competitors work, friend, regardless of our opinion on comparisons it's indisputable that these are other MMORPG's that are in contest for the same market share of massively multiplayer online games, and GW2's rivals are very open and proactive on the idea of optimization, regardless of execution.

As much as I agree with you, I don't think they're going to make any changes to the reward system for WvW anytime in the near ever.

Thanks, I hate it.

Have fun! I’ve been loving taking screenshots in the game, always need to remember how certain people places look like in the day and night. I don’t go there much but the groove is beautiful at night.
---
Okay, I have two trains of thought after reading this.
---
&gt; And that her death only allowed her to escape the world
---
I've had a fascination with the idea of "escaping" Tyria for a long time, because really, Tyrian afterlife is still a part of the Mists, and we are even explicitly told that the gods come from somewhere beyond the Mists.  So Tyria does seem like some kind of closed cycle governed by the existence of Elder Dragons. So wouldn't the endgame eventually be escaping? Or, at the very very least, Aurene could use her newfound freedom to chase after the gods and see what's up out there.
---
On the complete flip side:
---
&gt; Your magic becomes something else. But it's staying in Tyria.
---
So our current afterlife system is of various locations within the Mists, assuming someone's soul isn't trapped in tangible Tyria. But death is still a very real concept.
---
Combining your theory with Glint's hope for Elder Dragons who share magic rather than hoarding it, what if, in some odd way, the concept of death is fundamentally changed at the end? Magic/souls would no longer be so sought after for power, and the new Elder Dragons would be able to purify the corrupted spirits.
---
The Mists could, in a highly theoretical way, stabilize and become more peaceful as those balancing everything are no longer in eternal conflict with the world itself.
---
I dunno, forgive my rampant speculation. But I like your theory and the possibilities it opens! (Also I appreciate having Joko's knowledge be meaningful, not just the fact that he's a lich.)
---
Thanks, but I already know how to wipe my own zerg

I enjoy it for travel time but when I'm about to clash with a force inside of Hills on teh bridge and they just glide to safety, I'm reminded why I thought this was gonna be fucking awful. Also the biggest issue is being able to glide while already in combat. In WvW at least, it should be like mounts where you cannot deploy glider so you're not just escaping a fight through having terrain advantage (which is really shitty especially in roaming when people already have so many more advantages while fighting in their own zones - stats and structures they can go hide inside)
---
Hey! First off, glad you're enjoying the game :-)
---
Some clarification regarding HoT and PoF. You don't need to finish either story to get the gliding/mounts. In HoT, just unlock the mastery track you want (probably gliding at first, but you'll be directed to which masteries are needed for story progression) and any time you play in HoT maps, you'll get experience for that until the bar is full and you can spend the earned mastery points to learn the skill. In PoF, you only need to do the first instance (10-15 mins) to unlock the first mount (raptor). After that, the only mount which NEEDS to have story finished is the griffon (Open Skies is the achievement). All other mounts can be purchased from NPCs provided you fulfill their requirements (not story related).
---
When I get my toon to level 80, first thing I do is join an HP train (at least in HoT they run almost every day it seems, starting in Verdant Brink, but check LFG) and Max out BOTH specializations. On a train, you should be able to get them all maxed out in 2-4 hours of playtime. That way, who cares what the debate it, you can just swap a trait line and try out the play style to see if you like it.
---
Acquiring ascended armour can be done in many way, though depending on World Boss drops will take you a LONG time. I personally crafted my first set, and now I use raid currency to buy pieces that I don't get from drops in raids or T4 fractals. tl;dr raids and fractals have armour drops much more frequently than world bosses, and what's missing can be supplemented with currency. Trinkets can be had many ways, depending in the stat you want. I suggest checking the wiki to know how best to direct your efforts.
---
IMO, the new year event is great for achievement hunting and gold. Buy the max Divine Lucky envelopes (16) and sell them on the to daily to make a few gold. Not a lot else to do, besides a few rounds of Dragonball.
---
You can party with up to four others (5 people including you) to do the story with. It makes it a lot of fun, and dealing with the last chapter of HoT is easier with friends!
---
As for gold, doing T4s, raids, farming Silverwastes and Meta Events, etc all make good gold. There are quite a few resources for gold making, too many to lost on here.
---
Good luck!
---
At this point you could just tell me that I should not follow GW2 story, because Game of Thrones one is written in better way. Because if you want to throw in one basket all things that one can do to relax and spend some time with, then why only limit yourself to video games?
---
That's because blizzard is positioning WoW to be a  legacy intellectual property, and this reinvigorates the player base just as much as it does the title itself.
---
GW2 doesn't seem like it's in a position where it makes hard sense to do the same right now.  Contextually, it's just not vital to the bottom line or content.
---
&gt; I think you got some of that very right, and some of that somewhat wrong.

---
Magic isn't causing the imbalance. Though magical build up is an issue, as stated during Small Victory:
---
&gt; &lt;Character name&gt;: Taimi, focus... When Balthazar died, Kralkatorrik absorbed most of his freed energy.
---
&gt; &lt;Character name&gt;: Kralkatorrik's even stronger and more dangerous than ever.
---
&gt; Taimi: Oh boy. That could seriously accelerate the Elder Dragon imbalance. I should run some worst-case hypotheticals right away.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Small_Victory_(Epilogue)#Dialogue
---
It isn't "the magical imbalance" but "the Elder Dragon imbalance". Or, more accurately, The All imbalance.
---
&gt; This is where I think you go a little off track, because I think it’s pretty clear the story disagrees with you. You seem to be arguing that there would be no such thing as an Elder Dragon with its own domain of magic because they consume magic from different sources all the time.

There are domains of magic but only very strong beings possess them: so far, Dragons and Gods (and maybe, just maybe… Joko?).
---
The issue with your line of argument is that the Elder Dragons are taking magic from the ley lines and artifacts. And like I said, they're not setting aside types of magic that aren't their own. They're consuming *all* magic available to them. Key to this is that during Season 3, Taimi states that the Elder Dragons' magic also exists within the ley lines:
---
&gt; Taimi: The chak feed off ley energy, right?
---
&gt; Taimi: And we know that each dragon has a "domain" when it comes to their magic; Zhaitan's was death, obviously.
---
&gt; Taimi: Well you know what's guaranteed to give chak a bad stomachache? Death magic!
---
&gt; Taimi: Spencer filters "death" out of ley energy!
---
&gt; &lt;Character name&gt;: So magic is almost like light. Broken up into a spectrum.
---
&gt; Taimi: That's a perfect way to think about it!
---
&gt; Taimi: Magic as we know it is like white light, composed of all the different types of dragon magic.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Taimi's_Game#Dialogue
---
This, of course, is a little confusing since plant and death magic is volatile to each other as seen during A Crack in the Ice, and with Primordus' Fire and Jormag's Ice being opposites, an elementalist should be exploding every time they mix fire and ice magic.
---
An Elder Dragon's domain isn't limited to being within the Elder Dragon itself. Chak filter out death magic naturally when they consume magic from the ley lines. Unless it turns out that they're filtering out all dragon magic which has been added to the ley lines since killing Zhaitan and Mordremoth (which we have no reason to believe currently), then they've been doing this for some time.
---
And no, Joko is using necromancy. Normal, regular necromancy. He may be a strong lich, but he's no more special than Khilbron, Fendi Nin, Livia, Eve, or Nola Sheppard in the end.
---
&gt; I think you’re misunderstanding something here. No one consumed any of Primordus or Jormag’s magic because the commander put them to sleep before Balthazar could kill Primordus. This is essentially why Path of Fire occurs: Balthazar wants to kill a dragon and consume its magic – we stop him from killing Primordus, and, in turn, he goes after Kralkatorrik.
---
And here you are incorrect. During Flashpoint, Balthazar puts himself into the machine was was channeling Primordus' and Jormag's energy. From there, he was absorbing that magic that was being exchanged between the two. He didn't need to kill Primordus to get that power, he just needed to drain Primordus of that power using the machine.
---
This is why Balthazar is so much more powerful in Path of Fire than in Flashpoint. Developers even directly confirmed this in the Path of Fire AMA. Balthazar got a massive power boost from absorbing Primordus' and Jormag's magic from Taimi's Machine.
---
He goes after Kralkatorrik because he isn't satisfied with the amount of power he got from Primordus and Jormag; for revenge against the Six, he needs more power, and he always intended to kill *all* Elder Dragons anyways.
---
&gt; Aurene hasn’t been shown to possess any specific domains of magic except her own ability to brand things, but presumably she possesses both Mordremoth’s and Balthazar’s powers, too.
---
In The Crystal Dragon instance, as Aurene flies off to get Kralkatorrik's attention, she opens a rift into the Mists, just like Kralkatorrik's rifts but blue hued instead of purple hued, and flies through it. She shows off Balthazar's power. She should have some of Mordremoth's *and Zhaitan's* as original concept called her an "baby undead crystal dragon" and her infant form's chin was very clearly Mordremoth-influenced.
---
And despite all that, nobody would care. The point of the message and post is simply to make them take the mean boxes away so we can get the daily easy. Nobody cares about the content in the first place; unless the rewards were substantially higher, nobody would bother anyway.

the packs are usually about 8+gold during the year. but yea you don't make the current years ones(boar) and sell them now. you hoard em till next year and sell em so yea u need the space. you should be crafting dogs right now. but i see the great boars have tanked in price and the cost to order right now is about even with crafting it from scratch, boars might even be worse. If u have the space or couple alt accounts just hold the 100-500 items on yer tp for a couple years. heh. maybe i'll delete my comments later :D

I wanna get rytlock ripping a rift through my flesh and peering through from inside my chest

---
&gt;"Magic isn't causing the imbalance. Though magical build up is an issue, as stated during Small Victory"
---
I totally agree and I worded it badly. It's all about the balance between the big entities. I think more accurately put than the first time, if one of the pillars holding the balance up (an Elder Dragon for example) falls, something needs to take its place pretty quickly, or the consequences start showing.
---
&gt;"The issue with your line of argument is that the Elder Dragons are taking magic from the ley lines and artifacts. And like I said, they're not setting aside types of magic that aren't their own.

---
I don't disagree but I also think you're ignoring the vital part of when an Elder Dragon acquires the abilities the abilities that come with a domain of magic. Consuming ley magic or artifacts is not the same as possessing that domain. We might say that Zhaitan's and all the other dragons' magics were in the ley lines before Zhaitan died, and they each consumed some that didn't directly belong to them. However, none of the other dragons could do what Zhaitan did until after it died.
---
&gt;"And here you are incorrect. During Flashpoint, Balthazar puts himself into the machine was was channeling Primordus' and Jormag's energy. From there, he was absorbing that magic that was being exchanged between the two.

---
I'm a little unsure on that and I'll take your word for it. Balthazar probably got a lot more powerful in that attack. But I'll stick to my guns and say that the difference is that neither Jormag nor Primordus died, and none of them seem to have given up their powers. The only explicit powers we've seen been traded between dragons have all still come from dead entities.
---
"I'm casual and I only have 30 mins a day to play the game. I don't have the time to build siege and all that stuff, let me just jump in with my 30$ bunny skin, get my daily and logoff. I paid for this game and it's not fair to casuals who don't have enough time to enjoy it."
---
I'd put /s but unfortunately this is the reality we live in.
---
Yea I totally understand. But honestly it goes both ways, everyone just has to adapt to the gliding. Wvw has to evolve somehow even if it's as silly as gliding.
---
I remember when they introduced gliding in WvW and everyone was against it, even I was totally against it thinking how op it would be to just glide away. But Imo Anet did a good job with the implementation. Tbh I feel like Anets biggest mistake was not implementing gliding in WvW with the release of HoT. Desert border would have made so much sense with gliding. 
---
These asura frighten me. 
---
I mean, they're basically Engineers but +10-20 years
---
Gvg meta is shifting to condi. Power still heavily dominates in blobs. Gvg doesn't affect meta in any way.
---
Daniel Dociu was the art director. Eric Flannum was the lead designer.
---
Nope, it was Eric Flannum.
---
Return of the repair hammer :D
---
&gt;no, gliding is one reason why the numbers continued dwindling.
---
why do you think so? I know some players worried about gliding Because it could lead game breaking cheesy tactics. But it didn't. 
---
I've seen players quitting wvw for FB+Scourge meta(before nerf)but not for gliding.
---
Indeed, just a translator that increased performance for so many people. Done by a redditor with the help of few others. Imagine Anet having a spasm and actually dedicating some workforce in that department. Translator or not, everyone would love to have that free "unsignificant" (Anet, 2016) performance. Worked wonders for some. 
---
Not the most familiar with solo Cms. Why is there a dead chrono throughout the fight?
---
It will undoubtedly be based on the GW1 engine, and that's fine. Modifying the GW1 engine isn't inherently bad. Practically every major game engine is based on a previous game engine because creating a new engine from scratch is absurd.
---
No Monkey-ing around!
---
And you are not comperhending the fact people were crying (probably gave up) for some sort of magical performance fix. After some debate about directx9 and 12 and then engines, one of the devs stated rewriting the engine code to run on dx12 would yield minimum performance (around percent if I recall).
---
I have literally 0 knowledge in these things but what I can see is dx9 translated to dx12 increased performance for some people by a huge chunk (16 fps in crowded areas, smooth flying, no stutters/tearing). It was created by a single person at first and my question here is why doesnt Anet pursue this option, dont they want gw2 to run better? Why would dx9 to dx12 give performance boost while native dx12 engine wouldnt boost at all then?
---
Personally not demanding a re-write, rather justification of  /ignore on the matter. 
---
Lol, this character looks like something I would make.  
---
I have 11 mules that turned into full fledged characters.  I do some stupid shit sometimes.
---
Sounds like your rotation is bad. Also, are you sure you're using [the most updated build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/)?
---
This I agree with.  But, newbies could try the LFG and make a learning squad.  They still have to live with the reality that they're gonna get steamrolled from time to time.
---
The #1 detractor to competitive game modes is fear of getting beat down by other people.  Some get up, but most give up.

You're lucky that norn survived.

I used to have a norn myself. His name was Douglas. He was a norn with pink sprinkled everywhere, even has the same mustache and hair. But then I thought to myself, that I don't want him anymore; I have istan, and I want a toon slot for my ele, so he died in DR, in front of people.
---
He was a good boi.

Thanks for sharing! It's always nice to see more lore focused videos being made about the interesting characters and events from Guild Wars verse. I like your juxtaposing your character Toran's zealous commentary with the history lesson of what little we know of Grenth, and using clips from the core story and expansions to illustrate your point (e.g. the pillar of light from the fall of Mordremoth being used for Grenth shattering Dhuum's tower in the Underworld). The transitions and cross cuts that you used to emphasize the narration were well put together and spiced up the video in a nice way. :)
---
If ANet ever decided to have more books written about the Guild Wars franchise, Grenth's story from his birth through his ascendacy as the new God of Death and being forced to face Abaddon in a titanic battle at the shore of the Crystal Sea would be a fascinating read. The novel could show the seeds of Grenth's resentment towards Dhuum's harsh policy on no resurrections, him trying to initially figure out his place in Tyria as the demigod son of the venerated leader of the gods who can't quite belong to either humans or the gods fully as a liminal being, befriending seven mortals who would become his faithful Reapers, choosing to face Dhuum without the other gods' help, bearing the burden of godhood upon his ascendancy, selecting his first followers such as Desmina and establishing the necromancer doctrine of casting down false idols and revealing the truth of the world, joining the four gods' side against Abaddon, perhaps culminating in the tragedy of him growing distant from the mortals he once lived with as his duties as a god would ultimately take him elsewhere in the aftermath of Abaddon's rebellion so much so that he wouldn't even lift the finger to help stop Dhuum's escape attempts in the Underworld in the following centuries.

What is the chest armor skin on Kyle's mom?
---
I've been pleased at the relative scarcity of Slippery Slope recently, but you're right, the Birds are invading.
---
Sounds a bit like you mixed something up.
---
Are you by chance using support chrono traits, utilities and/or runes alongside, while aiming for the DPS variant numbers.
---
10-20k dps would make some sense in that regard. So check everything, twice.
---
Eitherway, since you played chronotank in the past, do you want to go for Support-chrono again, or do you want to switch to DPS solely? (At best you'd most likely want to switch at least between dps chrono zerk and condi mirage... or let's say certain raid teams want you to, if not at all to another class).
---
Pick the right thing you want, and go straight for it. Watch some rotation guides and... grind the dummy kind of until you memorize it yourself.
---
Can't say for dx12, but devs said that we'd gain nothing substantial with dx11
---
"bank is an almost unlimited inventory and nearly unlimited shared inventory slots."

As if anyone has any free inventory slots in their bank XD
---
Yeah, I came back to this thread specifically to complain. I did everything right. Skipped cutscenes where possible, pressed space bar through unskippable ones, etc. It doesn't matter. I just dc'ed out of the LWS2 mission where you go through glint's lair. That shit is excruciating at best. This is ridiculous. How is this still a problem after this many years?
---
The birds are the worst :(
---
Found this funny when running daily fractals and thought some of you here would get a kick out of it :)
---
Here, how about I tell you they should restructure the entire skills system where it's not about who press the keys first but about positioning, outplaying, kiting, defending etc.
---
Skills CD is now 5 times longer and most dmg will rely on autoattacks. Try that for a week and tweak it from there. The problem with GW2 PvP, actually that's MMO PvP in general, I can't stress enough -- visual clusterfuck and no fucking skill needed -- spam more with better fps = win.
---
I hate to compare with MOBAs but it's pretty much LoL Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode. Spam spam, wow I'm so good. Least LoL had done something so right even in URF mode, YOU CAN FUCKING DODGE THE PROJECTILES. In GW2, you get random obstructed projectiles (while melee cleaves through wall/collision out of whack), projectile range going beyond 1500, AoE absurdly huge and spammable for some classes (cough scourge).
---
Anyways, promote the non spam PvP and you'll be able to tweak skills where it's about the timing and combo entirely. Hell, gw2 doesn't even use MP or such resources.
---
You know you can still see them on occasion in OG Guild Wars handing out missions as they supposedly came back in time from the future to complete missions imperative to the survival of everyone.
---
I liked the video
---
The [Minstrel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TczkHagUW3k), which mostly survived in the form of Maklain in Cursed Shores and holidays, and his gear stats.
---
You absolute heathen
---
Considering they are saying this while sitting on Red BL's spawn, be worried.
---
I would say Power Chrono Duel/Illu, since he can pretty much keep 25 might, fury, quickness and some alacrity. The only problem would be you lack healing if you take any damage since your healing skill is a big part of your rotation.
---
Okay, good point. xD
---
Hands down it's Weaver but that's only if you figured out staying alive/up doing more dmg than waste time in downed state. The other that does just about the same wreckage and great for bosses like these is the condi soulbeast :)
---
Wayyyy higher survivability and you can carry on the dmg via condo ticks even through shield phase.
---
My "both ways" would be to transfer the existing WvW Dev team to another project, then bring in a brand new WvW team. Based on past performance, the odds of getting a better outcome is higher with a brand new team entirely.
---
Disagree, gliding was a good addition to the mode.
---
Cavalier Rifle, the best rifle. 
---
Wow you just lost half of the crowd that plays this game haha.
---
I do agree WvW RIP
---
yeah I stopped at the pvp ones. Thats just crazy. Its like those shitty mobile games that stops you from playing because you dont have x currency. That would fuckibg suck, it would make it so much worse. 
---
Plus, your thing about reporting, thats what the report bytton is for, you literally explain something that is already in every mmo, including gw2. Its just fucking retarded to add that if you arent good enough you get punished too. The system is fine how it is, dunno how you thought this could change anything. 
---
Just dont expect anyone to take this seriously, no thought was put into your rant and your requests/ideas are ridiculous. 
---
And weak finish with pointless "pve" (half of those apply to all modes..)
---
were they AFK or something?
---
i salute you douglas your story even if its a silly one but deep (ಥ﹏ಥ) for the altoholic one
---
Am I the only one that doesn't even try to theorize anymore? I used to be so, so big on GW1-2 lore; but the living story repeatedly shits on everything we supposedly know... So I don't try anymore.
---
The story has been getting better, thankfully, but there really isn't much respect for the established world, even in the latest episodes.
---
No. I want p2w. 
---
The answer to these threads is pretty much always some form of mesmer
---
7000 is not a lot though.
---
That's the game's built-in high post-processing in Mistlock.
---
Now now, there's no need to start raven.
---
Fractals can aspire to being best gw2 content ever if only they removed instabilities.
---
This post will always have 0 upvotes.
---
Best way to farm Unbound Magic?
---
If enough people stop playing fractals maybe they will change them. I used to play daily, now I log in for weekends and usually log off immediately because my static moved on to other games.
---
If you’re time frame is only 6 months your reaction is not realistic and likely resulted from playing with a disillusioned part of the community. The newer fractals moved away from the boss-&gt;boss-&gt;boss template. The other main thing that changed is instabilities. There are a few annoying ones but the majority of them are easier and more fun to deal with. 
---
If you played fractals 3 years ago or maybe even just before CM’s released then sure I can see the validity in your opinion but definitely not 6 months. 
---
Download [GW2 TacO](http://tekkitsworkshop.net/index.php/gw2-taco/download), go to each Living Story map, and follow the path to every living story node.  Consume the drops.  If you're lazy, Bitterfrost Frontier and Siren's Landing are the best yield for your effort.
---
Also farm someone's full home instance
---
Engineers remember.
---
Fair enough, from a sound design perspective I enjoyed the new map immensely, especially the cavern parts. 
---
I think the meta’s are a decent success. There is a reason to come back and do them. We will have to see if this lasts however as less people require the stats in burst. I enjoy the metas, though this is from a perspective that i’ve accepted that they wont be releasing complex challenging metas anymore. 
---
From an exploration point of view I think the map did well. I spend a a good amount of time discovering little Easter eggs, events, the “jp” and the puzzler rooms. Probably only second to jahai bluffs since it had an overload of collections. 
---
The map had good improvements in terms of guiding aspects. This might be controversial though some people prefer less guidance from npc’s. 
---
All in all I would say it is my second favorite map of this season behind jahai bluffs but that is just my opinion and will largely differ depending on what you subjectively value in a map as I personally enjoy collections and metas. 
---
I wont go much into a debate regarding a story as that would be a too complex discussion for reddit but a think attributing the success rate of the story primarily on the emotional impact is an over simplification. 
---
Did the same thing tonight in PvP, after about a year of being a mediocre vanilla/chrono. Copy/paste the metabattle build, and suddenly I can't die.
---
Sounds like you don't enjoy the game. Maybe you need to move on also?
---
[So You Want to Gear Your Character](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character)
---
That is the most comprehensive and up to date way to easily and speedily gets Asc. equipment for your character. Note that Asc. Gear does take a long time. But GW2's policy is grind once; the rest is cosmetic. When you are setup you are good until you quit GW2, come back 5 years, and the gear will STILL be the highest quality and not require replacements.
---
When I play something like harrier renegade or power bannerwarrior in fractals, then my APM is always below 30. Im fighting with a chronic tendinitis, and on bad days gw2 is the only game I can play because it has such low APM and long times I can simply "rest" my wrists.
---
So Im sorry for you, but I really cannot understand your point.
---
What I do however see quite commonly in fractals, is that players dont even know the slightest bit about what their class can bring in terms of utility. What fractals/instabs are troubling you? Its probably more an issue of not bringing the right tools... like reflect or more condi clear... the new instabs can mostly be countered quite nicely.
---
Birds? -&gt; more aoe cleave or condi remove
---
We Bleed Fire? -&gt; reflect/destroy the big ones
---
All the boon instabs? -&gt; bring tons of boon remove, domi power chrono or spellbreaker excel at those
---
Condi instabs? -&gt; bring tons of condi remove, holo healturret, condi remove mantra on fb or chrono, power slb with healing trap etc.
---
Flanking instabs? -&gt; bring more pulls or hide behind corners to pull mobs to you
---
Quite honestly, except for slippery slope - and even that is a fun one to me, not an annoying one - I find all instabs improved compared to the old ones.
---
Please stop asking Anet to dumb down content and instead take the tools the game offers you to properly counter things. This game is really more than casual enough already. Any more, and I could just as well play some stupid browser game instead.
---
You came in with your own Zerg and pressed buttons to wipe an afk Zerg...
---
Congrats?
---
Idk if this was meant to be a joke video or a flex sorta thing but it’s kinda just... pointless.
---
Not to sound rude, but the fun of an RPG is the journey itself. Do you not enjoy the story elements, characters, or build crafting?
---
Came into the thread hoping to make this joke. Looks like you beat me to it!
---
To this day, I have* "Awww heck, that don't look right"* engraved in my brain.
---
My guess would be to help him get to Arkk haha. I imagine the second boss is very difficult to solo
---
Holy fuck, I knew they were in GW1, but I didn't think they were brought here too!
---
Birds are *super* annoying for 2 reasons: You have to waste a dodge and you're being punished for others mistakes of not dodging. 
---
I used to hate old SA because my party members would do more damage to me than the mobs would. Now I get swarmed by birds because my party members have the reaction speed of a goldfish. At *minimum* the birds should spawn aggro'd to whoever spawned them. Why do I have to be punished for others mistakes?
---
Legendary alternatives seem to be the most logical and least polarizing. We got armor a year or so ago, weapons are easy enough to get in any game mode, but trinkets haven't come to PvP/wvw yet. Mounts will be seen as awful at first by the vocal wvw players (and honestly I'm not too jazzed at this idea) and I don't see how they could implement them without reworking every map. Another map seems logical, but would require a ton of work to balance, considering there aren't many people working on wvw in general.   
---
Only other plausible alternative is a special event, either super weird one time, or reoccurring.
---
In your video it is clearly visible that you got [Charged Mists](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charged_Mists) instead of [Song of the Mists](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Song_of_the_Mists).
---
But not less impressive. 
---
Looking to start playing again after a while. Just read about the Istan nerf so what's the best way of farming Volatile Magic and Desert Contracts?
---
If you enjoyed GW2's story, try out GW1. It's a different game, and it's unforgiving in some mechanics, but that challenge is what a lot of people loved. 
---
I know they don't have the time or people to playtest every instability on every fractal but I'm glad they at least do it on the CMs so there won't be any easily avoidable issues like this or continuously spawning adds being affected by Last Laugh.
---
You will see more of Joko in Season 4 content. 
---
Perhaps a different game, mate. It's good to delve into a different world for a while. I've been around since beta and I still enjoy GW2 because I take little breaks when I can. 
---
Not sure why they don't just pool all their resources into a true single player narrative game. The MMO part of the game clearly struggles due to low budget.
---
Eh lame isn’t really what I meant, to be honest I was struggling with trying to articulate how I felt about it. I guess a more accurate explanation is when I accomplish something with my toon I feel as if my characters accomplishment is in part due to the success of the legend and in doing so detracting from my characters worth? I’m not sure. Don’t get me wrong, I love my revenant, it’s been my main since it’s release haha for me I guess it’s dependent on wether or not our character is harnessing the legends abilities or beckoning the legend to use their skills on behalf of the revenant. 
---
&gt;I didn't do the dungeons, so did I miss something? 
---
All of the story stuff about you becoming besties with Destiny's Edge and bringing them back together. :)
---
If you look on YouTube Wooden Potatoes did them all recently.
---
It offers a lot if you're a day 1 player. Most of the main content is years old.
---
Yeah you're correct in that, fixed link.
---
Haven't had that issue. Been around since the beginning. Taking breaks from the game helps. 
---
Yup 2nd boss isn't really possible to solo on rev, he's the guy who I usually duo 100 with.
---
&gt;Still don't quite get how Balthazar was going to use Aurene against the Big K - I understood that they're not invulnerable, but the how still isn't clear
---
From S3 on he was drawing magic power from every source he could find since the other gods left him (sort of) powerless when they gave him the boot from the pantheon. He saw Vlast and Aurene as batteries that would be easier to drain than the elder dragons themselves 
---
Taking breaks only does so much when you come back to the same fractals, raids, and metas that you've done a million times since they came out in 2013/2015.
---
Its just too hard to break into w5 and 6 in the current game (NA). My friend and I have pretty much farmed 1-4 for a while before PoF. Took a break from raiding, and would like to go and do 5-6. However, almost no training runs exist, and its even hard to sneak into exp runs to practice mechanics as many are gated by KP requirements. 
---
I dont think raids are dead. But the barrier to entry is pretty massive and keeping the community from getting fresh players, so dwindling numbers can happen.
---
I don't really like 99 that much compared to 100 and have a lot less experience with. Might give MAMA a try if I get bored enough.
---
Then I recommend a different game. Or perhaps new people to play this one with. 
---
Source is also stuck on DX9, Source 2 however supports Vulkan, D3D11 and OpenGL natively.
---
They're just for fun, really. The combat is smooth enough to last you a little while, at least.
---
I wish I could get tattoos T_T
---
I understand and I don't actively play at the moment. Just addressing your question about people getting bored. 
---
I think the main reason for that mentality is that ANet don't communicate their plans or have any open discussion about what wvw players want, not to mention people like it for different reasons. 
---
Every time they update and it's something the players don't want, it's frustrating to see how much time was wasted since they refuse to communicate, especially with updates being so few and far between, that's just telling us to wait another year for their next attempt at updating the mode.
---
I have started doing t4's after a while off. It's not so much harder but all the new instabilities are taking getting used to.
---
I couldn't figure out what all there damn birds were attacking me lol.
---
I can see where you're coming from with the lame comment. Martial artist monk archetypes are some of my favorites, precisely because the character doesn't rely on anything besides their own skill and body.
---
As for revenants, the weapon skills and dodge do seem to be unflavored Mists magic that they'd be able to conjure without the help of a legend. I think the "energy" mechanic of revenants is a measure of their own power to channel magic from the Mists, and not a measure of the legend's strength.
---
When invoking, I don't think the legends have a choice in the matter; most of the available legends just appear to consent to being invoked. Shiro "demands you release him," though that could be in regards to unleashing him upon enemies or something. He and Mallyx also attempt to threaten the player character in idle dialogues, but it's always shrugged off, so the revenants seem to be quite in control.
---
I think someone else in the thread mentioned that this game is probably entering its death throws. We can basically expect to see LWS releases and minor patches for the entirety of its remaining life cycle, because all the main devs have left and funding for the game on a whole has decreased. Basically, LWS episodes are a lot cheaper to manufacture and don't take up as much time and effort as a full blown expansion the size of PoF or HoT. 
---
Remember how well the Golem Rush event went?
---
No, the biggest problem is that investing in optimization removed dev time for content, which gives us content drought, which drives more people away than would come back with a more optimized game
---
Holy cow ANet, give this guy a job
---
Oh dear, can you say what KEY difference is between DX12 natively and DX12 translator? I mean what should be done to call it "DX12 natively"? 
---
And you should know, that v0.4 was a very buggy translator(so i don't even show it up for public), now this is v0.9.6.2 and works very very good. Some things still need work, but nothing born ideal.
---
It sounds like you need to find a new static, or a group of people a guild I dare say with a focus in the area(s) of the game that interests you and you want to do.
---
&gt;• "you can get into tower &lt;blah&gt; by getting on this peculiar rock and griffon-flapping at the right time" 
---
&gt;
---
&gt; • "there's a mesmer in my bootgarri! Bunny-rabbited over the wall again!"
---
Are you talking about current situation of red border?
---
&gt; interact
---
i guess watching is technically interacting if you sometimes gotta move slightly to keep watching
---
Do you honestly think that they're going to tell you about action taken against other specific players?
---
I am really pissed that they haven't fixed the roller beetle time racing crash with the Mac 64 client.  So the current state is that GW2 sucks, support is down, development is poor, new content is not very interesting and poorly written.  Overall I am very disappointed.
---
Great art, props to the artists! Those colors fit so well in a tattoo 
---
[removed]
---
&gt; Anet will release new game
---
a mobile game
---
DO YOU honestly think I would expect them to tell me?  What I do expect is to see that these two players are NOT ONLINE playing GW2 every time I check because they didn't get disciplined at all.
---
Have you set up the golem with the proper condi's and yourself with the proper buffs? It sounds like you have no boons/banners etc
---
Must've cost an arm. 
---
Ill show myself out

But you can watch a magnificent summary cinematic that explain in detail everything about it in LA!

Ah, no you can't, it barely hints to you missing it!

Each expansion on it's own is $30, buying the bundle (adding HoT to PoF) is $20 more for a total of $50. When there is a sale on PoF it applies to the bundle as well so 50% off would mean the $50 bundle drops to $25 which is the cheapest you could get both for. Other sites can have sales on the bundle as well but they usually go off the full price ($60) so a 50% off sale for them only drops it to $30, but they happen more often then the anet ones. If you're looking to get it now [DLGamer has the bundle for 38% off the full price](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911) or you can get one and wait for a sale. In the end though all the expansion content is after hitting level 80 (max level) so don't feel super pressured to get the expansions right away (though some of the free to play limits are pretty restrictive). 
---
Yes, you'll get 2 more bag slots unlocked and more character slots. [You can see the restrictions here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account#Free_accounts).
---
So.. even though you could adjust to the enemy team and change class when it's needed you chose to be an asshole and play single class to post it on leddit ... as if it was notable achievement? Nice
---
May be, videos of both things are 7 years old. 
---
how a certain anti cheat spyware feature was coded recently...
---
&gt; Talk about down-hill, Anet is ruining what little of GW2 is left.
---
Ehh, no.
---
First of all, it is not ArenaNets obligation to inform players that those players they have reported actually got banned.
---
Secondly, if you fall for phishing attempts it is your own damn fault. There is a reason why everyone legit always says "we never ask for your password". There is even a [wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mail) and distinctive visual indications that a message is not being sent by ArenaNet.
---
And last but not least, banning takes time. Let's assume they would ban anyone in a matter of hours, what exactly would prevent me from creating a free to play account and report you to get you banned? Nothing really because it is a throwaway account. But those things need to be investigated and that takes time because you are not the only one bothering the support but other players as well.
---
Can you imagine Charr Commandos in this style for GW3?
---
&gt;I didn't do the dungeons, so did I miss something?
---
Yes, the whole Destiny's Edge plot about Logan and his guild/friends.

Pugs are pretty good. 3 dps, 1 chrono 1 healer (dudu/firebrand/rene/Ele). You can usually clear easily in 1 hour t4 + recs. If the Group is good, add half an hour and you can clear cms too.
---
I crafted ad infinitum a few days ago and didn't find it hard to find Pugs to farm things or doing specific cms
---
Not much, yeah. 
---
Changing to DX12 with proper multithreading is the only viable option to fix GW2s horrible performance. (Unless they want to switch to Vulkan, which i doubt.)
---
I disagree, and I think the greatest effect it had is make the desert borderland actually fun.
---
Tis no joke
---
Notice how all of your mentioned specs are pof specs.
---
&gt; The biggest reason why the rewards can't be buffed is cuz toons can be parked and account with the most toons can get on and open more of them. So that's off the table.
---
on the first day after the latest eopisode release I tried to park as many alts in the last room of the plate puzzle. the next day they all got ported out automatically. they could do that with JP too.
---
lmao and i thought the family guy one was the epic one
---
I feel like in-terms of introducing instabilities ArenaNet tends to start with an existing mechanic like Mad King runes (birds) and do their best to re-use older mechanics.  Birds + Afflicted is horrifying.  It doesn't help much that birds seems to simultaneously apply to your entire party, and it doesn't seem to scale very well either; it's just annoying trash DPS that wastes a dodge.  
---
Wasn't there some story part that said that Joko built a dam somewhere? Could this be it?
---
Dx12 would mean only Windows 10 users would benefit from it.
---
You are definitely not wrong. But from what I have seen players definitely want WvW. If it is stagnant it is only because of the issues with it. So from your comment you are saying if players are not playing because it has issues, don't address it until we can figure out how to milk more money out of players first. Then we will fix the major things and watch the "growth" from microtransactions. That's pretty much what I said in my initial comment.
---
Luminous light regalia:)
---
August 2016
---
DX12 is fine, just make it **optional** so older Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1) users can keep playing with DX9. Vulkan is quite nice though because it works with older Windows.
---
I use Win7 until Microsoft fixes Win10 for good (final nail to the coffin was that an Win10 update deleted random important files).

Sunspears are an Order like, the Order of Whispers or Vigil etc.
---
They are the people that defeated The fallen God Abbadon over 250 Years ago and why Kormir is a God now (Story of the 3rd Campaign of GW1)
---
You said that all games are that way now. I’m saying they’ve always been that way. Games exist because it was another avenue of monetising the digital space. Saying “it’s sad it has come to only getting love if the devs can monetise it” and “all games are that way now unfortunately” is redundant. The only reason the game exists is because some suits determined they could make money from it.

Guild Wars 3: Immortal

&gt; take that one!

Thanks for your reply I'll check this build today.
---
Yes I am using this updated snowscrow build /u/chimaeraUndying
---
Assuming he was originally a human, he was definitely lying about being older than the gods.
---
I stopped. Pug ele with these new instabilities is horrible for the most part.
---
But players cannot even agree on what those issues are. Whatever ANet does to the mode will lead to negative response, and thus disincentivize making changes in the future.
---
Yeah totally forgot about your sigils on the kill, would be interested to see what time you'd get now with right gear and more experience.
---
This is highly conditional on keeping up slow though, IA is a better build to learn instead of Danger Time
---
Daniel was indeed the art guy, I did a thesis on his work for uni. Just wanted to mention it :) 
---
Reminds me of wow waiting for a healer, lol. 
---
As someone told me a few years ago in GW1, come to GW, no waiting for trinity, and I found it very appealing.
---
 Yes a healer makes things smooth, but I rather not wait for a healer, at the off hours I sometimes get on the game.
---
Seems most likely. He's hilarious though. 
---
Yes, it's outdated.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Minor_Sigil_of_Strength
---
You do know their quarterly earnings went up last report, despite it being well past the launch of the most recent expansion, right? And that the studio still employs over 400 people?
---
&gt;There's no context **nor seeming relevance to GW2** so I'm going out on a limb in saying this is malware.
---
You lived on the Moon last weeks , right?
---
Maybe I just need to readjust style.
---
Do you play EU or NA?
---
You havent been around, have you. 
---
I actually started world completion and I'm enjoying myself again!
---
The guide is outdated, as it's 4 years old. [This](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Minor_Sigil_of_Strength) is the current requirement for discovering sigils of strength.
---
I recommend using http://gw2crafts.net/weaponcraft.html instead, as they pull data from the API and so are more likely to be up-to-date.
---
that guide is 4 years old. naturally some things have changed. you are far better off using this site http://gw2crafts.net/weaponcraft.html
---
&gt;   it is probably your buffs and the golems condis 
---
I have just seen the golem has permanent vulnerability on him
---
You don’t discover it if I remember , you just get it when you hit 75 I believe 
---
And Anet is never going to tell you the game is on maintenance mode because they suck at communcation
---
I haven't either. May I ask what's going on here ? 
---
I do not use banner/druid buff nor vulnerability on golem
---
Which is the vast majority, so it would be fine to have both APIs. (like WoW for example.)
---
But there would be an alternative that would work for everyone too, "Vulkan" - same benefits as DX12, no OS limitation - allthough i am not sure if it would run on a decade old gpus that only support DX9 (which currently can run GW2).
---
Yep changed with HOT

Problem is WvW isn't really fun.

So you make a post about the current state of the game. And talk about 30% of it?

I just discovered it, but the materials needed has changed.

"Replicants are like any other machine, are either a benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit it's not my problem."

Thank you for your input, was really helpful.

Considering my commander was referring to Knight armor instead of Soldier, I have a couple of questions:
---
For a backline rev, would you use Knight over Berserk or the other way around?
---
Once that pick is clear, in what situations should I switch to Marauder over one of the above? Or Marauder still more balanced for anytime?
---
Okay I didn't expect that so much work was put into this, respect to this guy ! And thank you again for the link !

Remember that it's opinion.

My opinion on the map is that it's the best yet. The story was better than usual imo too. But I'm not generally impressed by gw2 story so that's not saying a lot.

So don't write it off as the only reason people consider it exceptional. Because that is your opinion.
---
If they dedicate time to optimization instead of new content, I won't play anymore. Sure, the game might run slightly better but who cares about that if there's nothing new to do for long periods of time?
---
Is... this a fetish?

Perfect music for this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vcrb6365GsQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vcrb6365GsQ)

I'm OOL with this ..
---
Is this a DX12 community patch?  what does it provide for the game?
---
https://discretize.eu
---
DH,Slb,Weaver. Pick one and go. 
---
With proper group composition(chrono/druid/bs/2dps or rene/fb/bs/2dps) u shouldnt be worried too much about group survivaebility. Unless you are for example DH, which in some situations can share Aegis/Stability. 
---
For some it probably is but I have been craving my own slave since SWTOR's Vette. 
---
Frames.
---
how much of a difference does a higher essence of gold gives you?
---
I loved Cowboy Bebop
---
I mean this is very well done but i cant take this seriously... looks like some 80ies jeans gangster with blonde hair but then it just has the face of a shark-rat lol
---
1) Guild wars is great for exactly this kind of play. Events scale to the size of the group doing them. Loot drops and chests are all your own. So long as you hit a mob, you get credit for the kill so there is no kill stealing. Now if your friend didn't help, they won't get credit.
---
2) I don't know about the free to play version of the game, but each time I start a brand new character I have the waypoint just outside of each of the 5 major cities. You guys can all choose different races and then meet up at a location of your choosing. If this doesn't work you guys could try and marathon across the lands to one another.
---
3) Party balance doesn't really matter in open world PVE. Each class has the ability to be a support, condition DPS or power dps, its just how you build them. Honestly just tell your friends to pick what sounds fun and if you end up with 5 of the same class, it will still work (This is not necessarily the case in endgame content but you guys just want to have fun and learn right now)
---
4) The closest thing to player housing is a guild hall and that isn't available unless you have the expansions. Even then you dump massive amounts of resources into it to  upgrade it or to decorate it, but at this point that is far far in your futures.
---
5) The Free to play is all of the original release story with some restrictions on some channels, mail, and other conveniences. There is no premium membership, most paid items are entirely cosmetic. The content that is locked behind a paywall is: The story for living world season 2 which bridges the first story to Heart of Thorns, Heart of Thorns expansion has gliding, elite classes, and some new stat sets, Living world season 3 bridges the story between HoT and Path of Fire and contains 6 new maps, Path of Fire expansion contains new elite classes, mounts, and new stat sets, finally living world season 4 is our continuing story and has some new maps.
---
6) I think you can just make a guild so long as you have 1 gold
---
7) Have fun. Follow your nose, get sucked into the events on the map, explore if that's your thing there are many fun surprises hidden in the maps. Don't be in a rush to hit 80. The game has a pretty big difficulty spike when you hit the first expansion so knowing the ins and outs of your character is important. /map chat will be very friendly and answer any questions you might have.
---
They shouldn't be buggy, and that sounds more than just odd...
---
Sorry I'm not sure. I just tried Foxit and that worked for me.
---
If you have Wine installed through Ubuntu Software and you're following the guide, then I don't know what could be wrong.
---
It shouldn't make a difference, but in Steam Settings - Steam Play - you could enable Steam Play for all other titles.
---
Also try running the Steam beta or if you are then the non beta
---
I've installed Guild Wars 2 on a laptop with a pretty new/clean Ubuntu 18.04 install with just Steam and Wine installed and it worked without any issues. Maybe something about your system is messed up.
---
You could try uninstalling Steam - clearing out all the config files / anything related to Steam.
---
Last thing is a fresh install of your OS. Install only the bare minimum - Steam, Wine, and graphics drivers. See if this guide works then finish setting up your system and see if it still works after that.
---
rytlock mount confirmed?
---
You are all going to most likely have different personal story and while you all can join those story instances, doing for example noble human personal story wont progress asura personal story.   
---
For some this might be annoying and problem others might actually enjoy getting to play different stories :)
---
There are always risks with using 3rd party add-ons, but arcdps, taco and are "ok" with anet and abet has worked with the developers to make the add-on T&amp;C compliant.
---
Can't speak for others like mount dial etc that other people mention. Although they are ok to use I personally have not seen a post from anet about them.
---
The people that claim to be banned for using arc and taco, were found to using other stuff too....
---
Just because you can slap a work-around together doesn't mean its a good decision to implement it globally.
---
Its a work around, and as such it is bound to run into issues with compability et.c.
---
So at that point you would basically end up better of rewriting the whole game to support DX12 from scratch, at which point you mas just as well make a new game.
---
1. We do not have traditional questing. You move in a area and a heart pops up with a ping to the right of your window. It will tell you what things you can do in that very area to fill up the bar. The bar is personal and only your contribution counts towards the heart. How ever none of you can steal kill or heart objects from eachother if you hit something and the 4 of you also do they will all get credit. If there is a object you can pick up or activate it will be there for your friend to do too. So everybody have their own progress. 
---
How ever hearts are more of a pointer to the location of the map. What will be important are all the events that you will run in too, this will be your biggest source of xp incom. Hearts usually get done in the process. 
---
The only thing that is important is that you pick the same region when you pick a server. In PvE we have mega servers so only region matters which are NA or EU. If you plan to play world verses world then is is very important that you also pick the same server otherwise you can not play wvw together because there are no mega servers for that.
---
You can play different races and join eachother on any of your starting areas, there is always one waypoint open on each of them. If you party up you can easy get to the other players map. If you are on the same map but can not see eachother then right click one of the people avatar and join their instance. The story you can play together but if you are different races you wont get credit for them except for the instance owner. But you can still join if you want but each person have to make their story step on their own if you are a different race to get credit for it.
---
Party ballance, well there are no holy trinity in this game, at the most we have a soft trinity. There is nothing you can tank in GW2 except some of the bosses in raids. In fractals and dungeons, or world bosses or champs or what ever none of them have aggro management. You have to solve this in another way. With that said you can all play what you want to play the whole thing about GW2 is to share buffs and every class have this except for Necro at least until you get expansions. The most used support as of now in endgame is Firebrand, Druid and Messmer. But whilst leveling up guard, ele and reve can also add heal and buffs but so can others as well so imo pick what you like to play and share the buffs you have. GW2 is very alt friendly so if someone want to play something special at endgame you can make a new character pretty fast. Just enjoy the first play through, there will only be this one time it happen.
---
No real player housing. There are your homeinstance were you can collect gathering nodes and other stuff but up to now there is no real player housing were you can make your own world.
---
Expansions will lift the restrictions you have as f2p. Those restrictions are things such as less bag slots, less character slots, no map chat but you can talk in party chat and also if you make a guild you can ofc talk there too. But no map chat. No sending items from your account to other accounts and so on. But the biggest thing is the restrictions on the trading post and that you can not play reve unless you own a expac. 
---
There are no monthly fee, no vip, no patron no nothing. You buy the game and the season (season can be bought with in game gold) and that is it. You play the game as much as you want. There are also no p2w in the gem store and you can exchange gold to gems without middle hands.
---
To start a guild is super easy. You need one gold and a name and that is it. To upgrade your guild you need the HoT expac the most. This will require a lot of gold and effort such as farming materials and is something you do together and a long term thing. You can decorate your guild hall. There are tons of things to do in it and i guess it is sort of player housing but more of a guild thing.
---
Advice how to level and what to do whilst doing so i have this link to a post i usually post but this one is already to long so i give you the links instead. I also add how our endgame looks like, another wall of text but you learn a lot :)

---
Will just mention as you said possibly more than 5 of you, Dungeons, Fractals and Story instances have a 5 player cap so you may not all quite fit in. However open world is as many players as you can fit in a map and you will get rewards regardless if you are in a party or not. 
---
It does take a gold to make a guild but if you all join and represent (you can join up to 5 guilds at  time on your account) you will be able to see the location of your friends and basically have your own chat room. 
---
Other than that guild wars is super friendly for group play and incredibly chill about stuff for open world in builds and roles and stuff so just pick what sounds the coolest and have fun. :)
---
Dude.... just the vulnerability on golem changes everything..
---
Okay, I'm not going to waste my time trying to make you believe something. Honestly your opinion just isn't worth it. I'm content knowing the truth. That's all that matters.
---
Hey Morn, are you still running the Vabbi metas on weekend nights?
---
Or simply reset the damage for PvP AND WvW instead of trying to invent things that counter and invent other things that counter that and invent things that counter that and in the end everybody have to much of everything. 
---
From what I saw by reading all your comments, it questions myself if you are not quite dumb..
---
So, you dont use food, no scholar runes, no proper buffs nor golem vulnerability and you want to hit the benchmarks?????
---
I absolutely love it! Good job 
---
One of the most tasteful ones I have ever seen, imo. Great job! 
---
Plains of Eidolon and Fortuna Borealis seems like WF versions LS episodes. Not played personally but they looks like big maps.
---
100% pugged from T1 to 50kp+ CMs. Got Ad Infinitum along the way too. It's just about persistence. 
---
This is the kind of guy who would've shot first
---
Hello and welcome to Tyria!
---
1. Quests in this game (hearts) are not like in other MMO's, you don't have to accept it somewhere - you just go to the area and it appears. Progress is not shared between party members, but in some quests you can cheese some objects to spawn multiples of the same mob - one person spawns, everyone hits it, you kill it, another person spawns new one. Everyone who hit it will get kill exp, loot and quest progress.
---
2. There are several waypoints (teleports) available, so there is no problem meeting everyone right after you finish your intro.
---
3. Basically, you can play whatever you want, as all classes can do pretty much everything - there is no division for tanks, damage dealers and healers, at least before level 80.
---
There are elite specializations available in expansions, for example your Ranger can become Druid, who is the healest healer on the game.
---
If you want to plan ahead you can check metabattle.com for builds to see what each class can do best at level 80.
---
4. Every person has his own home instance, which is basically a small district in their race's town. As you progress through the game, you can get nodes with various materials to collect daily.
---
5. There is no Premium stuff after you buy expansions, but you might consider buying Living Story seasons,if you want to access some new maps (seasons 3 and 4, season 2 doesn't bring new maps) and story. If you continue playing, you can get every next episode for free just by entering the game - the latest is Season 4 Episode 5 which you'll get right now!
---
Also there are cosmetics you can buy with gems (paid currency), but you can also convert gold to gems, although it is quite a bit of gold you'll need.
---
6. As far as I know you only need 1 gold to start a guild and that's it. As your guild grows you can do different upgrades and at some point buy a Guild Hall.
---
7. The best advice is to have fun and do whatever interests you. You'll get to level 80 in no time compared to other games and its only horizontal progression from there. 
---
awww, that's sweet gratz! :)
---
If its not this im going to cry
---
Thank you ! It was really fun to create it !
---
RIBA.
---
This is purely academical of course but you can't do something like this in a vacuum and expect good balance. All you will see is ranked dominated by the few classes that have good core builds which through core trait lines powercreep have matched PoF levels of powercreep. So core Guard, core Thief, maybe at a stretch core Ranger and Warrior. The rest will suck balls, Rev as a class would be effectively deleted from PvP since it's practically designed to function with elite specs. 
---
The big ones are GPU offload, which allows you to better utilize your GPU capabilities. The other is a major rewrite of the API implementation which grants less overhead on draw calls to the GPU, giving better frame times overall. 
---
have you been taking your pills lately?
---
I need your help once again.I just started playing and got a black lion chest key as a drop.I am only level 8 at the moment.Is it worth it to use it now or should I wait it out?
---
it seems that steam had an update of Proton in the queue and now the programs start. lets see where this takes me.
---
IMO the most efficient is to do your Daily Istan, Daily Fractals and then farm Silverwastes. Depending on what you need that 300g for, it may be more beneficial to add other farms in there before Silverwastes, but for simplicity's sake that's what I'd say. 
---
That would be a funny April Fools joke: all mounts transform into Rytlocks
---
#RIDE ME DADDY
---
Yeah, i know the ones. It's a pretty penny if you wait for the right one though. (assuming you collect Pact Scout's Mapping Materials)
---
Iirc you'll get the same drops as you would at 80. Look into what skins are possible from the chest, and open it based off of that. You probably won't get one at all, but thems the ropes.
---
I wasn't aware that it was that popular. Must have missed it completely, but then again, I don't exactly lurk the reddit daily. 
---
I agree though with what you said, Mordremoth was on an entirely different level. For one he had a lot more time to 'worm his way in' when it comes to influencing Sylvari. Furthermore, it would be hardly a heroic/nice thing to do for Aurene to "take over" Caithe, and I imagine such a thing would be a rather brutal mood whiplash for a lot of players. 
---
That said, there is a way that such a thing could happen, without going full on body-snatcher, if they go for a 'merge'. Although far as I recall, there is no real precedent in the story for that. Though that doesn't mean that they can't make one now. 
---
Part of the theme after all seems to be that "shit's falling apart".
---
How about "do anything to the engine"? I don't remember a single performance enhancement in its entire lifetime.
---
Oh how much I am looking forward to such a thing. The suspense right now is killing me. 
---
GPU offload of what? 
---
I did a GPU offload on shader variables copy. Any more things?
---
Less overhead on draw calls is also done: overhead on API is up to 70% less.
---
Is this native enough DX12 implementation? =]
---
Just googled the hidden room thing. Wow.
---
&gt;It 8s an add on 
---
I think your autocorrect 8 some letters.
---
Shouldn't be talking about back-seat devs in a post that implies devs responsible for "content" are working on the engine. Other than that, this post gets a whole lot of "citation needed."
---
Because any such comment is seen as an endorsement. Companies tend to be careful about that, for obvious reasons.
---
The new SA is actually *fun.*  Birds is annoying as hell.  Stick Together punishes anyone who gets left behind and gives no one an incentive to go back for them.  
---
The creator of d912pxy said this in the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ak0mqs/d912pxy_directx12_for_guild_wars_2/):
---
&gt;Overall performance boost based on test data sets is 33.8%, ingame it's ~20% boost for max FPS and ~200% boost for min FPS in high draw call load conditions.
---
Of course it's going to depend on your rig etc.
---
It feels like there's a high incidence of instability repeats across fractals every day - if one has Birds it feels like most of them do; if one has Fragility you just know you're going to be stuck with it again on another.  There are more instabilities now but it seems like we see *less* of them.
---
I know some of that is confirmation bias - remembering the really annoying ones - but Birds is *really* annoying and seeing it in more than one fractal a day quickly became tiresome.  There's enough instabilities that it should be possible to do dailies without any repeats.
---
It could have been about dx11 indeed. It's been a while ago. General idea is still there, people wanted to utilize their hardware and anet offered nothing, even stating it wouldnt help.
---
All I can say is don't worry about leveling as fast as you can to 80. The journey there is very fun and you'll see some very beautiful areas as you adventure around Tyria. Experiment with different builds as you go along; see how certain skills synergize with certain traits in your specializations. Once you feel pretty confident with your style, look at what the elite specializations offer in the expansions. Also remember that the expansions/living world zones are even prettier and more complex than the base game zones. Well worth the price in my opinion. And you can get a lot of them in bundles. 
---
Always remember.
---
Oh lol I didn't realise you're the guy who did this!
---
Yes of course it is native enough. I was just simply talking about the general features of DX12, as in explaining what things come with it, not realizing who I was talking to. You know better than me, so I'm sorry if I came off as bashing your outstanding work.
---
Too many comments here are pushing the tired old *'GW2s engine is bad because it was based on the GW1 engine'* myth.
---
There is an excellent explanation from almost two decades ago why that makes no sense at all:
---
https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/
---
instabilities are not challenge, are annoyance and you will find hardcores who agree with this statement.
---
or I can stop playing, my old crew was the reason I didn't left during HoT so I'm not going to force myself into new relationships
---
[Rytlock springer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfbKaElB_4U) would be great but plz no to [Kasmeeraptor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp0xxP5zmEc) D:
---
the enemy birds should just switch to friendly/minion type after dodging, easy fix. tho i dont mind them as they are now
---
sounds tasty though
---
I play in windowed mode but the title bar of the error log window is still popping up occasionally.
---
Actually it slightly lowers my FPS because of the extra CPU load (I have a quad core i5-6600) but the game doesn't have annoying microstutters anymore.
---
Do you have your current .dat file? 
---
Patching and latency will be your biggest troubles in general. I haven't really noticed the client using much bandwidth once in game.
---
Facking finally!
---
I miss my 1st printscreen in at least sabetha, slothsaur or wth is named and cairn because I forgot I was using this and printscreened my way to a crash... 5 times now! 
---
This tool is the best, even allowed me to do raids rotations with almost 0 latency, but the printscreen crash was kind of ugly. Thz for having those working now :)
---
oh, here we go again. even though i'm complimenting your work, you can't accept that it's not the same thing and take it as a personal attack.  
---
i'm quite done with your attitude at this point.
---
Indeed. I like the more consistent framerate and mainly stutter-free gameplay but I also like how *c i n e m a t i c* my game looks with gw2hook :/ https://imgur.com/a/lBHbzdR
---
100% Shadowrun
---
Well you'd have to uproot a lot to be able to backtrack to a point where Balthazar would have been our ally. Kralk wouldn't have become superpowered, Joko wouldn't be dead, and (depending on *WHEN* you sway Balthazar) we wouldn't have needed to destroy the original dragonsblood spear. If we had gotten him to listen early on enough, maybe even Vlast could have survived.
---
But just the fact that Balthazar is implied to have Kralkatorrik on the verge of defeat at the end of PoF, I would assume we would have definitely been able to end him if Balthazar hadn't been so set in his ways.
---
Though, we also thought we had Kralk defeated in All or Nothing. So maybe he's more resilient than even Balthazar gave him credit for.
---
Updating is not a problem i can just go to my friend and he has a decent internet so i only care about client  bandwidth 
---
&gt; why doesnt Anet pursue this option
---
it's not stable.  
---
a 3rd party developer doesn't have to make sure his release is bug-free in the same way Anet does.  
---
  
---
if they were to re-write code to make it run on DX12 natively, the minimal (though important) gain in fps would not be worth all the work needed to make sure it runs stable on multiple hardware and software configurations.  
---
pips in eotm
---
&gt;I don't know about the free to play version of the game, but each time I start a brand new character I have the waypoint just outside of each of the 5 major cities.
---
This was actually added specifically for F2P players. Before the base game went F2P, you had to travel through the Lion's Arch Asura Gate hub to meet up. Because F2P players can't enter Lion's Arch until level 30-ish, they made these waypoints automatically unlock.
---
So you believe in his good side?
---
This has been theorized before. And the biggest issue people point out is that Caithe is clearly shown losing her branded features, signifying that Aurene is well and truly dead, and her connection severed from Caithe.
---
When Caithe says "She's gone," that wasn't just her confirming Aurene's physical death. That's her way of saying "I can't even feel her anymore."
---
So if Aurene does come back, I definitely believe she will reconnect with Caithe (assuming Caithe survives that long). But I don't think Aurene will come back *as a result* of her connection with Caithe.
---
Well, just dodge once to get rid of it? It's really not that bad imo ^^
---
According to Glasswire, GW2 has used 150 megs of bandwidth over the past month.  I only play a couple of hours a day at this point, but even when I binged, just running the game doesn't use much bandwidth or transfer much data.  Game updates can use quite a bit more, and downloading the game client itself (around 40 gigs) would be a huge hit, but day-to-day usage is minimal.
---
My current use pattern on my PC is locally stored media, mostly reddit and wikis in my web browser, and maybe 4-5 hours of gaming a night, split between Warframe and GW2 - in the past month GW2 has used 150 megs and Warframe is about tied with Chrome at just under 500 megs each.
---
So as a data cap, 18 gigs is fine - you're at a much, much, much bigger risk of blowing through it with streaming audio and video.
---
As stated elsewhere in this thread, latency will probably be a bigger issue than data use.
---
&gt; Or are you ANET SHILLS?????
---
No, everybody in this thread is just making fun of you because your post because you're acting like a damn brat about what is essentially your own failure to exercise critical thinking skills and generally not be a moron.
---
You can't expect people to take you seriously when you can't even respond to a single comment without throwing a temper tantrum and screaming and insulting people. You react like a child, you get treated like a child. You fall for a scam targeted specifically towards idiots, you get scammed. Shit happens.
---
The game doesn't suddenly suck just because you're not observant enough to *not* fall for obvious scams. I don't know what you're going for with this post but I would say you didn't accomplish any of your goals unless one of them was to make yourself look like a petulant child and spew shit all over everyone while they make fun of you, lol.
---
Lol damn, I sure hope I don't run into you anytime soon big guy.
---
1. yes
---
2. every new character automatically has a waypoint in each beginner area, so you can teleport there
---
3. literally, everyone can run dps, and you'll be FINE
---
4. no
---
5. there's no premium membership, but the story content that gets released between expansions (Living Story or LS) is only free until the next episode of it or xpac gets released
---
6. only requirement to make a guild is a tiny bit of gold
---
There is a big sale during the month of March every year. Wait if you can-basically everything goes on sale.
---
I asked a question, because i'm very interested on possible improvements. Not "generic" statements. Maybe you know something important that i don't, who knows?
---
And for very buggy: you are welcome to post issues on github. No offence, maybe if you say that it very buggy, you have something big to report.
---
hot
---
Well with usb tether  i get 88 ping in LA.
---
It's fine, i just asking around, maybe someone know this theme more then i.
---
Unfortunately I'm not much help, just know the bullet points from when the API was released, alongside with Vulkan, but the specifics on how to do stuff is beyond what I know. 
---
But keep up the amazing work! Still hasn't gotten around installing it due to unstable overclock in my system that I'm still nailing down, but I will once I'm able to!
---
I'd like to add some thoughts about the way quests work, because reading the developer's reasoning behind the design really made me appreciate it more.
---
One of the core ideas in GW2's design was that you don't have to pick up a quest from an NPC, kill x things, and then hand the quest in for a reward. The developers wanted a more organic experience. So instead you will find a village that's under attack by centaurs and you're immediately drawn to help. If you fail, you may find that the whole village is now on fire and you may need to help put out the fires and gather supplies to rebuild. If you'd succeeded defending the village initially, the villagers might send someone sabotage the centaur camps to ward off further attacks.
---
The yellow hearts were added later into development as a way of guiding players towards these dynamic events. The yellow hearts are static quests that are always available and keep players sticking around places where these dynamic events are most likely to occur.
---
I feel like completionists (like myself) sometimes forget that these events are where the game really shines. It's where the game comes alive and where the player is actively drawn into the story and the world.
---
Since you're a group of friends, you're going to have the ideal circumstances to really experience the game the way it's designed to. I hope you'll let the game steer you away from your objectives and entice you into experiencing new, unexpected adventures!
---
Above all else; have fun! 
---
You won't belive the number of players who DO care about wvw.
---
&gt;You can do them with friends (be sure to be in the same map when you launch the instance) but if you do so, your friend will have the same "personnal" story than you.
---
Note that you can tag along with your friends personal story, but it doesn't count for your personal story completion, and vice versa. You'll get experience point rewards for killing off monsters and what-not in the story, but only the person whose story it is gets the reward-y stuff for *completing it*. On the plus side, this means you can tag along with a friend and experience their story, then they can tag along with yours to see it too.
---
If you're playing the same race and make the same choices at character creation (so you'd have the same personal story) as a friend, and then play their story, does anyone know if that counts as completion for both?
---
I'd say Duel/Illu boon chrono with Diviner's gear/Pack runes/Force+Impact, not really a DPS but you'll have your own fury/might/vigor, party-wide quickness/alacrity which obviously helps a ton.
---
For quick fights replace Improved Alacrity for Danger Time and drop 1 utility skill for Disenchanter and just CS on ether aftercast as if you were a dps, can usually get 15-20k dps while being boon chrono.
---
So I'm a returning player and I just wrapped up with all of the story missions, what's the best way to make money? I want me a griffon
---
If Balthasar wasn't powerful enough to challenge Kralkatorrik, then there wouldn't have been a threat at the end of PoF. In my opinion, the human gods vs dragons would be a close fight, possibly in fabour of the gods. But I feel like there are so many variables, that anything the plot demands can  happen.
---
You can bet your ass it'll never happen.
---
i would love to have the pvp build thingy in wvw
---
done that, found approximately 12GB of data - some of which was guild wars files and some werent. Disabled firewall doesnt seem to have done anything. The number of files remaining left to download still hasnt gone down
---
so, i guess the "salt" is for when you get back and your keeps gone.
---
No problem! If you want to see what past year's sales were like: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem_Store/March_Sale
---
Thanks 
---
Coming to the game? Absolutely. Just this past month 2 of my friends have started the game for the first time and are loving it. The world's are always filled players too. 
---
Hey, I did that while I was at rehab. With 4g I had a ping of 50.and consumption was about 1gb for 3h of pve raid with discord. And occasional tabbing out. Iirc the client takes about 150kbit/s
---
Why upgrade to something i don't need? everything i have works fantastic on win7. and windows 7 doesn't come pre-installed with a plethora of data mining bs.
---
Also, just FYI, August is the other huge sale month (to celebrate the game's anniversary)
---
Playing a dedicated support build in normal gameplay is quite bad because you can't kill anything on your own. It's only good in endgame group content and maybe dungeons.
---
&gt;No, the biggest problem is that investing in optimization removed dev time for content
---
This isn't true at all. Dev's responsible for content are designers, Dev's doing engine work are actual developers/programmers.
---
The only overlap is when the designers want to implement something requiring new tech such as all the recent movement handling, showing NPC's as different things to different people, mounts etc. Then the developers adapt the engine to enable such things and then have to update their in house development tools to allow their designers to implement them in their workflow.
---
The cost in investing in optimisation would require hiring new programmers who then have to learn anets tools, development history etc before they can even begin work identifying areas to improve. Even without a large scale engine rework this is something anet should be doing though because it's a terrible idea to only have a couple key figures understand how your system works.
---
In the past any content drought was because of anets self admitted tendency to throw out all the work done and start from scratch butting up with their poor project management dealing with their idea for the living world.
---
I'll find a party
---
I would be happy with instabilities if I also earn roughly ~10-20 gold per hour. I would just stay in WvW the entire time except for map completion. Right now I do fractals because that's the only way for me to get decent gold.
---
Which boy band is he in?
---
"If anyone plays the game except for wvw."
---
Wvw is pretty dead compared to PvE.  PvE has tons of people.
---
See? Sci-fi Guild Wars would totally work. Now give me a Charr space marine! 
---
Tbh the Skipping part ist the most disgusting thing to do with a Class that has no access to stealth. Especially after that cave there will be Snipers that oneshot you :D
---
Maybe try to get consumables that grant Stealth and increase your Movementspeed? Or try to switch to Thief/Mesmer since those have a huge amount of Stealth.
---
Griffon is a waste of money confirmed (circa 2019)
---
&gt;instead of that speedrun mentality
---
Despite your anti-speedrun mentality, you don't kill mobs after Belka because they respawn, as you've noticed. Use consumables, teleports, stunbreak, condi cleanse, etc, and skip them.
---
Firebrand is the swiss army knife support.
---
Haha it was just yesterday I read your installation for your preset, sadly it didn't really work since I got all yellow errors.
---
Except skimmer, it just feels dull. Going over the water is fine, but once you hit some dirt it feels like you hit the wall. As you suffer from speed, also it's special ability also questionable. In my opinion skimmer needs love. 
---
I do get the errors too (even with the original preset) but I just click the error log away lol
---
Bit of an unorthodox one but Scourge (Necromancer Spec) is a pretty nice support/dps hybrid. It supports via barrier, rez ability, and condition cleanses mostly. As for debuffs it's main focus is applying an array of damaging/debuffing conditions with the unique skill 'Epidemic', that allows them to spread these conditions to multiple targets in a large AoE.
---
Gw2 in general is ahead of competition in terms of movement gameplay.
---
Idk leveling up all the way to 80 never bothered me because then you have map exploration and HP trains to start to kind of get the class and whenever you're farming Istan or dragon stand you can play on that character instead since it isnt very punishing to play poorly to start to actually enjoy the class 
---
Wow,nice to hear guess Imma buy the expansions.Thanks.
---
I can only imagine how the tattoo parlor felt: "Challenge accepted."
---
It's my perspective of what I do in the game and what I enjoy. It's also about the future of the game.
---
As someone who only recently switched to Windows 10 (and only because I had to; I upgraded to a Ryzen 2600x and they don't officially support Windows 7) there are a couple reasons: 1) I had an awful experience when I tried it a few years back during the free trial 2) the only real "incentive" to upgrade was access to DX12, but pretty much no game up until now saw any real performance increases from DX11 to 12, so I saw no reason to upgrade. Add to that all the things you hear/heard about Microsoft gathering your data and well, it didn't really seem that enticing.
---
It feels like it would benefit from a short grace period so that running over a small island wasn't such a pain.
---
###Active Defense
---
------------------------------
---
GW2 is not a game where you just tank and soak up the damage from enemies and heal through it. It is more like Dark Souls or Legend of Zelda where you avoid and dodge damage. So defense in this game is Active rather than just passive have better stats.
---
* Walk away from damage. If there are red or orange circles on the ground it's probably a bad idea to stay in them.
---
* Dodge. You can dodge in 4 directions to get out the way of attacks. (It is recommended to turn off "Double tap to dodge" and bind it to a single key. Makes you less likely to fall off cliffs.)
---
* Dodge Through. When you dodge you are invincible from damage. So instead of dodge away, you just dodge when the attack occurs with invincibility frames.
---
* Block. Some weapons and skills will Block. They will take the hit and you have zero damage. (Shields and Maces often Block.)
---
* Evade. Some weapons and skills will allow you to Evade an attack. This is the same as dodging. E.g. 
---
* Reposition yourself with a skill. Many skills will move your character. They may make you jump forward or backward. Use them for their movement to just avoid the attack. Often these skills will Evade as well.
---
* Blind (white eye on red background). The status condition Blind will make the target Miss one attack. If you see them starting a big attack: Blind, then they Miss.
---
* Aegis (yellow shield). This Boon will block 1 attack perfectly. If you see a big attack, get Aegis.
---
They all have unique movement abilities as well as weight behind them. They don’t feel like a shiny speed boost but more like an actual animal. Everything from that to the animations and usefulness of each really ties it all together well! For a game that swore early it would never have mounts, they made probably the best mmo mounts around!
---
this asura slaps your healer ass,  what you do? 
---
I didn't see that info anywhere, when the internet said it was soloable for everyone. Thank you!
---
I didn't know it had to be skipped XD I thought I could slowly fight my way through it all.
---
Is that possible in any of the other paths, or do I have to buy stealth-consumables and do path 2? :)
---
Yes, it does.  I specifically created a character the same race as my mom when she started so we could do this and we were able to do level 1-30 story content together and both get credit for it. 
---
You're right. [Those](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/db/2a/a9/db2aa9489ff2aedfcff12a852cb82c7d.jpg) are a lot better.
---
The pay-to-win part was said ironically :D I remember there was a string of threads on the forums about how GW2 was pay to win because of the paid expansions.
---
DON'T TAKE THAT PART SERIOUSLY FUTURE READERS.
---
Being a 3d model makes this even more amazing. Really well done! 
---
The truth is that we don't know and we *can't* know until ArenaNet decide to tell us their stance, or until they take action.
---
Underrated 😁
---
Domain of istan daily chests, silverwastes RIBA farming, fractals, raids. Easiest one atm is to buy divine lucky envelopes and sell them on ge. 
---
Says he's doing all the same shit &gt; misses half the shit ...
---
Just wait until you can fly Aurene!!
---
4) Clarity. Even without expansions you do get a Guild Hall in Lion's Arch (main hub city). If you make a guild and upgrade it, the upgrades will appear in the [Guild Initiative Headquarters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vYWUWxZuVM)
---
I'd recommend watching a video of another p2 solo, just to see the ideal path and things you might overlook. 
---
Something I haven't seen mentioned already:
---
While you can do story instances together as a party, you said you +5 friends. All party content in GW2 is for 5 people (Dungeon, Fractals (something similar to dungeons) and story). Only raids would be for more (10 people).
---
So while technically you can do the story together with your friends, if you have different races you can't do the first 30 level together and even later story steps might be a problem because you can make decisions where the story branches a little bit and it would only make sense if your friends made the same choices then. And even if you all play the same race with the same decisions you can only do it as a group with 5 people.
---
NO they DON't ban players because of one report 
---
Okay thank you for the input! I think since it's been so long since I've actively sat down and played I'm going to start fresh from 1 on a Necromancer and see where that takes me. 
---
Your can have your opinion, even if it is hateful, rude and crass.  I'll bet your are an Anet shill
---
Skimmers should have been adapted for gliding in updrafts and ley lines too. Would make them more useful, and also give us an excuse to have gliding back.
---
While the above post is very true, also bear in mind that your individual personal story does not bear much relevance in overall game. And individual stories are very much solo-ble content as well, in case one of you want to choose a different path for later. 
---
Oh by the way, reported to Reddit for targeted harassment.
---
If it didn't fail so bad at content and replayability, GW2 would easily best the rest of the top MMOs.
---
Jackal and Raptor do have different niches. Jackal is a little more manueverable, but the big thing is that jackal goes uphill much faster than raptors, while raptor goes slightly faster on flat or downhill terrain.
---
Raptor is basically budget Roller Beetle for people who don't want to do its scavenger hunt. It performs better over flattish terrain, whereas the jackal outperforms it over hilly terrain, as the jackal's blink works seamlessly uphill, whereas the raptor longjump stops short going uphill. 
---
I did only find 1 or 2 and they were thieves, so I skipped them because of the stealth. But you make a point with the path. Plus, I just bought a lot of harpy feathers so stealthing through the nescessary paths should be doable now.
---
Thanks, I'll look for it.
---
Guild Wars 2 engine make it possible for the devs to come up with these types of movement abilities. 
---
The game engine of most other MMO's will not be able to handle these type of movements that is why we don't see these type of mounts in other MMO's.
---
&gt; It is relevant for other multiboxers who do their dailies in custom arenas. Their policy explicitly state they will allow multiboxing in custom arenas when that is not a reality.
---
They only stated that you are allowed to log into multiple accounts in custom arenas, not that you are allowed to use 3rd party apps in there while doing so.
---
Wistworn.......thats YOUR OPINION, nothing more.  I am not a troll (BTW using "fucking" in map chat gets you suspended).  Just because I say something that doesn't fall in step with your narrow minded opinion doesn't mean that I am a troll.  God you sound just like a progressive socialist snowflake crying and whining cause you got triggered.  Must be sad to go through like with such a closed mind.  Grow up 
---
One of the current issues is that textures load in a weird and delayed way. For me the first 30 seconds in a new area has missing textures until it all catches up.
---
Spoiler in title
---
It all startet when I was 12...
---
No, but it started with a comment, where I said that most connection problems are not on the server side. 
---
Well, OP answered me and I tried to explain the problem more accurate, because I thought he is interested in knowing the reason behind it. 
---
But he didn't understand, torn my sentenced, responded on out-of-context quotes and I didn't know if he just didn't understand what I wrote or if he did that intended to have a confirmation that he's right. 
---
And I think it's normal to get angry, when someone rip your statemant apart and give it a completely different meaning. 
---
However I still tried to explain it. Idk I think I just don't like it, when ppl complain about things that's not true / blame ppl for thing that's not their fault. Often ppl understand, when I explain it. :)
---
Vigil light chest? xD
---
Awesome artwork.
---
in the vacuum of pvp, which you are abviously talking about, i would explain it with the amount of dipshits frequently abusing the reporting system.
---
the 2018 hacker ban was not the result of Anet investigating, they included spyware in a game update that reported back if any player was running certain processes on their computers that indicated third party hacker software.
---
I think this was important, they said they wouldn't do mounts with us imagining the existing system, they re-invented mounts and blew it out the water and they did it there way
---
&gt; But I'm not going to give you personal information and say that I am a design Engineer and work daily with partial diff equations.
---
Lmao, congratulations? I would hate to be so insecure that I felt the need to post a sentence like this as if anybody on the internet gave a fuck what I do in my free time.
---
I'm not triggered, I was just (originally) trying to explain to you that people can be pissed at what you're saying for reasons other than "ANET SHILLS". People are pissed at what you're saying because you articulate yourself as if you haven't finished grade school yet.
---
I'm not close-minded just because I refuse to take someone seriously when they can't manage to do simple things like form a single complete sentence or stop themselves from throwing a tantrum when someone says something mean to them.
---
Yeah, I will probably have 250g somewhere around 2022.
---
[dO yOu GuYs NoT hAvE pHoNeS?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly10r6m_-n8)
---
Thats not what Im talking about. They claimed they investigated banned accounts and that they do not accept appeals. They were so full of himself at that time it was disgusting. Recently some of banned people came back and show us emails they received, where anet admitted their mistakes and bribes them with gems. There is no reason to believe in any anet claim about reports and bans. They are confirmed liars.
---
Considering what information we have at hand, this theory is VERY GOOD imo.
---
Aurene knows that she needs to die. She SAW it. Her death needed to happen for whatever continuity where kralkitorik is defeated. Kralkitorik needed to kill her, or he would keep looking into the future for timelines where she arrived to stop him. If Aurene created a dummy for Kralk to kill, then Kralk would kill the dummy, and stop looking into futures where the commander and Aurene tried to kill them(maybe?). That way we can strike with Kralk without having to worry about his future sight, since he won't think to use it until we're already there. I mean, If we're making some assumptions about kralk's thought process and capabilities of foresight, this is a very nice theory.
---
&gt; This is why I'll never trust this company ~~ with 3rd party tools. Even wit those they allowed.~~
---
fixed it for you
---
Definetly had Rutger Hauer in mind, yeah.
---
I think most mmos these days are facing that issue. Even the goliath that is WoW.
---
The journals gotten from Bloodstone Fen, Kassandra, Valis, and Bauer, is there any reason to keep the incomplete versions? Or for that matter, the complete versions? I'm not exactly rich enough to have a surplus of bank space, and this is taking up 6 slots.
---
Dang, is it that hard/expensive to get? I just hit lvl 80 and grabbed the raptor from PoF prologue mission but I really wanna get the other mounts too within resonable timeframe.
---
&gt; I know you are a troll and i have you on the ignore list but i will answer anyway.
---
Since you are not ignoring me even though i am on your ignore list, chances are, I am no troll either.
---
&gt; I dont use any 3rd party apps to alter my game in any way
---
Sure, I just take your word on that, after Anet banned you for using 3rd party apps.
---
&gt;  i can play the game perfectly fine without breaking the rules
---
As it was already documented in the other post you made yesterday, it wasnt the first time you broke the rules, so your self-awareness seems to be a bit out of whack here.
---
&gt; Why would i risk losing access or potentionally access indefinately to something i spent alot of time and money on.
---
because you are not the buffest pug
---
&gt; You can see in the video that i am manually controlling my accounts.
---
You seem to be under the firm conviction that you got banned for this very instance and not something you have done 1 day, a week or a month ago.
---
Didn't you create basically the same post earlier today? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ap201k/anets_support_has_really_deteriorated_and_is/
---
Have you multiboxed in a normal pvp match before?
---
Do it the other way around. Dodges are crucial, vigor has been nerfed what, twice already? None of the more important fractals have been updated to not be "use every dodge as we intended or you're fucked". Spawn the birds, let them fly around and aggro randomly. With "afflicted" or "outflanked" and all the other crap we have it's hassle enough.
---
25g each for items from heart vendors(2 each map,10 items total) you can buy them  whenever you have 25g.

---
 as far as gold you can make 20g hr doing Silverwastes with a squad(there's usually a squad in LFG)
---
It's only 250g and the collection can be completed in a day or two, you can easily and casually get 250g in two weeks 
---
Thanks, saving that guide for later
---
This is it, and that sense of weight and motion is the key. Mounts in GW2 take time to accelerate and decelerate, which gives them the feel of a real animal. Mounts in WoW and ESO have the same motional pace as your character, so it feels less like you're riding an animal and more like you're just moving faster.
---
I returned about 6 weeks ago or so and after re-learning the game I was able to get enough cash to make an ascended weapon, fix my gear, buy the griffon, buy the commander tag, and I still have 200g. I pretty much do metas and other events. Basically from savaging and selling everything. Do the dailys to get the rewards.
---
Suit yourself mate; it's your loss.
---
You have to wait for the shaders to compile. It should be quicker on future loads.
---
That never stopped them from doing really bad _obvious_ decisions. TO and Observatory were hell with bad pugs before, so people were skipping it. Did anything get fixed? Naaaw. 
---
With extra punishing instabilities they're even worse. Statics will deal with it, pugs will take 2+ hours to complete t4 with 10+ wipes which I think is the whole point of these changes. 
---
Pugs got too efficient at normal t4s (except for toxic trail + social awkwardness, where they'd skip it or give bad headache to druid) so they have to add ridiculous combos to bring it back to "beat your head against non-solo content, waste an hour, get no reward, we're just trying to teach you to be better" :P
---
Oh my god I totally needed this, thank you
---
So as others mentioned, weapon based skills are different for each class.
---
For your initial question : elites can change the gameplay of a class quite a lot
---
And about your concern about "losing progress by switching to another class" : as long as you keep the Charakter there ist nothing lost ;) I myself got stuck in engineer and had my self forcing me to keep playing. After level 60 I tried guarding and had a blast, pushed through and had real fun in this game for the first time! 6 years later and I have every class maxed, switch between guardian, ranger and necro for the most part and play every other class if I feel like it.
---
So don't be afraid to "risk" a fresh start with another class ;) espacially since most progress is accountbound in GW2 
---
Remember that the game was launched without any elite specs.  In both PvE and PvP, the overwhelming majority of builds now use an elite specialization, but a class is meant to feel whole without one.
---
How much an elite specialization changes the gameplay of the class depends on the specialization.  Some elite specializations like Tempest (Elementalist spec) feel like an upgrade over the base class, but don't fundamentally change the feel of the class. Some specs like Reaper (Necromancer Spec) give the class new tools that change the overall flow of the class, but keep its core elements.  And other specs flip the entire class on its head and give the class an entirely new playstyle, like Weaver (Elementalist Spec).  For the most part, the majority of Heart of Thorns specs tend to feel like upgrades over the base class, and the majority of Path of Fire specs tend to warp the class into a different playstyle.
---
Because you brought up that you're playing Guardian, I'll discuss its two specs.  I would put Dragonhunter in the first category, it feels like a better Guardian.  Its new traps are incredibly fun, and Longbow is decent for open world solo PvE content, but overall it still feels like Guardian with some new tools. However, I personally don't enjoy core Guardian much but I really enjoy Dragonhunter; I hate Guardian's utility skill choices and Dragonhunter helps fill the slots with fun and interesting skills.
---
On the other hand, Firebrand flips Guardian on its head, probably moreso than any other spec in the game. Its tomes give it TONS of new skills to learn. Core Guardian (and Dragonhunter) tends to be played as a Power-based class, while Firebrand is either Condition based or runs a support build.
---
For necro it goes from hitting like a wet noodle to ultimate powerhouse.
---
Some pieces of armor, usually ones with particle effects won't dye properly if your video settings are too low. Try turning your shaders and animations to high and see if that changes anything. Though I'm not sure why toggling your helm would change the gloves in any way.
---
Tbh, the story shouldnt have required playing the last story dungeon, or it should have required playing all of them....
---
At least potentially non-consensual.  Glint clearly seems pretty happy to be helping.
---
Ah so you have personal experience on this case? That changes things. Sorry i was just thinking maybe it is one of those cases ppl love to have a justice boner for no reason.
---
I agree in principle with the idea that death must have consequences, etc.
---
The problem in this particular case is that the way they have set things up if Aurene doesn't come back, or if she does remain dead if her death doesn't in some way *directly contribute* to the defeat of Kralkatorrik, then it's just bad writing. You can't set up a character in the way they have and have so much center around that character as being key to everything the way they have and then suddenly just have the character die and have all of that lead nowhere. I have heard people say that it wouldn't lead nowhere if it contributed to the Commander's growth but... no, that wouldn't be enough. Not the way they've done it so far.
---
One of the guys who worked on Star Trek III: The Search for Spock has talked about how they couldn't have a movie called "The Search for Spock" and then at the end of the film have Captain Kirk turn to the screen and say, "sorry; we didn't find him." If you make the plot of the movie be about going off trying to bring Spock back from the dead, you have to have them actually succeed in the end. It may be realistic and true to life to do that: sometimes in life we work and hope and center ourselves for years for something and it turns out to be for naught. However, even if true to *life* it's bad drama. Lot's of things are true to life but bad for fiction.
---
In writing and drama, there's a concept called Chekov's gun. It basically says that if you hang a gun on the wall in the middle of the stage in act I, somebody has to fire it by act V. Aurene being the key to winning this thing is Chekov's gun. It's just been on that wall as a backdrop for everything for far, far too long to just have it end and that's that.
---
Why does it being team 2's matter?
---
I find it funny that people here say that so much, when in my opinion Guild Wars 2 is really, really strong in terms of content right now. 
---
Welcome to the game! Tybalt, introduction please.
---
Yes, commander
---
Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:

* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
i obviously don't get paid for looking into such peculiar cases, and since there were events going on i only invested so much time. however i have some experience with multiboxing myself, and what i saw was not conclusive of OPs innocence.
---
Doubt will have a gw3 when living world season 1 isnt in the game.
---
I dont contest the fact my accounts may have been investigated previs days, i get mass reported by people everyday, i have people type my guild tag in metas telling people to report me.
---
Lets say i have been investigated, why was i then suspended today for something that is not even prohibited, if i used 3rd party tools or anything of such sorts (which i have never done) wouldnt they ban me then. 
---
To me, it seems this GM investigated me today (this is the same GM who initiated my old suspension) he/she sees i am responsive during the meta event and have no authority to suspend me. 
---
I continue with my day and he/she continues monitoring me and when i do my daily in the custom arena he/she suspends me and justifies the suspension with it.
---
Nothing i do during the tangled depths meta breaches the policy, i am responsive to the teleportation (this happened when the meta wasnt goin on, i was waiting like everyone else in a neautral area with no monsters) And i was doing the mechanics of the fight, hitting the boss like everyone else.
---
The videos i have linked clearly show i am controlling my accounts manually. And i sure as hell hope they have functioning ways to detect wether people are truly using 3rd party tools or not, beacuse i dont.
---
team 3 is kinda notorious for delivering less refined releases, letting hints at cut content slip through, etc.
---
And still less at a time in a much less coherent package that they cannot fully utilize due to each LS episode being standalone.
---
They're breaking the cardinal rule and robin us of all our fun.
---
So do Ventari and Jalis, Kalla is more of a tease and even Shiro seems to be somewhat happy about not just floating around in the mists.
---
Firebrand Elite Spec for the guardian is awesome. Holy battle mage from hell!
---
That is pretty much false though. You can customize and optimize an engine up to a certain point before it becomes obsolete because it's no longer compatible with new technologies. WoW's graphics are carried by it's non-realistic "cartoony" design. It's not a good looking game by today's standards at all. Also not sure where you're getting those 200% performance improvements but last I checked that third party tool was unstable as hell. 
---
&gt; I wonder if the payerbase will be willing to do some sort of Kickstarter shit to fund Anet to do the rework
---
They already did, its called BUYING THE FUCKING GAME
---
There are different ways to get into WvW.
---
Join an open tag, at best with voice chat. If you get a good commander you can have quite some zerg v zerg / zerg v objective fun.
---
Get yourself a WvW guild, they will teach you every single ounce of this mode.
---
If you already got a guild, ask if someone played on the same world as you and team up.
---
Ask for advise on WvW maps (but be prepared for toxic answers)
---
And for the 1v1 part aka solo roaming: there is an inofficial 1v1 training spot north of the south camp (green/blue borderland) where you can stay safe and practice with players from the other worlds. Anyone interfering gets killed and they won't stomp you after they got you downed (usually) 
---
Too many, and only a few had any consequences unfortunately. From that high up as we sit we can't see all the pain and suffering. I think it's high time Commander got kicked down a notch.

I just think it would be very, very difficult to have her death contribute in a way that is adequate given all that they've done to set things up thus far. For example, if we get Taimi revealing that her death caused such-and-such a thing which now gives them the opportunity to kill him in such-and-such a way, it really wouldn't nearly pay off everything that's been set up to this point. I don't think it would come close.
---
The only thing I can think of that might start to get in the right direction would be if something about the fight or her branding him caused Kralkatorrik to start to become good or something. That might work. For example, what if episode 6 started with the branded who had attacked the Forge and been branded by Aurene emerging from the brand but emerging cleansed, and this causes us to wonder what effect Aurene branding Kralkatorrik to the walls might have done. MAYBE that works.
---
What? There is no connection between those two things whatsoever. 
---
I would love to get season 1 as replayable content as much as anyone (damn I miss that Marionette fight!) but I can understand their standpoint quite well. It's much better use of working hours to release new stuff instead of working with old, long gone content.
---
I'm clearly way too casual cause 2 weeks sounds way too short for my income rate. It definitely doesn't help that I don't do fractals or raids though.
---
Did they actually say anything regarding this?
---
&gt; Problem is
---
Actually, the unfortunate problem is that support staff isn't required to abide by what /u/GaileGray posts. They can ban you and then ignore your further emails even if /u/GaileGray has said your actions are allowed.

&gt; See? Horses!

I see what you did there.

I really loved Aurene and enjoyed her part of our story, and I was just stunned at the end of the episode. I grieved and still do..  Obviously it's very personal whether or not you connected with her, the story can't work for everyone. but I really did grieve, and still do. But I accept that she is gone, at least physically. I just don't want all the emotional pain I went through to be overturned on a dime.
---
True that, the mounts just feels right.
---
They have unique abilities and i am so impressed about the animations.
---
Its just outstanding.
---
Istan is a way to go i heard
---
I saw this coming from the time I read the prequel novels.
---
Also half of Rytlock's brooding was his recklessness in defying orders.
---
This is a society that went from a fairly primitive tribal theocracy to one going through a massive industrial revolution.  Cultures change over time.  Rytlock is far from the first as well.  There was a Charr couple arguing about this in Lion's Arch if I recall from day one.
---
I have a feeling Smodur probably is hoping for more changes too.  Heck it was rumored Smodur wanted to destroy the Claw of the Khan-Ur to symbolize the freedom from the old ways.
---
As a chrono, birds are insanely frustrating. Not for the damage, but the other effects. Specifically, the blind always pops up right when i try to pull some enemies together, so my pull does nothing. Or, I'll try to pull enemies together and instead I'll pull 5 birds. 
---
Obviously i know that you just have to check for blind or spawned birds before pulling. It's still frustrating though. 
---
God forbid they make money off their product? 
---
I get you, like, I'm the opposite and basically loathed Trahearne until his death in HoT. A lot of people cried over it, and all the RP commanders who shipped their characters with trahearne had a field day and are to this day, still in denial that he's dead.
---
I teared up when aurene died. I teared up when I was watching the woodenpotatoes video that goes over her visions and plays her death roar with the crystals piercing her. I got attached to her more than any other of the NPCs because I felt that braham is whiny and made more human than norn, kas and marjory's only personality traits are that they're in love with each other, and Rox is just hanging out along with me for the ride with them. 
---
I’m just pointing out they have similar development histories
---
Meh, sometimes deaths *aren't* meaningful. In fact, they almost always aren't. That's the reality of war, and I think people would benefit by being reminded of that occasionally in fiction instead of constantly being surprised by it (or worse, never learning that lesson) in real life. (Regardless, it's pretty obvious that we wounded Kralk, which may end up being the key to his defeat anyway, even without Aurene.)
---
I don't think it would be bad writing at all for Aurene to die and all the build-up for her being the only solution to go "nowhere", either. It doesn't go "nowhere", it's a moment of complete and total hopelessness that forces the heroes to come up with a solution that they were told did not exist. It's overcoming the odds in the most spectacular way, instead of using the ready-made solution that someone else handed you. That's not bad writing. That's *good* writing, and I wish we'd see more of it.
---
I doubted that you actually did the wrong thing from start to finish in 1:40 when i read that title. I was wrong, have many upvotes.
---
side note I wish more speed clear videos showed the trash pulls and set up before boss kills.
---
It's 3 random instabilities over 3 fractals (up to 5 if you do the CMs)
---
So that's between 9 and 15 picked. Too early to properly maths but I think the chance we get zero overlap between fractals is pretty low.
---
It will depend on the stat set you want - condi DPS players will probably want LS3 maps for viper trinkets, while support players may want LS4 maps for harrier/marshal/diviner trinkets.
---
I saw that Coral Shot in the end, Tolga.
---
Others explained weapons so: at lower levels your traits do seem to make low impact on gameplay, but at higher ones they change a lot. 
---
Basically now you can roll through the content no matter what. Later you will encounter enemies when it's really important if you get either extra condi cleanse or stability or endurance or such. And you will get some synergies between traitlines too!
---
How elite spec change your class? It's different between classes. It gives you traitline that is focused on something new. It gives you new utility skills. On top of that you will also get one new weapon to use. Best part about elite spec is that it will change your class mechanic a bit.
---
In your case, core guardian have passive auras that can be activated for better effect when needed (and you probably don't even use it before lvl80 enemies). As dragonhunter you keep passives but enhance active ability of them. They become physical effects/attacks. As firebrand activating your auras gives you temporarily access to 5 new skills related to virtue you used. For example burning one gives you fire spells and is most offensive focused. 
---
Being in elite spec don't make you better. It make you focused on particular aspect like melee fight or support. It also make your build loose some versatility. It's easier to explain on elementalist.
---
Ele can use 4 elements always. Core ele have traits for: free, water, earth, air and one to enhance element swapping and arcane spells. Your core ele can specialise in 3 elements or 2 and enhance swapping. Taking elite replaces one of your traitline so you loose versatility. You can not specialise in three elements anymore but 2 at best. Or one. In exchange you can become dual attuned weaver or powerful aoe caster/support tempest.
---
Not a whole lot to do in terms of high-level content lately, huh?
---
Either way, good stuff. This was fun to watch.
---
my engineer is named after this class.
---
make it peering through your a-hole.
---
God forbid people want to actually earn things in the game. It's just like glider skins. Why do you need to release 100% of them on the store. Fuck anyone who wants to earn something instead of just farm gold all day. 
---
Its a new secret infusion
---
Okay you caught my attention, I need accessories and trinkets I have a power and a condi main. So what map would get me earrings?
---
Make your own sets..? Which ones are you complaining about.. 
---
TIL holy shit this is awesome. never knew they made it in game in some way.
---
I need to mount up, even when it's only 5m 😆
---
Bitterfrost frontier + Bloodstone fen (LS3 ep3+1) 
---
I wish I could feel like there is too much going on in WvW.  
---
It's not that simple a point, though, and this is incredibly biased, circular logic.
---
If you weren't turned off from the mode by the above-mentioned issues, that just means that you're "fit" for the mode as-is. And that's fine... except that says *nothing* about whether the mode is actually *good* as-is. There's always *someone* who likes literally *everything*, but does that mean that literally everything is fine the way it is? Of course not.
---
You don't think that there are players who have the potential to be really good, active WvWers... if only they hadn't been turned off of the game mode in the first month of playing it? Or who might still be playing it and doing great, if only one or two small things had been tweaked? They might like everything about WvW, except for one thing that diminished their enjoyment to the point that they wandered off to get involved in something else. That does not inherently mean they're "bad" or "unsuited" for WvW. It just means their priorities may be different than yours, or their tolerance level for certain things is slightly lower.
---
It's ridiculous to claim that just because *you* weren't turned off of WvW doesn't mean that other people won't be -- and it's delusional to believe that only those who are willing to settle for the mode as-is are the only ones who could possibly ever want to play it.
---
You brought up a good point about no traditions being thrown out yet.  I'm not sure why so many people are reading this as Rytlock giving up Sohothin.  It's more he's pushing past feeling it defines him.  He says the sword will still be there when he gets back.
---
There are two additional Mount Action keys that aren't on the mount toolbar. You can map these in keyboard settings. I used the 2 and 3 keys since they aren't used while mounted. Action 2 dives without the attack action, Action 3 pulls up. With some practice, you find that once you build enough momentum (by diving from high enough/allowing the momentum to build), you have the force needed to swoop back up at the bottom of the dive. There are lots of open spaces all over the world to practice, especially in maps with high places to start from.
---
At the end part of that, I think it would depend on how it's done.  I admit I'm very behind in the story but even fairly early on Rytlock called my character a good friend in a heartfelt letter in game.  Some things are extremely private to Charr, but possibly the player and especially Logan are closer in Charr terms than even lovers would be.  I thought Logan walking up on Rytlock while he was crying and then patiently waiting for him to continue was a nice touch to show how close they are, because from what I gather crying is probably the single most private thing for a charr.
---
You'll likely find leveling as a group of 5 to be horrible. Yes, events will scale to your party size and that aspect of the game will be fantastic, but Renown Hearts (the 'quests' of GW2 PvE) are going to be a nightmare. Since Renown Heart progess bars aren't shared across the party, everyone in your group will have to tag the mob before it dies in order to receive credit. Random enemies around heart locations will not scale in relation to your party, which means they will die very quickly. This is why Renown Hearts are a pain even in parties of 2.
---
When you guys decide to level, I would recommend forgoing most of the heart and instead explore the world and search for dynamic events to do. They give slightly more experience than the hearts do, and they'll feel MUCH MUCH MUUUCH better in a group. There are even many events that are designed to be done in groups such as champion spawns, which will definitely be a lot of fun with do tackle with your friends.
---
I'm exactly the opposite. No story = no reason for me to care about the world enough to play.
---
quick question.  what should i do with all the piles bloodstone dust that are taking space in my inventory bag.  I usually destroy them but i feel like i may regret it later if i don't keep them.
---
thank you
---
You've gotten a ton of answers for most of the other stuff so I'll just explain the first one a bit more.
---
In the open worlds there aren't really quests, but hearts which function similarly. If everyone is in the party together as you do something the progresses the heart (work on an event, kill enemies, deliver items, etc) everyone will get progress.
---
Every 10 levels you'll have a Personal Story quest which has a bunch of instanced missions. Everyone in the party can go through those however only the people with that specific story step active will get rewards for it (e.g. If you have 3 people go with Human Street Rat they'll all have the same story active when they get to 10, but people with other races or other backgrounds will have a different quest and won't get rewards). Additionally whoever is the one that starts the instances will be the one that decides choices for it and that'll affect everyone. The first 3 Personal Story quests are dependent on race and character select choices. The next 3 are dependent on which choice you make for an Order while the last few are the same for everyone.
---
Also one other thing that'll be important to know is that GW2 uses a 'megaserver' that makes a bunch of instances of the maps. What world you all use doesn't matter except for WvW. It is possible for you guys to be split across instances. If you're all on the same map but can't find each other and the portrait is black you can right click on them and there will be a 'Join in X' (X being the current map) and you'll switch over to their instance.
---
Does the heal amount of the warrior trait, might makes right, scale with the number of stacks applied?
---
No worries. Was wondering if I was perhaps overlooking something, myself xD
---
I said fuck it and spent 10$ on gold lol. Absolutely worth it to me, it's a huge quality of life boost
---
I was in a zerg once but I am not really a fan of that. I guess WvW isn't for me then?
---
Feel free to delete it. You get a little bit of dust from every Champ bag you open on a level 80 character so it's easy to farm a bunch of it up if needed.
---
Otherwise you can craft it into Bloodstone Bricks if you have a weapon or armor crafting still up to 450. There's also a few 'eaters' that will let you turn some of it into random trash loot.
---
WvW is for fans of massive, large scale engagements. If smaller, more controlled fights are your thing, maybe sPvP will be more fun for you? 
---
I dont know if it is possible to look back further but my games i have played these past 5 days have been custom arenas ranked ones and 1 unranked match http://prntscr.com/mj9ezz
---
I have won all of my ranked matches listed in this picture, i did not multibox in them.
---
Yes i have multiboxed in the custom arenas listed, to get my dailies done.
---
The violation speficially say the violation is multiboxing in player vs player. 
---
By your logic, say i multiboxed in an unranked match 2 weeks ago, wouldnt it make sense for the GM who would have to monitor me to simply just suspend be there and then, multiboxing in a unranked match is a violation. Why would i be investigated for 1 more week just to be suspended when i do a custom arena match which is allowed in the multiboxing policy.
---
You are pulling at straws here, but the picture you paint makes no sense.
---
You are very talented. Is there an album with more of your work?
---
Oh, I think you might need the second mastery on griffon for the swoop, but I find that ability useless anyway, as it doesn't do much damage or anything.
---
The most important ones are Dive and Rise, and with the last mastery, the Dive bomb, which is just a Flap during a Dive that gives you a huge movement speed bonus.
---
I don't think most people realize how irrelevant it is how old most game engines are.  The only reason to start from scratch is if it costs less money/time to do so than to modify what already exists.  The outright meme of people bashing Bethesda over using the "same" engine as if it's some physical object hurts my head especially.
---
So I should delimit my own freedom and stop commenting, only because some random people in the internet say that I'm "answering wrong"?...
---
&gt;No apologizes needed, its because of this same tool that I could do the raids and very good dps rotations with barely any kind of latency.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Its true that I couldn't get any printscreen from that but we can always do the same raids again and now take a printscreen ;)
---
5g for the sigil? Damn thats cheap. Most ppl who have the armor now paid between 10-15g per sigil. And 150g+mats currently for what is considered to be one of the nicest armor sets is easily a fair price imo
---
I applaud the effort for getting data at the higher MF, but it's (IMO) completely infeasible for anything but opening small amounts of envelopes.  So it def works for people who only open their own envelopes if they want to go after it.
---
If you mass open them (like 4 stacks or more), then it will eat through your boosters due to downtime between each batch of envelopes.
---
The info is appreciated!
---
Listen here Mr SendMeCuteFeet. I'll ignore your weirdass nick. Guild Wars 2 an MMO game! It's not MOBA nor FPS... People spend YEAERS and YEARS in making and building their characters. There are nothing like GW2 out there which turns their EARN currency to PURCHASE currency. You can farm gold and buy whatever the glider you just like by turning your earned golds into purchasable gems. You can EITHER FARM like a GOD to get Twilight or buy it from a PLAYER who has farmed it like a God for 135$. I just don't want to waste any more of my time for you. I hope you get well soon and stop being so toxic! I know what people like you are. They just want everything easly. Trust me you'd regret for having everything done in GW2. It would be quite boring. You are just boring.
---
Hmmm I'll wait until I pass judgement. I initially hated the Pharus longbow, but after seeing it in-game, I changed my mind on it. Of course whenever something gets changed in WvW I tend to be suspicious as to how it will improve my favourite game mode, but sometimes it does end up being better (Making Borderlands produce pips instead of Edge Of The Mists for example, made people go back to playing on the borderlands - as it should have been in the first place). I hope it's for the better, but I'll wait until whatever it is, is announced.
---
I go them too. There is one recent commit to an effect that requires a newer version of reShade and the current gw2Hook is too old to support it. I got my gw2Hook to work once I reverted it. I can put up a guide once I'm home if you want.
---
I did not know that, thanks
---
Thank you! We came prepared with buffs for 2h (we had no idea how long this would take). Luckily it did not take more than that.
---
(one)
---
GW1 on the Switch, heck yes. 
---
I wouldn't mind a yak mount for WvW to be honest. If it speeds things up - like travel (some maps can take as long as 1-2 minutes just to get to the other side! That is simply INSANE in my opinion). As long as it takes a while to get back onto the yak, like a 20 or 30 second delay AFTER being in combat rule for example, or else it'll be a bit overpowering.
---
Except you never stated what you actually /do/ to earn that much.
---
&gt; I think you'll be disappointed when Aurene comes back next episode (but that's just the theory I subscibe to :P)
---
Given developer comments, I don't think she'll be pulling a Joko regardless, as their comments seem to hint that episode 6 will be about dealing with the aftermath of Aurene's death, and pulling a Joko would be "she's go-oh hey she's moving again" because Joko's "death" lasts seconds, and the same went for Khilbron and The Hunter, even Fendi Nin who was at the very least lich-like.
---
Given the (increasingly poor in hindsight) structure of the current LW, we're going to be in a new map, while THP will remain restricted to Episode 5 access, so unless they make a duplicate zone, we're not going back to where Aurene died ever.
---
There was also a dev comment that hinted, albeit very very abstractly, that we might be killing Kralkatorrik in the Mists to solve the problem (which would be yet another case of massively setting the narrative to be leading in a completely different direction - and I don't mean the Aurene buildup). Which suggests no resurrection, possibly no Aurene at all.
---
We need to get a global fix to axes and sickles before I care about 1 bugged pick.
---
Ad Infinitum doesn't need 99cm/100cm, you're dumber than I thought. 
---
No. You don't get immersed. You clearly have no idea what immersion means. 
---
I snarked about them for a while until I eventually picked up PoF and man...mounts in every other MMO feel like pointless move speed buffs now.
---
The Anet team that worked/works on them does amazing work.
---
I see you are the average ignorant redditor
---
What a victim complex lol
---
All your revenant lore needs (90% of what can be answered): [https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/hidden-arcana-role-playing-the-revenant/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/hidden-arcana-role-playing-the-revenant/)
---
To question 1:
---
&gt;\[...\] the relationship between revenant and legend varies between individuals, as some legends are considerably more thrilled about being channeled than others. In fact, some of them are downright cranky about it; Mallyx in particular is so offended at having his immense power borrowed by upstart mortals that using some of those powers will take health from the revenant. King Jalis Ironhammer, on the other hand, is overjoyed to be back in action and will bolster the revenant’s defenses while gleefully encouraging them to take him into battle. 
---
Legends do not need convincing, and they cannot refuse, and the revenant is the one using the power. They may not like it, but they must comply. Mallyx is prime example of this. In fact, the original plan was to have legends that "don't like being used" cause damage to the player in exchange for higher abilities, though this was scrapped in the end.
---
To question 2:
---
This doesn't have an exact answer, so besides weapon skills and what others can do, it's pretty hard to say. Ultimately, revenants are "combat scholars" in their theme. But despite mechanical limitations, they likely can use things like racial skills. If they were to use non-legend abilities, they'd likely mirror the weapon skills which channel the Mists in a more direct method than legends.
---
There's also the fact that, in lore, multiclassing is fully possible though time consuming - compared most often to getting two different bachelor degrees, and revenant teachings would be furthest from the rest of the other professions (probably closest to warrior due to the "combat nature" of things and how almost all of core warrior abilities are not strictly magical).
---
What if we end up talking to the pale tree again after all this time. Maybe she can give us another future sight of what we need to do?
---
You can skip past them without stealthing as well, and there is ironically more skill involved to skip them than there is to kill them slowly like you were describing. But fortunately as you said, there are plenty of other options to pick from content-wise
---
Do three dailies every day, that is 2 gold a day so it will only take 125 days to get enough gold. And that is without other sources - selling items giving to you at login, for example.
---
what? you dont like random enemy spawning at your position when you just wana go ooc? perma blindness? 4 random birds to fuck your every pull? thx god they dont push or something.
---
I saw more or less a 20% increase in minimum FPS in several areas.
---
Every Asura I play is bald.
---
r/ATBGE
---
Checklist achievements and doing the same meta, fractal, and raid you've all ready done a million times since 2013 only goes so far.
---
so does it help smooth it out? , I'm more jealous of the sub 100 ping
---
It's the same in GW2, except there's even less to experience the first time around.
---
Headstart vet here. I think the issue for me is kind of a weird one - there are so, SO many things I want to do in the game to the point that it's almost paralyzing. So many achievements, so many skins, so many professions, so much I still haven't done. 
---
But! At the same time, I want Gen 2 legendaries, which means that I am pigeonholed into very specific things to do with my time if I want to get these weapons. I have to get the same things over and over: gotta get the HoT map gifts, gotta get crystalline ore ad nauseum, gotta do WvW over and over for battle gifts, gotta buy amalgamated gemstones and mystic coins. Unless I abandon my goals for the legendaries I want, I can't branch out to the other types of play that interest me.
---
I do the current LW episodes and festivals so I don't miss out, but then I'm right back on leg duty. It's a weird place to be. There's not room for everything if you actually want these weapons. Maybe this is a really specific issue, I dunno. But that's where I'm at, and I'd imagine I'm not the only one. 
---
That does look pretty smooth
---
Nice demo, thanks! Can I add it as showcase on github page?
---
If you not trolling me over, cause i not see any signature bugs :D
---
I've been getting it too, but on my own character if I'm wearing an outfit. 
---
Yeah WoW is literally just a gear treadmill.  GW2 has issues with making everything suuuuuper grindy though.  The sheer amount of resource value that it takes to get a full ascended set is mind-boggling when you compare the sunk effort to the 5% stat gain lol.  Crafting an ascennded piece doesn't even feel rewarding because, woe, I am now a whopping 1% more effective than I was before.
---
You should make it on Feb 12, so you can open the last 16 also :D
---
That feeling when 40 FPS is relatively smooth.
---
I wish more people would post videos of their guild halls =\ it’s such a shame that people put so much work into decorating them just for them to never be seen &lt;\3
---
Yeah but at least once you have it, you have it. In MMO's like WoW you need to put a lot of effort into appeasing the RNG gods to get best stats and then a few months later it's trash. I'll take GW2's one time grind over the gear treadmill any day. Besides, most of the game can be done in exotics which take barely any effort at all to get. 
---
How dead are the PoF maps? If I were to buy the expansion now, will I be able to complete all the content/achievements in the PoF maps or did I miss the train?
---
Are you asking me?  I don't care if you believe me or not, belief has no bearing whatsoever on the truth.  Truth is according to Anet insiders that Anets GM's are not so saintly as we all would like to think.  They DO have issues with certain players ie; post-it notes with problem players names in their cubicles.  This makes them less than fair when it comes to suspending or banning a person.  
---
In the first place, you cannot equip ANY bundle items in raids.
---
Never seen an ad that excludes necro for DPS. Necro is more than sufficient, if the player is good.
---
its about farming the currencies. rubies take too long.
---
Honestly the reason WoW's and FFXIV's content is more replayable is that those games have gear progression and GW2 doesn't. If you had to replay every latest fractal x amount of times to get the new best weapon every time a new one would come out, the game's "lack of content" problem would dissolve into thin air.
---
you will be, no worries. 
---
Ehh, yes
---
Pretty smooth for any mmo*
---
There's a lack of content in GW2 because there's.. a lack of content. FFXIV and WoW regularly release replayable content. You aren't just repeating the same fractals you've been doing since 2013, because you get a fresh set of 8-10 dungeons every 2 years. That's why the treadmill works.
---
i normally get this kind of performance, but with both character model settings set to "low".
---
you can add it if you like.
---
what do you mean by signature bugs?
---
Man what the fuck even lol
---
Thanks for the help!
---
what's PBO?
---
overall, FPS didn't increase. it DOES allow me to run higher character model settings, but i suspect that it'd only make a difference with small to medium sized zergs.
---
once 65 vs 65 rolls in, i doubt d912pxy would make any difference; fps would suck no matter what.
---
Do you wanna ping 10k LI for a PUG wing? This is what you get
---
According to the devs, Asura live ~5% longer than humans
---
Taimi is 13 in season 1, and is about a year older per living world season. So it would make sense that Taimi experienced her growth period, assuming that asura follow the same pattern as humans 
---
Precision boost overdrive, kind of a built in overclock that the ryzen x chip cpus have. Basically means my ryzen is always running GW2 at 4.3GHz.
---
I barely ever use max character limit and never in WvW because of the massive stuttering, and this is at 1080p not 4K so your settings and framerate are really impressive, makes me want to give d912pxy a try.
---
Definitely second the "usefulness of each". I love that even after unlocking the griffon I still hop between Springer for high jumps, Raptor for flat travel, Skimmer for water, and Beetle for quick map exploration. It really makes me happy that starting mounts aren't just dead content. And hey, at least the one mount I don't use is super cute! Sorry sand pup :P
---
There's a difference between being vague and potentially misleading in interviews when you don't want to spoil something, and spending literally 3 years directing the plot and lore into one direction ("there must be four Elder Dragons alive/replacements or The All becomes imbalanced and destroys the world") just to go into a direction that is the complete opposite.

But then again, they already did this with the sylvari reveal and, to a lesser extent, Lazarus/Balthazar, where everything they put into the game logically pointed to one conclusion, just for things to go against that logical conclusion (sylvari are dragon minions despite the fact that everything about the sylvari is opposite of how dragon minions function; Lazarus was actually Balthazar despite the total lack of proper clues and the only clue that really existed (Caudecus having an aspect) being both potentially misleading (Bauer who gave the aspect is a lying liar who lied to Caudecus before) and directly retconning previously established lore (in GW1, Lazarus revived without all his aspects)).

Ah no that's not the reason at all. The thing is I don't like leveling in MMOs. I can barely bear it when I play it the first time like GW2 but more than once is out of the question for the most times. If you want a good picture how much I hate leveling, I have all classes at least on lvl 110 in WoW and I only leveled one from 1 to max. So after completing almost five areas I don't feel like doing it again on a new char simply to see if I like it more. It's probably not much for most people here but I'm confident that I will lose interest in playing if I do it again.

Right? I use the raptor and griffin mostly, but the others are very useful, especially in old content like heart of thorns with all the verticality!
---
&gt;we are even explicitly told that the gods come from somewhere beyond the Mists
---
You can't really come from beyond the Mists, since the Mists is literally the entire multiverse. Everything resides within the Mists, though some (afterlife realms, borderlands, fractals, etc.) more directly than others (worlds). Unless you're just using that phrase to mean "they're from another world".

skimmer would just need a mastery that lingers the water mov. speed for like 5s after u leave water

Is there a good way to view all types of weapons and armor in the game by type and style? Perusing the wiki page is tedious, and some collections don’t have direct galleries
---
There was still some way to do it, I clearly remember getting up to level 64, and I know there was people in the 80s too.
---
Now those times were crazy.
---
Is this for weapons too?

My WvW experience:

Some dude: "Hey everyone! Join our Teamspeak and join our party!"  
---
Me \*Joins both teamspeak and party\*  
---
Another dude: "Ew a tempest! gtfo of our party."  
---
:(
---
&gt; If everyone is in the party together as you do something the progresses the heart (work on an event, kill enemies, deliver items, etc) everyone will get progress.  
---
that is simply not true. you will not get any progress for events / hearts if others do stuff and you are afk.  
---
everyone has to progress the heart themselfes or do contribution at some event to get rewards.

Let's hope Smodur blows some shit up and causes such a ruckus that the commander get's some sort of an epiphany.
---
This isn't a benchmark, merely a demonstration of playability. Specifically, it's to demonstrate that character model settings on highest becomes playable with this mod.
---
I plan on running some actual benchmarks later this evening.
