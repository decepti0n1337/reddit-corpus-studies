Take a look at [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character)  as well, the real important thing is getting your stats close to what you need. 
---
---
---
Why, what happens?  If you don't mind me asking?
---
Go to /r/guildrecruitment to find a guild looking for more players, plenty of guilds from all gamemodes and levels of play ask for people on that subreddit.
---
I ordered a plush Quaggan as a Christmas gift. I received a CS:GO mug instead. Left many messages on their perpetually busy customer service line, but they never called me back.
---

---
If you send them money, good luck.
---
Yes, it depends on what your salvaging.
---
Just in case you didn't know, there is also r/GuildRecruitment and r/GamerPals for finding friends to play with.
---
Discords like the one linked in the sidebar here, or those of popular GW2 content creators are also great places to make friends.
---
A few weeks ago someone posted their idea about a Dominion of the Winds home city and a single neighboring noob map for a hypothetical Tengu playable race.   I like that idea better because it could effectively fold this race into the core maps/story, allowing Tengu characters to become the Pact Commander.  When we go to Cantha, I would prefer *ALL* the maps to be level 80.  
---
I know of the one in Tangled Depths, near the Ogre Waypoints. There's another one?
---
If it's internally consistent, that's awesome and death isnt problematic. The problem is more that our character and characters around us act as though death is a major thing. Eir dying was major enough to power like two separate plot lines, Aurenes death is supposed to be terrifying for the world, Glints death and Vlasts death, our player characters death, etc etc. Death is dangled over us in the plot of GW2 as a terrifying end but then routinely ignored, which is confusing because you are absolutely right that it wasn't really that way in GW1.
---
whats with the gaudy intro lmfao
---
&gt;\-snip OP-
---
Media: "Avengers: Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover of all time."
---
u/Aetharion: "Hold my character sheet."
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What's the reason to think it's not?
---
Silly.
---
If they shutdown arc and put Meme Templates behind a fucking paywall, you KNOW there will be a huge shitstorm.
---
Thanks, that would work, sure, but it's not the question in asking.
---
That... doesn't really change the fact that the first one *I* saw was the one provided by the OP, which does have the screen glitches, and thus the one I based my original commentary off of.
---
Usually, you don't go searching for multiple sources of the same video, when you just found one.
---
If you think horizontal progression sucks then go back to WoW and FFXIV.  You have plenty of treadmill over on that side of the lake.
---
Well... That's cuz there's no key bind emote in place..
---
Also guildwars emote feels a lil limited
---
They usually go around the popular maps trying to get people (Which is how I found out about it) and always have 3 LFG taxis.
---
I show up 5 to 10 minutes early and have never had a problem getting in. I don't know any names offhand.
---
I prefer the W S W W W S S W S W
---
Thank you for making this. I actually stumbled across it a few weeks ago while working on a side project and loved it. Super easy to use locally (with stuff like Photoshop) and on the web. Definitely worth a look!
---
Except they've explicitly asked people to stop posting these Warclaw exploits on reddit, and use bug reports.
---
Anet doesn't have finance issues, they have leadership and organization issues. 
---
Funny, I have started to weave in some elements of GW2 into my homebrew campaign as well. The players are currently level 4 and the area they are in has been plagued by Undead in recent months. Abominations and creatures made from living flesh, souls and fey are coming to life around them. The work of a Wizard and Druid. 
---
By corrupting an ancient tree that gives life to creatures of the fey they are instead able to have it not only give life to the dead but corrupt the living and fey that are alive. As they venture through this part of the story they will have the opportunity to "cleanse" this tree. This tree will become sentient and be able to cleanse the undead and corrupted fey. Creating a race of tree-like feypeople that remain connected to this tree. With this a new playable race will become available in my campaign(inspired by sylvari.) I'm even going through the trouble of creating the race from scratch(none of the homebrew docs I've found were interesting enough to use.)
---
A happy coincidence is that before I learned anything about the gods in Guild Wars I made a similar pantheon of Ascended beings each controlling a domain/school of magic. Now that I've learned a bit about the GW gods since they introduced Balthazar back when, I will use some of that lore to expand my own campaign world. 
---
I will definitely use a glint-like character at some point. Lucky none of them play Gw2.
---
Hi, I recently download the TaCO maps for SAB and I am not seeing the yellow lines like in the screenshot but instead it's green stars that dot the map, as seen [here](https://imgur.com/uvfEE6M). Also it appears to be slowing down my PC.  Any suggestions on how to fix this? 
---
Usually this info appears if you add "-MapLoadinfo" (or something similar) in the game's shortcut target in its properties.
---
then make sure you dont mistake someone whose never asked the question they're asking for a repost. do you really think its a better idea to redirect someone to a thread thats been erased from visibility to ask a question where no one is participating anymore, than to just ask their question and get their responses? If that somehow makes your experience on the subreddit noticeably worse, you spend too much time on it
---
im not trying to win anything here lmfao, i'm just saying, it's very common to see encoding glitches in twitch streams.  but youre right in that this is ultimately a pointless discussion
---
But why I’m the other guild too then? You never gave an explanation for that
---
But why in two different guilds then?
---
They are also in the squad with us doing missions with us. it's a common mistake people make
---
First shot looks like a chase and catch type of play sequence to me. Note the speed lines for a sense of urgency and the rocks coming towards the camera (obstacles to dodge during the chase). 
---
What? 
---
By far ranger.
---
Core power ranger, very simple to play, got a meatshield when fighting bosses, good at surviving hard encounters solo. Downside, you could play the game with a your brain shutdown.
---
Druid making plays feels great. Right when the boss is about to do a hard-hitting, execute skill, you can pull the friend put of harms way and save them. Not to mention teleporting spirits and 25 might for team.
---
Downside, it can get boring if you are stuck playing this role all the time, especially when you're not into support roles.
---
Soulbeast is prolly my fave as it has balance of survivability and dmg. Gives a wide range of pet infused skills that are quite useful like double take down meld pet skill then unmeld for the pet to automatically do another take down. You can also meld with a bird to escape (swiftness and soar)
---
It was my pleasure &lt;3 Thanks for coming out :D
---
A small compilation of SAB fails that one of my lovely stream viewers put together for me. It didn't seem right letting this editing masterpiece go to waste, so I wanted to share it with you guys! 
---
Do yourself a favour and rebind that shit
---
&gt;RAM
---
guess i shoulda upgraded for 16gb ram instead of 12gb...lol...
---
And this will end up with a dragon mech vs dragon kaiju.
---
Excelsior.
---
Of course it isn't. But they have also said that the actual Tyria is way bigger than the playable maps.
---
For everything there is, there's also memories of it in the mists.  
---
There's definitely a Tyria that's real. A canon story. Possibly even different alternate realities with different Tyrias.
---
But it's impossible for each player story to be a canon one. 
---
Thousands of characters, with thousands of multiple different stories, and thousands of different combinations of the orders. The commander can't possible defeat Balthazar more than one, but any player can do it over and over. 
---
When we play and replay the game, what we are doing is closer to playing in the fractal of the actual Tyria that isn't a fractal.
---
I bought the SAB combo of the shirt and mouse pad 2 years ago and can assure you that those hold up nicely. I usually wear the shirt every weekend and it's still solid today. The mouse pad however is bending at the bottom right edge upward due to wear and tear over the two years.
---
They also throw in a free gift and as you can see by the pictures below... They must think I'm a My Little Pony fan.

When ?!
---
Five years later and I still haven't made an Asura that has stuck. My next character once I earn enough gems will be one but I've just never been able to stick with em.
---
Well then it would make the bunny useless.
---
Thank you, that was great fun.
---
/r/dataisbeautiful

As an ex wow player I completely agree. Ebg never ends so objectives don't matter in comparison to a 15-45 min bg. 
---
It would be nice to have an ab or av for gw2. 
---
I love wvw don't get me wrong. Wsg would be nice too shit. 
---
Tbh though wvw isn't all that serious, I think wows bgs and city chat were far more toxic too.

No problem, and I hope the memes didn't scare you away xD Some of the jokes were definitely, ahem, monkaTOS.
---
No he hasn't. If Anet implemented this and broke all of your overlays you would all be crying. The game runs fine on dx9, they don't need to pour money and resources into something that already works
---
I wish Ascended Shards of Glory worked like this as well, but you actually earn fewer shards-per-pip once you hit Byzantium.
---
IMO they put this backitem (and glider) a bit too high on character model, presumably to avoid exessive clipping issues. I still like it, but.. yeah, could be better.
---
Only 2 more years!
---
Ohhh ouch.  I had a similar issue where this guy I turned down kept harassing me, and (back when we used TS) he would start harassing me on TS after I blocked him in game.  Then he would get on alt accounts and continue on with his verbal assaults, and even get his buddies to msg me and try to get me to unblock him on his main.  The best support said to me was "block him and keep reporting."  He said a lot of really crude things to me and I still saw him in game despite reporting what he had been saying.  I ultimately ended up buying an alt account and playing on EU instead of NA to get away from him.    
---
TS admins were really great an banned him on the spot after I reported it and sent some screens; GW2 support on this issue was non-existent feeling.   I thought he would at least get banned for a month or so on his main and alt accounts....   
---
I have had very positive gw2 support for issues with gem store and like in game crafting stuff - but for harassment they seem to want to be very hands off.   
---
Strange, seems like I'm getting less FPS than previous builds, even lesser than without the addon... :|  
---
I'm on a 8700k@5GHZ  
---
I was going for something more along the lines of the pale tree. But I suppose that works along with it. I'm surprised I haven't taken anything directly from GoT yet. So far I've been inspired by stuff from:
---
Golden Sun
---
Warcraft
---
Starcraft
---
GW2
---
LotR
---
The Witcher Series
---
Divinity: OS 1 &amp; 2
---
Lovely fella, for an Inquest! What kind of music does he play?
---
I think it really needs warclaw and gliding enabled there as well.  The map is huge and it takes quite a long time to get from one point to another. 
---
They did the same thing for me! I was so relieved 
---
He sounds confused not freaked out tbh, so i really dislike you start your text with "lool calm down no need to freak out", if i were him that'd make me insta ignore everything else you typed right there.
---
Just saying.
---
*WHAT IN UNENDING OCEAN??*
---
Techno :P
---
Also thank you :)
---
You friend, are my hero! You have simply solved my problem of not being able to run guild wars properly.
---
basically the exact inspirations i use, except i through in a bit of gladiator/spartacus in there and make them fight each other to 1hp :D 
---
I got back on after forever not playing cause I remembered I loved SAB and was doing trib, I quickly remembered why I I never finished trib in the first place. 
---
Can anyone explain to me what this is?
---
go to your material storage and sell stuff, you probably don't realize you have at least a few hundred gold in there
---
Why did it disappear? Is it one of my friends?
---
What's the best healing skill choice for druid in fractals? I find myself using healing spring a lot (especially with certain instabilities) instead of water spirit since the spirit changes and I feel like it's better, but I'm not sure if it's in my head.
---
Anet is just retarded as usual. Send the shitty CS a ticket. 
---
Ryuk from Death Note
---
You need to talk to support.   
---
This just sounds like you got cought in an anti-gold seller algorithm.  I'm sure support will fix it for you.  They are pretty reasonable and relatively fast (2-3 day turnaround).
---
Bruh you're supposed to dodge roll, not self-knockdown
---
Here I thought you were talking about the white info box....
---
Alright thanks.  
---
I just wanted to make sure I didn't break any rules before I submitted a ticket
---
Whenever I fail dodge jump be like :
---
I like Arkk's story but maybe CMs should have an expanded story too.
---
Fractals are such an interesting concept.
---
I will say this and continue to say it; play PvP, use your favorite build (muscle memory &gt; meta most of the time) and win or lose try to have fun (by not expecting to win) and you will be swimming in gold, mats and stuff to make legendary armor in no time. /muteall if you must, but it is fun and profitable.
---
I love no kit holo. 
---
No need to mute all. 
---
Just temporarily switch to combat chat or something.
---
That's the beauty of ranked. It's purely additional rewards.
---
god, I wish one day I will become clever enough to create a name to surpass the genius that is *Zhaitron*
---
I think he may have some acne.
---
1) I wouldn't count on them being free. They're not really current content anymore so Anet probably won't go back and promote them very much
---
2) It's possible, they've dealt with gem issues like that before, but I don't think it's a guarantee that they would refund you. They've refunded me when I bought something the day before it went on sale, but I don't know if they would if you miss the sale; I don't know how much they'd take into account the circumstances.
---
The group only got to this *because* they surrendered to Acererak - an enemy they couldn't defeat - who then brought them to Tyria.
---
Then Acererak allied with Joko, while some pulls from a modified *Deck of Many Things* pretty much completely removed Acererak from the equation. Then Joko took over. Turns out he's much more ambitious than Acererak.
---
This entire fight scene is supposed to wrap up several story arcs started either on Tyria or elsewhere, and was partly Abaddon's idea of a gambit that could throw all of the relevant threats into a single arena.
---
If the gambit doesn't work, either Balthazar, Dhuum, Joko or Kralkatorrik will probably end up destroying the rest, and becoming a whole lot more powerful. Possibly they might become a threat to the entire multiverse at that point, or maybe they will "only" be able to conquer all of Tyria.
---
If the group succeeds, one of them plans on draining Dhuum's power in order to become a new God of Death. Then the rest head back to another world in order to save that one from a Lovecraftian "Mother of All Monsters", which has been set up as the *actual* Big Bad of the campaign.
---
Damn ok thx
---
You mean the error box when loading the effects?
---
Asura: It's skin is too slick, our attacks aren't having any effect. I wonder how it feels about kegs of gun powder.
---
thats a shoiper if i ever seen one for a single second
---
Some WOW players: "Gw2 sucks, it's too easy and there's no challenge in the combat and progression, WOW is much more challenging and fun!"
---
Other WOW players: "Gw2 sucks, I keep dying, the gear I paid/grinded for doesn't make me better than other players and prevent me from feeling like a God, it's too competitive and boring(aka game is too hard) ! Wow is much better and more fun!
---
I know it's not word to word what was said here but I love how every olayer who says WOW is better than Gw2 is usually divided in one of the 2 groups with completely contradicting information. It's confusing hehe. 
---
So. Many. Times.  &gt;.&lt;
---
This seems to happen to me everytime I ask someone to be my friend.
---
Praise Joko
---
"These are my people,  these are my friends~"

---
What a lot of salt from from a salty lad :) 
---
Guess you‘ll lose the lawsuit.
---
Haha. Someone needs to read the TOS. You don’t own anything, you bought a license to play, that was revoked, because you displayed threatening behaviour. You’ve no leg to stand on. 
---
That /s is so bloody small I would have sworn yu would have meant /serious
---
Because of how much WvW I've played I have enough tomes to level like 10 characters to 80.  And I earned all those over the course of simply playing the game at max level on my main.
---
I have the choya plushie.  
---
It is good.
---
I seriously doubt that's the only "offending" thing yu have said. 
---
Casual*
---
Heh this is also why shadowbanning exist
---
Isn'tAureneDead?
---
Unless something's changed during the years, I remember them saying fractals were always snippets of the past, so the "future" of another timeline seems impossible, unless something's changed.
---
Anet doesn't run this reddit channel smarty pants. 
---
if everything was legit then you buying something with a bad Credit Card can lead to both accounts being banned. 
---
Cannot parse message; please restate. 
---
Honestly if you really spent that much money on this game and if this is all you did in that context then yeah I wouldn't blame you for seeking any avenue of restitution you could find. 
---
I doubt it but I can see why you'd be mad if this is all that happened. Still that's quite a statement to make even in a PvP context. 
---
NSP is steamrolling you guys this week.
---
You are a worn old tripe.  The angry idiot that will "sue".  You will disappear and we won't here anymore bathering about suing. 
---
&gt; But if the issue gets resolved after the LW's are no longer on sale, what are the chances of Anet refunding me the difference if I get them after the sale ends?
---
I never heard of a refund when you missed a sale, for whatever reason. I myself had the same problem with my credit card not going through, and support could not care less. Your case is a bit different since it is LW episodes, which the players get for free in a certain time window, anyway. So there is more hope, I think. 
---
For information: There are other legit sources for so called gem cards, which is really just a code, that can be delivered by email, sometimes within minutes. The downside is, I never found a source selling less than 2.000 gems. 
---
cool story bro
---
r/gw2exchange I believe part of why your post isn't getting through is due to the fact of rule #1 on the sub, 5-week old reddit account, which yours isn't unfortunately
---
I don't have pictures handy, but I play a long eared asura (male Guardian) and I have pretty much given up on finding a good helmet. The ones that let the ears pop out all look weird and the clipping is really noticeable. The cultural helms are pretty much the only ones that look natural, but I'm not a fan of them. The rest of the good looking helmets chop off the ears. I am so used to seeing my characters big ears that when they aren't there it's actually kind of unsettling.
---
I can only really speak for heavy armors though.
---
Thankfully my life has moved back towards the physical sciences rather than education and inclusion so it is already a little more wonderful!
---
My apologies again for the super long reply but you had some really interesting points and I got carried away. Hope you have a good weekend and stuff! 
---
Welcome to Tyria, fellow adventurer! :)
---
Just wanted to point out, that it is possible to switch around Ascended and Legendary Gear (highest stat gears in the game) freely between characters, as long as they are the same armor class (Heavy, Medium, Light) and that you also can stat-swap your gear (armor and weapons at least) for very little cost (Ascended) or for free (Legendary), so it is not possible to waste thousands of hours on gear at least. Your Character's Traits and Skills can be switched for free anytime, too.
---
As for the profession choice, it heavily depends on what endgame content you would like to play, some are more preferred for Raids, while others are more preferred for WvW or PvP (Don't need any Gear for PvP btw, it works differently there).
---
The website that was already suggested here is a good starting point for choosing by build.
---
Though, you might end up with at least 1 of each profession eventually, I remember when I was breaking my head over what profession to go for years ago and here I am now, with 35 characters ;)
---
Just keep playing. PvP is fun. Don't be scared you'll drop, even if you start dropping, just keep playing. 
---
Yeah we just have to reroll whenever there are asinine balance changes or if the character we've played for thousands of hours is kept underpowered or nerfed for no good reason.
---
Guild Wars 2 really isn't immune to this. 
---
Nope, sorry.
---
Can I purchase the code off this website and use it on my EU account? Or will that not work? If that doesn't work does it mean that I MUST buy the code off an EU retailer? I play from EU but a friend was planning to gift me a code that she's gonna purchase from gamestop(US retailer) and I'll just warn her not to do that if it's not gonna work. 
---
Gw2 is very different from wow. Just choose a profession you like, they all shine if you play them well enough. And there‘s probably going to be new elite specs in the future for every class so you don‘t have to reroll when you want to try something new. 
---
I have a ranger since Day 1 and it‘s still my main character.

Welcome!  
---
My biggest piece of advice is the command /wiki. It can be used in a number of ways. Need to find an NPC? /wiki Hasara. (Or whatever the NPC's name is) Not sure where an item in your inventory is from, or what it's used for? /wiki shift+click the item. /wiki is your friend, make good use of it.  
---
Secondly, if you end up not liking your class, just shelve the character. Characters get birthday presents each year on the day of their creation. You also may enjoy the class later, or it may get changes to make it more interesting. You get enough hero points to unlock everything of your base class just by hitting max level, so feel free to get skills that look interesting as you level up.
---
since I missed the welcome back promo discount with a couple of hours and the a.net support refused to give me that discount after I sent a ticket, this was such a good news for me until I realized it was only for US! Damn it
---
You can refine them to lodestones though
---
Dungeon wise I found ac p2 to be the hardest
---
yes I use it this year. Got all achievements when they came out without any tools
---
At leurent I need it to block some of his attacks which can be very very deadly at times if I run out of dodges. At wurms I wanted to use littany, sadly I still had shelter as a skill from last run and forgot to swap it, welp.
---
I am not "probing" for either company, it was a general discussion question that came up in guild chat.in regards to games we have played, games that died, and what we would all do as individuals. I didn't realize there was a required amount of posts/comments that had to be made in order for an account to be regular. Please set aside your suspicions.
---
I've got a lovely tab names "Silence is Golden" for when I don't want to see what chat is saying 
---
Might not be instantly an another dragon. Anet has said they dont want the game to be constantly about the dragons because that goes stale pretty quickly. Chasing dragons one by one and moving from extreme weathers to another does seem like a pretty lame move.
---
We might focus some racial wars or conflicts for a while. 
---
Update arcdps first, then if it not helps disable "Best texture filtering" in game settings and try to find what causes this, maybe other arcdps extension.
---
I like the music.
---
And back?
---
Lovely art of a lovely boy!
---
You do not get pip bonus for higher mmr/rate.. Sorry, lol. Let me try to explain the system.
---
The pip rewards nor the titles themselves are not linked to “ranked divisions”. The pips are universal across division and the titles start at placements for the top 250 and above (As example the #1 finisher on the ladder each season gets the gods title “God/Goddess of PvP”)
---
So think of it like there are 2 main types of pvp’er... 
---
The Pip farmer and The title hunter.
---
They both play the same game (ranked PvP) but for vastly different reasons. 
---
One player loves the pip chests (ascended shards and blingy skins) and so they love participation rewards.
---
The other wants to have cleaner pvp without the loser/participation rewards that actually bring out the bots, the afk, and the quick to quit/talk shit pip farmers. 
---
(In old gw1 it was zero reward for losing in Pvp.... wtf you lost why get a prize? And why should there be now? When a losing reward encourages bad behavior like base quitting and afk and it’s killing the game mode from the inside out)
---
Pip farmers don’t play because they actually love PvP or want to get good or even to be better at whatever class mechanic/tactics (OR to even care about winning!) which is why most of us actually play.. Nope they only play PvP as a pip farm and more often then not “they aren’t playing... they are afk’ing” (because they still getting losing rewards so why tryhard when you get rewards for not trying at all)
---
So nope most PvP don’t pip farm because it kills your mmr swing and could potentially take a valuable title spot from you if you aren’t careful. We do something entirely different called “decay delay” (so you play a few matches every other day) and doing that protects your account rating while still giving you enough games by seasons end to stay on the active ladder. (Titles are for active ladder only)
---
Pip farming isn’t totally to blame for the problems with ranked PvP though..
---
I blame anet and truly the addition of the “participation rewards” (aka rewards for losing team) as what’s killed competitive spirit in spvp and brought out the afk/quick to quit player... stand in base and wait for rewards (for losing!) “pip farmer”... Embarrassing themselves in the process if you ask me.
---
It’s why in 2k19 most of the real big PvP players don’t play ranked and only come online for AT to get QP for mAT time and become a ghost the rest of the time. (The monthly has the huge 500g per player rewards and the other side of top PvP titles “best of the best”)
---
So anyway to summarize and answer your original question. No you do not get bonus pips by rank/rating (only the chance for PvP exclusive titles above top250).
---
Good luck with whatever you do and when you PvP please stay and be a title hunter!
---
(Not a pip farmer)

If you have a linked account and got a permanent ban on gw1 for botting (yes auto clicker is considered a bot in the old days).
---
Your linked gw2 account which uses the same password/email will most likely also be terminated/frozen.
---
Basically you are a botter trying to get your account back (is how support read the ticket).
---
I would honestly say.. You need new accounts and start fresh.
---
You won’t get lucky with anet response on gw1 and once you catch a legitimate perma it’s hard to get it removed.  (Read impossible)
---
If the original ban was wrong or overturned then maybe but you admit you used an auto clicker which has always been against user agreement (and everyone knew in the old days it was considered “automated” playing, aka botting before bots really)
---
Sooo get new gw2 account, login, play and have fun, and don’t go back to gw1.. its full of real bots now (and illegal gold/ecto seller spam)
---
Sorry but that’s how it goes with anet support tickets if they think you are a previously convicted gw1 botter (yes yes it’s autoclicker but that not how they see it)
---
After "putting thousand of hours" in GW2, if you're even interested in minmaxing and endgame PvE, you can easily retrait into any new elite spec in a matter of hours via tomes and HP trains, you're drowning in ascended gear and have enough gold to craft legendary gear. And if that's not enough - if you start now, by that time legendary sigils/runes will also be in the game.

 Thankfully there are no [unrealistic](http://www.artexpress.ws/UploadPic/Frank%20Frazetta/big/Conan%20the%20Adventurer.jpg) [body standards](http://karmaoldas.hu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Wallpaper.jpg) and [armor](https://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/he-man-970.jpg) for men in media, [especially](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/8/8f/Nightmare_Court_armor_%28light%29_human_male_front.jpg) [not in](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/c/ce/Feathered_armor_human_male_front.jpg) [Guild Wars 2](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/7/74/Warbeast_armor_%28light%29_human_male_front.jpg). :)
---
You have to think about target audiences too. Honestly, these ads wouldn't target non-gamers. The people who these ads target already have at least a passing knowledge of the games market and would probably have heard of GW2 in some way. A big part of GW2's appeal is its art style, so it's a good idea to showcase that. 
---
There are a lot of factors at play here. Target demographic,  platform limitations and division of funds. Why spend loads on a visually busy targeted ad campaign that will only show minimal returns anyway?  
---
if you wand a dps class go for thief, he has easy and forgiving rotations, 2 build variants (burst + steal utility or sustain dps) and could take the overpower trait to heal 20 % of your dmg for dropping some dps (if you got bad heal in squad)
---
if you wanna go for a healer, tempest is probably the easiest he has some build variants where staff is the more forgiving one with large coverage of your heal no other healer has this range, heal scourge also isnt that bad and can hard carry squads which get many downstates.
---
For supports, i definitely wouldn't recommend Chrono, not only is he one of the classes where you need more knowledge of the raid overall and the raid encounters compared to others but for a while, you always had to rebuild your gear and return rotations for the last balance patches.
---
Warrior is probably the easy "support", it would also be worth to take a look into the new firebrand/alacrene combo instant of taking a 2nd druid/chrono
---
Fantastic work, with a ryzen 2700x I went from mid-30's in busy city areas and wvw to mid 50's-60's and when roaming in open areas it'll go up to 170's-180's. Just a night and day difference in performance, I even turned up some of the detail and increased draw distance. 
---
If men were in video armored games like women
---
Make him play the B chord.
---
Typical butthurt people on this subreddit downvoting a criticism. 
---
No female armor in GW2 shows giant metal plating looking like pussy either.
---
dragonhunter is medicore at best on most raidbosses, he is much better for fractals where burst and utility is more valuable here.
---
if you wanna play guard firebrand is brobably the better option normaly
---
&gt;and Canach (the last of whom lost a bet with Dhuum  
---
LOOK SALAD BOY, A BET IS A BET, NOW GET IN THE BAG.
---
Yes, let me advice you: don't.
---
Contact mods of the subreddit and beg for pardoning. 
---
Any specific reason why? Is it because of the cripples on his skills and that multishot ooze thing that 1 shots you at close range, or something else?
---
&gt; go for thief
---
The rotations may be easy but bad positioning gets punished *hard* and you're so insanely squishy that I can't recommend thief to beginners. Daredevil in particular will lead to frustration being animation locked in Staff 2 for mechanics like the fire walls at Sabetha/SH or volatile poison at Slothasor.
---
&gt;Where do I start?
---
First: Read the [Happy Raider's Kit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7zlH3pVPvW21WIh5-qL-IXDeABtJzIqnZYXP8tCcM0/edit) for a primer. You don't need to do deep studying, but it's a great head start.
---
Second: Join a raid training discord server / guild. I'm biased towards [Raiders in Training](https://discordapp.com/invite/SvsVzVQ) (I train there, you see) but I've heard good things about Raid Academy and if you're in the EU you can join Raid Training Initiative or Crossroads Inn. On servers like these, experienced players will have all-players-allowed training runs to teach how bosses and raid wings work, and most of these trainers will be happy to teach you things about classes.
---
&gt;What class to pick (as a beginner)?
---
Your strongest Fractal character will definitely be accepted in raids, but most raiders try to keep a stable of characters that includes:
---
* **Power DPS**
---
* **Condition DPS**
---
* **Healer** (particularly Druid, but we'll see how the spirit rework impacts that)
---
* **Boon-based support** (Chrono, Alacrity Renegade, Quickness Firebrand)
---
* **Warrior** (every squad needs one because Banners are incredibly strong in ten-man content, even after their upcoming nerf)
---
There are a lot of options for the first three categories. Unfortunately ArenaNet in their [infinite wisdom](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infinite_Wisdom) decided to only let two classes reliably share the game-changing boon Alacrity (that most DPS characters assume they have while learning or practicing their rotation). Quickness is also considered mandatory, and only two classes can apply it consistently to their subgroup.
---
Now, in training guilds, you're not expected to be perfectly meta. Slothasor as a boss *highly* favors power damage, but if you join my training runs as a condition Soulbeast or whatever, we'll still take you. The important thing is learning the boss mechanics, and the desire to optimize and adapt to multiple situations will grow as you learn more of what you're doing. With that said, I think the best "my first classes" to learn raiding on are **the ones that are very fault-tolerant with forgiving rotations** because intricate rotations will distract you from learning the boss mechanics, which are by far the most important thing to learn in raids.
---
Also, the linked builds use full Ascended gear with stat infusions. You don't need that to start raiding. If your class uses precise infusions, compensate for that with precision food.
---
Finally, when it comes to picking your main category, the standard entry level composition is two healers, a Warrior with banners, and either two Chronomancers or the "Fire Brigade" (Alacrity renegade + either two quickness Firebrands or one FB and a chrono). If using Firebrands, they can also take simultaneously take the healer role. The remaining four or five slots go to general DPS, and some bosses favor power over condition or vice versa.
---
So with that preamble, here are my top recommendations for each category:
---
* **Power DPS:** [**Dragonhunter**](https://snowcrows.com/raids/guides/guardian/dragonhunter/power/). Full stop. The rotation is easy. Cooldowns are short with Alacrity, so if you mess up your tempo you can easily get your rotation back on track. You have a ton of active defense thanks to Focus 5, Shield of Courage, and the Litany of Wrath heal skill. You have access to range with your Scepter, so you can easily do mechanics that would force a full melee class to reposition (usually cleaving down problematic objects that spawn on fights). You bring a lot of CC. You don't need Spotter to hit the crit cap. It's even incredibly easy to gear, since it's full Berserker's gear.
---
* **Condition DPS:** [**Scourge**](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/condition/). Scourge is not a top tier condition DPS class, but is capable of trivializing adds on fights with the power of [Epidemic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Epidemic). Condition Scourge, like Power Dragonhunter, brings a ton of CC as well, which is important in beginner groups because you can't always rely on the support classes to break bars: those support classes are probably beginners too! Scourge's "rotation" is incredibly simple to get decent at but is harder to master, I would rank it similar to the Dragonhunter in that regard. Like the Dragonhunter, it's quite easy to recover from a misclick or rotation break. Also like the Dragonhunter, you have access to ranged damage built into your optimal kit. Scourge is also very resilient thanks to its high health pool and access to barriers. All Condition DPS classes use Viper's gear, which is a bit harder to acquire than Berserker's.
---
* **Healer:** This is one that's harder to make a direct recommendation for. [**Druid**](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/druid/heal/) is the "gold standard" due to Spirits and easy ten-man Might but what a lot of people don't realize is that *Druid healing is actually not great*. Experienced groups won't need more healing than what a Druid is capable of, but "off-healers" are incredibly welcome in beginning runs. You can of course learn and play Druid, the class isn't particularly difficult. Keep in mind, though, that Druids are also often responsible for kiting or other such mechanics due to the mobility afforded to them by Ancestral Grace. As far as other healers go, you can run an off-healer alongside a Druid to maintain the advantage of Spirits so you shouldn't have any problem bringing one of the following classes into a training run: [**Healing Scourge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPFU28vh5vY) is incredibly survivable and scales incredibly well in weak groups. You'll be forced to learn positioning, because if you're out of position and transfuse allies, they will die and you will be sad. This is a good thing. [**Staff Tempest**](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest_-_Support_Healer) is probably the easiest class to do *something* useful with, and that *something* is raw healing. Just big, raw, consistent healing. Similarly, the healing [**Herald**](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/herald/heal/) or [**Renegade**](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/heal/) builds also provide massive sustain alongside some pretty valuable other things (Notably, heal Renegade can flex into providing Alacrity to ten players by changing one trait, thus filling the Healer and Boon Support role at the same time). Healing [**Firebrand**](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/heal/) is in a similar place: A strong burst healer with unique advantages (aegis and stability spam) that can also simultaneously be a part of the Boon Support role by providing Quickness to its five man subgroup. Healer classes tend to use either Magi or Harrier gear, or some mix of the two. Magi's gear is easier to acquire and cheaper, but full Magi with no boon duration is only used on classes focused *purely* on raw healing rather than boons: the staff Tempest and the heal Scourge.
---
* **Boon Support:** As I've already mentioned healing **Firebrand** and **Renegade**, I'll take a short moment to say that you can easily provide Quickness *without* being a healer as Firebrand (the [Power DPS](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/power%20quickness/) variant in particular is almost identical to the Power Dragonhunter, and you don't need to worry about using Flame Legion runes over Scholars if you want to main Dragonhunter but flex into Power Quickbrand), and Alacrity without being a healer as [Renegade](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/alacrity/). If you're not interested in playing Firebrand or Renegade, there is *one* option for you in this class type: [**Boonshare Chronomancer**](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/support/). This build can provide quickness *and* alacrity to its subgroup, but is reliant on a second Boonshare Chronomancer in the other subgroup also using Signet of Inspiration to extend boons squad-wide. It can also run alongside the Alacrity Renegade / Firebrand duo in the other subgroup, using Mimic and the Well of Action to maintain Quickness (since the pressure to upkeep Alacrity is gone as the Renegade hits all ten squad members). This build is also the de facto tank class, simply take Giver or Minstrel gear to up your Toughness (bosses with stat-based aggro all aggro on highest toughness) and use your myriad blocks, distorts, and dodges to avoid incoming damage. Chronomancer is not recommended as a first raid build, because it's quite complex to play and constantly requires regearing due to balance patches.
---
* **Warrior:** Yep, it's Warrior. [**Power**](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/warrior/banner/). [**Condi**](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/banner/). Power is easier to gear and play. Each squad only needs one of these, so don't make this your VERY FIRST build and expect to always have a slot in the composition.
---
I'm not sure how to do that.  A few months ago I posted a similar request, and one of the mods just blew me off.  I don't know what to do. :-(
---
What's the hardest/possible dungeon(s) to solo on Ele?
---
Condi shortbow/shortbow Soulbeast. You basically just to press every skill/swap weapon on cooldown. Effective for pretty much every boss except the first and last bosses of Wing 6.
---
Why would someone who runs RivaTuner+MSI also run FRAPS?
---
And please tell me that uncapped FPS is just for testing sake. Seriously over working your GPU if not.
---
now they gona use card with time travel or some shit.
---
There is difficult mechanics that you want to deal with while also keeping up your dps. Raiding is full of them. Great example is that sometimes you have to jump over something, and you can still channel a skill while doing so and mastering this will make your dps output slightly better. 
---
Mechanics are hard bur ofc become easy after you practice and keep repeating them, just like anything in life. 
---
This game does have challenging elements in Story, even though it does not punish you. Thrive for achievements. Thats where real challenges are at. Sadly gw2 story is built around super bad casuals so the difficulty is added artificially via achies.
---
Core story is really simple though. 
---
People downvote anything they don't care to see, don't take it personally. Happens to everything.
---
Dont think that story will make us die anymore. 
---
Wow thanks for the detailed reply! 
---
I have a similar problem with Asura. I create one, play for a while, then think how much more I like Charr. However, this time around I am interested in the different dialog I have heard happens between an Asura commander and Taimi vs a non-Asura commander. 
---
Gotta be a responsible gun owner!
---
extremely welcome everywhere until you have two beginners that only play power bannerslave. It's a more common scenario than you'd think in raid training! I'd recommend picking up Warrior after you have a regular power or condi DPS character you can play if someone else can only bring banners.
---
Alright, thanks.

all graphs in uS
---
frame time = sync + exec + prep
---
prep = game code + overhead
---
While i can see some spikes on resource allocation overhead, there is more of them. Looks like game code. 
---
You can try and set more agressive pooling config to cut that spikes.
---
You see list of subreddit mods on sidebar and if they did blew you off and denied you already, then theres nothing you can do I am afraid. Theres plenty of ways to get new people to play with other than that discord so hope isnt lost. 
---
Better shoes!!!!
---
I haven't really found any examples on Google, and I guess the clipping issue could explain why everybody wants short ears. 
---
I sent a message to the mods, I didn't know that was an option.  I hope I will be shown some mercy; thanks.
---
Don't forget to check out raid training servers, for the HoT bosses we tend to be very forgiving with new raiders in exotic gear, so long as they try their best and listen to instructions.
---
strange things...
---
Funny thing is, Female heavy armor in Gw2 look both feminine and looks like it should do the job of protecting the user.
---
Besides Scallywag and Gladiator, all armors do hold a feminine design while looking functional : they show some skin, but it's not some battle bikini and covers vital organs. 
---
Scallywag and Gladiator could also be argued to not be standard battle armor because the name Scallywag suggests usage by pirates, and sinking with full plate armor is gonna drown the user, and Gladiator fights are more of an exhibition so maybe that's why it shows more skin and covers less. 
---
I actually really like the Asura cultural armor. Much more so than Charr, that's for sure. If I stick with this character I am going to have to restrain myself from spending the gold on the Tier 3, which is Zojja's outfit. 
---
Well it was just one of them, I think.  I hadn't used the "message the mods" option yet.  It's just so nice to have a Discord server to ask questions in, suggestions in, etc.  How would I find a new guild?  I dunno. 
---
We'll see.  Thanks.
---
Except posting on the subreddit telling the thousands of players yu are new is not actually obligatory. 
---
/r/guildrecruitment has people posting guilds. Find a large one with experienced people in it and im sure they help you out with questions. 
---
Yeah, and all these spots  where you can get under the map :D
---
It's kind of rare for someone to have a fully geared Viper warrior but not *any* sort of power class, due to the barrier to entry that's present on Viper's gear but not Berserker's. 
---
&gt; dps elitist
---
legit fuck this.
---
for real now. yeah i kick people if they have about 60% bench without doing mechanics. do you want to know the reason why? cause its unfair for the rest of the squad who actually put effort in this
---
&gt;decent dps
---
asking for a good dps isnt a sin. if i ask for a dps i expect a good one
---
i guess you also bought the xpacs from official retailers? just to be sure you haven't bought a shady key.
---
If you enjoy pvp you can easily accumulate hundreds of Tomes of Knowledge's which reward an entire level each
---
I have a mirage but I'm not good at it. I've found I trade off survivability for DPS when going SB.
---
Maybe i missed some overhead tracking but looks like all is on places.
---
Power Dragonhunter is considered meta on six out of the eleven Heart of Thorns bosses, which are *overwhelmingly* likely to be a newbie raider's experience. Of the first four wings, the only boss where Dragonhunter is considered *bad* is Matthias due to that boss's mechanics *greatly* favoring the most extreme DPS class in the game right now: Mirage (Due to the way Mirage functions, it's either ass or insane at a given boss, with very few bosses being "just okay" for it).
---
For Wings 5 and 6, though, Dragonhunter is pretty weak. Soulless Horror is a condition boss, Dhuum also is weaker to conditions than power, Conjured Amalgamate can't be hit by Sword of Justice during his burn phase, Largos is a condition boss (again overwhelmingly favoring Mirage), and Qadim has a murder hitbox under him that prevents you from properly executing the Dragonhunter's biggest DPS dealer: Whirling Wrath.
---
it sounded exactly like in source material:Solo: Star Wars Story (had about same amount of *fun* lvl there)
---
Fun clip. Whats with the 999 baubles?
---
Daredevil potentially, but only with Invigorating Precision for a new player and as Nico points out, the animation locks on Weakening Charge can be an absolute pain. However Daredevil is generally quite accepted in training and pug groups currently.
---
Definitely not dagger/dagger Deadeye though due to the very strict positioning requirements, lower sustain, lower single target DPS, lower cleave DPS, greater group dependence and a more finickity rotation due to revealed timing and maximising. Rifle Deadeye really shouldn't be considered at all for a new player hoping to be accepted in groups.
---
You're one person. A lot of overlays don't work with it, and there are issues with the character screen
---
That'll certainly take a long time, but tengu share a base rig with charr, and that'll speed up the process a whole lot.
---
They'll need tweaks mostly on pieces of armor with exposed forearms to fit the arm feathers. 
---
I think Hobby Dungeon Explorer needs explorable mode, so I'll give AC P3 a go solo, cheers!
---
The game is free. Just start playing it and you'll have the answer to all of these questions except the order of the expansions. Since the expansions are almost completely pointless until after you've leveled up to lvl80, you have lots of time to figure that out.
---
Create a new discord account, reset your router so you get a new IP address, and log on.
---
fuck i want that for my charr
---
Whatever the context this is the most metal thing I've read all year
---
when you're such an embarrassment even inanimate objects are disassociating from you
---
Just git gud. No other way around. Slacking off with lesser rotations leads to bad habits.
---
I got to gold 2 placement for few last seasons. First season (2 ago) I was silver 3. 
---
I was fine with it, I've been playing PvP ranked games so long I no longer care what rank I am as long I stay in decent level and it doesn't feel unbalanced. And I don't claim to be "diamond if it wasn't for my team!!".
---
Now I got placed plat 1 and oh boy was it bad. I lost all my games after that and fell to gold 2.
---
Felt bad being deadweight to my team cos I got trained hard for doing gold mistakes :/
---
You didnt even remotely come close to answering his question.
---
I've got a lop-eared mesmer. But mines doesnt have a headpiece (only the Tiara) :)

---
Rotations can't be simplified if yu wish to perform better. 
---
If yu wish to cut down on steps in a rotation then don't expect spectacular damage. 
---
Yea, some do, some do not. [Backpack Regenerator](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Backpack_Regenerator) doesn't trigger the rune, [Rapid Regeneration](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rapid_Regeneration) does. It's very inconsistent, but hey it's ANet. 
---
Thing is, a perfect rotation doesn't help if you're dead, so you have to start easy and ramp things up step by step.
---
It's no use if you try to learn all things at once, it's better to split it up into multiple parts that can be learned individually and mashed together as soon as you understand how the individual parts work.
---
I mean, sure, I could give you an entire 100+-step-rotation to learn a new build, but
---
A) We're in 2019, not 2016, and
---
B) What do you do if you lack Alacrity for a second? Whoops, the rotation is fucked up, you have no clue how to get back into your rotation as quickly as possible - In this case it's MUCH better to know simplified rotations that do not interfere with the "optimal" rotation regarding CDs, and if you learn rotations by adding more and more skills into it step by step, then you already have exactly that in your head without having to think about what to do next. And yes, fuckups happen, so it's realistic to assume their existence and to prepare for them by learning simplified rotations as well.
---
Do you mean /r/guildwars2 or just guildwars2? None are official, the Reddit one is quite good the other one is pretending to be official and is for special snowflakes.

I invite you to post in the same thread on the forum and/or submit a ticket.
---
Thank you!

I think it's the Reddit Discord for GW2.  
---
ah so i will want to use it on my bag opener character and then find all the items with runes/sigils and use it on them?
---
Must be a scrapping mirage holo
---
Should I open and salvage or simply salvage the new unidentified gear?
---
**SAB** stands for : **S**uper **A**ggravating **B**ounce
---
DH is not a very complicate rotation and you need to understand what your modifiers are (like for any power class) and yes indeed if you had to cut your rotation for mechanics, rez or whatever reason you should go back to your rotation to a burstier step, which is the idea behind most power builds. And as with most builds understanding your most important skills (or skill combinations) and the general idea of the rotation helps recover from an interruption and perform better than strictly resuming your rotation from what is written.
---
Welcome to HoT, this was almost everyone’s first experience and don’t worry PoF is more friendly. First is to learn the enemies, if you are still in the first areas some of the ones I struggled agains a lot are pocket raptors (just keep an eye out for them and aoe them down) and the mordant snipers; the key to them is dodging their shots when they put a crosshair over your head. Second is gear, exotics will help a lot and having gear that helps your build will be good, decide if you want to focus on power or condition damage and go from there.
---
A note about stats, generally the trade off you get from defensive stats aren’t worth it, it is better to go full beserkers or vipers because you lose much more offense than defense. The best places I find to look for getting more defensive (in the order of importance) skills, traits, and then weapon type. It has been a long while (since before PoF came out) that I have played my ranger so I don’t have specific advice.
---
You do know that we go into keeps, keep the NPC lord alive so that we can farm and kill more players right? This happens for up to 20+ min sometimes. Fighting servers care nothing for NPCs or PvE events. We ignore them and go find groups of people to fight. Because that's why we play WvW. End of story. 
---
It should not hit over 100%
---
Returning player here after 2 years. Currently working on the twilight, because that's where I left off. Other than that, is there something I could be doing that's over soon? Like SAB? 
---
Is the Necro buffed? I remember it being quite bad for PVE, but maybe it changed.
---
If you can't afford a shared inventory space then yeah a bag opener (where most of your green gear will appear) is the best idea.
---
yeah it doesnt seem too complicated, lots of repetitions in it. in an actual raid situation where cc is needed wouldnt it be better to skip the Dragon's maw trap and use it when cc is needed?
---
To be  fair they are both England roatetd upside down
---
The most helpful thing I was told while learning mirage was that maintaining clones is more important than shatters. That's not to say you shouldn't shatter at all, but there's a reason people say you should only shatter when you have a way to quickly replenish all 3 clones. The extra condis they apply on their auto chains and ambush skills are worth a lot. So if you're having trouble keeping track of your "shatter economy" so to speak, just use the f2-f1 combo off cooldown and keep 3 clones up in the meantime.
---
any logs to share?
---
thank you!
---
Lol why putting Bubbles backwards 😂
---
&gt; Rotations can't be simplified if yu wish to perform better
---
rotation A is super complex and does 20k dps when botched, which is easy to do
---
rotation B is simple and does 25k when nailed, which is easy to do
---
rotations can't be simplified if you wish to perform *optimally*
---
It depends on the fight but in general I would say so indeed for example I wouldn't save it specifically to CC on KC but I would save it or delay it for VG, Gorse, Sloth or Samarog. And in fight where CC is needed quite a lot commiting your Bane Signet might be worth it too (even without the Perfect Inscription trait) because a faster CC on Samarog or Sloth for example can result in a better/safer kill.
---
I love the underwater combat in GW2. Especially WvW is hilarious if you see all the cheese builds flail around helplessly.
---
&gt; lower sustain
---
idk if 6k self heal per second is not enough i don't think any other build would give more
---
&gt; greater group dependence
---
he is less depending on groups i would say since he doesn't need spotter, can get perma fury on his own and some quickness if chrono doesn't have Perma coverage
---
&gt; finickity rotation 
---
not sure how 3 auto chains with 1 backstab after on repaid is hard to execute.
---
And for the bosses you normally use daredevil for positioning shouldn't be hard 
---
SAB is the reason I quit gw2. Enjoy your free gold people.
---
You're missing out on deaths.

I do remember seeing people back in the day do a en mass walk of Quaggans. I use to join in even if it was near the end. Man I love quaggans and  should find a guild who love them as well. As they’re amazing little creatures 
---
At that point why not just ask for a mount with true flight. Easier then adding updrafts throughout Tyria. Also are you asking for Griffon with updraft ability? Cause you can just Bond of Faith into an updraft, then glide, and remount at the top.
---
Only real things can disappear.
---
Play your favorite build, but also look into "meta" builds to see if there's something you like. Some professions have a spec that feels like garbage elsewhere but really feels good in PvP, so you might discover something you like more.
---
PvP is such a good gold farm AND it's fun. Just don't run into matches thinking "oh I'm gonna win this!" just go in aiming to improve yourself and do your best. Maybe you win, maybe not. There's no real penalty for losses (and actually, based on matchmaking, the more you lose, the more likely you'll have easy games that you win)
---
Oh wow - love seeing my videos pop up on reddit &lt;3 
---
* Action cam* I know everyone has told you :3 &lt;3 
---
What a coincidence I just saw another post talking about a Blade and Soul streamer that decided to try GW2.
---
Check gw2 style 
---
This is so unaccurate. Deadeye is currently lower dps and has a harder (proper) rotation than Daredevil. It also requires more positional awareness and doesn't have stolen skills. Just autoattacking as Deadeye isn't going to teach good habits, never mind do passable damage.
---
For condition, Mirage is recommended because of the way confusion works. It is so overpowered on the condi recommended bosses that even if you play it poorly you are going to be ahead of a condi berserker while being far safer due to all the evade frames. 
---
OH FUCK. man that was a good laugh, ty
---
Thanks you for the elaborate answer! Some really useful tips :)
---
Can’t deconstruct, but most forges need lodestones anyways so there’s no point in keeping silvers
---
Thanks for the reply! Last question if you don't mind. What are some common high tier goals atm? Are most people working towards legendaries or AP? Or is there something else?
---
this is funny, considering simplified condiholo is kind of meta :)
---
I don't understand why people don't want to killl kralk yet. Personnally i have had my fill of him and now is the perfect time to kill him.
---
We had brand in 2 core maps then 4 pof then the branded had a presence in almost all the living world maps. We have been in the presense of kralk 2 times once stopping balth then ofcourse uus fighting him. I really think his time is up.
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted, I fully agree with you. SAB does a better job at implementing game design that rewards exploration and experimenting within the zone. Like trying to find chests shovels, hidden rooms with bombs, secret holes underground, labyrinths. 
---
Doubling the effects of banners is completely selfish though, it doesn't benefit allies.
---
I've been slowly farming my way to the blue/red infusions by spamming tribulation runs, and each success gives you a ton of baubles! I'm sitting on something like 40 bauble bubbles now, but there's not too much I want to buy from the vendors :[
---
you can complete every HP on world then buy the heroic notary from wvw or just buy 189 heronic notary from wvw and have no worry about HP in core maps
---
&gt; I never said that ai couldn't do it 
---
Thanks for the laugh, I guess the thread was written by your little sister?
---
&gt; but circlejerking for attention sure is easy to do. 
---
I'll take that from the expert who opened this thread to do excactly this.
---
Thanks, it worked. Looks like it's dx9, it seems I cant get it to install properly and I have no clue what I am doing wrong. 
---
You can't go too far wrong with a power Holosmith. Great damage, good burst, great CCs, effective against pretty much every boss. You'll have to learn a little kit swapping, but it's way easier than condi Holo.
---
If that's not your style, Dragonhunters are consistently valued for their extreme burst damage, and they're arguably a little easier to play than power Holo. You can find builds for both at [Snowcrows' website](https://snowcrows.com/).
---
Yup, I did buy few prepaid cards from gamestop while I was shoping because they had a deal, but according to Anet gamestop is official retailer so I do not think thats it.
---
Racial skills are mainly just for flavor.  There are a few tricks that can be pulled off like Soulbeast(Ranger) + Norn Elite burst, but nothing really worth building a character around.  You'll get more enjoyment out of creating characters you enjoy thematically/aesthetically.
---
Fuck that, I love warclaws
---
Do you use reshade or anything like that?
---
you can use mounts while transformed?
---
Nice Teeth...

If you want to play druid you should go for sylvari, other than that it doesnt matter
---

---
SE p1 is made of nightmares and anguish unless you take a really casual look at it
---
Hotw p1 would also be an excellent choice for self traumatizing experience
---
Right, but the only reason you'd ever take banners is to help people. Even if they nerfed it, it doesn't make much sense in a line all about improving bursts, weapon swapping, etc.

---
 How is the leveling on this game? I'm not a fan of questing, I prefer doing pvp or dungeons. Is that possible?
---
 \- What others said but let me add: this game is somewhat different from a lot of mmo's in that the quests/missions are just there: you arrive in an area and get a notification that you can help so and so. no need to talk to quest giver or anything like that (this is the hearts mission system). there are also dynamic meta events that appear often and which are open world; many players can and do come to join when metas are up. It is very easy to level up in all modes and doing just metas is very fast as well. 
---
 Also, how. Is pvp end game? Is there open world pvp? 
---
\- (don't know about 5 on 5 pvp but) open world pvp is WvW which is a mix of PVE and PVP where three factions (servers) fight for control of territory. this is a lot of fun. 
---
How about pve, are there raids end game or just dungeons for 5 people? 
---
\- There are dungeons for 5 people (fractals), raids for i dont know how many, i dont do those but i know they are the traditional kind where you need a team, certain gear, etc., and then there are a lot of bigger meta events and world bosses where you don't need to join a group, you can just show up and take part.
---
Lastly, which expansion do I need to buy? Is path of fire the last one or heart of thorns? 
---
\- for the best experience you need both because path of fire gives you mounts (you have to work for them a bit, though)  and heart of thorns gives you gliders. I played free to play for a while and was ok with the game, but when i got the mounts and the glider, the entire experience changed and i began to love the game.  
---
Not really: with the trait, banners offer more personal stats than signets so if even if you're solo in the open world they are a very strong choice.
---
Really hate scrapper as a concept now and wish somehow gyros actually were gyros... wells give me a break. Concept is simple now even though it’s infinitely more effective. 
---
Is it safe for use? Will i get banned for it? 
---
That's it, HoM. You get skins, titles, and ranger pets
---
Doesn’t that just make gliding redundant though...
---
I wonder what 60% bench is is in this context. Per-boss benchmark or golem benchmark? Cause if the latter, oh boy you're gonna be kicking a lot of people on a lot of bosses. 
---
And I think good support is way more integral to good DPS than the good dps classes, and good dps *players* are more integral to good DPS than classes, even if good DPS players tend to trend towards the 'good' DPS classes. Not always, though. 
---
Be wary though a lot of stuff on metabattle can be outdated, especially if there’s been some balance patches
---
A limited time festival literally in the corner of the world is the reason you left the game
---
And if you use the basic salvage kits, is it still worth opening and then salvaging using them?
---
"God Walking Amongst Mere Mortals" also gets transferred.
---
For DH: 
---
Dragon's Maw, Binding Blades, Bane Signet especially if you have traited for Perfect Inscriptions... 
---
Don't underestimate it. It's not what Chrono used to be, or a core warrior level of CC, but it's quite a bit compared to some other builds. 
---
Is this a copypasta or did you write this all up just for this post. It should be a copy pasta I'm sure. This is quite nice and detailed.
---
holo feels like what Warrior shoud have been.
---
I don't think so Anet wouldn't have released that teaser if this was the case. I'm actually thinking the two stories will be the current events if I'm honest. They probably thought these would be better in game immortalised so that players can do them in game. My prediction is this month for 2 reasons. 2 months after this is July when Season 2 and Season 3 began. Also They are wrapping up the development and when they have said this in the past that means a few weeks after they say this. I predict War Eternal end of April or hell they could change this and surprise us by releasing the current events on Tuesday (if there is a patch). The trailer the following week and then the release of the finale.
---
It's more effective, but the spec is still half-baked. Support-wise it's not very good (doesn't provide many boons). Heal scrapper is only effective because base engi provides the healing.
---
Artistically, you can still tell it was it an afterthought due to small things like how it has no unique UI art, and all of its trait icons are still coloured the same as base engi traits (I know that last one is silly, but it sticks out once you look).
---
The elite spec mechanic is still one of the most underwhelming ones. The finisher isn't useful in pve, and the rez is only useful if things are already going bad. Targeting with the function gyro during a fight is poorly-designed. You can't rez manually without first wasting the gyro. 
---
The benefits you cite for support are eclipsed by healing chronos.
---
I've had the most luck playing it as straight dps. Not as good as holo, but more durable at least.
---
Chrono is a great place to start.
---
-	No mechanical responsibilities
---
-	Easy to gear. You won’t have to get multiple sets of armor.
---
-	Rarely gets patched so you’ll never have to learn a new rotation.
---
-	People will let you transition to a different role whenever you want!
---
SurprisedAsuraFace.jpeg
---
What are you talking about? The only thing scrapper has over firebrand is perhaps bulkwark to absorb damage and some amount of barrier. However, firebrand has ageis and much more heal. In wvw, firebrand still has irreplaceable place in squad even after the scrapper update.
---
It's just OP at the moment.  Probably why it feels that way.
---
Most other classes are fine to have multiple off though, while warrior doesn't really fill that role (I guess both could bring 1 banner, but is their DPS worth it?)
---
Isnt that the point of elite spec, to alter the playstyle of a class?
---
Out of curiosity, what mechanics do you think Holo has that Warrior doesn't?
---
By mechanics i mean "concepts", like the ones i listed above, not just numerical dps.
---
There's a difference between having and wanting to play. BS is easy to play in raids and quite hardy, unlike say power DD or Holo (for a beginner that is)
---
It's the same reason  why I default to playing druid... it is simple and I feel useful without having to worry too much about my rotation.
---
Playing your favorite build instead of meta only works if your class doesn't vary much between builds. For thief for example if you don't play meta it's very hard to be as effective as a meta build.
---
No fuck you. Peta troll
---
Berserker in PvP!? What is this!? A dream !?
---
I’m mesmerized. This looks great! 
---
I'd like to know what mmo everyone came from before coming to gw2 where "raid training" is a thing.  Every mmo I ever played we organized and just killed the boss or didnt.  You learned as you fought it.  I've seen lots of training raids that spend all day teaching and then specifically tell people that "we arent going for any kills today".... wtf?
---
Awesome, thanks team. 
---
Very cool.
---
Was glad to hear certain tracks reused. Knowing that there are homages everywhere is good news. 
---
thank you for the detailed response
---
when you say other classes might outperform to what extent is that? also yeah being careful on when you use the axe 5 is very important.
---
i think a warrior will fit perfectly since i can do support and condi dps as well. even if it isnt mirage
---
While I understand that, from my personal experience of bringing guildies and friends into PvP, the only way to get them to stay for longer than a few games is to have them play something they intrinsically enjoy playing rather than a "meta build".
---
When you play meta it is because you intent to give yourself every absolute possible advantage possible you can think of to edge an increase in the win %, no matter how small it is, so basically you are putting off fun for a chance of winning. The problem comes when you dont win, in which case you are neither having fun playing a build, nor having fun with the mode. It is double frustration.
---
Best you can do is help them with some traits and weapons within the limits of things they enjoy playing, and try to craft the best possible build possible while they have fun, win or lose. 
---
PvP is more of a grind. If you want rating just play one of those braindead strong classes and grind your way to the top, but the average Joe wont last long until it is burned out.
---
And that is a problem!
---
HEEEEEEEEEEEEEYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYEEEEEEEEEEEY EY EY
---
HEYYYA HEE
---
The keybind can be for any mount or chair novelty, it does not have to be the mount on are stuck on.
---
Works fine there too, just checked it in game. It seems like you don't understand the steps for the workaround. You don't just hit dismount. You need to use the mount specific keybind(or chair) then dismount. For the dismount it can be the Mount/Dismount keybind or the specific keybind.
---
I like that, only make it remap movement keys. That's manageable but still obnoxious and a weakness.
---
You don't need to keep it / there's nothing you can do with it. It's from the old, old, super old pvp reward system. Safe to trash :) 
---
I was mainly referring to knowing which encounters would need the trait swap, but maybe that's beside the point. You're certainly correct in what you say, but the fact remains that most classes don't have to make those kind of decisions.
---
To give examples: Weaver, Holosmith, Chronomancer, Mirage, Reaper, Daredevil and power revenant build all have access to more CC without significant disruption to their rotations or DPS. And if we take into account all the CC dragonhunter can bring, it still falls behind Holosmith, Chronomancer, Mirage, Reaper, Scourge, power revenant builds, daredevil and spellbreaker. 
---
So it is firmly in the middle of the pack and hence it's misleading to ascribe "tons of CC" to the class.
---
strong jojo energy
---
Human, you mean. The facial structure isn't norn
---
It's not a duelist build so doesn't really matter. As a rev you need to keep moving and destroying people together with your team. Anything that doesn't have conditions should be beatable however.
---
Truly outrageous. &lt;3
---
There's an update that just came out that might fix it for all.
---
https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases/tag/v0.9.8.1b
---
If it's still acting up, come join us on the Discord and we'll help you make a detailed crash report.
---
Another RiT trainer here. Can confirm that Nico's comment is all great info and worth listening to. 
---
However, I might argue that Daredevil isn't something to be afraid of on the basis of how squishy it is, as being squishy will help teach you to position properly. Further, DH will also get downed fairly easily if the player doesn't move out of the damage. Both are still great choices.
---
Another suggestion for power DPS is holosmith. Personally I use the kitless sword variant - this isn't technically meta as you lose some theoretical dps compared to the rifle build, but you get it back in practice due to the simplicity of the rotation. The build has even more cc potential than DH, as you have the option to swap in certain utilities like battering ram and bomb kit - a holo can spike over 900 cc damage in under two seconds if they know what they're doing. The other nice thing here is that you have 15k health and access to AED, which is a heal skill that will instantly heal you to 80% of your health if you would have gone into downstate in the moments following its use. It's basically a personal rebound, and can be exceptionally useful when learning fights.
---
Anyways, tons of info for you to digest - best of luck with your journey into raids, and maybe I'll see you in one of my trainings!
---
Try Beta v0.9.8.1 - https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases/tag/v0.9.8.1b
---
Good point. There are indeed all over the place. But on the other hand it allows you to make weird build with no right to work, but they actually do. 
---
Very She-Ra.
---
Pushed some fixes, if it continues, send d912pxy/log.txt and crash&lt;XX&gt;.txt
---
Try the latest build. It may have fixed the issue. If not, come join us on Discord and we'll help you make some detail logs to help find the cause.
---
what if phantasms and clones are just STANDS? omg.
---
Thanks for the info. Happy cake day!
---
I think scrapper and guardian fit their own theme pretty well. Scrapper by definition is: a fighter or aggressive competitor, especially one always ready or eager for a fight, argument, or contest. The hammer train feels exactly that with rocket charge and thunderclap. Whereas guardian has the blue light theme and provide lots of block and heals. However, just like you have your opinion, this is my opinion. It is all up to our own opinion.
---
Youre not the only one lol. Warrior traits just feel like they were thrown into a hat and pulled something out and said this will go in the line
---
There's 3 traits in particular that I always wanted shuffled around:
---
* Burning Arrows moved from tactics to Arms.
---
* Double Standards moved to Tactics.
---
* Then a trait moved from Arms to Discipline.
---
 * It used to be a trait that changed, so that won't do anymore. 
---
 * Now I'd go with moving a less used trait like Dual Wielding to Discipline, and rework it into a trait that gives a benefit on weapon swap.
---
Not just face, Norns are way thicker, arms, breasts and waist.
---
...You're thinking about quitting the game because there are skins you want that comes from a game mode that you don't enjoy. Really.
---
You're seriously arguing that it's wrong for certain skins to be available only to people with the skill to obtain them... but in the same breath, you're asking for a *different* type of festival/minigame with nice rewards? Why don't people who are good at jumping puzzles deserve to be rewarded for their skill and effort, but people who are good at strategy-related minigames (like you proposed) do?
---
JPs frustrate me, too, but if someone else is good at them, I have no problem with seeing them obtain rewards for that! Maybe you could try actually being happy for other people instead of envying them? It would make the world a little bit better all around if we could all just do that.

Tell that to the Black Lion "Salvage Kit". If you use that on any piece of gear with a rune or sigil, you will get that sigil/rune. The function of that Salvage Kit has not changed. I use them all the time for salvaging exotic level items to receive sigils/runes.

With those numbers no wonder your team lost, what was your team armed with? Pool noodles?
---
My team makeup was me (Berserker), 2 Core Rangers, 1 Chronomancer Mesmer, and a Core Elementalist. However, the other team had pretty much the same thing.
---
I think we were armed with [Feather Duster]s, they’re better for dexterity and torment but terrible for condi damage. [Pool Noodle] is a common, but I think it got buffed last time they added a new world to SAB, so I don’t think being armed with them would be a handicap.
---
He does speed clears so he's probably a top player though.
---
Bought/sold are not accurate on gw2bltc because the API does not have a way to distinguish between cancelled orders and filled orders. In this case it might be that someone who had a buy order listed for less than yours cancelled theirs.
---
what engine?
---
There are Bloodstone Rings from LW3S1. And I think Lake Doric has earrings.
---
next: russian characters.
---
this is already a feature, but you have to have the drunk effect from over drinking lol
---
I acquired almost everything I wanted in this game. Everything beside those skins. 
---
The fact that I'm not able to reach my goal, to finish my fashion wars, is making me quit. Because why should I even bother, when devs just block my path to something by inconsistent rule? There are multiple ways to obtain different things in this game, but not here.
---
I don't say that people who are good at jumping puzzles do not deserve to be rewarded for their skill and effort. They are. 
---
What I'm saying is, that there are no ways for people with strategic thinking, or any other gaming-ralated ability that isn't agility, to obtain something nice here. And such people aren't even able to workaround this with gold, or with help from someone else.
---
I would be very happy to play some strategy-related minigame, and  would be more than happy to help people who are not so good strategists to finish it, in exchange for help with trib mode. 
---
But I don't even have opportunity to do so. And this is making me upset.
---
Guess who will be served with a lawsuit from anet pretty soon? (6)

Maybe that's their problem then?
---
Ah the good ol' double ranger strat, where both of them are dead for 75% of the match
---
Wrong sub?
---
whole photon forge is basicly 10x better berserker,you get NEW  5 skills,extreme dmg from melle and from range,insane ccs. + holo can ofc pull,push and play dps. warrior is obviously most hated in anet,even a fucking necro get  5 new skills when entering shroud/reaper and war? fuck your  20 banners skills XD
---
Wat
---
They should rename it to Bug Construct.
---
Don't worry, I'm not putting twilight in the game at all. I just pulled over the textures to make it look like this since I thought it was cool.
---
did you upload the wrong pic or something?
---
Rapid regeneration effects med, so not all of it is from base engi, in wvw it provides plenty of boons because of converting conditions into them as well as just having a ton of condition cleansing ability 
---
Unity. Although pretty much any engine would support it. 
---
Laurels would be your fastest options (and you most likely have enough saved already to buy a ring or 2/trinket)
---
If you have done PoF+Ls4, u may wanna check out ls4ep2- sandswept isles, often forgotten but a really easy ascended ring and trinket can be obtained there for vm+map currency.

---
By being a dirty casual. That’s how.
---
Seems like im a bit late, but ill throw in my few cents.
---
I play power mirage when im just stalking tags for bags. Gs is actually really good sustained dmg, since its aa isnt a projectile, has 1200 range, and does increased dmg the farther you are from the enemy. Gs 3 has boon removal, 2 and 4 are great burst tools, and 5 is great for memeing and pushing people off cliffs. As for utilities, if the tag needs veils/illusions then i run it, but if they dont ask, i grab feedback+mimic to pad my dps.
---
Jaunt+blink+mirage thrust also allows you to easily reposition/escape if the tag messes up. Mirage dodge+ distortion are godly survival tools, since the dodge gives protection, regen, removes a boon, and is also a stunbreak. 
---
This shall be the new gem skin :P
---
That's what the automod does. Certain words / phrases kick the bot into action, it closes the post with a message along the lines of "Small questions like this are best suited for the Q&amp;A" only a little wordier :) 
---
Nobody cares about lore when your team wipes on gorse ;) 
---
Holosmith with the sword is pretty noob-friendly yeah, and once you get more used to the rotation and tools, switching to Rifle brings *even more* CC. Another power class you can't go wrong with!
---
You mentioned season 2 and 3, is living world season one part of something else? 
---
then imo it should be refined to trigger more often so it matches what the general community considers should be in the Q&amp;A
---
Scourge with offhand warhorn (minor dps loss) brings three *quick* hard CC buttons with Torch 5, Warhorn 4, and Flesh Golem's charge. Flesh Golem and Scepter 2 deal constant slow CC. Garish Pillar's fear is also a nice CC bump.
---
Remember that this is a recommendation for a *newbie in raids*, not someone joining a meta group. For all the "well ideally the bars will break before fear gets to tick" or "well popping bane signet and hunter's verdict is gonna hurt your DPS and the bar will break anyway" that you can say about experienced groups, these are *absolutely not true* facts for raids where 1/2 of the players are beginners.
---
If one Entangle is not enough, the dps sucks, not the druid.
---
I don't think anyone's attacked you or been hostile, cruel, or insulting yet. The worst comment made on your post so far is [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/baknbi/only_very_rarely_do_post_titles_make_it_past_the/ekcarfw/), which is just a little condescending.
---
Changing the title wouldn't fix your post. The idea is impossible and probably wouldn't be implemented even if it was possible due to usability and consistency concerns and aims to solve an already-solved problem. But if you come up with a new idea, just call the post "Idea for increasing visibility of questions from players on the subreddit", "Idea for helping question posts be seen", or something. However, the title part was just a nitpick. Community moderators have all thought about it very hard. Due to the limitations of what moderators can do, there are only a few possible options for solving this problem, and some of them are already in place here.
---
If up and downvotes mean that much to you I can sell you my account. Just stop posting this non sense...
---
By that logic, half of the playerbase should quit the game cause they are not as rich or simply cant spend real money in this game, therefore the coolest skins are unavailable to them, therefore they quite cause they can't achieve it. 
---
By that logic, your solution doesn't work too. What if I don't have time to play the game to farm the gold to get all the possible rewards? Then I should quit as well. 
---
So ultimately, the game would have no players. Why can't I buy raid leggy armor with gold? I suck at mechanics so I cant play raids .. why cant I buy WvW leggy armor with gold? I suck at pvp and have no time to grind ranks .. why can't I buy legendary trinkets and gen 2 legendary weapons? I suck/dislike playing open world content... 
---
That's dedication.
---
Ye but people gonna hate on druid anyway. It was just an example tho, you just kinda want that extra immob as a druid. 
---
&gt;Weaver, Rifle Holo (sword has less CC on demand than DGH), Power Chrono, Shatter Mirage
---
I'm not going to recommend a class with a rotation like that to a newbie raider. It's enough of a learning curve to learn the boss mechanics without learning how to properly interrupt a complex rotation like Weaver's.

Also, in what world does Mirage bring more CC than Dragonhunter on demand? They've got F3, pistol 5, torch 5, and their DPS signets (similar to DGH's bane signet) unless you're making them drop Jaunt for Moa. Dragonhunter *without changing the build at all* has Binding Blade pull, Hunter's Verdict, Bane Signet, Dragon's Maw, and slow CC from the slow condition applied by its traps as well as the immobilize from Scepter 3.

:D

I always enjoy these posts, simply because I find it amusing/interesting to see which map OP finished last.
---
Season 1 was an experiment by Arenanet to tell a story in real time mostly in the open world. It's where the term "Living" came from.
---
Stories happened, and then once they were over they were gone. Naturally, while some people do remember it fondly, the vast majority of players hated this and Arenanet dropped it.l from Season 2 onwards.
---
There is a recap in game. I'd hesitate to call it good, but it's... serviceable. It covers what you need to know.
---
For the gameplay perspective, honestly it kind of sucked. 
---
Of the 25 separate Releases, maybe 6 were any good, and most of the good stuff is still in game as Fractals (The dungeons), Festivals (Queens Pavillion, Bazaar of the Four Winds, Super Adventure Box part 2, Dragon Bash got turned into Lunar New Year), or just straight up left in the game (Tequatl upgrade, Triple Trouble World Boss, Twilight Arbor Explorable Path 3)

the first 4 or 5 replies to your OP were quite on topic, mostly mentioning that a sticky for Q&amp;A exists already. Then you started complaining about being downvoted in nearly every comment you made. 
---
If you want to have a productive discussion, do your research first and learn to moderate your own discussions.
---
theres an upvote [+1] next to your name but I cannot remember where it was from, this is just funny though
---
This is pretty normal. I've been top 250 NA as Necro twice at this point (albeit in the ancient past lost to the Mists), but my next best class (Engineer) is high gold only, and everything else is lower than that. There's a lot to be said for being a one trick pony (albeit playing every PVP viable build for your main class depending on group composition and meta / balance at the time)
---
&gt;it just seems like alot of players aren't keen on using it, either because they dont really recognize it yet as a place they can expect to find answers, or feel that they might get more answers in its own post. Like, is there any way to make the sticked post a custom size on the posts list? like double thickness so it really stands out on top of being green. 
---
is the first responde i made, to a post that had already been downvoted below 20 BEFORE it got any responses. then that comment got downvoted to -6. it just doesnt end
---
Wow, thank you for the quick response!
---
I installed the redistributable you linked, went ahead and restarted, but unfortunately it did not help.  Also I checked every subdirectory inside the d912pxy directory but I didn't see any log.txt or crash.txt, unfortunately.  I don't know if this helps but the behavior I see is: 1) I open GW2 launcher like normal 2) launcher shows "downloading" screen as it tries to patch itself 3) launcher crashes and disappears before ever reaching the "initializing" step
---
I can PM more specific hardware etc. info if that would be helpful.
---
You don't need to be rich, especially irl rich, to acquire various things here. 
---
You need time in the first place to even play the game. So if you can't invest time, then you are out of discussion here.
---
And usually you can invest time in various ways to obtain same thing. Usually, but not here. They force player to go certain way, the way that is impossible for me.
---
There are some bugs in the tp. If you click to fast you can sell stuff below highest buy order. Happened to me 10 of those things you you salvage from gear. Charm of Brilliance or whatever the name is.

I started this game 2 months ago with a friend of mine, and last week we both hit max level. We are duoing some fractals for the fun of it, but something seems off : my friend keeps dying outside of his minion master reaper build.
---
It may be my fault : when we started, I heard that necromancer was quite easy to level up thank to pets. My friend having a pretty chaotic connection + not being that great at video games in general + liking pets in general, I overhyped him reaper. He's quite happy with it so it's a win I guess. BUT as I said, outside of his minion master build, he cannot survive. Hell, he finds even this build "squishy as fuck". And well, he never bothered to go in melee range, he prefered range.
---
So, should he stick with his minion master reaper build ? Can he do just fine with it in fractal ? Should he learn a new build ? Tbh I don't even know if he wants to learn anything other than this build. But if it's a dead end for higher fractals and raiding, he may change his ways. What do you think ?
---
Nice to hear! I personally don't have any experiences with the support team, but my gf told me she once bought the wrong item off the gem store, and when she contacted anet, they gave her back the gems AND let her keep the accidental item. they can be angels
---
Cripple is irrelevant as you're almost guaranteed to have it on the boss even on very new groups.
---
Warhorn isn't that minor a DPS loss - you cannot switch to it off cooldown, and this limits the effect of your sigil of torment. Torch 5 is part of your rotation, so is a (minor) dps loss to use for CC. Taking Flesh Golem instead of plaguelands is a moderate DPS loss. Similarly Fear is either used as part of the rotation (if you're a solo scourge) or will have its use limited by stacking with other sources of fear.
---
The classes have some CC options for sure, but even if you use all of them (taking a fairly serious DPS hit on a low-DPS class), it's still only an average amount so definitely can't be called "tons".
---
Oh? You’re approaching me?
---
I managed to get out of the tpose by sitting on a chair novelty and then dismounting. Not sure if that works in every case though.
---
I don't know why but that is adorable lol
---
Returning, low-mid level PvE player. A few questions:
---
1. HP trains (&amp; similar) have been my favorite kinds of activities since returning. However, I seem to usually be late to them, specifically HoT ones from VB onward. They seem to start at VB Daytime (?) but they're not guaranteed ofc. Are times coordinated somewhere or do they just happen when those leading players feel like it? And do they happen in PoF? (I saw the monthly one posted here already.)
---
2. What are the main uses for Karma? Have a lot, but idk what to do with it.
---
3. Aside from Gold/Gems, Karma, and Laurels, what other currencies should I be wary of (that aren't just for skins)?
---
dont retire it or you will loose profit
---
That is something only a PvE player would write. 
---
And also i mean i can say the same about PvE. Fractals player want the game mode to be improved but as long as litterally nothing changes. Same with raids. 
---
If you look at it from the perspective of those who carry the game mode, there are always things they want. In PvE it happens that they do. In WvW we get things we don't want and not those that we asked for over the years. 
---
So think about that before you try to make fun out of WvW.
---
Oh how lovely, I love self inflicted pain. 
---
DH has 300 defiance bar damage available at minimal loss to their DPS (from Dragon's Maw and Binding Blades). Mirage has 700 only from F3, Pistol 5 and torch 5. Their DPS signet is the same as bane signet so will always be ahead and it does have the extreme option to bring Signet of Humility if CC is really lacking. 
---
So it really doesn't bring all that much CC, and at least based on my experience DH is NOT an easy class for new players to play - I've helped train and command a few raid groups over varying skill levels, and DH is absolutely the class that I most try to push people away from. Players who have really struggled with their damage on dragonhunter have very quickly been near the top of the group once they start playing sword holo, daredevil or condi soulbeast.

Bug Chunkus.
