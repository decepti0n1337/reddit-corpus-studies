Divinity's reach location  mentioned in the book in sewers would be  really neat.

Good idea , I believe such things should be implemented by arenanet , overall the overflow system needs to be polished more , because sometimes the spam join a full map gets frustrating for many!
---
Yeah, bloodlust wasn't working for me in WvW either.  Wasn't getting any stacks until I reapplied it.
---
I assume this is your picture since reverse search turned no results, but I got suggested a cute comic [about Diana](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/303/083/a5e.jpg) by Google as the closest match, so that's a win-win :D

That’s the Orrian’s problem.  Ascalon first!

Dude if I was asleep and someone poked me real hard, I’d wake up.

You can check the wiki for each outfit and it will typically say when the last time it was on sale. If it was a BLTC exclusive drop then it will eventually be sold for statuettes, not sure how often those get rotated out.
---
I want a lighter emote I can hold up
---
Yes, tutorials would be great but the initial exoduses from PvP didn’t stem from lack of tutorials. It was Anets lack of upkeep and maintenance of their own mode.
---
They put all their eggs in one basket with the attempted esports scene and when that failed they pretty much jumped ship. 
---
There was a lot of constructive feedback from the playerbase practically begging for Anet to support the mode more because they saw the potential but it never happened.
---
This is the truth... the concert amuses me like nothing else has done in this game for a long damn time. It's just so... Spinal Tap-ish
---
Yes, but on the rare occasion that there are multiple on the same IP, use the same number shorthand for the IP followed by the port number. To my knowledge IP:Port combo *must* be unique. So instead of 2 different "Rata 123" listings, you get "Rata 123:456" and "Rata 123:789"

Any good Elematalist builds for Hearth of Thorns Hero points? (keep getting destroyed hard)
---
Trying to level the Tempest Ele but hot is tricky when I have to solo the bosses sometimes
---
Ah I see, thank you for explaining that, I thought power/condi damage &gt; condi duration, seems I was wrong about that.
---
Thx for enlightening me! :)
---
I see. I will keep that in mind! Thanks!
---
Thanks! I'm very familiar with the tower but it didn't cross my mind once, although I can see some elements that could have been inspired by it.
---
they have r/comissions in recent subs so they might do comissions. I like the style too.
---
The problem isn't your gear. It's your gameplay. People here are recommending that you spend tons of time revamping your gear, but when you finish, you'll find that nothing has changed. 
---
You need to be active when you play this game. Everyone that struggles has one thing in common: they play passively, standing still while clicking abilities with their mouse, and taking too much damage as a result. 
---
You have to play this game like an action or fighting game. You have to move out of the way of danger. You have to circle behind your enemy as they attack, so that their attack hits the empty space where you used to be moments ago. You have to recognize heavy, dangerous attacks, and dodge them.
---
You have to keep your eyes on your enemy and never on your skillbar, so that you can see the fight and react to it. To this end, you must not click your abilities with your mouse, which would require you to move your eyes and lose sight of danger. You need to use only keyboard shortcuts to use your skills, and use your mouse instead to turn your camera to keep your eyes on your foes.
---
Lol, you're right-- I slapped one of the more funkier creature designs I've done in there. Forgot to mention that while my style is primarily goofy/cartoony I can do a slightly more serious/"creepy" one for some monsters or dragons for example; that's one of 'em
---
Thanks, I used Sketchup and just a tad of Photoshop.
---
Ah good, was waiting for the September Monthly Automated Monthly Automated Tournament Excuse
---
For easy and safe gold farm - do an elder wood gathering run. You can find these trees all over Mount Maelstrom, Timberline Falls, Malchor's Leap, and all over the Orrian map. Doing that in all those maps will give you at least 2 to 3 stacks of elder wood logs. They sell pretty good in TP. 
---
For playing as warrior.
---
Indeed berserker stat is very good *but* you have to correctly time your dodges. I also got frustrated with playing warrior before. It would be nice to see how you did your build - like which traits you've slotted. For my warrior, I have berserker elite spec for PVE. The reason for this is I feel the Spellbreaker elite spec to be clumsy in PVE (player's view, might not be true for everyone else). I use axe main-hand and axe off-hand as primary weapons because Axe warrior is strong these days. And my secondary weapon is a Rifle - it's kinda weak, single target weapon however it's a nice option for the 'oh shit I used all my dodges!' moments. Most of the time I'm just spamming axe. You mentioned you're using GS - I suggest you change it to axes. It's stronger and you should be able to kill monsters before they could harm you.
---
But you aren't an elder dragon with power to match a god.
---
&gt; I likely won't make multiple sets as I was planning before while this exists.
---
Well good news is you really don't have to, being that you can right click and remove these from any piece of gear freely.  Even exotics.  And put them on a different character whether it's through your bank or shared inventory.
---
pls stop it with the reddit reaper circlejerk meme
---
reaper is not a good solo class! it's great vs groups of trash mobs with spin to win sure..it has literally no defensive cooldowns and shroud can only deal with chip damage not big boss hits
---
you clearly never actually solod stuff on necro/ranger..and i don't mean going shroud 4 into a group of moas in queensdale going all "wow so stronk" or full signet bearbow pewpewing from 1500 range
---
how many reaper lupi solos are out there again? like 2 with a condi build from 2014 that's it! why? cuz it's a freaking garbage solo class
---
you also very conveniently forget the fact that those dreadful mobs, the bane of mesmer's existence, frequently aggro on your illusions meaning you can run in a circle spamming shit 99% of the time
---
nice of you to ignore well of calamity and defender, again!
---
why do you bring up fractals even? also in the groups you "never see people looking for chrono", do you see them looking for reapers? holosmiths maybe? freaking deadeyes or daredevils? jeez
---
what's your argument even? pve should be balanced around killing open world trash mobs? just go gs mirage and spam dodge and 1 with mantra of pain and defender or something
---
i never ever said it's fine what anet did to chrono, making it unfun! did you even read my final line? i remember old blurred frenzy instead of the current mess, i remember 0 clone shatters that allowed double mass invisiblity etc.
---
objectively and realistically speaking though? mesmer is in a great place
---
29 per day iirc.. it really doesn't.
---
I didn’t even realize I wanted this until now. Bring on a frost skeleton dragon for Halloween!
---
&gt;  because it takes forever to get the provisioner's tokens for a full set.
---
10 days for full rune set.

U can always apply to edit the wiki also.

That's what the enchanted bow, the one with magic powerful enough to crack his tooth, is for.  ;)
---
Pokey poke!  Wake up Jormag!  I've come to bargain!
---
Maining Chrono and Scourge here... I'm so glad I made Quickbrand just in case (I'll probably stay on Chrono anyway).

Pugs, yes. Statics, no.

Know the difference.

Holy butts, it’s a comic about meeting ME. You did a good job with my Charr!
---
I love how disaffected I seem in this comic :P I see you didn’t draw the part where I repeatedly failed the jumping puzzle. Or the part where we all RIGHTEOUSLY SLAYED THE BOSS.

Was nice meeting you! It’s always nice meeting people. Makes me really happy people are enjoying the content.

Sure. People tend to lie about things that make them look better. Most people aren't going to lie about their rating being LOWER. So they are likely to be lying about being in Gold when they are in Silver, if even at all.
---
That said, none of this matters. GW2 PvP devs have already confirmed GW2 PvP has a low population, which causes these imbalances in matchmaking rating. It isn't that surprising that Legends or high end Plat's end up in gold rating games. There aren't enough PvPers to go around.
---
To address your original point. No, being in a game with someone doesn't mean you have similar rating. It SHOULD mean that, but the PvP population is WAY too LOW for it to mean that in reality.
---
Ah I still have their discord.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I would pop in from time to time to tell Bob to STFU but he's never there anymore it seems.....
---
I was merely referring to just the timegate part.  The time it takes someone else to gather the other materials isn't really a timegate.  That's just at their own pace.
---
I did Tangled Depths with her once! Once people found out what she worked on, map chat just turned into people complimenting her and gushing about Exordium, it was so wholesome
---
 [They aren't even trying :\^)](https://playeternalmagic.com/images/media/screens/24.jpg)
---
She designed many of the best weapon skins ingame. just looked her up and she even designed the spirit weapons. Aether is still one of my all-time favourite shortbow. I wasn't that interested in the gen2 legy dagger and shield, but hey, tastes differentiate. Crafted shining blade instead ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I was under the impression that Jormag isn't yet corrupting Bangar, but Drakkar is instead. Drakkar is the one that turned Svanir and we see giant footprints on the roof of the blood keep near Bangar's office. So I think Drakkar is selecting a new warrior serve Jormag and wake him.
---
The amount of "skill compression," -- the "value" you get out of Firebrand F2 &amp; F3 is whack.  In their current iteration and alongside the utility library that Guardian has Chrono &amp; Druid are not playing the same game.  Their condition cleanse capabilities are inferior and their access to stability was pretty much zeroed out.  Their competitive value proposition relative to playing the meta Firebrigade compositions ... leaves much to be desired.  There are of course things that Chrono can do via blink and portal, but Guardian/FB and Renegade have similarly deep flexibility options.
---
Just don't forget that it scratches at the level 6 with a deeper groove at the level 7.
---
He used to post weaver montages and gameplay too. Then he did a giveaway... 
---
Guess he figured out people like to gamble their money on dubious five giveaways more than watch him play PvP/WvW.
---
Thief: Doesn't feel good does it!
---
I ran into 3 that I can remember gaile grey in LA near the toilet, then an anet employee playing thief in pvp, and one was trailing after an enemy zerg and got picked off by my group. 
---
Any time I used to see one I annoyed them politely.
---
But gw2 is boring af now. Dropped off after pof.
---
I mean the facts are in this thread, but I suppose I can repeat them.
---
"Ebonhawke? Ascalon Settlement? Rurikton? Fields of Ruin? Separatists? Logan Thackeray?"
---
Certainly more Ascalonians left in the game than just ghosts. Even as a player character, you can choose to identify as a Human Ascalonian.
---
Also, regarding the Foefire, this was a single act committed by a king that was pushed to madness by the savagery of the Charr. I'm not sure how this can be viewed as the general sentiment of the people. Just because not all Ascalonians left with Rurik doesn't mean that they consented to being a part of the Foefire. Many stayed because it was their home and they'd had ties to the land for over a thousand years.
---
F.cking hell I must have missed a ton of gold by salvaging them directly all this time. Thanks for the info.
---
Why was the Druid nerfed? It sucked.
---
Scourge is fine.  You're just a melee class now.
---
IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU TOO.
---
:'D I got squished by the boulder but didn't get downed. Just added the revive symbol for effect.
---
Also I failed on the jump to the first chest in the JP and pretty much just waited for the beacon to be activated. There's only so much I could fit in 4 panels .\_.
---
I'm hoping the Olmakhan will be included going forward with the Saga. ONE CHARR!!
---
I’m imagining a Cthulhu dreaming in R’lyeh sort of situation, whispers subconsciously influencing Bangar’s thinking, facilitating his journey further North by having its minions in the shadows ensuring the march is undisturbed. In some ways perhaps like how Arthas was lured to Frostmourne in Northrend.
---
everyone ive talked to after these games has this issue
---
The art has the symbol for the Druid, not the Soulbeast.
---
If we’re sharing dev stories, I have to give a shoutout to Irenio. Raided with him a few times and he’s genuinely just a nice, chill guy. He asked us all about a recent balance patch and seemed to really care about and respond to what people were saying about it. 10/10, would Necro with him again.
---
I think that you might have misread my comment.
---
Thanks! Before I took a break from gw2 I'd actually been trying to draw some comics inspired by my experience. Maybe now that I'm back, I'll pick that back up again :)
---
No, I read it, I am merely stating that the artwork has the symbol for the Druid, not the Soulbeast, which was what my original comment was about.
---
Unfortunately, it's 200 Gems per episode.
---
Wow, let's admit it's meta, while trying to pretend it's not meta. Keep whining...it'll get you far.
---
I *did* say that it is another one of those things you'd need actual numbers from Anet for.   You cannot dismiss your lack of data with more lack of data.  It was to show that anecdotal evidence is anecdotal; saying how often people do or don't do the temple event is anecdotal.
---
Don't tell me you don't care when you took all this time and effort respond yet again.  LOL.  Disingenuous again.
---
"Most people will have some shards."  THANK YOU!  That is not what you said originally so thank you for changing your argument because the original one was wrong.  Most people will have some amount that falls in the middle of the bell curve, as I illustrated and have been consistent about.
---
kiss kiss💛
---
NA seems to have it figured out but not EU. Sadly yes, Anet hasnt done anything and they should as you said. Its a great thing quality wise, map queues also for when maps are full.
---
I thought that I was actually mistaken and opened the chest after reset but then I remembered that I've started doing fractals **before** reset and got the login reward inside fractals. Then I did jump into grothmar directly and did meta events, took all the keys and went to vault. Somebody was opened the door already (which doesn't matter usually cause chest always ask for all the keys) but it was already open.
---
I tried again while writing this tho and chest was available for claim so I'm deleting the thread rn. It looks like some strange bug occured.
---
Yeah I don't care at all about raiding really, just wanted something that might work for both fb and dh and be useful in wvw while able to mindlessly farm in open world.
---
Here is a fun fact:
---
There were many more guilds doing GvG before bloodlust than after. Before you had 3 or more guilds per SERVER who did GvG. Afterwards you had every GvG guild have to relocate to like 3 different servers to continue the scene. You still had some in other servers but they weren't contenders like AGG, NS, EP, etc. 
---
So while you say the golden age happened after bloodlust I contest that and say it was right before bloodlust since you had SIGNIFICANTLY more guilds involved in the scene along with a 3rd party website tracking it. You also had GvG Showdown a youtube show done by Ogre that highlighted all the matches you missed.
---
I'm sorry but that is the golden age of GvG in my book. Afterwards you had guilds that weren't the best becoming the best. Same as the HoT fiasco that GvG went through. 
---
Easy to become the best when all the competition quits. Not trying to be harsh but it's the truth.
---
Whatever fractal he was talking about... He was right ;o
---
Ok that helps solve it then. It's probably just a client-side bug wherein your client thinks that the chest is unavailable. Changing maps or relogging fixes it, it sounds like.
---
You'd be surprised how much they are around. Just hidden sometimes to have some fun chilling, I can totally understand that.
---
They sell full season packs
---
I'd recommend getting them, but I mostly play for the story
---
They Do, but it's not 200 gems.
---
Ya true. Sorry didn't realize that's what I meant.
---
boop
---
Snoot
---
honestly i can't bother with this and 99% eu open world comms won't, like they didn't care about sorting proper parties in squad for meta events for everything to go smoother. people in open world don't care for anything especially in TD and AB, i even stopped tagging up and now just leech those meta events because that's true open world endgame. i'll pop my tag when i need something because it drives casuals to you like flies to shit
---
yeah i average around 300 ping so that is probably a factor
---
I love your art style :O
---
nice ❤️
---
Last time I saw a dev was in wvw. He was alone. I killed him :)
---
Jormag is still under ice as of post-S4 Dragon Bash.
---
It's possible that nothing's corrupting Bangar, too. We see a Wandering Traveler shouting the same things as Suspicious Travelers outside Blood Keep. It could be Bangar made an alliance with the Sons of Svanir, and have avoided direct influence as of yet.
---
I guess I've been maintaining a weird headcanon of all my characters and just living out their stories when I play. Aside from that I want to play the game through once as each profession and race and there is a ton of replayability in that. Sure the meat of the gameplay is the same but certain classes have an easier time on certain missions and the dialogue is different. I like seeing how ANet eatablishes these differences in the way characters interact with you based on race.
---
My first character is a human female deadeye so I run through every new piece of content on her first. I loved Bound by Blood. I wanted to hate it but I loved it. That concert is the most fun I've had playing the game. I have a female charr warrior (blood legion even) so I ran through it with her too and the subtle differences between each characters interactions with you is what I love about the game. Sure it's nothing crazy (they still have to follow a rigid storyline) but I appreciate it. (Not really a fan of the new charr female VA tho)
---
All kinds of minor enemy factions started allying together. Flame Legion and Dredge allied up and made the Molten Alliance and started fucking shit up. Nightmare Court and the Krait allied to form the Toxic Alliance and started fucking shit up. Inquest and Atherblade allied up but never got a cool name, but started fucking shit up.
---
Queen Jennah decided to throw a big party to celebrate humanity overcoming its enemies. She got tons and tons of cool robots and cloaked them in mesmer illusions and had you fight them for fun like Westworld. Then some Sylvari engineer named Scarlet showed up and took control of them and stole their cool robot tech. Scarlet revealed herself to be behind all the new enemy alliances.
---
Scarlet then unleashed a giant killer robot as a test. It was ridiculously OP but the players killed it. Finally, Scarlet brought all of her plans together and attacked Lion's Arch with all the different alliances and a bunch of robots. At the final hour, she brought in some crazy flying saucer airship with a huge drill poking out of the bottom, and started drilling into the LA harbor.
---
You managed to stop the assault and boarded the flying saucer, thinking that big drill was weird but probably not that big of a deal. You killed Scarlet but it was too late. The drill finally poked all the way through Tyria's crust into a buried leyline and disrupted it. Elsewhere in the Maguuma Jungle, Mordremoth got woken up because apparently that was the main leyline he was eating while asleep, and its disruption gave him some serious midnight munchies. You realized that Scarlet was corrupted by Mordremoth the whole time, and the entire thing was a massive plot just to drill into that leyline and wake up Mordremoth.
---
You've got it backwards. Taimi's Machine didn't wake Jormag - Jormag was already fully awake long before Taimi's Machine, by 150 years (Primordus was awake for 200 years). Balthazar using the device put Jormag and Primordus into a state similar to Kralkatorrik's crystal cocoon at the end of the Dragonfall meta ("sleeping").
---
If anything it is a buff to Scg in WvW my dude.  Good thing they are at least nerfing damage as well or it'd be a complete joke.
---
You spam "correct" people, but got the situation entirely backwards. Taimi's Machine is what put Jormag to "sleep", not woke it up.
---
True, that depends on the time you do it on. I usually do it after evening Tequatl and it's a oneshot. Other times it may take a bit longer than that due to having more than one running phase.
---
Yes, but those new nerfs were what—five months ago?
---
Charr suck, should be abandoned and the humans should take back tetris Tyria. Period. Everything else has nothing to do with a real Guild Wars.

&gt;You're right...

&gt;  
---
&gt;Chrono's not meta in anything. The're never in any static group, neither are druids, nor scourges...especially in encounters like...say...SH. Nope! Never!  
---
&gt;None of those are meta classes for anything. You got me.  
---
&gt;Perhaps if you (and others who are just as special) pressed the downvote button a little harder, you'd be even more correct. Try it!
---
Okay kiddo. Sit down and let's set the facts straight first, before we get into your anecdotal stories.
---
1). Nowhere did I state that chronos aren't used ever. **Nowhere**. Just because I said that they're not meta **doesn't mean that they're nonexistent now.** I'm well aware that statics still use them, because my old static still does. *But*, they're working on phasing out the old support duo because *they know that there are better options now.*
---
2). Just because you see still see them being used by other people doesn't automatically make them meta in your eyes. If you actually used your brain you'd realize that. 
---
Not sure why you'd delete your comments. If you're that confident in what you say and are arrogant enough to say it, why delete? It's not like what you say will be any less stupid.
---
&gt;vP and WvW tracks reset to 0 for me this morning after daily rese
---
Same here
---
This brings back memories of back when I used to play with a Dev. When the game was first released I hung out sometimes with Chris Whiteside in Darkhaven.
---
Dude was super cool and super chill. I remember vividly that I was upset about them changing the Guardian Greatsword skills around. Back then your 2 skill was on 4 and your 4 skill was on 2. By todays standards a really mild complaint but he assured me he would talk it over with the team about making the decision to change a skill button rotation for a weapon 2-3 months into the game. Since that day I cannot recall them ever doing that again but I could be mistaken.
---
I miss you Chris! T___T
---
I was farming lab last year with shortbow daredevil, using Unhindered Combatant for long dodge, sigil of stamina and sigil of speed. Shortbow is fast, one shot tags up to 3 mobs, and due to sigils you have infinite swiftness and endurance. This build is very mobile and good for tagging, works best for me.
---
Then there is firebrand build with tome 1 spam. Each time you kill an enemy - tome CD refreshes due to Renewed Justice trait in Radiance spec. Some people saying it feels almost like old staff, but i personally didn't like it that much.
---
Third build i know is flamethrower engineer. Super simple — you just burn things. Haven't tried it.
---
Most likely there are more builds i'm not aware of. Never looked for more, because i already found the best build for me, which is daredevil.
---
I only assume that Bangar is being corrupted because that is kind of Jormag's thing, and Jormag's power is clearly being used to assist Bangar. After all, Cre makes it very clear that "this storm isn't normal" since it's "stopping us from following Bangar" and we have no idea what created the ice construct.
---
It's so cute. I want this to be an animated series on YouTube that I don't watch for years but then binge all at once.
---
Last time I saw a Dev I hunted them down viscously in WvW to get my achieves.

GW1 required first and last names. You couldn't reserve single word names. But the point you made still stands. When they announced that GW1 names would be reserved, people just bought character slots or renames to lock the names they would want for GW2 that could be popular/taken.

Russian community is big. All of us want to write in chat with native language. Hard to many players to talk with transliteration. It will be a good gift from Anet to give opportunity to all russian players to communicate via russian letters.
---
Hello. 
---
I live in Russia and play this wonderful game.  I would really like ALL people in her to be equal.  We do not require a full-fledged Russian translation of the game, but we are asking for at least the ability to communicate within the game in our native language.  I hope that the developers will hear us and give us a clear answer.
---
Thank you all and good luck.
---
The comic says back after a long break tho
---
It was a different way to communicate features - not a failure to do so.

Your original comment says nothing about soulbeast though?

Really depends on your mouse imo, but here are mine. Warning, these have built up over 7 years of playing, and the logic on some is built around rarely using or explicitly being unable to accidentally trigger them. Also, I only have 2 side buttons on my mouse, because fancy ones have broken over the years and I keep reverting to the one that refuses to ever break:
---
123QE for weapon skills. 
---
Mouse 1/2 for Utility 1/2, Alt 2 for Utility 3 (since it is usually a never cast or rarely cast). 
---
Alt 1 Heal Skill, Alt ` for Elite
---
Alt Q for "Shroud" Ability, Alt E/M1/M2/W for Shade Skills. (Alt W is fine in combat, but can be annoying in the world if you need to highlight NPC's and forget).
---
C for Special Action.
---
Russian-language chat will be bon for the new russian or russian-language players!

In most games I took the less bandwagony and super strong characters. When I started gw2 I thought chrono would be evergreen and put a lot of effort into making one. When it got nerfed every month after I got the full fractal gear and just did some raids, I just stopped playing.

I love GW2, I hope [Arena.net](https://Arena.net) will meet the Russian community of the game and will introduce the Cyrillic alphabet in the game.
---
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurraaaaaahhhhh
---
I really hope that the Anet will pay attention to this appeal.  
---
This is very important, not only for the Russian-speaking community but also for everyone who faces a similar problem, not only in guild wars 2
---
Please start supporting Cyrillic letters!
---
I'm russian and I've been playing Guild wars 2 for over 6 years. Communicating with friends and guildies was always an awkward thing because of lack of cyrillic. It's something you can never get used to. Please make our life easier, it's already hard enough lol
---
Thank you very much for that. Its really important.
---
hope so :)
---
We love GW2, we support GW2. Can we ask for ANet to support us, Russian speakers?
---
Hope will never die. Thank you for support :)
---
its like you ignored the gray text after the skill description
---
i've actually been thinking the same thing as you in terms of hammer. it seems though that mace/mace has good quality of life stuff. i've done w7 qadim and it's actually a big deal that mace 5 is ranged, so that you can safely CC anomalies when they step into the lava, whereas with hammer you'd have to step into the lava yourself and consequently die. i have both hammer and mace/mace on hand on my berserker.
---
WoodenPotatoes best the personal story without using skills aside from a couple of times the game hard forces you to interact with bundles and sieges.
---
Super late but OP is using Duelist Pants.
---
I am from Russia too. I hope we're going to get some good response from A-net
---
Chinese developer. Nothing will be done about this :)
---
I love GW2! Please enter the cyrillic into the game!
---
 Please start supporting Cyrillic letters!
---
Excellent video, I completely agree with all the arguments set forth in it. If Russian localization appeared in GW2, it would be great. If even Cyrillic appeared, that would be good too:)

1-5, F1-F5 (Dont really play scourge so nit much help here), and then q for heal, shift +q for ability 1, z for ability 2, e for ability 3, and shift+e for ulti.
---
Spanish support is already pretty much garbage (old google translate levels) and with no voice acting, so yeah, new languages are pretty much a big nope.
---
No idea about French or German, but I haven't heard good things either.
---
ArenaNet made a big mistake by not making more language-based servers, even if those languages weren't supported by the game.
---
Take a Gw 2 Break
---
im sure she didnt mind and was probably something that she had in the back of her mind as she was going in to it. 
---
she loved to hang out :)
---
i miss her as CRM. :( thankfully she still plays tho
---
No one asks for a full Russian translation.  And to introduce the Cyrillic alphabet into the game is not difficult, especially since it is partially present there.
---
Here's the thing.   
---
I can’t get why Arena.Net cannot add cyrillic (which is enabled in the shop btw) and allow the custom translation add-on (0$ effort). This is not a lot of work, but interest from the Russian-speaking population will raise. And they'll get a profit from it.    
---
From my perspective, it looks like they don’t like us so much that even profit growth will not change things.   
---
If I don't understand something, please correct me.  
---
Peace.
---
Let's get a propper strike mission first.
---
I'd say PoF is worth it for the mounts alone! As for waiting for a sale, maybe just play around to see if you want the mounts now or not?
---
It’s terrible when you can’t write in a language you understand while chatting with people who, like you, speak the same language. I am not from Russia, but I speak Russian. And yes my English is terrible. lol
---
Good idea, I support.
---
Нopefully, ArenaNet will give us the opportunity to use Cyrillic characters in the game chat.
---
Holy shit did you drew this on Revit?
---
Plus, the only thing Trump can drop are decades off of America's hegemony.
---
I always do pugs so firebrand for me!
---
Agree. We need Cyrillic.
---
I'm pretty sure that would have happened with or without him
---
oh man, totally forgot that you needed first and last name in gw1... been so long already D:
---
*One mo*
---
That's what I usually tell myself, but I eventually end up forgetting about that tolerable threshold and just go yolo hoping for a jackpot or slowly getting back what I've lost and make a bit of profit. :&lt;
---
Next time you'll roll better. Keep on the winner's spirit!
---
Definitely not worth a specialization mechanic name at this point. Minor trait slot maybe? I have no idea why they decided to "fix" it anyway, none of the Scrapper overperforming issues since HoT ever had anything to do with FG.
---
That's exactly what I told myself before it went downhill :D
---
The most hilarious thing is that it seems thtat even the bootleg game has a guild vs guild game mode
---
This has been said but yes. If you start gambling with the mentality of "i'm gonna make big money" then you are in for a world of hurt. If you gamble always take that money as gone. Therefore if you win it will feel even better. And this works with all kinds of gambling in life.
---
I think we deserve  to have a possibility write to our friends on native language.
---
Guild Wars 2 is the best project among MMORPG games. And I glad to see the post about supporting Cyrillic letters in the game. ArenaNet, thanks for great work. Please, listen this author and us.
---
While the idea itself is fine, it might create potential issues. While Russian is still Russian even when written in latin letters it is easier for support to actually translate and understand if some sort of report comes in. If it is written in a completely different alphabet it would suddenly require people understanding that alphabet in order to handle the reports in the best possible way.
---
It is also the issue of precedence. If they do it for Cyrillic letters, they "have" to do it for Chinese, Devanagari and Arabic as well (just to mention the ones who are vastly bigger than Cyrillic)
---
&gt; All of us want to write in chat with native language.
---
Well, technically, no, not all. I do prefer to speak in chat in English since the whole game is in English and the world is in English — it's more immersive that way — and to communicate with the whole global, international community in an international language. The Russian community comes with a certain baggage, and lack of Cyrillic partially negates it - at least in the part where map chat doesn't get spammed with pretty much what the Internet would expect from Russian gamers.
---
&gt; Hard to many players to talk with transliteration.
---
But yes, this is true. Whispering to friends who do not speak enough English becomes awkward when you have to keep switching back and forth between two languages — or more, like, between a language and a weird monstrosity of transliteration. I do feel like sometimes people just go with not chatting because of this, even when they do have something good to say.
---
Producer: We need maps for our Guild War mode.
---
Dev: Guild Wars map? Got it!
---
or just wait a little bit and often u can join half way through the event and still get your rewards
---
You are right, I’ve been playing wow classic for the last few weeks and only login to get daily rewards, mainly due to the recent drama I encountered but yeah what you mentioned is a big reason too.
---
Honestly I wouldn't really mind this that much if they reverted some of the dmg nerfs of sword autos, but at this point they're just making thief clunkier to play instead of offering any real solution.
---
Other than stacking stealth which is the most boring playstyle in the game.
---
As was already pointed out in a different thread, they received said feedback and ignored it. Don't play dumb.
---
We need Cyrillic, Anet, please!
---
which one?
---
This. I never let myself go below 500g. I don't roll again until I've regained enough gold through other game play to do so.  
---
That said, I _have_ gone broke more than a few times despite having this rule for myself. I have more than everything I could possibly need gear/item-wise. There really isn't anything I actually need anymore so it isn't a huge deal to me if I lose everything sometimes. It sucks, but I also only really use gold for consumables anyway so it's not the end of the world.  
---
I've gambled a _lot._ I've won the 2k grand prize three times, the 1k prize ten times and the 500g too many times to count.
---
Supported from Belarus russianspeaking player!!!
---
gw2 literally supports some japanese symbols, various unique symbols (smiley faces, clouds, etc). You're mistaking localisation with fonts.
---
 I love GW2!  I hope ArenaNet will see this post !
---
I don't think he is awake is he? I guess he can still corrupt from his slumbering state, but I think this plan to get his own Dragon is to capture it somehow - although I think his idea and maybe some of the people on his side are being corrupted.
---
I know what you mean :(
---
(┛◉Д◉)┛彡┻━┻
---
No, letting Russians write in Cyrillic will kill the game with constant unintelligible spam in map chat.
---
I don't get it?
---
ye i see my fault  
---
now let's take in paralyzation
---
you kinda agreed allready that core with mace and para is better than core with hammer and para.  
---
By around 10 breakbar dmg i think.
---
let's ignore that for now since the only Boss you still play core is MAMA
---
Even tho Hammer is more Breakbar dmg on Berserker even with para (which you mentioned somewhere before) there is still a thing against it:  
---
If you play Berserker usualy Headbutt is enough, even if you would swap to offset to finish a cc that somehow did not break allready the cast time of hammer is almost doubled compared to maces if you need the extra cc.  
---
a lot of phases are to fast for even Hammer for coming up in Time again while Mace 3 is up at this point so for a 2nd Breakbar Maces would be more cc.  
---
&gt;I've been testing it in CMs+t4s and the aoe cc  and damage, and and the grouping up you can do with hammer 4 is insane.  I'm telling you, it really feels good having the extra cc and mobility  and damage.
---
CMs and T4 is a way different story since you can use consumables. Those are way better/faster cc than weapon swaping would ever be. The only time there you want to swap weaponsets is MAMA. And for MAMA you run in trouble with the cooldowns (which i mentioned before). It's that bad that you usualy would even run mace/shield just for the faster cooldowns.
---
if your group is that bad that you rly would lack 120 breakbardmg ye sure go for Hammer, but i think i've never seen that little bit of breakbar missing. Usualy noone ccs at all or it's a somewhat fast breakbar.
---
So as a non russian speaker, why is it that russians always use the ingame communication options, and why do you guys stick with russian?
---
I often play CSGO and it seems that even if players know eachother, they won't use discord but still just talk using the ingame chat.
---
And more often than not, if i encounter a fellow dutchmans, we still most likely stick to english. (whenever dutch people start talking dutch its mostly toxic, so i prefer to forget the fact that i'm dutch when that happens.)
---
I'm not really complaining, but with online gaming being so universal, i just can't wrap my head around the few communities sticking with their native language. It seems to me like thats the kind of thing that earns you a reputation. And its not a good 1 right now.
---
There are many nationalities.  Love alone.  It’s hard to love someone else’s, not your own.
---
Unfortunately the characters are encoded differently. This may be harder to implement than it seems. As a career, I support a software that people  always ask us to add russian to, specifically for our chat function and it would require our devs to rebuild the entire chat interface from scratch.
---
Druid is still meta in raids
---
Necro has been meta only for a moment, when epi was busted
---
Chrono is still meta for raids
---
There's chat language filter that removes everything but English but it doesn't work perfectly. 
---
Adding Cyrillic support in chat will isolate in long term playerbase on both sides - those who operate in Latin script won't be able to talk with those who use Cyrillic script and those who use Cyrillic won't talk with the rest because why bother with those who aren't using it. It's enough Germans and French pathologically behave on EU server like English doesn't exist. Besides, if anet didn't added support for this writing system in past 7 years it's unlikely it will do it now. Go train your latinization skills and learn bare minimum of communicative English instead, comrades.
---
I highly doubt wvw players asked for 10 target shades. No way.
---
Its in Reunion With The Pact
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reunion\_with\_the\_Pact](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reunion_with_the_Pact)
---
ctrl-F "The Charr are" to find it. I got it as a human which made the whole thing even more jarring. I didn't click on it cause of how insulting it was for the characters but now that I'm reading it Logan doesn't even defend Ascalon but just says "oh there was a lot of victims"
---
I mean Jesus Anet, at least try and remember the racial relations you created in the game and have your characters act like normal people. In real life if you told somebody that the people who committed genocide where the true victims they would rightfully flip on you.
---
Weird. I would imagine this being the case if it weren't UTF, but both accents and Chinese symbols do show already.
---
[Arena.Net](https://Arena.Net)[ is not friends with Russian players. And it really upsets me. And that keeps me from buying a game.](https://Arena.Net)
---
why dont add unicode support in chat interfaces from the ground up?
---
Cheeki breeki
---
If I swich my input to Ukrainian and type anything in chat field, I can Ctrl-A/Ctrl-C it, paste into another program and it pastes Ukrainian characters fine. So it seems like codepoints support is there, it's just that the font Anet has in the game doesn't have Cyrillic glyphs. For some reason. In 2019.
---
*laughs in guardian*
---
Username checks out.
---
western gw2 clients supports chinese letters and some other non ANSI characters...
---
&gt; So it is ego, then. As I stated in my initial comment. "I can't do it my way so I won't do it at all." Was that so hard to understand?
---
They do it, elsewhere. Was that so hard to understand? Why do you think there are so many external tools that replicate functions the wiki already has?
---
You can keep ignoring the problem and blaming ego. Meanwhile, the quality keeps declining and information keeps getting decentralized.
---
&gt;All of which can be corrected by others, much like bad information or grammatical errors. And, if not correctable, removed.
---
Good luck with that when there are no clear rules to dictate what is right or wrong.
---
&gt;I've contributed to over a dozen wikias over the course of ten years or more. And while I don't do it full time, I've done several hundred edits on a handful of separate wikias alone.
---
Every wiki is a world, and the experience on one has nothing to do with another. Also, 1,500 edits is a joke, no offense. You probably never entered a policy debate, but I'm not here to play a "game of egos" and see who's dick is longer.
---
Being stubborn about problems doesn't help fix them. What's your goal, a good resource, or a moral high-ground where you're right and everyone else is wrong? Again, the ego problems don't come from the side you think they're coming. That side is creating their own websites, with better guides and tools than your "collaborative cesspit" where there are no rules and no guidelines.
---
People are lazy and don't feel like putting effort into learning a new language just to communicate in the game. Plus the majority of Russian-speaking players only know English from their school&amp;college classes, and these are quite likely to leave students at the "Landan iz da kapital ov Greit Britn" level. 
---
As for not using discord - no idea.
---
I'm Ukrainian and I always use English in games - not just because it's more convenient. Years of playing on Russian game servers broke something in me, and every time I see Russian messages (and especially Russian game slang) in a completely English chat, it makes me instantly burn through my chair.
---
Honestly if its Gw2 with a better engine that runs good iam sold.
---
sad that Anet never invests in their engine... other MMO &amp; games clearly show its possible.
---
yeh but realistically filtering cyrillic chat is much much much easier than filtering different latin languages
---
&gt;10GB the game, 5GB the spywere
---
Only 5gb ? thats fine. windows takes like 22gb+ /s
---
Seriously any game / software / OS spys now on its users.
---
&gt; those who operate in Latin script won't be able to talk with those who use Cyrillic script 
---
nache tak ty mene rozumijesh.
---
Hi everyone, I am from Russia and really love GW2, I really want to communicate with my duzi in my native language, Thank you!
---
Yeah I do, even though I have lost big, I actually earned that 1.5k in the first place with gambles, rolled a 500, then a 1k. I've also won the 2k jackpot a few times. I estimate the odds of getting the 2k jackpot at 1 in 1000,  the odds for the 1k roll at about 1 in 100, and 1 in 50 for 500g, roughly.
---
I mean it's no sure thing, but one day, you may potentially earn back what you lost today by gambling. If you really can't stomach farming. But you may lose more before that day comes.
---
And whatever you do, NEVER buy gems with cash and turn it into gold to gamble with. Literally never do that.
---
And wateA
---
I think you are talking about the F3, Sand Cascade.
---
I'm talking about the F5, which has currently two effects : 
---
1) the necromancer gain a powerful shield
---
2) the pulsing damage around the Scourge and its shades
---
With the next patch, the pulsing AoE will be either on the Necromancer or the Shades, depending if a Shade is up, but what about the personnal barrier ? It realistically can't go on the Shades, since they aren't targetable, aren't able to take dmg, why would they gain the barrier ? 
---
Hence -&gt; If you have a shade up and press F5, I think the pulsing AoE would go around the shades BUT the personnal barrier still goes to the Necro
---
It doesn't seem like it. I wouldn't be surprised if there had been a mobile release in the works that was held off, and they copied off the assets in China.
---
So, can we get the Cantha district back once China does nothing about this release?
---
Already downloading and will try.

You do realize that you will try an Asian MMO that steal assets? XD
---
It will be shit, lol... Even if the engine will be probably be "better".
---
&gt;You do realize that you will try an Asian MMO that steal assets? XD
---
Its free i wont loose anything. and if they can make a gw2 that runs better iam all in.
---
after all iam a customer i dont care honestly.
---
&gt;It will be shit
---
I will see its at 40% right now.
---
&gt;Even if the engine will be probably be "better".
---
Ye it cant get much worse than Anets engine that they dont update / work on sadly. Gw2 with the treatment other games get would be fucking awesome.
---
I can read it but there's no grammatical sense behind it from my perspective
---
It's not spying if you agree to it before you install.
---
Seems a little bit racist tho. And hypocritically.   
---
Anet:   
---
"We wil translate the shop to them, not a single more word"  
---
"Oh they've made a petition, 40k followers, let's just ignore them. Stoopid russians."  
---
"Oh, one dude for 7 years promoted out product in Russia for free, nonono we're not going to answer to his messages at all".  
---
Think about it.
---
But it *is* fear. Sure, Aurene's entrance caught everyone off guard but Bangar believes that we, the Commander, ordered Aurene to show off. Vigil soldiers and even Gorrik were attacked to gather intelligence about Aurene and if she has a weakness.
---
Bangar wants to control Jormag to "even the odds". Because he fears us and Aurene. Because in his worldview, we could backstab and end the charr easily if leaders like him don't take measures to prevent that.
---
Just stop gambling.. really.
---
I’ve lost over 4k gold in a single night and i felt really bad for the next few days even considering uninstalling the game. For the next 3 months i would always gamble when i had the 100g and 250 ectos and everytime i did a little profit i could not stop from continuing gambling all the way till i went down to 0. I was also super depressed at times from the game because of the whole gamble thingy and i realized what’s the point at all? Even if i managed to restore my losings i still probably wont’t stop gambling because of the little gold you earn by farming per hour and making everything else you do for gold seems unrewarding. 8 Months clean from gambling i managed to craft my legendary armor, 3 legendary weapons and soon to finish my fourth and that’s from just playing the game (raids,fracs, hot metas and pvp). 
---
So yeah my advice would be do yourself a favor and just stop gambling , it’ll be hard at first but over time you’ll even wouldn’t want to gamble anymore.
---
GW2 doesn't support "some" Japanese... tbf it's more accurate to just say it supports Chinese.
---
Main problem is that the engine part can't be worked much on.
---
The engine is old and already pushed to it's limits, it could actually give even more, but unluckily the fact that the core of the engine is so old make it optimized for mainly using a single thread only...thus making many mid or low end PC fall down a lot in performance. They only thing they could work on is a native dx12 support, which someone already developed, but it works mainly  for said mid and low tier PC. High end ones gain very little. 
---
Thanks to that and the fact that it's just easier to wait for more powerful CPUs to come out/become affordable, it's just easier to play the waiting game instead of investing resources.
---
Everything after that would mean to change the core of the engine...aka rewriting it from scratch...aka it's easier/more profitable to make a new game...maybe we will see an engine revamp when the game gets to  like...10-12 yo, but right now it's still not worth investing for them.
---
Yes but Jormag didn't wake up because someone used the bow on them.
---
As a main guardian for Pve and Wvw, i would say you can Try either outfits or even the Bioluminescense armor collection, or just go with the normal versión that doesnt glow, it looks heavy but aint bulky.
---
Also you can get arah armor set that is cool and also not as bulky.
---
What race and gender you play?
---
I'm considering starting gw2 as the games I play are really struggling at the moment, mtx and lack of content and just pure bad content. My question is will I have to play hundreds of hours before I feel relevant? I so the game endgame focused like wow, or is it more about the journey than the destination, more like a single player rpg?
---
I work for CGI, a gaming software company in Canada as a webdev and it's true. It would take a team to rebuild the entire chat from scratch and I guarantee anet would never do it, as much as I'd like to see them support it
---
lol I don't care.
---
it blows my mind that anet has left so much money on the table by not implementing such basic feature,
---
Russian community could have easily been 2-3 times bigger
---
I just want to point out that this is actually the second time that has been posted on the TP. The first one sold so fast that it was barely noticed, but if you look closely on any of the TP graph websites, there us one that sold before. 
---
That being said, this could be the same one just listed at a higher price.
---
It supports Katakana symbols very well, that's definitely not Chinese.
---
And Ekko’s Q is basically Shield 5
---
I find I am very confused about masteries and what to focus on. Been 80 for two days.
---
That's anet for you. They're as greedy as possible.
---
Give it a month, check back again. If the drop rate stays above what TP barons can buy up and resell us for ten times the price, it'll drop significantly.
---
Else you're fucked over thrice.
---
Not gonna lie i bought heart of thorn first and level my ele but after a few years and buy pof i havent really touched the game cause i dont know what is good right now and whats not good right now xD
---
Continue moving the goalpost of the argument and taking jabs at people. Going from the assumption that "You have no experience with wikis" to "lol, you do have experience but that's not enough" and throwing around more assumptions that I may or may not have taken part in policy debate.
---
All I'll bother responding to is this:
---
&gt;What's your goal, a good resource, or a moral high-ground where you're right and everyone else is wrong?
---
A good resource, of course. The wiki is very good at what it does. Could some areas be better? Anything and everything is open to improvement in some way but if I don't have an issue with how things are being delivered on the pages I'm looking at, then I don't see a reason to personally edit it.
---
And:
---
&gt;That side is creating their own websites, with better guides and tools than your "collaborative cesspit" where there are no rules and no guidelines.
---
You have yet to link to anything terrible in the wiki, despite me asking two posts ago to show something you're alluding to, and yet, you throw out terms like "Collaborative Cesspit" as if the wiki is an absolute mess. The level of hyperbole you're spouting leads me to believe you're talking out of your ass in hopes of making an argument.
---
The ego problem comes from those not willing to help because they wanna do things their own way, and then pulling information straight from the wiki, rearranging it to suit them and then expecting to get money from it, either from donations or ad revenue. In other words, profiting off of other people's work by changing it just enough to make it your own.
---
And you cannot tell me that people like Dulfy and Ayinmaiden do not look at the wiki, forums or sub-reddit for their info, in conjunction to their own findings.
---
depends which masteries you want to get and what is causing confusion. HoT offer quite a bit of mobility options, in PoF you should get the mount masteries to tier 3 as  that is required to unlocked the next set of mounts and then later work on finishing them
---
Bear in mind that redeeming the decoration will just put it in the decoration storage for the guild where you redeem it. If you don't have decoration privileges in that guild, you won't be able to actually place the decoration anywhere.
---
Cute. Not quite that "totally not Overwatch" Chinese knockoff, but there were clearly "inspirations" taken.
---
Honestly really well done video in my opinion. I hope something happens with this, and wish you the best of luck. Thanks for being a part of the community all these years! &lt;3
---
Ecto gambling is good, because after you get burned on it and lose all your gold, you think very hard about whether you want that to happen again in a real life casino. It's good to get that harsh slap in the face in a video game, where it doesn't matter, rather than the real world.
---
Do you need the stuffs you get for it?
---
I'd also like this to be translated into Japanese, which has been a common appeal I think since GW2 launched. It's not for me, but my sister in law, who would love to play but finds the English a bit of a challenge.
---
i wonder who the voice actor of jormag is.
---
Jormag has been influencing while asleep for centuries. Svanir is a direct result of Jormag's corruption.
---
I got downvoted too. Strange.
---
Anyway, I just meant I’ve played some other MMO’s where you can put in a special report and GM’s would spawn in and correct it in real time. You harps to wait around a bit - like 20-30 mins, but they turned up eventually. Maybe that’s not possible though.
---
[deleted]
---
Actually the opposite. Anet made a big mistake creating national servers. First, you can't give every language an equal treatment, second, it's simply not balanceable, when it comes to linking and such.
---
I wouldn't mind to have Cyrillic letter supported, but I would mind however another language in open chat I can't even read. I hate it already that lots of the germans / french / spanish chat in their language in open for everyone chats, and secluding others with it. (I am one of these 3,still don't like it, even in my own mother tongue.)
---
Not too hard but hope this helps someone out.
---
I don't really want to get death threats in English, German, French **and** Russian...
---
They should add support for whole UTF-8 in chat, problem solved - everyone can use whatever symbols they want.
---
impossible. they died. 2008

Next level furry x asura shit

Hahha, I remember a squad in WvW cornering a different server, with a lot of devs too, not letting them move out of the starting area. Everyone laughed that we will all get banned and I have no f. idea what was going on, what we are doing and what's illegal about it, but the temptation man, it was too strong xd
---
1 handed swords have dozens of types, and hundreds of sub-types, and they all got packed as 1 type of weapon. 
---
Having a second type of shield instead more shield skins is extreme unlikely.

At most they could give shields to thieves, and they would use it as a buckler to deflect attacks rather than block them, making it a shield that evades instead blocking, thus not being affected by unblockable attacks.
---
Yes, I don't speak a word of Dutch but I was able to talk with everyone I met in the Netherlands without a problem, but it is not the same if you go to Russia, only a small portion of the population speaks English, so they will have to type something like "zdrastvuyte" instead of "Здравствуй"
---
Russian text and possibility to write on russian exist only in Shop. Looks like for ArenaNet, russians exist only if they need to take payment. No partnerships for russians, no answer on letters... Russians for ArenaNet exist only as money... it hurts
---
For fuck sake, let them use  Cyrillic!
---
I know, because I thought it was talking about the Druid class, not the Soulbeast class, which is why I was confused why the Druids were Nerfed because they were never awesome.
---
Thx for clearing things up :)
---
Looks very pretty :3 Happy gaming!
---
It's not worth tryharding all clearly lost games for the 1% chance you actually turn it around. I'll take the loss so I can queue again faster, thanks
---
If people just accepted a losing state, they could go on to play more games in a day, get more rewards, and get more opportunities to learn how they let a game become so lost in the first place
---
average is not median

---
&gt;You agree to data collection in the ToS of those services.
---
Yes ofc never said something different did i ?
---
its just hilarious that different people fear " THEY COLLECTED DATA " but Literarily everyone does it , and by tons.
---
You did apparently care enough to not only check it out, but also actually comment on it.
---
Holy shit you are right. I have finally seen the world for what it is. You made me realize that even though I hate society, *I live in a society!*
---
The support for CJK in font that GW2 Western client uses is minimal and IIRC far from complete; hell, even Latin characters with diacritical marks aren't supported fully - change in chat font size castrates these letters out on the fly.
---
Both Firebrand &amp; Renegade in both Quickness &amp; Alacrity have much more modern boon-application gameplay than Chrono.  Having to wait on wells to proc and position intelligently is an unnecessary hassle.  That's really just it.  Whether we're talking F2 or F3 on Firebrand; condition cleansing or providing stability Firebrand does it without jumping through hoops.  
---
It's an Elite Specialization that was tailor made for WvW and has exceptionally powerful condition cleansing on Chapter 2: Radiant Recovery and Chapter 5: Eternal Oasis.  These are ridiculously powerful and unlike Druid's Celestial Avatar you can stagger their use -- you don't have to use tome skills within 9-10 second window like Celestial Avatar.  You can get stability from F3: Chapter 1 (Unflinching Charage), "Stand Your Ground" (Shout) or Mantra of Liberation. 
---
... then you take a hot second and realize that Druid *only* provides stability when Spirit of Nature slams in a small radius around it, or that Chrono only does the same with Mantra of Concentration or Well of Precognition both of which require giving up either Well of Recall or Well of Action and are much, much more limited in their effective application.  
---
Firebrand trivializes access to powerful condition cleansing and defensive boons like stability.  You look at pretty much any other support under the sun except *maybe* Renegade, it's partner, and... you just feel bad.
---
As others have said, the expansions go on offer from time to time. Currently the full price standard version of Path of Fire is £26, but this includes HoT, as HoT is bundled for free with all versions of PoF.  £26 is, for me, pretty cheap given all of the extra stuff that has been added since HoT. 
---
The only other thing I want to say is make sure you purchase the game from an official seller. You can find out whether a seller is an official seller of GW2 through this link: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers.
---
Purchasing the game from another vendor is risky.
---
I think it has more to do with some gw2 assets in the background, like the moon and the logo
---
This entire thread makes no sense to me, I may not play druid but how tf does the chrono/scourge changes warrant a response from people that these classes are just dead in raids.
---
I'm aware that the scourge changes hit wvw/pvp but now having guaruntee 10man f3 + herald's sorrow (sand savant cap BUFFED to 10man) and now having guaruntee 10man cleanse is PRETTY GOOD. And the shade adjustment overall has no affect on either heal or condi scourge's playstyle. Condi scourge's benchmark will remain the same, and it will serve the same main purpose as it did before: epi. If u only have scourge as a condi class and need to play it for condi fights, go ahead. Legit idk why people are all about "omg ur playing scourge on cairne or matthias, thats not meta" those people can shut tf up, they're elitists, they're not playing competatively and neither are you (probably) so play whatever tf you want as long as ur not blatantly inting.
---
Chrono DR got an ICD, HOWEVER it now procs on any cc instead of interupts (icd is 3s, slow proc is 3s) which means its still going to be a dps increase to run over time catches up (on support chrono) if u have no dgh's. The other trait changes dont affect support chrono AT ALL. I'm not swapping chronophantasma for a mini quick well. LT was already out of the meta as it became obsolete after the guard changes and besides, if u needed slow uptime DR was almost always the better choice, still will be even after alac was removed.
---
Like, it pisses me off when people complain about the state of raiding and then when anet tries to shake up the meta, people just complain about how anet is making raid inaccessible to players, which is exactly OP's argument here.
---
It is not lol
---
Why are some countries so against learning and using English? 
---
It's the most international language and should be tought before the age of 10 in every country
---
It's actually kind of annoying when people from France, Germany, Russia, Portugal etc. insist on never learning it and then they get mad when a game available worldwide doesn't cater to them
---
One of the only? Just look at last two ESO patches. Or visit WoW forums...
---
There’s also so, so, so many games and maps out there this has to happen a lot. Maybe it isn’t a coincidence here but still
---
even more so with latest rules from US and EU
---
If one is warsong gulch i might have to fire this game up.
---
A chariot!
---
Even in the West it is a bit of a gray area legally speaking.
---
I think [Arena.net](https://Arena.net) is a big company to do what you are talking about. It is possible to make a chat from scratch, add support for different languages ​​into it, and then, along with any update, integrate it seamlessly into the game. Why on the Russian server WoW I can write in both Cyrillic and Latin? On the video there were examples of how, without full localization, chatting in Cyrillic was added. Why do some can and others not? Why can't a company meet players who have supported its game for such a long time? Especially when she (company) is approached by a blogger who popularizes the game in the Russian-speaking territory, at a time when the overwhelming majority in this territory plays f2p projects? Why can so many people overcome themselves, start paying for a game, start playing, sometimes (not all learn English at schools), in a language they don’t even know except hello and ok? So why can't a company get out of its comfort zone, sit a couple of days over the new chat functionality and please the community that loves its game so much?
---
I remember when this exact complaint was about Chrono...sigh, better days.
---
I’d love to see a comic of these guys and their adventures upon returning to Tyria, full of humour like this.
---
If you are just starting out with fractals or doing them casually it's completely fine with going GS + mace/mace as a power warrior.
---
But it's actually a 10 v 10 mode, something that WvW guilds would love to see. In the the "real" guild wars it's really hard to have fair guild fights.
---
We truly do live in a society.
---
Every question you asked is answered and thoroughly explained here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system
---
For me and my friends it was the combat system what made it fun in the first place. It totally had potential, but horrendous balance like skills doing a multitude of things, over the top effects, internal cooldowns, class specific buffs hidden in the UI, the current way conditions work or simply bad numbers everywhere made it fail.
---
You can, you just don't want to put enough effort into it. And it's fine, PvP is entirely different beast, you may not have fun with it and you don't need to.
---
How to reproduce this?
---
Would be marvelous to have the possibility to chat with russian-speaking friends on common language in the gamechat, instead of breaking mind and fingers while trying to type down an ***understandable*** message.
---
I haven't mained thief in PvP since Season 1 (and haven't really played much PvP for the past 2 years) but I can already think of a couple of ways of how this could be really powerful (if it  only recharges a skill on CD). I think it's going to be pretty powerful imo.
---
https://youtu.be/JU2mA3tVRVU?t=1074  O_O
---
To be fair, Dulfy made that guide before it was numbered. Any other guide since then that was numbered AFAIK I think she followed in game numbering. 
---
However, your comment does have me pondering a way to try to have it so the wiki is able to show  the way to collect things that is easiest way for players as well as show the in game ordering too. So thanks!
---
Thought it was another "hey look some random game stole gw2 assets", my bad
---
I understand that if your native language uses a different alphabet it can be dumb and frustrating if you can't use that alphabet in the videogame you play with friends.  
---
  
---
But I feel like your appeal is not completely honest. Saying Russians have to read the wiki in English as if it's some sort of major problem is a little lame. Obviously there are many many people who have a native language that's not English. We all have all learned the language to play videogames etc.  
---
Cyrillic Alphabet, fine. Asking for an entire localization? Idk man. I guess Anet will consider it a net loss to do that. They probably won't pull many new players in while spending a fair bit of money on localization.
---
I'd appreciate it if you could make your point without the ad hominems.
---
I'd wager a good 50% of time spent in fractals (in fast groups) is just spent running between fights. Fractal god does nothing for you in that regard.
---
When it comes to pug groups, the time saved from having that extra 7% is still pretty miniscule.
---
&gt;Lastly, you are not constrained by one daily per day. You can do unlimited fractals daily, title grants additional reward per each fractal for ever.
---
Yes, that's true. Fractal god does unlock a decent gold farm (though I personally find it to be dreadfully boring and I'd rather do literally anything else in the game instead).
---
&gt;Obviously you are not aware of anything i just said, but ok, play as you like, just please do not share your noobish way of playing backed with some idiotic math with new players who are seeking advice from experienced players.
---
I'd wager I've been playing this game for longer and have more knowledge about it than you at this point. Remember, I never said fractal god was bad, I just said that it's not free to get and is probably not worth the investment for most of the people playing this game. For those who think they're going to be playing for more than 2-3 years (and clearing fractals daily in that entire time span), yes, it's worth getting. For the more casual crowd? Absolutely not.
---
holy ship that shipping is expensive
---
I do not quite agree that in Russia the majority plays in F2P projects. Yes, such games have their own large audience, but not the largest, IMHO. In my opinion, most still play in paid projects - like Diablo 3, Destiny -2, The Witcher, WoW, ESO, God of War, Battlefield, and so on. etc.
---
Yeah I'm just saying hammer is better than mace/mace on zerker. Unless you need ranged cc like on qadim 2.0. If you don't need that much cc, just go Axe/mace for your swap.
---
&gt;So why can't a company get out of its comfort zone, sit a couple of days over the new chat functionality and please the community that loves its game so much?
---
You're totally missing the point here.
---
If they could do it in the matter of a few days they would've already done it. I suspect they'd have to essentially rewrite the entire chat system from the ground up and dig through piles of old spaghetti code to make it work.
---
This isn't going to take a few days. It's going to take weeks or months of effort; time they certainly can't afford spending on a (relatively) small issue when ~1/3rd of the company had to go half a year ago due to split focus across different projects. They need to focus on the future of the game itself or it might not have one at all.
---
Look, I get it. You want the ability to communicate in Russian and I totally understand that, but the cost-benefit ratio of implementing this likely can't be justified at the moment.
---
AFAIK Ayin is still doing guides, no worries. =)
---
Swapping weapons for optimal combos. I know a few players in my guild that come from WoW and they don't want to swap weapons because they have been years using "just a greatsword".
---
I said "just learn English" because other Countries who don't have their alphabets in game are doing just fine. 
---
Although I get why it may have sounded overly mean.
---
Also, I don't think what I wrote was Xenophobic, the motivation of my reply was not to harass him because he is russian (which I don't even know if he is), but mainly to say 'Anet has better things to do then implement a language'. Which they obv. don't care about, and I think there is nothing wrong with that.
---
you need winter presence,go to wardrobe,click on back item  skin&gt;try to reskin it and reset,it shoud pop another stack of  winter presence.
---
That's still Latin script - with diacritical marks around Latin letters.
---
That's the same as going, "you know you can communicate with an other program".
---
This game is about communication and not about secluding everyone who doesn't speak language. And english is the global language, so just live with writing in English in chats where everyone could read it.
---
Company is in NA, so dont expect them to think theirs even a world outside america
---
But where do stop then? What about Arabic, Vietnamese or Thai? Those have playerbases too.
---
what country are you from and how many languages have you learned?

WTF is going on. Human Charr war? Is this gw1!

OP is asking a genuine question so  'no dont delete' is enough, no need for the condescending cringe.
---
Exquisite choice, sir.
---
It's doable, losing 30% max hp is worse coupled with that dang fireball/quickness instability and a down is a perma down really quickly
---
y does it give u 10hp on using it. that makes u instantly down by any hit u get. thats stupid. even more stupid for wvw. REEEEEEEEEE
---
There's already a comment in this thread about that.
---
They should tho. You can't play an online games with a international playerbase and have no english knowledge, but expect that others adjust to you. It's not like the majority isn't going the extra mile but expect you to do it. Nearly everyone does.
---
"no don't delete" wouldn't be enough and you know it.
---
It's kinda somewhere in the middle compared to other MMOs. Getting your first character to 80 and in decent gear might take you a couple hundred hours, and you really won't "feel relevant" until then. The game is mostly open world PvE focused, and all of the important open world zones are level 80, so you could consider it to be somewhat endgame focused.
---
There are 24 zones below level 80 that you'll go through to get to level 80, but after that, there are 26 (and increasing) zones for level 80 characters to explore that continue the story through expansions and minor DLCs.
---
This game has instanced PvE for 5 or 10 players, but that's not the main focus of the game at all. They're not supported or developed nearly as much as the open world PvE, so if you're looking for a wide variety of dungeons and raids, this won't be the game for you.
---
It would probably benefit every new player if you mentioned some standard moneymaking methods (getting better gear aint always cheap) like farming rich nodes, or doing daily crafting etc. Aside from this, explaining the lfg system and mentioning the gw2 wiki / gw2 efficiency would also be a good idea.
---
Ah, every time a gw2 fan thinks Anet didn't lift every concept in the game from elsewhere.. xD
---
Why should everyone learn English? Why is GW2 localized in French, German, Spanish, Korean, Chinese, but can’t localize (or at least add the Cyrillic alphabet) in Russian? Why do I calmly play Russian in Warframe, Destiny -2, The Witcher, ALL Blizzard games, God of War, Anthem, ESO, and almost ALL Western games, except GW2? Why is this attitude towards Russian players?
---
Almost all video game developers are well aware that people are comfortable playing in their own language. And, in the case of the maximum number of localizations, they will have the maximum amount of profit. Why Anet has not yet handed over this, it is not entirely clear to me, especially since GW1 was localized in Russian.
---
I did some "tools" to bring custom fonts and even ru localisation to gw2, but noone is interested in that as well as anet.
---
The most important ones, IMO, are:  
---
Core Tyria - Pact commander for auto loot  
---
HoT - max Gliding, cuz it's used all over the place  
---
PoF - mount masteries to improve their abilities
---
PoF gives you lots of MPs, so you can max those out pretty quickly.  The HoT masteries require the most MPs, but a lot of them are useless outside of specific maps/game modes.  The mount abilities from PoF masteries can actually help you get some of the Core/HoT masteries, too.
---
What is there to adjust to? Occasionally seeing another language in chat? Such hardship, game is now ruined.
---
no idea. depends if you know what you're doing or just derping around. could take 5h, could take 2 months. entirely up to you! use the sidebar for some great info!

I'm Chinese. Your comment was just silly.
---
we have a weekly question thread for simple questions like these, but in general, it’s not recommended to speed through the level system especially first time playing. Fastest lvl0-80 is 10hrs iirc with full exp buff, and masterieries takes a but longer but you need to collect enough points to even level them up.
---
It doesn't work apparently. When I try to type 我们 only the 人 radical is visible, 门 ain't.

With the best cleave in the game, if we're talking PvE.
---
I really wanna hear a argument at some point and not just some emotional "what does it bother you" or "what about that poor guy/girl who refuses to learn english.   
---
It's just outright rude when you write/speak in front of everyone in a language noone besides your buddies understands.
---
I'm 2 points short on getting auto-loot from the 5th mastery in Pact Commander, and I'm not sure where the easiest points are available.
---
Basically, I need some tips with regards to core Tyria mastery point acquisition, and what's easiest. I have all the Fractal Attunement ones, 4/5 Pact Commander, and 1/4 Legendary Crafting. I'm at max XP with both Pact Commander and Legendary Crafting so right now I'm just wasting XP, but also out of mastery points. Personal story done, LW S2 completed (but not achievements), all the open world points communed.
---
I've been spending the last 2 hours in The Silverwastes, but haven't seen any of the legendary bosses that achievements say are random spawns and should give mastery points, so I'm thinking this isn't the optimal path. Any tips on other mastery points that are easy to get?
---
And, side question, how rare are the Silverwastes legendary bosses?
---
It is not uncommon for people to mention it when they join a squad and find that the instance is full. There is also an indirect message, the one about minis being hidden. That happens when the instance hits its softcap.
---
Hey, we talk about  cyrillic only. We don't want  localization  ))
---
"i assumed the OP stole an image despite it clearly being a drawing of player specific gw2 characters, here's an unrelated anime picture I found on google". Downvotes exist for pointless comments.

You should edit the title, this is way too broad.

---
I still don't get why, if the problem with guardian scepter is that it's too good in close combat, they don't just reduce damage when close.
---
Nerfing guardians only real ranged weapon because of melee is silly.
---
So, you SERIOUSLY tell the Russian-speaking community to communicate BETWEEN THEM in English? I'm afraid to destroy your world, but not everyone in the world speaks English. Not everyone in the world speaks spoken English. Moreover - not everyone in the world knows English above the basic (school) level. I’ll also notice that there are also schools in the post-Soviet space with German, French, and Spanish. And so, do you suggest that all this Russian-speaking community communicate BETWEEN THEM in English? Good. For example, why should not the English-speaking community playing, conditionally, the Korean MMORPG on the Korean server, start to communicate in Korean BETWEEN THEM? Why not? They play a game in Korean, which means there should be no problems with the language. The fact that English reigns in the world does not mean in any way that everyone speaks English without exception. And if you watched a movie or a series (hi McGyver) and they speak English in some Russian village in it, this does not mean that in life it is like that.

after 4 years of nerfs... im confartably numb.

but fuck i was enjoying scourge heal and i refuse to play firebrand as something that doesnt lit things on fire.

Less merchandise. More game. Please.

Just for super speed gyro.

He could be just uninformed. If he doesnt know keeping a character doesn't give him any advantages, then deleting isn't out of consideration.
---
That is also inconsistent. :/

So the answer is: both.

Its not, but you can wreck those skelks if you want.

well it was after silverwastes was released and i havent looked since then
---
Pressing Prt Scr is faster than reaching for your phone, opening the camera app, and taking a picture with shaky hands.
---
One charr! One charrrrrrr!!!
---
Meh ... it's a mixed. There are some good points balanced by some equally bad points by some short sighted people tunnel visioning on a single aspect of the game.
---
Like /u/edenstrife already said, there is still a decent player base for all game modes - If you're interested in WvW, you might have to invest some (ingame) money to get to the right server though, since not all Servers are actively doing WvW.
---
Joining a guild that focuses on whatever you wanna do the most is also a good idea, helps getting into groups without having to fulfill insane requirements (E.g. the raiding and high end fractal communities can be pretty elitist in this regard). Since you can be in up to Five guilds at the same time, you can also search one guild for every type of content you wanna play and join all of them.
---
The community itself is pretty friendly imo (Compared to other games), asking in map or guild chat is probably the fastest way to get Information if a 5s Google search didn't answer your question
---
&gt;I mean reaper minion mancer was the better option anyway. 
---
If you believe that to be true, shouldn't you be against the move; especially since it makes the balance between them worse?
---
Your race is irrelevant. As was your comic to my fact check. But after some digging I realized my old man brain has mistakenly wandered back into 4Chan. There is no logic or critical thinking here. Just drama.

Not a lot of people in North America buy shit on [wish.com](https://wish.com) ...
---
Yeah why would you support a language that has 150 million native speakers, that would be bad from a marketing standpoint .... god people like you.
---
I would be mad, but their game is more optimized than GW2.
---
Yes I'm a god thanks. 150 million native speakers won't mean 10.000 new players/payers just because of a localization. I'm pretty sure that the people asking for a localization speak the English language just fine. Localization don't occur with the snap of a finger. They have to go through all the text and translate it properly, that's a hell of a lot of work. Which also means it will cost them a fair a bit of money.  
---
Introducing a Cyrillic alphabet of their font is a lot less costly and is something I do expect them to do.
---
Might be useful to BM people gyro.

There's a very good chance GW2 is punblished/ran in China by Tencent. There's an equally good chance Eternal Magic also is owned by them.
---
I might be completely wrong but I remember hearing there's a separate gw2 with its own servers for Chinese players. I imagine that one supports Chinese characters. I might be confusing this with another game though.

Some people are just stuck in time.... (sigh)

We just need to talk on our nation language with our friends. Is it so hard for you?

yup, but is it one ? :)
---
Story loot (as in final drops in form of chests and exp) is always the same and chests say if they are affected by MF.
---
Identifying unid gear is no longer affected by MF.
---
Why? Do you talk with your friends on another language? We can't talk with russians on russian. Do you understand? That is it. Nonsence. So for we ask to add Cyrillic in the game chat.

Is it a nerf when you could in theory use a utility skill, steal, and then use that utility again if it was the only one on cooldown? That requires the trait only proccing on skills that are on cooldown of course, which is not clear. It could also just say "i recharge slot 2 now" at random, regardless if the skill is on cooldown or not.

What does "general node farm" entail exactly?

Nope, nope, nope and nope. I have played plenty of online games with cyrillic character support, and the more russians there are in games like that the more toxic the game generally is. Obviously I am generalizing here and not all russians are like that, but russians tend to have this weird superiority complex and a habit of trying to speak russian to everyone and anyone regardless if the person they are talking to are russian.
---
And OP here has blatantly ripped off this from another [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/da3w3x/eternal_magics_pvp_arena_looks_super_similar_to/) on this very sub.
---
Looks like Fire/Arcane/Weaver because of the boons on swap and the aura in fire attunement.
---
I use 12345 for skills
---
QERTFG for utilities
---
ZXCVB for attunements
---
Thank you. I'm going to try out a couple of different things to see what feels the most natural and fluid. Appreciate the input!
---
Xp gain scales aswell. So you can level in any zone you want to. Personalities don't matter at all outside of the but of text at the start of your story journal. It once mattered a tiny bit more, but now it's just flavour and your choices don't matter
---
Im pretty sure classic WoW proves the capabilities game developers have in returning old content
---
&gt; But if you do like the minor convenience, Runecrafter's would be the choice replacement for Mystic Salvage Kits, rather than Silver-Fed.
---
What? Runecrafter isnt better the Silverfed pretty much always, only for rares below lvl 68 it has better results, but lets be hones how many of them do you even get?
---
It's a community-organized Wintersday event similar to Secret Santa. You sign up on the website, are assigned another IGN, and during the festival you send them a gift in-game. It doesn't have to be huge; things like exclusive dyes, minis, BL weapon skins, some crafting materials (ascended, T6, gemstones, etc.) all work well. Some people naturally take advantage of this and sign up to receive a gift, but do not send one in return, but there are many people who volunteer to send the people who've been 'scammed' a gift anyway. It's just a nice event for people to be helpful and generous and get into the holiday spirit.

Triple Trouble is very organised in the EU but it depends on the time there are guilds dedicated to it and often you see the same people multiple times a week, they usually do 2 runs a day sometimes even 3, - I recommend showing up 30 minutes beforehand in the map because they will give detailed explanation on what to do and the map instance can get full if you're a bit late! As for times I'm a mess with timezones I know there's a run around 4AM my time which is like 10PM in central Europe  there should be squads in the LFG around 9:30PM already this is the last run of the day, they sometimes do the one that's like 3 hours before that? In the LFG it will be under World Bosses and then the squads will usually say something like TTT Amber or Cobalt 
---
If you've done WvW/Fractals have you ever received the junk spoon item? They are part of the koutalophile collection 3 are random drops (RNG) and the rest can be bought around Tyria this also gives a Core Tyria Mastery Point but because of the RNG involved it might not be the quickest solution
---
Not exactly. For example, when starting a fight with no utilities on CD, you could use something like haste, steal, recharge it, and now get haste and have it available again for either a stun break or for more quickness.
---
It does something every steal now. This is going to be crazy for sustain, and give us options to take longer cool down skills. Remember, DD is also getting a 5 second reduction on steal, so DD builds are going to be using steal more often too.
---
that mostly helps for min fps not so much for avg fps and cases with lots of models in close proximity
---
Check under the subsheet with the same name. I'm trying to be more descriptive for all the farms I do, but for this, there is a list of map/nodes I went to when you check out the subsheet. Basically rich iron, rich platinum, flax farms, and other node farms.
---
I actually keep my elements on F1-F4, since I use 1-5 for the weapon skills anyway its not that awkward to reach a little higher for the swap. I use Q for Utility 3, E for heal and R for elite skill. The other 2 util skills + dodge are bound to my mouse. Although I should mention that I dont swap my keybinds when playing other classes so I tried to get a setup that just works with everything for me.
---
I miss my GW1 cape.
---
Nice response to my literal experience in China. But hey I'm sure you get a ton of exposure to Chinese culture sitting behind a keyboard railing against American consumerism.
---
Yes anything to bring more people to WvW , I'm a Wvw  community discord manager so I can share some of my experience.
---
Hahah, I wasn't smart enough to figure that out on my own, but thank you!
---
Not even savior complex - just typical reddit behavior mostly seen in default subs. Contrarian just to sound "smart". If he had a spirit animal, it'd be a fedora.
---
Thanks! That’s really nice to know! 
---
I looked at the EU one but it says I need ascended weapons and the like and as I’m awful at the game, I’ve never even looked at an ascended item XD so guess I’m gonna have to keep working at it before diving into raids :P
---
9900k @ 5.1 w/ 1080; I get damn near close to 60. 1080 is all you really need to max any graphic setting except in the grove.
---
I think the secret sauce is actually high ram-speed/low timings. It really, really evens out the framerate and I’m kind of surprised. And obviously single core speed.
---
In very few games does ram speed seem to affect anything. Notable exceptions include Gw2 and Overwatch. I know because I had Ram sticks I was running at 2k that had a 3k boost I didn’t even know about, and the changes in framerate for a few games changed while it didn’t really affect most.
---
And the charr who were born in ascalon before them somehow weren't?
---
Humans condemned every human left in ascalon to wander around as ghosts and reliving the past for all eternity, isn't that worse than death?
---
I am GameCube
---
And here i am, sitting at 40-60 fps while doin nothing and thibkibgbits enough xD
---
That's what I'm saying, mobile hardware is clearly on the same term as PC GPUs!
---
"humans have the best design"
---
Except humans weren't "designed"...they're literally just humans...which exist in real life. Why not play an MMO about getting an accounting job while you're at it.
---
I believe the cause was due to Program Files requiring admin permissions to modify. When starting up some files need to be written and it didn’t have the permissions to do so.
---
As long as it’s installed somewhere where you have full permissions to modify the directory and files it should work alright.
---
o/
---
I am surprised that reddit didnt ping me but oh well.
---
Sad to see you go, and thank ye for yer work, family  should supersed near everything and I am glad ye got yer priorities sorted.
---
Unless they only update neglect their pvp fanbase for years not much of a rip off tbh
---
Mind you, *if* they want to. For example, there's a dev I often see/play with, and while he has the ArenaNet tag (and he's actually answered AMA's on here), he doesn't often speak in special-colored chat, if at all.
---
(I'm deliberately not mentioning him because I wanna respect his privacy).
---
GMs and devs aren't the same people. Most of the A-Net tags are developers playing the game just like you and I. Not enforcing rules or anything.
---
GMs are never visible to normal players precisely because they want privacy. That way they're not bombarded with hundreds a whispers.
---
There was an arena in LA where Destiny's Edge was formed. Of course that was old LA, but I still have no clue where that was supposed to be.
---
You would be surprised how many other slavic countries would understand most of your language if you wrote in latin script.
---
If you wrote in english however most people will understand you, so isnt that the best?
---
I would be ok with cyrilic if it wouldnt work in map, team and local chat. As soon as that is the case there will be problems.
---
Man I might be new, but isn’t there a chat feature in this game?
---
Ha!
---
Classy, bro. Great way to show tribute to the city founded by the human that saved you from the Flame Legion.
---
I feel the same but ANet seems to have faith that we can bank on this saga and not an expansion so I want to see how it plays out. I'm not hopeful, but genuinely curious. They think players will be satisfied with this model more than an expansion model.
---
Yeah, TTT requires 3 experienced commanders to be coordinating with each other, so there are very few "last-minute" groups, most successful meta runs are pre-organized by guilds and start to fill quick once posted. 15-30 minutes ahead of time is your best shot to start looking.
---
As for fractals, I'm not super into them and have only done T1 so far, but I've found the masteries there were very easy to get without much extra effort, you just need to know what each map's mastery is before going in. Execeptions are a couple like "Kill every chicken on the map" that need the group to agree to it, but I've seen LFG postings for those specific achievements before.
---
This is great! The detail of the sylvari's few leaves on the table is top notch! 😂
---
That's pretty dope. What do you think is better, focus or dagger? I personally never tried focus so I'm curious if it's better.
---
I can read it and perhaps even guess the overall meaning of it because the first language I'm using on everyday basis - Polish, belongs to West Slavic group and what you wrote is perhaps a Russian - East Slavic language, written with Latin script but most likely not even following any transliteration system/models, thus, there's no grammatical sense in that sentence for me.
---
Even tho, this botched Latin script you used is more readable than случайная фраза написанная кириллицей, which without any additional sources available ad-hoc during gameplay time will be a pain in the ass for anyone to understand. But if there will be any Slovak, Czech, Pole (or any player from Southern Slavic nations) around and you type in Latin script, there's 70% chance they'll read you out correctly and pass your message meaning to the rest of the community and everyone will be more happy than if you'd go with text typed in Кири́ллиц and gave people around you blank faces.
---
Have an example from ground around us: [this post here from official forums](https://i.imgur.com/zXGPDjX.jpg) is more readable for me than anything you'd type in Cyrillic: *A big international Russian-language guild is recruiting players between level 1 and 80 for &lt;can't read that out, barely understandable for me&gt;. Ladies and gents! Our officers line-of-character-names will happily consider your application.*.
---
Now, type anything to me in Cyrillic script and I guarantee I won't be able to decipher it beyond letters R, V, S without using any translator (which I use for stuff up there and perhaps the meaning is lost anyway due to how Google Translate works and difference in grammar between Polish and Russian languages) and charmap.exe or some ridiculously small virtual keyboard, and mouse.
---
The general advice is again, work on your latinization - see which system seems to be the best and do work on your English - it doesn't have to be the Queen's English but readable enough for most of the people.
---
I mean I used to play at around the same FPS but that was before I shelled out a ton of cash on a new system, which would run the game at 100 FPS easy in theory, so it is kind of disappointing.
---
The Tempest Specialization for Elementalist is terrifying in PvP when played correctly. Can go through entire teams on its own with overloaded attunements. It literally often makes it so that enemies can’t even get close without being downed, in my experience.
---
I’m down I’ll hit you up
---
Agree but I feel like holosmith is the number one class that needs a nerfe.  Mesmers in general are a pain the ass and even if they nerfe it, they will still be a pain in the ass. Mesmers mechanics are built to annoy the hell of of you. Holosmith on the other hand... a good holosmith can wipe out an entire team. I've seen it and it's crazy.
---
What could _theoretically_ make the whole function gyro thing slightly less garbage, is if destroying function gyro would result in full on explosion. Damage and CC and blast. So yes, could be interrupted but there's still a chance it will kill/interrupt heal/do more damage to enemy situation.
---
Otherwise Warrior gets free "no gyro for you" as usual (while mesmer is useless)
---
&gt; honestly very disappointed by the terrible optimization
---
Welcome. Tybalt, introductions.
---
Seriously though, just limit your framerate to 30 and you're mostly fine outside of wvw.
---
Tencent owns most of China lol
---
It is likely a font issue. Even if a UTF encoding is in use, unless the font contains the character it cannot be rendered.
---
I agree but recently I’ve come across more than a few on the Devona’s Rest server that are extremely good at it. I play a Dragonhunter and had a team of a Chronomancer, a Necromancer, a Holomancer, and a Druid behind me in a 5v5 tournament. It was a very solid team and we worked well together. It was semifinals. There was a team of a Tempest and 4 others with other classes that we never even saw. They were camped out right in front of our respawn area and we never got past them. That one tempest could easily body us time and time again. We’ve seen other things since that are very similar.
---
True, since when do I have a top tier party when everyone's doing shit tier dps even in your "50 ess" groups l0l.
---
That's true, though I out perform all the power dps most of the time. Since when do you actually get a good group lol. If you do get a competent group, it's no issue, sure. But it's like raids, actually relying on people to do well is a meme.
---
From my experience, playing both power and condi. If your team isn't great, power class isn't so good anyway. If you can speed run the kill it makes sense, if you can't buff or burst properly with power classes, your condi will just carry them lol. You'll even have better burst damage, how funny is that.
---
If you have a good group, oh please, show me, I desperately require one.
---
ANet has expressed that they want it too, but I think it comes down to dev time, and monetizability.
---
It's called Twilight and it's one of the best skins in the game. Also has awesome particle effects.
---
bis is lifesteal tho
---
China owns Tencent*
---
Those shortcuts are insane!
---
Something you can do is use combinations for skills aswell- for example
---
I use SHIFT+12345 for my attunements, pinky on SHIFT means my hand stays in the same position for weapon skills without shifting to change. Works great with all professions. 
---
I have utilities bound on my mouse, but going QERTY is a pretty good option if you want minimal movement and don’t have or want a mouse with keys on it.
---
Pretty sure I've seen some of those other skills in Torchlight and Archage.
---
Hey, at least someone is doing something with the PVP in GW2
---
