Something that would be cool if you could do for all your videos, dulfy, is to add in your description the time links for each mount/skin etc. for those of us that just want to look for one mount :)

&gt; Is it?

&gt;

&gt;Regarding moving from Season 4 to Season 5, we announced this in the 6th Anniversary Celebration Video. We talked about wanting to release expansion level stories and features over the next couple years. Our goal is to create powerful moments like the final instance of this episode that are a culmination of multiple departments and raise the bar for what it means to be a Guild Wars 2 experience.

---
I love that update. 
---
I truly hope they don't bring back her from dead. 
---
It won't sting if the scaled deus ex machina comes back an episode after. And with death remaining death, the entire plot may get more interesting.
---
stay dead
---
Not really a bug, feels more like an oversight.
---
In de dwarven catacomb the green plate only drops for the person that activates the sarcophagus, not for everyone that killed the graveling. Leading to 20 players spamming the sarcophagus in hopes of being the lucky player that can advance the puzzle.
---
Yeah thats the part that would save it at least, dont get the 20% increased stab duration in this context at all.
---
Death is kinda meaningless in the GW universe due to the Mists. You can meet just about anyone in the Mists as we've seen recently with Snaff, Eir, and Glint. 
---
So might as well just have Aurene in the Mists for plot reasons moving forward without an overpowered dragon pet.
---
Krakatoa dye pack but no dyes that look like Krakatoa..
---
So.... picking specifically at his "in the next couple of years" and pressing avoidance of naming the development of expansions, actually mean that we won't even see an expansion in 2020, if.... ever?
---
The AI has already traced your signal, don't worry about it.
---
When the time is nigh, the big Arena.net symbol in the sky will show you the way to the land where zone transitions are seamless, the view distance is endless, the lighting is so volumetric you could touch it and Aurene is still alive and playing hide and seek with you. Oh and high detail and model limit with 144fps as a bonus because MO loves us.
---
Except it's probably very similar code as the S3 portal tome. And just because the tome UI can hold 6 slots max doesn't mean they have to fill it up.
---
I can't finish the story as the hammer kicks me every time the last cutscene plays...
---
You mean you don't thank Percy Spencer every time you microwave your lunchbox?
---
Am... Am I the only one?!
---
That's the thing - back then they stopped adding armor sets to the gemstore bc people complained about not getting new armor from anywhere else in the game. Now that we're actually getting ingame obtainable armor sets again, there's no reason for them not to add back armor sets on the gemstore. I do think that they're continuing with outfits bc they're easier for them to create though.
---
Maybe, but remember Caithe's flowers, the "branding" that Aurene gave to Caithe, faded during the scene, signifying an actual death.
---
That's fairly solid evidence that GW2's expansion days are done.
---
It's called positive reinforcement. Talk to your parents about it.
---
I call toilet paper company every time I wipe my ass and compliment them how awesome was the experience
---
The very last reveal was very strong, I admit. But I'm fed up with anet killing off everyone left and right so  I'd have chosen the boring fairy tale ending instead of what we got.
---
Not to mention that based on the ending all hope is lost, and a comeback from this state will feel cheap and dumb most likely. Maybe it's time for me to let the story go, and just use a Teleport to friend to get to the new maps from now on.
---
I can so imagine Snargle being all "damn I fucked up Tyria's last hope... *again*."
---
I mean, he even made Kralk cooler: now he is gonna wear a badass pirate's eye patch...
---
Who's Gwen?
---

Infusing or attuning the new Jalis ring makes it have no name and the verata signet icon.
---
I‚Äôm more of a bandit dog person.
---
Reminded me about the Nuke helicopter crash in COD 4.
---
Oh, its even worse imo.
---
I'd be stoked if we could get it as an outfit and armor. Even if they decided on some 'lower budget' armor where they just slash the outfit into appropriate armor pieces (around waist level for chest, elbow and down for gloves etc). Would make mitching and matching a bit harder, but way better than no mixing and matching at all. 
---
For what I've figured out, there are 2 meta events, one North and one South, both spawning alternately at xx:45 every hour. Each one rewards you with a part of a plate, which, when needed, are needed to open the dwarven vault. The North meta rewards you with some of the Branded currency and the jewels required to craft dragonblood weapon, which from what I heard is also inside the dwarven vault. Dragonblood weapons also require a good amount of the map currency, meaning those events will be pretty popular in the next weeks. . I had the opportunity to lead the North meta, the rewards were rather good, several champs, the jewel I mentioned and many trash mobs which can be good with karmic retribution if you're in need of karma.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We can just use philosophers stones from the mystic forge, it'll be fine
---
I got out of the instance and my character shouts "I deserve an award". Made me chuckle in a slightly grim kinda way.
---
Something to consider; it was pointed out that he was using Zhaitan's magic, but he also absorbed Mordremoths magic too (which is mind-based). 
---
üòç
---
Or inside Caithe... Sort of like how Spock put himself inside McCoy or how Voldemort used horcruxes.
---
they said the same when season 1 started and we know how well "no expansion" business model was for them :)

Oh yeah, I **immediately** disabled by silly mini pet during that moment.

&gt; Slippery slope was not supposed to be included on cliffside, we will remove it in a future patch.

For others that still need this step, you can also get it outside the circles on any branded.

I wouldn't know... The story cutscene kept crashing me out of that last instance...
---
[It gave me Uncharted 4 flashbacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvk8tI8RoG0)

remove instabilites all together, they're shit and bring nothing interesting
---
Any ideas how to get blue or other yellow plates?
---
I know at least 2 ppl what will swear in multiple languages tmr :-D
---
Yes... I can't believe I was able to do all story instances without crashing on loading into them like the last 3 patches on EU servers... Hopefully that means they have the problem sorted now.
---
I sooo wanted Caithe to die. She became more important and I had to cry over Aurene. Ugh... Why : &lt;
---
How about we just don't since they are still a profit orientated company and a "smooth launch" is something that shouldn't deserve a special shoutout?
---
https://imgur.com/a/Qw5R5pm :)
---
Same... Can't deal with this... Just stood in shock for 10 minutes and left... for now my commander doesn't feel like living or fighting for anything anymore.
---
Thanks for the amazing story Anet, the quality in story telling is just growing to levels that i never thought it would be possible in a video game, you guys and gals are amazing. Unfortunately, I've became so emotionally attached to the bond between my character and Aurene that, after this, i don't know what to do... Right now I'll just sleep it off with mixed feelings of shock and curiosity for what will be 3 months ahead...
---
"We talked about wanting to release expansion level stories and features over the next couple years."
---
Expansion level stories and features in LW episodes "over the next couple of years" sounds pretty solid to me.
---
Bosses, trash mobs, allies, and weapons are still randomly invisible in fractals.
---
Dont know if its bug or very old feature/joke you forgot to turn off. Also new fractal is trash/dps golem fiesta. Pls no more shitty fractals like that i would rather wait 3x longer for 99/100 quality fractals.

Yeah. I feel exactly the same about a character we lost in HoT. ;(
---
I quit when I had to kill my beloved Balthazar. 
---
No one ofc. I fucking hate instabilities. They are just straight ip fucking retarded and annoy the shit out of me. Fuck fractals.
---
that means the team supporting the game is getting cut and moved to other project
---
She respawns in Tarir due to Joko's magic.
---
Suck it Kralk, I'll bring her back after feeding her some magic. 
---
Which one is that?
---
Nice, is it in the gemstore?

Diviner stats cannot, at this time, be selected from experimental or refined envoy armor.

---
Well denial is the first phase so good luck with the others. 
---
They're almost certainly using AWS at this point. Infrastructure costs are pretty minimal from a setup perspective. GW1 moved to AWS a while ago, and its clear part of their one-world move likely included a cloud migration as well.
---
agree with this -- I still run the world bosses occasionally, and it's great that even though you're maxed out, your effective level is whatever the region permits, so there's reason to go back and explore old zones without just steamrolling everything you come across, effectively making it boring.
---
"Will be romved in a future patch" But till then, fuck you all lmao
---
Joko wasn't immortal because Aurene ate his magic, Aurene isn't immortal because Kralkatorrik ate hers.
---
i hope not 
---
Panic mesmer is back at service :3
---
&gt; That slow walk reminded me of the Mass Effect 3 ending.
---
Had the very same thought.
---
Now, what if Anet pulled a full ME3 on us and did the blue ending? Aurene's mind going into Kralk and fusing with his mind, like Shepard's mind was fused with Reapers? :P
---
"Look at them..."
---
But there's no sub fee so it's fine. /s
---
Good thing she's immortal thanks to absorbing/eating Palawa Joko
---
***THEY'RE SELLING CHAWCOLATES!!!***
---
yes, that was the hardest part. Normally you can talk with all NPCs at the end of an episode.
---
Had fun with it and honestly there are others that are bothering me more (3000000000000% dmg when randomly hit by a mob) but yea fix bugs/glitches and disable it on few fracs
---
I still use it, except for ls patches. Swapping gear stats and runes is so unnecessary. 
---
Don't you have a daredevil? :P
---
I reset my sound options like the game notes suggested with the music volume change and now I'm sitting here wondering what other amazing ambiance I've been missing during the other episodes. It's so satisfying hearing all of the tiny details.
---
You can also buy the parts off the trading post, but right now they are prohibitively expensive for most players (100 gold, really?). If you want to do it that way, I suggest you wait a week for the prices to go down.
---
They did also take a moment at the start to establish joko dying as important, ogden said it was one of the three signs he was waiting for 
---
I mean Glint was also killed but still exists in the mists, so Aurene can hopefully do the same.
---
I‚Äôm kinda confused on that then. If you type /deaths in the chat box, it says how many times you‚Äôve actually ‚Äòdied‚Äô. 
---
Yeah, that wasn't season 7 my friend.
---
As long as we get elite specs I don't care. 
---
What prize? People are just saying thanks, and people like you piss me off. There are hundreds of employees that are working on this and sometimes the fuck ups are out of their hands. Thanks should always be given. Be decent. 
---
Don't be.
---
Try ESO if you havent already. 
---
Thank you.
---
Now this is the kind of story I can get behind, good on you anet, finally something good. Well done.
---
You're assuming that the those features are not the exact ones MikeZ just said would be included in non-expansion updates, though. If they're going to give me expansion features for free in LW or other updates, an expansion is going to have to be something truly massive to justify a $30-$70 price tag. 
---
Got a source for that?
---
The writers said it was intentional that they wanted you to feel as though you didn't get enough time with him, like a missed opportunity/friend. For me it worked. I was annoyed at first, but his story and that scene has stayed with me and hurt me more than any other. So i'd say from a writer's perspective it was a job well done. Also, it was his recordings that made me feel like i knew him, and i cared about him, so much more than Aurene. The scene from today didn't even make me feel much.  His anguish, questions, loneliness, anger, just made me wish i was there for him. 
---
Well, in Guild wars 1 you killed a lich too - with the power to resurrect, which was part of a prophecy ... ogden was around that time and i would be surprised if he didnt knew about glints prophecy back than, with the dwarfs being the old keepers of glints secrets and stuff.
---
But you could be right
---
That is the ancestral outfit.

A machine that can show you the eternal alchemy BY MANIPULATING LEY LINES, to a machine that can kill elder dragons BY MANIPULATING LEY LINES.
---
The only leap required was learning that dragons affect ley line energy and the weakness thing, which was again set up 3+ episodes in advance.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm really torn up about her death.
---
But the part that really broke my heart?
---
&gt; *"I'm not him."*
---
Granted, I have a special connection to that kind of sentiment, but ouch. Those were her first spoken words to us.
---
I want to hug her so badly.
---
Not a hitch since the update dropped. Only gripe of mine is that Skritt yelling Skritt Math all over the map lol
---
It was an amazing story, altho it felt rushed. Many noticed this aswell it seems and it's probably part of the reason we failed in the end.
---
I want Aurene to come back, I really like her (But I also like Majory and Kasmeer, bring them back &gt;:I ). But I also want to see what else can be brought into the story. Not to mention if we're getting a Canthan expansion or Gw3. Should Aurene really be in those? Would it make sense to not involve her in those if she's alive after/if Kralk falls?
---
I really want the next part to come out soon (But when it's done), to see what we're gonna do, because just as the Commander, I don't know.
---
Girl, it was camp. 
---
There was content? 
---
So much hate for fractal instabilities and so many wondering about balance patch.. why not just move instabilities from fractals to pvp and then everyone will be happy
---
Expansion level content doesn't mean that they will outright give us everything that was previously reserved for expansions.
---
yeah it was the same for me, although when the screen was extra dark it looked like a giant black bar on the top but not the bottom, maybe it was just hidden. I stood there for ages thinking it was still a cut scene before I knew i could move. 
---
She was killed as soon as she started absorbing powerful magic and becoming a rival to an Elder Dragon.
---
My gamer safe space is invaded by people commited on Deviant Sexual Identity IRL.
---
Kralk was swimming through the mists eating it though.
---
Anet killed Aurene or smtg, am I right ??? If so, that should not be allowed, this is totally unacceptable to hurt people's feeling in that way. It's kind of sadistic behavior from the game developpers &amp; story tellers. SADISTIC I tell you. (Make a cute pet in game &amp; then slaughter it. WTF)
---
Yeah, she even told us Aurene's love for us was almost painfully intense. Imagine feeling that stripped away.
---
ANet really bamboozled us. Everything was lining up perfectly, but it still wasn't enough. But then Aurene knew that would be the case.
---
Then, the entire plot starting from living story seasons 2 would become meaningless. Every single event around the character  and the lore build around her would just just shatter into nothingness.   
---
Heck, the "we can't kill an elder dragon anymore without a replacement " was the major plot that started the events of the latest expansion as well.   
---
If Aurene really dies, the entire gw2 story just fell apart.   
---
( also, if they really want to write her off, they just have to make her become an elder dragon after the victory after Kralkatorrik.  then, make her go to sleep. ) 
---
I know there has to be a solution...but I cracked up when I heard Taimi cry...
---
The moment I saw her hair and outfit I was like "...do they expect me to not know this is Gwen?"
---
Haha
---
Your argumentation is flawed. You understand that we don't really know what it means but you previously referred to it as evidence to back your point - which in turn was exactly my point. This post really does not tell us whether or not there will be another expansion.
---
For the second part:
---
ANet has been extremely careful and vague when talking about upcoming content ever since Mo became Game Director. This hasn't changed since Z has taken over. Additionally there is just no reason for them to state anything publicly and to essentially put pressure (to deliver) on themselves when there is nothing to gain (yet).
---
Did they even playtest it at all?
---
i can honestly say,that after finishing this cancer of the fractal,im not gona play it again. 100 cm is EASY in comparison to this. 10 veterans from each side every 10 sec,perma 8 condi,  20 stacks of confu and poison in  5 sec,all than on  10x20m with push mechanic every 2 sec as cherry on the top. fck this fractal.
---
Well, that depends entirely on the execution of bringing her back.
---
I, for one, assume she's coming back because A) we literally don't have any other options that we know of, and B) she's become a bit too much of a poster child for GW2. It's like how people *just know* some characters are gonna *have to* come back to life in Avengers 4.
---
That said, to keep her death from feeling empty, it's possible that we may need to spend some quality time hunting for a way to bring her back, wrestling with the reality of her death. Sometimes, time itself is a hard enough impact to be meaningful.
---
On the flip side, her resurrection may lead to far worse consequences that won't be solved until far later in the story. Trade one bad thing for another.
---
As long as it isn't just flippantly undone, her death can still be meaningful. We'll just have to see how it plays out.
---
I would disagree, I've worked with people who just \*aren't\* cut out for food service. In fact, most people aren't cut out for it. Like, you can train them for a year and they'll never be any better. When we talk about "skilled" labor I think it's disingenuous because what we mean is "educated labor." I would say the skills for food service are. In food service, you have to remember massive quantities of orders, know how to make like 40-some different recipes without hesitation. You have to have really solid dexterity, and you have to basically be able to brisk-walk for hours at a time.
---
Also, you have to deal with being constantly emotionally abused by customers and management. And sometimes sexually harassed by direct supervisors and the occasional patron especially if you're a woman; I see it happen all the time, and they don't want you to speak up about it because they know they'll lose their jobs if they say anything.
---
Management in Food service is generally poor across the board, and that's why a lot of chain restaurants are dying. Culturally we've been trained to disrespect food service workers, and use them as basically a joke of unsuccessful people. Management usually doesn't value their best workers, and the first thing they cut costs on is worker safety, wages, benefits (if there even are any) etc... Management loses their best workers to competitors, and then they hire subpar workers and they wonder why customers stop coming back, and they start failing food safety inspections. The competitors then repeat the cycle, and more restaurants close.
---
I totally agree with you! I'm so pissed! She's like my baby... 
---
That one happened to me as well, I ran towards him too early and got stuck.
---
I'm anxiously waiting for the Snargle comic about this. Dammit, the Commander is going to hang himself. 
---
Thanks, I'll edit it to make note of that. did you come across any rooms I did not include? I thought there were more than I did, but I was not sure.
---
We don't know about magic and how do magic creatures devour them. Kralkatorrik devour the magic in the air when Balthazar has died. I'm quite sure Aurene has something to do with the lich powers of Joko.
---
Ok, suit yourself. Your premise is equally flawed. "They didn't say we're NOT getting an expansion right after Season 5, so clearly we ARE" Checkmate, you, I guess.
---
This article literally says this episode is the conclusion to season 4.
---
Yay, beautiful Moria-esque dwarven ruins to explore, story quest that somehow managed to not enrage me at any point, what a nice update...
---
... then I got to the end.
---
I did NOT need this right after watching Made In Abyss.  Too much crying for today.
---
Four burns a row, through the fence on all of them, and it's not working for me.  No idea why.
---
The instance was ruined for me, I was too busy being frustrated at my allies pushing mobs out of the charging zones and invisible walls trapping me every 3 seconds.
---
This is exactly how I've been feeling about it! And it somewhat bothers me to see people actually hating this ending like this is exactly the most realistic ending possible! She fucking showed us she would die and with wishful thinking we thought we could just defeat the most powerful being even though we rushed through - and I even believed it because of the past with Zhaitan and Mordremoth that Anet was repeating it. 
---
Thanks for the surprise, this is what I want out of the story to feel more engaged with it. This is the first death in a while that felt meaningful and well placed.
---
&gt; Oh you want to run somewhere in Orr?  Here's some cripples and frost conditions and we'll sink you in the water etc etc etc.
---
I never realised how bad it was at Orr until I had to run a level 70 alt to Buried Archives jp without mounts for Wintersday tree node collection. Took a lot of blood, pain and sweat to reach the wp. Then had a kind soul escort me to the chest. Phew!
---
I mean, we literally got our quietly huge update 6 hours ago.
---
I'd say it's still plenty alive.
---
Everything about the scene is perfect. The voice actors, the atmosphere, the pacing... beyond immersive. I felt that shit in my soul.
---
I already reported another similar bug in the in game "report a bug" feature.
---
After using my special action hotkey on the second crystal I moved down and to the left to grab a dragonsblood spear before I was going to go to kralk's wound. But I was too fast and a bunch of rubble fell down on me when Kralk hit the ground. Luckily the npcs killed it (extremely slowly) and shifted the rubble a tiny amount and by simply spamming spacebar I pushed through it in the end.
---
Felt a bit silly for being punished when I just tried to be fast and efficient, but Anet jail was cozy enough atleast :)
---
wtf, if she comes back this episode will be so bad. I love this episode because it created a nice ending. It will be worthless if she just uses a waypoint or sth. 
---
BIRDS
---
Remember when Reddit said the MMORPG article was bullshit because it said there were Flame Legion in this story? Good times.
---
Inb4 we resurrect aurene but get Palawa Joko in our bond as a bonus.
---
They will resurrect her, the ending looks exactly like game of thrones season 7 ending.

*Jormag attacks.*

---
wym?
---
I always assumed that once she took on the role of elder dragon, we'd probably have to say goodbye to her or something.
---
An inkling?  We were literally shown this exact outcome in the last episode, remember?
---
It was when they previewed the second half of season4, around the anniversary time. I‚Äôll try to find a link. 
---
I'm sorry, but how the bloody hell was that ending a "surprising out-of-the-wazoo plot twist" when we were literally shown that exact outcome in the previous episode?  Anyone who went into that last instance actually thinking Kralkatorrik was going to die had their brains turned off.

It's something that will be a big boon for people who are hard of hearing, or have turned the game volume down for whatever reason. Simply coloring the text is not enough to help player discern who is speaking, whereas having the speaker's name allows for more clarity. This is one of the golden rules for subtitling.
---
I've killed that graveling so many times but no plate...
---
If you gain entrace to the Dwarven Rooms via the light of deldrimor plate, you get a 30 min buff and treasure hunt skill. You gain also access to one random of the dwarven rooms and at the end of that room, you get another plate that opens another room. IT seems you can only gain 3 new plates per day and then you end up in a room with a throne. The 5 regular rooms all have 2 hidden chests in them you can locate with your light of deldrimor skill and they have a chance to drop the serpentite jewels. The throne room has one hidden chest with 3 guaranteed drops of jewels.
---
It was fantastic - really immersed me in the scene.
---
Well done!
---
Probably super unpopular opinion but I feel anet backed themselves in  a corner here, because they either revert Aurene's death (which imho is the most likely outcome) and piss off the "death should mean something" side or they don't and then they have to pull a new method of dealing with the elder dragons plotline, either by pulling some new method outta nowhere or giving a kinda non-resolution/bad ending of "nothing we can do anymore" route to it.
---
And then ending in such a cliffhanger scene also means people will have a lot of time to let these expectations sit and pile up, so they get more committed to their own ideas of how the story should proceed, and with how divided the reactions seem to be so far, there will inevitably be a considerable amount of people disappointed no matter what path anet chooses with the story.
---
Could we maybe go back to the old scarf "lighting issue"? The new texture looks terrible.
---
Colors are all washed out and the material is WAY too shiny for what's supposed to be a cloth scarf.

Not everything has to look like it's made of greasy plastic.

Whew, that's a lot of stuff, but it seems fun nonetheless. I'll give it a shot then, thanks for the input!

try using your special action key it makes light that might reveal it, I think that might help reveal it? killing it in the story does nothing, you have to come back afterwards with the light of deldrimor.

So... mind dragon magic allows a dragon tu survive their own death by hitching a ride in a minion, and Aurene got quite a lot of mind and plant magic from Mordremoth's death.
---
Now. What's the closest we have to Aurene's minion at this moment?

Just-damn-incredible-episode!
---
Seriously, I never expected they would dare to follow this line... and they did! My jaw is still recovering after hitting the ground and almost yelling a damn "WTF?!?!?!"
---
Yeah, thats the thing that seems the most unlikely, unfortunately...
---
Aren't any. Just massive amounts of the map currency.
---
Just have the Ipos hands pummel things like floating hulk hands.
---
That's a good point! I was really curious what dragons would need with Ascension. Not to mention, Ascension as we know it is dependent on gods/celestial beings.
---
I noticed that too, it might be foreshadowing. 
---
we had this happen, it was pretty awkward when I fought at the last crystal alone while the instance owner struggled to find a way back from the start after he used /stuck
---
My respects 'cos this damn episode! WELL DONE!
---
Speaking of which, seeing Glint's body... few things in video games have made me feel so uneasy. That was *her.* She's been *there* this whole time.
---
And she was just utterly lifeless, barely recognizable. This whole episode was so sad.
---
Thanks for the guide! 
---
But the drops. Anything cool? 
---
My go-to leveling build for mesmer was scepter/sword + great sword with whatever new slot skills I had unlocked (manipulations first, imo)
---
     
---
I chose those weapons because they offered a lot of defence and I like that. scepter 2 and sword 4 are both blocks that generate clones if they block something. 
---
In the end you generally find everything requires gold. Doing your pvp and fractal dailies is generally a strong starting point, after that choose whatever content you like. Stop spending gold on silly alts and minis and you'll be loaded in no time. This game doesn't respect long game sessions anyway, so just put in a hour or two everyday and get out before you feel burnt out.
---
Given the long-time importance of Aurene in the story it's possible that this was even Peter Fries's idea
---
Maybe. But good guys winning all the time is boring. Like for example I would have loved if Joko wasn't defeated and remained an enemy but not our primary one. Like Magneto in X-Men.
---
Omg they killed Aurene! You bastards! 
---
Jokes aside, this left me jaw-dropping. I honestly don't think I can sleep tonight :( 
---
I just wish the skritt with a megaphone would shut up.
---
I got it on my 3rd chest today!!!! 
---
Oh, that's me! Domi scepter mirage!!
---
Its the deldrimor plate halves, 1 for each meta. Got both on my 1st kills. 
---
&gt; we used everything on Kralk just for Aurene to die...  
---
Well, you know what, that's the way the cookie crumbles sometimes. Sometimes you work really hard and get really close to someone, and then you lose them in an instant. Everything you worked months, or years for can go to complete shit in the blink of an eye. That's not bad writing, really, that's just a reality of life.
---
Moral of the story, keep your loved ones close because you never know if some shit might happen.
---
Log in every now and then, kill a world boss, buy some gems and log of. Thats how gw2 is ment to be played. 
---
I don't think anyone knows yet what the ascended ones will need.
---
The misconception CMs are important because they give repeatable content to do to a very small subset of players has always been there. This comes from a person that did them for over a year **daily** with a group that had leaderboard presence. 
---
I would be much more enticed to do fractals with simple additions like skinless fractal legendary armor and trinkets or a different color for Ad Infinitum, maybe even more levels of account bound AR.
---
I don't think she even hatched until LVS3
---
Well I mostly care about Elite specs, which so far seem to come in expansions. if they manage to release elite specs in LW then I'm not gonna really care if we're gonna get expansions or LW
---
/stuck ?
---
After six years I suddenly don't feel like playing anymore. Such a feelbad gutpunch would have been very ok as part of an expansion storyline, but for a 3+ month long cliffhanger it just seems cheap and pandering to the Game of Throne masochist fans.
---
Ah well, at least it saves me the gems I had planned on getting for the gecko while it was available.
---
And NO, this is NOT good storytelling no matter what your casual fanboys are saying. Six years of daily logins. No more.

&gt; Bug Fixes:
---
&gt;* Fixed an issue in which the text for the Chasing Tales achievements referenced the wrong objectives.
---
&gt;* Reduced the crafting material costs for the Diviner's Intricate Gossamer Insignia and Diviner's Orichalcum-Imbued Inscription.
---
&gt;* Fixed an issue in which the Jahai Bluffs option in the Season 4 Portal Tome took players to Thunderhead Peaks.
---
&gt;* Fixed an issue that made the home instance node for Thunderhead Peaks unavailable for purchase.
---
Shoipd be removed. Period.
---
Is this 100% sure that an Anet employe has to be in the party? Maybe is something else?
---
I think it's a fun change. Start running for your money
---
Honestly had 0 problem on T4 with a pug fractal group. Obviously wiped a few times but fractal was pretty easy.
---
It is very different to do it in WvW were 150 people have access to it each time they show up in WvW, whilst in fractals there are 4 people.
---
Are you saying the only way we win against Kralk and the other dragons is if Aurene sacrifices herself but Glint chose not to tell the PC as they'd probably freak out or some shiz?
---
Fuck me man, I mean they laid it bare last episode but damn... it's a bit of a gut punch :(
---
Basically any fractal with jumping puzzle elements or precise combat movement will be horrible. Ocean and Chaos for instance will not fare any better.
---
That's the first thing I thought at the end of the episode. Time for her lich powers to kick in. 
---
This better have a huuuuge fucking payoff next episode/expansion. It made me actually angry to see her die like that.
---
Nerfs Chronos.
---
Sees less Chronos. Makes Slippery Slope.
---
Praise Joko!  
---
But seriously, I do hope that's what happens. Though, if it's so easy to predict, it almost never plays out that way. If it did, that would be lazy/bad storywriting, after all. 
---
500 years later all dragons will be dead and instead there will be 6 stones that possess the power of the dragons.
---
Hey Anet hire me already!
---
I am also willing to bet everything that she will come back. There is some evidence for it, too, but mostly, from how the story has been told up to now, I can feel it. She will be back. 
---
Game disconnects for me after the final boss cutscene so I can't complete this episode...
---
Bye, see you next week. 
---
Great...
---
Already got the stuff for Dragonblood Greatsword and crafted it. I would now be able to craft 2 weapons. 
---
Kinda pissed
---
I know who I'll be dancing on in the future. /s
---
The food industry is a bad example. It's a shit job, nobody is paid well, and a large majority of customers think they're better people than the workers for working there. If you want to hold fast food workers as the standard for employee treatment, that's pretty sad.
---
I got a hard crash-to-desktop during the Thunder-whatchamacallit-Keep event, but otherwise, not too bad.
---
Kralkatorrik has much more Mordremoth magic than Aurene and also much more capable of absorbing magic than Aurene imo. Cause a couple thousand years old elder dragon vs a newborn scion right. So i don't think Aurene can mindtrick people and an elder dragon which has the power of two other elder dragons and a god. But from my perspective no matter how hard Glint's army hit Kralk and weaken him, fighting aganist an elder dragon shouldn't be this easy. It's either Anet underestimating the "elder dragon" thing or overestimating the commander and it's crew but Aurene already stopped the combined attack of 3 elder dragons and a god so she can maybe trick a weakened elder dragon anyways idk. It's a total mess for Anet in my perspective.
---
Kralk left to the mists to rest because he was badly damaged and used his last power to give a shot to commander.
---
We know crystal dragon's only weakness is it's own blood from Balthazar and we know Kralk had a vision of the world without him and Aurene probably absorbed Joko's lich powers so we will definitely see Aurene for the next episode idk how. I bet my money on Joko's lich powers tho.
---
Your very welcome! I really loved seeing animations like this since it helps set the feel of the ending. Time well spent.
---
I don't get why Kralk didn't just destroyed everything the second he stuck his head in.
---
Cut in half? No. Side stories or a small bit of dialogue like the Caithe interaction when Roller Beetle Racing released? Maybe.
---
Lunar New Year next, but it's unlikely it will involve any LWS4 story elements.
---
Yeah, I had already crafted one, too. Ah, well.
---
Well anything sounds like a backhanded complement when you phrase it as a backhanded complement.
---
Does anyone know where the Diviner's gossamer insignia is sold? The priory scholar volatile magic collector seems to only sell the orichalcum inscription. 
---
GW2 will always have the dragon storyline. Uncharted territories will come inbetween but don't expect them to fully resolve the Elder Dragon arc anytime soon... 
---
Hearing the LIIIIGHT OF DelDRIMOR!!! across the map sure is something.
---
This very much, I do believe that Aurene will be back but not next episode or even soon - for now I think she will be mentioned but out of the story.  
---
As it was made a point of that Joko was now gone and the fact that it was even a part of instructions from Glint herself point towards the writers going out of their way to make sure if/when she comes back that it's legit and wouldn't just be an ass pull, I think they need to let this sit with the PC and the actual players themselves though, bringing her back next episode would just destroy the dramatic impact at the end of this episode and while earned from a writing perspective would come off rather exploitative and cheap.
---
But then I could be totally wrong, who knows! Either way this was by far one of their best episodes to date, just outstanding frankly and if we can expect this from Season Five then holy hell are we in for a good year.
---
I hope there'll be a great comic about this moment someday.
---
&gt; Did she not literally just eat King Palawa Joko, the immortal lich?
---
Joko can still be corrupted. He just can't be stabbed to death.
---
The eyepatch was foretold, we just followed wrong vision. https://youtu.be/ZhENkjaZmPY
---
Because complaining about a problem they know about and are actively working on fixing doesn't help shit, it only worsens the relationship between the player base and the developers.
---
nnneeaoowww
---
Oh yeah, ESO, where you get to pay a subscription to get material storage.
---
Obviously something in the update touched something that touches the raids. Probably why they didn't see the bug coming.
---
Male Norn Mcree was best waifu as per usual.
---
Quit (or restart earlier LS) and restart?
---
Well, it is Branded "Mass", like "biomass".
---
Anet,  we still need a toggle for particle effects.   I  love that you want to give all the details but particle effects aren't for everyone.   
---
Tried quit and restart this chapter but didn‚Äôt work. Not sure how earlier LS would affect the current one 
---
I feel like she had to die. Her worst fear was turning into a branded, maybe it was better for her to die then to become corrupt. 
---
Glint spoke with her alone and told us it was something only dragons can understand and maybe showed her how she could help from the mists if if she‚Äôs dead and not branded, and maybe that‚Äôs where Kralk is probably heading back to recover. Then when she has the connection with Caithe she tells us that her love for us is so great its almost painful, because she‚Äôs gonna have to sacrifice herself to be the final piece for us to stop Kralk.
---
Yes I think Joko‚Äôs Absorption by Aurene is going to play a huge part in this. However that last image of her was quite gruesome‚Ä¶ I keep flip-flopping as to whether I think she will return or not.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/793355/#Comment_793355
---
If that was the case then why was Caithe so definitive that she was gone, Joko resurrected himself moments after his defeat.
---
Aurene consumed Joko's magic, that doesn't necessarily give her his powers - Joko isn't a dragon like Zhaitan. 
---
Says who? How do you know this?
---
Rather than having new fractals have CMs I would like to see older ones receive them. Imagine a CM on Solid ocean where instead of killing adds/throwing trash they add a unique boss battle with mechanics taken from the fractal. I would like to see more of that then want a CM with every new fractal.
---
Don‚Äôt have access to the game now, is Diviner‚Äôs stat same as pvp?
---
SHIT, I recognized it was someone I knew but literally brain farted on who exactly :I
---
Thank goodness they're really uninspired looking (including the upgrade) and I can save my Laurels for other things still.
---
&gt; as PoF was rushed
---
No, not really. They delivered exactly what they wanted in the time frame they planned and they did good (especially on the story). HoT was rushed (hence a lot of cut content), Kourna was rushed (and unfinished). PoF wasn't rushed in any way.
---
I've kept my [Token of Affection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Token_of_Affection) on my shared items bar ever since I got it. To say I'm a little gutted by all this is an understatement.
---
And to think, just this morning, we were joking about how if Aurene dies, we'd riot.
---
My Google news feed showed this with a non-censored image. Thanks.
---
PoF meta events were rushed.
---
&gt; WvW is terrible. *on specific servers*
---
You really should say why WvW is terrible. Depending on the server you're on its either really fun and engaging or its miserable because of lack of population.
---
GW3 might be a mobile game. And Battle Royale.
---
I got 3 from doing the dwarven treasure rooms in the catacombs. To get in, do the metas to find the top and bottom pieces of the plate (thunderhead keep meta and oil meta), then talk to the dwarf in the catacombs. Should be obvious what to do from that point on. Just remember to use your special action key to find hidden chests...
---
I'm guessing that's BS and they just never tested it like everything else they throw in the game. Just let the players test it, it's easier that way.
---
They weren't the focus.
---
Maybe they'll turn GW1 into a mobile game.
---
They were rushed.
---
I don't know how you guys are so lucky. The best thing I've gotten from chests are black lion tickets. I just opened 10 chests for this and nothing but teleports. I'll cut my losses there.
---

Sorry, 'get rid' is more like an Aussie slang for 'find something useful for' :)
---
True they aren't in the way, which is why they generally continue to build up.
---
lol the Official Forums aka Anet's "happy safe space echo chamber"
---
Makes sense, especially if you're a Charr or Norn.
---
The truth is 'trolling'? Alright then
---
They had some good dialog, made me really sad for them. Their wild hunts were gone and replaced by Joko's voice. 
---
R/warframe is leaking. Back to the void with you!
---
"excuse me, what the fuck"
---
- Glint
---
Depends on the undeath. In the case of the Awakened/Free Awakened, it is (at least potentially) pretty close to resurrection.
---
I had no clue this was a thing... Guess I know what I'm buying next.
---
Sunspear: "May Balthazar strengthen you."
---
Commander: "..."
---
Sunspear: "...Oh, shit. I'm sorry man, it just slipped out. I mean... Shit. Like, just, good luck man."
---
Some people aren't happy with the story.  I've got some issues with the map requiring drops from two different metas to complete, but (most of) those issues evaporated when I noticed that the parts can be bought off the trading post.  Will be a nice revenue source for folks for a couple of days.
---
And from what I've read it looks like at least one of the new fractal instabilities would benefit from further fine-tuning.
---
I'm gonna go against the flow here and say I didn't like it all that much. The death was clearly for shock value given the way she's posed and the cut to black. Either she comes back next episode, which makes the scene nothing but cheap shock with no consequences, or she stays dead and the three year story arc of raising her to become an elder dragon replacement is even more worthless than the casino planet in The Last Jedi.
---
But you're just making up numbers. 30 people spending $5 makes more than 1 person spending $100.
---
did both metas 2x aswell as the room once. no drops. am i cursed?
---
The ole Ginyu switcheroo. 
---
Can I just ask, why is it that them killing off characters means you want to avoid the story? If you care enough about said characters for it to have that effect then by all means you'd want to stick with writers who can get you invested right? Not abandon the story because it doesn't go the way you feel like it should, especially as you actually did feel strongly at the end.
---
If a story can make you feel bad about a character dying like that, it shows that you were invested and that's likely to do with good writing or at least you subjectively enjoy their writing - not all stories should be triumphs or victories, it gets stale and boring even if it is what we want at the end of the day.
---
I'll take the gut punch I received tonight over any other ending frankly, I was led by the nose from start to finish believing there was no way I could fail even if all the odds were stacked against me and when that HoT soundtrack flared up in the background and I was walking past all the soldiers gearing up, I thought to myself, "Back to war" with a smirk on my face. The entire design of that last instance is just wonderful at getting players pumped up sufficiently so they can be ripped down, doubly so if you've followed the story from day one.
---
Anyway sorry for the rant, just don't be discouraged because things didn't go your way this time, Kralk will get what's coming to him.
---
I'm glad this was a thing, honestly - the last two episodes both had showstoppers that required hotfixes to get the quest (that leads you to the new map, in both cases) playable.  This one just works!
---
The problem with fractals is they don't expand the variety of content. Everything is just the same 3 dailies with the same rewards, not even unique skins.
---
Quitting tends to save your progress; starting a different chapter will wipe that progress in favor of the new one. Then starting the original chapter should be from 0, not from previous progress.
---
Worth a shot, anyway.
---
Yes
---
Main stats Power/Concentration, minors are precision/ferocity
---
Worked for LWS1 and LWS2, I guess
---
MY BABY IS GOING TO TELEPORT TO FRIEND ANY SECOND NOW YOU JUST SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
---
I think we wrap up this expansion in the mists in the next episode.
---
&gt; vorene
---
well, she did vore up joko's magic
---
Is there going to be a teleporting scroll sort of thing in this new map?
---
I am thinking maybe I can do the mission in another character, and then teleport my main into it... do you think that‚Äôs doable?
---
My question: How do you even market living world to consumers? Someone who doesn't play GW2 has no reason to be hyped.
---
Nice Thanks. Can‚Äôt wait to go home and try
---
I haven't managed the mapbreaking route yet because there's about a million invisible walls in this map, it's crazy. I've probably spent more time trying to cheese my way in than it'd've taken to do it legit because, well, I'm stubborn.
---
Well if you don't want to do the stuff like skins or achievements I'm not sure what you expected. This happens to me with every game Iv'e every played. You either play all the content or you run out of stuff to do.  No company can produce content faster than I can consume it.
---
Why would a Weaponsmith sell an armor insignia (recipe)?  Makes no sense.
---
Of course I don't have the numbers, but it's the logical thing for a business to do.
---
They wouldn't lock items behind predatory gamble-boxes if they weren't more profitable than selling them up front for cheaper.
---
They fucked this up with plague bringer as well. They don't think about any of this stuff before hand and regularly take several months to get it as options where it needs to be. They aught to just do a hard pass on stat selection items. 
---
There is a scroll (there's one for each LS 3/4 map, as well as a LS3 &amp; LS4 binder), and the latest patch fixed it so it will actually send you to the right map (instead of Jahai Bluffs).
---
I keep seeing all the spoilers and being like "yeah, for episode *4*".
---
Also, in case anyone was wondering - there's a small cooldown on the draw weapon effect. You won't be able to spam it with hide/unhide like other legendaries :&lt;
---
Or the ability to earn a mistlock sanctuary pass
---
"it's just a chaos bow with extra effects!"
---
May I present to you: Ray of Justice in bow form.
---
I‚Äôm still not convinced. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll see Aurene again. 
---
If I had to put my money on it, they are making XPac 3 but it's nowhere near ready to announce and that it was always planned to have two seasons of living world before the next XPac. This is them not committing as it'd drive attention to a new expansion but not denying to make people go off the rails when it isn't true.
---
They probably just want people to focus on living world while they keep work behind the scenes on the next expansion.
---
The female human voice actor was great too with the final "I don't know." 
---
The tone basically said "well, let's just lay down and die."
---
Flashback to just moments before when the dredge leader said "if you fail, we all die, and the spirit of revolution dies with us". Ouch. Feels like foreshadowing.
---
Thanks
---
Could also Buy Gems &gt; convert to Gold &gt; Buy off TP
---
on the real though imagine if the rest of the gods werent absolute betas like think if they had balthazars determination but with a but more reason, this all would be so much easier 
---
I believe **all** generation 2 legendaries are account bound. So you cannot buy the legendary on the TP. 
---
Lol, that reminds me of the Balthazar fight when my Elementalist was actually calling on the power of Balthazar to fuel her fire magic to burn Balthazar.
---
"Wait, what?!?"
---
Why did the devs create a new Aurene sword for Caithe if she won't be using it long term? 
---
I love that not only did we know we'd get destroyed because of vision. But Glint decided that our trial to see if we could pull if off was us fighting a few regular branded, some of which were veterans, and after we managed to do that she was like ''aight you looked solid on those veterans, you're ready to fight the elder dragon now''.
---
Did something major change in the story? Thought undeadSylvari were not possible.? Mini Trahearne looks a bit confused in that pic too.
---
wow. I like ur thinking. 
---
&gt;Only if I get to kick the pups as well as throw them... *into a pool of hungry krait.*
---
Fixed that for you! :D
---
Norton keeping pinging and removing it, for me. Don't like that. What a shame.
---
Well damn you would be correct. Gen 1 is account bound on use though, while Gen 2 is on acquire
---
Right. That‚Äôs what I meant, words are hard though lol
---
reminded me of Destiny 2 lmao 
---
The real answer; don't do condi dps.
---
so how did we kill him again?
---
We have the mists, so "bringing them back" is built into the game's canon. And Balthazar insinuated that with Grenth gone dead spirits can just walk out of the mists/domain of the lost.
---
I think it's almost certain she's gonna come back in some capacity, even if it's just fighting Kralkatorrik in the mists alongside Glint. But as a ghost, would she still have the crystal resonance required to kill him? Or maybe we don't need her anymore, given that Caithe is her minion and we've bonded with her enough to use her crystal resonance to destroy brand.
---
The dragons winning would most certainly mean the end of the Guild Wars franchise. With Balthazar's god magic, Kralkatorrik's mist traveling means he can feast on other worlds too, till not even the gods could stop him. He probably rivals them in power even now.
---
I hope so, Aurene is mah girl!  
---
Can we get a version of it on kazoo?
---
You felt like unsheathing or sheathing your axe?
---
I assume that they could not be corrupted by Zhaitan's death magic only because they were (secretly) creations of Mordremoth and dragons cannot corrupt other dragon minions. 
---
It's not a waste of time at all, the episode shows the PC's hubris and brashness when it comes to actually dealing with all these problems, usually we scrapiley make a plan and it works out for us but this time it didn't and it just so happened to be a rather dire time to lose.
---
I ask you though, how do you prepare for your Dragon to die? What possible back-up plan was there other then simply not fighting Kralky at all yet (I'll bring you back to the first point, our characters bull rushing attitude) also remembering how little of a choice that was due to the instability of Tyria and The Mists at this point. 
---
I have a feeling Season Five is going to be along the lines of what you're asking for actually, that is to say, a long build up of both morale and plans for the PC and allied forces after what has happened - leading into a final battle with Kralk and/or the introduction of the Deep Sea Dragon on the scene, I'd imagine we'll see the Deep Sea Dragon deal the final blow to Kralk possibly with Aurene absorbing some of that magic in some fashion but obviously that's heavy ass speculation with little to back it up at all.
---
Oh and our weapons were not perfectly prepped at all, the Dragons Blood spears were much weaker than the previous one and are quite literally the only thing that would of been useful against Kralk and our plan was hastily put together.
---
If I were to introduce someone to the episode I would likely say: "The rift between Tyria and The Mists is ever-weakening and forces us to act quickly against Kralkatorrik, we hastily hatch a plan to trap and kill the Crystal Dragon which while effective could cost us everything if we fail."
---
Caithe was so definitive because she lost those new crystal like bonds with Aurene and turned back to her normal slyvari form.
---
We don't know how magic works in this universe so you can't say that Joko is not a dragon so he didn't give his powers to her. A simple mortal Kormir absorbed all the magic from a godlike being from the mists and became a goddes. Necromancy and being a lich is a whole new and more complicated story so we don't know what happens of a dragon consumes a lich's powers.
---
Maybe because Aurene already started the process of reabsorbing that magic/soul/whatever from Caithe to begin the process of rezzing herself?
---
This was just a shock-factor penultimate episode. I've seen enough of them to know why they wrote the way they wrote. But seriously, jesus christ they need to stop being so murder happy with their writing. It has like 0 impact now. They fetishize sadness worse than Steven Universe.  Maybe get some fresh perspective on the writing staff.
---
The ole rift device!
---
i mean when they are not usually though. I can't beat kralk though every time i get to the end of the fight it boots me to charcter select ive dont it four times not i refuse to do it again until its fixed.
---
What as the big mistake, out of interest?
---
I love this glider! Didn't think I would ever actually get it since it's BLC, but I got from my weekly key run first chest!
---
Im getting this too, tried 3 times now and same result each time
---
That's fantastic! I want to get Shattered too, might have to buy a few and see!
---
sucks thats happening but im kinda glad it wasn't just happening to me. I thought i was the only one i messaged people on my friends list ans guild chat and nobody else had this issue.
---
what am I looking at
---
They aren't particularly obnoxious and they fit the theme, I think you might be overreacting
---
I wouldn't really say Kralkatorrik had no change.  We grievously wounded him, not to mention he is now minus one eye and the right side of his head.
---
Ok I'm not gonna use the word "easy" because it really depends on the person and the classes they are using.
---
Most of the time however, people who wants to power level just go on full power.
---
What I mean by this is, you find a veteran partner who you can meet most of the time. Best if guildie so you can trust.
---
And help you with some crafting that way you don't have to go through the beast of learning crafting which can be overwhelming for a new player.
---
Here's the list of things you can ask from the veteran and your job is to grind gold along the way to pay for it.

1. Level 0-10 magic blue named: ask them to craft a "mighty" level 0 gear for armors and weapons (that have weapon skills scaling with power and not conditions - DoT). You will buy minor runes (6 different once with primary power +10 stats to slot on each pieces. E.g centaur, fire, brawler etc) and minor sigils (swiftness and bloodlust). Single handed weapon can only slot 1 sigil. Dual hand obv 2.
---
2. Skip level 15 gear, get level 20 masterwork green named: same story, these items will also have the name "mighty" in front of the item.
---
3. Level 35 rare yellow named: find the word "strong" for armors and weapons. Don't slot major runes and sigils yet but havem in your inventory until you reach level 38. If you slot them earlier on without having reached the level, YOU WONT BE ABLE TO EQUIP THEM.
---
4. Level 50 rare yellow named: same as level 35 will have the "strong" in front of gear name. Use major runes and sigils same story as the previous gears.
---
5. Level 65 rare yellow named: is the introduction of 3 stat combo gear, look for the name "berserker's" this time round, you will slot 6 superior runes of the scholar (level requirement is 60). You will pretty much wear this until you are level 80.
---
6. On your journey from 65 to 80, you will encounter dungeons! Ok, the first dungeon unlocks at level 35 called the ascalonian catacombs, you may grind all 3 paths (1 path per daily reset) to trade the dungeon tokens for level 80 exotic gold named "soldier's". You will grind enough tokens to slowly trade out all your 6 pieces of 65 rares to 80 exotics. Sadly you can't wear these yet until you've reached level 80, but it will sit in your inventory for later use.
---
7. Once you reach 80, you will wear the level 80 exotic gold named soldier's gear (6 armor pieces and w/e weapons youre using) and go to harder dungeons such as Citadel of Flames, Crucible of Eternity, Arah where you will able to obtain "Berserker's" stat gear. Once you've made the change and you have a full exotic Berserker's set. You can slot them to superior runes of the scholar. Sigils will be "Force" and "Air".
---
8. Congratulations you are level 80 and now somewhat prepped for end game. With your daily logins, you will encounter a currency called Laurels. You will use 20 of these + some badges of honor from WvW to get the ascended pink named amulet. Your guild will run guild missions and you use the commendations to buy 2 ascended pink named accessories. Lastly, you will do end game dungeon called the "Fractals of the Mist (FoTM for short)" where you will slowly but surely grind the daily pristine relics for 2 ascended pink named rings. Note that all your first ascended pink named trinkets should be of Berserkers stats, you can manually check them.
---
9. Now to wrap it up, you are actually ready for raids already if you are a warrior, ele, mesmer, engineer, guardian as long as you have the respective elite specialization unlocked. Watch raid videos and website guids (snowcrows, qty etc) to learn the encounter. With the raid loot, you will be able to buy yourself fully ascended armors and weapons OR you can also take up the challenge of maxing your crafting disciplines and craft the ascended armor yourself.
---
Sorry for making it this long, but I hope this was informative
---
Okay, I know this is probably super frustrating and all, but... 
---
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to do this myself. For the bragging rights alone. 
---
The green room (treasure with a throne and 2 VISIBLE chests has one invisible one you have to reveal with the special action key. The invisible chest I believe is a guaranteed 3 serpentite.
---
Caithe getting this magical bond with Aurene in order to give her the ability to say 4 sentences and then be sad when Aurene died. It just shits on everything that the commander has been working with this whole time.  The fact that they kick you right out of the instance the second the commander gives his final words just pissed me off more.  Never, more than anything, have i wanted them to kill Caithe.  Instead they just keep on murdering all the cool characters. 
---
Hire some extra writers Anet. You need some fresh perspective. Most people could see the outcome of this from orbit.
---
Similarly, human male conveyed "well, I'm helpless now. Death awaits" in his last sentence
---
It's just ... Depressing
---
The last time I played GW2 was years ago, and there have been a couple of times I've tried logging back into it, but after running around for 5 minutes, I'm just so lost and I have no idea what to do. 
---
Back when I used to play it, I used to know everything about the game but I feel like so much has changed that I'm overwhelmed with the sheer amount of changes and no clue where to go.
---
How can I avoid this? I have 4 LVL 80 characters I believe (if that was the level cap back then). 
---
You felt like particle effects? :o
---
[Event]!!!
---
I remember that, I personally kind of liked it. I'd personally rather have large sweeping balance changes similar to some moba-style games where they completely shift the meta on a regular basis
---
Or maybe he's more likely after learning it from Snaff.
---
As gawd as my witness, that dragon is broken in half!
---
That too.
---
My Norn needs this in his life.
---
Suure i'm sad, but still very salty about &gt;!Blish's death and how they brushed over it!&lt;
---
But her flowers dissolved at the end?
---
Didn't they say something about the resonance frequency thing being able to reshape crystal?
---
Tiamis next
---
This. People need to remember this 
---
I've never understood the idea that just because something happens to a character (like a death) that previous plot lines involving that character are suddenly irrelevant. The game isn't Aurene Wars. 
---
But but but imagine if they had it in Uncategorised or Cliffside... how you gonna jump those small platforms?
---
:'(
---
They're trash even with stability. 
---
This is so beautiful. I love simple and elegant designs. I'm not a fan of most of their maces but this one really does it for me.
---
Brazil
---
I'm thinking that the reason the 3rd expansion is taking longer is because they've learned a ton since releasing two of them. They have a good idea where each failed and each succeeded. I'm really hoping whatever it may be, it'll blast us into outer space. 
---
I'm definitely going to reserve any judgement (as much as I can..) until season 5 is out and we have an idea where the story will take us.
---
No need to sound any alarms yet.
---
Ok hear me out. What the hell did they say about the Domain of the lost in the story? something like kralk was there? what if Aurene ended up there. ". It is where those who died too traumatic a death and forgot themselves go" What if we have to go back there save Aurene in the mists then do a triple dragon gang bang in the mists glint vlast and aurene fighting kralk in the mists. maybe aurene had to die to be able to use the combined might of the glint family to destroy kralk in the mists. does anyone know what happens if we kill a dragon in the mists? one triple powered up? tryia will probably not be destroyed will all the magic be transferred into the mists instead of into a planet destroying bomb. 
---
they should add small stories between living world episodes, so theres less drought between em and more world building.
---
Super good episode but damn, I exited the game and went to bed and fell asleep super sad. My body felt heavy getting out of my chair, my heart had been hammering for a while from the rush. 
---
Tempest + Condi Berserker is fun
---
Just have the tempest spam as many fire auras as possible (which also provides boons and/or heals) to the Berserker and have him detonate them with King of Fires.
---
:(

Oh my goodness, hallelujah.

triple dragon showdown in the mists. kralk vs glint vlast and aurene. Lets GOO! Then spend next season dealing with whatever the hell is created when we kill a dragon inside the mists. or each mists dragon will absorb a single dragons powers and thats all wrapped up. whats next?
---
If they don't patch this quickly, this will become a meme. It'll be the next [WOO, SHINY!](https://youtu.be/-p1JXW8CBnU) (ok maybe not that bad, but still)
---
I think it‚Äôs important to create content that isn‚Äôt unnecessarily tedious. Some of the fights in recent content have just been really annoying. 
---
this makes me like it sooo much more
---
And rightfully so.  Few hours after launch and they nerfed the cost.  That's a pretty bad luck whether they want to accept it or not.  
---
Agree with most of this and adding that what pisses me off the most is losing everything in a cutscene. Literally, rocks fell and Aurene died. Feels like the shitty final boss preview in an RPG where even if you win, you just lose because it has to happen to make the plot shuffle along.
---
she had to die for a triple dragon showdown. they need glint vlasts and aurene's power to truely be able to take out kralk in the mists once and for all. then each grabs one of the 3 dead dragons powers. seems like its all lined up. this is my theroy.
---
How much of a pathetic lowlife do you have to be, to come onto the forum after months of not playing, only to shit on the game? No one wants you here, so why not just leave and find a game you enjoy? Might find something better to do with your time then wasting it on a "trash game" by your standards. 
---
I'd absolutely love smaller, toned down, less epic stories. I personally can only take this much story and scale "powercreep" before getting tired of it. Mind you, quality has been amazing since PoF, only improving and amazing us with each LS4 episode, but it's already on the brink of getting "too grand" for my taste.
---
&gt; Obv She is not dead. She is afterall the savior of the world and Glint foresaw that. The next ep is going to involve a lot of mists action, possibily glint and possibily , maybe, I hope so, a re-enact of glint's cleansing. This was done in the desert right? So we might get back there.
---
Could also be a "Jesus" move, in that perhaps the sacrifice was required, but it somehow kickstarts whatever is needed.
---
I mean that they have to be able to handle the client for both PC and Mac computers.
---
I agree here. I feel like it's been blown to such proportions that I can't even imagine myself in the commander's position, which is something I enjoy doing a lot to immerse in the story.
---
I guess that's possible, but it'd be pretty wild for the three signs to be A) events that distant and unrelated, and B listed in the order they were (egg hatch 3 years ago, lich died 250 years ago, sand glowed today)
---
Water erodes. 
---
I mean.... she had a point 
---
buuuttt nooo, don't trust the teenager @&gt;@ 
---
Everything was amazing but come on, Aurene has to come back in some shape or form! There's no way this is the last of her. Also, I'd LOVE to have Caithe's crystal flower as a backpiece or something. That effect is so cool.
---
Maybe I messed up entering it and didn't notice, but /stuck didn't help me at all.  I was stuck somewhere else though.  After using the third crystal on Kralk, I was griffon-ing down to the final showdown with Kralk and ended up stuck in the wall.
---
Triple dragon showdown epi 6. Glint vlast aurene in the mists vs kralk. Kralk dies each mist dragon absorbs the full powers of one of the dead elder dragons. Thats the major points of my theroy.
---
Yikes, can't wait...
---
Nah, he tried ad hominem response. Really shows you the state of fanboys.
---
[My opinion on the ending.](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/793818/#Comment_793818) Which is to say, yeah, it's a psych move.

Final Destination
---
Honestly I would expected her to just hijack Caithe instead, similar to how Mordi planned to do with Trahearne.
---
Plus you get a bonus with the line "she's gone" referring to Caithe and not Aurene.
---
Blame the horrible industry standards.
---
^ this guy right here got it.
---
Try switching to a busier server. I've been playing dungeons for the last few weeks and there's always somebody
---
Season 5 final boss is branded Aurene, you heard it here first.
---
A bit of a callback to "your worst fear" from the core story, and what is the point of a seer who's plans don't run to the win.
---
The slight delay outside the usual launch window had me worrying a little, but then the patch dropped without a single crash, connection error or even a slightest bug that I could notice. Very smooth Anet, congratulations and thank you for the great launch.
---
The patch itself wasn't bad either. I've never cared for the story all that much until this season, and the maps have much more detail  and content than their season 3 counterparts. I'd have wished a little more open space for this one though, the map seems very linear overall. But that's a matter of opinion, I guess.
---
Worth noting that while renegade has a slower ramp-up, its sustained dps in long fights is much higher than firebrand‚Äôs. As a result, condi renegade is less effective in open world/fractals, but incredibly strong on raid bosses with long sustained fights.
---
On the other hand, even though condi classes aren‚Äôt usually taken in fractals, firebrand‚Äôs ramp-up is super fast, plus it has some cooldowns reset by kills, so it‚Äôs viable (even if technically not optimal) in high-level fractals. Any fractal group would also really appreciate all the quickness that firebrand generates.
---
I came to two conclusions, while everyone else just went to "she's immortal she ate Joko's magic". This was one of the two. However, Caithe states that she no longer hears Aurene's voice. Her connection to Aurene died. So wherever Aurene's mind went to, if that's what happened, it did not go in Caithe.
---
The other conclusion was that, when Glint talked to Aurene in private about the true nature of Ascension, it was revealed that Aurene would need to die. When Aurene was next seen, her model changed ever-so-slightly, having a blue glow between/beneath her scales, and Aurene was no longer afraid of death.
---
Basically, while we were told Kralkatorrik fears a world of peace without him, Aurene was told she needed to die (or "die" if the Mind Swap theory is right) to win.
---
It seems they did this a lot this episode... Was it intentional?
---
They're not time traveling rifts. You cannot change the past. They're echoes of what has happened.
---
I think someone have a crush.
---
How do I get mastery points without having to do the story?
---
This is probably an old question, but I need to get a bunch of points quick and I find the story not very engaging. Is there a normal way yo pick up points? 
---
My only question is where the hell is Vlast in all this? He better be not ignoring his mother's phone calls!
---
Vlast seems like the kind of kids who spends his afterlife PvPing in the Hall of Heroes while his mother fights an Elder Dragon. That's the thanks for raising him. What a douche.
---
Can't believe you screenshotted that scene. Heart wrenching. 
---
No kidding, now Im considering getting it for my "holy" themed DH, and Kudzu for my sylvary nature themed ranger
---
Dr Strange: "It was the only way"
---
I thought the story was boring and unengaging as always 
---
How do you get to the blue plate in the new map? I've done everything up until the green plate
---
Renegade has a slower ramp-up time than firebrand but much higher damage potential (I think it overtakes most other condi builds after around 25 seconds?). And while renegade can generate self-might and alacrity, firebrand can give itself a decent uptime on quickness with just a few trait changes.
---
I would say that for open world, firebrand is slightly ahead; for raids, Renegade is better; for fractals, firebrand (though you shouldn't really run condi dps in fractals).
---
incorrect. merely running them over in wvw is just as valid as killing one in pvp.
---
That's the thing though, Guild Wars (the series) was often bittersweet in its resolutions, be it by episode or chapter od expanson, but this time it's not even bittersweet. We gained nothing, threw away so much with nothing in exchange. And while I know this isn't the last episode od the season, and I'm sure the next episode will pick us back up, it's amazing we get these two-three months during which we know we just...lost. I don't think this ever happened before in this franchise.
---
The bomb route is so much harder with slippery slope. You can actually slip into the dredge suit detection range. 
---
The difference now is that Kralkatorrik is on the verge of destroying reality as we know it. There's not time left to stop him at this point without resurrection or some other Deus Ex Machina.
---
Also, I feel like regardless of what happened, fans would be both praising and complaining about the story. Let's face it, Game of Thrones has made endings like this just as cliche as resurrections, fake out deaths, etc. As someone has already said, there are no original stories. Just variations on existing ones.
---
Now I have an excuse to make it for the nostalgia hahaha
---
I have over a 1000 and I buy trinkets and occasionally t6 mats with them, so you're clearly not logging in every day to get your daily log in rewards, of which are many laurels.
---
Trinkets from laurel vendors and ls3 maps. 
---
Yes. I freaked out and my party was like???
---
Whats with big companies killing out main characters out of the blue? is that the new popular cliche? we got it on infinity war, then on super smash bros ultimate, and not Arenanet its taking a bite out of the cake too?
---
Went into this thread looking for this. NPC get all your buffs/heals so you can rig the game yourself. Some healers have more precise healing so you can just heal one of them.
---
If you heal both of them, it won't end....
---
I get that, I really do. Still upsetting though. Plus I wasn't expecting Caithe to basically mind meld with Aurene (I expected her to do something).
---
Also mildly frustrated that the Commander apparently doesn't think much about how Aurene feels, they literally say that at the start of the episode. 
---
I think its great myself. Personally if i were anet i would look into a setting that lets you toggle item information. little check boxes like \[\]crafting \[\]storage \[\]merchant sell \[\]trading post sell \[\] trading post buy. While i know the game probably doesn't support tooltips that update like that it would be an interesting quality of life change and would help solve the new player issue, essentially i would have it so the info is hidden until they reach the appropriate milestone. 
---
So glad to finally so this in-game! Job well done :)
---
And it's not even the first time this happened to her. First Faolain, then the egg stealing, and now this. Caithe really can't get her purpose in life.
---
Incidentally, does it even have to be another dragon who replaces a Elder Dragon? During Path of Fire while in Kesho we're told:
---
"We theorize these vacancies must be filled with ***entities*** that circulate and share magic rather than hoard it."
---
So, do you think something else like the Pale Tree could fill such a role?
---
This episode wretched me. I spent 15 minutes just staring at the door as you come out of the instance while crying...
---
Very powerful writing and it is still tearing me up today. 
---
Chrono trigger this shit!
---
This story tore my heart out. Hearing Taimi crying and then seeing Aurene's body there was too much. From a story telling perspective, I love it. From an emotional perspective, how could they do that to my scaly adopted daughter?!
---
I wish I could jump into the game and give her (Caithe and Taimi as well) a big hug and tell her everything will be okay. 
---
How does OC make it equal? Just summarizing user experience, call it a bandwagon but it aint stopping yet.
---
For the Thunderhead Keep heart where you have to kill wurms or scan dig sites, there seems to be a bugged wurm spawn.  On one of the bluffs, there is something like 15 veteran ice wurms spawned on top of each other.  This is a glitch that can be abused for quick clearing of the heart.  I was able to complete the heart on my ele after just spamming Lava Font...heart cleared in a few seconds.
---
As per usual someone reads something on the forums and comes out with bullshit. First of all can we get the release dates right living world is every TWO TO THREE MONTHS the time  table has not changed. Episodes 2 and 3 were delayed because of unforeseen bugs as Anet explained at the time. Episode 4 released within the time table of 2 to 3 months and episode 5 was delayed because of Christmas and Anet didn't want to released wintersday and a living world episode at the same time because of the possible bugs so I don't know where people keep getting this 4 to 5 month time table from. Now onto to the bullshit I read this post the only thing Z mentioned when referring to expansions was they want to do expansion level features and story in living world does this mean no more expansions in the future no of course not for one expansions are good money makers. This just means that features like mounts and story like the one today aren't being held back for expansions it doesn't mean there isn't a team right now working on an expansion for say Cantha story but the story just isn't there yet. Please actually read posts before posting threads like the these Z just reiterated what he said in August and that is season 4 to season 5 and expansion level features and stories aren't being held back for expansions.
---
Male charr just sounded like he was giving up
---
ONLY I HAVE THE BRAINS TO RULE LYLAT.
---
What's wrong with Caithe?
---
for me the best line is when one skritt says that the Priory are Honorary Skritts cause they also look for shinies everywhere
---
&gt; small chance for GW3
---
What would you like gw3 to be? MMO, anything else, related to Tyria, etc?
---
Damn. Stay away from poor impressionable Anet with your diamond hard teeth. The rest of us need functional instrumental torches. :o
---
Its not a sax.
---
...
---
Its a blowtorch
---
I tried quickly grabbing another barrel after the first one got empty, and I still couldn't pour any more oil.
---
I think that you are only allowed to have limited amount of oil fields, no matter how many barrels you grb.
---
i've always had everything at max and thought it sounded great, so i'm genuinely curious... what does resetting to default audio do? are there changes to the actual quality levels of sounds or something?
---
i did press the defaults today since the patch notes suggested to, but then i turned everything back up. maybe that's why i haven't noticed a difference.. lol
---
That's true, but he is now back in the mist healing and have no reason to come to us again before being back in shape.
---
Also, eithouy aurene we cant damage him much anyway (we needed those crystals to wound him). 
---
My theory goes on resurrection.  Aurine absorbed the energy of Palawa Joko the unkillable and Zaitan the Undead Dragon (Note: Zaitan's energy was through Mordremoth, who had absorbed it himself). Regardless, I will be surprised if Aurine doesn't resurrect one way or another....
---
Then again, the next expansion might be in the Mists. Who knows.
---
What did Glint tell her?
---
I haven't played it with any others yet, but male asura is also stellar. (Always is, IMO.)
---
Taimi's voice actress also deserves all the kudos. Everything she's done this season has been gold.
---
You can:
---
1. Buy for yourself, and gift the items (limited choice)
---
2. Send gold for them to buy gems
---
3. Buy gem cards
---
4. Send moneyz to paypal
---
5. Your method, and hope no automation will mess your purchase.
---
OOoOoo.. imagine: new in the gem store.. DIAMOND GRILLS! 
---
i keep losing connection every minute after logging in
---
Can't swallow us whole if he can't tell where to bite! Ha! 
---
Ah, thank you! I'll have to run it through with my sylvari. That's totally a retcon of previous information! Weird!
---
only stable source, achieves give you a little for much work, are you on f2p / why do you need laurels?
---
brb getting my heal tempest
---
Opened 50 Pact Caches so far... only got Daoud boxes... might be bugged. Coz why not just use the Daoud crates from other maps then. Seems like Pact is supposed to give all types, but is bugged
---
Challenge Mode, basically a harder version of the encounter. Atm there's only two CMs for fractals, 99CM and 100CM. Raids have their own CMs too. 
---
Let's just say after you successfully completed CM, everything else will seem easy to you :p
---
Yea that definitely was a nudge at MWH and I loved it!
---
1) I would assume it works just as any other set for stat changing.
---
2) You have to purchase the recipe to craft them, which costs 25 branded mass, 5 goss patches, 5 ecto, and 3 exquisite serpentine jewels. You can get all three easy, but the jewels you can only obtain once a day. To do so, you need to get Light of Deldrimor Plate, which you make from combining the top and bottom half you get for participating in the metas OR buy off the TP. After that, you take it to Frodak left of The Hammers Horde POI, who gives you a plate and a buff. You use the plate on the teleporters of the corresponding color, use the buff to reveal hidden chests, and once you get to the "treasure room" the 3 jewels are contained in a hidden chest inside the middle of the room. 
---
3)Weapons are a yes, and trinkets I believe so. Weapons are pretty much obtained the same way through the insignia except with an inscription, more branded masses, and you have to buy the recipe as well.
---
You know Resistance, the boon that protects from conditions? It lasts longer. 
---
I never thought about that... it's really, really weird actually.
---
It would have made a ton more sense for Renegade to have been in HoT and Herald to be in PoF.
---
But now that Glint is an actual character... having her also say old lines to you in the midst of everything going on is just strange.
---
"All or Nothing"
---
More like all for nothing -sob- 
---
I must have missed that part at the start.
---
And yeah, I'm talking about the final scene... ....
---
Hmm, notice that everyone points out Joko as a theory for her to return but no one mentions the fact that we have this entire mastery line that is all about **bonding** with Aurene which grants us powers, right? If she were dead we'd lose those powers. Yeah, Caithe's flowers turned to dust and she can't sense Aurene but neither could the Awakened sense Joko when he first died before coming back and pulling a monologue on us, which is why the Awakened were all stunned at first. 
---
I'll hold onto that hope because Aurene was too much of an emotional investment for her to go out. Too much time ramping her up to just kill her? No way. ... I hope. But I doubt it. Everyone had hoped that Blish was still alive but... well.
---
I think this technically counts as a Reaper buff, since they don't give a shit about teamwork
---
But Joko never died, he was actually immortal. Burn him, impale him, whatever, he wouldn't die. He could fake it, but he wouldn't ever actually die.
---
And Aurene did die. Her body, motionless, impaled several times over.
---
She might have unbound his magic and killed him, and literally ingested him, but she doesn't have the spell that he used.
---
 /s
---
Okay.
---
Most hot hero points you are able to solo, a lot of them dont even require you to fight anything. In verdant brink alone you can get 9 out of 11 with exploration. The only difficult ones being the frog dude and the bat dude.
---
Same with the other maps although the other ones are a bit harder where you can probably only solo half of them or so...  it should be enough for you to get most of the spec unlocked. 
---
Other than that, ask in map chat for help with a specific one or check the lfg tool for hero point trains that happen every so often.
---
Either she will be ressurected or there will be some asspull and commander will have godly powers to contain magic
---
And, what, you think Elder Dragons besides Primordus would look at fire magic in front of them and go "nah, gonna let Primordus have that one." Do you think Elder Dragons besides Zhaitan would see death magic and go "nope, not gonna consume it"?
---
If dragons could utilize any magic they ate, there wouldn't be such a thing as "Elder Crystal Dragon" or "Elder Fire Dragon". They'd all be prismatic dragons as they go eating all magic they can reach.
---
The only reason why Primordus and Kralkatorrik can use death, shadow, plant, and mind magic is because the Elder Dragons connected to those spheres in The All were dead. It's unclear how Aurene and Kralkatorrik could use Balthazar's magic, but he was a former god who didn't follow Tyrian magic rules so speciality may apply.
---
Of course we will.
---
You make jokes, but Aurene has Joko's magic right? So she should be able to bring herself back...
---
But thats just a theory
---
I feel like he sidestepped the question. It was a simple, yes-or-no question
---
Cool
---
Caithe says Aurene is gone.  Rewind to the end of episode 3 for a minute.  We defeat Palawa Joko.  Enter Braham. "The awakened are in a stupor". For a minute there it had seemed as though Joko was truly vanquished...and then he rises again for his 'real' death in the following cutscene.
---
There was a pause on Joko's control over the awakened when he was killed.  There may have been a pause on Aurene's "bond" with Caithe, when Caithe says "she's gone".  Immediately fading to black, and given that Aurene never died before and may have to trigger the absorbed Joko magic indicates (to me at least) that she will rise again shortly.  But maybe not.  Who knows?
---
Ask me your questions, Bellriver; I am not afraid!
---
excuse me sir but your build looks odd
---
Equaling Anet employees performance evaluation and a "Great work!" because the launch was smooth is cynical. Same with your sidejab at the official forums. Or your critique at the GW2 content philosophy. Or equaling "Great work!" with standing ovations. Or calling the release average.
---
Everything about your post is cynical, dismissive and negative and argues in bad faith. Why are you here? Take a break from the game. From the internet as well. It's not good for you.
---
That's the thing though isn't it? It was hilarious for the first 5 minutes. I couldn't stop laughing as my team was struggling to go up the ramp.
---
Thing is, the novelty wore off very fast and it just became annoying. It didn't make the content difficult and I didn't feel challenged. It just made the fractal longer and irritating. 
---
...huh. That's a really interesting theory. It *would* deal with the whole "we killed two elder dragons and now need to kill a third one but killing them destroys tyria" thing. 
---
And then as long as we can deal with S peacefully, we'll have taken care of the elder dragon issue.
---
Fun.
---
So chaos fractal is ok with this instability? Gonna be fun üòÄ
---
The new map has those two farms, as well as at least 2 rich mithril veins that I've found so far(can't recall exactly where right now though).
---
The map is in the Deldrimor Front and has all of the main ingredients to the Deldrimor Steel Ingots...coincidence?  Not at all, entirely expected.
---
What did she say?
---
Nice
---
There's a maximum of five or six pours, you can only pour a new one when the oldest disappears. 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I think this part is very important because she may be trying to tell us something important about the upcoming battle, or she might be trying to tell us whatever Glint has planned with her in her lair.
---
I think it's interesting that during the "fake' battle she showed us, we destroy his eye, and he pulls back with his eye destroyed.  
---
I don't think that detail is insignificant. Aurene is showing that we must destroy his eye for some reason. It could be literal or symbolic.
---
My theory is that Kralkatorrik is using the **power of prophecy** against us. This is why he was able to pre-emptively strike us early before our plan to blow up the mountains, why he attacked the Underworld before we could stockpile Bloodbound Spears, and why Kralkatorrik seems to have such a stranglehold over fate.  It's also explicitly stated that Kralkatorrk can see the future, and he fears the future he is gone. 
---
In destroying his ability to see the future, then the Pact can finally ambush him.
---
Aurene transferred her soul (what's the proper name for it in Tyria lore?) to Caithe, because she knew the dragon body was destined to be destroyed. Aurene is still with us in the body of Caithe. 
---
PUKAH

Because a moderate OC on any Ryzen chip will equal the single core performance and IPC of their intel counterpart chips with ease across most workloads. I own multiple systems with both intel and amd cpu's and the difference in frame rates in games is negligible with some exceptions. Some games "favor" intel, some favor AMD. GW2 has an old ass engine that can't properly utilize modern day CPU's instruction sets and mostly rely's on high frequency and an efficient architecture to get the most out of it. In that regard, both intel and AMD cpu's are fine.
---
Also whats the purpose of the heroic font?
---
Same for Electrophobia.
---
Thanks for answer but I already wasted 2k volatile magic for trying agian with scroll :(.
---
Raze Joko!
---
Pretty sure it's the same line across all race/gender combos. Just delivery.
---
I usually have it muted, click default during tarir meta, instant regret &gt;.&lt;
---
I didn't notice any meta events.  I guess I'll have look back tomorrow.
---
LOL.
---
That's a lie because tOOTHLESS DOESNT DIE AFTER AN ENTIRE 2 YEARS OF BUILDING A LOVE AND CARE AND GAINS A VOICE THAT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S SO OVERWHELMING HOW MUCH THAT ADORABLE DRAGON LOVES AND TRUSTS YOU AND ONLY DID THIS BECAUSE THEY KNEW YOU KNEW THE WORLD WAS GREATER THAN ALL OF THIS.
---
He's so sweet, though I admit I couldn't stop thinking of diabetes when I read his name. Habit from work. 
---
OK everyhing is cool but my reaction to this picture was "WTF IS Jaina doing here!? Oh... nvm."
---
I feel kind of... empty. Playing this arc out since Season 2 only for Aurene to just... die? I just feel very defeated. I really thought this was our big victory.
---
Same here. When I saw the space between my spills I was sure that it wouldn't work, but surprise! It did. 
---
is in the video about Six years of Living world , so you can check in the youtube channel for the exact moment.
---
Took about 4 tries.  It's a puzzle, don't quit so easily.
---
It's super pretty! 
---
Anet, well played, great episode, thank you for the emotional rollercoaster! 11/10 I will play the story again to see what I missed the first time. I don't buy the ending, I think there is more to it - or so I hope :)
---
MASTERPIECE. Thank You!
---
Yes, they are paid to do a job. Yes, doing the job well is part of "doing the job". But now that I'm in game development, and seeing how things are done, I can say this: Even for a non-AAA mobile game, we can QA like crazy and still miss really stupidly simple stuff. Trust me when I say we beat ourselves up over it before even the players do.
---
The reality of software development is: the longer the product is in its life cycle, the greater the likelihood of unforeseeable bugs getting past the QA. That's the case for a mobile game, imagine a AAA MMO the scale of GW2.
---
Context is everything, and in this case, yeah, they deserve some kudos.
---
"People aren't nice to me, so neither should anyone receive any courtesy."
---
Noted.
---
What kind of asshole thanks people for doing their jobs properly, lol
---
^^oh ^^wait
---
Can also confirm, thousands of hours on both
---
You get it from WvW too.
---
&gt; architecture 
---
yea, thought they were different for the two, good to know they are same now
---
I didn't think about that. Interesting.  And if kralky did absorb her magic like OP posted, then should we be worried he got a bit of lich magic?
---
&gt; same 
---
different but equal
---
Also, in the Catacombs, supposedly you get the orange plate from the Skelk in the purple plate room - but you get the purple plate from the story and after you've done it you can't get another purple plate. 
---
I was thrown through the room, but not downed....lucky me?
---
This also makes sense.
---
With his future sight gone, or even half of his physical sight gone, he will be in a super disadvantaged situation where we still have Dragonsblood Spears and weapons plus our army isn't actually exhausted due to the ambush and sacrifice of Aurene.
---
Can't you just leave via WvW/PvP?
---
How do you use this Light of Deldrimor? IIm in the tomb.,.
---
More than just ancestor of Logan, Gwen is probably the most badass human of the whole franchise. And I say this as a Charr fanboy.
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gwen
---
Nevermind the fact that Wynne asked Caithe to do it?
---
Man anet, what you doing to my daughter :(
---
Yeah I figured it out. Not very intuitive for locating the chests.
---
Ok.
---
https://youtu.be/ceSjbwi0S5E
---
She'll be back.
---
Honestly? Here are my thoughts and predictions for the next episode. I don't expect anyone to read this, but it'll make me feel better by writing it, and if someone does, you can cling on to this too.
---
The devs have come a long way in their writing lately. I study creative writing academically and do a lot of it myself. Quality-wise, the best writing in this case would be to keep Aurene dead and find some other way to stop Kralk sans-deus-ex. We've already weakened him a lot, so there's our key. That would be amazing writing... but I don't see that happening, and there are other ways to continue this story and still have good writing.
---
Personally, I see three possibilities. The less likely of the two is going to get Aurene out of the mists... I dislike this one because it removes the fear of death. When they killed the commander, they immediately brought them back. They should have waited and had everyone about to suffer a devastating lose at a critical moment, and only then does the commander return. They've already done something far too similar to simply going into the mists to fetch Aurene.
---
The second possibility is ascension. Now, I'm a little foggy on all of this in Guild Wars, so I can't say how likely or accurate this is... but following the "higher plane of existence" that ascension usually is, Glint spoke to Aurene alone to tell her of ascension. The reason I'm doubtful about this is because if Glint knew about ascension, why didn't she ascend? Unless she foresaw her doing so would make them lose somehow or she only discovered those secrets in the mists.
---
The third, and most likely possibility, is a lot like the first. We go into the mists to fetch Aurene. The difference is the commander's bond to Aurene. You might think Caithe because of her resonance, but Caithe's flowers very clearly vanished. The commander is not only Aurene's champion, but has literally died in the past. Maybe Aurene being alive at the time was the thing that really allowed the commander to come back. If that's the case, then Aurene can come back too.
---
Adding on to this, some achievements show on party member bars as eligible but completion never triggers. Effectively making them instance owner only (Electrophobia and Stubborn).
---
Oddly, I started using geforce experience to launch the game and it feels much more responsive,

I'm begging of you please don't make more Brand.
---
Please don't do it just because you can.
---
Your wording's a little confusing, but we aren't getting an expansion pack after this season. We go right into season 5.
---
Does anybody have a location of the new mastery insights on the brand new map?
---
I need 2 more and i have a full lvl bar :(
---
Who the heck is Klark? xD
---
Tac0 is eye-sore and dps meter is the bare minimum you'd use add-ons for. I just want add-ons that aren't "in the edge of legality, might change policy rabdomly" or installed through weird dll links and files
---
You stay away from the mini!
---
She's a jinx.  A bad omen that only sorrow and bad tidings follow in her wake.
---
It's lovely the way it hurts, isn't it?
---
And only two new weapon sets to go with it. Awful for a free update. /s
---
Klark Kentorrik. Just a normal dragon working in newspaper. But his true identity is.... 
---
Hard node spawns are usually capped to a daily maximum to limit alt farming.
---
She's kind of become the face of guild wars 2 I doubt it's the end for her
---
It wasn't something we tested I must say, but if that is the case then that could be another way to mitigate that damage :)
---
Thanks for the advanced tip ^^
---
So, basically just make a list and tick them off 
---
ascended collection
---
&gt; I‚Äôve already parked my alts there
---
Why? The Elder wood farm can't be beaten, ever. Its worth more, respawns every hour and its all clumped up. Even if you need the plat/iron its better to farm the wood and sell it and then buy the ore you need.
---
Did anyone trying pressing the walk button?  Did it help?
---
When I was PvP'ing I had stacks of those pvp xp potions saved up. And new content usually had the reward as final step in reward track.
---
It was basically log in, unlock reward track, get shiny.
---
So whats with the whole dragonsblood weapons stuff that was advertised? Was it just the spears you use in the story missions?
---
Sweet. It's very usefule!
---
I saw the wiki, just wanted to check if there was any particular strategy for getting the points quickly, since I'm very bad at exploration and famously impatient when it comes to the story quests ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Honestly, ANet has already written themselves into that hole.  If she stays dead, it feels like theft, but if she rises back up, it feels contrived.
---
the more i think about it the more i think that her visions in the last episode zeroed in on the point that she absolutely had to meet an end to move things forward.  That kind of realization is a major thing to come to terms with along with all of the responsibilities placed on her.  
---
As a story point this season has charted Aurene's quick maturity from adolescent starting to understand who she is but maybe not understanding the gravity of things.  Then being a bit brash but starting to step into a mantle of leadership as she experiences the war against Kralk directly.  All the way to now, gaining an understanding of the bigger picture through interacting with both us and her mother and maybe coming to terms with her needing to die first in order to move things toward a favorable timeline.  Maybe without fully knowing what has to happen after that.  
---
It might be our job as the Champion to lead the Scion back to our side in some capacity.  Maybe we'll have to return to the Domain of the Lost, where Kralky was before, to get Aurene back.  It would be interesting if she needs to take a similar journey of soul reflection to strengthen her resolve before coming back and fully maturing.  Maybe this is her version of Ascension based on the secrets revealed to her by Glint after the trials, needing to ascend to become strong enough to confront Kralk for real.
---
...And just exactly how would she do that, again???  Wouldn't she need to have absorbed the magic of somebody or something who knew how to swap bodies?
---
The dragons blood weapon skins that were leaked and shown in other news sites are the exotic harrier weapons that you can buy the recipes for from the VM vendor at the Observation Deck for Laurels. They come with the new Diviner stat type. Supposedly the NPC mentions that they can be "upgraded" in some way but at the moment I'm not certain.
---
when you say meta events are you referring to the defense of thunderhead keep?
---
Probably because if they didn't throw the hints hard and fast, people would miss them and really be down/angry considering all we've done together.
---
"i once saw him kill 3 vets in a bar with a rusty scrap."
---
What about that Dragon to Dragon talk Glint gave aurene after the trials? Maybe she told him how to not be kralkafied cuz... You know, she has a first hand experience of being killed by papa kralk. 
---
Yes, and staying in the spotlight for too fucking long is intrinsically linked to bad writing.
---
I'm a casual player and I share your confusion. There are so many things to know and do that you don't know where to begin and it's all a bit bewildering sometimes. Once I figured out that dungeons give decent loot and experience, as well as being a fun way to play in a random party, I really enjoyed the experience. However, once you start unlocking masteries it seems to get complicated again. Which track do you pick? Where do you get the mastery points? How much experience do you need? What about getting really strong gear? Idk, I just want to have fun while my character gets slowly stronger. 
---
i have a crush
---
Don't know, since ANet could have done like what they did with the Griever insignia/inscription and have it named something entirely different, or that the orichalcum inscription item is just there as a box that lets you open and pick which inscription or insignia recipe there is. I'd probably wait and see for a bit.
---
There's also one more thing people tend to forget - Elder dragons are not just your regular PHYSICAL beings. Elder dragons are a force of nature - Tyria itself. It was the Pale Tree that once said to us that "It's not the continent" when people talk about it. They are everywhere. That's why we have major issues when one of them dies.   
---
That said - I love all the new theories popping up but as with mordri - we potentially don't have to kill Kralky in the "real world". We might as well be able to do it in the Mist with full power of all of our lost allies.   
---
Just imagine how brutally epic would be a fight where we get Snaff, Air, Glint, Aurene, Tybalt, Traherne and everyone else we lost during the last couple of years! AND when Kralky dies in the mist - they all get to share the magic together - not having to deal massive damage to the "outer" Tyria
---
Also, the expansion content feels better integrated and more immersive, at least to me.
---
I think it's a problem of the extremely tight time-schedules of LS episodes that they have to be this ... samey.
---
Each with their own mini-zone, with a handful of repeatable hearts, the same few events essentially copy&amp;pasted all over, one new "big" feature, a piece of story, done.
---
There's never something like a Dragon's Stand in there. Can't be, either, it'd be too niche for gobbling up 90% of the zone resources for the timeframe they have. It barely made it into HoT as it is, but it's the **differences** between the zones which makes them so great. The new zones feel same-y, much as they try to make them seem less so by jumping all over the world.
---
Anyone know where to blue plate is, it's driving me crazy? Looking at this guide I'm wondering as was mentioned it's random so if i did it again I might find it in a room?
---
Hold onto your hope, remember what Glint said, we have to provide it for Aurene!
---
so aurene dies?
---
Not everyone has a profession slot for every single class, or plays every single class.
---
Releasing elites for a single or a few classes just leaves everyone who doesn't play those out. 
---
She can't be dead *yet*. ANet still haven't released the Aurene griffon mount on the gemstore.
---
Let's also take a moment to appreciate the amazing music during the last story scene. The 'operatic' singing give me goosebumps the whole fight!
---
Legendaries dont even come close to elite specs. It‚Äôs not about games doing it or not doing it. It would just suck to see every class but your main to get a spec months before yours. Elite specs are one of the biggest part of the game, and you can‚Äôt release them in parts. 
---
Oh right, Joko, I bet that's it. If Joko's magic brings back Aurene, I'll actually, for the first time ever, praise him.
---
Loved the episode but its not the best :/ "A star to guide us" ep is tough to beat imo with that beautiful map and rich content
---
finally bought the 2 expansions. That was nice.
---
&gt; (*) that I can think of, pleace correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Depends on your definition of "armour". Forgeman has a fair amount of metal plates but looks ridiculous and far too heavy to be usable IRL. Male Glorious appears to have a metal breastplate while female Radiant is less protective than your average hoodie. With Elegy/Requiem I can't really tell what the chestpiece is supposed to be made of. Female Envoy is Wonder Woman style "armour" - absolutely worthless in real combat but solid metal in the few areas it *does* cover.
---
If you're willing to accept non-rigid armour which *could* be on par with RL gambeson just look for anything without exposed skin. Country and Student legwear are close enough to [bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bases_\(fashion\)) or cloth tassets to be practical, unlike your typical ballgown-with-exposed-panties.
---
[fixed](https://imgur.com/ClvBBni)
---
Now that's some funny shit. Well done xD
---
Haven't played the episode yet but im glad shes dead. Unnecessary deus ex machina and killing her shows writers have at least some sense of decency.
---
Except a good amount of movement skills dont work anymore with slippery slope or are just clunky af.  
---
Try deepstone fractal with it...
---
Doesn‚Äôt Cauthen know the plan too now? Maybe she‚Äôll tell us what to do next
---
If Aurene knew of the coming death, didn‚Äôt Caithe also know about it?
---
I want her hairstyle now, it's in the game now
---
Combo that with the new social awkwardness and its going to be heaven 
---
&gt; In fact, most people aren't cut out for it.
---
Agree.
---
&gt; When we talk about "skilled" labor I think it's disingenuous because what we mean is "educated labor."
---
Fair point.
---
&gt; In food service, you have to remember massive quantities of orders, know how to make like 40-some different recipes without hesitation.
---
Waiters and doctors are still wizards to me. As an IT guy, internet is an extension of my memory, I couldn't work without.
---
&gt; Also, you have to deal with being constantly emotionally abused by customers and management. And sometimes sexually harassed by direct supervisors and the occasional patron especially if you're a woman;
---
Yup. While women can also be harassed here (wonder why there aren't that many in a man-dominated field), everyone can say fuck off and call it a day, there are plenty of companies to work with, and finding another job is rather easy. Supply and demand bring some privileges.
---
&gt; Management in Food service is generally poor across the board, and that's why a lot of chain restaurants are dying. 
---
This can also be encountered in IT field ... and especially in public service, that cannot be shut down easily :/
---
&gt; On the flipside, I work with physics residents who have 8 years of education who aren't quite as good.
---
I couldn't work in your field. I just don't have the character. I wouldn't pass the first month, I just cannot take crap from anyone. So my contribution is to not disrespect "uneducated" workers and not make their work harder than it needs to be ;)
---
Akili still buggy (?)
---
would using flesh wurm/sand portal/blink/jump shot/etc. for ramps help maybe?
---
It's fun the first 10 minutes then it's just boring and frustrating... I would rather have the previous last laugh...
---
Maybe it was smooth because public interest was incredibly low...
---
I think I read at some point that they don't want the game to become an interface focused game. So while I see the optimization aspect, I actually like it when they shy away from some of the potential add ons
---
What if Kralk is just fucking with everyones mind? He did absorb part of mordi's 's power, and during the fight Rhytlock says something about Kralk using Zhaitan's power.
---
nobody cares about the forums, why even post this here.
---
I used gw2efficiency.com for this purpose all along, now I no longer need to check how much materials I have out of game! 
---
No wonder they had the change the "hungry cow" + "cow food" at the 1st heart in queensdale
---
Played it with a half static group (3/5) and I liked it. It has take a little bit to get used to it, but at some point we jumped must of the time and it was fine.
---
Ye it was not difficult or hard, it maybe added 30 seconds extra time due to laughing and last boss the spots on left as you enter are actually small ramps so we decided to fuck it and pull it to one of the left sides instead.
---
But i can also imagine a pug with nobody ever could finish sab etc. Imagine the fiesta even @ placing bombs. I'm pretty sure a lot of things that don't effect us ruin things for most groups. It is just soooooo fluffy anyway idk why it has to exist.
---
I want to see that sweet cliffside adds with 300% back/side dmg on pugs. They'll wish they had this one instead :P
---
This instability is bad because there is nothing positive about it to benefit your run, and there is nothing to counter it. Bad design
---
And new instabilities will make some people quit fractals
---
I think it is kinda random - daily or what ever based which rooms you can join. For me for example. I got the green plate from Ogden. In this room i found the purple plate. From the skelk in the purple room I looted a red plate. In the room of the red plate I got a green plate and there I was in the last room. (Use your special action key in every! You can loot 2 hidden box in every room with light of Dwayne special action key skill.)
---
With regards to trinkets, they are currently available from LW S3 episodes for map currencies. This may be an error on ANet's part seeing as Diviner's PvP amulet is apparently a PoF exclusive, or they may be including Diviner's gear as a "core" stat set. 
---
Raid gear - weapons, armour and trinkets - can be purchased and chosen to be Diviner's. The prefix that includes this stat combination is Assaulter's. 
---
Zhaitan killed Tybalt, he died for it. Mordremoth killed Eir and used Tybalt's form against me, he died for it. Joko kidnapped Taimi, he died for it. But ooohhhh Kralk, you're about to be in a whole new level of DEAD because of this!
---
I know that -- the timer just wasn't long enough, so the oil would vanish while it was all being lit.
---
Yes and no
---
If you have enough characters, you could spend a good chunk of time blitzing the 4 hearts (they all seem to be really quick), but after you do then you're stuck waiting on reset. If you have more time to kill, map completion is a pretty okay idea, especially if you have TP2F stones available to get that last PoI quickly.
---
It's unfortunate how you can only get 1 set of keys per day though...
---
Irrelevant. Also, the problem was in the hitboxes of the oil slick not always matching up + the timer being so short that the spills would vanish while it was being lit.
---
I get some fps drops in Lions Arch here and there. I run gtx 1070 ti, Ryzen 5 2600x, 8gb Corsair Vengeance Ram. But outside of LA, no problem what so ever 
---
Hmm i just died there instead of being trapped. Lucky me i guess
---
So like, does this mean Treesus is going to come back after three expansions?
---
Yeah I was about to say Unity is trash so it must be mobile or something.
---
\+ they would have the stats (the recommended daily achievement)  
---
I suffered, I'm all in with the idea !
---
The well slipped away !
---
While I didn't really care for a lot of this chapter, the Kralkatorik fight was pretty kickass. Thanks, anet!
---
And Charr can wear it. It's great.
---
why the ^(/s) ? This is the most likely option which is highly unfortunate.
---
Yup, You'd think that this wouldn't be an issue anymore but it still is. Really sucks because getting to play through the story with friends makes the experience better, but only the instance owner getting credit kind of ruins that. 
---
Ah yes it was funny watching all those foola trying to lay the trail arpund the fence. But to make a thread now overdoes it a bit. Maybe just don't be an idiot,?
---
The oil is fine. 
---
Damn. Having her being a magic absorbing immortal sponge might just be interesting... and troublesome if Aurene would ever turn insane like Joko.
---
I'm not endorsing it.
---
I'm saying that a little bit of lag can still break the *actual* solution. And *that* is terrible.
---
I can't say I noticed anything extraordinary, but it was pretty late in the evening when we finished! I don't see myself farming it for a particular reason, just dailies :)
---
NO! I refuse to believe it. I'll return to my happy land and play catch with Aurene all day long. You can't make me sad Anet! T.T
---
Same... I was so excited to have new content and was looking forward to the grind for new skins but after that last episode and seeing aurene like that, I couldn't work up the motivation to play the game anymore.  
---
My friend was in the same boat. After finishing the living story we just walked around aimlessly then logged off. 
---
i got kicked out of the instance after the last cutscene (i believe) in the crystal dragon storyline. and i lost all the eligible for achievements.
---
I've been working to get this for the last hour.  Seemingly connected?  Doesn't go through fence.  Good timing around the fence?  Suddenly can't dump oil on the last remaining spot.  Using quickness and swiftness doesn't help.
---
But we win all the time and we only lost like 3 people while doing all of this. It feels good to see that the commander can be broken. We rallied all those people to lure the dragon asking them to risk everything, we failed cause for once a buffed dragon was actually strong, and now we have no plan and the morale is low.
---
It eventually worked, but I had to lower my settings to "Best Performance." A little bit of lag can ruin this puzzle.
---
There‚Äôs a random Weaponsmith merchant in the middle of Deldrimor Ruins that sells it, they‚Äôre near the repair anvil IIRC
---
You get the two parts of the plate through metas. There‚Äôs is one meta at the keep, and another near the dredge area. Once you have both parts you go speak to the dead dwarf guy in the catacombs whose name I forgot and he‚Äôll give you the first plate. All you have to do then is match the plate with the right door and complete the little puzzles 
---
Go through the fence
---
Is it too soon to ask if we can get that final scene as a statue for our guild hall?
---
&gt; completely and utterly destroy
---
what do you mean?
---
They worked hard to roll out the episode without wrinkles. It's impossible to always have this quality on release. You'd know if you knew anything at all about programming, but instead you prefer to whine constantly and be an all around twat because people disagree with your entitled worldview. 
---
Its... Hm, its boring. First encounter is boring, 2nd encounter can be beaten w/o cannon, even in t4 with afflicted yday, next part teaches you why you should NEVER make an lfg like 'new fractal all welcomed', finally the final boss shows you that pugs have no idea of patter recognition and cannot tell difference between orange and green. In general a regular boring fractal with extended puzzle elements and and a final boss thats annoying only because you might land mean instabilities on her. 
---
And no CM
---
I know. Tho I'd rather have add-on that shows potential rich nodes on your map and minimap, rather than huge eyestrain from taco or having website run on background with chat codes.
---
Also wouldn't mind things like chat copy paste, blocking certain keywords automatically, having persons class in color.
---
And extra action-bar just for easy access Blueprints or weapons/consumables..
---
Game works fine now but again, one can dream
---
I'll give props to ArenaNet for doing the unthinkable.  It was high past time we suffered a soul-wrenching defeat.  I can't really say that I'm super surprised because we've been giving them grief for the "invincible commander" for several years now.  I'm glad that they made us go through lots of trials to teach expose her to the world with various optional side-quests and collections.  It makes the loss more meaningful after HoT &amp; LS3/LS4 so far.  I'll be indescribably angry if we somehow get her back because that would be bullshit. 
---
Eye of the storm. * ba dumm tss * Get it?
---
we need more zombies bro
---
I hope not. That would ruin his sacrifice...
---
That blue commander tag makes him look like an off brand aang
---
How are dragon Hunter for PVE content? I read a lot that they don't hold up much to other dps class and they have a small HP pool. Should I still play one?
---
Just think of how many diversity points they will be worth then! Undead/crystalized lesbians!
---
I got stuck in two pieces of terrain there and I'm seriously hoping the waiting for the same one mob to spawn again and again to get those crystals charged was a broken script and not intended behavior because it took forever and was extremely boring.
---
&gt; immediately 
---
Aurene's been around for a while.
---
I figured Caithe's special aurene flowers wilting was anet assuring us that they *wouldn't* do that
---
Learn to read.
---
In typical arenanet fashion
---
It does. You just took too long and now ya mad for being an idiot. 
---
I had a few of these I put off for using for a couple months assuming Anet would fix this. When it seemed like they wouldn't, I popped them - then they finally fixed it. Oh well, I'm missing a ton of skins so it doesn't matter too much. 
---
I blew my laurels on obsidian shards for legendary crafting. I have some regrets.
---
‚ÄòAlmost‚Äô?
---
Yup happened here, logged out and started back in at the end of platform 1, lost all achievements though
---
\*Joko's
---
Agreed. My take is shitty troll, but I'd understand everyone who thinks the guy is a shill
---
Great another item I can't purchase.
---
Even If I wanted to support lootboxes, I can't because they are disabled for my region. (I agree with the law) 
---
This is yet another option unavailable to me. And of course the glider is of very high quality and desirable. With no real direct purchase counter part.
---
Not cool on so many levels. 
---
I can only imagine how offended she'd be to see charr dressing in her outfit.
---
Whatever you say, chief.
---
I'm pretty sure it had moreso to do with freeing Elona's people from his oppressive grip and rallying his forces to face the dragon.
---
I share your love for flat maps too‚Ä¶
---
I recently unlocked and completed all HP needed for all the specialisations of 5 characters of me. It is quite simple and fast:
---
1. Go to [Metabattle.com](https://Metabattle.com) and look for a open world build for standard class (they almost always have atleast one)
---
2. Start with PoF, just search for a LFG party doing w/e in Crystal Oasis and Teleport to friend so you get quick acces to the map.
---
3. Open the Wiki with the map so you can navigate easily.
---
4. Finish all PoF Maps since all the HP's are soloable.
---
5. Go to a Dragon Stand in progress or join a new DS map from HoT, do all the HP's there which are all soloable and fast. 
---
6. Go the Verdant Brink and do the remaining HPs which you require
---
7. If you don't have a WP for Dragon stand or Verdant Brink also use Teleport to friend to easily get there.
---
It is not something else, the achievement itself says what it requires and it has been achieved by someone already, or else we wouldn't know about it since it is a hidden achievement. But it gives 0AP and no title, so it doesn't really matter.
---
&gt; the problem was in the hitboxes of the oil slick not always matching up + the timer being so short that the spills would vanish while it was being lit
---
huehuehue, anyway, we'll get nowhere so bye bye mister, try to have some fun
---
There were cliches there were busted with that movie?
---
I only recently watched it and it was devoid of cliches and tropes as much as guardians of the galaxy was a movie rather than 70% oneliners.
---
I don't get the outrage for TLJ but it was one of the worst written movies I have seen in a long time. 
---
Oh and for something to be darker doesn't mean all the heros die (I know that doesn't necessarily fit with your pretty strawman though) it just means events have consiquences and villains maintain a threat level so there is some form of investment. The reason ned stark dying resonated well with got fans is because it made them anxious about the other beloved and "safe" characters, the reason the villains work well is because they don't exist as cartoon "well i am bad for bad sake" caricatures for the most part.
---
Good writing engages the audience and makes them feel emotions for the characters involved.
---
Shit, deltora quest... kids puzzle books... get this.
---
... Faaair point. Well made &gt;:P
---
Welcome to the mountains. Surprise, they are shaped like mountains.
---
But really...what did you expected? 
---
There's a poi in jahai blocked behind the race.
---
The poi that needs the north meta to start , you can still get if you left of the waypoint and climbed your way there.
---
the real problem is with the poi that needs a key to enter the room "the key's price on the tp will drop down  eventually" but still a mesmer can port you there :3 so it's not that big of a problem.  
---
/cry

With that poi you can run up to the courtyard gate to unlock it.

Once again Z says something and you pick up on it as no more expansion. Read the fucking post again pick out the no expansion part oh you can't. Z said what he has said since the anniversary video season 4 to season 5 and more importantly the devs aren't holding back stories or features just for expansions this DOES NOT mean no more expansions it means that the expansion team is probably working on expansion 3 but if a feature comes up that would normally be held for an expansion say build templates and this feature is ready it won't be held from releases just to sell it with an expansion. There are still features that would need expansions a new race, elite specs (though I feel we are getting a new set in season 5), a bunch of new masteries, a bunch of new mounts, player housing, the list goes on. Expansions make Anet money they may not be the same kind of money grabbing company as Blizzard or EA but they still need to stay afloat giving up on expansions could be a bad ideas I expect an expansion announcement after season 5. Also the fact we are getting season 5 straight after season 4 is because the story makes sense for that because season 5 will deal with Kralkatorrik in a new story arc. Finally we probably aren't getting an expansion because its not ready to be revealed yet. I do think Anet wanted to get expansion 3 out after season 4 but they realised this wouldn't be possible so what you'd rather have a massive break when they could be giving us living world or would you rather have living world season 5 while Anet works on making the 3rd expansion great. But no you read the post and some how come to the reasoning that expansions are done until Anet and no disrespect to the developers but until MO or Z come out and say no more expansions these post are simply bullshit.

First you need to go to  Hogwarts  and learn the arts of  witchcraft and wizardry.

I tried reinstalling windows twice on my computer with no luck. I haven‚Äôt tried it on another system but I have two accounts and neither work on my computer 
---
I just said "this is too much for me" and logged off as soon as I left the instance. Didn't even want to explore the zone. 
---
I've got the soloable points down to a science, but lately I've just been joining HP trains. There are several folks who run them regularly, hitting every HP from Verdant Brink all the way through Tangled Depths (and sometimes the non meta-locked ones in Dragon's Stand, too, if you're lucky). Usually they require only basic gliding, and provide mesmer ports where needed. Just check the LFG in the HoT maps every so often and you're bound to run into one soon enough.
---
If you decide to join a train though, make sure you have the time to devote to it. The best, most efficient commanders can hit all of that in roughly 2 hours or so, but the ones who like to troll and kill as many of their followers as possible along the way (yes, a couple of them do this) can take 3-4 hours to do the same run. Ultimately it's just silly fun along the way, no real harm done, but if you're tight on time you might want to skip out after the first time they port you into poison vines or fly you into the Verdant Brink instakill floor.

This seems unlikely on a desktop machine. His monitor cable would need to be plugged into the wrong socket and his other games would run like crap too
---
Maybe you have tried this already but you could check the following things:
---
\- Have you tried logging in on a different PC? If that works, problem is narrowed down to just your PC where you can't login having problems.
---
\- Have you checked your firewall? Maybe it's blocks the outgoing/incoming connection from the GW2 client.
---
On a different note: Error Code 1076:4:5:2477 doesn't seem to be a common error code, according to the GW2 support page ([https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201863018-Common-Error-Codes](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201863018-Common-Error-Codes)). Maybe a developer on reddit can give more clarification regarding this specific error code?
---
If it is failing to connect then it looks like a networking issue.
---
Is a firewall blocking the connection to the game servers? Have you tried logging in on a different network? 
---
Try taking your PC to a friends house to test and see if it‚Äôs your network that is the problem.

We'd been chasing after her egg since halfway through Season 2.

Do you have any uncommon hardware in the computer? Like an off market audio card or something? I'm thinking that the driver's might interfere with something guild wars related, but it's a huge stretch

I have turned off all of my firewalls. I had the same issue when I was in college (RIGHT after I purchased the expansion) and then I had the issue again when I moved home. I am now having it in my apartment. (All different states)

Well i fucked up. I don't even know where or how i had this information because i avoided the story spoilers threads, but the fact is i know about our pet death... Now, i'm in a state of mind like i was when Gandalf felt from that damn bridge ! I was reading a good book quietly. Dreaming about the adventures of this cool wizard i met few months before in the Shire. And suddenly, that old man (from a 11 years boy point of view) who lead a hobbit and dwarves to rob a dragon fall down and ... that's it ?! Come on Tolkien !! I didn't understood at that time that the Balrog was a huge ennemy.
---
  
---
Now it's just the same ! Come on Anet !!! I read quietly things and others about season 4 and ... *i don't know the details yet (and for sure i finally won't wait friday night to discover them)* ... and what ?! That's it ? And Kralk' is still here ?! Right ? Could She come back in White ? ~~Aurene the White~~ Aurene the Celestial, it sounds great !

You should be able to change regions if you delete all characters.

Probably making Cantha
---
I get both sides of this. On one hand I want to lose every once in a while. Always expecting the win and getting it feels cheap. Let my character feel deep hopelessness in loss. Not just a minor setback but a true "fuck we lost". On the other hand sometimes a cliche story doesn't always mean a bad story. I have recently found great enjoyment in some tropey things. 
---
I still need gw2efficiency because over 50% of my materials are on bank characters, haha.
---
Sucks to be you
---
Same happened to me. I just relogged. Killing wabbits would have been more fun though. 
---
Oh that would be terrible for amd and their future users.
---
PepeLaugh He lacks criticial information
---
PepeLaugh The commander doesn't know
---
Haha yeah, i was like "oh ffs Anet" when i heard that, should've waited until we loaded into the map for that
---
Doing it as a charr, the character replaces "children" with "cubs". I thought it was a nice little detail there. 
---
To be fair we did raise the effing thing from an egg over a year. 
---
Also did it on Sylvari male, he's always so dramatic lol
---
Is that so? Ive only noticed there x). 
---
Dunno, I kinda see it as an encouragement to participate the meta events to get the end completion. Kinda feels bullshit people only do the story, complete map and never return to the new map without experiencing what new events and rewards the new maps brings.
---
I'm a sucker for gregorian chants.  Being greeted to this upon entering the map is indescribable.
---
I was under the impression Jahai was well received and Kourna was poor - There was a whole section in the north of Kourna that had nothing going on.
---
Also with regard to Thunderhead Peaks, I‚Äôd be surprised if you had explored everything the map has to offer in such a short amount of time.
---
Just my opinion though 
---
Didn't Balthazar basically win at the end of LW3? 
---
&gt; than even Jahai Bluffs, which was poorly received.
---
what?
---
according to Ben it blacklisted on categorized
---
It never left a trail.  The upgraded  zephyrite backpacks from this past festival did however. 
---
Oh yes, time to pay some confused Priory fellow 50 gold to ship a dead branded devourer into my home. 
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one that had to reread that 
---
I recall some time ago one of the devs saying that they are aware of the invisibility bug but they are unable to replicate it on their test server. I'm not 100% on this but thats how I remember it. I'm not sure how much you do the 100 challenge mode but like it I said, its invisible more often than not. 
---
Even on paper making the character slide around and taking 300% damage from behind seem unrealistic. Sure the outflanked might work on 99 and 100 boss fractals but like the volcanic fractal where the boss spawns enemies all around you its really hard to avoid the 300% damage and its especially bad to weaker dps characters like weavers. 
---
There are just my opinions and as the update is new the meta might shift into something more fitting for all the new instabilities, but in its current form, i think the update is low quality and outright bad.
---
&gt; I'm primarily a WvW player and this is exactly why I refuse to play on the Deserted Borderland.
---
Then imagine how PvE players felt when they had to run around Borderlands because prior 2015 Gift of Exploration required WvW map discovery. I couldn't finish it because of stupid Vista on Blue side, but then server turned Blue.
---
They shouldn't lock map discovery progress behind anything and force people to do content because this isn't fun at all. Sure, you can get there by teleport to friend or by mesmer portal/portal gizmo but this shouldn't be an option either; it's not how map completion worked for 6 years only and by any means it's no "clever design" worth implementing - this only annoys people.
---
Moreover, the vague plates description in NPC dialogue made me think these are just simply lying around hidden behind coffins or somewhere on vault structures or around the complex and that *would* be actually fine since you got 1 plate already during story progress but then I switched map because I was suspecting plates actually bugged out and guess what, I lost access to first vault. And after changing maps I just gave up and asked map chat which confirmed you do need meta in order to get there by design - "luckily", I ported inside.
---
I was expecting that solving vault access and hunt for plates got own achievement which I can explore in free time but I didn't expect being locked on map discovery progress.
---
I'm in the opposite camp, mostly. I think if they bring her back fully, that drains all the power and potency from those last few moments of the episode. She's dead. She should stay dead - but that doesn't mean she can't still have a significant role to play. Look at what Glint was able to do from the mists .... I'm pretty much convinced Aurene's story isn't over, but it can't ever be the same after that ending.  
---
If they got into a position Intel has been in the last 10 years, minus last year, and went with their way of marketing, then yes, that would be bad.  
---
If they could keep developing as they have these last few years and bring great products onto the market at a great price, then that would be great for everyone. 
---
Apart from struggling against the invisible masses of pirate ghosts on the new fractals, the party im in does everything with relative ease. I feel its a bigger issue for new people trying to get into fractals.
---
ooh... didn't think to try dying. Instead restarted the game when it seemed like there wasn't a way to get to the third checkpoint, and was quite miffed when the instance wasn't started over and I had lost my eligibilities.
---
Further information though, my friend playing Mirage told me she stood in that spot and died when the rocks fell, leading me to believe it might have been due to Aegis blocking the killing blow (I did the mission on Dragonhunter)
---
Just not "Eating it", but also absorving all that magic, and  in the same way kralk could use the powers of the other 2 elder dragons and balthazar (remember last fight when the images appear above his head?) she will use the power of Palawa Joko to come back
---
ahh interesting! thank you for explaining :)
---
I had a blast doing dungeons and group events with a Reaper and Tempest duo.
---
Both Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire are a straight-up improvement on core gameplay and I think they're on sale at the moment. 
---
Heart of Thorns has a lot of challenge at the beginning but evens out as you learn to cope in the new environment. It has a focus on large meta-events with groups of players (look in the LFG - they're still very popular). You get a glider to help move around. 
---
Path of Fire is more solo-friendly and perhaps more like the levelling experience . You can unlock mounts as you progress. 
---
LS1 was a limited-time-only thing and is gone forever. LS2 is decent but a little too focussed on puzzle bosses and quirky mechanics, in my opinion. LS3 is fairly decent and the maps still have a lot going on, with a good story. LS4 is where the magic happens - it's widely regarded as having the best story *by far*, although some of the maps are a little samey in my opinion. 
---
In terms of story, it's Personal Story (takes you up to 80) &gt; LS1 recap cutscene thing &gt; LS2 &gt; HoT &gt; LS3 &gt; PoF &gt; LS4. 
---
Each season is comparable to a season in a TV show... There's a continued narrative that deals with one threat at a time, basically, so if you miss one, you might be a bit confused about the story for a while but will catch up. I honestly think each instalment is an improvement on the last, both in technology and in storytelling (although HoT sits slightly aside because its map metas are so well made). 
---
I will say though that I am disappointed that we dont find any books or papers in the release. or I havent found them yet. its such a history rich region...
---
I found one north-west of stonefall, near a "heroic font" (or something like that), that asks for a vision crystal. The miniature sun was already spawned when I got there though.
---
The 2 meta events take roughly 15min each to complete, and then you have the mini dungeon to get to the dwarven vault. All of those should be active for quite some time since they are required for the dragonblood weapons. Besides most hearts are rather engaging compared to some from other maps from LS4. 
---
All of this pack up for roughly 1.30-2 hours daily for the next few months. Not Istan level of replayability if you're farming gold though, I agree.
---
Wait, what?! I was too absorbed with all the crystals and size of the cave.
---
Now I need to replay that part!
---
The upgraded ones leave a colored trail? 
---
I think you have to take the branded crystals from the ground and throw them at the crystals to spawn veterans. Worked for me 3 out of 3 times.
---
That's nothing they are strangers to. The most ridiculous thing already happened and that was Joko's death in the first place.
---
What if when Mike Z says "couple of years" he means 2 years. Not forever? Ever consider that?
---
She was just Subject 6 in a trenchcoat the whole time. 
---
I agree that making the plate pieces helps, but long-term I don't view that as enough of a solution. Having an acquisition method for the jewels not tied to large group events as I suggest with the heart vendor solution fixes the issue permanently for everyone, with tradable plat parts and meta event rewards providing a boost to the process for whoever wants to get the jewels they need as quickly and efficiently as possible. Win win. 
---
Don't worry, soon we'll get a mini Taimi to prove that everything will be okay forever. 
---
Well... exploration, story and achievements are the main ways to unlock things. You could use a guide (like Dulfy) to help unlock easy ones (which for Heart of Thorns is practically necessary because of the sheer number you need and how hidden some of the "easy" ones are).
---
I assumed you were referring to the pit of his DEBT after gambling his ever-increasing winnings on taking down Kralk. He'll never be a debt-free man again.
---
Same
---
Thank you Myrorr! Nice meme.
---
it's a joke .-.
---
I liked that too but it was ruined by character loudly proclaiming "I'm always achieving greatness!" just afterwards. 
---
By my rough calculation, a full ascended set (without runes or traits) but including all armour, weapons and trinkets will give about 78 percent.
---
With food, utility and concentration sigil you can cap out without traits or runes so I think we'll see leadership runes fall out of favour. Either that or leadership with a berserker / diviner mixture.
---
Glad that worked, but if it's an account issue then you definitely need Anet's support to solve this. They'll have to take a look at your account and figure out what is wrong. Be sure to mention that the f2p account works for logging in, so they maybe can compare what is wrong with the first account instead of thinking it's a computer problem.
---
I originally wrote it the other way around but changed it thinking I was wrong. Jahai was the better map, I mixed them up.
---
That's /u/Crescent_Dusk's shtick, always adding absolutely nothing of value and just being your average youtube commenter in terms of lack of intelligence and attitude except he posts it on reddit instead.
---
Happened to me and I just bunnied out of it
---
That sucks but there's no way around it
---
&gt; its invisible more often than not.
---
Sounds correct/I've heard the same from several subredditors, but maybe it only happens to very few clients only; even Anet says they can't replicate it, so looks like the report data is too scarce. 
---
About instabs, again - they are new - so probably will get fixed/reworked one more time.
---
&gt; update is low quality
---
Compared to any other gw2 update? I have not experienced this one completely, but they all seem on same level - consistently inconsistent ^(/s)
---
That thread is one example of many, in which I have not posted but all of them have relatively similar logs where people having this issue are discouraged to keep asking or trying to fix it beyond just reinstalling the game. 
---
No, it is not your job to fix peoples games, but it is also not your to reply with empty bs like 
---
"its probably your pc dying"
---
"there's lack of communication" (even though all you need are just a few people with the same log to determine it's not isolated, and the crash log just says it all beyond that...)
---
Basically my point is that there is a game-crashing bug, but people keep excusing it and blaming the people who aren't able to play the game properly because of it.
---
I personally have had to kill my game SEVEN times last night to get into the new LW episode.
---
You must first be found after 1000 years, then with help of two friends you will need to master all four elements before you can save the world
---
Notice, that most GW2 players are either top level or are new people who are trying game out and will leave it before level 30. This means that players generate a good supply of materials... as long as you are talking about lowest and highest tier materials. Nobody stays at middle-levels because if you are at about level 40, you are already committed enough to this character to get it to max level. 
---
This means middle-tier materials have the lowest supply. 
---
* T1 &amp; T2 are medium supply and medium price, except for those who level new crafting disciplines those have no demand 
---
* T3 &amp; T4 are low supply and high price with moderate demand, because those are often used as an additional crafting material for high-tier recipes
---
* T5 &amp; T6 are in very high supply thus T5 are in low price, while some T6 have also big demand, giving them better price
---
This is basics of GW2 economics and a reason some players keep a single 40-50 level characters as a "bag opener" that opens and salvages tons of bags from events to get middle-tier materials. 
---
With no competition, they would not.
---
What about the Awakened Sylvari?! The rotting plant aesthetic looked so cool!
---
you know except for the multiple crashes, home node not appearing, getting kicked out of the last story instance and losing achievement because of it. thats only what happened to me but other than that ye it was ok
---
Get back down in your ditch D/D ele nobody actually wanted you to be relevant again

I really prefer it this way. You aren't completely exploring the map if you aren't accessing all areas of it, which you can't do if you don't do the meta.

2018 - 3 Episodes

Ok fine I need it are you happy now

Aurene fought valiantly, Aurene fought nobly, Aurene fought honorably. And Aurene died. 
---
Rewards? There's no rewards worth the effort in the new map
---
You work for your gems (kappa)
---
yea. they are like any consumable blueprints/materials but stored in guild hall ui instead. once used it gets consumed.

It's actually the right way as that's a crotch warmer. The buttons are used to adjust heat intensity and you blow to increase heat spread.

---
Yeah. This means one of either two things:
---
* Five years (since Season 2 with the Egg) of setting up Aurene has been completely and utterly wasted for a single shock ending.
---
* We're going to get a massive Deus Ex Machina to revive Aurene in the future. 
---
thank you
---
so if you wanna do it on several chars you absolutely have to explore it "completely" every single time?
---
&gt; they can just have outfits unlock armour pieces as well
---
I'd love that but then outifts would cost 2k gems.
---
I think outfits could use more toggles; they have headgear already so it's not far-fetched. For one I'd make shoulder pieces togglable as with the "normal" armor: even this new Marshal outfit looks amazing on humans but then the pauldrons get huge and floaty when you preview it on a norn or charr.
---
Omg it broke my heart
---
Oof
---
Soooooooo if something is free it's okay to be bad or best case okayish ... ? Or what is your point exactly now?
---
Yep, good job this time.
---
Be careful what you wish for!
---
Well I mean if you notice the mastery we've been getting through this LS. It's all basically Aurene helping us bond with our mounts. It's her power. So yeh I'm pretty sure it won't be like "Hey guys I'm back!" but I believe she'll be with us in the next episode in some shape or form. 
---
As someone who wastes a bit of money on keys each month I appreciate the occasional wardrobe unlocks but would hardly consider them profitable for getting skins so I agree with this. I don't think the unlocks are a good use of statuettes either especially when you can get lots of gemstore items with them relatively cheaply.
---
Yeah, playing both. More Warframe though lately since i feel burned out with GW2.
---
Confirmed. I guess she was a placeholder NPC and the recipe wasn't moved over. 
---
Dragons are magic sponges.  
---
Aurene ate Joko.  
---
Aurene died.  
---
You really don't see it?  
---
Even Glint told us that she'll have to do the unthinkable.  
---
Aurene already fought Kralky in the past, that clearly wasn't the unthinkable.  
---
Dying and breaking the bond with the person you love most is (especially after Caithe told us that she loves our character to the point it already hurts).  
---
She needed to die in order to trigger the death magic that she absorbed and get attuned to it.   
---
If she's going to be the omni elder dragon, then she needs to become the undead elder dragon as well.
---
The exploration of the "blocked" PoI was quite a cool one for me. Why do you have to take everything fast? It still sucks that it is somehow gated, but the way there makes you appreciate the way these people at Anet make these maps.
---
On the other hand, I was there letting people port to me, for about half an hour. I think it helped quite some distressed people. However, if you were there, I suggest doing it the normal way. It is actually quite fun if you dont take things too serious.
---
At least you didn't have Glint active. Imagine if she said "Everything has unfolded as I knew it would"
---
It's a movement skill, not a combat one. The engage buffs activate on combat skills, that's how it works.
---
BoF is meant to travel a big distance as an exploration skill, so I guess this would never happen.
---
The only problem with Thunderhead Peak was that the events have very long intervals between them.
---
This causes people to wander around aimlessly since some of the areas to explore (the Tomb) needs certain events prior to accessing it.
---
There are also too few event varieties going on, most of them being "help x" or "escort x" 
---
Jahai Bluff's events are very well mixed, with many different types of events going on at all times.
---
Another thing to note is Jahai's unique environmental hazard : Brand tornado. 
---
Thunderhead peak lacks that extra feature which makes travelling from POI to POI less monotonous. 
---
delete your local config files under %appdata%\\GuildWars2\\
---
Yeah, or people will just explore maps instead of do metas for map currency.
---
From the looks, Kralk killed Aurene.
---
In the final cutscene mine *did* glitch... when I got to [](#s "you-know-what") my camera got stuck to the left and so most of it was out of view unless I manually moved the camera, but if let go of the right mouse button it would slowly move back to the left. 
---
And earlier when [](#s "Zafirah")  joined my camera just looked up at the ceiling. Like, where there was nothing. 
---
[](#s "And I got stuck inside Kralkatorrik at the second crystal and had to /stuck to get out. Then I had to die because stuck respawns you at the start of the instance and there's no way to get back to the second crystal if you already used the special action key to get over.")
---
So for me it did glitch quite a bit, although it wasn't gamebreaking. 
---
\&gt; Immediatly.
---
\&gt; 4 years later.
---
But then that means kralk has it as well.
---
Social Awkwardness + Slippery Slopes = highscores incoming!
---
This.
---
That choir are great. Those close harmonies are not easy to pull off and some great diction going on in there. Interestingly i wonder how far in advance this was worked on to give time to learn practice perfect the balance record and tweak this. 
---
My main is named "Herald of Aurene" I'm feeling pretty crappy right now =(
---
The hidden chests in the dwarf tomb don't count for their achievement. The big one on the end luckily does.
---
It is not entitlement to expect a product to work. You dont praise a deli when they make a sandwich that doesnt fall apart. It is entirely realistic to expect something to work when it is released.
---
*uninstall*
---
but not for gameplay reasons.
---
&gt; They shouldn't lock map discovery progress behind anything and force people to do content because this isn't fun at all. 
---
But they just did it again. They never seem to learn.
---
Problem with people like you is, that you're looking at it from a fans perspective, even tho you should look at it as someone from the outside.
---
Which may or may not be true. They crystal dragons are a very messed up family at this point.
---
Ok so a smooth launch and opinions on the content are two different things so they can coexist together.
---
Is slippery slope really unbroken and untested or is it yet another new mechanic they introduce that isn't mastered and made pointless on the first day of release? We get these threads every single patch and then a week later the community has figured the gimmick and its back to complaining about the game too easy and made for casuals.
---
I'm not saying you aren't allowed to complain or be frustrated. Just, give it more than 1 day?
---
Somebody needs a hug.
---
Mists are not "another dimension" as one would think.
---
The Mists may be portrayed as "another realm" but I suspect it's something more of "another layer" of the Gw2 world.
---
So what happens if Kralk's death and magic release ravages the "layer" which is the Mists?
---
I highly doubt Tyria is gonna escape some sort of environmental damage due to the magic seeping out of there. 
---
&gt;  it baffles me that anyone could think she isn't developed as a character.
---
Well I never said she wasn't a character, nor underdeveloped. She is just much better at being convenient when the plot demands it. The amount of solutions she can drum up for the commander to keep pushing forward in the story is ridiculous. There's a reason people keep posting about how annoyed they are with her being the one to always have an answer every time we get a new LS episode.
---
It's extremely lazy story telling. Taimi certainly has character and positives, but it's not why she's in the game. She's there to keep pushing the narrative forward, and it's really irritating.
---
Anyone else here spending their gems on cosmetics instead of storage?
---
I was thinking about this as well... But Kralk would be really stupid if he didn't absorb Aurenes magic right there and then so that she is gone for good.
---
Do people really downvote a meme? Lmao here‚Äôs my upvote lad
---
&gt; Everything about your post is cynical, dismissive and negative and argues in bad faith.
---
How is his comment any of that? He just looks at it from an outsiders perspective, even tho he plays the game, which everyone should do, because else you fanboy about stuff that isn't worth any praise.
---
[Anet devs reading posts like that one.](https://i.imgur.com/y5UKK3o.jpg)
---
jesus
---
I know it's a bit of UI fuckery but it would have been nice to have this info showing the top right and take up less room
---
My character yelled "Mine! All mine!"
---
It seems they re-added the Mini Clockheart (reward for completing all TA aetherpath achievements), I thought they removed that at some point.
---
I personally dislike seeing achievement rewards in there
---
Psssh, give those fanboys some sweet anet laptime.
---
Depending on the employee, it might be like having an extra instability active.
---
We will get expac at Fall, why do you think we will get 5 season instead?
---
&gt; There is always the possibility that they changed nothing but there was less player interested to play it right now.
---
Not saying it def was the reason, but Destiny 2 and FFXIV also released content patches yesterday. 
---
The Mists are actually just outer space. Literally. All the worlds, including Tyria, float around in them.
---

---
it's magic space
---
Kralk could have absorb her magic the moment he killed her. We've seen this when Mordremoth died. It's magic didn't just stay there, waiting for someone to pick up. It exploded in a big boom and spread all over the land. The same thing happened to Vlast with his crystals.
---
So if this rule also applies to Aurene, then Jokos magic should be gone as well. And if not because of the magic explosion, then because Kralk was right there to take it. But then again, Arena Net story telling and if they need to have Jokos magic resist that, then it will...
---
I don't know what the truth is but I hope expansions continue to happen.  I've been playing MMOs for 10 - 15 years.  I've yet to see an MMO move away from the expansion business model and remain successful. 
---
Yeah I'm aware of it, I used to do the weekly keyfarm run pretty regularly but nowadays I'm a very occasional player so I'll just pop on and buy a couple keys each month as my way of helping to keep the game going.
---
depends on specifics, it could also create a magical equivelnant of a black/white hole
---
If f2p: Just make a new account imo.
---
Might also have been an achievement related exclamation 
---
His friends just couldn't convince him that there wasn't some delicious dwarven ale in ONE of those barrels.
---
two fucking expacs babysitting that fucking dragon. I'll be saltly if shes really dead.
---
Why would you praise a company for doing something they should be doing regularly? its nice to have a smooth launch, but I'm not to gush on reddit about it, let's see them continue this performance and maybe we'll talk about how they've improved or whatever.
---
"  Also on a side note remember how, after linking with caithe, she said "I'm not Him." which in my opinion is supporting further this theory."  
---
She said that because everybody was accusing her then of being like kralk and were afraid she'd turn on us, she was roaring after every comment they made until she decided to brand Caithe to speak through her.
---
While true this would conflict with items that are close to the right of the screen or especially ones that have long names.
---
;)
---
I hope the Commander faces some real consequences for this besides just... you know.
---
Many NPCs are just 'sure yeah I trust you, you're the commandr."
---
Maybe after this some less close NPCs will be like "You? Really? You failed. No. You let us down once and we're not letting you let us down again. You barely think through your plans and your failures killed the last shred of hope we had against the dragons."
---
Basically what Joko said starting to come to pass.

Have you seen Kralkatorrik after his blast? Sure the commander suffered another near death experience, but Kralkatorrik was not just reduced to 35% HP, the elder dragon has sustained serious injury. His right eye is gone, likely exploded off of his body from the strain of that last attack. 
---
Sure, we're beaten, but Kralkatorrik is not in good shape. He's likely bleeding energy through his opened wounds. While this might not kill him, he's much weaker compared to before the encounter.
---

---
For the first plate you need 2 parts, that drop from 2 meta-events from the map: one in the north keep and one in the oil tubes in the southern half (you need to complete the event, then follow the people and kill an oil creature). Keep event requires some people but it's not particularly hard, Oil event requires a lot of people (it's like a light version of Serpents Ire), use LFG.  
---
Then again, if her magic didn't explode out of her, which I think it didn't, its proof that it's not over for her.
---
I'm not super sold on the gameplay of the map itself, honestly. Yes, its beautiful, and Yes it's fun to explore. But there aren't many events that happen outside of the metas. The metas themselves have too long a gap between being active to really contribute to that.  
---
Luckily, Dorfstone is being slowly fixed (some fixes in this patch even, dunno if it's enough). Considering that fractals are there to replace dungeons, I'm all for them being varied in type of enemies, bosses, puzzles etc. they contain. Even if some of them are not what I like, I bet there is someone who likes a fractal I consider shit. 
---
shes not a deus ex machina. That is a god in the machine, a plot device were a previously undiscussed, unused god appears above the play and solves all the problems. Not a character who has been developing for 3 years. 
---
Flat Tyria?
---
I didn't even make it to the new map due to bugs...
---
That is very funny! You got one upvote from me Myrror !
---
But it would be absurd for them to assume that Aurene would stay a pet dragon all the time. Especially having in mind that all the LS4 heavily implied Aurene fighting Kralk. If not the dragon powers, then what, scratching the enormous crystal dragon with tiny claws?
---
They did some special camera work this time around because of the scale of the action.
---
Not sure if Ctrl Shift H works on ss, but if you wait a bit ui disappears off by default
---
Finally a character we can relate to
---
It's called Diablo Immortal
---
Anyone else here not having gems?
---
Hmm well, staff isn't really a good weapon -- more of an utility, all-purpose one. Best used in WvW but wouldn't recommend it outside of that.
---
Now, axe and scepter are both good, but for different builds. Axe is power-based (so you deal direct damage), scepter focuses around using damage over time modifiers (with debuffs called 'conditions', such as bleeding and poisoning). Both scale according to different stats as well. Power builds use power, of course, plus precision and ferocity. Scepter uses condition damage, expertise and usually precision.
---
I personally play power necro, so I often use axe/warhorn (not offhand dagger, that's for a condition-based build!) along with greatsword (usable only with the Reaper elite specialization in HoT) and I keep a dagger in my bags for when I want to use it. Since you're a base necro atm, I suggest using a dagger/warhorn and axe/warhorn for leveling up at least, and look at power stats -- it kills things faster in open world. When you are level 80, you can choose whether to stick with power builds or condition builds -- both are pretty good. 
---
Exactly. I did it 4 times yesterday with 3 different groups (2 different pugs and my guild static). It was the first day, we all had to figure out the mechanics for ourselves so it'll be challenging on day one with 0 knowledge of mechanics. But as we completed it, the familiarity kicked in and it was pretty straight forward. I enjoyed it alot and look forward to min/maxing the fractal in terms of mechanics and strats.
---
On Tyria, where half of our allies are ghosts and reality is getting weaker and weaker? You might just be able to walk out of the underworld in a similar manner to Orpheus in Orpheus and Eurydice. Remember, everything in GW2 including the gods leans far closer to classical mythology than hard science fiction.
---
Will we ever see his full body tho? We only see his face and neck no matter what episode we talk about. I don't need to see his full body while fighting him but it would be really nice to see it at least once to get an idea how big he really is.
---
Others than that... It was really epic but I couldn't stop giggling seeing his giant head penetrating that small little cave xD Must have looked hilarious from the outside :D
---
A lot of trash is made with Unity, but Unity itself is not trash.
---
slippery slope is basicly  1000 ping simulator,nothing more. whats next? perma 50% speed reduction aka heavy boots?
---
It's one of the items needed in the recipe for the ascended weapons.
---
It does indeed exist. And its called [Flame-o-phone.](http://www.stefanzeniuk.com/flameophone/)
---
Go buy the recipes, farm/buy the materials, craft. I think that pretty much sums up the way to get them in a non ironical way because there isn't more to it really
---
THat's for the exotic weapons.
---
Outstanding move
---
Woahhhhh ... I doubt t but that's some crazy ideas
---
I got that effect irl. 
---
My friend had her Festive Wintersday Aurene bouncing along behind her. It was a bit of a awkward contrast.
---
It makes sense as a set up for Aurene-Caithe's bond, but still felt too hyperbolic. I enjoyed all the story, besides that part. All that fuzz and Caithe telling to stop it several times was really off.
---
&gt;  I have 70 characters
---
Ehehe, you can stop right there.
---
It is *crazy* powerful in DPS at the moment. I can get 25 might on myself by accident, solo, as well as about 16 seconds of alacrity and about six other miscellaneous boons that I wasn't really checking. I also still had over 20 seconds of fury left when combat ended, with like 20% boon duration. It's not godlike in raid teams any more, but it's still very decent.
---
So, that's why I'm going for diviner's gear.
---
\*a normal size Taimi
---
Fixed that for you.
---
So us 100 hours of waiting for support to respond a valid time period to put in a new ticket, literally all I did was change my cell number and now I cant play.
---
Istan does not require higher gear, as well as SW (RIBA) look it up.
---
Next comes pvp, if you main this mode there is a lot of income from it.
---
Up next, dungeons, if you optimize your frequenter
---
What else... oh yea buy gems - get gold - the best gold/time, the cheapest one if you are at age of employment obv.
---
Long term: map completion...
---
Also practice your internet skills, if you search here, on google and YouTube you will find all of this covered several times from all sides.
---
LS4 portal tome teleporting you to Thunderhead Keep instead of Jahal Bluffs (had Istan and Jahal Bluffs unlocked only though). Also game crashes when trying to use portal tome while in the Thunderhead Keep map
---
With 70 characters pretty sure that issue is one that less than .01% of the playerbase has. 
---
Also, I got all the POI's but one without the help of the meta, and the other one was locked behind an event that I could solo, so still not the meta. Was kinda sad to see people waiting behind a beta closed door to thunderhead keep when they could literally go to the keep via the path over the mountains.
---
My big point is that they finally left out all the stuff to stretch out the episodes. 
---
Some of them felt just like a huge: "do this. And then do it again. Aaaand slay some more monsters. Aaaaaand do it again. Aaaaaand defend thai point for over 5 minutes until you almost died of boreout." 
---
Even the Deaths did not interupt the flow of the story. 
---
It was short But intense.
---
I mean I'd rather he took LA, especially the Sea World LA
---
No see the idea is you go to your enemy, who happens to play the saxophone, and do a good ol' swap.
---
Oh neat, why wasn't this blurred as a spoiler? 
---
The correct answer is "cooo"
---
"Look! Life after death!"
---
i just sat there speechless long after the completion reward window popped up ._. but yes that gif sums up the feels from that episode x'D
---
Idk what this is about but question is what will this change in PvP . 
---
It being a meme is not an excuse for it being a shit post
---
dressed her all leafy since she was studying in the Grove or something. even though the backstory was a mess i somehow find it cool 
---
but yep, drew this for an icon last night since i spotted [this bad boy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Ceara.jpg) on the wiki and thought ‚Äúoh man that hairstyle was cute‚Äù
---
Hi folks! I‚Äôm a returning player who hasn‚Äôt played since before heart of thorns. I was a little overwhelmed upon logging into my old level 80 characters... any advice for returning players? Should I roll a new character to reorient myself (I‚Äôve been thinking about playing revenant or necro)?
---
I agree. I do not want brain dead exploration. Let it require participating in a map event. 
---
dressed her all leafy since she was studying in the Grove, or something? even though the backstory was a mess i somehow find it cool 
---
dressed her all leafy since she was studying in the Grove, or something. even though the backstory was a mess i somehow find it cool 
---
i'm probably overlooking something there, as i failed to find the part where you submit your email for notifications. the gem alert function is there but i believe you have to be online with web page running to see it work.
---
Didnt get a single one in there. FeelsGoodMan.
---
He's pointing out the irony of the dialogue in contrast to what actually ends up happening. (Spoiler alert, it's not glorious)
---
I don't know why they think it's a good idea to make fractals into a short story dump. The first and maybe second time it's okay to listen to the talking, the third time it's already old and just keeps you from playing the game. 
---
That's what annoys me the most about the fractals they released since observatory.
---
Nah camera tech was there for a while, It's just this time they force the player to look at certain way while playing instead of just during cutscene.
---
I agree with you completely 
---
Check the VM vendor in the Forge. It was bugged so that people who already owned another node couldn't see this one in the list, but that was patched last night. 10k VM + 50g
---
Ah cool. I'll have to look for it again. It wasn't listed on the wiki and I couldn't find it last night. 
---
It's bugged. Wait a day or two and it will appear at the main Volatile Magic vendor on the map. This is a recurring issue with the nodes. They copy-paste some code for them and forget to change a link from the previous nodes causing the game to think you already have it. Once they fix the malformed link you will see it for purchase again. 
---
I thought it's been stated there is no season 4 episode 6?
---
If they made quaggans a playable race, I would play them exclusively, and equip them will full quaggan-themed regalia (hat, backpack and all). Just saying. 
---
So pretty O\_O
---
I guess it is more about the community and not that it's not possible. Just imagine the next Episode comes with exactly 1 new elite spec out of 9. Everyone who playes this profession will be overly happy, everyone else will have a big circle jerk on reddit about how unfair the world is to them.
---
so content is only worth something if you have to pay for it?
---
Yes, I had that happen too.
---
Jahai Bluffs has been rerouted to Thunderhead Keep. Thunderhead Keep also routes to Thunderhead Keep. Not sure, if I tried to go to the Sun Sanctum, though.
---
If S4 is 6 episodes again, I could see the next one being us finishing Kralky. Then moving onto S5, either we have another dragon to deal with, or an as of yet unknown threat emerges. 
---
Personally, I‚Äôm hoping that with the death of Kralk, it causes Bubbles to stir and cause more issues, leading us to explore underwater (with another rebalance of combat hopefully), pushing further south and leading to... CANTHA
---
&gt;i deleted my level 80 warrior 
---
You get birthday rewards for the age of your character. If I were you I'd open a ticket with support and see if they can undo this. You could've just benched that alt and rolled another (unless you're at max characters). Generally though, unless your characters are &lt;1 year old I would encourage you never to delete them. Who knows what the future rewards there will be. 
---
Praise Joko!
---
No way these 2 metas come close to Istan in terms of farmability - they're on longer timers for one thing, and require a good deal more coordination (south ice floe one especially), plus they don't spawn a ton of chests to loot as is the case with Istan. 
---
And how are hearts not time gated? You can only do them once per day per character, and I'd have it so the 3 jewels are a one a day purchase per account - that's a 16-day time gate right there to get 48 for all the weapons. 
---
Which is all academic anyway, I'm not Anet, I don't get to make the decisions. 
---
I mean content is great and all but getting an hour or two of story every couple months with little to no replayability honestly isn‚Äôt going to keep myself interested. And I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone. The elite specs alone were the main form of content that brought life back into the game. Don‚Äôt see that happening via living story episodes.
---
Unless it's raised as undead.
---
There's a few threads on it from yesterday still hanging around:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ae0m9t/mike_z_is_it_reply_to_the_redbull_article/
---
I wouldn't worry about it, it's a pretty standard PR response to say: "We're going to make the content as best as it can be". Saying expansion-level content is just saying the content won't be like S1-3 and instead follows a more grandiose story telling (The last few were always a bit fragmented or smaller).
---
Ie. No one expected to fight Balthazar (rightly so at the time, biggest fight was Lazarus) in LS3, and no one expected we'd go actually go up against Kralk either but they delivered on it.
---
That being said, it's not a terrible thing if they cut up an expansion put inside patches instead, it simply means we get better and more polished content over time instead of one big drop and a bunch of smaller/mediocre stuff after.
---
I had this issue about 2 weeks ago. I sent in a ticket and they responded in about 4 days telling me "You should now be able to log in to your account with no error, we apologise for any inconvenience" So im really not sure why you are having so much trouble getting this resolved.
---
Well, fact is, Anet avoids a clear statement about whether there will be a new expansion or not. And to me terms like "release expansion level stories and features over the next couple years" do not sound like a new expansion is ahead of us. But in the end, no one can say for sure. I guess we all hope, that in the near future there will be bigger content releases than the ones living world episodes provided so far.
---
If you're in a story mission, it says it will teleport you after 30 seconds of inactivity, so basically just don't do anything and it takes you to entrance.  There's a checkpoint right after the third crystal, so dying somehow takes you back there.  There's a small rift looking thing behind me after coming back, so wondering if there's a shortcut back there.
---
To be fair authenticators are very important code and should always be working. If legitimate access becomes impossible, your security team messed up as badly, as if they allowed illegitimate access.
---
Only bosses where you really use high toughness are xera, deimos and sh and dhuum. They are the most pressuring bosses on which I'd go for 1400-1700 maybe 1800 toughness. All other bosses are easily tankable with 1200 toughness 
---
or lower
---
Both are outdated.
---
Yeah, it's 30 seconds of inactivity then it will port you to the entrance (there's a dev comment here saying they're going to change it to move you to the last checkpoint).  There's a checkpoint right after the third crystal, so dying takes you back there.
---
I mean yeah, I guess. For me personally I don't see the big deal, it's just an elite spec after all.
---
Just means I check snowcrows whether I pick it or not, basically :D
---
That happened for a lot of new nodes.
---
I don't know what build you're running but nightmare is bis for condi mirage right now

When was that explicitly stated in the story? I know it's a popular fan theory, but it's based on the premise that Aurene can absorb enough of Kralk's energy to serve as a viable substitute.
---
Not everyone could buy it before the hotfix, that happened with previous nodes too.
---
Does it work with lb5?
---
The hotfix for that is already out.
---
I agree that map completion should be solo-able but it's cool when they make locked off areas that are only accessible during events because it makes the worlds feel less static, they just shouldn't put PoIs in them. 
---
Where was that stated?
---
Is it better to get 50 hours every other year instead of 3-4 hours every couple of months though? 
---
The Roleplay I did with my Charr Herald had him calling glint mother, he then wound up with a 'sister' and oh man, this last season of living world has just been absolute torture for the guy.  And he's a human-raised charr, too. So he's this oddly sweet kind of guy. Everyone in my party calls him a precious fluff ball even though he's still a brutal charr.  
---
I'm feeling juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust as bad as you. 
---
I love that you are saying it‚Äôs Reddit theory when people are telling you. There is the wiki as well. 
---
Cool, where do you get those weapons from? I haven't played in 2 years :)
---
I wish anet had the balls to not give any rewards for the final story instance, just leave us on the I don't know.
---
you're right. ‡≤•\_‡≤•
---
It does matter for an achievement Hunter like me. I need all the achievements. Well, time to contact an Anet Employee and ask him/her nicely to do fracs with me. Does it have to be Siren's Reef, or just any frac?

https://www.redbull.com/int-en/guild-wars-2-living-world-season-4-episode-5-interview-preview?linkId=62090011 - "Entitled ‚ÄòAll or Nothing‚Äô, it represents the conclusion to Season 4 of the game‚Äôs Living World episodes, which have regularly added new storylines and content to the world of Tyria."
---
For Teenager Aurene?
---
I think it'd be neat to use NPCs/books to introduce their presence early so players are aware of them, but after all are introduced then they all get released at once for game balance reasons.
---
Yea, I noticed my rocket boots went about a third the normal distance with slippery on.
---
Not really, considering Anet has no problem with payoff, once a difficult situation has been mastered. Martin, for all his talent at dissecting characters, seems unwilling to build them back up.
---
I am interested in this.
---
nightmare was another one i was considering, but this post was only directed at these 2
---
it's a TORCH skin, so it's not like it really matters. former musician btw
---
Why not?
---
One day, umans
---
Then silvary
---
The next one is obviously Kormir so Joko can finally achieve the dream of save the Elonian culture with a band of undead idols.
---
It's the only logical course
---
Keep in mind stability negates the effect. During difficult non-combat situations, you can just swap a utility for something that gives you and/or others stability. The instability also gives you a huge duration increase on it, too.
---
When can we start crafting the new legendary longbow
---
I'd settle for a Quaggan combat tonic.
---
Then I'd go with renegade, the amount of powerdamage mirage does is not high enough for berserker to be worth it iirc
---
You need to visit the two NPCs on the airship above the quest where you gather supplies and harmonise with the Zephyrites! They talk about how silly the rivalry between the Pact Members and the Corsairs is and how they feel they should hate each other too out of solidary. Then they come up with faking it and the lines are hilarious! At work atm, gonna try to get a screen cap when at home \^\^
---
Don‚Äôt want an interface focused game
---
Confusion and torment exist
---
Pick one
---
my only problem with the new fractal is final part on the ship and shit fiesta of condi spam and interrupts, oh and skill aoes that can't be blocked must have to be dodged. It's not fun when I have to cleanse chill and slow for the 5th fcking time in the last 10 seconds but have no skills left to do so. And that was T1. Can't even fcking imagine it on T4 and don't want to actually try it. 
---
Visually and story wise I love it. I also like the theme last two fractals seems to have in common which is treasure hunting/tomb raiding. Love to see more it has nice adventures feel I really enjoy. 
---
Elite specs are great, but there has to be a stopping point. I could see maybe one more elite spec for each profession, but that's probably it. If the only thing you're playing is the story and skipping everything else the game offers (open world, fractals,raids, achievements, PvP, etc), you're better off buying single player RPGs and playing those in between living world.
---
I have a Sprite
---
It'll be okay once they remove it from Cliffside and once people get used to it; seems like it takes a bit of finesse to get the controls down. Might also be nice if they clean up some of the mobility skills which are presently hampered quite badly by the effect.
---
There are several fracs where it should be removed espacially in cms + future cms. But there are also many fracs where i think its much fun
---
Looks like a candidate for Thor cos play, pre-Stormbreaker Thor.  
---
That's just how the mafia works.
---
Man cannot become a god. Please stop this nonsense or Dominion will take care of you, you damn heretic!
---
[There's a dev comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/adzz5l/spoiler_soft_lock_in_last_instance_of_the_episode/edlhksx/) that /stuck will be updated to take you back to the last checkpoint in that instance.
---
&gt;Looking into this. In the mean time, you can use the /stuck command and then die, retry from checkpoint and you should be able to move forward.
---
&gt;/stuck currently takes you to the beginning of the instance, and I will be looking into changing it so it instead takes you to the most recent checkpoint.
---
Yeah but there is something off about this. There is definitely more to this. I have my theories but I don't have enough evidence to talk about those now.
---
Yeah, 1 last night. Not bad, still. 
---
no it's not a good thing, not everything that's hard is really challenging..in this case it's just frustrating to deal with
---
and if stability negates it then it's pointless because instead of having a mesmer port you around you just spam stability
---
it's just an annoying time-waster
---
Why couldn‚Äôt it have been Taimi? üò≠ /s
---
Next LS we go to cantha and look for the Dragonballs to revive Aurene.
---
I think you will find that the question is actually WHY is Marjory and Kasmeer. 
---
I noticed that too 
---
I think they are still following Kralkatorrik like we told them too back in PoF. They could be in the mists fighting with Glint or they could be on their own mission to find another solution to stopping Kralkatorrik. 
---
so there's 2 times you will go into the catacombs, the first time with be for the story, you will talk to the ghost dwarf and he will have a purple plate next to him to use to get in. you will go in fight the creature and continue on your quest.  
---
the second time you will go there is once you complete the 2 meta events, get the top and bottom half  of light of deldrimor plate and combine them, after that you will go and talk to the same dwarf again. This time he will give you a buff to find hidden treasures.   
---
From here you will go to the light yellow room run to the end get a purple plate.  
---
Go to the purple room fight the creature again and get the blue plate.  
---
Go to the blue room do a small jump puzzle get the green plate.  
---
Go to the green room the treasure room and you've got the point of interest
---
Don't know why you got downvotes.
---
As far as I'm aware of it really only happens with weavers at arkk.
---
&gt;At what point in the story did we switch from "killing elder dragons is bad" back to being big game hunters?
---
When Kralkatorrik started to actively attack us and eat up the Mists which would basically destroy the universe? 
---
CAN we kill Kralk though? I thought the whole deal was that we needed Aurene to absorb all his magic so we don't blow up Tyria, and well, now we don't have Aurene....
---
Ah, but then it would raise questions like : **WHAT** are Marjory and Kasmeer.
---
SAME. I was like "Ugh, that was really moving, but the little jingle is going totally kill the mood" but then to my pleasant surprise- silence.
---
An empty hole. Thats how the commander feels. 
---
:c
---
trying not to think about it...
---
She's SO GOOD at making me feel so bad.
---
How exactly do you market and grow the game through LS. You can barely monetize them considering they are free updates. 
---
I'm not so sure Glint meant Kralkatorrik saw an actual vision like the Commander interpreted. Her wording seemed more like he imagined such a thing and feared it.
---
Point A just seems very weird because there is zero reason why any Elder Dragon wouldn't try to absorb other types of magic.
---
lionguard atrix √≥_√≤
---
In a word yes. Remember back in season 3 after we killed Mordremoth magic went mental leading us to bloodstone fen. Now that was Mordremoth just imagine killing Kralkatorrik with the power of 2 dead dragons, a fallen god and obviously his own power. Thats why we had a plan to kill Kralkatorrik and let Aurene take his magic to avoid oblivion. 
---
Ran T4‚Äôs (non CM) last night and didn‚Äôt even notice boon overload on shattered 100. We had max boons on all of us and didn‚Äôt see hp go lower than normal. The description also says increased incoming strike damage so perhaps a lot of damage isn‚Äôt ‚Äústrike‚Äù based. I can see fractals with lots of smaller mobs that do strike based damage hurting more. 
---
I was one of the people who anticipated that episode 6 would be *'dealing with the fallout of our attack's*
---
So I'm not wrong, yet.
---
One of the episode previews mentioned that the star of the show was the ambient dialogue, not the actual story, and I agree. The story wasn't bad by any means, but it's not a groundbreaking story. The ending was emotional and hit hard, but it was an ending that **should** have been expected, given prior hints and out of game influences.
---
They absolutely nailed the ambiance in the map though. Even just standing by and listening to NPC dialogue is a blast, and I'd say the emotional impact of the episode is not just because of our feelings towards Aurene, but also because of how solid the voice acting and music (or timely use of music or lack thereof) was. 
---
Population is not the problem.
---
The moment the t2 legendary shield came out i went for it, took me a week  :p
---
Ye this episodes writing really has an impact. Been browsing reddit all day reading theories. 
---
Why do you NEED map completion though, if you don't want to put the effort to get it?
---
Didn‚Äôt seem race specific when she talked to my Charr
---
Reappearing in sequels!
---
Just because I adopted a baby and hung out with it sporadically over the course of a year (and an invasion of a foreign nationals during which she got captured and I got killed) doesn't mean I get to throw it into a hurricane and assume it will be able to fly ;)
---
If you're a Herald, this is the episode for you. This story was done right. They also gave us spears from mounts, although they are just Special Key spam, they felt great. Hopefully we'll get more.
---
And Rox. I didn't see her anywhere.
---
If you spread them out you have to cast less of them which cuts down the time between them. It was happening to me too, but was easy once I spread them out.
---
You can get them after you have completed the collection for all exotic dragonblood weapons. 
---
I definitely am not opposed to LS but it seems like expansions are the only way to introduce large scale features and replayable content. Things like Races, Elite Specs, or potentially new systems like mounts. I can't imagine they'd be able to ship elite specs for all classes in one episode and I don't think the fanbase would positively respond to them coming out incrementally over multiple episodes ( with 3 months in between). 
---
Thanks =) 
---
She got a lot of development in the last season. I don't blame you though. I really hated Taimi in previous season, the cranky genious who get everything right, because she's soo clever. Ugh. But she got a lot better in PoF and LS4.
---
yes pls :D
---
I'll have to see the changes to instability that were just rolled out but I'm not entirely eager to start farming fracs.
---
My Maraca Choya Pinata definitely lightened the mood significantly.
---
full commanders,harriers and even more so minstrel are defensive sets if you feel you need the extra toughness/heals while tanking..so basically commanders is more tanky, harriers has healing and minstrel is for afk mode
---
there is no tanking in fractals so that's mainly for raids
---
for fractals it depends if you consider the potions or not cuz those give some extra precision and boon duration: specifically 225 precision and 225 boon duration which are 15% crit chance and 15% bd
---
so basically in fractals you use the meta build(regular variant) except you replace all trinkets with berserker(which is -226 precision,close enough)
---
since you're on a budget i wouldn't bother with armor and just keep the commander pants, same with the concentration sigil on sword tbh(but you can take impact to minmax)
---
the whole druid CA thing also only applies to raids and only if you go for insane healing power( lots of harrier and/or minstrel)
---
tl;dr regular meta build, berserker trinkets instead of assassin
---
Yeah this one had so many nice nods.
---
Awakened Sylvari (SAY WHAAAA :O)
---
Rhoban and his Charr assistant banters.
---
Stupid Sexy Charr Cook.
---
Troopmarshal Dragon Kebab joke which turned out to be true (But wrong dragon)
---
And my favourite the political discussion with Dredge Sage.
---
You sure you don‚Äôt have Scarlet in disguise there?
---
You craft the "normal" exotic dragonsblood weapon, buy the Chasing Tale item to the Forge Master, do 3 achivements (basicvally kill stuff with  a Sword if you wanted to craft the Sword) and then you get can craft the ascended weapon
---
Fooooo!
---
No, you only need to craft the exotic GS to craft the ascended dragonsblood GS.
---
&gt; Afflicted. I'm not 100% sure about this one. To me it seemed more potent than before. The bonus resistance duration is nice but there aren't that many places to get the resistance from that fit the meta. 
---
Arena net doesn't balance around the "meta" which is sad.
---
&gt; . And I imagine this will force full clears on chaos and uncategorized since you can't skip enemies on the jumping parts because they can shread you so fast from behind(or you need to spam chrono stealth everywhere) . I dont think anyone wanted slower fractals. 
---
Again arena net doesn't balance around skips which is also sad.
---
Their idea of a fractal/dungeon run is simply kill everything that can be killed. The whole game is against speedrunning and try harding and you can clearly see that with every balance patch and decision they make about the end game content. 
---
Just accept this fact and "enjoy" the game.
---
I gave up on getting anything challenging after wing 6. 
---
First, if you're trying to mock me with such retarded question as
---
\&gt;  How old are you?
---
I hardly see a reason to argue with you. But since you made some effort, okay:
---
You're not a prophet and you don't know their LS scheluding. They can start LS 5 3 months after S4E6 or they will start it in Fall with new expac. Both possibilities could be there.
---
You're talking about marketing sense yet ignoring their low profit from gem sales. If you think they're gonna let it sink for another year, you're delusional.
---
Again, you're talking about marketing like you know shit, yet I'll destroy you with single fact: They announced PoF expac 2 months before they released it. Yeah, right. 2 months before release. We still have 9 months till Fall right now. You shouldn't rush and say they're not planning expac for this year because you didn't hear anything about it yet.
---
You use the tool they posted, put your gw2 API key in. In the browse tab you can sort by a multitude of options from buy prices to acquired by karma. I like to go to the Analyse tab to search for the cheapest skins currently in the market. For example, I put 5g in as the desired minimum unlock value and all the skins that I haven't unlocked that are below 5g pop up for me
---
I mean, I felt like big maps could only come with xpacs, but just look at the size of Thunderhead Peaks compared to earlier maps like Bloodstone Fen. If they take focus away from expansions, they might have more time/resources for LS stuff and up the ante in that department.
---
ANet has always been about pushing the boundary on what they can do and how they can make it happen. This could be another experiment. I'm intrigued to say the least.
---
It's a good thing that they refresh some content, but it doesn't make that content appear as new and exciting to me. I've done it too many times already.
---
Elder wood farm?
---
Wasn't that in previous epizode though?
---
I‚Äôve had player chatter turned off since it was an option, and only remembered that was a thing when my friend‚Äôs character gloated ‚Äòmine, all mine!‚Äô As we left the instance and they go the achievement loot.
---
The Zephyrite choir is probably one of the best soundtrack I've ever listened.
---
Right! I forgot to add that. That was great!
---
is there any wiki link with crafting steps ? .. i dont understand it properly
---
I‚Äôm stuck trying to figure out what a ‚ÄúHeroic Font‚Äù is...
---
Wow, I never would have guessed
---
Hoi ;3 good art as always\~
---
No, there are some lines when you are at the forge where Taimi is talking to Marjory through the communicator. But I don't know if you have to do something for that. They just started talking before I went into the last story instance.
---
Thanks a ton. I might try out nightmare and renegade if i get the opportunity, but it sounds like nightmare for now.
---
A dev responded to this over on the forums:
---
"Marjory and Kasmeer stayed behind in Elona to help evacuate civilians in response to Kralkatorrik's Rift invasions. There are a couple scenes that touch on that. Mesmer portals OP for evacuations."
---
Lots of T7 mats, something like ~25 Spiritwood Plank, ~50 Deldrimor Steel Ingot, and ~20 Elonian Leather Square if I recall. You can buy these on the TP, but they are usually cheaper to craft.
---
The only hard timegate is the Mini Holographic Zinn required for the first collection, which has its own collection that takes a minimum of 12 days to complete.
---
Stability doesnt block the slippery effect. At least it didnt for us
---
What can you do with it?
---
https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-76158  Here ya go, this will help immensely. 
---
tl;dr - 
---
This recipe expects you to craft 86 items that you can only craft once a day:
---
5x Charged Quartz Crystal
---
51x Lump of Mithrillium
---
30x Spool of Thick Elonian Cord 
---
Northwest in thunderhead keep there is a little glowing light.
---
I'd certainly be pissed if charr were my sworn enemies, and then I came back as a ghost to find myself surrounded by humans being led by a charr that was cosplaying as me.
---
Renegade is the better option of those two, but you need to take a Malice Sigil and Chaos traits along with it, otherwise you don't have enough condition duration.
---
That build used to be good, but numerous nerfs to it killed it so Nightmare is the rune of choice now.
---
In the first Hall after arriving you can jump up and out of the intended map area.

Also there is a bunny on cliffs above dredge oil rigs. If you follow it.... ;-)
---
None of what you wrote are directly mentioned. You just sound like yet another drama queen that wants confirmation. There are exactly two things known about the near future. 
---
1. LWS5 is planned to be in tandem with LWS4. 
---
2. Anet wont hold finished features back for the next expansion but instead release them with LW updates. 
---
Other than that, everything else is unknown. We dont know if we get more expansions. We dont know if GW3 is in developement. We dont know if anet will release a gw1 remake for smartphones. All we know are the two things above. Period.
---
With either, you shouldn't be shattering honestly
---
Also "last" episode when there was a line on the 6th anniversary picture saying something like "get ready for the next half of season 4" after episode 3 was released. This post is wrong from start to finish.
---
Hmm we did lvl 78 2nd try.. used reflects and druid staff...
---
That‚Äôs from a third party, not Anet directly. We have another article from MMORPG that refers to this episode as the ‚Äúpenultimate ‚Äú episode of Season 4, too.
---
Something worth mentioning is that DH has incredibly strong burst damage, and it's only in longer fights that it starts to lag behind other dps (and even then only a bit). In content like fractals, burst is more important than sustained damage, and you see even hardcore groups using it thanks to the high burst coupled with great utility.
---
They definitely have the benefit of the doubt from me. I do think this update raised the bar but map creation is a matter of asset allocation. Features take months of design, balance, and implementation. I just don't want them falling back on the idea that new episodic story content is the primary method they should use to sustain and grow the game. 
---
She's involved with one of the meta events on the map. The one in the south by the oil fields. 
---
i think i would quit the game.
---
While it doesn't have e-mail notification (afaik), it's still pretty useful. Just subscribe to the stuff you're looking for and check in once a day. If that's too much, check in at least every tuesday/friday, that's when stuff **usually** rotates in/out. (Although, sometimes like with the new years sale, stuff might rotate in/out on a daily basis)
---
Human. Would have chosen chart if I was a furry. 
---
Enter hidden rooms (you do one in story) to get some chests (unid gear, maybe map currency and the new serpentine upgrade for trinkets, which is required for new weapon skins) and one PoI.
---
Jewels are fine for now. If anything, we need the damn zealot event in vaabi changed. That shit failed everytime so far for me. FML
---
I had a Hobbit Hunter in Lord of the Rings Online that I wanted to sorta-recreate in GW2, so I made an Asura Ranger.
---
Plants are nice.
---
I was just asking as I‚Äôm trying to understand better. I started playing in 2016 for a couple months, then started back a few months ago. Because in PoF if the commander dies, it‚Äôs confusing since my characters had already ‚Äòdied‚Äô hundreds of times before that point.

---
This patch made the *dredge* likeable. Think about that.
---
Thanks. Man I‚Äôm getting tired of Anet‚Äôs cryptic hints. I had tried torches, commune hero points in central and PoF maps, the oil pumps in the new map, slag pit, the pit where you fight the oil boss, the catacombs, and really just all over and couldn‚Äôt figure out what the heck that hint meant.
---
Same for me last night, but when I logged in this morning it was available.
---
That is a very fair point! Again, all this falls back to what I've seen many people say on this subreddit: it would be nice if ANet gave us a bit more info than just "LS5 right after LS4." Expansions were how they delivered everything. LS season access was based on which xpac you bought. Maps were designed with certain xpac masteries in mind.
---
There are a lot of questions still. A lot of important questions. I hope once this episode has had a chance to sink in, they'll say "alright, let's discuss the future" in a more thorough manner.
---
Having a diverse set of characters and somewhat fitting to the profession. 
---
My guess is that anet was not happy with the developement speed of the next expac so they push some of it into the LWS5. I dont know why else they would specify their "no more content holdback for expacs". I cant wait for that one.
---
Sylvari can be purple and glow in the dark
---
No kidding. They were so fleshed out!
---
There was even an Inquest member in the final instance who seemed sympathetic.
---
&gt; "Rata Primus was a wakeup call for me."
---
And I typically *hate* Inquest.
---
Goddamit, thank you. 
---
This has never happened for me before, but it's happened several times since the patch when I played last night:  I've noticed that sometimes when I dismount and then try to remount, nothing happens.  Typically there is a 2 or 3 second cooldown before you can remount, but on several occasions the cooldown persisted for around double that time.  All of this out of combat and environmental effects, of course.
---
But that's what fractals are, daily repeats of the same content. I don't want to go through a same story for Nth time. I do fractals daily and I'm not doing them for the story. Maybe they should keep the story fractals off the rotation and do it like dungeons where the story is separate from the dailies.
---
Agreed.  I didn't time it once I realized I only had 6 pours, but I don't think it was more than 20 or 30 seconds.
---
Ich mag Quaggan nicht. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
She's also the female human and several other minor characters over the years, FWIW.  One of the more involved VAs.
---
I‚Äôm definitely not an expert, but here‚Äôs what I learned after 40 or so runs that made Istan as stress-free as possible:
---
Since your primary goal for Istan is to get as much stuff as possible, your primary goal is to tag as many mobs as humanly possible, as fast as humanly possible, since enemies evaporate in seconds and are hard to see in the swirling glare of players and effects - look for classes that use weapons that create AOEs; I like Necro‚Äôs staff wells. Even better are Guardian staff‚Äôs BIG, fairly rapid-fire cone attacks. Warrior‚Äôs whirlwind thing on axes is also good, but there are plenty more, and basically every class has at least something that works in this category. 
---
After that be sure to be geared with runes or skills that give you reliable access to Swiftness - at some point you probably will get tagged by an add-on mob, which will prevent you from mounting, and when this happens the Zerg will instantly leave you in the dust. Losing the Zerg = missing rewards, so when that happens Swiftness will let you get distance and Mount back to the Zerg ASAP. Plus there‚Äôs a lot of running around on foot between chests, as you know, so Swiftness helps there, too. 
---
Survivability is also semi-important, as you can‚Äôt always count on someone getting you up if you suck up a big attack and go down - usually some kind soul will do so, but if they don‚Äôt and the Zerg leaves you behind, you‚Äôre essentially done (or at the least will have your rewards cut, possibly drastically). If you‚Äôre not a Reaper Necro, and are healing constantly as a passive, use runes or food that give you either extra Endurance (for dodges) and/or something that gives you added heal. 
---
Hope this helps. 
---
That was astonishing tbf. I almost cried when they opened up the passage in the last scenario. I was so happy then joined us in the fight.
---
On new map NW of Maiden's veil poi, there is a friendly rabbit will spwan at certain timer. You could chase it all the way to bottom of waterfall, and then it will take revenge on you by bouncing you to death. Took some time for me and my friend to kill it. No ap or special rewards, probably it's a meme.
---
THANK YOU! You're the only person who's been able to actually answer the question for me.
---
I am interested as well. Hoping you're NA
---
With 10k AP you probably have 1000s of hours, I know because I have 14k AP. It's reasonable for our brains to want to seek new stimulation elsewhere. I used to feel obligated to log on when I had an active guild (RIP), but slowly I realized I had no duty to play a video game I didn't want to and stopped feeling guilty about it. So like you, I mostly come by every few months to enjoy the awesome living story and new map then go and enjoy another game like Dead Cells or Slay the Spire, or mists forbid one of my other hobbies in my free time. 
---
I never thought I needed it, but it's great! Reduces the times I have to find a bank NPC to check this or that mat's amount in my storage.
---
do you know where to meet the spirit belitrea at a heroic font?
---
It's not about racism...but speciesism.
---
Thanks for informing me about this, i will open a ticket with their support center :).
---
One thing I should mention as well is that my character actually says something even when the instance is led by someone else.
---
Im surprised to see that happening. Replicated the story and it happened again.
---
I enjoyed that *blow*.
---
Founder of Ebonhold too.
---
Thanks for the answer :) guess i will buy the expansions since they are on sale right now.
---
As for the LS seasons, will probably invest in soms gems the moment i reach level 80.
---
That's really interesting! Do you remember what was said? I'm wondering if the same line just goes to the instance owner if running solo.
---
:D No problem!
---
That shook me.  The human female VA really nailed it (and apparently all the others did as well).
---
What will happen in two years when people will want to complete and nobody will be on the map ?
---
My toon after Aurene uses her skill to stop the Brandstorm: "Aurene...branded them."
---
Then dialogues continue as usual, with the other player saying it. Note that I was standing the closest to Aurene, possibly triggering it.
---
maybe our shadowstones stored magic and leyline anomalies can unbrand her!
---
she got along well with Pyre, even helped him break the shackles of the Flame Legion.
---
It‚Äôs interesting when you think about the whole Joko theory, that since she consumed Jokos magic she will be immortal as well... interesting theory. I originally thought it was a reach of an argument, until I remembered after the first episode that Zaphira met Aurene and started exclaiming ‚ÄúI feel jokos presence‚Äù

They are [worth](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/laurels) about 66s per laurel atm.

Now that‚Äôs got some sax appeal.

Go slightly west of the Thunderhead Keep (like right as you enter it to through the bridge on the left) and you should see the Heroic Font. Bring a Vision Crystal with you too!
---
This is an MMO story it's not supposed to make me feel hopeless 
---
It's a GW1 reference, nice find
---
Still gotsta fight inside the mists.
---
This first attempt was basically how we fought Zhaitan.  
---
Second attempt will be inside the mists, as we still have the tracker on him, so we can find him. (Guess where Aurene may have ended up).  
---
Once we do that, who knows where we get spat out.
---
When picking up Mines from Canach for the Defense Event:
---
"I call *that* one 'Rytlock Brimstone'. It's temperamental, but effective."
---
I agree - this is super uncool.  I have 1 more POI on Thunderhead Peaks and it's locked behind a mini puzzle requiring items dropped from events.  I want to log in and do map completion when I want to, not log in and sit around for 20 minutes waiting for an event so I can do map completion on someone else's time.
---
I'd like to see map completion be its own thing, independent from events, leveling, builds, etc.  I'm not at all clear on how hiding POIs behind event chains brings value to players and enhances the game experience.  Seriously folks...
---
Thank you! I was hoping someone would get that final battle track. It‚Äôs so its epic and haunting at the same time.
---
Well the Commander will definitely go rush hot-headed onto Kralkatorrik, it's so much into personality of our PC.
---
What weapons are these, and were do we purchase them?  I assume we buy the recipes right?
---
I'm actually seeing other videos that don't have this ray of light effect. Is it like this with all of the classes for you?
---
Advantage of the new Social Awkwardness: Support chronos can now push their allies into their wells.

Master piece &lt;3
---
My mini IMMEDIATELY climbed on glint‚Äôs corpse. I mean I know lynxes are cats but come on!
---
I will probably make a post here myself but the thing I‚Äôve noticed, and I‚Äôm like really new, of course, so it‚Äôs not relevant to me persay but it does kinda bother me a little if it‚Äôs true, is looking at wvw and pvp for example, it looks like minimal rewards/skins were actually ever added since the game released. Yeah, I see the pvp vendor has 1 set for each expansion, but that‚Äôs 1 pvp set ( armour type specific ofc ) being added every 2 years, ish?
---
That seems kinda ridiculous for me, when the endgame is being praised as fashion wars, to have pvp and wvw game modes not produce any real rewards after a handful of sets. 
---
I think the concept of the LWs is fine it‚Äôs just hard for me to understand why all a top 150 player also only gets a title, and unless you break into a new tier in a new season, you also... only get a title. 
---
There isn‚Äôt even a fancy page that shows previous season results for yourself so you can look back on previous accomplishments. 
---
It just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me why they don‚Äôt add the odd pieces as rewards to things like PvP ranks, or you don‚Äôt get some sort of brownie points for tryharding a WvW this week that your world ranked #1 in . 
---
Am I incorrect in this assumption? This is just what I‚Äôve seen from the past 3 weeks of playing, but I‚Äôve really been enjoying catchup.
---
I was wondering the same thing. I can finally sleep tonight.
---
human, i created my gw1 main's direct descendant 
---
I did t4 underground and we spent 15 minutes to go up the ramp after hacking the mechanism and 3 minutes fighting the boss. While it seems like a fun inestability, it is obvious they didn't even test it. Not only going up is a pain, when you do, you sometimes get catapulted so you go down and die. Terrible bugs, completely avoidable with minor testing.
---
After that, doing the door thing was a pain as well. Worst part: stability doesn't affect the inestability. So, why do you give stability a boost if it is useless?? My guess is that stability is supposed to work, but then again, they didn't even test it a little.
---
Why would i not shatter if i can instantly get all my clones back up?
---
It's just the name of the place/element actually :p it's called a Heroic Font and it's pretty easy to discover if you do the northen meta. Bring a Vision Crystal too!
---
That he will wear badass eye-patch next episode.
---
Kralkatorrik the Big Boss.
---
Wait, where?!
---
Depends on how long your break was but for me taking one of my level 80s through PoF (the newer expansion) helped for me. You get a mount and I found it a very fun but hard enough so you had to relearn your character. 
---
I had a similar issue with camera shake. In the final battle after all the crystal business, the camera shake started slowly oscillating more and more, until the screen was continuously flipping 180 degrees. I somehow managed to stay alive while simultaneously disabling the camera shake from options. This solved the problem.
---
Char say victory or death. The switch was seemless
---
Yeah but then how is Aurene any different than Glint? rofl
---
Awesome, ty. Some of the exotic wep skins are also tied to achievements, like the Godswalk Enchiridion. Does anyone know if you unlock the skin, do you get credit towards achievement too?
---
TO CANTHA!! 
---
\&gt;!I'm assuming you have not compelled the newest living world yet.!&lt;
---
I did not read the entire post, but give it a week or two and a new/updated meta will evolve, for example, resistance not being available in the meta builds is because the meta builds didn't care for resistance before, now they might. Same with the stability needs for slippery slope; having stab wasn't important before; you would just dodge the knockbacks/stuns, or use a stunbreak, so stab wasn't required. Now it might be useful (dwarf road, guardian shout/mantra)
---
I have not encountered the invisible spawns you seem to be angry about, so I can't speak to those.
---
&gt;Imagine if Anet forced your group to have a sPvP match before they can enter fractals.
---
The funny thing is GW1 forced you to have PvP matches a few times in the story.
---
Clearly people should just learn to use their *reveal* skills
---
or dragon stand poi/vista
---
The Sylvari race is anthropomorphic, but unlike many anthropomorphic fantasy races it has a rather unique lore. I enjoy the concept of them being a very new race. And the high customizability in terms of skin/hair/glow is great. 
---
Lok'tar ogar brother! May the eternal sun shine upon thee.
---
I only did the new frac on T1 since it was a daily rec, but I disliked it for how long the mechanics were.
---
I feel anet is going the direction of "long frac = good frac" with the last few releases. Shattered Observatory at least had the excuse of being the 3rd and final part of a story chain, and given the build up and the circumstance around it, despite it being long, I feel it's justified and make it unique.
---
However with the introduction of Deepstone and Twilight Oasis, it's just a long slough, and now with this latest one, long tedious mechanics, followed by a boss that has multiple phrases... ugh.
---
I like Arkk because it meant something to finally get to him and defeat him after a chain of events and the phrases, but not every boss or fractal need to be like Arkk. Geez.
---
I was so :O when i noticed them. They look so cool! And Joko Stronger than Zhaitan confirmed!
---
I pulled out my choir bell and rung it the entire walk over.
---
A recent episode mentioned Orr and Trahearne. 
---
Taimi recalls something Trahearne told her...
---
Yay, cool.  Nice to see that they haven‚Äôt completely forgotten about him. 
---
Problem: Taimi never met Trahearne. :/
---
Towards the end of LW2, Taimi said that she‚Äôd like to meet Trahearne. The PC said they were too busy, some other time. He was preparing the attack on Mordremoth and by the end of LW2, Trahearne vanished. If anyone knew all that about Trahearne, it would be the PC since it‚Äôs quite obvious that they had a well established relationship. 
---
While some of the lore is delivered through the personal story, the majority of "map lore" is found by engaging in dynamic events and speaking to npcs. Heart NPCs and scouts in particular tend to give a good overview of the area.
---
social awkwardness, slippery and inability to shutdown other player's cosmetic and spell effects is the reason I stopped playing this game. I really don 't like open world content in new maps its just a mindless zerg fest with pressing left click. I used to do high level fractals and with social awkwardness and other bullshit just made the game crap, the entire thing about mmo is being in a team and supporting each other. I can't even drop warrior banner properly now.
---
They should just remove this crap and I really don't understand whose idea was this instability.
---
Can we just have some simple dungeons with themed gear sets and fun story?
---
I am tired of all these shitty currencies and infusion and fusions and whatever crap these days fractals have. Fractal is a nightmare for new players and new user onboarding is ass in fractals if a player accidentally checks out Fractal NPC they are in for a rude awakening.
---
Seeing how he said his work will be over in 4 hours and his post is 3 hours ago (at least for me) and it is currently 5pm in continental EU, I'm going to go out on a limb and guess he's in EU, at least geographically. No idea which server though.
---
In general, I like having a diverse character list in terms of Genders and races, Usually 50/50 male female, trying to not have dupes of the same race/gender combo usually as well
---
I just ''happened'' To fall in love with Engineer down the line, which ended up being my Asura, I liked the whole combo with small  character with a bunch of gadgets, Who says you cant make a big impact just cus you're small? =D *drops a Big Ol' Bomb*
---
Reminds me of the FF14 Fate system
---
There you would often have two groups of people/mobs fight each other and like halfway complete the event (both groups would spawn infinitly though, so it really doesnt matter too much
---
Note that Ep5 was likely finished much earlier than the actual release because of Wintersday, meaning that we already could be like 3 weeks into the next release.
---
In a story instance. Right where you first find Aurene. Caithe even comments on it.
---
I don't share most of your thoughts. Slippery slope though.... it sure as hell hasn't been tested at all. Did t4 and it was hell. Going up the rump was ridiculous hard as momentum doen't help you at all, and you need to rely on movement skills or dodge... yet dodging with slippery slope on a ramp is bugged and it won't do anything, and suddenly catapult you with varying strenght. We spent 15 minutes trying to get up a ramp and beign catapulted up, down, to the sides, back again, etc, etc. Ultimately we made a thief teleport up and clear by himself so we could GG.
---
It is ridiculous.  I can asure you 100% no one even tested running slippery slope on that fractal. It is frustrating and boring. Don't get me wrong, I think the inestability has a lot of potential, but the implementation is shameful. Honestly, it isn't working as expected, there is no momentum, dodges make yo stay in place and later get catapulted, etc,etc,etc.... This is a failure on the develepment and QA team, which is rare because anet has great developers and artists, and everything, except support and marketing.
---
I am terribly dissapointed with slippery slope implementation, its frutrating and unresponsive. I was hoping it to be real fun, but it isn't.
---
The fact that Charr are objectively superior to all other races.
---
furries
---
Absolutely; I think the main difference now is that the PC has rarely gone rushed into a fight because of vengeance. The PC has always been one to act, whether it's part of a plan or part of a reaction, but it's always been based on duty. PC almost always fights because their duty is to protect Tyria.
---
This could be one of the first times that the PC goes after an enemy for revenge. Kralk needs to be taken care of, but if the PC turns into a Braham-lite, letting their anger and frustration lead over keeping a calm head, it *could* be a nice change of pace from the usual PC-antics.
---
Also, if Aurene takes the Mordremoth route of resurrection over the Joko route, it could make the final fight more interesting. How do you fight Kralk if Aurene is trying to take control of his mind/body? If it does go that route and Aurene just basically inhabits Kralk, how easy would it be to truly trust her when, by all appearances, she **is** Kralk? 
---
This is all speculation of course, and with how recent Joko's death has been it's likely they just take the classic resurrection route. Still, the circumstances of Aurene's birth has to lend some credence to the possibility that Aurene learns how to use Mordremoth's abilities.
---
Now that's an reason I can get behind! For the legions!
---
Started out that way - I think as time went on, she became a better villain, but jeez the way she was originally presented.
---
&gt;Following the trend we've seen so far, this release will come to us in about 70 to 100 days. To make an educated guess, we'll be seeing the season finale of Season 4 somewhere between march 16th up to april 16th
---
I want to say nearly every season 4 episode was released more than 100 days after the last.
---
&gt; the use of Gwen as the ghostly messenger who wasn't specifically named.
---
I did *not* notice this, holy shit! love it.
---
Wait, there's special Herald dialogue or something?
---
We don‚Äôt know for sure if Aurene is gone, or what she did to Kralk, or if this was part of Glint‚Äôs plan all along. 
---
You don‚Äôt need any toughness for Dhumm. He doesn‚Äôt it the tank hard. 
---
The twin largos tho, they can hit quite hard when you split and your Druid is kiting. 
---
I get what you mean but i really really loved paragon in gw1. Between seeing npcs named paragon that have spears equipped and throwing the damn things myself i kept thinking how much i wanted paragons to be a class in gw2 :(
---
A good example of how I feel this ought to be done is Joko‚Äôs harem in the Desolation. You can grab the POI by walking up to the gate, but the actual interior (which is really cool and funny) is locked behind an event. Also Zamorro‚Äôs Lair in Vabbi. 
---
Stability does nothing to it.
---
The only two issues I had the entire time were some dialogues not being voiced and a buggy interaction with the final oil trail to get the resonance discs south of the dredge encampment. Everything else was perfectly working with no bugs, I'm super happy they could do so this patch &lt;3
---
Did T1 with just two others yesterday (so three total). Took a couple of attempts for the final boss, but seemed OK. A little frustrating with all of the Condi spam, but we focussed the adds. They only spawn every 25%, or at least seemed to. So kill adds, focus boss, repeat 4 times, victory. 
---
Oh, and stand in the green circle. If there's just the "victim" in it they basically die, but the damage is shared out if everyone is in it so everyone lives. Not sure how that would play with social awkwardness...
---
Overall, the final fight was a little annoying with a power reaper, harrier renegade and Condi berserker. But wasn't that bad, and other comps would probably come out better. 
---
I'm human sometimes

I have a power warrior/spellbreaker geared with asc trinkets and some asc amor pieces that dropped during fractals. Is that enough to begin raiding? Also, is power warrior/spellbreaker need in every raid?
---
I love the fact that I wasn't the only one running around then new map with the arctic explorer outfit. Immersion &lt;3
---
Ah I see. Thanks for solving the mystery for us.
---
It‚Äôs the killer bunny from Monty Python‚Äôs Holy Grail :)
---
&gt; it was an ending that should have been expected, given prior hints and out of game influences.
---
See, people say this all the time, but it's a huge trope when there's a vision of something negative, the hero goes to fight that vision and the outcome becomes different. The hints weren't unsubtle at all, but it wasn't a given that the ending would actually turn out that way, exactly because we've been conditioned to think of that trope.
---
It does directly influence the replayability of the map. If mapcompletion is too easy and too rewarding, it's all people do. No metas, etc. Bloodstone Fen was a great example of this pre-nerf.
---
unlike the servers
---
God forbid having to play the game to unlock things.
---
Ya. I sell basically all materials that go over 250. Otherwise I'd just have gold lying around in my storage!
---
Yeah, I noticed that. And it's amazing! I am loving it!
---
Crazy hot.
---
&gt; She did eat joko's magic. That could legit be something she could do.
---
Idk why people are crying so hard about Aurene, because let's be real here, that's exactly what is going on. Guess it doesn't take a lot to surprise the average gw2 player.
---
Awakened Sylvari? Where and how?
---
I mostly say that it was a given, since Avengers had the same situation and the vision itself was a pretty clear reference to that situation (yes, the story could have been written out prior, but rewrites are common). Considering that she also consumed Joko and Glint's discussion about Aurene "making an impossible choice" that she was initially hesitant to make. 
---
If this was Anet's first rodeo with killing a popular character, then I'd agree that it'd be a lot less of a given; but Anet's a fan of killing off popular (or at least semi-important characters). With all these hints dropped, it was way too obvious of an ending for the writers to try a switcheroo and say "HA! Just kidding! She's good, everything is fine."
---
Now, this is just in the context of this episode. There's also so many hints that Aurene is *going* to come back in the next episode or S5 in some form. 
---
Hmmm... do you think it‚Äôd be worth playing far enough to get a mount and then starting a new character?
---
That's my thought. Though the fact that Caithe couldn't sense her anymore makes me doubt.
---
It's a jumping Puzzle in Gendarran Fields.

The human female VO bugs me.. a lot. Humorless and abrasive, and it drives me insane (speaking as a female). But, this episode it seemed a bit better and a bit less "I'LL TURN THIS CAR AROUND SO HELP ME GOD" mom voice. 
---
Human cos im gay for nolan north's voice
---
"Everyone is Here!" The fact that Anet pulled so many characters we havent seen in months or years was surprising, specifically in the beginning of the last mission. Being able to talk to Kito, the Free Awakened Ambassador, an Inquest defector, heck even an Awakened Olmakahn and a group of Awakened Sylvari were surprising to see! Oh! And seeing Squad Captain Bennett again training troops in the Lyceum was refreshing
---
You do Good Work, my friend, especially for us skin whores. 
---
Oh I believe you, I've just never seen power firebrand or power renegade on sc or dt's websites.  
---
None of the results link to the [actual vendor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragonsblood_weapons) giving the skins tho.
---
No, not the PC, just a bunch of randos I think.
---
sex appeal
---
I love the trip to fight Kralk, and hearing the Olmakhan and the Sunspear talk about the cold - and they take a moment to talk about home, to try to feel warmth. Or the Awakened and the Vigil warrior talking, where the warrior was afraid to fight and saying he didn't want to die - the awakened pointed out he could have a "dolyak fall on him tomorrow" but that dying today would at least be an attempt to protect his loved ones, or something to that effect. 
---
In your opinion, which profession is the closest to the DnD Sorcerer ?
---
The part I loved was when you're going down to meet the gang for the last battle, and you see in the hallway a young freshfaced Vigil recruit sitting with his back to the wall, saying that he is terrified of dying. And an Awakened soldier next to him says, you can run and may have a dolyak fall on you tomorrow and die, you don't know. But it's not going to help your little sisters. Dying in battle to protect the world just might.
---
And just reminding the boy of his family makes him stand straighter and say yes, yes you're right. It might.
---
Oh, which games are you comparing those content launches too, hm? Let's hear them and show us how they fucked up again.
---
Oh yes, I'm against Anet even tho i have 4k hours played in this game.
---
How about you throw around even more useless stuff, just so you can write?
---
Sort of. Most MMOs to me are just get from point A to point B after which I would just quit, but GW2 is a bit of an oddball in that I think of it more as a collectathon game. Like, I'm the type of person is compelled to 100% single player RPGs all the time so for the most part GW2 keeps my interest as long as there's something I want. I pretty much already have everything I want though so these days I get enjoyment from my raid statics company. I'm at the point now where I enjoy playing with those people than the raids themselves, but I still have few raid achievements left to do so there's that too.
---
Make sure to check TP prices, occasionally they are cheaper to buy than craft.
---
For example, buying Spiritwood at buy order listing is currently cheaper than crafting it.
---
&gt; Maybe I got lucky with timing
---
That's pretty much the worst part of it. Either you get lucky and be there when it happens, or you have to plan that shit around your play time. There's only but so much */wiki et* I can take before I do something that doesn't force so much structure. 
---
Where are you seeing their sales figures? 
---
They're not going to launch a new season of LS at the same time as a new expansion. They're not going to blow their content load in one go, when prolonging engagement is one of the core goals of game development (at least, in this genre). 
---
i mean, the entire game is technically an LS1 spoiler at this point :0
---
*look of disgust*
---
Although that does annoy me very much every time I go for a legendary since I do not play WvW, I think it's a little more excusable. I don't really mind an optional extremely prestigious reward requiring you to play many aspects of the game. With that said, I think the ideal way to do it is to have legendaries for each game modes respectively (sort of like the backpacks). But that would be demanding too much from Anet.
---
oh what no way RIP
---
Simply put, no game can be designed to substitute the engagement of real life. You will always run out of direct objectives to strive for in an MMO game. You're always going to hit this wall, especially with a game that has very little vertical progression and the end game is mostly an open-ended pursuit of aesthetics. The content delivery system and the main content produced for PvE (masteries, new maps, new collections) only create longevity to game play if you're aesthetically motivated to acquire the end result. If you don't partake in others avenues of the game, it will be just that for you: A set of objectives or aesthetic imperatives that, when finished or satisfied, will leave you with no direct motivation to play if playing itself is not the objective.   
---
In this sense, your enjoyment of the game is explicitly connected to an unsustainable expectation for GW2's PvE content delivery and strategy. This is inherently and issue with your preferred play style when you don't find (or find little) fundamental enjoyment in things like the combat system interactions in PvP or WvW, which is the basis for replay-ability in context of MMO systems design, again, simply because you will always devour all the PvE content they create if you only value content for its' direct objectives. Granted, A-Net has made it clear that this content and content delivery system is what works for them and their game. If this experience is inadequate for you, you need to look at adjusting your attitude or mentality: Do you fundamentally enjoy the content, the gameplay, or do you only enjoy the underlying structure when there is new content for you to devour? If the latter is the case, I'd consider spending less time playing and wean yourself off the mechanical addiction to play something you fundamentally don't enjoy so that you spend less time frustrated and you can come back when there is content for you to devour if this is a mentality you can't recondition for yourself. The game is sub-free. There's no imperative to keep playing 24-7.
---
I loved how Logan and Canach were discussing the subtleties of circle and diamond formations, while Rytlock was all "***LINE! FIGHT!".***

---
Never ends with your spam...does it?
---
It's mostly bad in that case because this attempt at a cliffhanger would turn out to be nothing more than a cheap appeal to emotion. If she were to die and come back all within a single LS episode then it would be self-consistent and not lazy/bad in any way I can think of.
---
That said, I am no fan of the storytelling in GW2 and don't really have any interest in whether or not any characters survive any of the storyline. Even my own character is written as painfully uncool as far as I'm concerned, keeping me from being very invested. So if you ask me there's plenty of what feels like lazy/bad storytelling as it is. However, having Aurene survive her own death thanks to killing Joke is actually one of the few ways the writers can begin to redeem themselves after what felt like a truly rubbish ending to the Joko arc. Otherwise there's even less good reason for Aurene to have killed the first interesting GW villain since Scarlet.
---
I also seem to recall Anet telling us they were aware of the issue.  I've experienced it a few times with raid bosses too.  Also sometimes I get invisible time warps.  
---
This can't be the end of her story, simply because we've spent so much time building her up.  We've been interacting with her/her story in one way or another ever since we first found out about her egg in Season 2, more than 2/3 the lifespan of the game. 
---
If her story were to end here, huge chunks of the Guild Wars 2 story would have been a colossal waste of everyone's time.
---
Do you guys even know what does deus ex machina mean?
---
I swear this term is absurdly overused at every single moment that there appears to be a minimal plot twist, even if it's predictable or has been strongly hinted previously in game.
---
Oh no bby more fun pics incoming cuz Reddit dosent let me post them on a single thread
---
This happened to my GF when we played through the Knight of the Thorn quest line. She had to redo some steps because the story steps did not register as completed on her toon. Definitely needs fixed.
---
Were you playing as a sylvari? My asura character did get another response that didn't mention their wild hunts
---
I presume they do it to prevent people from getting reasonably easy zone completion rewards. As in "evil players will keep creating alts, running around the zone and competing it for rewards". This way once primary interest fades a month later you won't be able to do it without waiting for enough people to compete meta event (which will probably turn into "might compete once a day at reset if you're lucky" thing) :(
---
Had the same bug, i had Nahimic 2 (which is a sound driver) installed and in autostart, i had no problems with it beside in GW2. Best is u look if you have any other sound drivers than the default W10 drivers and delete/disable them from autostart.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since launch but now I just login to play the story and explore the fantastic maps while I complete the story each episode. I don‚Äôt like raids or fractals but love the new maps and story.
---
No guy, it has nothing to do with being fucking nice.  You can be nice to Anet all you want.  You can say thank you for the game all you want.  But no, I'm not 'giving them credit' for doing their job the way it's supposed to be done.  If I show up at my lab and fuck up my samples, it's a problem.  My boss doesn't just let it go and then give me 'kudos' when I manage to NOT fuck them up.

I really don't think it would be inflammatory to the community if they would confirm that they're actively working on an expansion right now. It would soothe a lot of minds, I think. When I think of a future in GW2 with only Living World episodes, I get a little upset, because that's not how I want the game to progress. 
---
I love to rally all my friends when a big expansion comes out, and I just don't have the same ability to do so with episodic releases.
---
Weapon inscription is available from the VM merchant (as it probably should be). Same cost to purchase as armor insignia.
---
you should've seen my friend when we were playing the story. she immediately got on glint's corpse and started dancing. she's worse than a mini sometimes.........
---
Hey there. Do you have one of the ticket numbers you submitted? I wonder if you ran into a newbie GM (we have a few right now) who never saw this.
---
Error 1076 means the account you're trying to use cannot work (for a number of different reasons that the player cannot check).
---
The error code is actually present on that page, if you scroll down a bit. :3
---
The answer is: Please contact support, because something is going on the player *cannot* fix on their own.

She spends most of the story time with the Olmakhan. She's actually in the final battle however and is part of the oil meta events.
---
You can turn it off? TIL! Turning that shit off as soon as I get back on. Thanks, friend.
---
Communities will never be happy. You either dump the content and have them angry because you didn't tell them earlier, or you tell them earlier and avoid a level of unhapiness. PvP is literally it.
---
I don't think they match up very well. 
---
Going to assume you mean 5e... metamagic feats etc don't really exist. 
---
If you want a caster try elementalist (archetypal mage with a focus on damage and mastering the elements) or mesmer (illusions and buff/debuffs). 
---
Mesmer brings more utilility and has teleports and portals, whereas elementalist is very combat-focussed.
---
There are also guardians, which are pretty near to clerics in, including having giant floating weapons you can summon to your aid. 
---
hopefully they make both of us look like fools and prove us wrong :')
---
The description of the instability suggested that it was supposed to work that way... Apologies I was doing story &amp; exploration all of  last night.
---
Season 7s ending was in its own way even worse for Jon Snow lol
---
Joko has an advantage since he's not an elder dragon.
---
Are you actually surprised?
---
Which is the other boss? I'd heard of the Qadim issue but I'm unsure on the second. 
---
She was also in one of the raids
---
'mark on your ID'... that's the first I have heard. Did a GM tell you that in a ticket? Because if they did, I'd like to follow up on this and ask them what they are talking about. 0√¥
---
She was the cartoon supergenius villain, shrill cackling and all. Imagine Poison Ivy minus any relevant political message or dark backstory of the 90s with all the technicolor tackiness and gauche of circa 1960s Batman. 
---
2504529 is the one from last year, updated is 7200348! 
---
&gt; Awakened Sylvari
---
Looks much more to me than a simple "nice nod". Shoving such an important tidbit of lore somewhere in the corner of the last instance...
---
Is there a class that plays similar to Tera's slayer? Hard hitting, big sword type thing?
---
So up until 80 (areas), having subpar gear was fine, especially with tankier or evasive classes like Guardian or Mesmer. However, having less-than Exotic tier equipment (preferably in the correct attribute combination on each piece) will instantly be felt when playing. I was also having difficulties swapping classes: couldn't kill things, one hit was knocking me down, never had enough evades to survive long enough, etc etc
---
So that'd be my first suggestion: craft/buy some gear that fulfills the attribute combination you are going for and deck out this new Guardian toon as best you can. You will feel significant improvement. Tying into the next suggestion...
---
Second, look for some guides for builds. Look for PvE attribute combinations that people swear by. Obviously, you can (and should) try to adapt to your needs, but some abilities are simply better than others. Running a bunch of passive signets, for example, *probably* isn't a good build plan. Look and see which abilities are recommended and try to use the ones that work for you and maybe swap some out that don't.
---
Third, practice in the high-tier areas. Find events with tons of people, hunt bounties. Face the "worst of the worst" enemies. Force that challenge on yourself within the relative safety of a big group event and soon you'll find that the lesser spawns feel easy to deal with. Of note, most of those enemies have "strength in numbers" going on, such as Ibogas and Forged. They individually don't do much, but when you have 10 stacks of Poison and Confusion applied in seconds, and get pulled around by various Ibogas, it can get rough. Try *not* to drop into these areas without a game plan to clean up a few in rapid order so you don't get swamped and overwhelmed. Even with the best gear and build, enough Ibogas pulling and applying stacks will pose a threat.
---
Everytime I visit a snowy environment I wear this too ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I'm not even going to touch the idea that we should praise people for completing their jobs. There's something seriously wrong in the industry if people really think it's rare for a content provider to successfully provide content.
---
For the rest, though, I'm probably going to just leave the game for a while. Any gameplay mechanic that fucks with your character control is a lazy, shitty attempt at "difficulty" and never should have happened. I'm trying to claw my way through T3 fractals with PUGs (because every guild I'm in is shit and I don't know enough people to get a static together) and this is just going to make things more impossible for people who already struggle with content that requires more than running in random directions spamming 1.
---
None of the PvP modes can hold my interest (regardless of acronym) and I don't play a "raid meta" class so those are out, too. Feels like what's left in the game for me is just grinding map completion or grinding gold or grinding achievements or grinding something else.
---
I recon they'll postpone it for Super Adventure Box
---
It's always fun to see how Signet of Inspiration will ruin dramatic moments.
---
I think it'll buy the chrono a greater margin of error more than anything else. A few extra seconds of alacrity and quickness is useful, though. 
---
Full armour and trinkets would put you somewhere near +75% boon duration, from my hasty calculations, so with a sigil of concentration on shield and some food and oil, you can probably hit nearly 100 off the bat, which means an extra two and a half seconds of alacrity per ToT, which isn't to be sniffed at. 
---
Not sure it's meta, but I am going to use Eagle runes as an experiment, hoping the much higher crit rate and damage makes up for the lower "normal" damage.
---
So Kralk wears medium armor?
---
I'm so unsure about how they treat death. For example when we died in PoF we got send to the domain of the lost. There we learned that ghosts will be judged and send away. But we also know that there are a crap ton of ghosts all over tyria. Why was the dwarv in this episode a ghost? Wouldn't he also be send to the domain of the lost? What are the reasons why some ghosts stay on tyria and some not? 
---
I hoped they would do something like this long time ago. Glad they finally did!
---
Not really a new thing since some poi are locked behind the day night cycle in the first HoT zone but yes I agree it is annoying
---
Its prob down in old guys tomb he did say there is more good stuff down there 
---
I have a sandstorm gambling problem
---
I don't understand why people would get angry about a game mode having exclusive rewards. Even if they aren't treated equally, but at least some attention is paid to them.  
---
E.G  
---
WvW gets 1 more set this year  
---
PvP gets 3 more sets this year  
---
PvE as a whole gets 6? more sets this year  
---
is better than PvE gets 6 sets and 4 go into the gem store easily.  
---
It just seems kinda silly to me, as someone who is enjoying the game, and all aspects I've so far looked into. Too many outfits seem to go onto the cash shop, and not enough new content goes into WvW/PvP game modes.  
---
Hell, if you reached the top percentile of PvP when the titles were released ( I'm going to estimate 2+ years ago, with the assumption that current titles weren't the ones rewarded at launch ), then what's the point of playing PvP anymore, in terms of value you get out of it? May as well play a different game that rewards gameplay if you're not getting anything out of it.  
---
Anyways, I know I have miles to go before I actually see this frustration bother me, as I've only just began and have 6 years of catchup to do before I get to that point of "grr nothing new", it's just the approach they seem to be taking doesn't seem very good for long-time dedicated players in a lot of senses.  
---
Thanks for the reply though.
---
What is worse? 
---
* Knowing that it's a cliffhanger

The whole thing up to the first bend is upside down. The whole straight part should be rotated 180
---
Next expansion - Guild Wars 2: Pod of Quaggans
---
Not even burned, but probably in pieces. [His head friggin' exploded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKFgHkcsOCw).
---
If you hang out near Taimi in the forge area, you can hear a brief comms call between her and Marjory. I haven‚Äôt waited around long enough to hear if there are other conversations to be heard, though. 
---
Same. I feel GW lore has always revolved around humans. They're the cultural apex of Tyria in terms of lore, exodus, and prophecy. GW1 was told through a human perspective and so my main is a continuation of that legacy. However, that doesn't mean I don't enjoy the other races. I try to make character professions consistent with what I think is normative for that particular race just because I like an ordered and typical background for connecting with a character and the best way to do that for me is to tie the profession association, in some small way, to the race.
---
Lore is all over the place.  The events are generally more relevant to the zones than the story quests.  Most of the enemies (such as the evil gnomes) have motivations and show up again in expansions.  It's a lot to absorb and was built to be ambient and taken at your own pace.  Every zone has some game play relevance so you can always go back to explore if you get curious or feel like you missed something down the road.
---
If you feel like you **need** to know some back story each zone will have a wiki page that will typically have links to the enemy factions present there.
---
The 3 week delay of an episode of season 4, can't remember which one, did not result in a shorter wait time to the upcoming episode.
---
Some of the achievements are definitely bugged. There are things I know for a fact I did right, like Stubborn, but I still lost the achievement. And meanwhile, a guildie I went with took the food/spears and got it.
---
Zombies, ghouls, ghosts, cursed mummies...undead come in all sorts of types. Some variety is far from a bad thing.
---
Oh wow, cool! Thank you for the link!
---
Kralkatorrik's neck is just way too long tho, looks not that good
---
Don't forget the worst one: reworking a "boss" fractal to add a dozen trash packs.
---
That was a nice touch, imo - I liked when it directed my focus during a brief pause in combat. 
---
You raise another argument I hate. This one more than the first.
---
"What's the point of playing if I'm not getting rewards out of it."
---
The Mario series does not provide you with permanent jump boosts for completing a level, so no point in plaything that.
---
DotA2, one of those most popular multiplayer games, doesn't really have exclusive rewards for different queue types. No point playing.
---
Why do people play these? Because they find them fun.
---
But stick the three letters "MMO" in front of it and it's suddenly a mortal sin.
---
This is so bittersweet. They are about to ask for acceptance and the Commander grants it without a second thought. I feel for these Sylvari, they believe they've lost their way and they wish to find it again under the Commander and are embraced with open arms.
---
Well then, to explai  better, resurrection in lore is not granted. It was one of gifts from human gods. Specifically Grenth. Now that they are gone, there are no resurrection spells anymore and the only instance of this happening is our character im pof. Even then we cheated rules of magic to get back from underworld by defeating soul eater and using its consumed magic to open the gate for us to come back.
---
And possibly WHEN are Marjory and Kasmeer?
---
The whole thing got reworked. You can pick it apart all you want, but it got green lit as a package, with the thought in mind that any of them have to work anywhere with all of them.
---
When was the last time they released an armor skin? It's been years hasn't it? 
---
i would look at boons, for me that would be quickness, firebrand has that in spades. can easily be turned into a healer to make content easy.
---
 then either  a dps class that can make might, or high dps like a elementalist who can also stack might. or for skips / speed / fun a dps mesmer.
---
[Datamining thread with the outfit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/adx7vz/datamining_upcoming_features_from_the_january_8/)
---
Boi, this is the second release without hiccups this season and another one delayed. There is nothing exceptional here.
---
Yeah thinking that a gaming company would use the revenue of one game to fund initial development of their next game is totally unheard of. Totally never happens. Clearly they go to the bank to ask for funding for their sequel! 
---
Even drugs wouldn't explain your stupidity, tbh.
---
There was no time to think, Glint sends someone to flat-out tell you to attack RIGHT NOW or the world is done. You were manipulated and set up to fail from the start.
---
*closes out the duplicate ticket* Only ONE ticket per issue, please, the team loses a lot of time closing out duplicate contacts.  Thank you!
---
Okay, in your previous ticket you did not mention error 1076, meaning the team had no indication of looking into anything but a technical issue. Telling the team about *everything* that is happening is vital so we know what to look for. In this case, that could have helped us get you help sooner. Your ticket mentioned: "Error 58:11:5:535" - which makes it look as if it was actually missing some bits at the end - :101. Without that end bit, the team was looking for a technical issue, not an account issue. 
---
:101 makes it very clear that the error 58 is actually linked to error 1076. Without that, the team wouldn't look there.
---
2504529 - from 2017, is about getting a level 80 boost. At that time, the team had no means to grant these, as they were a server-granted item. It appears unrelated. 
---
For your own records, the core trigger of this problem in your case appears related to Ticket #6803429 and how your account behaved after that ticket.
---
I've added some notes to your open ticket so the team can help you when they get to you!
---
Bu they are still dead. They are aware of who they are but they are not the same creature they were before death.
---
It was 5am when I typed that lmao. What if kralkatorrik****** reanimated aurene?
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Regarding episode 6, we might see it releasing in March as it looked like episode 5 could have been released juste before the holiday season but has been postponed due to their teams going in vacation shortly after the release (which would have meant no bug fixes for quite some time). 70 to 100 days after mid-December would lead us to March.  
---
Releasing episode 6 in April would also clash with annual SAB.
---
So if we both know the problem why praising them? Are we their slaves?
---
necrocopter almost doesn't move you anywhere when sliding. slippery slope is easily manageable by dodges, dodgejumps and careful WSAD movement. other instabilities so far that i've played with weren't a problem at all, even though someone in my static paniced as well. especially the 300% more damage one was so scary, but even the hordes of grawls and fire elementals didn't do anything to us, you just bring blinds, blocks, reflects. ez
---
you can also reflect the "we bleed fire" 
---
so far i think the instabs are adding either fun or are neutral. definitely social awk is much nicer now, you can even push party members of the cliffs to regain life force
---
You craft the normal one.
---
You go to the forge master and buy an item after you have crafted it.
---
You complete some achievements.
---
You get the Ascended recipe.
---
I just rehashed what he said because it really wasn't that hard to understand.
---
The social awkwardness range is small enough for all players to fit in the circle, so that's okay. What happened with us though is that as soon as there was a person with a green circle, we all rushed there to save him, pushing each other into the AOE's... That's gonna take some practice. I think social awkwardness is not a good combination with this fractal but it's not unplayable.
---
One of *those* Warrior Monks? My wammo feels attacked
---
In [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mRYC-kbc-M) with Tara Strong, Scarlet's voice actor, the character description they gave her was "A british Harley [Quinn]".
---
Do you sincerely believe they'll give 9x elite specs as part of a LW episode?
---
I mean hoping is nice but it doesn't mean much. I hope one day anet won't neglect pvp, wvw, raids, every part of their minority that isn't LS casual, ... 
---
In reality I don't think most of those are very likely.  
---
I try tier 1 or tier 2 fractals, depending on how little confidence I have.
---
The moment where the PC is standing on the platform, waiting for Kralk to arrive was surprisingly nerve-wracking for me. 
---
I wanted to rush through it, but reminded myself that the fight wasn't going to start without me, and that I could take the time to savor the details (as I wasn't going for the achievement). 
---
Fractals haven't been fun since before HoT, and they still somehow find ways to make them worse
---
Oooh, I haven't done them yet :X
---
Instabilities needed to be removed a long time ago but Anet can't seem to get this through their head
---
I feel like they could do some visual stuff with the fact that kralkatorrik has been swimming around in the mists. 
---
I'd hate to make a correlation to FortNite's BR but that map changes a lot and usually has some new event revolving around the implementations they make  for a brief time. Considering the battlegrounds are in the ever-changing mists I feel like more stuff could happen to it. At least visually if not game-changing.
---
What happens next month when everyone's moved on? There's been a decent amount of incredibly frustrating content I've had to get just because I wasn't playing a lot of this stuff on Day 1.
---
Actually that would be an amazing idea. I am totally for the idea of an ever changing map. I think it could keep things fresh and not upset players as much as say a nerf.
---
The chaos build is outdated, this is honestly just bad advice for raiding. You should defenitely use illusions traitline and shatter
---
Yes, this is something to with ArcDPS. This will happen *every update*. Uninstall instructions on the Arc website.
---
It's best not to use Arc for the week following a patch because issues like this. Honestly, I wouldn't use it at all as it's causing more and more crashes even without updates.
---
Yep. If they tell us what they're working on, or give us any chance to build up expectations (based in reality or not) - it's guaranteed that either something will fall through, something will change, or something won't live up to our expectations. 
---
It's like when people complain that devs "lie" - when in reality, most of the time they just told us something they planned/intended, which is *always* subject to change in software/game development, and we held them to it as if it were a guarantee. 
---
Not necessarily. There is most definitely a reason on why they would kill Aurene for plot reasons. Maybe her death, especially after the years she has bonded with everyone around her, would open up the true way of leading Tyria into salvation.   
---
I'm gonna mention Infinity War, but I'm positive that Dr. Strange's stunt is what opened up the way to the remaining Avengers to the one path that'll lead to their ultimate victory. It might be the same in this case.
---
This makes perfect sense. My bad. Last time we also had an LS as Outro and an LS as Intro. So the current one is the ending chapter of Path of Fire, and after the Prologue coming after we will have an Xpac
---
Sieran, maybe.
---
But Tybalt? I know he's a favorite here, but I'd sacrifice Aurene to keep him away.
---
shes good at making me feel bad because i actually want to off myself every time she opens her mouth
---
You need to go visit Elder Gawr in Atholma (Sandswept Isles) and watch him train the lifebenders
---
Lvl 100 should be Don
---
all good, not the first time anet's descriptions had this effect
---
My kingdom for a Paragon ES for warrior. We'll run out of weapons at some point.
---
That and even if you are someone who has made a character to try to keep in the 40-50 range, farming, crafting, opening boxes, etc... still nets you XP, even if it is slow.  It's hard to just keep a character at that point.  
---
Source:  I try to keep a character at that point.
---
I thought it was terrible lol
---
It the same old story where you go around and do goofy mechanic with your special action, pick up items off the ground, and kill trash mobs, burn a weird structure that acts as part of the monster, then repeat instead of, you know actually fighting the boss?
---
Yeah I sure love spamming f and killing trash mobs next to a pillar. At least the mordemoth fight actually felt somewhat engaging. This was almost as bad as killing Zhaitan with a cannon
---
Aurene, the elder dragon of all, the breaker of rules, the devourer of Jokos. Need a few more titles to make her the ultimate being plz :p
---
Tier 3 structures are way too powerful and kill all action in the surrounding area.  The tactivators are too strong (esp SMC).  They need to remove, nerf, or change how some of that stuff works.  For EBG specifically, they should make it so SMC never goes above tier 1.  It would promote a lot more action, and you wouldn't have so many of those players who just hug the SMC walls and run back inside whenever the battle turns against them.  
---
And that's if the event required to fail spawn. After the Thunder Keep event yesterday I saw an alert that a rift was opening in Deldrimor Ruins in X:XX seconds. Got there, countdown reached zero, then everything just... disappeared. Nothing happened. The event actually failed to launch lol.
---
There is a lot of serverside managed stuff in this episodes. I wish I had a better word for it so I‚Äôll give examples
---
The excavation sites at the priory heart give on artifact and only one player can‚Äôt pick it up
---
The fish ponds at the dredge heart go away for everyone after a player makes a fish jump out 
---
Some story achievements can only be earned by the story opener even if the other group members are eligible (Stubborn for example)
---
Furthermore (but that‚Äôs only my feeling and I have no confirmation yet) I have the creeping feeling that to spawn the next dwarven plate, you have to be the last one to do the finishing hit on the Ghost Eater. Similar to your crystal experience. Because I killed the guy 12 times and it didn‚Äôt drop until the last time where I killed it all alone. All times before I had help by more than 2 random players 
---
Imagine if you had to do 60 hours of PvE for a gift of exploration while you don't PvE ...
---
Well... now I want to play that
---
Oh lol well that's embarrassing on my part
---
And we got a slow release last time an episode was delayed, that didn't have christmas holidays to contend with.
---
We also have super adventure box coming in 3 months time.
---
My point remains, the OP is way too optimistic regarding this.  They are averaging 100 days per episode. If it keeps with this pace (no reason to believe that will change as of the moment).
---
Currently we are looking at an episode roughly two weeks after april fools at 100 days, that checks out.
---
From the start i knew i was going to get at least one of each class and one of each race. Because gw1 i really love ascalon and really liked the Guardian from betas. Charrdian was the natural choice. Though hes fallen a bit out of favor recently due to wanting to try new shit in endgame.
---
Totally valid opinion, though I'm certain it's shared by a small minority of players.  If you don't like Aurene then I suppose the topic isn't really for you.
---
When does the current sale on the official website ends?
---
Do yourself a favor an just ignore the story, it it by far the weakest part of the game and will only make your experience worse 
---
&gt; into PoF to start doing HP to unlock DH
---
DH is HoT, FB is PoF so i dunno which one you mean
---
as for training just keep playing and know what your defensive abilities such as blinds and blocks are(you get plenty as guardian)
---
when i learn a new class i try to get familiar with the rotation and then just play it, most are easy to get a grasp of and over time you get the "feel" of it all
---
That would be an incredibly stupid and ignorant reason considering people can do that on existing maps already unless you are referring to the Branded Mass but that is because they made that grindy to begin with.
---
Would you recommend those new stats for a newbie-raid-chrono?
---
I want to release our poor main chrono from chrono jail and switch roles with him (he will be playing healer then).
---
So I guess I'm not going to do perfect rotations off the bat. Will those new stats forgive more errors?
---
That did also happen to me once today while waiting and again last night before logging off. Really inconsistent.
---
I am just on the brink of finishing lvl 80 personal story q q
---
Thank you so much! I will close out the extra ticket
---
Believe me, I'm used to being in the minority of players at this point 
---
And yet no Zojja...
---
Ok, nice to know. 
---
I plan to farm most materials needed while I play the game for the next months. I'm just get preparations done so I don't get surprised by time-gated stuff in 2 or 3 months from now.
---
its a bit weird how none of your friends mention them in the battle preparations though. 
---
I'm still excited but the wait is gonna murder my hype.
---
How much do you clear cm100 exactly? I mean sure its anecdotal but happens literally everyday with our static group. Just because you or your friends don't experience this very common bug, doesn't mean its not an issue. The only common thing I can imagine is high dps / clear efficiency, which would explain why casual fractal players might not get it. I'm not sure if it even appears on regular 100. 
---
And deepstone, apart from the scenery is just a boring fractal. That's because it has 3 boring bosses. A spider that shoots web, dont stand in a cone in front of it. An air elemental who spawns tornadoes and a boss that teleports around and occasionally summons minions that we need to prevent from going to him. The light of deldrimor is just an inconvenience and the dwarven puzzle boils down to spamming special action key. 
---
And oh god does deepstone have shitty dialogue. Ive seen harry potter fan erotic fanfiction with better dialogue than that. " **Torin:** All right, they killed it. How come the door still isn't opening? **Kay:** Maybe let them finish killing all the shadow monsters first. ". This fractal alone made me turn dialogue volumes off. The dialogue is so unnatural, expositional and at moments very overacted. It feels like its a first draft of a script that they auditioned people off of.
---
Twilight oasis is a long story oriented map but the last boss is at least satisfying. It had epic visuals and good mechanics. Deepstone doesnt have either. And the new siren fractal bossfight consists of massive aoe CC spam and massive enemy mob spam without any interesting visuals or mechanics. 
---
An mmo with tens, even hundreds of thousands of active players shouldn't need to playtest their updates.  I don't think fractal devs even actually play their own fractals. It shouldn't be tolerated that they release super unbalanced patches and game mechanics.
---
&gt;waiting for Kralk to arrive was surprisingly nerve-wracking for me.
---
They did such a good job setting the tone for the fight I felt the unease standing there, the calm before the brandstorm.
---
Do I have to be invited to their discords?  I've tried to look into it before, but couldn't figure out how to join
---
this spoils the gw1 dragon's lair mission
---
Disagree, personally, as I like my armor and upgrades, but to each their own... 
---
There are zero things locked behind day night cycle. Some things are locked behind having one or more masteries.
---
Not an important appearance, don't worry about spoilers. 
---
Ah alright, my bad then. 
---
Look at meta builds, and practice their rotations on the golem. Get a bunch of friends, and then do a ton of a dungeon runs.
---
This is what I generally do. It's easy content, but helps you learn how the class works. From there you can change your build up to be better for soloing harder content now that you have a better feeling for the class.
---
It all really just comes down to practice. Guides will tell you what to press, but don't always tell you in detail why, or what you're waiting for. Sometimes saying "Auto attack until skill 3 is ocd" makes more sense than "Auto attack chain x3" and it's something you'll just learn from playing it.
---
It mostly comes from just understanding the class. I like working from meta builds for groups, then adapting them into solo builds. That way I can understand what things do the most damage, what makes the class good, then finding what ways makes it survive more easily. Unfortunately, there's no "Go pro now" solution in the game. It's going to take time, but I find this is the best way to get the understanding in.
---
Cantha? Nah, we're obviously headed to the New World to take down a whole new set of elder dragons.
---
Given Quinn's origin in the 90s Batman cartoon, this isn't surprising. Its a testimony to her skill that she nailed the role, even if the direction and writing were shit.
---
But that effort is why they stopped doing dungeons. Less effort is the way amiright ;) 
---
Your time will come. And then you'll beg for this not to happen too.
---
Even people who play GW2 have no reason to be hyped lol
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what im worried about. But maybe they‚Äôll do a feature release like feature packs back in 2013
---
Are you suggesting going toe to toe with a scyscraper that shoots lightning and converts you to its ally? It sounds like you would think it would be better to go toe to toe with a scyscraper that shoots lightning and converts you to its ally.
---
Most desperate last stands are rushed hackjobs. We just didn't win this time.
---
Since when what?
---
When I entered the map for the first time, right after the 1st instance and the first music plays .. I was left without words except : "Brilliant .." .. has been a long time since I felt like that. Last time I did was throught Witcher 3 when I approach the Hanged Corpse Tree .. 
---
Yep, figured as much. Going to be tricky for a while, but not insurmountable. People will just have to do something similar to what is done for the "friends" mechanic at Samarog, i.e. person with big green circle stand in a safe spot and people go stand nearby. And stand; not seaweed shuffle or dance around like a coma patient being stood up and zapped with a cattle prod.
---
Though it is a mechanic that could probably do with the yellow border notification that you get in raids when in some circles or have certain mechanics on you. Might make it too "easy" but it would at least mean you could be sure you're doing the mechanic and not in danger of sending your mates flying into danger... 
---
And where the fuck is it anets fault that he creates 70 toons?
---
I can 100% guarantee 70% of them are not fully end gear equipped meaning they do not belong into an END GAME MAP at all.
---
Fucking whiny idiots this bs thread.
---
What since when?
---
&gt; like you said, pay for a transfer. 
---
IIRC free can not transfer at all even if you are willing to pay for the transfer
---
I HATE YOU!
---
Is this a trick question? ü§î
---
I got a gamebreaking bug at the last mission but well i guess it is still pretty smooth compared to other patches.
---
Does hovering over the pet display pretty much everything like merged type, terrestrial/amphibian, name, F2 skills etc etc
---
My first question is always the same; "Is there a new endless tonic? (Skritt/Quaggan Combat Tonic especially)" I was disappoint.
---
&gt;To give an example so that we're not talking purely hand-waving-hypotheticals, I think Path of Exile handles this process *far* more effectively and professionally. They have a semi-public-alpha before ladder releases that seems much more heavily vetted than GW2. Yes, it's a different sort of game entirely, but their backend is likely undergoing similar orders-of-magnitude of traffic
---
I agree with most of your post, except this part. PoE launched nearly a year after GW2. GW2 started development in 2007, before DevOps was even a thing, let alone big in any capacity. They absolutely will have tech debt leftover related to design decisions made back then that cause certain problems with changing/adding/updating and even testing things. As for traffic, it all depends on what the servers/instances have to do. I'm a bit out of my league here as I'm not sure if GW2's megaservers + persistent world would have a greater/lesser need for resources than something like PoE's hub-based world.  
---
The big issue that still seems to be missed is cost. A public test realm would cost money to engineer, build, but (most importantly) to keep running. We're running into that now, working to optimize our cloud resources so we don't end up overpaying for more resources than we're actually using. I'm not saying it's not possible for a PTR with GW2, just that there's a lot that we don't know about the GW2 infrastructure.
---
I'm not saying the episode is bad, after I beat episode 4 which was so very nice and a lot of fun, one of my favorite episodes I was looking forward to episode 5  
---
episode 5 rolled out and  as I played through it, the buildup to the so called "all or nothing" fight felt forgetable? for me at least, all this gathering random rocks and plates didn't really feel like a preperation to an epic fight it felt like putting something there so there is something to do, it's clear that the fight was the highlight of the episode 
---
HAHAHA Evil Gnomes with their experimentation facilities!
---
as has already been said by others if you want to know more about the world building and background lore of the areas you will have to talk to NPCs like renown heart vendors and event NPC's.
---
If you want a shit ton of information on every part of the game from an external source I would Recommend Wooden Potatoes GW2 playthrough on youtube. Sure it's not in-game but if you are interested in the lore I'm not sure there is any better single resource.
---
Same here, if his power raise Aurene back, I will praise Joko too.
---
Play during pvp season ranked. The last chest is 20g and repeatable. The other chests will give over 10g also.  Choose The Pof reward tracks like The Crystal Desert it will give you junk items u can sell to vendors for 50silver (the more junk the more you can sell) Since the season is over look at the pvp browser during reset to find a Dailies map, it helps players get quick daily rewards from the hero panel and also helps get rewards from the reward track (but it‚Äôs cap on certain number of points because it‚Äôs a unranked match).  Reward tracks are also in WvW, so if I was you I‚Äôll switch between the two games because pvp can get annoying at times. If you have a guild hall buy a pvp reward track boost and use some other boosters like magic find. 
---
KC is Bugged again. The statues dont remove stacks form KC while hes in the air.
---
Last phase is very hard/nearly unplayable.
---
...I honestly believe it's done this for a while now, like any skill you hover over (pets are effectively a complex skill, after all)
---
It's better when a season is active. Unfortunately it just ended yesterday and probably won't be back for a month.
---
Jan 14.
---
This is definately a hint as to why Aurene was able to brand Caithe without corrupting her 
---
Well, sorry. But it's as if you went into a Star Wars subreddit and got upset that someone mentions that Darth Vader is Luke's father because you haven't watched that film already :/
---
I‚Äôm so glad there‚Äôs not. Long may that continue. 
---
What's that? Oh, old content I ah *cough* new gemstore items! Look at that!
---
What do you consider high? Exotics should be fine for anything other than fractals and that is not really high.
---
So 200 branded mass can get us the upgraded version of a weapon? Yesterday people were talking in the thousands. 
---
The first piece... I didn't notice the lyrics in-game. It wasn't until I found it on YouTube just a while back that I realized they were singing about Aurene.
---
I choke up every time I listen to it. If I keep at it I'm going to break down.
---
[SPOILERS]
---
It sounds pretentious but I expected the ending to an extent. It looks like anet has this semi-pattern of ending seasons. So it was kinda predictable that something bad will happen, most likely with someone's death. But I think that Anet screwed up here a bit. Let's call it the "Marvel shock" or I guess "Infinity war shock" since they killed a character so major that they can't possibly expect us to believe that Aurene will remain dead, since her destiny is to replace the elder dragons or at least Kralkatorrik. She is the most important character in commander's story, even more than the commander. It would be more of a shock if they killed like Logan or Rytlock or Taimi or some other character that's close to the commander.
---
&gt; (except Jahai) is locked behind an event,
---
Jahai has one locked behind an event too, unless you do the story.
---
If WvW is too be successful aNet needs to severely reduce the amount of servers and make trading servers more viable. I doubt aNet cares.
---
It‚Äôs posted on their site. 
---
First pack I've bought and only the second time spending on mount skins ever (first was a direct purchase of Mesmer Jackal). 
---
Round your level out to the nearest multiple of 10 (so if you were Lv11 crafting you'd look for the Lv10 section on the gw2crafts page) and go from there as it not only lists the initial 0-400 materials list but also has a breakdown per section for people who, like you, already had levels in their crafting profession.
---
I'll just laugh at all degenerates who are downvoting me in 9 months. If you do not realise that there's a content drought even with this LS system, you're blind fanboy and you shouldn't talk shit about others. Especially since you don't even know about Quarter sales reports on this sub get posted every 3 months.
---
That either requires you to have Teleport to Friend stones (which are given in limited quantity) or an active non-AFK Mesmer on the other side.
---
Using AWS doesn't mean it's faster to setup infrastructure. AWS is most definitely designed for that, but half of the tech jobs I've had using AWS didn't use the AWS tooling that made spinning up infrastructure easy.... always did it manually because it "Was too much time/work" to write the tooling the automate the creation process.
---
Just what I was about to ask, im confused
---
Yep... it also goes on cooldown if you cancel the cast
---
raid developement slowed down because few people play them
---
I'm literally suggesting less effort in the first place :)
---
i mean sure - mini reworking instabilityless fractals so they become "challenging" again takes work but that can be done in their 6 months release cycle
---
Every map is separate and governed by the same general rules for normal nodes, but map currencies and other exceptions exist.  
---
All map currencies have a max cap which can be harvested from world nodes per account per day.  Winterberry spawns have their own set number with a higher tolerance than others.  You'll see them disappear after hitting them with enough alts, but that number is the same every day.  Maxing out a map currency prohibits harvesting them from the world for the game day, but they can still bought from heart vendors and earned from events and daily achievements.  
---
Silverwastes rich nodes have their own rules which get wonky--you'll still see them on your first alt but they'll disappear after only giving up a couple ore.  
---
Static nodes like rich ore on known farming routes and the flax patches in HoT also have a daily limit for alt farming, specific to each map; maxing out the flax patch in TD will not despawn the flax patch in Verdant Brink, and maxing out the rich iron node in one map will not despawn the rich iron nodes in others.  
---
I'm not sure on the numbers on the new map's ore patches, but they'll have their own rules which stay the same on daily farming limits, just like the flax patches.  
---
I need to make a ranger. 
---
Yuuup same here. But honestly I knew better than to divebomb my griffin straight into a giant, static object mesh. Not the first time I've gotten stuck that way lol..
---
Adapt to it. The pattern is almost always the same: discover new armor/weapon/consumable and eventually craft several of them. As long as the craftable items are colored, they'll give experience.
---
What, where? O_O
---
Thank you for your answers and all the advice :)
---
Time for a chrono boot camp :D
---
Thanks for that! I did some looking about and it seems KC is bugged so that the buff isn't removed if he has jumped up and a statue is killed beneath. 
---
Some events have problem spawning (like the Rift ones), others are dependent of meta events (the Ice Hydra always spawn after the oil meta). Then there is Pepperseed (?) and the defense event that happens ... sometime.
---
And finally the Skritt explorer you have to defend. 
---
The map sure feel less alive than previous releases considering the big cooldowns + the low amount of events.
---
I also struggled with this. My room order was Red&gt;Blue&gt;Purple.
---
I tried killing the graveling ghost eater eight times with seemingly no luck, I almost gave up assuming it was fully bugged, until finally a green plate flew out of him.
---
For anyone else having issues, keep killing him until it drops and good luck.
---
I tested it again after getting my rewards and managed to spot a green plate on the floor after killing him that didn't have text above it. So keep an eye on floor of the room too:
---

---
Yep. Play for the new story then play other games. They really killed the feeling of playing this game with no repeatable content for PoF maps. This whole expansion is just made for the Casual player to come back and enjoy, they are not giving people a reason to keep playing. If you do not have a goal or reason to play it's simple - you won't. So have a goal like a legendary or chase raids or find some good people to play with and they should make things enjoyable enough for you to stay. I feel like playing an MMORPG alone is such a loss... it's better to play a console game.
---
You technically can replace them as long as the motherboard can support the upgrade, but it's generally not feasible as it's more complicated for end users with no experience with computers, more costly in some cases, and you're still stuck with the initial constraints of mobile hardware, power, cooling systems, and so on.   
---
Laptops as products are generally not built to be up-gradable, adaptable, or powerful. First and foremost, they're built for convenience and portability. That's why they exist.
---
In regards to feeling like ‚Äúthis dragon is the dearest thing to my heart‚Äù that‚Äôs how I feel about Canach (minus being a dragon). Literally the best character they‚Äôve got.
---
For the two complete sets

and then I got stuck below the rubble and had to exit instance Q_Q
---
Imagine they‚Äôll wait until they‚Äôve bumped off Taimi so we don‚Äôt end up overrun by annoying little cave rabbits.
---
&gt; I can 100% guarantee 70% of them are not fully end gear equipped meaning they do not belong into an END GAME MAP at all.
---
Do I spy some end-gear elitism? Let me guess, if they're not in fully Ascended equipment they need to go get good?
---
bullshit. ignore that OP.
---
Too many n‚Äôs in personal my friend.
---
Moi le graphics c‚Äôest pas so bon, but moi amin√© vid√©o üôÉ
---
I have a love-hate relationship with their animations. Specifically the way they flop around whilst moving.
---
almost all events on every map have some voiced dialogue before they start or after they are finished. also stay at the NPCs when a event is done. many times (not always!) it will chain into another event and so on.
---
gw2's lore and world building is very audio heavy. 
---
also speak with everyone you can. especially the guards with the little spyglasses over their heads. they tell you what is going on in every part of every map.
---
That happend to me, too. But this is a problem that was already in Jahai Bluffs. Not quite sure if it's a bug or somehow wanted. 
---
Sorry, but you'll have to wait in line with a ticket like everybody else. 
---
I don't think it's that people think it's rare, just that people appreciate the entertainment that the devs provide.
---
Like how one would praise a theatre show even though 'they were just doing their job'.
---
Aye, and they DO use both at times, and have done several times, and thus they clearly do have the stats on which way generates more money. 
---
Give them a break, they are only a small indie company.
---
More than instabilities haven taken them :p 
---
Now we REALLY need a SAB world 3 adding a mount that is used within the box.
---
Over 10k hours here and as much as i love the game and know how much better it is compared to other mmos, i just need something different to play. Right now i'm playing another mmo and holy shit it's bad, but i still don't feel like returning to gw2. 
---
Lol
---
Most tech jobs are a bunch of dumb monkeys hammering on keyboards trying to turn VC money into operating revenue. 9 of 10 tech companies fail, so clearly those folks aren't doing their jobs well. You spend time up front getting orchestration right so you never have to do it again, and over the course of years, the time spent up front pays off.
---
I'm willing to be this change was only made after play testing.
---
*doo-doo-doo-doo!*
---
"Um, guys? That's got to fucking go."
---
Trahearne's death is generally a good one in my book, it served a purpose and was meaningful so I admit I shouldn't have listed it with the others. I guess I'm just a bit sad about it because I think the only reason he got killed off is because everyone hated him, even though I think he was a great character for the sake of the story - him carrying the mantle of leadership while we the player characters are his ally and confidante would have been much better than us being the pact commander, since anet couldn't have possibly pulled that off in a satisfying way. And in the end they didn't, they eventually replaced us and got Logan to lead it instead while we "lead" our own "guild". Which also could be a completely separate topic since it's something that's been stretched and restretched thin for the past... 3 years? Or 5 if you count the initial introduction of DW's members? without any concrete resolution or even an idea of where it's headed. If anything they know even less now than they did before since half of our guild is perpetually "on a bench" with nothing to do.
---
And the neverending stream of apocalypses is exactly what I mean, it gets old when everyone always acts the same way and never adapts after each catastrophe. Every time it's the same thing, whether it's the dragons, mursaat, scarlet, joko, the gods or any other villain of the season / episode - we follow a convenient trail of breadcrumbs until in the last episode something big happens, at which point someone comes with a new crazy plan and we just improvise and hope for the best.  
---
The convenient mordremoth weakness we discover 1 minute before entering his mind, accidentally while rescuing trahearne? Omadd's machine? Our plan to deal with balthazar which consists of running after him and directly fighting him again and again, even after he first kills vlast, then kills us... and then rytlock gets sick of it, gives us a sword at the very and and we just go fight him again and then win? Joko had a year long buildup, constantly saying how this time he's smarter and won't waste time on evil villain speeches and instead goes to enact his grand plan... and then in the next episode we just walk to him in his palace, seemingly doing exactly what he wanted us to do, triggering every trap he set up... and then he has a villain monologue and Aurene just eats him. Fin.
---
How are any of these satisfying resolutions or good storywriting? It's just running in circles and doing the same thing again and again. And you just know that aurene will be revived somehow and our characters won't learn anything out of this because the writers simply can't write them better, next time marjory or kas will die and we'll be sad and people will again praise how brave anet is for ditching characters that haven't done anything noteworthy in years...
---
Is it possible to salvage the exotic versions with a black lion kit to get back the inscriptions?
---
Explore and spend more time in the map.
---
Having said that, this patch didn't really feel as content heavy as they made it sound like LS would be, going forward.
---
"GW2 started development in 2007, before DevOps was even a thing, let alone big in any capacity"
---
I take issue with this.  I was a sysadmin on the east coast in that year, and while "devops" wasn't the buzzword concept it is today, the processes are all isomorphic.  We used piles of puppet/nagios back then (which with a thin amount of glue code and/or VCS hooks was easily as powerful as CI pipes nowdays if not as shiny), and Xen/KVM were in vogue instead of Docker, and often treated physical clusters via IPMI as a k8s cluster might look nowadays, in terms of creating umbrella infra to manage scalability and transparent deployment.  Tech has not changed so much that these learnings are novel, in any respect.
---
Tangent Re: megaservers vs hub, since I'm _somewhat_ in my league here and am thinking partially out loud to myself (my post-doc was in simulation engine design, and my focus in industry is large scale distributed systems)  but still talking out my ass so feel free to skip this:  My sense is that they trade problem spaces, but that neither is "impossibly harder."  Megaserver can have what, 300 concurrent players?  give or take.  That's not really a huge # of clients in a shard.  Other MMOs have pushed that limit further.  (To be clear, this isn't a critique of Anet as was my "they don't test enough", this is a judgement call one has to make in architecture, I only mean to say it's not "Bleeding Edge" level tech).  Similarly, POE has _tiny_ shards, but _many many_ more of them comparably.  I imagine lots of complexity in terms of caching shard images, deploying, keeping a hot pool, etc, but again, this is a similar problem space to other parts of industry.  Different challenges for each, but I'd t-shirt-size them similarly in raw "how painful is this to engineer"
---
That was a tangent to basically say "they're both solving different dimensions of not-that-ridiculous tech problems", at least WRT how it relates to our core discussion.
---
The final note I'd make is that GW2 _has_ private test realms.  The have a limited set of non-famous players who they've invited into these groups.  HOWEVER, and this is where one aspect of my criticism comes in, this process has been notoriously badly managed (without even mentioning stories I experienced myself, the public fallout of the raid-alpha-testing is a great example.)  They simply have a bad track record at accomplishing the same level of due diligence that comparable entities show, and any evidence I have says that they are not undulely resource limited or hamstrung in such a way that this should be so difficult.  I'd drop this entertaining anecdote:  For a substantial amount of time, the QA team Anet utilized did not have a raid group that was able to beat Gorseval.  (I believe this has been rectified, I just mean to say, I have no evidence to show them to be masters of quality control)
---
I'm sure it's because they don't want it to clip with the player character's extremities, but having the sword drag so low on the waist to the point where the pommel is waist level when it should be the guard at waist level. Nobody hangs a sword from their belt at the pommel. 
---
"Urge to kill rising!"
---
I do tend to agree in some respects. Outside the lore content, every other content is more of an excuse to hang around my guildies. Kinda like when your with friends, and you're looking for sth to do. Not necessarily anything mind blowingly interesting, but just sth to do together. 
---
With that said, I don't really blame Anet too much for doing this since it's a problem with almost every other MMO out there. The obvious solution to this problem would be any content that would be customizable. First thing that comes to mind and sth that a lot of ppl want would be actual player housing (we don't talk about home instances). 
---
What I personally would like to see is a system similar to a game called "A mighty quest for epic loot". Basically combines dungeon builders and dungeon crawlers with a social game format. I think it could work really well if we ever do get a housing system. 
---
Pretty far fetched idea tho. Currently, when I'm done with the lore, I'm pretty much just jumping around LA chatting with guildies lol.
---
Did you have a stroke?
---
That scene was probably one of the most intense in the whole game, ending with a simple "i don't know", man that hurt ...
---

What do you mean recently? You have to successfully finish Vinewraith to get 100% on Silverwastes. This isn't new.

It is annoying though.

Isn't he the one who gives you a giant kebab on final instance?
---
Though that was only a temporary 'Brand'
---
Well it‚Äôs cool when you talk to scourges in the desert too they talk about the reason jokos magic was so uniquely strong is because he uses life force and the soul differently than a normal necromancer. So awakened isn‚Äôt necessarily reanimating, it‚Äôs the binding of a pure life‚Äôs force into a vessel. 
---
A sylvari being awakened means they had a soul though 
---
So there's no other way that you know of to obtain the jewels besides doing the map metas to be able to solve the catacombs puzzle? They can't be crafted in some way?

Dont play every day.

---
Your ticket is indeed in the system, and open, and will be handled when it reached the top of the queue.
---
I think you need to learn to play when you want to, and to play something else when you want to play that instead of GW2.  
---
I play very casually...there's far more in the game than I could ever finish, and I have tons of goals for myself that I choose to work on because I enjoy it.
---
I'm usually very honest with myself on whether I want to play...do I know exactly what I want to do as soon as I log in?  If not, I do something else.  Otherwise I'm going to be burnt out searching for something to do.
---
It's completely okay for GW2 to not be the only game you play.  Just play the parts you want and enjoy it.
---
The audio team thanks you for your compliments! I'm just speaking for myself here, but we so rarely get direct feedback on sound from players that I get unreasonably happy when I see posts like these. :D

Cool tip: you can use Springer's jump &gt; Bond of Faith &gt; mount Griffon for a little height boost. It requires some timing and isn't much but hey, it's something.
---
Yes, in at least 2 threads.
---
Fun Fact: She first appeared in Hall of Chains (Raid) as an Easter Egg at the very beginning. Easy to miss.
---
Hey Cameron!  
---
Just wanted to say that the custom animations really added a whole other level of production value, the story instance didn't feel like an mmo at all. (positively)  
---
Same thing goes for the camera lock you introduced, where it locks to the important stuff. I'd 100% missed the awesome animations of Aurene flying over Kralk if the camera didn't do that, as I often play looking almost straight down. Please don't overuse it, but do use it for big spectacles like this.  
---
Lastly, the Kralk fight definitely weighed up for Zhaitan. Well done to the whole team. I hope the next one is just as good.
---
Yeah I have to agree on the death part. 
---
If Anet has balls they would let Aurene stay dead. But that probably won't happen. Also, I'm kinda disappointed that only Aurene died. I think Braham, Cannach, Rox, Logan, and Rytlock plus a bunch of minor characters were good candidates to die. It would have been pretty shocking and sad, but I would really believe that they're gone. 
---
As for Taimi, they're really building up her health problem so it would be super awkward if she died here lol. With that said, I hope they actually go full on with her disease(?) and kill her off in a sacrificial way. It would feel pretty cheap if we just miraculously find a way to cure her. 
---
Istan is a severe outlier that's damaging the economy a ton. 
---
Well, as per last episode, Taimi is effectively the walking dead, but yeah I was kinda hoping we‚Äôd find out that Marjory and Kasmeer had been devoured on their scouting mission.
---
But how do you feel about Choya?
---
&gt; 8gb RAM is enough for GW2 unless you're running a lot of things in the background.
---
What do you consider a lot of things? Because with GW2, chrome, discord, and spotify, I easily push 7500mb.
---
in the oil meta, when we are going to extract the oil and the dredge shout: "Comrads, we bring you freedom"
---
LOL
---
What stats I should get for my revenant? I'm open to play either elite spec, I like them both, but have no idea if I should go to Berserker's (Power Herald), Viper's (Condi Rene) or somekinda support with Harrier's or Diviner's? Halp pls
---
i hate this so much :(
---
Most people do legendaries because they love the look of the weapon, not for the stats.
---
Which leads me to one of the main reasons I play: making new characters and dressing them up. Fashion Wars is a huge part of my motivation -- I love leveling a new character with a new personality and backstory and putting together the gear for their final "look". That's not something that will appeal to everyone, obviously, but it definitely works for a lot of people. Heck, I enjoy the entire leveling process, and make a game out of seeing how much map completion I can get on each one before hitting 80, resisting the urge to use the stacks of tomes and exp scrolls in my bank for as long as possible, etc. Eventually I complete the map on all of them, because why not? (I know some folks find this tedious, but for some reason it works for me.)
---
I also chase achievements. "Almost 10k AP" isn't even *half* the AP that's available, and some of them are really fun to do. I personally really like collections, and I enjoy the sense of accomplishment I get from completing long and difficult ones.
---
I never get tired of World Bosses. I like some more than others, and the ones I prefer tend to shift over time based on my mood and what I get temporarily bored with, but I still remember trying to take down Shadow Behemoth back during the beta and being absolutely astounded at the idea of a random bunch of folks coming together to take down this enormous thing. So I still feel this pleasant tingle of nostalgia sometimes when doing these things, even though they aren't a big deal anymore. I also really like just looking at all the people who show up, enjoying their outfits and names, laughing at the random things they do, etc.
---
And that's just PVE stuff. I also do WvW and sPvP from time to time, depending on my mood. I'll never be an amazing PVPer and it tends to stress me out a little (less so in this game than in some others, because I've found that most people in this game are a lot more chill about it), but it's still fun for me sometimes in small doses.
---
Obviously those things don't work for everyone, and I totally understand how someone could get burnt out on the game, but it works for me!
---
If you don't have lean techniques you can't get to precarious perch unless the updraft which only spawns when choppers are up is active
---
I don't, I came back after the last episode to this episode, completed it and now I'm back to where I started.
---
Yeah, and EXACTLY like in ME3 the ending made me lose all interest in a game world I really enjoyed. Well played indeed. (Doesn't matter what other deux ex or Joko magic they might or might not use to bring Aurene back, the sour taste of non-enjoyment has already tainted my view of the game.)
---
All the gushing praise makes me think of how Batman 3 was lauded as a masterpiece at the premiere, and how nowadays most fans prefer to pretend it doesn't even exist.
---
Right, I also remember him saying to the branded dredge: "Stay out of the way, or be forcefully liberated!"
---
Replacing the hdd on an laptop sadly sucks.
---
Reason: The windows is pre installed on the hdd including its recovery.
---
Switching it out you would need a new Windows Key. If you go for scam keyseller sites you can get one for 10‚Ç¨ but still you have to manually find every single laptop driver for your gpu and such after. Mostly not worth the Hassle.
---
An 1 TB SSD from Samsung costs roughly 160‚Ç¨ so you are at 170‚Ç¨ to upgrade here which won't fix any issue but loading times. Ofc. You can use lower Storage Space SSD but i think you have alot of data stored on your pc or alot of other games.
---
Do you have performance metrics to back up your statement ? 
---
I'm not arguing it's not broken, but your point was that if map completion is too easy, people don't do anything else. It's not true. It never was before, it won't be tomorrow.
---
anet has no clue how swords are used, look how some swords are handled by characters, like pans
---
Yeah I thought about that while I was typing...
---
I didn't mind the swamp re-vamp as much, because yeah I was one of the people who did the 77/something/something back in the day for fast clear. But Molten Boss used to be a nice, quick treat on a lucky day, and now every frac is a drag. :/
---
I really, really, really, really, REALLY hope this is a bug, and not somebody on the team trying to force feed us an easter egg. There is absolutely no reason for those two items to be sold at some random merchant, while not at the actual Volatile Magic merchant.
---
Speaking of which, why are there still Weaponsmith and Armorsmith merchants that sell common rarity gear in the Living World zone anyway?
---
Our actors have really been knocking it out of the park. Such amazing performances. Ike and Debi have moved me to tears in the booth, and then I sit in anticipation, waiting to see how our fans will react. I'm glad that you've enjoyed their work. Thanks. :)
---
There‚Äôs no pve on dbl though.. Most people dislike that map because it‚Äôs so large and not enough action 
---

---
Yeah, they're super subtle in-game.  I think Dulfy recording it in Shiverpeaks made it look more drastic than it is.
---
Rare drop from dwarves chests 
---
Ive said this to many people and i hope this can also inspire you. 
---
There is no lasting draw to anything in life if you dont have people to share it with. Dont play an mmo game by yourself, it gets boring no matter how fun the game is. 
---
Very nice. Thank you.
---
Wait is it 85 for all of them or 85 per skin?
---
Trading services more viable? Wdym? But yes I agree that servers need to be cut down and that they don‚Äôt care for the game mode which I find sad.
---
Hopefully Kralk ate them. Good riddance. 
---
people still do ls3 metas, central tyria metas, HoT and PoF metas. Dunno why this map would be any different
---
I didn't find it time consuming, I only stumbled into the gauntlet because that dwarf kept popping up to talk to me and I found it hilarious. guess he was kinda lonely (sadface). I kept going through and yeah stumbled onto the point. :)
---
You‚Äôre supposed to be able to project your opinions and personality on the commander, and that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt have strong characteristics.
---
I am leaning towards the Joko possibility. There‚Äôs also the option of leading her back through the mists to the mortal realm, much like what we did in the PoF personal story. 
---
But I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs dead permanently. In fact, I think we are going to need her alive to kill Kralky. I know bringing her back suddenly next episode would be cheap writing, but I honestly want to move on from the all the branded stuff. I‚Äôm hoping she resurrects quickly just so we can do something else for once. 
---
I did get a little annoyed when I was trying to catch those tuna and  some random guy ran up behind me and picked up *my* tuna! Minor, sure, and probably unintentional on the player's part (everyone was new to that heart at the time and probably just running around clicking things) but why would they even make it possible? Most other content doesn't work that way, so the guy probably assumed the same was true here.
---
Yep! 36k+ AP and still going strong right up until last night, when that cheap trick sapped all of my motivation to touch the game again.
---
(And for a company depending on gem store sales, I think they might have failed to put people in a spending mood. :P)
---
Damn. Looks like another week of grinding hearts if I want to complete the ascended collection (assuming there is one). 
---
I think if they are able to find a way to make it profitable and put attention towards it, many players will return and come back and new players will join too.. People want group content. People want an MMO that can provide that. I think Guild Wars has the potential, but I feel they‚Äôre just trying to milk PvE until they die at this point. 
---
Why can‚Äôt a story line be implemented into WvW?
---
We really should have expected it (considering her visions of the future) but I feel like we didn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs close to the end of the season and people expect a happy ending, or at least one where we defeat Kralk. Seems things have turned on their head. 
---
I also believe that in the future people aren‚Äôt necessarily going to look towards the commander as a beacon of hope and that perhaps we‚Äôve tarnished our reputation a bit after this fight. I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôll have to regain some trust.
---
Fighting from the mists perhaps?
---
Yeah, the story is weak, power through to fractals and raids, that‚Äôs where you get the good stuff.
---
Christ, what a winning personality we have here. Do yourself a favor and stop smelling your own farts. You're pretending to be an expert market analyst when you're just an asshole with a pipedream with not even the faintest idea how the studio is structured.
---
Just prepare to be disappointed and stop pretending you're hot shit.
---
Hmmm... instead of more nerfing, what about changing the mechanics of how the keep works, secret tunnels to get in, new ways to enter or breach.. that sort of thing
---
I know there's tons of stuff I'll never get to, but I kind of like that. Every now and then I'll just dive into something on a whim.
---
As far as I'm concerned, I'm roleplaying the next 3 months as a fucking mama Nornbear chasing Kralkatorrik across the whole damn world.
---
rigging of some weapons on certain races and genders is flat out stupid, like greatsword on some male charr body types
---
Yeah. The only reason i think about her when it's posted, is because her perpetual meltdown and still on-going meltdown hit critical mass around the time it was released. She really shat all over all of her colleagues and their efforts that week.
---
If she was blue, maybe.
---
I think you mean Kaz is portaling, Marjory is standing beside her dancing and occasionally dropping a BL Merchant or Aviator Memory Box on top of the JP chest just for the lulz.
---
That's how this game works, right?
---
Yeah it was a nice touch
---
When faced with actual challenges, the rabid controlling types never cease to amaze us at their skill-wise inflexibility, based on what they say. Git gud or get outta the way, we got a game to play without you. Learn how to use active defense if you're behind the curve.
---
Not really true. You can mirror data to a new drive even with just a USB cable and that shouldn't corrupt the windows install. I've done so multiple times with Samsung SSDs both on work computers and personal.
---
I never done it so I can‚Äôt tell if it is or not. I did go through it the opposite way after getting the mastery point and it didn‚Äôt seem that bad. 
---
I didn't realize there was a hole in the rubble and ended up killing all the branded there before finding my way out
---
I even bought a diviner's jewelry recipe to see if jeweler could make them...nope.  Catacombs seems to be it.  They may come from the dwarven chests, but they are rare.  I have opened 20 or so of the chests and have gotten 0 exquisite serp jewels.
---
I legitimately had someone go on a vitriolic rant, call me the most ghastly names and try to get me kicked out of a guild because I called her 'unreasonable' for expecting nobody in /g chat to *ever* mention spoilers from the pre-level 80 story. You know, that content which is more than five years old now. Some people...
---
Honestly, the fractal advice is for speedrunners who want to burn through everything as fast as humanly possible. Condi classes definitely have a place in fractals, and there are enough bosses to make condi builds worthwhile. 
---
Play what you like for most of the game. Much of the build advice online is for super mega elite top tier stuff. 
---
Well, I didn't, and it's not like your peasant wishes matter to anyone of importance.
---
it's exact same place were doe stops, didn't wanted to spoil the rabbit for anyone who played the first game :P 
---
Big burly fluffy cat peoples man what's not to luv?
---
one thing i noticed is that dredge in this release have that flamboyant "omg yaass kween slaaaay" lisp, it's annoying to the point i turned off the sounds, and that skritt event that is up every 10 min is also annoying and talks weird and unlike skritt in previous maps
---
OP left out the 10 branded mass required to craft the exotic weapons but that amount is pretty inconsequential. 
---
Not even a dragon can escape the trench coats in guild wars 2 
---
But after waiting on over 5000 objectives constantly, it becomes a brain dead system. At least with mechanics it can keep things interesting. I mean, I‚Äôd find it even cooler if lords had mechanics that even the enemy would have to follow to avoid being caught in ‚Äúcrossfire‚Äù by the lord. 
---
Don‚Äôt we enjoy the fights because it‚Äôs always ever changing? Everyone having to reposition in order to win the fight, work together to sustain one another, follow the commanders orders to achieve victory. This is like a mechanic in itself when it comes to surviving against an enemy group. 
---
Why can‚Äôt the same be said for capturing objectives? Not that I am one of these players, but some players truly enjoy that pve type of content, why are so many WvW players so stubborn about bringing more players into their game mode- BOOSTING the ACTIVITY.. ü§î
---
I don't know why this made me laugh so hard, but it did. Kudos.
---
ohh we did it too, but it was painful, slow and really unpleasant experience...
---
One "upside" of the implementation of this (regrettable, in my opinion) design choice on this map is that, while I was playing last night anyway, the plate pieces can be sold on the TP.  So if you want in without doing the metas, you can get in... for a price.
---
I wound up spending 130g. 20g for an immediate buy order on a missing piece to finish the map (the meta that would have dropped it failed, somewhat spectacularly), then a pile of much lower sell orders to get plates for my alts.  Whatever I don't use I can (hopefully) resell later.
---
It was mixed for gen1 legendaries to be fair as well. Meteorologicus received no aura and got ghetto ass footfalls squeezed in last minute, while Minstrel, Rodgort, and Howler all languished in unremarkable land. Meanwhile Bolt and the greatswords were on the other end of the impressive spectrum.
---
Nevermore and HOPE are gorgeous weapons, it's just too bad that both staff and pistol are barely used by anyone in endgame PvE (only staff elementalists and daredevils even use staff).
---
&gt; move the PoI closer to the door, so you can get it just by getting close enough
---
I found out the Jahai POI is like this.  You get it doing the story, and you can get back in there by doing the race event - but if you don't get lucky it means scheduling the entire map completion around constantly checking for it.  Turns out you can just bump into a gate a bit to the southeast and ding it.
---
"Trial By Fire" achievement didn't unlock for me when I went back and did the "replay for achievements" on the last part of Scion and Champion. I defeated Branded Aurene, still had the eligibility buff when I finished the rest of the chapter (i.e. exiting to Thunderhead Peaks).
---
Might run into a bit of trouble with the 8gb ram especially in large fights but overall you should easily see 30-60 FPs depending on where you are
---
Now we REALLY need a SAB world 3. Period.
---
&gt; 2 hours after the patch there were multiple squads in the LFG allowing you to use teleport-to-friend items to get the PoI.
---
Tough luck for those of us that had work to do.  By the time I was on the map the mesmers had moved on.
---
&gt;little to no replayability
---
This is a ridiculous statement to me, if I'm being honest. We get a whole laundry list of achievements to work on during and after the story, right? Do you take the time to do those? I enjoy them very much!
---
Someone has to take credit for that fine juvenile dragon kabob.
---
Of course it is. All great stories have to have their moments of hopelessness in order for the moments of triumph to hit with the impact they should (and vice versa). All great stories should make you feel like the odds are overwhelming, and there's no way to win... until you do. 
---
This isn't the end of the story. If they left it like this, it would be terrible, but they aren't going to. (This is, IMO, one of the unfortunate downsides of telling an episodic story -- we're left with our emotions for too long between episodes, and people start to judge the whole story based on the portion they just experienced. Comics have the same problem, albeit on a smaller scale.)
---
The northern one in Kourna is the *worst*, as the event chain that leads up to it (rats event, Asuran scientist event, POI access) can bug out and fail to start.
---
Accurate.
---
A symbol depicting Balthazar appears as well during that same scene. It's above the midpoint rather than to one of the sides such that the three symbols form a triangle around the attack.
---
i have a realtec driver but it works fine for all the other games, youtube videos, etc... so it is weird that i still dont have any sound :/ 
---
The Eternal and Magnificent Joko is best at everything, you heretic.
---
&gt;Diablo Immortal
---
Oh AWESOME! Thanks dude!
---
So how about putting a mastery there, or a cool vendor, and not artificially extending gameplay by blocking map completion? It's no different than daily crafting limits, and those suck fucking ass.
---
I have no idea how you are supposed to do Surprise Supplies. The last ambush provides no supplies to refill, the supplies run out if you carry them too long, preventing all damage is impossible, and running back to previous spots doesn't work past the one spot prior to the last ambush. Have tried it about a dozen times, always failed there.
---
It's something we've come to accept as normal from GW2 especially when you look at MMORPGs and mandatory "down for maintenance".
---
Anyone else here wish those useless cosmetic upgrades could be sold on TP?
---
Look up meta builds and skill rotations on metabattle and do that. For pve, also check the snow crows website.
---
too real
---
That would be with which settings? (I'm someone who had been playing with everything on ultra low so I'm kinda curious)
---
At least this one makes sense, unlike ME3 which only left everyone confused as fuck.
---
Okay, wow.  I noticed the ghost and thought it was very interesting it was a different model.  Neat.  But that was Gwen?  Wowwwww........
---
You can purchase storage expanders.

xDD
---
I feel your frustration.  I dislike meta-locked POIs and found this map to be a headache.  A literal, skull-splitting migraine.  Something about the brand effect combined with the snow effect just... makes everything between my ears feel like an ashtray.  I've got fourteen alts to run through the map and I'm *really* hoping that headache is something I can avoid on my second go - but if it isn't, this will be the first map in the game that I want to actively avoid.
---

Yeah, but Taimi has been communicating with him since HoT, so I‚Äôd imagine he‚Äôs still out there somewhere... ;)
---
&gt;STO
---
what is STO?
---
It's a bit to the southeast of the race start.  Closer to the town than the NPC that starts the race.
---
Repeating so you'll see it in notifications: It's a bit to the southeast of the race start. Closer to the town than the NPC that starts the race.
---
Great misery is greatness too I guess.
---
Looks like quite a few are bugged (events not spawning, achievo progress not ticking). She was pretty quick about posting these though!
---
When can we get those animations on our own characters? I want that pose and also the charr floating meditation pose.
---
At least we won't need to wait for a DLC.
---
Oh wait.
---
I have to wait 5 days because I use my laurels #feelsbadman.
---
I have assumed that he's probably not *technically* dead-dead -- he's just broken down into such a state that he may as well be dead. His microscopic individial remainings pieces might be alive somewhere in a pile of crystal dragon poop, but with no way of sustaining consciousness it doesn't even really matter.
---
I was waiting for someone to say this. The map is beautiful, the best yet imo but there's no reason to be there after the initial run through? I'm left feeling bummed again. Seems only team one is up to the challenge of making maps last more than a couple days? This doesn't give me much hope for the end of this season (team three who did Kourna). To clarify, I'm only talking about the longevity a map has. NOT the personal story (which is great). 
---
I made a charr mesmer because I like playing things that aren't humans since I'm a human every day IRL.  I may not like the way he looks in light armour, but I freaking love his immersion crushing outbursts every time the some story happening and signet of inspiration goes off. 
---
Priory person: the orphanage is burning down we have to-
---
Commander: KILL EM ALL
---
priory person: -save the children
---
Commander: yes of course you can count on me STRONGER
---
Achievements and titles ought to be tied to stuff like this. 
---
This should get more attention along with other badly designed achievements.
---
"Obtainable through the story" isn't a desirable option for players with large numbers of alts.  Thunderhead's got one of those, too - or at least it seemed like it did when I completed it last night.  Tonight I'll find out if it does for sure when I run an alt through the map.
---
Accepted!
---
^^^Don't you guys ^^^^have phones?
---
So I guess I'm an actual psychopath for laughing at ArenaNet actually going through with killing her (even if it ends up being just a setback), while looking at her impaled.
---
I fcking loved it mate! This episode reminded and brought back the feeling of danger and hopelessness that Elder Dragons used to spread before the Zhaitan fight. You simply don't fck with them or you get stomped. You don't gather bunch of soldiers and yolo your way on an airship against one of them. 
---
I have noticed something when Anet kills a main character it seems to be impaling them Eir was impaled and now Aurene.
---
I'm pretty sure Caithe's brand would've been permanent if......well if it hadn't ended the way it did
---
If you are looking to be optimal, power herald is also not great. What you want on fractals is burst damage during, especially during a defiance bar break. There are also a lot of mechanics that will mean a top tier group only attacks the boss for a couple of seconds and then moves somewhere else or does some mechanic. Thus cool down based bursty classes are strong. Power herald lacks burst and most of its damage comes from auto attacking. 
---
The strengths of it are that is actually can provide decide boons both to itself and the party and has some decent utility to counter mechanics in stab or good cc or the glint heal. It isn't terrible, but it isn't really one of the stronger classes. 
---
Renegade is honestly a bit similar. The better your group, the lower relative dps you will be doing, but you also have some decent party utility in kalla elite, kalla heal, and some party boons.
---
Yeah I thought that fish in the bucket one was for sure bugged. I tried for 15 minutes, but Dulfy says it needs to be exactly centered into the bucket. 
---
I had that same feeling until I started cycling conquest PVP games, WvW and other guild activities. Doing the PVE content day in and day out really got tiring for me. I began to lead in WvW missions, and each time I did it, I would do something else: Running commander as a guardian, running an assassin squad as a thief picking off small groups. It's fun if you make it fun. But if you continue to aimlessly grind and don't set any achievements for yourself, it'll wear you down fast. 
---
I usually just ask in map chat and get a handful of people to help. You really only need 2 or 3 for all of them (with 1 or 2 exceptions). Sometimes throwing up a commander tag helps attract people.
---
It doesn't matter which one they mean -- the specs are just unlocked with HP, regardless of where you obtained those HP. I leveled an alt guardian recently and decided to unlock Firebrand before Dragonhunter, and got all the HP I needed for that from Tyria and HoT before I ever set foot in PoF content with him. Now I'm using the HP I get in PoF to finish up Dragonhunter.
---
Yeah, and dodging the fire breath attacks in the first instance..you lose the achieve if you get hit by the branded tornado.. 
---
Yes, this is the meta reason - I think they have done poorly in reflecting it in the story itself. 
---
I reckon letters from kaz and jory would be the simplest way to keep us informed of their whereabouts without them just being 'forgotten' about, so to speak.
---
Temporary? I think its permanent. 
---
In firefox, the pictures dont appear to be loading at all for me.
---
Oh real? That's something at least.
---
Your language towards me and others in this tread pains the picture of an either immature or mentally unstable person. Just take a moment to reflect on your post history in this thread. Think about how you come across.
---
dont do it then
---
IIRC, to access the chests you have to complete the meta, right? 
---
I ported into the treasure chamber (mesmer port) on one character who had attempted the meta, and did the hydra fight (I think oil overall failed though) - I didn't get the components for the seals, but was able to access 2 chests. When I swapped characters to my mesmer, I was only able to access one. Not sure if there are other chests in the chamber that have the serpentine jewels, or if a mes port can really bypass meta participation.  
---
Where was Glints body? Somehow missed that
---
It's not my post, chillout xD  
---
Probably author thinking about white flowers ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Story instance. Right where you first find Aurene. Caithe even says something when she sees it.
---
So clean
---
How the hell did the champ troll get all the way over there? 
---
Is it possible to stat-swap into a Dragonsblood weapon?
---
I do, but this is the first I have heard about this game!
---
I was thinking about that dialogue too, actually.
---
It made me wanna snap her elderly-ass neck, for one thing.
---
Not sure which one you already did, but there is a couple of Asura from personal story were one of them is stuck in that huge golem like suit. Also in the newest patch you have that mysterious inquest with his/hers golem as well, which I think would look cool as hell in your drawing style. 
---
And I love the art you've made. Looks amazing. Lot's of artists actually in my opinion struggle with drawing Asura faithfully, but you captured the anatomy perfectly, and Gorrik looks exactly like in the game.
---
I have no idea, this was back in 2012 when GW2 was still in beta
---
I'm sure even Taimi thought she would be thrown under the bus. That's why she was so surprised and grieved the most at the outcome.
---
I disagreed. It spoiled a lot of the first two story steps, which is fairly undeniable. Sure it didn't spoil the ending, as they didn't have access to it, but that doesn't mean no spoilers. They also described a lot of the map, too.
---
That's great to know, thank you!
---
I don't know anything about raid story, and don't consider it super integral to worry about spoilers. 
---
&gt;A sylvari being awakened means they had a soul though
---
Anet already shoe horned that bit in because there were Sylvari in the mists since PoF.
---
For the Dargon's Blood part of the story, you are supposed to destroy 2 crystals for the dredge. The main big one by the NPC is bugged. I can walk through it and the special action key never pops up so I can't destroy it. I've destroyed many other crystals in the area, which count towards the heart, but not the main story. 
---
I thought I was being clever by parking alts by these new mining nodes. Thanks for the info!
---
We really need dragon corruption customisation
---
I just managed to do it and I'm on the side of "hitboxes are kinda unforgiving and totally bullshit" :p
---
Same, sadly.
---
Champions had huge leash distances, like many enemies in fractals that will chase you all over the fractal.
---
Lets be honest here. Difficulty =/= fun. If that was the case we'd all be playing cat mario. It is a general consensus that losing control of your character is not fun gameplay. There are many ways to make a game difficult and fun but they really missed the memo. I've yet to have any trouble with the new instabilities, they are just annoying and a chore to play around and fractal being some of my favourite content, I'd prefer them not making it annoying and a chore.
---
I suddenly need to reinstall the game and create a Sylvari engineer
---
I had plenty to do - and at this point, doing it all again on a new account it's almost stressful trying to get it all done and get through LS4. 
---
I guess it depends on a player's interests and level of restraint. If I no-life content then I can't really complain about it, can I? 
---
&gt;Social awkwardness. I actually like this one. Sure it's annoying to be pushed by friendlies down the cliff or into some attacks you otherwise could've dodged but it is better than what social awkwardness used to be.
---
I actually find this to be the most fun ability. It's extremely simple and unintrusive: Body blocking.
---
&gt;Mists convergence was always kind of a meaningless instability in my opinion. It's nice that they added something more to it but it still seems meaningless.
---
Also a fun instability. Seeing a random tentacle pop up anywhere is fun. The canons and skyhammer add chaos without being unfair. It may be bad for 99CM and 100CM, but those are an exception.
---
She's in the area before the first boss in Hall of Chains
---
That doesn't make sense though. They never claimed they were going to get faster from S3 to S4. They said during S4 they would get faster, which we wouldn't see the results of until S5 or part way through S5.
---
At the end of the story, I was also thinking of the Avengers, except Aurene would be Dr. Strange rather than Vision. She had multiple visions that she'd die, but egged on the single hope that Kralky foresaw his vulnerability (which could be deceit, tbh). 
---
A 'temporary 'brand''
---
Are you missing /s there? Arenanet has over 400 employees.
---
I hope something more comes out of all these new awakened assets. They seem to put a lot of work into them and all we get are npc's. Some awakened-style character customization options would be amazing. I would love to play as an undead.
---
Also, with the TONS of other undead/awakened style assets added in PoF, it amazes me that anet hasn't given necros options to change the looks of their outdated pet models. How about the ability to "capture" or "raise" different undead, similar to how the ranger collects pets? 
---
you forget that sometimes after the initial rift-forming timer stops, the event sometimes just stops, making you wait another our :(
---
Hm, I actually like their Season 1 and 2 artworks.
---
So kill a creator in WvW/PvP, play a fractal with a creator or do a raid with a creator so far.
---
Yeah that was a nice touch. I immediately heard "Light of Deldrimor" after I clicked the chest.
---
Classic.
---
You and your raptor are simple not the alpha
---
I'd look online for a tier list to see what servers are currently doing well in WvW. As a f2p player, you can't access WvW until level 60 anyways, and if you choose to get the expansions, you get one free server transfer automatically. So I wouldn't worry about it too much
---
Sell raids, get lots of gold, make legendaries.
---
Not in EU tho
---
We at exactly where Destiny's Edge was when they faced Kralk...
---
&gt;I don't think the Exalted sat on their pants while Aurene was in Tarir while we were off in LWS 3 and PoF. I expect she learned a great deal thus far to have a good degree of control.
---
Rytlock doesn't know that. 
---
&gt;You see them occasionally in WvW.
---
Once, someone called that there were 6 of them on the opposite server in wvw, the map was insta-queued and I couldn't get in for the kill before they left :(
---
But ye, i'm on EU so there's that.
---
Wait, I don't understand:
---
\&gt;  Firstly, removals. ANet have removed a couple of the controversial unlocks:  Luminescent Armor 
---
they removed the luminescent armor?
---
Rytlock and Canach react pretty logically. Aurene went from being obedient to doing new and potentially dangerous stuff really quick, like eating Joko and making her own Brand. It's logical for them to be careful with Aurene, she doesn't even know her own powers.
---
Also, Rytlock is a Herald. He probably has a deeper connection to Glint than Aurene.
---
This is just a really nice fun achievement. I love it.
---
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MUCH TREASURE
---
Screw treasure when you're suffering emotional damage
---
I meant a gem store armor set :) In the beginning, when they were actively releasing armor sets, people complained that sets should be achieved in-game, not in the gem store, and that if they bought armor they shouldn't have to use transmutation charges/gems to apply it (if they paid cash for it) hence outfits became preferred for gemstore.
---
It does suck that the trade off for those complaints is that you can't modify a set by piece - especially when one element ruins the rest of it.  
---
Yasssssssssssss! I still need to get those mugs they had online...
---
You just need to get a new computer if you want better GW2 performance.
---
While it is possible to upgrade some laptops, and I don't know if this one can be, it is incredibly difficult and generally not recommended. Adding an SSD, which will have it's own issues on a laptop since you'll lose your Windows install, will make the game load faster but give 0 FPS improvements. 
---
The best option is to buy a new laptop, or better yet desktop if possible.
---
Is there class that is good in all (raids, fractals etc.)
---
Lol. I tried to roll out of the way when I saw the AoE indicator so maybe I "evaded" the damage? I got stuck, though. Spent 5 minutes trying to wiggle my way out. :(
---
Waiting for the race event in Jahai only to have it bug out was the most infuriating thing. Now having to wait for a daily reset to finish map completion on a character once per day is the most infuriating.
---
for flavour.
---
"If you fail, we all die, and the spirit of revolution dies with us."
---
You're thinking of Aurene from the player's perspective. We've got a bond with her, she communicates with us, and she's shared visions with us, as well as lending us her power.
---
Rytlock has none of that. He's seen no real communication, and I doubt he (or anyone else outside of us and maybe caithe) would feel confident in their ability to talk aurene down if she started overdoing things. Add on the ability to _brand_ people, and you can understand their concern, even if they go from 0 to 60 on the emnity way too fast.
---
ahh thanks
---
"You could live to be an old man, but if the cost was your little sisters' lives--would you pay it?"
---
This is what I did, felt very worth it... Especially since getting your first mount is so quick. Especially when you've already done it once.
---
Oh, I didn't know that.
---
Ascended ones look different and are more shiny. For example Exotic Axe has 1 blade while Ascenced has 2 blades
---
Welcome to the jungle! Smokescales don't like mounts :D
---
Nope
---
Would have been nice if they made them jeweler recipes that needs map mats to be crafted making the profession more useful instead of this bs.
---
Oh
---
I've witnessed them enough on EU. Got the PvP achievement randomly as well.
---
I did both metals twice and dwarf room too and no serpentine. We are cursed. 
---
Not with this frown! Cheer up Soldier!
---
How did you get so many? 
---
That would be awesome. 
---
You kinda need to do that at the 2nd cooling point of the new transportation minigame.
---
Shit has nothing todo with elitism. We are a lot a freaking lot maps further than core Tyria. 
---
**At this point** as a dev you have all the right to design maps for characters you'd expect to be at least almost geared up by now.
---
It's your fault if youw ant your 69 green blue equipped toons onto the map. Don't blame anet for shit you put on yourself.
---
And fuck you for trying to put words in my mouth
---
I'm probably minority but I really don't like Asura/Charr/Sylvary at all. So I stuck with Human/Norn.
---
Bye, Felicia!
---
What do you guys think would be the next expansion? I know PoF is relatively new, but I feel like there's so much to do with Cantha, or I'd just love to see a little inclusion of Hell's Precipice (or was it Sorrow's Furnance, from GW1 vanilla)? 
---
&gt; Except this is worse
---
We still don't know what exactly happened. For all it's worth, maybe we got a "control" ending. 
---
Ah that makes sense. Would be nice if they went and made some EU characters so you guys could see devs more.
---
She's just about big enough now. They could've had us ride her during those segments where we floated over Kralkatorrik. I felt a little sad and wish she wasn't dead but another part of me thinks that pulling a U-turn will take away from what was a powerful and poignant ending (my favourite part was the closing dialogue). But who knows? They might bring her back to life for 2000 gems :P.
---
&gt; Apparently chrono buffer was very important before, but metabattle says it's no longer important...?
---
Support Chrono is still very viable for fractals. 
---
&gt; And thief seems to do nothing special, brings nothing nobody else can't do as good if not better?
---
Thief brings very good DPS in raids. It has no burst though which is why you don't see it in fractals. Please, don't assume raid meta and fractal meta are exactly the same because they are very much not.
---
&gt;I know one shouldn't live and die by this stuff, but it interests me to know what comps are considered good and what professions are in demand.
---
In demand for raids:
---
* Chrono
---
* Druid
---
* Bannerslave Warrior
---
* DPS (and the most desired one will probably change from encounter to encounter - i.e. a deadeye is not going to be in-demand on Largos and a Mirage definitely won't be in demand on Keep Construct)
---
In demand for fractals:
---
* Druid (not necessary with really high end groups, though those groups are extremely rare as it is faster but requires a significantly higher level of skill and knowledge)
---
* Power Bannerslave Warrior (core or Spellbreaker depending on instabilities)
---
* Power DPS (Sword Weaver, Dragonhunter, Power Soulbeast mainly - they all excel at having really high burst)
---
* Will probbaly be in demand in the future: 
---
       * Power Quickness Firebrand
---
       * Diviner's Renegade or Harrier Renegade. Not actually sure about the latter, possibly if groups don't need heals Power FB + Diviner's Renegade is  faster but if they do Chrono + Druid is faster? Honestly not sure and I wouldn't be the person to ask.
---
Did some research...
---
1022 AE: ‚ÄúErmenred of Ascalon travels to Cantha to meet Emperor Kintah. Informal trade routes open between the two nations‚Äù
---
50 years later, in 1072: Ascalonian refugees flee to Kryta. The Undead Lich attempts to open the Door of Komalie. Master Togo summons Mhenlo to the Shing Jea Monastery.
---
Shiro unleashes plague in Cantha.
---
So travel back and forward between Kryta and Cantha, a hunt? Two new professions Assasins and Ritualists? 
---
A new expansion that will be enjoyed by old GW player and young GW2 player??
---
Can‚Äôt wait......
---
Yeah I'm hoping that her death can be used to our advantage in some way, whether that's her working in the mists, coming back to life, her death being a necessary part of the Legacy, or something else. 
---
 If Glint's Legacy is now over and we have to find a different plan to deal with Kralk/other Elder Dragons I'm going to be very disappointed.
---
Only a matter of time until LFG is filled with "LF DEV ONLY" posts.
---
This may have been the first time Reddit made me belly laugh.
---
Do you get it with a dev in squad or with a invisble gm doing shenanigans with the boss?
---
Wow didn‚Äôt realise they release tribulation mode for W3 SAB early
---
Send me a mail in game if you're NA and I'll run some HoT with ya and have you loving it in no time! I'll be on this weekend so let me know when you're planning on playing. Trixi Morrigna, Seriously I'm like the queen of the HoT maps ;)
---
That goes for anyone else new too. 
---
After playing fractals for a fair bit with FB/Ren, it really doesn't feel like an upgrade at all. Group DPS is a bit better on bosses, you lose so much utility. Doing cliffside and aetherblade the intended way sucks.
---
Just PMed you, I'll hook you up.
---
You're getting slow! What took you so long?!
---
Just kidding, thanks for all the hard work you've been putting into all those guides for all those years
---
Is it retroactive? I've done this previously...
---
* [Comment by Jonanet](https://reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aeb4ys/new_achievement_carry_the_creator/ednzkz5/?context=1000) - 2019-01-09 21:54:23+00:00&amp;#009;
---
Firebrand has a ton of utility, don't overlook it just because it's not on Chrono. Believe it or not, classes over than Chrono have utility skills worth using sometimes. 
---
The title of the achievement is a lie, I was the one carrying others :-P
---
&gt; There are almost no signs of white mantle history in the map either, which is a betrayal to the original context in prophecies.
---
I mean, the White Mantle thing was really a siege by an outsider party. They wouldn't have been there for long after mission ended, but Thunderhead Keep as a Dwarven city/bastion have been standing for years after. They would've cleaned up, you know.
---
Super Adventure Box, it‚Äôs a retro inspired 3D platformer that is open during April.  It started as an April fools joke and is now the April festival.
---
Lord of the Ley Dance Achievement is bugged. Cannot obtain it even after completing the achievement successfully 3 times. I've even attempted to move onto the next trial and still obtained nothing. 
---
Right, but it doesn't have mimic/blink/portal. That's the problem.
---
It was bad? What's YOUR point? Why is it bad? Explain. I thought the episode, music, voice acting, and new stats were great. So whats so BAD about it that you have to cry over it?
---
Same here, playing since beta, never seen a dev :(
---
Yup, at this very moment I realized that this isn't somebody to fool around with
---
I'll usually do T4s on mains then do recs on a 4fun class
---
I saw one in beta! No more tho...
---
I cried at the end. For a good two minutes. I don't know how my char will go on with the story now. I ran home to my cats and MOX
---
I liked the beta font, honestly.
---
I did, but they were on the same server. Was fun to have ANET commanding the zerg though.
---
Were you really expecting a living story patch to provide anything but content with zero replay value?
---
I also got one dropped from the south meta event itself.
---
I'm stupid and crafted the standard exotic Diviner's torch (Pearl Brazier) recipe instead of Dragonsblood because I didn't use discovery (+10 branded mass). 
---
I thought he was saying Skrittmas at first.
---
Is Joko's power going to end up being the solution to the elder dragons? Just awaken all corrupted people. I'm kind of curious if Aurene will ressurect now.
---
norn because thicc
---
Lovely flowers!
---
Any tips on Power Player, this achievement seems ridiculous stupid as aurene always kills something shes not supposed to...
---
Evil cruci
---
Won't change the skin. I crafted the exotic from recipe instead of discovery, so I wound up getting the basic pearl brazier skin instead of the dragonsblood torch. I don't know if the same occurs for ascended (i.e., not crafting the standard recipe but instead crafting via discovery panel w/ additional branded mass elements). 
---
There goes my prediction of an &gt;!Aurene Mount.!&lt; 
---
You can buy them at the Volatile Vendor in the map :)
---
&gt;Between the reduced field of view, the muted sound, and the stumbling, I really got vibes of Mass Effect 3 ending during this scene... it feels almost like an hommage.
---
You probably played with one but just dont it cause they didnt tag up.
---
I mean, this was supposed to be the endgame.  
---
Aurene was supposed to be the magic omnisponge.  
---
As we kill an elder dragon, she was supposed to absorb its magic to prevent the colapse of the magical balance.  
---
She probably already had some undead magic inside her before (which she got from Mordremoth after he consumed some of Zhaitan's magic), but didn't show any kind of change in her appearance.  
---
I believe that even if she was the sponge, she was not attuned to the magic to be able to use it (which is also probably why she had problems consuming Joko's magic).  
---
Of course it's only an assumption, but I believe she had to die to attune to it in the appropriate way.  
---
I didn't get the collection unlock. I think I misunderstood and did something stupid..  I crafted the standard exotic Diviner's torch (Pearl Brazier) recipe.. and nothing happened. 
---
That moment when devs have to make special achivement to be accepted in raids.
---
Got stuck on last instance and i left the instance thinking it would fix ghe problem but then boss just despawned and won't come back so i can't progress. Just a big empty room now :\
---
I gotcha, thanks again :)
---
The instance owner in our group was so transfixed by the moment that he forgot to start fighting for a good few seconds. It actually added to the fear of the moment, since we had to wait for our "Commander" to do some of the mechanics.
---
Why no Jump Puzzle and Diving Goggles? Seems a perfect map for both. 
---
Oooh I missed this! Where does this happen? 
---
Having Aurene get away from that just a year after the commander came back from the dead would make the story lose any grip on me, it would basically mean there is no skin in the game because the important characters always come back
---
same, took me way too long
---
I think it's more likely Aurene will live on as a fragment in Kralk's mind and work on changing him from within eventually taking over his mind - I don't think her physical form is coming back after that :'( heartbroken.
---
It's clearly a frustration-eater gaki.
---
[Gaki](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gaki) are hungry demonic spirits that feed on feelings. Like how the [Pain-eater gaki](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Pain_Eater_\(boss\)) feeds by causing pain, or the [time-eater gaki](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Time_Eater_\(boss\)) feeds by stealing time from its victims. 
---
This frustration-eater gaki has obviously kidnapped one of ANet's employees, and it's impersonating them, keeping them  alive in their own basement to maintain the transformation.
---
Then it secretly adds crappy details that will frustrate people, to feed on the annoying frustrations caused. 
---
It's the only possible explanation left for achievements or rewards that require an event to fail ever happening again.
---
Hot has this thing where fist you are going to hate it, then you will adapt then hatted more because of the grind for the mastery then a extra dosis of hate when the 3er map rolls up, but when you finish you will love it and will miss it, and will always come back (at least that was my experience for me)
---
or just think ahead and do easy wvw dailies for reward track potions. there's atleast 1 every day that's basically free and done in 1 min
---
I'd like to get these achievements too. But i really think the day i'll finally meet a dev i'll be like a crazy fan boy. XD 
---
And if i unlock one of these. Wow, it'll be my new "God among mere mortals". But maybe i like more the fact these achievements are totaly random and all about a lucky meeting. :) 
---
Last time i met a dev, it was at LA... In 2012. 
---
They're just sold by vendors on the map. Right now the inscription is on the VM vendor and the insignia is on a random merchant just outside, but that feels weird and I imagine it's a mistake.
---
It costs map currency though--50 Branded Masses. So you're probably going to be crafting 1 a day.
---
Do you have the music playing during the final boss battle on sirens reef?
---
Consider getting into roleplaying.  
---
No i'm actually being serious.  And no i'm *not* talking about ERP either (lmao).  It's not for everyone, but creating a character, a theme for that character, and finding other like-minded players whom you can explore your own themes with, is perhaps one of the most powerful things that can keep you invested in an MMO's world.  For the record: I'm not really talking about public RPers camping in uninstanced Salma District or other parts of DR, I mean like RP guilds or interpersonal groups of friends creating a story together.  It can even give you motivation to acquire certain skins you would have never suggested getting before.  Again, not for everyone, and a lot of people will probably just look at this and go "lol, playground make-believe", but the difference between RP and make-believe is structure.  Following a set of rules established within a world.
---
Haha glad someone picked up on it ;P
---
I'm going to put down electric wyvern for ranger as a royal pain in the ass too there.
---
She‚Äôs the same size as a griffin and uses the griffin base model, it can‚Äôt be over! JOKO SAVE OUR DAUGHTER!
---
Pocket raptors depend on the class.  Anyone with big AoE field kinda annihilates them.
---
&gt; Awakened Sylvari (SAY WHAAAA :O)
---
Now that i remember, wasn't a topic before where someone was RPing working for joko offering awakening, a player sylvari asked due to try to escape the violent "consort" or something like that and ended with a "we will contact you once we are able to work sylvari"
---
Because I remember it made me chuckle a lot.
---
Okay but is Anet now literally trying to get people to carry them through raids because they themselves cannot do them smh
---
where do i sign up for this carry, i can bring my heal shout engineer
---
Just promise me you‚Äôll use a Festive Dolyak Calf tonic before stepping into my machine. 
---
Why can't they just put a red line range indicator on portal already :'(
---
Any stat swapping will only give the basic Ascended skins, never the special ones.
---
HOT had better progression in general.  The thing is most of it is pretty specific to the maps so the only thing they needed to design around in a new expansion is the glider.  
---
But I‚Äôm weird. HOT was my favorite mmo content I‚Äôve ever experienced and I spent the entire first month blown away with what amazing design decisions I thought they had made.
---
Get an RX570 instead of 1050TI. RX570 costs about the same as the 1050TI but is twice as fast.
---
1050TI is really bad value.
---
New chair.
---
Holy shit, that was savage.
---
Kralkatorik is lowkey Gnasty Gnorc.
---
Sounds like a job for Spyro the Dragon.
---
GW1 reference. Not branded.
---
In GW1 the White Mantle, Mursaat, and Jade Constructs assaulted the area.
---
I remember my first encounter with the champ Troll as well. Unaware, unprepared and unlubed. It hurt...
---
A completionist? I've got you. You want to buy everything. I'm also going to out in the assumption that you play everything more or less in order, because if you're buying everything, well, why not? The story is actually half decent after the core game.
---
But that's a lot of money up front, so here's my suggestion:
---
Buy the expansions as a bundle right away as it's on sale. This gets rid of your F2P limits.
---
Play the core game and core story up to 80. This gives you a little while to ease your wallet. When you're done the core story, buy the Season 2 bundle for 1280 gems.
---
Play through that, and all of HoT, then buy the Season 3 Bundle.    
---
Play through that, and all of PoF.  Depending on how quick you go through, the Season 4 bundle may be available at this time.
---
Yeah, but we only have so much endurance before we get bored. Alliances aren't going to change that, and even those are probably months away
---
I remember raiding with you! And you outdpsed my holosmith so you actually carried us :(
---
I thought I would ride away gloriously in the tank when they arrived so I hop in the back only for it to drive away without me
---
But how is doing map completion being lazy and not giving effort? I'm giving 100% effort into map completion. And Anet is forcing me to now give effort into meta events. Meta events is essentially a different game mode from map completion. 
---
Also, you don't need to do a single event to get map completion in Verdant Brink. And Dragon's Stand is a very rare exception that is completely different from all the other maps including Thunderhead peaks. 
---
What good, modern, games that aren't on mobile were made with Unity?
---
The music in this episode, and all of Season 4 really, has been outstanding.
---
Maclaine and Lena and anyone else whose names I unfortunately don't know yet should be proud of the work they've done.
---

---
Did anybody notice Gwen?
---
I experienced the same error yesterday. Finally had a transaction go through. Now my account is suspended and I don't see a charge on my credit card. Now I get to wait the atrocious ticket response times... I'd prefer being able to call support about an issue like this as I just bought the full version of the game a few days ago and now I cant play until its resolved.
---
bosses aren't supposed to reset after wiping?
---
Thanks for the input, though I've got one more question.  
---
Since I have no idea how to gear this character, I don't know what BD% to aim at. I made a [build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQNAs+cncfClfi9fCGoBEgilTjqeaz2tlMAShl7sKiimA-jhBXAB9o+C37PAgyPYVh4Blg8+QAAA-e) on [gw2skills.net](https://gw2skills.net) trying to follow your advice (how I understood it at least) and there it says that I have 23% BD.  
---
Feel free to check it out if you're willing and if you can let me know if I did something wrong.  
---
Cheers!
---
Bless us Aurene
---
She appears as a spirit in the raid and disappears if you get close.
---
Adding on again: in T1 and T2, you'll be fine with random groups most of the time. The step up to T3 is quite a big one do that's where meta becomes relevant. 
---
THK was a mission in GW1 where you fought off the White Mantle, Mursaat, Jade Constructs, and Stone Summit. 
---
Can I get a big version of this to hang on my wall? Take my money!!!
---
Don't want be that guy, but historically the original versions of the clarinet were originally played with the mouthpiece upside down (in comparison to how we now use it). I think it's fair to suspend disbelief enough to think this instrument might have been intended to be played this way.
---
I have solo'd HoT story and most but not all I admit HPs with a level 80 boosted soldier armed guardian.  It takes perseverance and like you said doing some things on the sly to get things done alone or with only a few people but its doable.  I personally think PoF maps and HoT maps are equally dangerous in their own ways.  I wouldn't mind a tankish mount that didn't get one shot by stuff (someone I mentioned it to thought of a Turtle mount).
---
The way they did Deepstone wasn't bad honestly. The dialogue doesn't really affect pacing at all. It just happens while you're doing something else. 
---
Shattered Observatory is the worst offender though. Being forced to wait through those dialogues over and over and over again is probably one of the main reasons some people skip it. 
---
Once upon Istan. 
---
Meta chests don't autoloot compared to other WBs such as Jormag. This occurs even if you are alive and standing close to where they spawn.
---
Additionally, during the South meta the next event after the Legendary Oil Slug (the Champ Hydra) occurs pretty much instantly when the first ends. If you miss the chest then it is despawned after the Hydra even though the map icon is present.
---
No :'(
---
I haven't fully explored it but I feel like this is a problem almost all living world Maps (maybe excluding Dry Too and silverwastes) have. SOO much potential but not enough there. The map has details and NPCs EVERYWHERE. Nice designed mechanics and great ambient dialogue but on the long run it just doesn't have as much as for example a core tyria map. I feel like they need at least one more living world team, maybe even two more so each team has at least one full year to create a map. And even that is probably way less time than core tyria maps had. 
---
One problem this way would be that the story had the be nailed down to the smallest details even earlier. Maybe they can't to that. 
---
But overall if I look at it as a whole and the fact that I also didn't play a single core map for 3 months exclusively at launch means that I shouldn't expect one map now to have that much content. And what we get is really amazing quality and insanely beautiful map design. 
---
So your sample size of 10 out of 400 means that all of them are like that?
---
It's a joke and you're perfectly illustrating why.
---
aurene ate joko.
---
NOW JOKO IS OUR DAUGHTER!
---
I hope they would transplant her consciousness into a golem, like Blish's.
---
She was so fascinated with his golem body. &gt;!And one of the biggest part she was upset about when he died was that he threw away his immortality. It seemed to me it had hurt her the most. Perhaps she was hoping he would help her do that to herself, and keep her company in the centuries to come...!&lt;
---
The groundwork/precedent is laid for a lot of ways for her to live on in some fashion (she could fight Kralk in the Mists, joko magic, mord magic, domain of the lost tomfoolery, and other hints/threads left)- and unless they want to throw out the last 4.5 years of story, I'm sure they'll use something or other, but Aurene may very well be gone in the form we know her as.
---
In any case I'm certain this outcome was inevitable and part of the plan, in some form or another.  
---
My money is on the next chapter largely taking place in the mists, too many breadcrumbs leading to it.  We've got Blish still tracking him, and he'll surely be recuperating there, and maybe Aurene could join us there in some fashion like Eir/Snaff just popped in, at least long enough to finish her job.
---
[No](https://i.imgur.com/ZXfZkE2.png)
---
Blish is the guild wars 2 equivalent of a dreadnought from Warhammer just smaller and compact also no outer weaponry. 
---
Human female meta
---
you probably never saw one
---
but they saw you
---
anet devs can decide no to tag up or straight out be invisible.
---
Not to sound like an ass, but I always enjoyed these tales. Tales of how HoT just buttfucks unsuspecting people. Takes me back to the days when HoT was new to me, and everything felt like sheer death on legs. Maps felt like a jumbled maze (TD is still a jumbled maze). The whole expansion felt like cancer given form.
---
HoT is what led me down the path to git gud. Will always love it.
---
Use /stuck and don't move for 30 seconds. It teleports you to the entrance of the instance without resetting the story.
---
Given that the new home instance node has a similar problem (unlocks something else?), I'm almost certain it's a copy-paste issue.
---
I started after taking a break since \~2012. I had created a character in each slot, so I had a lot of "character birthday" presents.
---
The character I decided to play I boosted to level 60 using the gift booster I received -- Now I am just overwhelmed with items. I don't have hardly any bags, my bank space is super limited and I don't have the 600 gems or w/e to unlock more space (nor do i have the gold to buy anywhere near that many gems).
---
The game keeps throwing more and more items at me and I'm feeling completely overwhelmed with no where to put these items. I can't even collect all the items I get from leveling rewards -- and one of them might be a bag.
---
Please help! How can I quickly get some bags to alleviate this?
---
Why's the number matter?
---
Ah ok. Would take maybe a bit too long, dunno.
---
I only have male characters just for reference.
---
Male Norns have no necks.
---
Asura are too ugly.
---
I don't like how monstrous Charr look.
---
I have a few Sylvari cause they're cool looking.
---
I mainly have humans because I like to pretend I am my characters and I myself and human believe it or not! 
---
"Did anyone not crash when the new Meta Boss was at 20% HP?"  
---
Now I know why the Deldrimor plate is so expensive on the TP btw... :(
---
It would be cool to have the option to make it round
---
All according to plan!
---
Savage.

I jumped up the right hand side of the mountain and did a combination of Springer &amp; Gryphon up the right side of the waterfall ledges on the right-hand side then glided over and down to the left. 
---
Yeah, THP is honestly somewhat disappointing compared to Jahai. It feels like another Kourna, but the episode itself is redeemed by the instanced content and overall polish.
---
Thats what i did, but the normal ones respawn and aurene always kills them before i can pull the vet into the circle.
---
On the plus side, unlike many of these other achievements, this one will be easier to complete in a month :V
---
as someone who completes world/hot/pof maps every couple of months with different toons and has played the likes of ESO, WoW, FFXIV and multiple korean mmorgs out there.   
---
I completely disagree with this statement. **To me**, almost every single map in gw2 feels "loaded" with players even at "bad" hours, and when not, usually there's a group up on LFG trying to accomplish insert random silly event/achievement here. Never in my life have I played a mmorg with such "active" old content as this one.   
---
Low population at certain hours in some areas are noticeable of course, especially at small maps like lake doric, and new events/maps usually hurt completion of old content for a couple of weeks. But if the opportunity arises **I dare you to remember this comment and come back to this map in two years, just too see meta events and the likes remain with at least a 30+ player base even at 4am**  
---
Meanwhile in WoW, maps become ghost  towns where there's not a single soul to be seen after 2-3 months.
---
Random one. I did report it in game a while back but it's related to sound settings. I use Windows 10 but probably the same on other opera if systems.  I've noticed if have your audio device in game as Default.  Then change your default in windows from the sound icon, the games audio doesn't pick the correct device. Though you can select a different one in game and pick default again to reset it. Just thought I'd let you know.  I know it's probably low priority 
---
Difficulty ramped up in Seasons 1 &amp; 2  living world, so without S01 being replayable, and without buying S02, there will be a rather large gap in difficulty. 
---
How do you unlock the new "Bond of Faith" mastery? 
---
Matters if you want to get armor and weapon skins bound to those achievements. At this rate it would take a couple of more years.
---
It's not *that* abstract. See that? The lights are eyes. Just turn your head a little..
---
Female Human, because of April Stewart. I *love* her voice. 
---
Blew my mind as a child, back when Final Fantasy 6 did this. Damn world got destroyed!
---
I'm personally not finishing the story until I've got this last PoI for The Hammer's Hoard, and I'm extremely frustrated that there's apparently a way to get the second plate, but it won't even drop. I'm pretty sure at this point that it's not just a random occurrence anymore. On top of that, being locked out of that area to get that bugged second plate until I can get involved in two successful meta events or can catch someone who can help me get back in (because I've already run that part of the story and got disconnected afterwards) is not what I call a good time.  
---
As Gorrik put it, it's inconsequential but extremely disruptive.
---
Train it and have 5 mastery points over after your exp bar is full.
---
Curious, EU, NA, or... is there a SEA server? I can't remember....
---
I mean it doesn't show up, my bar is just blank.
---
Taimi is waaaayyy overdue.  Can't wait for that one TBH.
---
Yeah Shamefully it felt more like "oh well, rushing in with all we got didn't work out as expected.. Come on commander, do your thing and kill this borky snake!" 
---
How many developers, or rather Arenanet employees are currently in Europe? Or even in comparison to our playerbase. What are the chances? :D
---
Open up the trading post (default key O) and search up "18 slot" in the bottom tab. You can also buy from WvW (Pillager's pack or something) if you have badges of honour that you aren't using for anything else.
---
I've met you in the game, on EU, you played Necro with tons of minions, male human, in Aerodrome. I whispered you and we "played" some pvp. You are a Legend and true community spirit. Happy to have you and hope to meet you again :)
---
The game lets you dance on top of her body. And so I did. Why would they even let you do that. Especially considering all the effort put into the details for thi chapter.
---
***GOOD.***
---
I hate Branded Devourers. Shooting their stupid crystal projectiles and hitting me right when I'm trying to switch mounts. I like that it's dead.
---
Check if you really activated to train the mastery, when it's greyed out you usually just continue to level up and get Soul Shards as usual when you're max mastery level.
---
To clarify, he doesn't count as "there" anymore when he jumps in the air, so stacks can't be removed as long as he hasn't come back. 
---
Can I take you up on that offer?  
---
I only play support roles so I'll gladly let you outdps me lol
---
I'm also gonna add this; I love Caithe's new voice and design. I just wish we got to see more of Aurene's Branded before she got killed.
---
Speaking of: Is it a new voice Actress for Caithe or is it the same as her original? I feel like they're testing the water for Zojia's return.
---
Do you have anything in the Crystal Champion Mastery track at all?
---
Have you completed the latest storyline quest thing?
---
I just did the fish one, it needs to be pretty much in the centre and since they fly so long it's really only one spot where it's doable (as far as I'm aware).
---
&gt;  It's your fault if youw ant your 69 green blue equipped toons onto the map.
---
Interesting you say this, then immediately follow with
---
&gt;  fuck you for trying to put words in my mouth
---
In any case, I'm not talking about what gear my characters have. That argument is irrelevant to the point (though be it an interesting strawman), which is that a poi on most new maps - that should otherwise be easy to get - have been locked behind content that relies on multiple people.
---
It's the joke, which has some basis in truth, that developers are far more skilled at developing games, than actually playing them. So you can expect that a new player loses badly to a developer, who understands the systems, but that same developer loses badly to the highly skilled players in the community. In reality, the devs are usually all over the skill scale. From "Hopelessly Horrible" to mediocre to "Excellent Exsanguinator".
---
The NPC gives you the special action skill and "exchanges" your plate with another coloured one (which will appear on your character's back like a stowed shield). You go in front of a the locked room that has the same coloured plate above the doorway, and interact to place the plate in the interactable circle outside the door.
---
Once that's done the outer circle becomes a teleporter to inside the room. You will use the special action Light of Deldrimor skill to find hidden chests in the room and you'll also need to find a coloured plate hidden somewhere in the room, which you will use to unlock the next coloured room.
---
This goes on until you get to the treasure room. Make sure to use the special action in the treasure room to reveal the hidden chest where the jewels drop from.
---
And good thing to note: the treasure room seems to be the last in the "chain;" there doesn't seem to be any coloured plates in the room, so I guess it's a way to gate the amount of chests and as well as the achievement.
---
And I will chase it back to you
---
She's not dead, she's just *mostly* dead. And when has death ever stopped the Commander?
---
OOoooh. Haven't thought of that. Now that I heard it, I think this is most certainly the way they are gonna go. I would personally hate it since it trivializes death so much. But this is such an Anet thing to do lol.
---
I can't help but notice Mario is rotating the WRONG way when he flips off Yoshi. When did he do the 180 in mid air?
---
The place used to be infested with Mursaats in GW1
---
If you do the same content over and over you will feel burnt out. Try changing game modes from time to time. PVP and WvW.
---
Come back? Dude, this whole season was about life and cheating death.  
---
Of course she'll be back.  
---
She ate Joko she has his magic. He was able to come back from the afterlife afterlife.  
---
She absorbed Mordremoths magic, who beforehand absorbed zhaithans magic.  One more source of dead magic.      
---
She also absorbed Balthazar and can potentially travel through the mists in a similar way as Kralka can (and can therefore come from the mists also). There's also Livia and her knowledge about the scepter of Orr.   
---
The whole first mission was about Glint telling us about the crystals and that we can attune them to use their powers..  
---
Aurene is a crystal dragon. She wasn't just talking about the crystals but about her too.  Simply put, her death will attune her to that aspect of magic that is already inside her.  
---
The unthinkable act that Glint mentioned, wasn't the attack on Kralkatorik, since she attacked him in the past. Obviously that makes it pretty well thought.  
---
At first I thought the unthinkable was her dying and severing the bonds with her champion (as Caith explained, Aurene loved us to the point it almost hurt. She would never want to leave us behind and therefore would potentially be the unthinkable act).   
---
But after a while, I remember that she has seen the vision of her death too. So she knew she was going to die already.  
---
It was practically prophecised.  
---
The unthinkable part might as well mean her coming back from the propheciesed death.  
---
Let's not forget that Glint wanted to talk to Aurene about the ascensension privatelly. We don't know what she told her.  
---
Maybe dying and being reborn is part of it. After all, Glint in the end of the instance said "a better world is waiting to be born." which is an interesting way to say this.  
---
Don't forget that we need Aurene as the omnimagic sponge. Without her the magic would get out of control again. 
---
Train your masteries
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more! 
---
When you decide to go ahead and use your 30-day login reward for legendary mats because you figure you won't need the 20 laurels right now...  
---
I guess the laurels never changed from being the best choice. Hard lesson.
---
Confirm :) Met him in game he's great!
---
oh no
---
OH NO
---
WE'RE GETTING KORMIR'D AGAIN BOIS &gt;.&gt;
---
Braham, is that you?
---
I liked the absence of the 'Mission complete' sound effect following completion of the last mission. It would have felt out of place.
---
and pocket raptors
---
I did Slothasor once on EU a few months back, that's all we did though because you had to leave.
---
Am I able to get it too? :)
---
Whoa this is surreal, thank you so much!
---
I need a Carry the Player achievement instead.
---
so how are we going balance the magic now???
---
Two weapon sets, two hidden weapons, a ton of weapon-specific tasks and collections for those weaponsets, 2 meta events, a LOT of little secrets, amazing verticality etc. You're just ignoring a lot of aspects in Thunderhead, especially when you look at your comparison with Jahai.
---
PMed.
---
Well then, I'll play support too, but then you gotta out-boon me. 
---
That should be pretty easy though, I'm pretty awful at support.
---
And something I only realized an hour ago: after you finish the story, Varya, the president of the Dredge, is replaced by her daughter, Aya.
---
I want to find the Music that goes on in the forge- it's so subtle and pretty
---
Isn't it one of the achievements that wont show up in the UI unless you already completed it? So it wont really detract from anything.
---
Once this is active, you cannot enter vaults. So it is impossible to rush it just right before reset, for example.
---
Oh man that sounds phenomenal. I wish i had a way to test out these runes.
---
PMed. 
---
Sometimes Sloth makes me want to ragequit :-P
---
Maw becomes immune below 8% of health. A single crystal thrown will kill it, but if everyone dies no crystal is thrown, hence boss doesn't die.
---
Yes! Tougher mounts are PARTICULARLY needed in PoF I think.  
---
Minionmancer for best class 2019. Hope to see you around sometime in the auodrome again!
---
It's epic by Living World standards.
---
Totally upstaged Kourna's little skirmish.
---
But it will never beat HoT's entire Dragon Stand meta.
---
The final confrontation with Mordremoth in his mind and the battle with the Mouth on the physical level, with all the regrouped Pact members and allied races still feels way more epic.
---
The mind battle may be pretty simple in terms of planning but the Mouth meta is definitely well planned and executed.
---
Larnthir's commands during the final boss phase also helps bring out the feeling of a coordinated attack and I keep playing DS meta for that one reason.
---
If only people can coordinate and CC on third bite .-.
---
&gt; Two weapon sets, two hidden weapons, a ton of weapon-specific tasks and collections for those weaponsets
---
Which is pointless if you're not interested in those though. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the time and care that went behind these weapon sets, but we're already drowning in weapon skins, unlike armor sets (which felt like a better selling point but that's a matter of taste I guess).
---
But fair enough.
---
&gt; 2 meta events,
---
Already mentioned these. They play once every hour, last 15 min max and there's hardly anything to do in-between. 
---
&gt; a LOT of little secrets, amazing verticality etc.
---
Unless you have a griffon (and I do), the verticality doesn't do much. It's a nice change of pace compared to previous map, granted, but it's just that: a map design. Gameplay wise this verticality is hardly used: there is no event to rush us into the voids to collect flying elements, there is no griffon race, there is no leyline for the gliders. Just. Void.
---
&gt; especially when you look at your comparison with Jahai.
---
I really don't know if I'm being biased though, because Jahai definitely feels more alive with its tornadoes, its rift, its constant flow of events. Surely I'm not the only one who feels something is missing with the new release?
---
One of my favorite little voice lines in this episode I stumbled across while playing through a second time with a friend last night. In the camp, there's a Vigil soldier writing a letter to her daughter back home, reading it as she goes.
---
A few times she pauses to rewrite a line because, "What if I die? If I say it like that, she'll think it's her fault..."
---
She ends by just telling her to be good to her uncle, say her prayers, and that she loves her always.
---
Something about this simple little monologue hit me really hard with the weight of the episode, and made me want to go through the chapter yet again, just to see if maybe I can find that character somewhere in the final battle, to know if she'll be able to go home to her daughter someday.
---
You bet! Although it won‚Äôt be a carry lol
---
I hate to be a misery, but I found the QC quite bad on this episode. On multiple occasions I had to log in and out because where I stood became covered with rocks. I wouldn't mind so much if I was trying to break out and got stuck, but this was just playing the story; not to mention mounts which also landed me in sticky spots, despite their being no good reason why (e.g., in the final fight, if you try to fly down, there's an invisible wall above which can trap you). Likewise the camera changes broke on multiple occasions so I missed Kralk entering the Auditorium. Disappointing really when the story was OK. 
---
That's so nice of you, thanks :)
---
I'm not saying this goes for everyone, but a some people already got all the raid/fractal achievements, did all the achievements in open world that they wanted to do, and have no interest in pvp. Raids and fractals don't stay interesting for over 2 years after initial release, and with current balance aren't even fun to begin with
---
I was shocked to scroll through the story achievement screen and see only one achievement with an award: the meta achievement giving the Corsair legs. Not even volatile magic or a mini for any other achievement. It makes the achievements feel barren and meaningless.
---
Also, the heart vendors don‚Äôt sell anything but map currency and minis. As someone who doesn‚Äôt care about minis, there‚Äôs basically no reason to ever do the hearts unless I‚Äôm grinding out the purple crystals.
---
I agree, this release just feels super anemic.
---
Honestly it would be pretty ballsy to keep her dead, and I‚Äôd actually kinda like it.
---
On the other hand, they just gave Caithe a new purpose after not knowing what to do with her for a while, and there‚Äôs so many hints like Ogden mentioning Joko‚Äôs passing was important, Glint having a secret talk with Aurene and Aurene probably having some of Joko‚Äôs lich magic in her as well as Kralky‚Äôs face being partially Aurene-branded in the last cutscene. Just makes me think she‚Äôs only dead temporarily, or if she stays dead she will somehow still have done something to move the plot forward.
---
Also, Aurene died to him in every one of her visions, but Kralk also saw a vision without him. Feels like her passing was going to happen either way then, but Kralk is also going to die later on somehow. 
---
Dunno, there are like 24/7 mesmer portals up if you take a look at lfg. Plus it's not really meta locked if you can buy the meta rewards over tp. Prices will likely go down in a few days or weeks too.
---
They can't just drop Awakened Sylvari and not give us THE GODDAMN CULTURALS. COME ON
---
Theorycrafting:
---
&gt; dragon can see visions of the future
---
&gt; dragon foresees death
---
&gt; dragon consumes Joko in a way that seems awkward at the time
---
----
---
&gt; [... Profit?](#s ... body gets bodysnatched next episode by an unknown faction, and having nothing better to do than sulk, you decide to follow them, and suddenly, you have dragons getting raised from the dead because a group of the fanatic necromancers think they can bring back their leader if they free him from the dragon that consumed him.)
