I mean, even while watching TV and reading magazines, you're processing information and learning new things, or improving in some way. Even simple relaxation is a growth experience, so I respect folks who are looking for that. And if someone doesn't want constructive feedback, I'll respect that too. But my default attitude, if no one tells me otherwise, is to help. That's what I find fun.

---
---
By the armor stats you mean is it like ESO that in endgame pretty much although there is a meta that makes tou 2% stronger, you can combine different sets depending on your playstyle?
---
Rytlock is a consummate warrior. Perhaps, and this is a *huge* perhaps, given the game's mechanics... Perhaps the next update would see him using a spear.
---

---
We already have spears in water, and it's been rumored that we're eventually going to get more underwater content at some point, for the sea dragon. 
---
I could see Rytlock taking up a simple spear in an update that gives players the ability to use spears on land... And considering how important the Dragonsblood spear(s) have been, I could see that becoming a thing.
---
I think killing Kralkatorrik will require hits from *everyone* on our ragtag team of misfits, and I think Rytlock will get the penultimate blow before we finish it, or he'll make the coup de grace itself while we keep Kralk busy.
---
Snow Crows builds are built to be the best at raiding as possible, and usually they map extremely well to fractals but Chrono is sadly a case where it isn't perfect. As a solo Chrono it's very hard to keep boons up in fractals without 100% boon duration. 
---
That being said, you'll probably be more than good enough even if your raid gear isn't perfect for fractals. It's not the worst thing in the world if you have too little boon duration in fractals and it's not the worst thing in the world if you have too high boon duration in raids. 
---
Support Chrono is a lot of fun to play, and is the best class to get into raiding with imo, so I do highly recommend it anyway.
---
Feel free to ask any questions about the spec if you have them!
---
1) the story is...decent. It starts off with some decent rpg choices, but the story writing itself was lackluster. The writing has gotten better, but at the expense of less and less choices and more linearity as time as gone on. It's all followed one basic theme though, deal with the elder dragons
---
2) living season is the "free" content between expansions. If you are online during the initial release of the living season content, you automatically unlock it for your account. If not, you have a pay a small price to unlock it. It tells the story that takes place between expansions to your character, along with expanding the world and introducing new content
---
3) PvP has two modes. sPvP which is 5v5 matches where you try to maintain control of point nodes, and WvW, which is server vs server vs server castle siege. Outside of that, there's PvE endgame which is a lot of open world content, large scale map events, fashion, etc, along with fractals (dungeons 2.0) and raids. Fractals are 5 man instances and raids are 10 man (need expansions to access)
---
Save your money and buy a new MoBo, CPU and DDR4 memory later.
---
The money you'll spend now won't improve your gaming experience, it is better to wait more and have a much better system later.

Not even *randomly*, given that the Flame Legion was explicitly looking for it.

What do you mean on 2) that if I am online during the initial release? if i am actually playing the time is released or if i havent played for ages?

hol up do i know you? i had this as my discord username

That and she stabs him in the leg with a paring knife when he's leaving her.

And she tells Imperator Ruinbringer that 'it was to make it look good.'

I doubt that. I think it was personal because he was choosing the sword and probably getting himself killed over staying with her.

And poor Kas looks pretty artificial.

What *did* Eir do with Magdaer after recovering it from the Ascalonian Catacombs, anyway? 
---
every 2-3 months we get a new living world episode. If you're online before the next episode comes out at any time, then you unlock the episode. So we're currently on season 4 episode 5. If you play anytime before season 4 episode 6 comes out, then you'll automatically unlock episode 4 season 5
---
It likely varies by individual, just like with cats. In Sea of Sorrows, from what I remember, Cobiah specifically mentions how some of his charr friends' fur dulls, gets flecked with white, or starts to grey in certain areas. And by grey I mean the follicles lose the ability to produce pigment so it fades from whatever colour the fur was to white, not that a charr with orange fur suddenly goes actual grey. (Though orange domestic cats can and do develop black fur/skin patches with age, so if charr go that route it may be possible for orange charr to start getting black fur).
---
Though how often charr live old enough to get visibly grey is another matter, and who knows what spending so much time in the Mists would do.
---
just make more charr until you have each of the legions and the buddy options covered 
---
if i buy the expansion will i get all the seasons?
---
Personally I'm hoping anet embraces all the comments about rytlocks look in this art and adds a skritt acting like rytlock(maybe shadowing him and mimicing) at some point. 
---
I knew that ArenaNet at some point was setting up some "he has family we weren't aware of" story threads on the side, more complex of a reveal than this, but I believe they got abandoned in the last year or so. This is easier to deliver on, I guess.
---
The guess is now, how old are these cubs? Is his oldest old enough to.... say.... *join a guild?*
---
it's something like 200 gems per episode, which, looking at the exchange right now, is 68 gold 52 silver 47 copper. It generally floats in that range, cheapest getting to around 50 gold. 
---
In context, doing some of the fractals every day, that's...3-4 days of daily fractals? And that takes maybe an hour per day in a PUG, less in a static group.
---
So once you get to level 80, grinding out the gold isn't terribly hard. 
---
You see, there are these asura named Occam and Hanlon...
---
Seconded. I opened a few the other day, got the nice yellow box.. oh, another one of these pieces of shit.
---
None of them. It's not worth it on that platform and none of those chips is gonna do anything for GW2. It's atrociously single core dependent. Either go Ryzen (one of the R5's would be my recommendation) or go Intel, the i7 7700K is generally thought to be the best Intel chip for GW2, that thing is/was a single core beast. Personally I run a R7 1700X and have no issues (oc'd to 4.0ghz). But that list bud, just don't, you'll be wasting money, you'll get literally no performance gain, and I'm really not exaggerating on that :/

Edit: Spelling

it's not like it takes any significant concentration to look at a map and think "go that way"

I've never had T4 groups ask for KP except for CMs and not that many of them ask for KP's in my experience. 
---
Here's how I joined T4s: I did T3s enough that I learned the general mechanics of the fractals, I joined a T4 group and hoped for the best, and 95% of the time it works out, most of the time they aren't that much harder than T3s. The only real hiccup is people not understanding Viirastra in 100.
---
 Not my Rytlock. 
---
Yeah, the reporting tool is pure garbage.
---
This is awesome!
---
Ugh idiots
---
Pretty much what Pie-ne said. Armor in GW2 gives you a set number of stats in a combination alignment (berserkers is power damage, crit chance, crit damage) that gives you different number values based on the rarity of the armor (normal, fine, masterwork, rare, exotic, ascended/legendary). Once you get to ascended, nothing is higher (legendary gives same numbers, but stat swapping for free to ANY combo!)! The jump from exotic to ascended is SUPER small, ascended is really only needed to minmax numbers, and for “ar” agony resistance, for fractals (think FF14 super hard trials).
---
No treadmill, just, more plates of food to choose from!! And they just keep putting more plates on the table!
---
So, once you hit ascended, the only way to do more damage, is to improve your rotation!
---
How does one even make it to T4s without learning wisps? Did they quit back before that was a thing?
---
I'm kinda glad you said that; it was outrageous to read. But at the same time, I have very little faith in individual people, so I wouldn't put it past *someone* to do this.
---
Any tldr?
---
Well, it *was* intended for use *by a god* after all...
---
I find the main thing is just remembering the skips. The rotation is pretty braindead these days.
---
I really really don't might got carried without intention through this fractal never having to deal with them since other people were faster.
---
You can actually do a new boss "casually" too: Conjured Amalgamate is definitely easier than Samarog/Gorse. Lets you get some gaeting crystals too
---
&gt; I don't know much about all this, but what's the use in the spyware hashing processes?
---
Think of the hash as some kind of fingerprint. So they took fingerprints of all the processes you were running. If they saw a process they didn't like, they banned you.
---
&gt; Is it simply just to identify them as some unique string of numbers/symbols and flag them as potentially illicit?
---
Hashes are essentially algorithms that take an arbitrary amount of data, do some computations with that data as input and return a fixed length value. So you can take a file, for example, run it through a hash algorithm like MD5 and you get back a 16-byte value or a 32-character string that represents the data inside that file. The same data will always result in the same hash value being calculated.
---
The idea is, that if you have two pieces of data that both result in the same hash value being calculated, chances are good that those two pieces of data are identical, as there is only a one in 2^128 chance that two different pieces of data have the same hash value in case of MD5 for example. So the chance of that happening is astronomically low. One in 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 to be precise.
---
&gt; I looked up md5 and also found that is has some naming collisions, so is it possible that the spyware can accidentally hash a legal process to the has of an illicit process, making another false ban?
---
Collisions are possible with any hashing algorithm. However, chances of accidental collisions are incredibly slim as mentioned above.
---
&gt; Sure there are differences. But in the context we're talking about, all visions are prophecies, but not all prophecies are visions.
---
Aha, and you got that from where?
---
In the game are specific differences between visions and prophecies. Prophecies like the flameseeker or the dwarven one focus on the result. XYZ will happen, without paying too much attention to how this result is reached or who do what and when, so it keeps very much space for different ways to reach the result. And like I said eralier, all prophecies made in GW became true, or other way around, no one was false.
---
A vision on the other hand is just an insight of a possible future scene. A very specific thing, an absolute picture of what will happen. That's why only one vision won't confirm what definitely will happen in the future. 
---
Prophecys can be made out of visions, sure, but it's *not* the same.

i doubt they should hold good features just because 0.1% of players gonna be screwed, they can make it so in this case you can turn excess copies into tradeable again
---
I assume you mean the Bloomhunger wisps and not the starting wisps? If you mean the starting wisps I have no idea how they never figured that out.
---
They specifically want the option to submit more luck than having to click over and over for each submission.  Allowing them to convert luck into higher tiers does not resolve this.  They would still have to click over and over to go through their luck.  
---
Think of it this way: let's assume that someone has 1M luck.  Being able to craft 1K pieces or even 10K will not resolve the problem of them still having to click multiple times each time they want to submit luck to the NPC.  All your suggestion does is reduce the max number of times but that wasn't what the OP was asking for.
---
Eh, beginners could join a raid training discord and stack up that EXP just killing cairn and VG
---
Oh, wow, that's hot!
---
&gt; I can't believe how many people missed that this post was satire.
---
There is sometimes a truth hidden in satire. I remember the fire elemental farm. Nothing compares to the toxicity in that one, not pvp or raids.
---
In game money isn’t too hard to come by though... you can make enough for two chapters in a day if you try. You can also make around 15-20g (about 1/3 of a chapter) in an hour in some places. Just need to be level 80 first (which, the chapters are level 80 content anywho.)
---
I DO think you need to have the first expansion(HoT/Heart of Thorns) to play S3, and the second(PoF/Path of Fire) to play S4 though... keep a watch, they go on sale a lot! Sadly the expacs are IRL money only I believe.
---
I know this is meant as satire, but in my experience his whole post was pretty much spot on truth.
---
I just want chaos gloves damnit
---
The artist is amazing by all means and I meant no ill, still, staying on-model is what you always wanna do when drawing already establshed characters.
---
Oh damn, this gave me chills. It looks like it could be from a GW2 game on another platform, or in another rendering style. Cel shaded GW2? Yes please.
---
Can you post or send a message of the script? I am looking for one to use and haven't found anything. 
---
&gt; I had in fact taken a few months off from the game, and upon returning, couldn't log in, which prompted my email to support. They informed me I had been using an exploit or rule breaking, and terminated my account. An account I had played on for years, had bought gems several times, had worked hard to develop (had world explorer, several legendary weapons, etc). All gone, poof, and there was nothing I could do.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I wrote email after email, and met with stony refusal to do any investigation. At one point they even sent me a copy of their game rules, like "Here, you figure out what you did." Only problem was, I knew I hadn't done anything. I hadn't even logged in, in months, for personal reasons. But I've played MMO's for ten years and I'm extremely careful about following the game rules. I never, ever, do anything shady; I won't even swear in chat. I thought perhaps my account had been hacked during my absence and asked them to please check for suspicious IP addresses, but again, they refused to do anything.
---
This cuts deeply it's the same as how I feel on many issues with anet.
---
&gt;dps player that pulls less than 7k
---
Haha, reminds me of the time I joined an EXP Deimos (half hosted by a guild but the other half they had to pug?) and the 3 thieves in that guild were doing &lt;9k dps. Anyway I left after a couple pulls because it was obvious we weren't clearing. 
---
&gt; Prophecies like the flameseeker or the dwarven one focus on the result.
---
Uh, the Flameseeker Prophecies [literally details the entire course of events](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Flameseeker_Verse), not just results.
---
&gt; And like I said eralier, all prophecies made in GW became true, or other way around, no one was false.
---
In all honesty? [Nope.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prophecy)
---
You listed two prophecies that did. That doesn't mean all do.
---
And those that do come to pass... are almost always manipulated into occurring. Or based off of reoccurring past events.
---
&gt; A vision on the other hand is just an insight of a possible future scene.

"Possible" future depending on which timeline theory you're ascribing to at the time. In Guild Wars' case, all futures are possible futures, since futures are never set in stone.
---
&gt;  A very specific thing, an absolute picture of what will happen. That's why only one vision won't confirm what definitely will happen in the future.
---
An absolute picture is... rather contradictory to your claim that a singular vision is fallible...

I mean, she's our daughter out of wedlock, but...as a Sylvari main, I'm not opposed to the idea

I'd like to see ticket scraps guaranteed. Basically the only reason why I get semi-exited when a key drops.

You can only do that for the 7 outfits which used to be town clothes. All outfits released after the outfit system was created are only 2 pieces, helm and body.

You will also need to get new RAM if you upgrade, your current board only supports DDR3 and any motherboard you get for a modern CPU will only support DDR4.

I've run into toxicity in every game mode, pvp, fractals raids, wvw  none of it ever compared to open world pve stuff like the fire elemental farm. Numbers alone does not explain the extra toxicity. 
---
Not sure how this pasty white dude is Elonian, but it looks great.
---
I call bullshit, or one specific incident with one group. Or you've had really weird luck, I guess. I've played this game in the open world for more than 6 years. I've done every meta, every boss, and close to all the events. I've seen some toxicity around certain events rarely but it's by no means a rule.  Nor is it a rule in any other game mode.   
---
There is far more toxicity in SPvP though than there is on open world PvE by a long shot. 
---
Nah it's the eyes. He looks like Tybalt. Rytlock has a much heavier set of eyebrows and correspondingly deep-set eyes. Whoever drew this put wayy too friendly of a face on him.

So although the guide gives a good general strategy to complete this fractal, I feel that it is worth mentioning that there is a much easier and quicker way to complete this fractal. Instead of killing all of the initial adds, you can simply stack stealth by blasting smoke fields and run to the bridge where you need to kill the elite (or be lazy and get a Chronomancer to port you). If your group struggles with killing the elite shaman with a few extra adds around you can always stop just before the bridge and kill any adds that have followed you. 
---
The other thing is that common in T4 groups and normal in CM groups, is killing the firestorm first as with reasonable DPS the bosses don't last long (at any tier) and trying to attack the firestorm in the shock wave just isn't fun. 
---
I realise new players to fractals may not want to try more co-ordinated strategies but honestly they are worth a go as it will be less of a shock when progressing to higher tiers (when strats do change) and make the fractals easier to complete especially with some of the new instabilities due to the amount of mob spam at higher tiers. Take a look at the [Discretize](https://discretize.eu/) website as it has guides for every fractal, class builds and other useful tips including blast stacking and consumables that are commonly used.

&gt; Uh, the Flameseeker Prophecies literally details the entire course of events, not just results.
---
Did you even read it? Alle prophecies literally only show results. 
---
Also keep in mind that the details are only in your head, because you already know what happened. You know what happened and this story fit perfectly into the prophecies (well, thats what prophecies do), but it's not the only possible way. Just for example,  Ascalon and Orr could easily be switched and all prophecies could still be true. 
---
&gt;In all honesty? Nope.
---
Eh.. yes. If you mention the not fulfilled ones, you can see that none of them are even valid.
---
&gt;Which... is what a prophecy is... insight into a (possible) future scene... 
---
Didn't you read what I wrote? I even explained the difference....

&gt;An absolute picture is... rather contradictory to your claim that a singular vision is fallible...

No... it's not at all... it's absolutely consistent...
---
I give up, I don't know if you are trolling or just don't read my posts, but either ways, it's not worth to continue this. This topic could bring a very interesting discussion and different views an certain points... but not this way. Not in a way, where one side is ignoring almost everything the other side says...
---
At this point I will end this discussion. I wish you a nice day/night, hopefully we will get a bette discussion next time we met. 
---
I typically am under the idea that "If I have messed something up, especially late in the process, it is best to finish the product rather than worry over every minor detail and then note the issue for later reference". This is typical because most things I draw I do so for my own sake as opposed to for a professional job. 
---
Regardless, I thank you for being the most direct critic in the comments section. While it is bitter, I cannot argue against many of the issues you have brought up. Digital is not my strong suit, with charcoal and other physical mediums being easier to work with.
---
I will keep these things in mind for future projects. Thank you.

I guess someone already said it, but you could possibly use those 2500 gems to gift your wive the missed episodes. They wouldn't be "free" this way of course, but at least you wouldn't need to put money into the game and you could still try out the new content (it's good if you ask me, but it's totally understandable if you couldn't stand the game anymore anyways).

Could you by any chance make the font even smaller? It is way too big right now! /s
---
I think they meant PoF raids are more difficult than HoT raids, but I could be wrong.
---
i know about this website, i was honestly wondering a few days ago why isn't it adopted by people since it's basically impossible to fake
---
but..it doesn't have killproofs despite the name? kinda ironic..cm titles aren't enough since most lfgs are for normal mode
---
has a weekly clear checklist but not all all-time one at least? 
---
Started a new norn a few hours ago Eir was the same way
---
Unfortunately, I'm fairly certain the next weapon for Rev will be a main hander. 
---
Anet seems to be following a pattern with their weapon assignments, making sure every slot gets one weapon, but only one weapon.
---
In HoT, Mesmer received an off hand shield, and in PoF, a main hand axe. Elementalist received an off hand horn, and a main hand sword. Necromancer received a great sword, and a torch, and so forth. The only exception to this is warrior in PoF, which received dual daggers. Presumably, this is meant to be seen as a 'two hander' weapon.
---
Gave it to "a blacksmith" she knows to mend the pieces. Never explicitly said but it's suspected to be Beigarth, the best norn blacksmith at the time. We've literally never heard from it since.
---
Wow, that big brother is dumb. He could have given gold ore, which is only half as much.
---
This casual raid remind me of the old time when I lead group of newbie to get into raid. It was before w5 release. People were chilled and willing to cooperate to kill boss.
---
Now most pug are less impatient, easy to rage quit if things doesnt going well. Player base has been changed, which cause me decide to quit raid. Anyway wish op find chill guy and make casual raid guild great again

There could easily be more than that given their dialog in [Plan of Attack](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Plan_of_Attack):
---
&gt;**Rytlock Brimstone**: I hope this works.   
---
&gt;**Rox**: (spit) For luck.   
---
&gt;**Rytlock Brimstone**: (chuckle) You used to do that when you were a cub. C'mon, let's get this over with.   
---
&gt;**Rox**: Something's happening. These ghosts don't seem to like your sword very much.   
---
&gt;**Rytlock Brimstone**: They're going to like it even less in a few minutes.   
---
&gt;**Rytlock Brimstone**: Damn! They're possessing what's left of Barradin's statue.   
---
&gt;**Rox**: Someone once told me nothing worth fighting for is ever easy.   
---
&gt;**Rytlock Brimstone**: Ha! You do listen.   
---
&gt;**Rox**: Only when I feel like it. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The story didn't really seem like Rytlock either. It's like they tried to cram his life's history and every "sad" moment into one short story to leverage it to hit home with the death of Aurene and it came out not seeming like Rytlock.
---
I think the Sohothin symbolism is really reaching with Rytlock's story, they crammed in the link to Balthazar after the fact and then tried to build on it retroactively with this story but it just feels like tacked on baggage rather than a cohesive, well thought out character journey.

[dT](https://discretize.eu/) is a great source for fractals but they have a completely different setup to the raid build. If you use the raid build with raid runes you hit 66% and at 150AR mobility potion gives another 15% duration. 81% is more than enough to keep up boons especially since you should be prestacking with the singularity. Honestly very low boon durations can still keep up quickness and alacrity but I'd never recommend them since they allow for no mistakes or mechanics. Something like [this build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQNAs+cnsICFoh9fCmfCUrhFVjiMAGhirsDKhBouZn2qF-jRSBQBA4kAMxHAwfVrwMKBpkqKBWZwVU6hH9CEZ/BSBs7wN-e) (Slightly modified raid setup) will still work just fine. You could swap a ring and two accessories to diviner as well and be over cap (with 150AR) anyways. 
---
Interesting. I wonder what the age difference is between them.
---
But wait, I just realized: Rytlock specifically thinks about his cubs back in the Blood Legion homelands. He laments that he will probably never see them again.
---
That would be kind of an asshole thing to think if one of his cubs is *right there, hanging out with him for a few years now.*
---
There's no way Rox is his cub. She's gotta just be someone he met early in her life.
---
Not arguing that but even then way before the picture leaks someone leaked almost every single aspect about the expansion. Mounts, location, and they went into detail for almost all of the elite specs. 
---
In text. It was dismissed right away as a fake. Fastforward and it came to pass. You never really know man. Always take it with a pinch of salt.
---
Apparently all seven Kormir fans appreciated your art.
---
Ok I can follow what you're saying about the mesmer and elementalist examples, but otherwise...what are you talking about?  I'm not trying to dismiss your theory or say you're wrong, but there is no way to tell what the class will be given next.  
---
Suppose there will be another expansion (hasn't been confirmed, but with the current state of the game, we all know it's going to happen) that introduces new weapons.  Will the Revenant be given one of those?  Or a current weapon?
---
It's a good assumption to predict a main hand weapon using your formula.  Herald = shield (off hand) and Renegade = short bow (two handed), therefore ??? = main hand weapon, but what if a developer decides to shake that up and give revenants another two handed weapon?  They gave Spellbreakers two new weapons, why not do something unconventional next time as well to keep players guessing?

"halp" is just a fun and meme-y way of saying "help", it's not weird or anything. I use it too, often because it sounds more playful, and "help" sounds to me more serious, like "get the fuck here I need help". Not when I'm dead though.

actually they can, they were withholding information when OP submitted a GPDR request and flat out lied to another person who commented when they claimed that they do not keep the information that he requested, which was clearly a lie. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation
---
**General Data Protection Regulation**
---
The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR") is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. Superseding the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements pertaining to the processing of personal data of individuals (formally called data subjects in the GDPR) inside the EEA, and applies to an enterprise established in the EEA or—regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship—that is processing the personal information of data subjects inside the EEA.
---
Controllers of personal data must put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using pseudonymization or full anonymization where appropriate), and use the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the data is not available publicly without explicit, informed consent, and cannot be used to identify a subject without additional information stored separately.

You should definitely do this. The absolute most fun time to raid is when new content is released, because it's a puzzle to figure out. By making a guild like this, you'd be giving yourself and all your members the gift of that sense of discovery for all the wings. 
---
Just don't be too mad at information leaking in. It'll happen, the knowledge of the meta strategies will seep in and you'll eventually end up doing things in the meta strategy. It's inevitable, so don't let it bother you. Adapting to the meta strategy is also a process of discovery and also lots of fun.

Pretty much. The only other faction I could see having as much of a desire to get the artifact would be Ascalonians, but they pretty much fell apart, with most just integrated into Kryta and the remaining either being Ebonhawke or separatists. I'd imagine they had a few expeditions here and there but it just didn't end up being worthwhile. Also, there's probably the complicated issue that on one hand, if the rumors that the sword could pacify the ghosts, then the Ascalonians could put their ancestors to rest. On the other hand, that would mean the char would not have to spend as much resources combating an endless ghost army, which will allow them to be much more powerful, which I'm sure the Ascalonians don't really want, even with the recent alliance.

Gave it to Malyck before she died. 
---
Already tried. Hence i'm trying my luck here since i believe the audience would be bigger.
---
I just want it to give me something other than hairstylist kits when I have a permanent one. It can recognize other items you already have unlocked and give you an extra key instead of that item, I wish it would do the same for the kits. Or, let me trade them for a few lion statues or something. 
---
It was dropped as foreshadowing.  They scattered hints of the White Mantle throughout Dry Top and especially the Silverwastes as Season Two was progressing, with the payoff coming with the first raid wing that followed after Heart of Thorns' launch.
---
throughout vanilla GW2, it is heavily implied that the general human bandit faction are funded by the WM - in the human personal story especially. the silverwastes were previously bandit outposts before getting evac'd, hence the badge.

I'm a brand new 80 doing something horribly wrong on my p/p deadeye when it comes to DPS but I can't figure it out. I'm using a build off metabattle and I have pretty much all berserker exotics.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Deadeye_-_Power_DPS_P/P
---
I'm doing my DPS testing on the 1M HP golem and with all the boons turned on I'm only doing about 8.5k dps which is apparently close to autoattack levels of DPS. Unload is ~80% of my DPS and according to arcdps it's hitting for 539/1661/2643 min/avg/max per shot. It hit 487 times in 116s so that's about 61 * 1.5s = 92s spent mashing that so it doesn't seem like I have much more uptime to gain there.
---
Statswise, I'm at 2602 power, 49% crit, and 206% crit damage unbuffed which seems in line with a full exotic sample build:

---
Where is the extra damage supposed to be coming from?
---
You made me very curious on how Runescape (of all games) is able to tell story so well that it ended up as your benchmark.
---
I mean, does it even *have* a main story? If so, what about it makes it so special to you?
---
Oh and have you ever played single player RPGs? What makes you look towards MMOs if you want a well told story?
---
As long as you aren't running any third party software that hooks into GW2 you'll be fine.
---
Boon Druid. Very fast revives, great uptime on prot, regen maintains the scholar bonuses really well, and you can burst heal when needed. You can also amplify damage a lot of glyph of empowerment, frost spirit, and storm spirit. Flexible and large CC contributions without sacrificing the core of the build. Easy as hell to play, especially for a support spec.
---
Honorable mention to Firebrand specifically because of Aegis - that's a real pub-pleaser there. Even if they don't notice the 'Blocked' popup, which means they just assume they're doing it properly.
---
Druid's get the satisfaction of seeing them dip to 20% then shoot back up.
---
Chrono isn't quite the carry-machine that people make it out to be, the group kind of has to know what's going on in order to get the most mileage out of Chrono.
---
Soulbeast/Mirage/Holo.
---
We have had all kind of wacky builds before, but those 3 enter the category of oppressive, they are a meta check: 
---
Can your build beat them or can it not? Probably not so roll one yourself or get rolled away.

It's a cool meme and all, but the game's core design principle is for it not to apply and legendary crafting isn't where it fails
---
Sigil of Strength and Forceful Greatsword will stack, so when you crit you'll get Might from both sources. Forceful Greatsword will give Might when you crit at 100% chance, all other weapons get 50% chance for Might on Critical when you have the trait equipped. Both those will also stack with Fried Golden Dumplings or other Might On Crit foods.

Nah, [Occam's](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Occam) a Sylvari, and he already made a [razor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Occam's_Razor).

---
Actually [Occam](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Occam) is a sylvari.

does the toon need to be lvl 24?

let's not tell Canaach about the new one

SJW isn't an insult. Fighting for just causes is noble.
---
The people mistakenly banned weren't either.
---
I'm running several servers as different users on the same machine as GW2 is running on and I was not false-positive banned.
---
If this was the entire story, wouldn't all players who were running antivirus software or had system services of any kind be banned?
---
And given that the software specifically filtered the hashes before sending *only* the ones that matched known cheating tools, the list ArenaNet sent back must have contained only the detected hashes. And that means that the *entire* list of detected hashes should have been the md5 of an empty string.
---
And given how good ArenaNet's operations have been so far (the longest downtime *ever* was when the EU datacenter literally exploded, and nobody lost any data), I'd expect the "chief of security" to be able to notice that there's only one hash on the entire list and maybe Google it or something.
---
This entire thing seems fishy to me.
---
No, but the trick is to find skins that look like other weights. It can be a fun part of Fashion Wars.

I'd never send an item first if someone else is seeking it. They pay first then you give. That's how trades should always be done in a non trade window game. Seeker pays first crafter gives second. Better not to be scammed if you're the one using all your mats.

Great rebuttal, I concede to your statement full of facts and convincing arguments.
---
Best: Anything that offers multiple ways to complete the heart so I don't *have* to run around killing trash mobs, but the option is there if I'm not feeling the activity.
---
Worst: Anything that takes forever and relies on slowly-regenerating mechanics like the fences you gotta fix for that one norn's alehouse, or any heart where you're expected to kill things that were outsted by a meta/event like some ogre kraals.
---
Dishonorable mention to literally any heart that goes back to empty at rollover. Fuck every single one of those.

They’re becoming an endangered species for sure. I love Renegade and all but sometimes I like to switch it up and play Herald too. I’d love to see it make a comeback in PvE :(

The outfit also has a yellow glow effect around the hands and feet , that I didn't see in the preview. It was very noticeable once I was wearing it in-game though.

Hello! Trying out [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Forceful\_Persistence](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Forceful_Persistence) on my herald. However, I don't see it on my buff bar when using upkeep skills (Impossible odds, any of Glint's facets). Is that normal? Thanks!
---
That's the sound of your endurance bar filling halfway or full
---
I’m gonna be real, 2500 gems is honestly more insulting than not getting anything at all.

2500 gems means someone sat down and calculated the value of not being able to play for 6 months and actually came out with the number.

You will be disappointed by GW2's gear. It's just stats and a hefty grind to get a full set of ascended which amounts to 9% more stats.
---
Would be hell of a processing sink for barely any difference if charr models had whiskers IMO. Or it just didnt look as good as it should have and they were left out

Pretty sure you can avoid timegate if you buy the whole item on tp rather than crafting the timegated component.

Sword weaver is one of the highest DPS builds atm. Perhaps you meant to type something else?

Hi, I think the instructions for using the tool might not apply for everyone.
---
I spent several hours troubleshooting it, hope this can be stickied somewhere so more people can try this method:  
---
1. I also encountered error messages when extracting the zip file to the game root folder. What worked for me was  to open the zip explorer and drag the "d912pxy" folder straight into the game root folder.
---
2. As for the "bin64" folder in the zip file, it does not work for me to copy the contents into the GW2 bin64 folder (replacing existing files). It only works when I copy the entire contents of the "bin64" folder in the zip file straight to the game root folder where you find the "gw2-64.exe" file.
---
3. Additional tip: If you are using other tools that require you to replace the d3d9.dll file in your GW2's "bin64" folder, it will also stop this tool from working. I was using the gw2hook tool previously, and the DX12 tool only finally worked when i deleted the entire "bin64" folder from GW2, and started up the GW2 launcher to create a fresh "bin64" folder.
---
Hope these steps help.
---
To the OP, you may want to consider not putting all the .dll files in a "bin64" folder so that the extraction can work properly.
---
&gt;s funny. I just wish it didn't go in this direction.

You can only loot the Resplendent Chest from Green Room once per day for 3 Serpentite Jewels.

Of course, you can also run around and loot the basic chests, but they have a much larger loot pool and do not guarantee a Serpentite Jewel drop.

This is a stepback. This doesn't add anything to the greater picture of hopelessness and it even undermines Rytlock's character. I'm all in for backstory but this was floppy. It should have been told by someone else, or in much fewer lines in real Rytlock fashion. 
---
Also, what is the setting in which Rytlock is monologuing. Logan's there at the end, so it's definitely trying to be a real scene, but who does Rytlock open up to so emotionally at first. He's not even talking to be Commander. Rytlock wasn't the person to be staring into nothingness slackjawed and blabber about his heartache.

The part of the software that caused those false positives was removed from this program a long time ago. This won't affect new players at all.

I've lost a lot of trust and so far they didn't do anything to win it back, so I'll probably stay away. Other than that I still believe you can't gift episodes, unless something changed in the last 9 months.

Like I said I wont spoonfeed you. But you can take these excuses elsewhere because I'm an artist and I see through that bullshit. If you want to be just a hobbyist thats fine! But using charcoal instead of pencil wont magically make your anatomy/proportion not shit because tools are just tools. Your knowledge translates no matter which you use.  And you are right, people dont do over every minor detail they do when its major tho. And you are fucking major. If you legitimately believe art fundamentals are too minor to fix then we really have nothing to discuss. Make your excuses if you wish but then dont be suprised people dont like your art. 
---
So if you arent planning on getting better please refrain from posting it on this subreddit, it's not an art subreddit and your skill is too low to catch peoples attention to be worth posting to them.

Their support team is constantly condescending to customers, that isn't new. But hopefully some of the support staff can start looking for new jobs, and maybe this problem stops happening over and over.

Yes, that personal story made a lot of references to the White Mantle and "The Unseen" which is another term for The Mursaat. (Watch WP's Let's Play "Bonus 5" for a run through)

Of course the end of both the White Mantle and the Mursaat were subjects of Living World Season 3.  Thank Balthazar!

yeah i know that, but i never see that particular alehound pre event tho. I always see the other 2 pre event but not for alehound. So i thought i need to do something to trigger the pre event specific for alehound

You can see what boons, buffs, and conditions the [rotation video has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrVITQE67TI), snowcrows also has [benchmark info](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) if you click on the "buffs" golem in the top left of bosses. Besides getting your food sorted out, full ascended gear with infusions is always going to be ~12-13% higher DPS than exotics so you'd have to factor that in as well. Also note that you should be behind the golem and making sure not to mess up the rotation (it's really simple but goes pretty fast and minor mistakes add up to a lot of DPS loss)

How can you compare a rev elit that casts forever an uses almost all his energy to frostaura?

Mate. I don't need you gatekeeping a community you have no authority over. Get the stick out of your rear and don't insult a person's art if they're simply having fun.

If you joined as DPS and said you were joining as DPS and not support Chrono then it's kinda their fault to not have noticed you were DPS. Power Chrono is a very solid build for fractals an d you can also bring a the same utility a support Chrono can so yay for portals, blinks, reflect, stealth and such.
---
Btw if a LFG asks for "Chrono" usually they mean "Support Chrono" and not "Power Chrono", just in case that was the source of the issue. But because you join with a Chrono you have to really specify that you come for a DPS spot and not a support one because a lot of people who see a Chrono will assume it's a support Chrono in PUGs.
---
And you're rude.

Everyone says Signet of Malice is the best, and I see them reference these crazy numbers. I'm only level 19 and my Signet of Malice heals 12 on attack and 256 when activated. Is this supposed to level up? Am I supposed to be feeding it points or something? I don't know what I'm doing wrong; if someone could explain to me, I would appreciate it.
---
Sorry for the noob question, thanks.
---
There are likely at least six Blood Legion tribunes out there working under Blood Imperator Bangar Ruinbringer if Blood Legion follows the Iron Legion's system. Ascalon has two Blood Legion tribunes: Rytlock and the sadly often neglected [Fierhan Sparwind](Tribune Fierhan Sparwind) (who I hope will have a bigger role in a potential future Blood Legion storyline to contrast Rytlock's views). :)
---
As for the Stone Warband not being seen in game, this recent short story suggests it's because Rytlock has grown distant with them partly because of his earlier hubris on relying on the feeling of empowerment Sohothin gave him over relying on his fellow stripling 'bandmates. This neglect, as well as Rytlock's reckless actions with Destiny's Edge in the past, may have soured their relationship with Rytlock to some extent. If Logan is to be believed, each member of the warband (there would be 12 males and 12 females in the warband based on Rytlock's explanation in Edge of Destiny) is now an officer in the Blood Legion Homelands so they don't necessarily have the time or desire to venture into Iron Legion controlled region of Ascalon at this time unless Bangar commands it:
---
&gt; **Logan Thackeray:** Truth is, I've never met his warband. They've been together for so long, they don't adventure together anymore. Not like guilds do. Every one of them is an officer in the legions, I believe.  
---
&gt; **Pact Commander:** So they're all politicians?  
---
&gt; **Logan Thackeray:** Soldiers. Military officers who take their duties quite seriously. [(Source)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Origins_of_Madness:_A_Moment%27s_Peace)  
---
It's possible there's even more going on behind the scenes than we've been told, and this friction in the warband may be explored in the future in a potential Blood Legion centric storyline.
---
And yes, I do hope we see all our respective 'bandmates return in an open world map, or at least in a story instance, now that the devs can work with phasing technology and have phased, chatty NPCs follow us (e.g. Blish in Episode 4 who is otherwise seen as a prairie dog by other players). Would be nice to check in on the current Legionnaire of the warband (our sparring partner whom we promoted after we left for the orders) as well as other members of the warband to catch up on old times and maybe have them jab at us for not being in contact with them for so long. :)
---
thats throwing away money but you do you.
---
&gt;Also, what is the setting in which Rytlock is monologuing.
---
Internal monologue, or stream of consciousness. It doesn't entirely compromise his character given that it's all self-reflection, and his outward actions and words remain aloof. His interaction with Logan seems appropriate, as Logan is Rytlock's closest ally and these two tend to speak more through silence than words.

Also, to the other redditors in this thread, please stop using the downvote as a "disagree", as that's bad reddiquette. If you take issue with the parent comments views, comment with your view.

The fact that there are many sources of generating Fire Shield is why it concerns me as a flat 10%. I think toning it down a bit would be a better idea — even 3% damage would still be way better than what it is now and wouldn't shake up things *too* much by comparison.
---
I'm also kind of torn about making aura sharing a Tempest-only trait instead of Water, but it makes sense in the grand scheme of these changes (and frees up your ability to choose a different perk for Grandmaster water). Overall I like the theme of what the OP came up with, but there's definitely room for number tweaking.
---
Wait you did 5 map compelition in a row?

I asume GW3 is gona be sooner.

All LS3 trinkets can be statted as diviner's, so it's actually not as hard as you think. You can get an amulet from three days in Draconis Mons, if you're lucky. 
---
I did two days in Thunderhead Peaks so I could convert an ascended sword and shield and I'm converting my accessories and stuff over. I can still do respectable DPS but am more group-friendly.

That's only 2 legendaries.  You simply cannot stop there.

---
I'm a complete noob at raids, but I'd love to try this, I don't know my tag from memory, so if I could add yours that would be awesome! 
---
But that is literally the thing: We as the commander don't have access to this information, and I am quite sure that is totally on purpose. If they added it in game via an journal (why would Rytlock write his thoughts down in the first place?) or via a vision from Glint (who is dead and doesn't really deal with mind-reading) it would mean the commander would know this, and that would force a change how the commander interacts with Rytlock.

this is not addressing your primary concern, but doesn't the IG golem back item from sand swept isles have PoF stats too?

I'll be honest, when I just saw the thumbnail I thought "Oh great another art of a skimpy female, haven't seen that a bazillion times before" ... was pleasently surprised.

I've been avoiding spoilers as I haven't had time to play lately so RIP that attempt...

I'm an EU person who mostly plays NA myself. For me it was a mix of finding friends on NA and having some drama happen to me on EU that led me to focus more on my 'murican account. I also got lucky with fractal/raid runs because said NA friends do happen to have time when I am online, even though they're either NA and just happen to have free mornings, or are EU themselves or OCE and happen to still be around when I am.
---
For LFG, yeah it can be a bit of a pain. But if you have a foothold on NA contacts makes it a lot easier to not mind the time zone difference.
---
Also some people who are partners with Arenanet can switch regions as they like, maybe those QT/SC players you've seen are partners? No idea about that though, just guessing. Or they are simply alt accounts in case some friends they know on NA need some help to fill out their fractal/raid group.

Boon Chrono is nice but tbh only invest into it if you wanna play the build because the gameplay and role are very different. Not every Chrono need to be able to play all the builds linked to Chrono, otherwise you can start asking DHs to play Power Firebrand for good measure :p

I've switched my character to Leatherworker but since he already has levels I'm not able to salvage for the low tier materials that I need (Rawhide Leather Section) and I haven't found any creatures that drop them, even in beginner zones.

I'm not gay but that guy is.. hawt lol

Boon table in Arc is VERY heavy on resources, especially in WvW (and also big Open World metas, but who uses that there?). Might be some memory leak problem, for example. I would send log to arc creator, maybe will be able to fix the problem thanks to that.

This is amazing! I really like it =D

Sorry, no sugar coating.
---
Skritt revenant with red mohawk ?
---
&gt; I see the same, although finding groups in T3 seems to be even harder for me most of the time.
---
The issue with T3 fractals is that T3 fractals start to really up the difficulty compared to T1/2. And most people fail to adjust to that, they're used to steamrolling through the lower tiers, and suddenly hit a wall where they're not as good as they think they are, and can't rely on carrying people either. That's why many people advise others to skip T3 fractals and go straight into T4 ... which in turn of course means they still don't know how to deal with many now-difficult things, but T4 has a higher chance of getting players in your group who know their stuff and can make up for your lack of skill/experience.
---
You can probably make it feel more heavy and impactful by slowing it down 25-50%
---
Guess what - I do play for quite a while and have never known there is such a thing. I might just have put UI Volume to minimal and some point and never noticed. Thanks!

besides trinkets and BP, they simply dont know what to put on the heart vendors anymore. the whole reward structure in season 4 is not good. minis, tonics, gizmos... evrything is already in the game in abundance. (the teleport gizmo in sandswept was neat though) how many branded minis alone did we get this season? :D

they have to come up with some new rewards for next season.

EA lost against Belgium now. Law is a slow process. I expect more gambling legislation around video games to come eventually.

Don't you bully Runtlock again.

As I said, the premise was that I enjoy douing the ones I listed. I am and was aware that more is possible but I just don‘t really enjoy them as casual daily runs. Besides, p sure CoE can be done with thieves and haste and shadowstep. Not entirely sure though. 
---
...I love it
---
Not entirely on topic but if you just want airship parts without effort, park a character on the matriarch. Gives quite some for 1-2 min of work. 
---
Well tbh - in "average" EU country by having "average" job if you spend money you earned in 1 day you can get as much gold as you'd get from doing t4 fractals everyday for a month.

Cauliflower.

Honestly, it's a grind but an easy grind. Bitterfrost has probably the easiest route but it's a bit brain-numbing. I find Draconis Mons more enjoyable and it's always quite active.

Ascended gear is account bound, so you can give another level 80 character a head start with the gear you don't need. 
---
Plaguedoctor's is a perfectly valid attribution of stats. And don't let anyone tell you otherwise!
---
THat wouldn't encourage anything as veteran wvwers play for gameplay itself, not ranks / pips and they would stack and stomp anyway.
---
I honestly still haven't done a single Fractal yet. I've just about everything else except a Fractal. Would love to try it eventually if I find some peeps to show me what's going on and what to do.

Better waiting for HL3

Pretty obvious that one of the current companions gonna die before we put down Kralk for good, it's standard pattern in the story, my bet is sadly for Rytlock

**Tsundere**
---
Tsundere (ツンデレ, pronounced [tsɯndeɾe]) is a Japanese term for a character development process that describes a person who is initially cold (and sometimes even hostile) before gradually showing a warmer, friendlier side over time. The word is derived from the terms tsun tsun (ツンツン), meaning to turn away in disgust, and dere dere (デレデレ) meaning to become 'lovey dovey'. Originally found in Japanese bishōjo games, the word is now part of the otaku moe phenomenon, reaching into other media such as maid cafés, anime, manga, novels, and even mass media. The term was made popular in the visual novel Kimi ga Nozomu Eien.

Well, starting wisps was a problem of coordination (starting running without caring if all wisps are assigned to someone, multiple people acting afk-ish).
---
But yes, main problem were bloomhunger wisps.

I was talking about ppl that have x8 stacked
---
Well, we got a [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini\_Kormeerkat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Kormeerkat) so a Skrittlock mini can end up in the game either imo
---
I would give weekly reward chests depending if your server wins/loses with measures that scale down reward for transferring servers etc. Eligibility for reward could be based on few factors (minimum playtime could be rated by pips, need also other checks to make sure player just did not go around repairing walls / escorting dolyaks in safe locations all week).  
---
Idea is inspired by the rewards at the end of ranked seasons in competitive PC games based on your max gained rank before season ended etc.
---
I think it is simply the fact that they chose the three who are least likely to actually share their thoughts and feelings with the commander in-game.

For me win10 is mix of operating system and bloatware/spyware so n, ty. I will use windows 7 till I get  PC able to run win7 virtual machine with hardware passthrough while using linux ubuntu as main operating system

Linux supports DX12 through wine - so I think you’re fine :  Windows 7 prob has the same bloatware/spyware it’s a case of configuring win 10 to disable  it

I hope there's more to her inclusion then "we need a black character"

This might get downvoted but i would love to see Revive Orb or Teleport to Friend. At least until the permanent version is here. But the voucher would be perfect but i just dont think that they are That generous.

But what about blish

Oh shut up.

Does Arenanet do refunds? I just bought the Jackal skin by itself a month ago for this price and they release this now? =/

Currently FA vs YB vs BG is Shit storm of zerging. FA has always done well on open field fights. We still have our favorite pugmanders but have definitely lost some talent. Unfortunately I don't belive FA has been open for transfers for some time but you could check the other two. 
---
I think it is more "we need an Elonian".
---
There are a few Elonians just outside of the group (Redeemer Kossan, Sayida the Sly, Zalambur), none are real fighters.  Zafirah is a Deadeye, a PoF profession.  I think we have two HoT elite characters Braham is a Dragonhunter, and Rytlock is a Herald.
---
that's slow, not dead. just because it's not enough for you doesn't mean anet should axe the game (you really think they could produce more content faster in a new game?)
---
Do a 10 necro full clear.
---
Don't worry about that and jump in. T1s are fairly simple and meant to introduce you to fractals so that you can learn mechanics, and mostly have new players. For  level1-19 you don't need AR as well. 
---
So join the groups for T1 daily's and see.
---
Sorry, but that is an illusion. That's the same old excuse we had for years when people say "we transfered for fights". Nobody ever did that. People stacked the good fighting guilds on one server and got bored because no one was there to fight them in the end, Look at the old maguuma. There was a lot of fight guilds around that ended up "magically" on the same two servers and of course died over the years because the servers they fought couldn't fight that back and started playing the game with sieging up and ppt.
---
Remember the start of the game and the Alliances on NA that could basically steamroll everyone? That was never a game issue, but a player created one and easy to solve too.
---
Isn't it obvious she's gonna replace Rox, who plans to stay with the Olmakhan?

The latest map has some pretty good access for ascended weapons

Not defending Anet here because their mistake was huge and inexcusable, but they [did not actually log everything, and only sent the hashed data they found violating their ToS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8c2j0y/a_technical_analysis_of_the_spyware_arena_used/dxgz47x/)

While they made a lot of questionable decisions, I'd rather not claim they breached someone's privacy when they didn't.

That's no pimp suit &lt;,&lt;
---
Herald is not a support spec, really. Sure it shares boons around but it's at best designed to be able to complement a support spec, just like it can complement a DPS build. The Power Herald build in PvP is a pure DPS one.
---
The shield 5 is not like what we see on other classes because it roots you and is the only shield skill to do so. That is a major disadvantage in PvP because it basically means you're just delaying your death rather than preventing it, you can't use it to prevent pressure while kiting, moving out of AoEs or back towards teammates etc. 
---
Hefty grind for ascended what? Hefty? Really? Did you ever play any games that actually have grind? Here you play the game and obtain ascended by whatever you wish to do. Rightnow with the festival you get 150g for free enough to already build quite a few pieces.
---
Instant purr-chase for mew.

That sounds amazing, I only have the bug mid-cutscenes. I think it'd be awesome as a character armor and even weapon skin. I find it more awesome than funny.

I have somehow never heard this sound before what the heck.
---
There is no game out there who can offer content that last for a longer time to veterans there just is not possiblillity for any MMO to give this and the same post show up on all forums with the same complaint from people who played since start and/or have thousends and thousends of hours put in to it. 
---
For this to happen they would have to put out a expac every 3 month or less. It is simply not something you can expect. I mean even after a expac there are people after a week moaning about i am done (all though they are not they are just done with the things they enjoy the rest is still there). Again this happen in ALL mmo which shows that your expectations of a game is way out of line. 
---
But that's Canach's job.
---
Rarely.
---
Design decisions like that are often caused by the vocal part of the fanbase. If they demand a character to be black, to be gay or whatever else that is going to happen.
---
Of course that also means that their blackness or gayness is the central aspect of that character because it's literally the reason the character exists. 
---
That's just how supply and demand works.
---
Now it hinges on what came first: 
---
- If a character was already planned out and was diversified after the fact due to fan demand the character might at least be decent (see Jaal in Mass Effect).
---
- If the design started with "we need a diverse character" then we're pretty much doomed (see many other cases).
---
Good short story, and good artwork aside from the one, little important piece of it. You know, HiS fAcE?! 
---
I get that every concept artist is different, and he's actually heccin broken in said scene, but the eyes! I just wanna whip out my tablet and fix it! I know Anet keeps changing their mind on what Rytlock's eye color is, but soulless void is probably my least favorite to date XD

There's a big plot from PoF which deserves resolution: the fate of the Forged. Sure, we got Utumishi's claim in "Small Victory (Epilogue)" that the Awakened were routing the remaining Forged who may or may not have fallen into disarray following Balthazar's death. Sadly we don't know how reliant Forged conditioning is to Balthazar's well-being, but I still find it odd that the Forged, many of whom were veterans from the Eternal Battle which had lasted centuries if not millennia, would've lost to the relatively newbie-ish Awakened even after such a setback. Devona/Herald's scrolls in PoF ("Night of Fires" mission) likewise mentioned the unnamed General of the Burning Forest who had travelled south to prepare for Balthazar's arrival, but we never met the General whom Devona respected in any of the open world maps to my knowledge, and it'd be unfortunate if the General had died off screen.
---
Now that Zafirah convinced at least some of the human Zaishen to return with her to Thunderhead Keep to fight alongside us, their former enemy, perhaps she can replicate the feat by acting as our emissary to the surviving Forged. The great tragedy of the Forged is that many of them were antivillains at most, being forcibly subjected to Balthazar's brainwashing to fight in his name while their doubts about the justification for the campaign had been silenced as seen with Devona's own hesitation towards the end. If any villain group deserves redemption, it'd be the Forged who should now be fighting under the revered General of the Burning Forest. The Forged were made with modified Exalting rituals and thus should be as immune to dragon corruption as Exalted are, which makes them ideal troops to fight Kralkatorrik with. :)
---
It would also be interesting to see Zafirah's reactions to Central Tyrian Church of Balthazar in contrast with her disgraced Elonian branch. Granted, we saw the Tyrian High Priest of Balthazar make chicken noises back in Season 3 Episode 6, but I imagine that not all Tyrian Balthazar worshippers are as childish as he is and would likely try to get to grips with the fact that the Commander not only killed their god but is now trying to more or less accomplish the same feat as Balthazar did, which some Balthazar acolytes might find incredibly frustrating without realizing the real reason we had to stop Balthazar back then.
---
I'd also love to see interactions between Zafirah and Kasmeer. Here are two religious people of somewhat opposing ideas. Zafirah has come to terms with Balthy's passing but found renewed hope via sensing him inside Aurene, while Kas has understood that humans have to fight their own battles without relying on Kormir or other gods and that some gods aren't as big paragons as she had hoped. Hearing their dialogue about religion and the post-god feelings about worship would be interesting to listen to and find out if they get along or find it uncomfortable being around one another.
---
Beyond that, though, who knows. Zafirah might play a role in a Menzies storyline, depending on if Menzies, Balthy's evil half-brother, appears in living world or a raid, or if he's to appear in any way at all and his planned plot for PoF/S4 which Peter Fries alluded to simply wasn't scrapped entirely in the rewrites (Devona's scrolls seem to suggest the Eternal Battle between Eternals and Shadow Army ended in the former's victory off screen which might explain Balthy's desire to battle the dragons instead of finishing off Menzies). Personally I'd be surprised if Menzies appears anywhere else than raid as he's arguably as obscure a lore character as Desmina was, but his plot potential is huge, especially if he became a shadowy villain plotting in the background while another villain acts as a front for Menzies's desire for domination, chaos, deception and destruction. To my knowledge no one in Tyria even knows what Menzies, the Lord of Destruction, looks like, so he could appear as a seemingly benevolent ghost at first to trick us into doing his bidding before revealing his true colors similar to Pride demon's scheme in Dragon Age Origins (which arguably was the strategy Balthazar used in Season 3 except appearing as a historically treacherous mursaat). Then again, devs could pull the rug from under us and reveal Menzies as an antihero who has been historically misunderstood while Balthy was always the actually evil sibling all along although that reveal would require mental gymnastics to explain why Menzies would court with demons and nightmares and align with notably evil gods like Abaddon and Dhuum in an unholy trinity of an alliance.
---
However Zafirah's plot moves forward, I'm grateful for her inclusion and the religious commentary she delivers which helps flesh out the Balthazar POV better than the childish High Priest of Balthazar from Central Tyria ever did. I only hope that Kito won't be forgotten as we move onward as I'm really curious what kind of story the devs originally had for him given his name meaning gem/precious stone as well as the Order of Shadows' treachery regarding the murder of a Whispers agent which sadly hasn't been explored since.
---
You'd have a point if it wasn't completely effortless to use the Large Potions. Not to mention, the "elite top 1%" typically gets the infinite versions during the process of becoming elite top 1%.
---
In fact, when a good player passes up on the Large Offensive Potion, it's *more* damage and kill speed left on the table because 15% of 35,000 DPS is more than 15% of 10,000 DPS.
---
I loved this so much, and for what it's worth I like the artwork. I have two very expressive cats and you'd be surprised at how much their faces can change (perhaps ot to the extreme shown in the art, but still). 
---
Rytlock has always been a bit of a flat character (imo), but since his mess with the sword he's become more interesting. Now to find out about his past makes me super excited. In GW1 we helped in the Charr revolution, perhaps in GW2 we'll see Rytlock create his own branch of Charr, something between the Olmakhan and the legions.   
---
\#Rytlocksrunts

Wont happen in a long while and even if it does it wont change anything that is not happening now already. We still have servers but now called worlds, we still can not make the world alliance only, people without a guild or who have not stated if they are a wvw guild or not will be placed on worlds outside of alliances which is the same now were bandwagoners join a server and it is ok for a month or two and then the hordes of wannabe bandwagoners join and in the end they are not what bandwagoners want and they move server and it start over again. I see nothing different happening more then servers are now worlds and the first round might be great then we know how to abuse or use it it and the moving starts over at every world wipe just as it is now at every link swap.
---
I LOVE your style :D
---
As a Chronomain most definitely Continuum Split.. Boi it feels good to cast Skills twice o/
---
Didn't know about fractals having proofs thanks for the info!
---
When you left the golem on at home
---
What elite players are not using pots? They automatically apply every time you take the mistlock. I never even bother applying them cos they're always there.
---
If they don't have the omnipotion they're not really the top 1%.
---
Power Chrono is totally a solid choice for a DPS spot in fractals but you may have to write 5 times in caps in every group that you are a DPS and not a support :p
---
the result is still effectively the same, legal action can be taken against them. you're just being pedantic
---
i was comparing creating one ascended gear :) and if you are running fractals which i suppose you are when going for ascended gear then other currency is no issue really :) and is cheaper because you dont need exotic insignia and Damask Patches which are the main problem of crafting the old way :)
---
Yup totally. 
---
"Quick"
---
Thank you. You just gave me a lot of assurance on playing power chrono and took away a lot of stress trying to gear a boon Chrono!!

---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/67307/shrine-guardian-outfit-head-piece-suggestion-to-become-armour-skin
---
I have a post in the forums that needs the attention of the devs. The more we post and vote the more chance we have of it possibly becoming a skin. And I really do want this pushed. 
---
It has nothing to do with the whiskers. It's his eyes and his nose. [They look like they were copied directly from a Skritt.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Hua%27racche.jpg)
---
Just play classes that are in high demand. My group often end up 4 manning 100CM while waiting for a warrior.
---
Sometimes they'll offer the difference in gems if your purchase was close enough to the sale price. You'd have to open a ticket to try.
---
I still doubt pips/rewards are the problem. Most people with few thousands of ranks and lege armor rather do not give crap about wvw rewards anymore.
---
First, it's ~10g, 600 inscribed shards and 1250 volatile magic, which would put the price closer to the icebrood backpack.
---
Once-per-account recipes aren't exactly common, you have to explicitely buy the recipe on top of the materials, and apart from the "You have already crafted this item" message below the materials list I haven't seen any warning regarding this.
---
So at least I can tell that I would have definitely tried to craft a second one at some point if I didn't see this thread. :)
---
Most ascended trinkets are indeed not rare, but ascended backpacks with PoF-stats? Aside the limited number from the story achievements there are... legendaries and raids.
---
At least I could not name another source right now.
---
Which is a bit weird considering most PoF combinations are not even that special.
---
As for the practical need: in theory you could just take the backpacks you get, select every PoF combination and move them around between your characters. 
---
The main advantage of not doing that I could think of would be that you save the hassle of constantly moving sets around, don't have to compromise with the look of your backpack or waste tons of transmutation charges, and maybe use different infusions per character.
---
So yeah, I don't really get the point of being so stingy with them outside of raids. After all, it's not that they are excessively expensive or something, they seem to be just not available.
---
 
---
Nice guide :) and yeah, I didn't know the "new" changes, since I didn't do any for quite a while, but I am just gearing up a new one and maybe I'll go for this one tonight!
---

Reddit cliché noticed: This
---
 Phrase noticed: 3128 times.
---
&gt;we are not that type of achievement hunters
---
Well, the problem is that some achievements replace quests or actually lead you to some fun one-time content. My brother for example never visited Joko's harem before Halloween collection led him there. Of course there are some grindy ones which aren't fun, but I really recommend looking over available achievements - maybe you'll discover something new or fun.
---
you will still amass a respectable amount of gold when the chest drops are empty, but your money per hour will go down a lot since the chests (And volatile magic drops) were the main source of money.
---
They have been there over 250 Years Ago in Guild Wars Prophecies, so it's not that unlikely to find remains of them and/or due to them spooking around in the Maguma "Jungle/Wastes" for over 250 Years
---
Just a quick question, can the Shining Blade be crafted twice? I'm working on the twice-told legend achieve and am considering doing it twice. Yes, I know it's expensive.
---
Maybe they just meant in general. You know, sans outfit. ;)
---
Oh honey. You're deluding yourself if you think that's gay fashion.

Regarding the Lunar New Year achievements:  It doesn't look like I'm able to complete the **Annual Customs** achievement for 50 AP, despite having already completed 6 achievements in the **(Annual) Lunar New Year Customs**.  :(  \[Screenshot here.\]([https://i.imgur.com/7u0NTkh.png](https://i.imgur.com/7u0NTkh.png)).  Have I done something wrong or misunderstood the achievements?  When I click on Annual Customs it says *0/1 Infinite.*

I wanted to give GW2 another try but they can go fuck themselves

All or Nothing isn't the 4th episode though.
---
I'd be surprised if they aren't setting up a potentially bitter family reunion in the future, especially if Rytlock's son is wholly dedicated to Bangar's cause and if Bangar decides to realize his ambitions at long last. Would be just as interesting to run into Crecia and the rest of the Stone Warband who apparently are officers in the legion. :)
---
While I've often been thinking of a tragic Romeo &amp; Juliet story between Ash's Snarl and Blood's Galina if Galina remained loyal to Bangar in a potential civil war, it'd be impactful to witness a similar story between Rytlock and Crecia, or his son, too, showing us the ultimate futility of war where the cost is great regardless of who wins in the end.

I don’t know, maybe it was a self challenge to play without pots? It a fact that they played extremely well without them. I remembered it well because I was gonna speak up but chose to shut up instead, which I’m glad I did.

Who are these guys exactly? I dont see the intention of this Post tbh... 
---
Thanks for reply. I will try it as soon as im home.

Ty for help. :)
---
same here - uptove for long and good comment and for telling something i wasnt aware of

Thank you!

As I’ve mentioned in another similar comment, perhaps they were doing a self challenge of playing without pots? I remembered it well because it was at a time when I was tired of pot-less pugs kept dying. 
---
Anyway I was gonna speak up for potion check as usual, but didn’t. The elite player was top dps despite not using pots. Glad I didn’t speak up, because I would’ve looked like a fool.

But Cantha isnt in gw2 yet. You can't just rip stuff from a region thats not even in the game yet and sell it for 10€.

How is that ok?

Both of those should have been armor sets.

Does specific gear such as Heavy Houndskin Mantle unlock the skin for all 3 armor types, or only the specific one?

Pepperidge Farm remembers!

What are collections and how do they work?  I got some exotic spoon from a world boss and am told it's part of a collection.  I was also told to visit an NPC in Lions Arch to start a collection.  I talked to the NPC and I think it took money but I didn't get anything in my inventory.  And I still have this spoon.  Is it safe to just vendor it?
---
Staff heal tempest easily heals the most of any class, but you don't share much might or fury. The whole of staff water is straight healing abilities with reasonable ratios. 
---
Warhorn tempest shares a ton of might, but neither primary weapons you can use have relevant heal abilities in water. Druid out-heals warnhorn tempest has has better range on most abilities. 
---
You unlock the skin for the 3 armor types in your wardrobe but you only get an actual item with the skin already on it in your inventory for 1 type.
---
Gotcha, thank you!
---
TFW you have to google the extension because you're a normal player.

Honestly, I was nervous about starting them at first too but one day I decided to jump in on the 1-25 lfg.  A lot of them you can kind of work out the mechanics just running through even if you're in a silent group. I found that in these levels if the team is struggling, people who know the mechanics will usually jump into the chat long enough to comment what needs to be done and so far no one has been an asshole about it.
---
Most of the early fractals (Volcanic, Cliffside, Urban Battleground, Uncategorized) are thankfully good ones to start out with.  Solid Ocean has pretty simple mechanics too, but does require you to have at least some Agony Resistance slotted.
---
He means the skin, he wants the skin to be available on multiple characters at once.

Common bug with certain models. They usually fix the enemy models fast but many can recall being completely blind as dozens of these effects stack on a boss.

Also, try out the jackalope tonic and equip a bundle item (I.e. teleportation gun or spiky fruit). The bundle will be huge.

This is why I have beat W1 10 times and nothing else.

I was thinking about ascended insignia with core stat, but forgot that diviner stuff requires serpentine jewels.

Don't speak to me or my daughters ever again.

Rite of the Great Dwarf is an elite skill, not on the same level as an aura. Kalla's Fervor might be more in line with an aura?

Ow. Man I am glad I havn't started Qadim CM yet... Hopefully I will get my Dhuum CM kill soon. Gl to you too.

Everything about this is a monumental fuck up. I didn't think this could get worse but it just kept going. So not only was their cheat detection so vague it must have been completely useless (I would be shocked to learn now that the *majority* of the bans weren't false positives), but they go and fuck up GDPR while they're at it by telling people they're not storing the data about them... which this post clearly proves not to be the case.
---
Half of my character is black, the other is white, split down the middle in cutscenes. I think it's awesome looking, the markings are normal too.
---
how do you make gold from this? the reward is crap copper basically nothing for 1,000 &amp; 5 ap and you can only repeat 5 times to 25ap max? 
---
I guess maybe if you do it more but i'd rather use the luck to make backpacks and sell for about 4+g profit per 250 essences.

I think he got sniper in his name somewhere, but he also usually spawns directly at the entrance of the fight area, so he is easy to spot.

Big facts.

Derp scorpion too

---
I don't really think we need to introduce another character to our band, especially Zafirah. We had killed the most important person to her and she joined us. WTF? Devs felt like it's important to humanize Balthazar followers a bit but I don't like the way they did it. 
---
I also support the just jump in and learn at first. If you want cheap gear, check the trading post for named exotic armor. Individual pieces can be found for &gt;1 gold each these days. Search for Zhed's, Norgu's, or Ogden's armor on the trading post. This will give you a big boost while you learn and move on to more 'meta' builds and gear
---
Have you played BnS or Aion? 
---
I'm torn on it for multiple reasons, but namely what you're saying here. I just don't know.
---
Griffon is the jack of all trades that can fly. It can jump high not quite as high as the bunny. Its not as fast as pure ground mounts but it hops. Then anytime you can get a dive in its unstoppable and fun as shit to use.  Pretty much my go to unless the situation needs something else.
---
Ooh you mean the fireflies? Yeah they're native to the jungle and you'll see them all over. If you actually stop to look around you at night (assuming you're safe, of course!) You'll find they're actually quite pleasant to look at!

They're tiny though so I can see why you'd make this post

I think they were recently on the gem store

Armor should be the last thing you go for anyway. The gain you get for weapons is way greater and trinkets are easy to get.

You misunderstand, I am not saying the game should keep me entertained 100% of the time. That would be an unreasonable thing to expect, however, like I said in my post ArenaNet could do better. 
---
I am somewhat in a unique position in that I have had fairly good access to devs. When it comes to things like balance, to content creation, ArenaNet is just... Slow. They also don't really listen.
---
I don't think its fair to criticise the opinion that ArenaNet should do more either. Like you said, everyone wants something different. I am completely aware of the fact that the game is casual focused. Nor do I flame ArenaNet for taking that business approach. That said though, I wouldn't flame someone saying they want more open world events - it doesn't particularly interest me, but they're welcome to that opinion.
---
Everyone should always be seeking their own self interest when it comes to games. We shouldn't be whiteknighting games companies because honestly that does nothing for them, or for us. At the end of the day ArenaNet will do what is best for them, but I will sure as hell criticise them when its not what is best for me.
---
The outfit system is stupid tbh, I’m not sure why they don’t allow us to use pieces with other pieces, they would make so much more money too 
---
Yeah the rng chests from fractals or raids are best kept around in the bank untill you want to gear a new charater. Would not rely on them.
---
I think it's better to compare weak elements of the game you play with other games that pull them off in a good  way. Strive for greatness and all that jazz. 
---
it sure beats the terrible timegating that ArenaNet loves to put into the living world releases
---
I’m doing the desert mastery right now and I’m kinda mixed on it. I have a tag so the elergy mosaics only took 2 weeks. 
---
I’m currently at 128/250 incenses. I only do 5 hearts per day and I also exchange elergy mosaics, an ecto, and obsidian shard for incenses at the primeval steward in the Tomb. So I’m at 10 incenses per day. 
---
I hate HoT with a passion so for me, this is fine but it’s not great. 
---
If you're after exotics, map-complete any of the lvl70-80 core maps. They give exotics, but these are generally not that good. Completing dungeons gives you specific dungeon tokens.
---
You can trade those in for maxlvl exotic armor. Both flame citadel and Arah dungeon tokens you can trade in for berserker stats armor and weapons, which will be your go get stat-combination for deadeye, because it increases your general dmg through 'power' and your crit dmg and chance through 'ferocity' and (dunno the English term). 
---
World bosses in general are actually more of a event and woah moments for me when fighting them. And it can be fun to zerg down some low lvl world bosses or to rly coordinate with a huge group of people (tequatl for example will require at least some coordination). they WILL give you rare gear which can be salvaged into ectoplasm (important ingredient for a ton of various recipes), so there's that. 
---
Fractals will be important for you when you got your character geared up... first with exotic equipment than with ascended (which will drop in high lvl fractals, raids or can be crafted)... yea. 
---
I suggest you first keep completing maps, if you're rly into that. You actually need to do that if you want to craft gen1 legendary weapons as well.
---
Well welcome, and have fun :)
---
With all the "galaxy" skinned mounts and effin infusions - GW has turned into the biggest eyecancer MMO on the market. Sad - but true
---
understandable, have you tried to do the bloodstone infused ectoplasm collection, without guide it's an interesting scavenger hunt ;)
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bloodstone-Infused\_Ectoplasm](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bloodstone-Infused_Ectoplasm)
---
It would almost certainly also cost them so much more money too. 
---
How? It would just be the same progress as making outfit skins, probabaly won’t be that bad
---
Actually, I believe that their operations have not been good so far. Remember that the whole idea of identifying cheaters by checking whether a running process has the same hash as a blacklisted tool is literally a joke. I might be going full Stallman here, but it's my computer and my programs, and as long as I'm not using these programs to cheat I am free to have them running (that's literally what the Holy Bible AKA GW2 ToS says).
---
Given all the data we have, that whole incident is simply unacceptable. ArenaNet developers must have been aware how faulty this "cheat detection" mechanism is and how it does **not** detect whether GW2 client has been tampered with. They must have been aware that md5 hashing can result in collisions. And finally, they must have been aware that this kind of process scanning is a shady and maybe even illegal in some countries.
---
I cannot find the post on forums right now, but I remember that Gaile Gray even told us that people who were banned were not banned just due to the spyware reports, but due to the fact that this nasty piece of software verified their observations. Given these emails people are getting, I believe we have been lied to.
---
They'd also have to worry more about clipping and I guess someone did the math and the result was outfits make enough to not bother with individual armor pieces and all the clipping involved for the amount of money they'd make.
---
Oh btw, here are a few [more examples](https://imgur.com/a/AZxbrgv)
---
yeah but don't use yer blue essences on this, only green and up. Save those blues for backpacks - you make lots more gold (3.5-4+g per 250 blues which is 14-15g per 1,000blues, than a couple silver from this cheeve.
---
It's very bad, that's why outfits exist in the first place
---
Yeah I get what you mean, I mean that’s why I never buy outfits anymore, only bought 2 when I started playing and got refunded for 1 of them because I didn’t know I could use different pieces 
---
Their reasoning when they introduced the outfit system was that they have an easier time building whole outfits than designing pieces for each and every race individually. 
---
So what they are saying they cannot afford the work force or time todo so which makes me question why I am playing if they think like that.  
---
Also tinfoil hat, but I believe outfit system was introduced not just because of the reason above but because they can price it higher than individual pieces. People would sometimes just buy one pieces = less money. They earn money because people have to cash in more by buying one item alone.
---
Not at all. It would take tons of mo eye to develop. Each piece would have to be compared with and modified with every other piece it might touch to avoid clipping and all sorts of other errors. 
---
This might seem like a stupid detail to praise, but the outline on Kralk are the perfect fucking width, like holy moly you are good. It helps divide the picture in two so much more when contrasted to the cliff with no outline.
---
Not in the slightest. Outfits can be made without taking anything else into account. Pieces on the other hand needs to take every single other piece of gear into account. Which is a massive amount of work. 
---
Yeah that does sound about right, some individual pieces go for like 300 or so
---
Hi, which living world season and episode brings the best contribution to PVE? Like ascended trinkets, gold farming, achievements, etc. I don't really care about the story line for now because I got limited cash to buy the episodes. Please advise.
---
I see Outfits as the "easy way out", where you don't want to customize every piece of armor that you wear but you still want to look good.
---
&gt; So what they are saying they cannot afford the work force or time todo so which makes me question why I am playing if they think like that.
---
I mean, they clearly can, since they do release armor sets now and then. But it would take way longer between each new set if they went for pieces instead of full static sets. And then people would whine about them working too slowly. 
---
... It's that the Wild, Wild Pussycats?
---
Go play something else till the next update then. It isn't dead anyway I see quite a few players in every map I go on.
---
Can't get launch buddy to work when this tool is active. Any advice?
---
&gt; Then don't buy it
---
Worked for Battlefield V, didn't it?
---
Usually I don’t give too much thought to how wide the lines should be. I mean it’s rarely a concsious, rational decision at this point. I use a width than sufficient to create the level of detail I want to use and as this is a stylistic choice to have lines visible, make sure that they aren’t too thin so the get lost when looking at the image/animation as a whole. I case of using it only on the dragon, that had a purpose, to give it focus and importance. I hope that answered your questions :)
---
We get the exact same thread.
---
Every.
---
Fucking.
---
Outfit. 
---
We get it. You don't like outfits and you think they're pointless. Other people like them and clearly buy them. How the hell are we still having this conversation almost 5 years later? April 2014. That's when this started. Give it the fuck up already.
---
And in what world are outfits better for us?  
---
Look at all the memes of outfits looking totally out of place on other races than human.
---
Whole gw2 community knows iit and is memeing hard whenever a new outfit is released. Just look at the front page of r/guildwars2  . There is a meme post about a norn with two female humans wearing the shrine guardian outfit just because it looks stupid/funny/out of race.
---
If you compare FFXIV to GW2 for example, the cash shop is very minor and has mostly other FF game characters' costumes and seasonal stuff from past years. It's hardly advertised and honestly all I ever bought in 2 years was a santa costume for like 3 euros. Which actually is my kind of only problem with their cash shop because it once was a free event item years ago, but at least the price range is about 3 euros. Meanwhile majority of the nice looking mounts and skins are drops from bosses or crafted.
---
If you compare it to GW2, it's not even close. Almost anything half decent looking is a cash item, and due to gems -&gt; gold transaction, your playtime is much much much less valuable than in FF. I do love both games, and I can see the value in f2p model for some people, but if you're going to spend some money on the game anyway I think it's way better to play FFXIV. I know this will be an unpopular opinion in GW2 reddit, but I will give credit where credit is due.
---
Living World Season 3 has a lot of ascended trinkets you can farm quite quickly.
---
A Crack in the Ice will give you Bitterfrost Frontier, which is a constant farm for berries to but ascended backpiece, accessory, ring and aquabreather.
---
Flashpoint will give you Draconis Mons, which has an ascended collection back piece as well as an amulet and a ring. 
---
Oh you mean like how they gave a dark-skinned race Egyptian cultural motifs even though Egyptians were never that dark? 
---
People didn't want mounts because they said "thematically" it made zero sense.
---
REMOVING an income? Do you have any idea how many people don't buy outfits simply because they're full sets? You clearly don't.
---
&gt;There is no righteous cause here, no dignified voicing of concerns in a public forum. You're all just shouting into the wind, repeatedly, endlessly, without regard to the fact that some people like a nice breeze and would prefer it a lot more if people weren't constantly shouting whenever one picked up.
---
And what the hell are you even talking about here?
---
If you don't like people "complaining" about something in the game then just leave this sub. People have every right to want separate pieces. 
---
Your attitude is ridiculous.
---
they are on the 2nd page. probably because there isnt much action in them right now?
---
Every one I can think of has in-game shops. WoW has pets/mounts/levelpots, which isn't too bad. RS3 has a ton of cosmetics and pets and lootboxes. FFXIV has an overwhelming amount of cosmetics, convenience, levelpots/QUESTPOTS.
---
Tbh I don't think there's many arguments for sub based games having the better model nowadays. FFXIV was legit like "Yeah story sucks at the beginning and you're forced to do it if you want to play anything relevant, but we're not gonna fix it or give alternatives because we can charge new players to skip it." That's no more healthy than any money grubbing f2p/b2p model.
---
I don't have personal experience with WoW, I admit that, at the moment I only play GW2 and FFXIV. WoW is going downhill pretty fast so it's not really a good game to compare to anymore sadly... I wonder if "the king of MMOs" is finally dethroned soon...
---
That's not how Reddit works. They were on HOT's page until more recent HOT stuff appeared.
---
This, the clipping excuse is just female human meta players that don't get that clipping has been and always will be prevalent for all non-female humans in this title.
---
I'm also not sure why the dark-skinned Elonians have such prominent Egyptian motifs and architecture, when actual Egyptians were much lighter in complexion historically. But hey, if mish-mashing races and cultures is good enough for Arenanet, why cant fan artists do it too?
---
Yup! Since HoT was released AFAIK
---
It’s not censorship, it’s how Reddit works.  The more commenting/voting that happens, the longer it stays on the front page.  Once it starts to die down, the post drops.
---
&gt; my five jobless friends
---
:D
---
I'm really confused about reddit link post system, not sure how to make the image preview available . Sorry about this format!
---
So much this. My friend is so into FFXIV. The starter areas may be shit because its old and outdated, oh my jesus the content they bring is so good.
---
And for all the people here. You know FFXIV was on the edge of going into Free-To-Play. You know what they did?
---
The CEO made a survey and questioned the playerbase via social medie (I don't know exactly how it went. My friend told me.) and asked the community if they should keep the supscribtion model. It was not even close. The playerbase decided to keep the subscription model because they knew going free to play means less and fewer quality content.
---
**They were transparent about their road of finding a solution**.
---
You can't say that about ArenaNet. They don't speak to us much. Just on occasion. They always say (paraphrased) "there is nothing to discuss until next milestone. See you in like half a year."
---
We are talking about a game that is still one of the more popular MMOs around. And it have been around for over 6 years. The vast majority of that time with the "shortterm model" that you talk about. And despite that it is still one of the most long lived MMOs alive and there is still no signs of it shutting down anytime soon. 
---
I have been here since head-start (and before that I played GW1 since release). I very much remember season 1. The fact that you claim that we had "so many great updates back then" does very much suggest you did NOT take part of it. The vast majority of the updates during season 1 were minisculed compared to season 3/4. 
---
Fact still remains that they have tried both ways (pieces and full static outfits) and they have kept going with the outfits. That does suggest that outfits does indeed generate the best income vs cost for them, otherwise they would have changed it a long time ago. 
---
I hope they release the ears separately like they did with the shoulders on Braham’s outfit. I would definitely buy the ears as an armor piece.
---
I need to buy outfits because its the only way to wear Leather Armor on my Warrior.
---
Medium Classes complain about Trench Coats... i wish my warrior could wear one.
---
Just cause it's not up in everyone's face, doesn't mean it's being censored. 
---
&gt; Do you have a fave dungeon or sughestion of the next area to clear?
---
For map completion and dungeons, I wait until they come up in the dailies. If there are events in a zone, I'll normally finish it off for map completion. 
---
what I said boils down to it cost them nothing for this half ass apology that they made after being caught trying to sweep things under the rug, and OP had to go through teeth pulling effort to even discover their incompetence.
---
and your reply is, you expect them to actually have to spend money and take some sort of responsibility!? how entitled you are!?
---
can't tell if you are just trolling or really can't see the difference.
---
Overwhelming? Hardly. FFXIV has a lot but it's mostly old content and stuff they gave out at various fan fests and shows. Quest Pots/Level Pots are pretty much the same thing as the GW2 Level 80 boost so that's not really a fair comparison.
---
Besides FFXIV does something GW2 doesn't and that's put the majority of its cosmetics and mount skins into the actual game to earn by playing the game.
---
Also lock 10 player for raid squad, else it wont work
---
thanks a lot!!
---
&gt;Also tinfoil hat, but I believe outfit system was introduced not just because of the reason above but because they can price it higher than individual pieces. People would sometimes just buy one piece they really like = less money.
---
Lol so wrong dude.  You assume that the buying habits now would be the same if they had a new system.  If every person who has bought an outfit instead just bought one armor piece they would lose money, but that's not realistically what would happen.   There is a huge market of players who would gladly spend 300 for just a single piece that aren't bothing to spend any gems on a whole outfit today.  A system that completely itemized each item and made them all individually purchasable isn't going to *cost* them profit, it's going to make them money.
---
What?
---
They give a higher percentage of mastery xp than they do for leveling a character to 80, gives an under leveled character about 1/3 of a level. My husband got 3 or 4 mastery tiers just doing the griffon adventures in the PoF maps in 2 days
---
Oh well, I suppose this is a nice idea but I don't think that -
---
__SNEK__ NEED SNEK
---
I can't wait to see the next upcoming mount. Mike Z said we will get another mount. He said it in September 11, 2018. 
---
(it's not the beetle mount, that was in June 26, 2018). 
---
many parts of the game have this problem, lack of reward in general
---
It will happen sometime between "Soon™" and "Later©".
---
I was under the impression that Diviner in the LWS3 trinkets wad an error. Diviner was introduced in HoT for PvP, and when Thunderheaf was first released, LWS3 trinkets could select it and most other stat-sleect gear couldn't, so I assumed a flag was set wrong and it was mislabeled HoT. Is that selection on HoT stuff intentional?
---
At the point of the post, I do think it's weirdly difficult to get PoF trinket stats. Since I do Fractals a lot, I had a thousand-ish spare pristine relics I cashed in for Mists gear, with the PoF story achievement rewards filling in some of the Harrier gear. I don't even bother with back items. I screwed up and doubled up on Harrier backs; it's not worth replaying the story repeatedly or doing one of the back collections for the tiny stats that backs actually give. I basically haven't gone back to any LWS4 map because raiding or running Fractals are just better for gearing up with these stats.
---
As another note, if the next LW releases with a new stat combo and no back item, then every non-raid, non-Legendary backpack from PoF will be *required* to have each stat type in PoF at Ascensed rarity. That's a serious problem, IMO. 
---
This clipping excuse is nonsense. There are plenty of armor pieces, even recently released ones from PoF, that have clipping issues; particularly on anything that isn't a human female and especially on charr. What are these "other errors" you speak of?
---
Make it longer! Looks like awesome login screen tbh! :D
---
&gt; I'm 100% confident in a company's ability to discern, after 5 years of data, the ratio of two similar products to offer to maximize income.
---
Lol you live in an imaginary world kid.
---
&gt;I'm 100% confident that you don't have the data to begin to argue otherwise, regardless of how many people you think would buy armor pieces.
---
You're not presenting data yourself.
---
&gt;And I'm complaining that y'all are the definition of insanity. It's been the exact same thread for 5 years, nothing will ever change, give it up. If you don't like me mocking you for doing something repetitive and pointless, you are free to leave the sub.
---
You're telling people to shut the fuck up and accept things as they are. This is completely ridiculous. I'm shocked that people like you still exist in 2019.
---
Imagine how this game would be today if no one complained about anything at all.
---
You are ridiculous. Your attitude is ridiculous. You need to grow up and catch up with the times old man.
---
Digimon!
---
&gt; sorry for my poor english
---
I forgive you, go on.
---
&gt; will last another 6 years
---
Does it matter, if yes - why?
---
&gt; its time to move on for arenanet
---
No, its time for you (6 guys) to move on. Having that much ambition, requirements, and ungodly amount of time you (6 guys) spend on game that has no enough content, you (6 guys) could start a game.dev company 7 years ago... and have stuff you listed inc. 20ppl raids by now.
---
&gt; And for the new players
---
So, it is not dead, which was not your initial opinion.
---
YEEES! I really want a dragon mount. I would never leave gw2 if they make one D:

Didn't they tried with [Braham's Wolfblood Pauldrons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Braham%27s_Wolfblood_Pauldrons) which is a shoulder part of [Braham's Wolfblood Outfit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Braham%27s_Wolfblood_Outfit)?
---
I guess it wasn't profitable so they didn't bother experimenting further.
---
Looks like he belongs to a BOOK CLUB.

Looks like he belongs to a book club.

&gt; REMOVING an income? Do you have any idea how many people don't buy outfits simply because they're full sets? You clearly don't.
---
If outfits were not popular across the whole GW2 population and Anet wasn't making good enough money compared to the time spent on them they would have stopped a long time ago. Enough people buy them so that it's still interesting for Anet to keep making them. And this has nothing to do with me or you being for/against outfit vs armor piece skins.
---
No, it's chinese. Because it's chinese new year.
---
No, it doesn't have to mean that. 
---
I think the armor system as a whole needs some reworks, but sadly we won't be seeing those anytime soon
---
Haha, would be interesting for sure. Give us a kangaroo instead! 
---
but... you the one who started complaining about other people complaining lmao
---
Tbh, I can get the whiskers. It looks like charr do have them, judging by the marks on their faces. I just don't think they wanted to try and render small, wire thin textures that would clip through the 5 helmets that actually look good on charr.
---
I can get where you were coming from though. Having never really seen them before, it's hard to imagine them actually being a thing, despite their whiskers being mentioned in dialogue somewhere, (correct me if I'm wrong. ) 
---
Honestly though, this artwork basically looks like they told the guy to draw Rytlock, but with the crying cat meme as his face. 
---
I love Anet, I really do, but this just has me confused on a whole new level. They know what the characters look like, so why did they approve this? Were they afraid to correct them or what? If you do art in that type of business setting, you'll get roasted by your boss. 
---
I want it on my Charr because it's more reminiscent of a Maine Coon cat's ears, and I modeled my Charr after my pet Maine Coon. But keep trying to be insulting.
---
If you WANT to look different, don't buy and use an outfit, period. It defeats your entire aim, even if you like how it looks. Outfits are fine, they are what they are, and we have TONS of armor pieces to mix/match already, with more being given to us over time. Is it really worth ranting about something when you can just.. I don't know.. not use them and look unique with your own flair and style?
---
Advice launch buddy creator as i don't know what it does and how it does.
---
Personally I and one tester have tryed it, with zero results. 
---
&gt; If outfits were not popular across the whole GW2 population and Anet wasn't making good enough money compared to the time spent on them they would have stopped a long time ago.
---
How the hell do you know that? 
---
They never actually tried separate pieces in a whole set. We have two, maybe three sets total. The rest is one piece. 
---
Stop pulling things out of your ass.
---
Extra sub for more bank space, pay to skip bad quests, etc. There are currently 426 items available for sale in the Mogstation, that's not including the extra sub for extra retainers, nor the items that rotate out.
---
I'm not arguing for GW2, I'm just saying FFXIV is not in a better position at all. Being a sub MMO doesn't really do much positive for the players, they still stick an insane amount of stuff in cash shop. A small limited time way to earn some of them in game is fine and all, but god forbid you don't log in during the two weeks an event is up, you'll be paying $40 to get all of the items, god forbid you want multiples for housing. It just feels kind of cheap for a subMMO, especially since the events are very shallow and repetitive outside of the "new story." 
---
Reddit forces content off of the front page after a certain amount of time or when engagement drops. If it had been censored, you would not be able to read the content of the original post or be unable to find it.
---
The moderation logs show nothing, so it's just Reddit doing its thing.
---
I propose there is also a new novelty mount: War Quaggan!
---
It's just a regular quaggan tied to a rudimentary chariot that is slower than a normal walk and also very easily distracted. But it'd be so gorram cute!
---
This is a bit of an unfocused text brick, so sorry about that.
---
Buffing the Aura part of Auramancer is something I really think would help the class, but some of these ideas are really not good. Auras are applied by sources other than Tempest, so changing them in general affects other classes, especially Light and chaos auras. Toughness on Magnetic Aura can mess up aggro on Raid bosses. Removing Powerful Auras from Water makes non-Tempest Aura sharing impossible on Elementalist. Harmonious Conduit being a group damage buff is both too strong since DPS Tempest could just slot it for a big team damage amp and shouldn't be tied to field duration since the fields aren't the same. 
---
While logically this makes sense (and I very much wish they did it this way) all the data shows that higher priced "big items" generate more revenue than trying to sell a higher volume of cheaper items. The "huge market of players who would gladly spend 300" just isnt there when its time to bust out the credit card. 
---
&gt; They took responsibility, that's what an apology is
---
if that's your definition of taking responsibility after doing every thing in their power to not get caught then I have nothing else to say.
---
I guess he didnt level but boosted
---
I'd sooner buy 2~3 armor pieces worth 300~400 gems each (heck, I tend to) than to buy a single, fixed outfit for 700 gems ever. I doubt I'm really alone in that. Options are what sells me on things.
---
Allow what part exactly? 
---
cool song
---
i dont know anything about this game yet but that looked cool too
---
Sadly it is a very toxic mentality that people on this subreddit in particular have. People just aren’t interested in reasoned arguments, instead favouring comments that agree with their own views in the game. 
---
It doesn’t frustrate me really, I don’t need reddit karma to justify my own views, but it is a shame that those who do downvote don’t leave a comment saying why, even if it is just to say “I think you’re wrong”.
---
Implying that skins released now don't clip. ANet doesn't care about clipping, they just want more money for the least amount of work possible.
---
I agree that MMO development is a whole different beast compared to single player games but my point was specifically towards the notion that it should go subscription based. It simply won't work because of two reasons: 
---
1)  Sub based games have a portion of different audience than the B2P ones especially the ones who specifically don't want to or afford x bucks a month but they do want to enjoy the game. 
---
2) Anet's original philosophy (which I mentioned in previous post) which will betray the players and cause them to instantly lose them and find a different game. 
---
They forced WvW players to play PvE for years to get stuff they needed.
---
It is allowed, but only if you handle each instance with separate calls. Also, lauchbuddy got hit hard by the removal of auto-login
---
Excuse me, what did you call me?
---
Please do try to explain how a lapse in automated bot detection (and subsequent lapses in customer service ticket handlers) points to a failure in long term income stream management.

"ANET BAAAAAAAD" isn't an argument, it's a fallacy.

literal nobody that we dont care about because he's been in like 2 episodes
---
Thanks that people that whined and cried "P2W in fashion wars :v" when they tried to put armor sets in the gemstore.
---
Now we gotta stick with those goddamn outfits...what's also more sad is that probably a lot of those whiners do not even play the game anymore. 
---
I agree with that yeah! They could vary the flavor of the functions to make them feel different, but even without that I think the biggest draw for it would really be being able to choose one mount skeleton over another. 
---
That's exactly what I thought.
---
people have always been doing HoT metas multiple times a day, what are you talking about? 
---
I know the design philosophy, I and like I already mentioned I know GW2 can't go sub based. It's just the sad reality that we have to watch the game slowly focus more and more on making profits off of cash items and turn more predatory as the game turns older.
---
It just means in the end the people who pay for the game will be frustrated eventually and moving on, and that's where you will see their philosophy start failing. A f2p with micro transactions will only work as long as the playerbase feels it's fair, like in League of Legends I guess just looking at their success. I think that the best bet for a f2p game would be to remove the paywall to get into the game entirely, like expansion costs in GW2.
---
no, you're not the only one. 
---
Seems counter-intuitive to me. People who buy outfits (in their current state) will wear them and see no point in going to earn the achievement ones, since they can't wear them together.
---
Whereas if they change them into separate pieces, it gives an incentive for players to buy, then earn other ones through the game to compete their custom look (Sorry if the source discusses this, I can't view it on mobile).
---
Outfits are designed anyway in pieces. You can't make something in a whole piece. I think it's mainly due to anchor points on the character model and so on...
---
That said the choice of outfits in the past was also because a lot of people whine when they put the armor skins in the gemstore. Calling it P2W in GW2...at begin everyone took outfits well, but now people is simply tired of them.
---
Another reason can be a sligthly bit less work with clipping between armors etc, but...well...honestly it's all quite bullshit imo. Not every single armor piece can match with another, deal with the clipping or use something else...bothering the devs over such minor staff is pointless. God know how many pieces of armor i have discarded while trying out outfits for my characters.
---
Alright thanks :D
---
It makes female humans a self-fulfilling prophecy as well. I wanted to play a charr but most of the armor just looks terrible on them. 
---
You could make it so that it takes 100 hours to gain a level,  it doesn't mean there's more content.
---
[I made this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Hansmith). These mounts could be heavily based on creatures which already exist in game. Some have just different skins while other ones have completely different skeleton model (gorilla which could use it's forearms for jump and be a replacement for current model of Springer).
---
I really wish Raptor could get [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/d/d4/Mordrem_Guard_Mount.jpg). I am pretty sure that this mount was like a predecessor for current Raptor.
---
Hi,
---
Thanks for your earlier reply. I managed to fix the issue, and the "P7 init error" message as well.
---
Not sure what solved the issue but I uninstalled GW2 which was in the Program Files (x86) folder and reinstalled it, this time in the Program Files folder.
---
Now, not only can I use your tool in conjunction with Launch Buddy, I no longer get the annoying error pop up when booting up the launcher :D
---
&gt;  I already mentioned I know GW2 can't go sub based.
---
Then why mention it in first place? 
---
&gt; It just means in the end the people who pay for the game will be frustrated eventually and moving on, and that's where you will see their philosophy start failing
---
Why are you assuming stuffs if it had worked so far? You could be right or wrong, I don't know. I mean the same thing can happen to sub based games like it is affecting arguably the biggest MMO right now and ESO was forced to go from mandatory sub to optional sub when they launched As long as the cash shop isn't predatory and I can stay competitive in PvP/WvW it's fine to me. 
---
&gt; A f2p with micro transactions will only work as long as the playerbase feels it's fair, like in League of Legends I guess just looking at their success.
---
LoL is a MOBA and not an MMORPG. The cost to maintain is way lower and it is the largest game out there in terms of playerbase while being backed by the largest publisher (Tencent). Also why should expansions go for B2P to F2P? Doesn't sub based game also charge for expansions? 
---
It's rough but doable. Human female is one of the few race/gender combos I don't have.
---
The ghosts are a part of the current episode's story, they will be explained as you progress the story. They confused the hell out of me the first time they appeared!
---
If u complete world completion and get gift of exploration .
---
Contact me ill buy them for 400g per gift.
---
The big difference between GW2 support and WoW/FF14 healers is, that it doesn't matter what kind of healer class you get for your raiding. While in GW2, everyone screams for Druids because they have so much utility, and other options are mostly ignored by the wider community.
---
The healer classes in FF14 are also way more streamlined. It doesn't matter if you get an Whitemage, Astro or Scholar because their base healing abilities all work the same. You have your different levels of single target and AoE heals. And they have mostly the same healing potency as well. (Scholar is a bit weaker on direct heals but only because they have a healing bot at their side) And the difference between these classes are only secondary. You have Whitemage with a lot of heal over time, Scholar with shields and Astros who can switch between a shield or hot stance. They still have a unique class mechanic and buffs that are only accessible to one class, but they have almost never really matchmaking effects. To say Astro is the best healer just because the Tarot class feature can buff the group damage, or Scholar is the best just because it can do damage while healing, would be just stupid. There is not a single dungeon or raid in FF14 where people are like "Oh no... We have an &lt;insert healer class here&gt; in the group..."
---
And this is not true for GW2. The Chrono utility was not just a nice to have addition to the group, it was so stupidly overpowered that no other class could compete with it. The same for Druid utility. While you still can clear all raids with every support combination that is viable in the game, people don't want to. Because some things are just too good to not have it.
---
Agreed 100% outfits are great for leveling so your gear doesn't look helter skelter while you constantly swap shit out. I would prefer it if we could create custom outfits from armor skins to solve this problem though.
---
Zo-who?
---
I have faint memories of her, almost like those two... Margarine and Token Hot Blonde.
---
yeah they told me if I have a problem with it then simply don't buy the game and let others enjoy it and don't complain. Which was my line of thinking at first too. but when you see more and more games in the market and your favorite franchises fall to the same greedy tactics. I'm left with the only choice of not playing any games at all which I don't think is fair.
---
Prob should have titled the post: Images you can feel: Dhuum CM edition. 
---
might have made it easier to understand. 
---
I care about my robo-bro
---
Here is the thing, the only time eles were meta in PvP was during a **very** short period of D/D Cele. We are not talking about PvE balance in a PvP game mode so lets not bring that up.
---
Every class has had their ups and downs in balance, but Ele has been pretty much non-existent since late days of HoT (more than 2 years ago!) after the heavy global nerfs to sustains overall. When PoF came about, we pretty much became minions.
---
Also, wouldnt you want balance to not be season(y)?! IDK man, I would like for no one to take turns being strong, just a nice middle ground where everyone can play to some extent, but nope, mirage/soulbeasts/holo....cant have that.
---
insane. thanks so much for this.
---
They're not part of our main group though, they're a side character. Same goes for Zafirah right now, but it feels like the story is pushing her into becoming part of our main group while I doubt that the same will be true for Osa
---
I've been saying this from literally launch. Theres some brain block at ANET about this. 
---
Just look at Path of Exile, they make a RIDICULOUS amount of money from MTX because all outfits can be mix and matched 
---
I recently tried guild wars 1 for the first time after a friend convinced me to purchase it during the last steam sale. People are still playing that game and what appeared to be the main hub was packed. I dont think guild wars 2 is in danger of dying anytime soon if guild wars 1 is still kicking.
---
yeah that was my reaction "oh no, the commander is loosing it"
---
Oh I completely agree. It feels like I simply cannot pick up a single player game any longer and expect a complete product at purchase. And that is a shitty feeling
---
Does the vision stone get consumed for each weapon?
---
Reported for sexual harassment
---
Rytlock crying about did me in. Oof.
---
Yeah, still not good, if he keeps going he will burn out quickly and get bored very fast :(
---
Nope
---
this third one is far too fabulous
---
Since Rytlock has cubs this seems less likely to happen :/
---
I still wonder what Rytlock thinks about Logan though
---
One thing I appreciated (even if it came off as heavy handed) was bridging the gap between "Runtlock" to the Rytlock we see in *Edge of Destiny*. I don't recall ever reading how exactly he ever got Sohothin, so that fills in one of the biggest mysteries about the character. 
---
It will definitely be interesting to see Caithe's perspective as she tends to be as mysterious as Rytlock. I assume they're trying to build Zafira (or however you spell it) into a character we should care about because I don't really see any reason for her inclusion in this series. Logan would probably be a better choice, IMO.
---
The simple solution is to offer the outfit in full for gems, but lock the individual parts behind an expensive normal mechanic such as karma, gold, badges, etc.  This way you get people really excited about the set or a particular part of it, and hunting down what they need to do to get it.
---
Yes, but the ascended recipe uses the custom vision item you get instead of a generic Crystal so if you actually make the weapons it's not really a loss
---
What logic is that? Even if she comes back, she's gone now, and they (Tyrians) lost. What they feel is very real and has real repercussions for at least a few months of in-universe time. Why would Anet not want to delve into that? Even if the devs intend to bring Aurene back, from a story perspective, Dragon's Watch would not know that, and so their feelings are valid and interesting regardless of the outcome. 
---
I've gotten it, but it is *very* finicky
---
I'm all for the infusions and crazy particle effects as long as they are tastefully used to create a stylized look. Once people start stacking them, then they just look like idiots with too much money. 
---
300% from luck, ignoring any you get from achievements. In the achievements panel hover over the luck window and it will show you the % from luck, and if that's 300 you shouldn't use luck anymore as it's a waste
---
It sure would be nice to at least have the option. I mean... Let people have their "250li - VG" groups in the current system. And everyone else uses the queue system. Arena Net would not even need to build in multiple difficulty modes. This is the content and you can just drop in and out like you want to. Yes many groups will fail in the beginning and it will be a shitshow at first. But it would also make the content way more accessible without all of the stupid community made-up "proof" systems that you are in fact worthy of being there.
---
More people trying the content results in more people understanding it and, eventually, a bigger raiding community in general.
---
"When do I get to blow him?"
---
Your first paragraph is just...sad you were right to cut it short. I don't want ele to be bad friendo. It's my main alt lol. Engi is my main and since launch ele always felt like another high skill piano dancing class. If every class was on equal terms I'd die happy because this is my favorite game/mode. Unfortunately, that isn't the case though and complaints coming from an ele ring hollow with how strong it's been for years on end. If not meta slightly below at times but very rarely a terrible pick. I don't want revenge(?) Just for ele mains to realize not being the top dog of every mode at all times is a normal thing sometimes. All us other classes have endured those times as well. 
---
&gt; the fact you can get almost nothing that's decent by playing the game other than converting gold to gems annoys me to no end. Only a few armor options, mounts are literally gemstore exclusive
---
Nothing decent is stretching it. There is a bias towards the notion that every outfit looks better any armor earnable in game even when the vast majority of outfits are average at best while completely ignoring the armor skins like the bioluminescent armor set/the requiem set/WvW T3/PVP T3 (recent addition)/cultural (except chart but that's clipping issues mostly). 
---
Also mounts aren't gemstone exclusive, the skins are. They are one of expansion's selling point. 
---
Ignorance is bliss. Some of the happiest people on earth are probably legally retarded.
---
No offense intended.
---
Agree.
---
Two questions!
---
1. Is there an area I can find good builds for Support Chrono and Renegade? I've seen varying builds on Snow Crows that, for example Boon Chrono, run Diviners and Berserkers. I thought these builds ran toughness?
---
2. Can you find the Ectoplasmic Residue in the Envoy 1 Collection in other wings chest's besides Spirit Vale? I have a few articles here that show hidden chests in other wings too. Do these work?
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hidden_chest_(Salvation_Pass)
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hidden_chest_(Stronghold_of_the_Faithful)
---
Thanks!
---
Is there actually data that suggests this? 
---
Anyways, I'll cite BDO as en example of another contemporary mmorpg with a similar focus on skins in their cash shop. While they are an asian MMO their community treats microtransactions but for argument's sake they are similar in the fact that they cater to people who love mmo fashion, and BDO definitely stands out as an MMO that gives users the option to buy just parts of an outfit and use however they want.  It appears that Pearl Abyss generates significantly more revenue than GW2 and of course this is all due to their store.  That's strong evidence that they're doing something right.
---
I found some data on the average annual revenues of both companies (there was more to find on Pearl Abyss but this handy Reddit page for Anet Covered all the years quite nicely.

---
my point is that there is evidence to the contrary of what you say.
---
No for transmutation, but take a look at the available outfits. 
---
To infinity and beyond?
---
The vi that is the only guild that defeated Ash in 2018. Well i believe.
---
The vi that won GvG turney in May defeating Amp, inc and RGB. The one that defeated Lays just after turney.
---
Imo. All outfits and armor skins should get lumped into a 'gem item cosmetic' category that can be mixed and matched, not requiring transmutation charges every time you switch out the pieces.
---
Any non-gem items would still use transmutation charges
---
Every other month, servers who are lesser-populated get paired with a server that is not lesser-populated. It is done based primarily off server population, but there are other factors as well. 
---
Using Crystal Desert as an example: They are currently paired with Maguuma. At present CD is listed as a Medium Population server, so it is not unheard of to expect them to be paired with someone larger in the coming matchup. Maguuma is also listed as a medium population server and will also likely be paired with someone else. Who that is, we will not fully know until reset happens when the pairings change.
---
The best way to figure it out is to check populations. NA currently has 5 FULL servers (TC, SoS, FA, BG, and AR) and 5 VERY HIGH servers (YB, Kaineng, HoD, FC, and DB) and 2 HIGH severs (SBI and NSP). Before even considering the medium population servers, that is 12 servers listed meaning they will all potentially be host servers (since there are only 4 tiers of 3 servers each, it is not hard to believe that).
---
Ferguson's Crossing and Dragonbrand are both non-named servers in their respected pairings, so they may replace CD and GoM as host servers currently. 3-server pairings are not unheard of and happen from time-to-time to compensate for servers who barely make the hosting cut.
---
The new pairings happen on the last Friday of the even numbered month, so we still have a few weeks on the current pairings. That is the current system in place. There is a different "Alliance"-based system coming down the line as well to which there will be significant amounts of information coming out prior to its full implementation (hopefully).
---
I would really like to see a more heavily altered skimmer skin like yours. So far the one premium skin we got feels too similar in design and uninteresting to me. I'm not a big fan of the base skimmer design and would like something more different.
---
heh, I like how your flair is "Village Idiot" lol.
---
Wow, you really had to go there, huh? And yeah, I see that you have the whole "revenge" mentality drilled right to the core. Doesnt matter what anyone have had to "endure", this isnt about endurance or justice. Anyways, I'm not going to do the same thing you did, so I will wish you a good day and hope you reflect on your attitude.
---
Have bought multiple gem armor sets. Magitech, Aetherblade, Phalanx, etc. Have not and will not ever buy a gem store outfit. 
---
Not only that, but also "we need a character impacted by Balthazar's betrayal."
---
Not all players choose humans. Not all humans choose to be blessed by Balthazar. Still, the impact an entire group feels when their patron god turns against them and then dies is worth representing.
---
Kasmeer was shocked and eventually came to terms with the gods not being perfect, but she never quite went through the absolute tragedy that Zafirah did.
---
To not have Zafirah (or an equivalent character) after PoF would be like not having Caithe during HoT. You need representation for the group that's most directly impacted by the revelations in the story, because those perspectives can be invaluable in fleshing things out.
---
Well over [7,000 hours in](https://i.gyazo.com/2a54d67136557f14309a4b076d79e5c4.png) and I still have plenty to do. Sure, I've finished the Personal Story, expansions, and plenty of the LW chapters multiple times, but there's so much I haven't touched yet. 
---
I haven't done the two most recent raids. The only legendary backpiece I have is the PvP one, and so I've been dabbling in Fractals and WvW to get the others. I haven't even touched the Legendary Trinket collection yet, and I have a *ton* of other achievements and collections to grind through. Even if I didn't want to achievement grind like you guys do, there's plenty of rewards behind those achievements that can help with the things you *are* missing out on and wanting - legendary weapons, armor, and accessories open the door to using more stat sets, experimenting with new builds, and trying new content. 
---
Have you done all the T4 Fractals? Have you done the challenge modes on all the raids? Have you participated in PvP tournaments, or joined a group that does WvW regularly? Have you role played? Have you completed ever possible story path? Have you leveled up a guild hall to max rank?
---
If you aren't into that sort of content, then that's totally fine and I can understand getting burnt out, but the game is far from dying. Just because the content isn't your cup of tea doesn't mean there's nothing to do - everyone likes different things, and plenty of people are content to dabble in it all; Many have been playing since day 1 and are still far from done! :) 
---
I mean... he was, that's kind of the point of the short story.
---
I mean, wasn't he?
---
Throw a horse skin onto the Jackal model, and it'll look plain wrong. So no, not "skins"
---
some look really dope, but yeah the individuality thing about it bugs me too. it's the fastest (bc buyable) way to get shiny-shiny looking armour, otherwise you'd need to wait like an eternity till you get the rare armour pieces. while i personally atm do just some colouring and transforming my exotic armor... legendary (i don't know yet if that kind even exists or if ascended is max) is yet far off of my reach.
---
You know the deal with mobile games, right? Also "optional" subscription and other stuffs on their store so all those add up. 
---
One of the problems is that "I want to play for fun" could mean "I'd like to play power reaper without people kicking me for 29k DPS benchmark" or it could mean "I want to autoattack and do fuckall and get carried"
---
You definitely missed out on my favorite zones, any of the snow ones, so I'd suggest exploring them for completion. They're just beautiful and mostly well done. It's a great change of pace from the 'hard' parts of the game if you want to relax and just take in some scenery.
---
I'm willing to buy any outfit if we have full mix-match system. until that, It is really stupid.
---
This was basically a build off of the original Fort Vandal in Brisban Wildlands, which was a massive bandit fortress. In all four forts of Silverwastes as well as Fort Vandal, you can find various objects that hint to the bandit's heavy presence and their ties to the White Mantle. During the first two weeks of Season 2, Riot Alice from the street rat human PS was seen in Prosperity, talking about returning north soon. Sadly, she was never heard of again (but no corpse in vines so presumed living, just joining Zojja and Malyck).
---
These were all set up to remind the players about the group, since the last time they were dealt with were Caudecus's Manor (level 40!) and before that, the human Chapter 2 PS (and not all paths were a clear connection to the bandits either).
---
Fun fact: one of the Silverwastes objects mentioned a "New Kryta" colony that the bandits/White Mantle were establishing in the northern Maguuma. Sadly, that's the only mention of such.
---
I like it, and there is promise! The helm is rendered quite well, and you've stuck to one lightsource so the metal parts look quite good. However the way that the fabric at the sides bulges out, rather than hanging straight makes her look very wide-jawed, but then you've drawn her mouth quite narrow.
---
 I'd say in future in a portrait like this, keep the mouth closed. the contrast and scale of the teeth is distracting and a little strange considering the width of the chin. 
---
Considering the shade that the eye-piece is casting on the top of her cheeks, I'd suggest carrying that through and darkening the underside of the tip of her nose and around her nostrils, as it looks a little flat. 
---
Sorry if you didn't want all this critique though, My only suggestion in the future is find a similar looking model, celebrity or random human posting selfies, and copy their jawline/lower face for proportion- or do studies of skull construction! 
---
I think that's better than looking like a shy anime squirrel :P 
---
Perfect, thank you very much. Will switch all of my armour to diviner's. What about trinkets? Could I keep them berserker? 
---
anyone know if GW2 hook shader and textures work with this mod? I had installed it originally after I had put in GW2 hook and the addon seemed to cancel out the texture and shader packs. However after a clean up of the root file I installed this first, ran the game and then installed the GW2 hook with shaders and textures and the game seems to be working fine. Although the difference is not nearly as noticeable or if it is even actually working in conjunction with GW2 hook. I do love the addon though, when I was running it solo as the only addon in game i saw huge improvements 
---
Thank you!
---
&gt;Since I do Fractals a lot, I had a thousand-ish spare pristine relics I cashed in for Mists gear
---
Part of my point with this issue is that not everyone currently has the ability to farm those relics to buy the trinkets. Same with raiding, or pvp/wvw.
---

Yeah current Swamp is definitely an UGH, and Thurmanova I just usually get carried through ^^ Can't say I'm the biggest cliffside fan though! It speaks volumes for the balance of fractals though that we all have favourites :D
---
What you're looking at are arcdps log files. One file is created for each attempt at a boss. So this is a lot of attempts in a short amount of time, that's what the picture is about.
---
Fair enough, scratch that part then.
---
I'm coming back to the game now, was just looking for a good story summary!
---
Fractals change quite a bit, as you may have seen among these comments, there are even very recent changes that affect how well co-ordinated groups can push faster through it by going against what I say \^\^   
---
Its one thing that keeps me doing, or at least coming back to, fractals. It feels like there is constant progression  
---
A wild Azubat appears !
---
Surely horns could also be used in combat? Both offensively and defensively? 
---
&gt; Herald is not a support spec, really.
---
I disagree completely, sorry. Yes, there's no class in the game that is completely forced into being a support, but Herald is definitely designed to be played as a tanky boon support. This is why the Rune of the Herald gives toughness and boon duration -- the 2 stats that Anet envisioned the class to use.
---
Herald's niche as a class is its ability to grant a ton of boons to 10 targets (when traited) permanently through pulsing pbAoEs. It's weapon, the shield, is also supportive in the same ways (healing and boons). 
---
The fact that people are playing Heralds in PvP with huge DPS builds is a design failure if you ask me. There's nothing wrong with giving people options when it comes to their builds, but the design team seems to always flop when it comes to what their elite specs are best at compared to what they want them to be best at (just look at all the DPS Firebrands in PvE, for example).
---
All I have left is Tangled Depths on one character.  What's the best way to hop onto the train for TD?
---
Man, I really wish I was allowed to make a worse product for the sake of making my workload easier and spending less time on tasks at my own job!
---
Just to toss it out there: seraphs and plaugedoctors are tied to episodes in ls3 and ls4 (Lake Doric and Kourna) and Diviners is tied to the latest one. 
---
IMO, LS3/some eps of 4 are really good for other tricky gear propositions for alts and alternate gear sets so I'd maybe consider getting some or all the following if your goal is Just The Gear:
---
* Rising Flames/Ember Bay (accessory)
---
* A Crack In The Ice/Bitterfrost Frontier (everything else)
---
* Head of the Snake/Lake Doric (seraphs)
---
* Daybreak/Istan (money, though less then it was)
---
* A Bug In the System/Sandswept Isles (the only map in LS4 so far with trinket/ring/accessory)
---
* Long Live The Lich/Kourna (plaugedoctors/the roller beetle)
---
Wow, this outfit looks absolutely horrible. It's like they had an idea to make something cute/sexy but some SJW/feminist was like "NO!" to it mid being made and completely ruined it.
---
What a joke, lol.
---
Thanks for all the advice and info!
---
It costs my employer more money (in my time) for me to make high quality products, but they still want me to do it and not cut corners.
---
2 hours is very little for Dhuum CM, especially without the scourge strategy being as revelant now. It took my group closer to 500 pulls but perhaps with power creep it is easier now.
---
You also might want to make sure that compression is on for those logs if it gets close to that number! 
---
Minis have infusions now??
---
I love the outfit.
---
I hate the dye pattern.
---
Every outfit is treated like single armor piece so it gets only 4 channels, but it never felt as restrictive to me as with this outfit. It's not fashion wars, it's war against fashion.
---
It’s basically the wild wild pussycats from my hero academia.

There is plenty of clipping and flying shoulderpads on humans as well btw

New year

hi WP, I was wondering when you'd show up xD I've gotten pretty good at timing the train, so there's a 99% chance that we'll be finished with auric basin by 5 PM (CST). you can jump in any time in the next half hour, during the time that I use to set up the next map.
---
whisper or just check lfg! :D
---
Sure we do ^^ now we do it even more ^^

I did notice how... off? Rytlocks face was in the art, not to diminish the work of the original artist, they're clearly very talented but your edit here is a lot closer to the actual appearance of Rytlock in-game and from other art.
---
I try not to judge too harshly but yea, this. They burnt through all the content with too much time, sorry but that's going to happen to any decent game. They really ought to try a super grindy korean MMO where it'll take you a year to go 1 level towards "max" that'll address the content drought.
---
To be perfectly honest I would preferr single armor pieces instead. Outfits are nice looking but there barely any customization in it. Furthermore I can't really understand why making armor would be so hard. Yes I know you have 3 model sizes * how many ajacent armor + a charr tail to look out for. But is that not what zoning is for? Just create 7 (6 armor 1 backpack) areas on the 3 base models for each armor peice. Then build the mesh so it only fits in the zone. After that make a tail hole in the charr armor and your done.
---
yes, I reset and did it last, same problem
---
Some zoological offtop ahead, but I need it to explain my view on the matter.
---
One of the reason why we see functional horns and likes (antlers, etc.) primarly on herbivores is because they aren't cost-efficient for predators. Deer uses antlers to rival for mates or fight off predators. 
---
Predators on the other hand? They have entire bodies made for killing. Muscle structure, claws, fangs, often better senses than its prey. Horns made for combat would be counterproductive as teeth can generally do the same thing (impaling and making prey bleed out) better and with more precision. In both cases animal is risking head injury, but the risk is lower when you can hit once and not care for horns aligning correctly (and not breaking against a skull). And when it comes to blunt damage... I am pretty sure that Charr's punch or just straight forward headbutt would do better trick. 
---
So, while Charr horns are neat and can be useful sometimes (and their "overkill" nature is cool), I don't feel that Charrs really need those in most cases as their entire bodies are muscular killing machines, equipped with sharp claws and teeth.
---
As a good warrior pvp player (I assume so since you're a coach), would the discord just give me a giant amount of hate and insults for playing rifle warrior ?
---
Honestly, fractals are amazing. Really. I love how it totally mixes up the game.
---
Actually just finished 2 snow zones in roughly 4 hours. You are right they were my favorite from gw1 and they are still stunning as ever!
---
Righto sir. Actually what initially happened was I bought this game in 2012, was still in college but had to drop out. After a few moves and a period of being homeless I could never get back my account. I lost the box and lost most of my belongings. But hey right now new gaming pc, great job and a lot of time to play :)
---
&gt; Let's see how many of those examples were added in the past two years... the WvW/PvP. Other than your examples we and three sets that came with PoF, and... some Dhuum pieces and two more from LS? I can't really remember because I just skipped most of them as they aren't something I would call good looking, or cool, or cute.
---
Just because you didn't find them good looking so they must hold true for everyone else,  right? 
---
&gt; You can literally go into a populated hub and count in your fingers the amount of players using pieces from those because most of them are pure overdesign and work terrible outside of their own set.
---
I mean you can do the same and count how many people are not using outfits because 1)  they cost gems 2) they can't be customized.
---
&gt; And you know what I meant by saying "mounts are gemstore" exclusives and the fact that all you can get by playing is literally some basic looking mount with a single dye channel that might as well not even be there for most of them.
---
You literally said "mounts",  so why should I assume you saying otherwise? Anyone who isn't into gw2 and browsing might get the impression they aren't PoF stuff but are actually sold in gemstone. 
---
Same, I’m gonna get the foefire set soon when it comes to the gem store? And I really want that wizard hat
---
Wait really? Last I looked they were selling for 400, and the only difference in price between crafting and selling is 600
---
Cool :)
---
This is so not true.
---
The models are done. The UV mapping are done. The bumpmaps are done. Everything is done.
---
The only thing that's left is to just cut the models apart for each piece.
---
This argument that it would cost so much more money is pure ignorance of people who have zero idea how this whole process works.
---
i'm pretty sure there's a couple of shaven horns in character creation.
---
also the horns being good handlebars might be less of a problem for charr because of their skeletal structure
---
Sir you underestimate a guy with 1500 hours in path of exile. The grind sir has always been real. I still play that and warframe :) each are equally great games
---
And it did NOTHING, after the banwave one of the top ranked pvp mesmer player was using fly hacks, meaning that during the whole ongoing season he was doing it and after the ban wave was unaffected. And anet ignored the streamer that reported it on his channel.
---
&gt; And in what world are outfits better for us than individual pieces?
---
There's no world where it's better.
---
People who say "It would cost more money" are completely ignorant to the process of making 3D models and importing/exporting them into the game.
---
About the only outfit I regularly use (I do own more than I care to admit) is the furry northern explorer one. I don’t know the name but it has a big furred hood and it looks great on my sylvari when they go tot he Shiverpeaks. 
---
The only other thing I can truly say positively about the outfit system is that it lets my characters wear something that might not normally fit their armor type. Armor for the light armor uses etc. 
---
the ironic thing is I've regretted every outfit (we're talking 2 in 6 years) I've ever made but not one armor. now I just dont buy outfits when I would instantly if they were armor even if they came out way slower. 
---
Though it's a selling point for the episodes after they're no longer free. Perhaps they just don't want to offer it in two places. Story content, fun maps, and achievements aside, the incentive to buy LWS3 could be ascended trinkets and back items. The extra incentive to buy LWS4 would be more mounts, masteries for mounts, and perhaps maps that are better for gold farming.
---
Shorn horn.
---
&gt; What I am saying is this: choosing to NOT do the achievements is choosing to willingly avoid or ignore a very large percentage of the developers' efforts, and miss quite a significant portion of the game and world.
---
Many of the achievements are just a matter of repeating the story sections. I am pretty sure the OP is not saying that you can't repeat the story sections.
---
His artwork is very good, not debating that, but even in that example if he had just left out the whiskers...
---
Hey Anet I'm not saying you should hire this guy but you should at least cut him a royalty check and put his name in the credits. 
---
That may have been what was said. Does not mean that is what is true.
---
I really really really want a white stag for my Sylvari.
---
And I didn't know how much I needed a winged snake until just now.
---
I wish he'd stop shuffling his eye-colour.
---
The "having herbivore features despite being a carnivore" part reminds me a bit of the krogan from mass effect - they have their eyes on the side of their head to notice danger easier, among other things, because the planet they evolved on is just that dangerous. Maybe a similar logic could be applied to charr, but I'm rather thinking their design is just about looking cool than making sense, and I'm fine with that too.
---
Meanwhile ANet continues to pretend they give a fuck about visual noise ...
---
Yes.
---
A whole Mordrem mount pack would be neat.
---
Griffin's could be skinned as teragriffs.
---
And he's not the only one.
---
So you are saying that they can use the exact same model that they have used that takes a single thing into consideration (the rest of the outfit) for something that could need to take hundreds of things into consideration? 
---
More like the three most interesting characters. The original cast from LW2 was pretty one dimensional and boring back when they were introduced, and they haven't gotten any better.
---
Compare that to Gorrik, which is one of the best characters (in my opinion). Taimi had years of development, and she's still insufferable. Gorrik? He's perfect, and miles ahead as a character.
---
I think the new story team is doing a far better job than the previous one in this aspect. I'm kinda sad it took this long to see it shine, but I'm pretty glad to see we finally got what the game deserved.
---
I think Rox is going to leave us, Taimi is going to die (possibly ascending to rest in peace with Blish), Braham will probably die too (or change drastically), and both Marjory and Kasmeer will just retire. It's time for new characters.
---
Skeletons.
---
Honestly, the most consumer friendly option would be to release the outfit, MADE UP of all of the individual pieces. You buy it from the gemstore, you get an outfit version that you can use for alts that doesn't have customizable parts, but you unlock each piece individually for your wardrobe, and get single use applicable skin tokens for each piece in the first instance. 
---
Further applications would be through transmutation. The consumer wins as they get the freedom of choice and more value for their purchase. Anet wins because they give the consumer more incentive to make gem store purchases, thereby increasing sales.
---
I for one have NEVER bought an outfit for the simple fact that I don't see the point in looking like everyone else if I'm level 80, and until an alt of mine even hits 80, I don't care enough to spend any money on it because I haven't made the time investment yet. 
---
I'm not a graphic designer / developer but surely the amount of work involved in creating this option isn't more than its worth to them financially?
---
Just look at how bad they are at matching armor pieces, that corsair set they released since PoF doesnt fit with any other armor set, they've given up.
---
I'm saying they should do that **instead** of outfits.
---
Just give us Braham's fuckin helmet man
---
Doesn't that Person with the Gift also require the one from WvW? So how do you 'buy' it?
---
IIRC there is at least one with both.
---
Yes, that's what I meant, sorry. I phrased it poorly but I did do a clean install already (twice, actually)
---
I hope that's not the reason either, because it's dumb as hell, considering Braham is black-ish and Gorrik is actually voiced by a black man (by far my favorite voice actor).
---
But it'll still be balanced because it will have the most OP engage skill.
---
"Quaggan?"
---
"Yes, Commander?"
---
"Rage."
---
You should get your Profession to 500 and already start your Asc weapons. And definetely do some HoT Metas
---
If u're thinking about selling it don't take his offer, they usually sell for 500 - 600 g.
---
That's the whole point of alliances, to group up people who like to play with each other.
---
I just generally hate most outfits, the designs are just silly. This one included.
---
Good idea to expand the characters this way at this point of story. Gives story depth to those who are more committed to the game and eases the wait between episodes.
---
Lore is pretty neat. Writing felt a bit syruppy, especially for a legion Charr, even if it was introspection.
---
A bit iffy on the small branching structure.
---
Actually waiting for the market place to be available. I have the list of things to buy to powerlevel :)
---
Oh and You should go to DR to buy the 16 Divine Envelopes to sell them once your Acc is able to
---
I would love to join this Saturday! One question: do I need to have finished the HoT story already in order to be able to access any of the map content? Or am I good to go as long as I've progressed enough to unlock basic gliding and that's it?
---
uhm you get contracts literally from everwhere in PoF. events, sand hills, chests. you can easily farm all of that daily.
---
Qadim CM is way easier because 100% of the fight is scripted and (if we forget about the little bugs that can happen), averything always happen the same way so it's 100% down to how well you can execute the fight while Dhuum CM has a lot of RNG added to it: Echo movement, who get the bomb or who get the chackle (a bit unrealistic to go control this one reliably in CM imo).
---
Some nice art there, but this one is my favorite so far :D.
---
Yeh. It's also a continent that lost contact with Tyria for like what? 250 years?
---
It was out of the ordinary back then. Now we can't move without stumbling on magitech, spaceships, extradimensional beings and places, ...
---
Every other piece of armor, including the racial and gender differences of those pieces?
---
[The following foes may sitll have one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Unshakable&amp;limit=500)
---
It's time for new characters because you don't like the current ones?  Yeah... No, not really a good or well-thought reason.
---
I'm not against the outfit system. I like the option of being able to change my look instantly, especially during seasonal events, without having to spend all the transmutation charges. That being said, I'm also not against having some of the outfits be released as armor skins, or just more full armor skin sets in gem store in general. I feel like it sorely needs it and people are more likely to spend money on that due to all the customization options.
---
Obviously, they had horns before armors, and their purpose was to protect their GIGANTICLY LONG necks.
---
Depends on how much you've missed, and how much you want spoiled.
---
There's actually cut horns in character creation. If you select them and slide all the way to the smallest size, they look like small stumps.
---
I doubt charr have evolved naturally, it's more likely they are the result of magic merging ungulate, humanoid and feline traits into a single kind of creature sometime in the ancient history of Tyria. Like how magic has merged some grubs and sloths into slubs, or how some corrupted dragon minions grow draconic features like horns and back spikes.
---
Horns have more users other than fighting. They  also show the health of the creature, and they may be used for sexual selection. A charr without horns likely looks less attractive than one with prominent horns.  
---
A charr who has large horns, a great military record and keeps their horns intact is quite possibly a better fighter than someone who has a similar record, but got their horns cut. 
---
Many likely keep their horns because of fashion or pride. 
---
And charr have been learning to fight with horns for ages. Who needs to cut their horns or their tail for practical reasons if those reasons do not really affect them?
---
...What?
---
The pieces are already in-game. People are using them.
---
Separating them doesn't change that. What are you talking about?
---
But this isn't an asura. I thought you were devoted to the master race. What is this betrayal?
---
Pretty nice anyway. You're pardoned because he's supposed to have one at his belly. This time.
---
Perfect, thank you. Hope to be there!
---
I grinded through Orr killing mobs for my XP. Since Orr is (arguably) dead content since HOT, it has a fairly low population. Mobs that haven't been killed for a while have an increased XP drop, and I'm not talking just Veterens. Standard mobs (if you kill the ones that haven't been killed in a while), drop up to 7-10k EXP per kill if memory serves me right.
---
You know, that would be surprisingly cool--especially if they could juke them to have a slightly different feel, like maybe trading shorter jumps from the tiger for quicker stamina or quicker speed overall, or different handling on the winged serpent. Something to create more preferences.
---
This unfortunately did not work.  
---
Those can be particularly obnoxious. Like enemies who got defiance bars but didn't lose their natural immunity to most stuns, like Champion Risen Abominations.
---
What would have made sense is giving risen abominations a locked defiance bar, and unlocking it when they are going to start a strong attack. 
---
I'm not so against the whiskers, cats have them too. I guess he wanted it to look a bit more realistic or something, I don't know.
---
Rounding.
---
Have you seen the original though? It's not that different than the meme. I edited this from the original.
---
How do people go about "selling" a GoE?
---
I've got several that I'm not using, and I would rather have the gold.
---
I think he still looked like a rodent, but big, mean, and scary Rytlock can cry and I don’t think it takes away from his character. If anything I think it adds to it. He’s not some one dimensional “gut anything in my way and damn you if you’re not on board” cliche anymore. Bottom line is the artist has a hard time conveying otherwise human emotions through an otherworldly character. That’s all there really was to it.
---
I think the biggest mistake with mount development was the skin system. You want to customize a mount? Buy a skin. That's it, no further customization.
---
With how detailed GW2 mounts are, they could have allowed different tiers of customization instead:
---
* Skin pattern (stripes, snake rings).
---
* Body features (spikes, more hair).
---
* Aura effect (ghostly, starbound).
---
* Gear (different chair).
---
* Mount class (different base model).
---
And each of the above independent from each other.
---
Yeah, that seems about right. But even if Rytlock does cry, it doesn't mean he suddenly completely changes facial structure and everything xP It's more interesting as an *addition* to his character, not a replacement.
---
There was a multi-passenger rhino leaked during PoF's early days, I wonder if it ever made it past the testing phase.
---
Count me in!! On EU as well, this is a great idea, and I'm also trying to get into raids
---
Could be rounding mistakes. The coefficients for Harrier's [are 0.35 for power, and 0.25 for healing/concentration](https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/itemstats?ids=1363&amp;lang=en). If the [item hidden value](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/itemstats#cite_note-ref1-1) is 358 for one-handed and 716 for two-handed, you'll get 250.6/179 for the staff and 125.3/89.5 for the axe and horn. They round to what you observe.
---
And mounted combat!
---
I second this, that sounds awesome, especially with all the updates to underwater content. 
---
Now he looks like he is wondering if he left his oven on. 
---
I love it.
---
This is why most historical helms had no ornaments, and the few which had broke easily.
---
So the alliances are essentially mega guilds, and are chosen by the guilds themselves?  Does this mean I'll need to negotiate joining an alliance for my guild?  So my only option to continue to play alongside the commanders I like would be to ally with their guild or join their guild.  
---
I'm not really wanting to dump my friendly small guild tag, and I can't imagine the good wvw guilds will want to ally with anything but the best. So I guess we'll be stuck with rng teams.
---
I don't think Abominations are in that category. Aboms are like all the dungeons elites. They are just completely immune.
---
I miss the mordrem too, and the chak. I hate how ArenaNet develops such cool enemies and then we never see them ever again.
---
Ugh, after looking at the video in more detail, I now realize that buffs and boons are not the same thing in this game. After enabling class specific buffs I'm over 20k which seems to at least be in the ballpark.
---
For my last legendary, instead of doing wvw for gift of battle I just bought a ton of keys. If Anet wants my money, they can put ways to skip wvw in the black lion chests all day
---
Raid. Every. Single. Week.
---
No we should recruit the forged to finish the job and kill Kralkatorrik! As far as we know they can't be corrupted either so... :P
---
Once you unlock skills/specialization, you can freely swap them when out of combat.
---
Things you cannot change (or has a small cost to change):
---
* you cannot change a character’s class (ranger, guardian, warrior, etc)
---
* you cannot change your personal story
---
* you cannot change stats on gear on gear exotic or lower (aka can only change stats on gear that is top tier stats) - but you can get new gear, it just costs in game resources
---
The reason I mention it is that you can pretty easily see the effect of a game being sub based.
---
Are you seriously saying that the current model is working for GW2? I can see pretty clear signs of struggle + the reason for not releasing an expansion any time soon is clearly because it's more efficient to develop gem store items and smaller patches. NCSoft is pretty keen on GW2 making profits and earlier they wanted to push expansions out FASTER, clearly after we entered the current gem store era it was realized to be more profitable to not do that.
---
I'm just saying, it's pretty sad when you can see so clearly how the state of the game is almost purely driven based on immediate profits, and that's why I bring the comparison to sub games, that aren't affected by crap like this.
---
Explain.
---
Oh I have no delusions about the issues charr face with clipping and stretching, I just see it as a challenge instead of an obstacle. That said, I really only assemble one armor set for charr a year, as most of mine tend to be PvP alts. Still haven't attempted charr light armor though, I hear that's the definitive worst/hardest fashion war. 
---
Is this map completion furry friendly? 😸
---
As someone who's really loved the Zaishen and Balthazar since Factions came out, and who felt a great personal betrayal with him being our opponent and enjoyed playing a human Commander who felt this betrayed, I love everything about your comment and I really want to see a bunch of this go forward on screen. 
---
Yeah, I think the appeal (for me anyway) is more in the realm of "you now have a solo, PvE alternative to what might otherwise have forced you into group content (dungeon tokens) or a mode you don't enjoy (GoB)".
---
I'd kill for either TPable gifts of battle, a merchant that let you trade gifts (even at a given exchange rate where you might need multiple gifts for another, or lots of some other resources combined...), or being able to set your XP bar to get a GoB instead of spirit shards...or just let us buy GoB for spirit shards.
---
This is my current working theory, so yes. Does not make it any less heart wrenching.
---
Shit thats a good idea, follows the trend of "everyone join the commander cause he killed a god and a king" thats been going on. Id be happy to fight alongside them
---
It's for the PPs, yes.
---
Emi's trains are the best! Super fun, super knowledgeable commander. Would 100% recommend joining if you're even just the littlest bit interested. 
---
~~\^(also hi Emi it's Dama)~~
---
Looking also for some nice story summary till episode 3 PoF. Didn't find any. 
---
1. You can respec at no cost as long as you're out of combat.  Further, you will get enough skill points to unlock all skills and traits, so once you have explored enough, you can literally use ANY build.
---
2. No.  The only important things before the expansions offer before max level are:
---
* Access to the Revenant class
---
* Allows you to get daily login rewards (some of which are pretty good profit, especially for a new player)
---
* Removal of trading post restrictions so you can sell materials for money
---
* Ability to talk in map chat.  Map chat can be extremely helpful if you just have random quick questions.  But the subreddit and reddit discord are pretty good about that too.
---
&gt;Story is done too x) sorry I have a huge work ethic and doing nothing all day is driving me nuts.
---
Where can one find such ethic?
---
Yeah. but immunities are just bad.
---
And they are not totally immune, you can Launch them.
---
With  Wurms, they are immune to launch and knockback, but they can be stunned, knocked down and feared. and that makes sense since they can only move when they are undeground. 
---
But for enemies like giants and abominations it would have made more sense to update them to a breakbar, like other large creatures that are not supposed to be pushed around, but can still be stunned by breaking the bar, like mordrem nuhoch, djinns and hydras.
---
Just go full Diviner trinkets it should be fine. Chrono builds change so much it's the easy solution for now.
---
I'd like some minor variations in the mount physics and stuff, but this is also how I vision mounts going forward tbh.
---
also because i really fucking want a charr car mount please god
---
Celestial dragon and Kirin please, thanks 
---
This. I've bought a lot of outfits and regret almost every one, but never regretted buying a proper skin set. 
---
x)

You have no idea.

&gt;They must have been aware that md5 hashing can result in collisions.

of course they were, that's why the first thing that cunt gaile grey did post was that anet won't allow any appeals regarding those bans. you can check her forum post about that yourself

GIVE US THE WYVERN MOUNT ANET

Does it need to last another 6 years. Think about all the games you play and how many you’ve played for more than a year.

It's sad how this awesome piece of writing with a ton of awesome lore bombs got so sidetracked by people complaining about an image that's still very good, but not to some people's liking.

One of the legendary Staves; [Nevermore](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nevermore) or [Bifrost](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Bifrost). They would be well worth your time.

Asuran hover boards as skimmers, please. Either shaped like snowboards or Warhammer Magus discs.

Just make sure you don't have one button press interacting with multiple launched instances. This is where you start to run into trouble, given that they observe your accounts doing the same thing at speeds impossible for humans, ie farming all home instance nodes with five accounts near instantly or have instances with afk'd necro characters farming ghosts. This will land you in hot water quick.
---
The developer is working to add in support for the lack of a -password cmdline option and resort to either making copies of the config .dat and use network auth autologin. Monday he had basic changes committed already and I'll check progress tonight. He is very active on the project.
---
Im not ! I just said i LOVE asura ! &lt;3
---
It's not about clipping massively with other armor. It's about the fact each individual armor piece of each weight has it's own attatch points and fitting on the races. They don't do it not because they may clip with some random pair of boots, but because the pair of pants may just end up half way through your body or have a giant hole in your chest. 
---
The clipping excuse is the reason. People think all clipping is "Oh no my charr's tail goes through the leg slightly". The way regular armor pieces actually attach and sit on your character means that if you took every single outfit and chopped it up into individual pieces and just slapped it on like people demand. Then you'd have giant holes in your character and pants the start in the middle of your stomach at times.
---
Do you remember Thunderhead? Tall, storm powers. Nice man. Good with kids. November 15th of '58. All was well, another day saved when

---
It's well drawn, but you'd think it would look like the character it's meant to be yknow. Valid complaint when it's such a prominent image in all of this.
---
Or look for Quickbrand/Alac Rene
---
To be honest support Regade and support Firebrand both have higher dps than Druid and higher dps than the old outdated Chrono. So if you want literally no challenge play both with 3 dps. Healing and boon uptime is so ridiculous that you can face tank all mechanics. \^\^' (And yeah I know other Quickbrand/Alacrene combo are faster.)
---
There are a few things that could be at play here. A recent upgrade to Windows 10 that coincides with the issue starting indicates to me that something related to the upgrade could have affected how the game is performing for you. As for how to determine exactly what that is, that's a little tricky!
---
GW2 will of course run better on an SSD, but it will still be fine on an HDD, just a little bit slower to load assets and things like that. The HDD may be having some issues and that could be causing the problem as well, but that's just speculation.
---
One thing you might want to check is your pagefile (virtual memory) size. If you are running out of virtual memory, Guild Wars 2 might be encountering issues like what you are seeing. You can do this on Windows 10 by doing the following:
---
1. Click the Windows icon
---
2. Search for "Advanced System Settings"
---
3. Click the "Advanced" tab
---
4. Click the "Settings" button
---
5. Click the "Advanced" tab
---
6. Under Virtual Memory, click "Change"
---
By default Windows 10 manages this automatically for all connected drives (but I've found it can be really bad at it!). I am guessing that you may be running out of either disk space on the HDD, or space for virtual memory. You can manually set your virtual memory size here by unchecking "Automatically manage ..." and selecting a custom size, then clicking Set.
---
At the bottom of that pane, you'll see "Total Paging File for all Drives". If setting a custom size, try to choose something a bit bigger than what it's showing. I found that setting mine to 20GB (20000MB) works great for all games.
---
***Disclaimer: This is only speculation, but it's a start on something to try! I hope it helps.***
---
I highly recommend Emi's trains. They're my favorite method for HoT map completion, and getting hero points is so much easier when there are 100 players.
---
I won't be able to join the start this time around, but I definitely want to do Tangled Depths, so I'll probably hop on before 5 PM CST.
---
The crash is within [D3DXCreateFont](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dxcreatefont) (use those for drawing things like the healthbar overlay, debug info, and quite a bit in my own tools). If I comment it out the game loads, but ImGui never draws anything
---
Not necessarily true. Usually the only way someone buys a GoE for this amount is if the 77 clovers are included. The average cost of GoE alone is between 350 and 400. At least from my exoerience of buying GoE multiple times.
---
Thats really good, like it
---
Then you have never been in a good group? There are fractals (Thaumanova, for example) that take less than 5-10 minutes to do properly. Normally you should not need more than half an hour for T4 dailies.
---
Calling them silver surfers when they clearly ride their hoverboards like Green Goblin, smh.
---
"armor takes a long time to make" has always been a piss poor excuse to me :/ 
---
1. Yes, though gear is a little more rigid (in the sense that swapping stats involves either having legendary armor or having multiple sets). Can't go wrong with full power for leveling though. Worry about wich stats you want when you get close to 80.
---
2. No, though once you are at max level you will want the expansions for those sweet sweet mounts/gliders, elite specs and *all* the extra content. It's perfectly viable to play without them but you will cave eventually.
---
Also, are you making a f2p account or buying the core game (without expansions)?
---
Also also, Tybalt, introduction.
---
Yes, commander

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
Yes. Read https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/airpza/undocumented_bugfix_griffons_cannot_infinitely/ and then https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ak3wsx/how_to_gain_infinite_altitude_on_griffin_with_s4/
---
Same. Came here just to say that. They look GREAT just not the rest. 
---
Doubt so. Afaik if u just dive for a very small long, you can't updraft it again, maybe I'm wrong, but I could never do it.
---
And for "normal/long" dives its working fine so...
---
Do people really need to die though? Just keep doing what they've been doing: send some cronies off on a subplot for a few episodes so we don't have to see them. They're still relevant, they're just not on-screen all the time. Easy.
---
I don't think you should dwell on a kick from a commander who can't perform the role he chose.
---
Sure. To each their own.
---
From what limited knowledge we have though, still doesn't seem it should be all that cost-prohibitive to cut the outfits up and offer both. 
---
+1 to this. I rock Touch of Fog with my Reaver of the Mists and I love the look.
---
I do miss their hoverboards and want one badly...
---
the game is dead anyways
---
It's not a bad edit, but one thing I note - in the original, he's looking back at Logan. This replaces that glance with more of a shellshocked expression. I would imagine that's not inappropriate here, but I don't know that that detail needed to be lost. 
---
(Honestly, I don't see why the whiskers had to go away. Maybe they were too prominent, but they don't need to disappear. It's not like you can see them on Skritt in-game, either, but everyone associating them with Skritt-like qualities seems to be forgetting that.)
---
No, I absolutely agree. The argument has no merit because most armors have a clipping issue of some sort. Hell, look at any character that uses any height/weight combo that isn't default -- the armor gets an ugly, stretched look, and shoulders hover.
---
However, that is the reason they give, and it DOES exist, so it is a valid reason. It just doesn't make sense when you look at how common clipping issues are regardless, even in outfits. If they made it a personal goal to remove all clipping and stretching issues in established outfits and armors, then I'd agree entirely with their reasoning. But, they don't.
---
Honestly that sounds like bad hardware, I know that cause I play the game on a potato. This game is terribly optmized and not only you need a cpu with good single core performance but you also need a SSD to get reasonable loading speeds. Reinstalling drivers or allocating more virtual memory will most likely do nothing for you.
---
Deleted the post so you dont get this wrong. I dont really understand what you mean though.
---
Yeah I personally never ever buy outfits as they seem to me like a way make your character look "cool" but unoriginal which is just meh. However I see other people shelling out cash to Anet for them all the time, so clearly they sell and obviously people want them. I just accept that I am not the target audience for this sort of item. At least Anet is funding the servers in a method that doesn't negatively effect me.
---
As someone who collects a good portion of the outfits, I'll say that isn't really the case.
---
I have my alts dressed in outfits because it's convenient and makes it easy to make them look nice, while I prefer a more customized look on my main and hunt skins for it.
---
They're not immune to more recent CC effects, such as slow
---
Give us more armor skins ffs. 
---
ikr? i headcanon that one of my charr has an issue with horns growing in on their shoulders, and it causes some... issues
---
Well, actually the values should end up being the same internally.. they just round to whole numbers when they are displayed.
---
Devs are lazy and you let them be that way by not boycotting outfits, so enjoy your half-baked shit content xD
---
There's something of a statement in that when I first saw the 'actual' image (on this sub, not Anet's website), I thought it was a photoshop with the [sad cat meme image](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/026/489/crying.jpg).
---
Yours honestly looks much closer to what I imagined the 'original' would have looked like.
---
I switched to ffxiv recently and its so nice to have a feeling of immersion again.
---
I miss that so much in gw2.
---
The eyes actually gave me the most trouble because I couldn't tell where his pupils were due to the over-texturing, so I just kind of guessed and they really didn't come out how I wanted.
---
As for the whiskers, it is far beyond my skill level and the abilities of my software (I'm using a crappy drawing app on my phone) to make the whiskers look good. I was barely able to remove them at all. I don't think the whiskers are what makes him look like a skritt in the original. It's the sizr and shape of the snout, especially the nose. The issue with the whiskers is that they're so long and visible it gives him an almost cuter appearance, if that makes sense.
---
anet just never heard of  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone%27s_ratio
---
more like they perverted it and turned it into the opposite.
---
I just hear and see all of this from some Asuran approximation of that character. 
---
This bookah don't care, this bookah takes risks to look flashy and good.... This bookah also suspects that Missiles, Jet Turbines and express elevators are something Tyria lacks to make this an adequate argument..... 
---
That could be the case, my machine is a bit older (though I wouldn’t necessarily put it in the potato group yet). Using the recent dx12 patch that was posted to the subreddit has helped me out and the bug occurs less. So I’m trying everything!
---
NA has a lot of bandwaggoning.  As I understand it, most of the players from Mag simply hopped servers instead of quitting.  VR is in FC (the link server carrying YB).  KEK left to FA long ago, even Packit left to Ehmry Bay.  
---
As for the original question, you can see "activity" here.  https://wvwstats.com/timezones .

Aurene mount when...
---
SHE USES THE GRIFFON RIGGING. SHE MUST BE RIDDEN.
---
i was really hoping to be in this... 
---
Appreciated xD 
---
It's from Mythic+ imo.
---
The simplistic is great, I recognize basic armor and honestly because of that it really feels like "setting of toward adventure" plus the butterfly, simple and nicely done!
---
I was really hoping to be in this.
---
My only concern with this is that to do this, I would hope they would provide a free default skin for the new version, otherwise locking something like a new mount behind a gamble/2000 gems
---
So if a cheater knows their program is flagged by spyware, can they just simply alter it one bit and have it be undetected again?  (until whatever caused the original detection flags it again)
---
Yes but it's not like a master artisan and skilled warrior wouldn't have a selection of weapons at her disposal. 
---
It's ed from the lion king, I don't really watch anime tbh
---
Thanks ^^
---
I'm sorry I don't understand could you please elaborate further. 
---
I really want to buy a few infusions now to get a "WTF" reaction from my guild
---
Man fuck capes.  I want a goddamn cloak.
---
Dont be "sdyawg, AE 1300. cape caught on Waypoint edges"
---
This is one of the few fanarts that I think is actually very well done! It's your own style, not overly complex, just all around a great drawing!
---
I haven't convinced her to start playing just yet. As I'm pretty new myself. And kingdom hearts 3 just came out. She is all over that currently. 
---
But that's what the entirety of my comment is about, that you then refute?
---
I just demanded that data and lots and lots of other data that they couldn't give me (or at least they said so), so probably they tried to calm me down with the cheat log data instead of gathering even more data that they would have to redact. 
---
As for the fact that the data protection authorities can't do anything: That's wrong, as a firm does not have to have legal representation in the EU or Germany but only have their targets market there. Which is the case for ArenaNet. They even host their EU servers within Germany. That's the whole point about the GDPR, so you can sue companies in the US that gather, store and work with your personal data. I would try to reach out to them again and properly explain the situation. 
---
That's incredible.
---
And then Holosmith came out.
---
Hm my thoughts on the next elementalist would be an Elemental Archer- Uses a shortbow and applies elemental damage/conditions to attacks.
---
And the fact that it would have been easier for them to just put vendor value on luck essences, if this pure gold conversion was actually the intended sink.
---
Seems fine to me. \*shrug\*
---
and imgui implementation you use is https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/examples/imgui_impl_dx9.h ?
---
They are outfits, they arent ment for people to stand out as having some sort of individual fashion.
---
Many reasons why they decided selling outfits instead of full armor sets in pieces thats been talked over again and again trough out the years.
---
Youll just have to create a unique look using actual armor pieces like i do
---
3 questions:
---
1. How do you get your luck to 956%?
---
2. How in the world do you get 25k envelopes?
---
3. Is that 35k gold? You made 35k gold?? I must be playing this game wrong......i feel like that level of gold is so far beyond me.
---
Well it worked. 
---
It's 40% profit, more if you count all the TPable items (food ...)
---
If you just buy your own 16 envelopes/day for the duration of the event (presumably 22 days), you earn 140g out of nowhere.
---
Yeah, I stick mostly to open world and by the time I got my commander tag I was pretty comfortable leading stuff like world bosses (the ones I'd done regularly) and many metas.
---
AB is probably the one I'm most familiar with, and in a chicken/egg dynamic, it's the one I tag up for the most. 
---
When I do it, I'll usually take west or south, since they're usually the ones that, if there's gonna be a problem, it'll be there. I'll get there early, tag up, post to LFG with IP and side, then first order of business is getting people to set up on the other lanes.
---
Once we have structure, then I encourage even split, and once I have my gang, I ask in squad chat if it's anyone's first time, or if they want a brief rundown.
---
If so, I explain the mechanics, point out any major concerns, and then indicate priority (i usually run west, so I'll explain that your to-do list is breachers first if any of them are up, then frogs, then the vine last, leaving bushes for armor, and then instruct the armor that they should focus on frogs first, then pushing bushes from in front of the vine and along edges and getting them into the center. They should ignore the vine.
---
If we need to hold up and wait on another side, I go down front and center in front of the vine and on the local "say" chat I repeat STOP or HOLD.
---
If I call a stop, usually others will comply and repeat. But then if you call a stop, you also need to call burn when it's time as well.
---
Nothing magical, and by this time it's old content, so 95%+ already know it, so you're basically a mentor with super powers of organization.
---
It definitely sounds cool, replace shortbow with longbow and you have me sold. Because it feels like you're describing Renegade but with the added benefit of Water/Air/Earth arrows
---
Anet would receive their investment back tenfold if they just separated the armour pieces. 
---
I know it would be a lot of work, but there are numerous outfits that I would buy just for one piece, and have decided not to because I don’t like the rest of the set. 
---
*High five*
---
The only way a "horned race" would work is if they have a lot of spinal force, so you can't actually impair them by holding the horns. Another alternative is using antlers instead of horns, because they break easily, and can also regenerate.
---
Same here, might be the reason why I play solo most of the time and have been playing game less and less but if I have to be honest joko dying in a shit way made me stop. But the anime/tera shit isn’t helping 
---
This is fekin' wonderful - added to my list of artists I'd buy commissions from for sure.
---
Engineers can launch rockets, which look like tiny missiles. The Pact Flagship has an engine that creates an updraft, so it works sonewhat like a turbine. Sylvari have seed elevators, and the Charr have regular elevators. Humans may have something similar, but who knows.
---
^^^^you ^^^^win ^^^^this ^^^^time
---
It would be way more work to make them pieces (outfits are actually one armor piece). Every outfit would be like an armor set, and an armor set needs, it was about 6 months iIrc, to create. 
---
They said that they want to make those armor pieces, which take all this work, to be obtainable ingame and not just via gemshop. 
---
So no, they won't make so much more money, they would hurt the game.
---
Can't you just right-click -&gt; open all?
---
I know it's not the point but I'm just sayin'......:P
---
That was just a cheap cameo, not unlike the ones karka have gotten now and then.
---
I have every Gem Store armor skin and only one Outfit for my lvl2 PvP slave and leveling alts to hide ugly low lvl gear. I would never wear Outfits on my lvl80s.
---
They only had major presence at a single zone, so yeah. Hope we see them again in the future, in another underground zone.
---
Oh man I hope they don't do that either. What a boring sink that would be. They did so damn well with the fractal sink. I spend relics every day now thanks to the clover sink, and the sense of account progression that I got when I was getting the fractal titles was really really great. I'm hoping for something along those lines. 
---
Thanks! This is pretty much what I've been doing, at least for core. I'm working on rank 3 mastery for fractals to get the better rewards. 
---
I also think Anet wont do that on purpose anymore. Though it reminds me of first wintersday &gt; boxes, snowflakes, snowflakes in mystic forge for more boxes and same for all clothes. Every round you had like 70% of all boxes in return, almost endless mystic forge clicking.
---
I'm just consistently amazed by the numbers people can achieve in this game. As I said, it just feels like something I could never do.
---
Thanks! I'm working my way through the mounts and masteries right now! 
---
The Elder Dildo.
---
Longbow or greatsword would be nice!
---
Thanks! Why are you hoarding XP boosters? 
---
That would have required Anet to do work though. All pre-HoT champions' defiance bar functions the exact same; meanwhile anything that wasn't champion/legendary ranked but had Unshakable kept it. They were pretty lazy about the change tbh.
---
The Silverwaste Bosses with [Indomitable](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Indomitable_(effect)) would have been another "just change to gray defiance". Instead they got defiance and Indomitable still.
---
Nice, thanks! 
---
You know that's because hats and outfits were released separately, don't you?...
---
Festive hats were there before any outfit came. So it's just the most logical way, if not the only way, to keep them separated. 
---
Thanks! Where did you do this? 
---
Any non-champion foe who had the old unshakable still has it.
---
And then there's the Champion Reef Shark in Southsun Cove which has it. Only champion to still have it, I believe.
---
Whenever is say this i get downvoted to hell
---
I've got all expansions, so any info helps! I appreciate it. 
---
This is a really important point that people need to realize. There's more to features like this than "make the art look good".
---
from vendor he got 1,7 silver per envelope but with 25k it's 425 gold, but that's just minor part of his profit, great lanterns are like 9g? that's almost double that, fireworks are ~1-2 silver, that's another ~300 gold, but the biggest profit is from food cuz it's around 10 silvers and he got almost 9k of this, that's basically 900 gold, so overall he got atleast 2k gold profit from this, and it basically just cost him time to buy envelopes from ppl
---
There's no doubt that it's the same system that evolved into what it is today though, especially since you can remove headpieces of outfits in GW2. 
---
&gt; Look at all the memes of outfits looking totally out of place on other races than human.
---
So your arguments are memes... nothing more to say.
---
It was a nerf because it was a bug they fixed
---
Yeah. And there's also enemies who have a locked breakbar that becomes breakable sometimes, and enemies with no breakbar at all that gets a breakable breakbar sometimes.
---
For large enemies that can't be pushed around like giants and hydras, what makes sense is to have the locked breakbar, but get the blue bar when they are about to do a nasty attack.
---
what is it with ele's and wanting a bow? 
---
like: skills, mechanics, lore? not important, eles want their bow. 
---
it's getting kinda weird
---
Is it still?
---
Good catch!  Thanks!
---
Thanks for the info! Can you recommend a place to do this? 
---
Thanks! I will keep this in mind. 
---
Those are particularly annoying. You can only break their bars with taunt and slow, since Indomitable wasn't updated to also work for them after they are added.
---
Nice! Thanks for the info! 
---
Unfortunately ANet stated we're going from LS4 (the next episode will be the final one) straight to LS5. If that is the case, if we presume 6 episode in LS5, and we'll count 2,5 months between episodes (so the same standards we are used to so far), that's 18 months before we see the next expansion. That, and I personally think that we will get a small hiatus between the two LS seasons (that's only my personal prediction, it was never confirmed nor denied). So unless ANet decides to release Elite specializations during the living story, I wouldn't expect them any time soon.  
---
Ignoring that, I'd like to either see new weapons, or new uses for the ones we have right now (main-hand focus etc). Otherwise, I'm just ready to be surprised. 
---
Could you be a bit more specific about what you mean by percentage? Movement speed? 
---
I like the outfits even as a level 80, because my ranger can wear cool robes like the Arcane robes, or have a very fancy outfit like the winter outfit or noble coat, otherwise I made my armor look like some kind of cascadian hipster
---
Don't really enjoy Holosmith, actually do like Scrapper though (mainly for the hammer) but anet must've forgotten about it or something so RIP. Maybe next xpac i'll have to see what Engi has in store.
---
I wasn't sure if he was already a Herald or just base Revanent when he came out of the mists, truthfully. I only really recall him using his sword, I don't remember what, if any, offhand he used.
---
Pretty nice. I wanted to get into that forge badly, but I guess I do not need to now.
---
Also, one of the terraces in the auditorium is never visited (top left). Anything there?
---
Thank you!! Commissions are in fact open so hit me up with a dm if you’re interested! :o 
---
Did you get another email before this one, as I got one last week, but only as a "potential winner"?
---
Most MMOs I've played have weekly lockouts for raids. Cosmetic groups run bosses for specific cosmetic drops, not for progression or achievements.  
---
A progression group on the other hand is really a different entity to a training group.  Just because the training group kills bosses, it doesn’t make it a progression group.  
---
Can I have your gold before you quit?
---
For getting hearts quicker, do any events in the area or start any if you see anyone with an orange circle over their head (also shows on minimap). Often the enemies you kill during the event will count towards the heart you're in, and events usually involve a lot of enemies. If a heart seems to be going slowly, try going somewhere else and come back later. Maybe an event will have appeared, or maybe someone had cleared out a lot of enemies or other stuff right before you arrived and they'll have respawned. 
---
Doesn't mean they have to make a system that has less features than the previous game.
---
You can also get "free" gems from certain achievement chests. I cant recall the exact numbers but maybe every 5k achievement points gets you 400 gems. 
---
Oh it looks like it was actually weapons and not armor, thanks!
---
&gt; This clipping excuse is nonsense. There are plenty of armor pieces, even recently released ones from PoF, that have clipping issues;
---
That argument only confirm the clipping reason. 
---
It shows perfectly how hard it is to avoid clipping , even if work on an armor piece/set for months. And that sometimes you can't avoid clipping. 
---
What's the new FB Ren combo? Harriers or diviners?
---
The comment that I originally brought up clipping. You responded to that comment by stating "the clipping excuse is the reason". What you are saying now is a different thing entirely. I am aware of the differences between designing outfits vs. armor as this conversation pops up on the sub every time an outfit is released. And yes, they are releasing outfits because it makes them money while saving time. I never implied otherwise. 
---
I feels like what you're mixing "content" and "artificial gating'.
---
HoT didn't have much more content than PoF, what it had though, is quite a lot of artificial gating through mastery and a lot of various grind for fractal lvl/armour sets/elite spec weapons/guild upgrade...
---
PoF could have lasted you a month too, if the devs decided to put the mastery grind at the same level as HoT. (which wouldn't have been a bad thing tbh)
---
But i'll agree with you on one point : on some areas, i'd like Anet to focus less on quality.
---
Pretty sure most raiders would rather have less polish on the presentation of the raid if that meant faster release cadence.
---
Every single excuse for outfits is a cover for:
---
"This takes less effort for the same sale price."
---
That's it, full stop.
---
The clipping excuse is bullshit
---
The "muh 9 months for armor" excuse is bullshit
---
Whatever else they've ever said is bullshit
---
Spellslinger Ele, baby! Gimme them double pistols
---
My group gave up on Dhuum and qadim cm after 2 hours of trying 😥
---
It's dumb not to buy the vendor one's daily which is kind of the point of the envelopes and event. Obviously the TP price adjusts itself to be about equal. 
---
This is still a bullshit point because said clipping only happens when you mix and match. Which is totally optional. Wearing a full set of gear rarely ever clips outside of weird shit like norn/charr problems.
---
All outfits do is solve the problem by removing the option of doing the thing that causes the problem.
---
It's like just banning people for profanity instead of providing a filter.
---
but where is fun in that? :D
---
No not movement speed ^^
---
I was talking about the mastery skills in my example gliding. I want to do raids but I need Ley Line Gliding, but I only got Updraft Use. So how do i level the master skills themselves (like "Lean Techniques", "Stealth Gliding", "Advanced Gliding", "Ley Lind Gliding") as fast as possible? I got enough Mastery points but not enough xp on these skills.
---
Chiming in:  on r/gw2economy (and in my personal post history) are detailed explanations as to how one can get to these sort of #s.
---
Sutgon's statement of "investing" is likely extremely accurate, if it looks at all like how I operate.
---
It's largely just finding consistent areas of high return, and leveraging them over time.  I certainly never dreamed of having 35k gold when I started flipping, I was aiming for "one legendary" (at that time, 1k) then "two legendaries" (4k) then "a full set for my main + money to keep flipping" (10k) and now it's just "whelp time to buy 4k orchestral skins, just another tuesday."  As IRL, wealth builds wealth.
---
I do wvw, it's meta for zerg fights (as scourge), that's about it for wvw. Pve I think currently the best build is a support scourge build, damage wise necro is pretty bad (the worst iirc), so don't be surprised if you are not wanted as dps.
---
https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/rpg?sortby=release%2B&amp;keywords=guild+wars+2&amp;discount_min=&amp;stype=4
---
Official retailer and almost always on sale.  Its $20
---
In a game with that much amount of skins, 5 different races plus all the variations you can choose at character creation, it's just not possible to avoid clipping completely. You can see clipping in every mmorpg and every game with that much armor skins.
---
Not being able to avoid clipping (no similar game is), is not the same as "don't care about clipping".
---
Well lucky for me i have devs in the family, not arena net but still game devs and that is why i have another understanding then those who screams for more content to people who finish them in 48 hours. 
---
Always wondered how people get out of bounds like this
---
&gt; No clue of the difference between armors and outfits.
---
What's the difference? Please enlighten us, oh random reddit dweller who clearly worked on this industry before.
---
I had the same pose for whole DS meta, great time with mesmer GS 4 skill :D
---
I'd disagree re. Scourge, they're not wanted in meta comps but for your typical PUG it's fine, as is Reaper. Anytime Siren's Reef with No Pain, No Gain is up it basically is the best class to bring.
---
Yes Please!
---
Does Engi's Elixir C (the Condi converter) count as Condi cleanse? Asking because I was curious if it'd be affected by the Purity of Purpose trait in alchemy.
---
Can't he just use /stuck for reseting him?
---
Beautiful keep up the good work!
---
Your guardian's magnificent thighs aside, that's my biggest pet peeve about the "we/they do outfits so we don't have to worry about clipping" argument... Half of the outfits clip with character models anyway.
---
If you have the episodes, let them teleport to you
---
for 2000 gems in gemstore \*soon\*
---
Hell, some of the outfits even clip

Green Surfers!
---
That was pretty detailed, thanks a lot! I'm glad I wont be useless for picking necro
---
Sell where ? On the TP ? And waste 15% of the total (base price+profit), which is more than half of the profit ? You call the "earn the same" ?
---
Same with the new maps.
---
Instead of making new ones over and over they should put more meaning to them (by putting new stuff into the existing ones).
---
&gt; its simply to make people actually play the game
---
You mean grind the fuck out of whatever earns people the most gold per hour so they can convert them to gems to buy keys/store items?
---
Because that's what "playing the game" means in current year GW2.
---
i really like that they are atleast not leaving us in the dark for the next 3 months and giving us atleast an insight of the aftermath of the battle. Im really looking foward to what Caithe´s versionn will talk about since she and the commander where the ones closer to Aurene.
---
On a side note; Dick move Anet, i was starting to feel better and you remind me why i was down the last couple weeks. the 40 to 1:10 timeframe in this Spongebob video describes exactly how i felt, [https://youtu.be/lrZS8LvX1EE?t=40](https://youtu.be/lrZS8LvX1EE?t=40)  just replace Patrick with Anet coming in and saying "hey, here is what everyone else is feeling in the aftermath of Aurene´s death"
---
Given how long we have had the outfit system running it's obvious that the profit they get from these combined with the effort to make them compared to seperate armor pieces is a whole lot better for them 
---
I like this, it definitely captures the spirit of your character. Nice drawing!
---
Aesthetically? Yes.
---
As actual mobs in game? Meh.
---
They were neat from a lore and appearance perspective but they definitively fell into the "irritating to fight but give nothing worth the trouble" category that Anet loves to fill these days.
---
I'm not terribly cut up to see them gone just like I won't be when I don't have to fight joko zombies that auto generate protection when attacked at range anymore.
---
Wonderful work. Nice to see something simple and beautiful. Guild Wars 2 can get pretty tacky and comical with all the glowies and flashy things,  but this, I like this.
---
If only it was that easy to just split all the pieces of an outfit and not have the clip horribly with parts that arent that same outfit

---
This is probably the best one i've seen
---
I'd also like to see a Greatsword Engi spec. With all the chainsaw GS I just end up feeling weird using it anything that isn't a charr. Since the whole dieselpunk aesthetic goes well with them. Chainsaw's are my aesthetic though. Edgy or not I want to be a giant cat man running around pulling a doomguy.
---
While that is awesome and I'm super jealous of the skill there, I feel like it kind of loses the sadness. He just looks like angry old Rytlock.
---
Unless you’re min max parsing raids. 
---
Necro is probably one of the most viable and strongest pve professions in the game. 
---
Support scourge is near immortal and can constantly scoop people off the ground. Condition scourge nothing to scoff at either. 
---
Power reaper is insane in both open world and pvp. 
---
I like to run Valkyrie Hearn with wurm dunes on it. 
---
Core necro is also pretty powerful. 
---
The only thing is. Aside from support scourge, necro Is a selfish class. You aren’t buffing your allies and you’re not usually topping damage charts. But you’re also probably not dying and probably not relying on your allies to survive. 
---
We're not getting a new expansion anytime soon. After this season of living story ends we will go directly into the next season of living story.
---
To be a bit more accurate, the outfit wouldn't be a puzzle, but a photo. 
---
Each armor piece has it's own fixpoints. Arm pieces are fixated at the arms, chest pieces at the body etc. Just like a puzzle. 
---
But outfits have only one one fixpoint; to be more accurate only one piece that is fixated on the char and that's the whole outfit. 
---
So if you want to cut an outfit in pieces, you need to adapt your 3D model to the fixpoints, check if everything fits with other armor skins and so on. So you may have the 3D model, but all the other work is still left to do. 
---
Not only that, to already have the 3D model could also be bad. Because normaly you build your 3D model around those fixpoints, but now you have to have to change the 3D model, to fit the fixpoints, character and also other armor pieces. So in the end, you would end up with a different looking skin.
---
And of course this affects not only every race/gender, but also every armor weight. So you don't adjust your skins to all races/genders again, but also you now have 3 different armor weights. 
---
Reason behind this is that all 3 armor weights have different fixpoints. You can't take an light armor piece and put it on a heavy armor fixpoint. 
---
In the early days there were a preview bug, that allowed you to mix the different armor weights. The result was a clipping way beyond the worst you can see ingame. The whole character model were streched, compressed and bended in horrendous ways.
---
You see, the 3D model is only a part of the whole work and you can't just cut an outfit into pieces and it's done. 
---
Even if you have an armor set, that looks exactly the same on every weight, you still have the threefold work, because of the fixpoints. That's why armor sets take around 9 months to create and outfits way less.
---
No. You will get the same disappointment from just the free to play. 
---
Every fan elite of any class that cant bow yet is getting a bow. Its either bow or greatsword for some reason.
---
&gt;	Fun fact: one of the Silverwastes objects mentioned a “New Kryta” colony that the bandits/White Mantle were establishing in the northern Maguuma. Sadly, that’s the only mention of such.
---
Bloodstone Fen?
---
Elementalist will not get an elite spec weapon it can already conjure, like the frost bow. Elementalists use light weapons. I see pistol as the most likely option.
---
That and the sheer amount of currently available skins all look pretty much the same for female characters. There mostly pants with skirts over them and jackets with lots of hanging fabric. Sure the detail is different or the length but a good 3/4 of all female gear is the same. I love there art direction but maaan it gets old looking the same I did day 1 of the game coming out and today minus dyes. 
---
I would love to join in on the HP train for my new holosmith. I live in GMT+8 timezone, so which day and what time is compatible to join the train?
---
I'd like Engineer to have a magnetic axe they throw and always returns back to them, like a boomerang.
---
Nice try, I hope the people over at /r/gw2exchange see your post and put you on the scammer list. 400g for something that get's sold daily for 600g...   
---
Just improve Tempest support. It doesn't make sense to have 2 support-oriented elite specs on one profession.
---
I've long since switched to outfits because there's nothing to get hyped about with armors. They've all but abandoned them. I've tried and seen all the hot looks. Most of my characters haven't seen a (subjective) improvement to their mix and match look in years. I remember when armors were released with the same frequency as outfits, but then y'all had to make your monkey's paw wish. Sure, we'll get new armor sets in game. Maybe 3 whole sets every 2-3 years. Enjoy!
---
Waaaait a second... that's your own edit xD Kudos to you for making that
---
But "don't care" means don't care at all and don't do anything against it. And to be honest, yes there are some armors and some combinations that clip very much and look bad, but all in all, the game have very few clipping. Most armors matching very well with other sets and most of the existing clipping issues are very little ones. 
---
We wouldn't have this, if nobody cares.
---
no it's not. it's iopish's
---
Thats the moment where everyone should take 5 min off. That helped me break through so many times.
---
agree with everything except auras, just because i don't want more clutter
---
Warrior mainhand pistol that has a cone shot, doing more damage in melee.
---
Ah, sorry, I am absolutely blind and read your comment on it as the top post. Mega oof.
---
just some rubble but theres aurene and his friends at the end: [https://imgur.com/a/9JbY5c6](https://imgur.com/a/9JbY5c6) 
---
Okay, but how does irrelevant information like this help anyone?
---
Fiery Greatsword and Frost Bow can already be conjures.
---
there is ALWAYS a spot where anet forgot an invisible wall, I think on that map it took me 10 minutes 
---
his fangs still need to be more spiky and longer.
---
Do HoT adventures daily. Find a handful of easy ones, learn them well from dulfy guides, and get gold on them every day. Easiest HoT exp.   
---
For PoF, tag along in HP trains if you see them, even if your character has maxed out the HPs. They give decent daily repeatable exp.  
---
And lastly do the raids that you CAN finish without the relevant masteries.
---
The old defiance system had many flaws but in some ways was much cooler than breakbars. Getting rid of Mai Trin's defiance stacks and hold back CC's to be able to pull her into the lightning field felt very rewarding.
---
I bought the dye actually haha.. not my first character 
---
I've been trying to get the griffin mount over with, and have nearly completed all the requirements but have been stuck having to do this event. The NPC has been stuck in the same spot for over 24 hours, I have submitted a support ticked about the issue but can't help but feel frustrated at how long it's been going on.
---
Not sure if it's important but this is on the Henge of Denravi server, I am not sure how the servers work on GW2 other than there being a megaserver. I attempted to be a guest on other servers (don't know if i did it properly), but the NPC was still in the same position.
---
I guess the question stands whether there is something that I can do to bypass this annoyance, first thought being that I could transfer to another server but had issues with that method. If nothing else let this be another source to reach out to the GW2 staff maybe.

\-Humble Player Desperate to Get off the Ground
---
Thank you!! This character actually reached lvl 80 recently but I still like drawing him in this outfit cus it's simple haha 
---
I had a problem like this once, physically reseating my graphics card fixed it in that instance
---
It hasn't been announced, so anywhere between this fall and never would be my guess.
---
Absolutely nothing you said is observable fact. Get fucking real.
---
Check right after the Dailys refresh and see if that resets it.
---
That looks very refreshing. Not a dirty charr engineer, not a grinning asura engineer, not a flashy overdressed human. Thanks for sharing!
---
So, it seems like you recently watched The Lion King.
---
Exactly.
---
Pretty much.
---
 You obviously never been headbutted by a Charr. That stuff hurts so bad you'll be completely paralyzed with pain for 3 whole seconds!
---
Your inability to comprehend =/= my necessity to "get fucking real".  I suggest you get your arse out of your post-modern, neo-marxist arse and get real yourself.
---
I honestly have no idea. Definitely not how devs push a certain design decision for which players vocally refuse to pay real money, while apologists scream "don't buy it if you don't like it (and shut up because your opinion annoys us)".
