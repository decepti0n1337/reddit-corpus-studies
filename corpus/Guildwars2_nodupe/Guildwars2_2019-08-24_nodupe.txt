What are guild updates besides guild halls for 100 Alex. All guild missions are still the same and only base game.

---
If you liked dungeon running, take a look at fractals and raids.
---
NA aside from reset on certain servers no longer draws that many players to lag it out. The t2 match last week had no queues on reset at all on all 3 servers. This is less than your typical NA prime weekday a few years ago. NA is thus relatively sheltered, they see almost less than half the amount of EU peak players.
---
And here I was looking forward to fighting a poultry elemental.
---
Raids sounds fun. I’ll have a hunt thru YT for guides so I don’t start as such a scrub.
---
Terrible.... play wow, everything works smooth and the gameplay itself... another level
---
Doing stuff we want. Ok you got me there. What did they do that we wanted? The mount? We did not want the mount. It was forced on us. 
---
The dessert border? We wanted a new map but not a map that lagged out totally and everything stopped for 20 min because of a PvE in the middle. And i mean you litterally lagged out and could not do shit. 
---

---
Or there was waypoints in the keeps and towers you owned that enemies could use. Or did you mean the fact that it took longer to run from Rampart to fire or air keep then it took for enemies to break in to both outer and inner and kill the boss and grab the keep without anyone being able to get there to defend. It is some what better today but fire keep still take roughly as long to run too and usually they are at inner or at lord by the time you reach it. 
---
Or the golem rush that bugged out. The living story 1 pve stuff, the steal skill weekend which could have been fun but bugged out so that some classes was on stereoids with no cool down, or the fact that most of our reward track is shit. The festival rewardtracks are total rubbish. 
---
Or that it took 6 years to fix garrison water gate, or the portable cannon that made months a living hell. Or links. You know the links that was suppose to be easy to remove if it did not work. It did not work, and they did not remove it even though it is breaking WvW appart. 
---
And when alliances comming they wont fix anything, because A-Net told us they wont fix night cap. Alliances will not be able to decide who is on your world only who are on the alliance. And as you likely know there are not many guilds left out there and even fewer that want to organize a wolrd, so at this point alliances will likely hurt more then it give us something so we have that to look forward too.
---
Which of those and other things i can't remember for now do you feel we asked for and should have been happy about?
---
Interested to see what the graph says for tonight's reset.
---

---
Receive -20% lag duration for 5 seconds after dodge.
---
Gain 0,00001% progress towards Alliances.
---
(Lasts 20 minutes).
---
I know exactly what you mean. It first really sunk in when I was using my raptor and I realised you don't come to a complete standstill when stopping, your raptor drags for a second to try and stop themselves, so instead you stop a few units ahead of where you let go of your W key, and it's complete with an animation for it too.
---
It really helps sell the feeling of mounts being actual entities instead of just a cosmetic movespeed upgrade like other MMOs make them out to be.
---
It would be nice is Anet broke up the T1 servers and spread out the population a bit. Maybe have more wvw servers or combine dead ones. Or just make it all random.
---
Just admit it. Devs planning something *special* with him

AT LEAST THEY ARE THE PEOPLE'S CHAMPION
---
The red line is bad:  it should be laying at the bottom.  This is the reset in North America today (which took place after my previous post).   
---
Well, dang.
---
Freezes as in your PC can't handle the fight? From what you're saying it doesn't sound like a connection problem. Have you tried repairing the game client?
---
Thanks for the answer, it's nice to see you here.
---
I recorded this video tonight on reset, in Gandara (EU), around 20:15 - 20:20 (GMT +2).  
---
Needless to say I don't know how you manage your data/graphs so excuse me if this is obvious, but it's 2AM here already so there's not enough people around to make it laggy. If you're around during the day while there are enough people, you'll probably be able to experience quite a bit of lag (not as bad as it was in the video, hopefully). It's been quite laggy (2-3 seconds delay) with only two big blobs fighting each other lately, so it's likely that you'll be able to experience that.
---
But again, thanks for answering. I just hope to see the day where the lag is completely gone from WvW, aside of some worse days here and day. I remember back then when you moved to AWS, for the first few weeks WvW felt really nice, there was no lag at all and the threeways were great.
---
&gt;  But then we configured them in a way that told our load balancer they were more powerful than they actually were which led to this problem.
---
Does this mean that the max player capacity of WvW maps was temporarily increased while the load balancer was misconfigured?
---
By the way, this also seems to happen in open world: Tequatl lately has been laggy (even during defense phases where people won't use as many skills).
---
Since everyone has collectively decided that Revenant needs to have greatsword next, I don't write about that. 
---
But what I want second most is for necromancers to get Hammer. Use it either as a melee condition weapon (which they don't have), or a mid to long range heavy aoe weapon similar to revenants (since necro only has staff for ranged aoe if any sort). And instead of getting a new shroud, let us use the default death shroud (I expect this is part of why they buffed it recently) and use life force to cast Orders, like the team buffs that required sacrificing life in gw1. 
---
But mostly I just want to be able to justify creating Sharur
---
So... beautiful people? It can stop there.
---
I'd bet a lot of money that they have already done so
---
cant wait to clap some casuals :D
---
Not what you're asking, but if you're planning on playing this game for more than a couple of weeks, just buy at least 1 expansion (preferably both), you're literally limiting your fun for 15 bucks otherwise, I may get downvoted for this, but gw2 is basically a game you buy to play, the free tag is just marketing.
---
How's something based on finite numbers subjective?
---
Actually I think this is played without the Effect LOD setting turned on? This option limits the effect details and over the years in WvW I barely saw someone play without it as it hits your performance quite hard and your screen becomes a cluster fuck as you can see here. Just google some other WvW videos to see the difference.

As a choya collector, I’d be severly deppressed if this wasn’t the big annoucement on the 30:th. If there’s no new choya then I’m quitting gw2 until they do. Choya is the masterrace, it’s superior than any other races. They have all the quality of all the races and they’re just tiny wobbly watermelon and now that I have your attention Arena net please fix ranked for next season I can’t take it there’s diamond players playing with gold and no one can stand it my health is deteriorating and my family got radiation sickness from me playing soloq like that aint suppose to happen it’s a video game they aren’t even playing it’s not a nuclear bomb please help us s10 fornite teamfight conquest.

Greatsword has been meta on Guardian power DPS since 2012.

Best places to park alts (2 lvl 80, 1 lvl 49) to log once a day?

I don't have LWS3 chapters 1, 4 and 5.
---
I hope they don'r bring back culling. That was so bad 2 zergs could run through each other without noticing the other.
---
You know that people are buying multiple passes, and still think adding some crafting stations and a bank would hurt the sells of these?
---
...and now I have a new build site to fall down into :) Thanks very much for that, this kind of thing helps me get back to basics a lot faster.
---
You shouldn't have to play the HoT content solo, since there are still plenty of people in the maps. Make sure you keep aware of the timers that let you know when zones will be the most busy. HoT centers around meta events that let you know when the big event in each zone is up.
---
If you're on a US server, I can help you get into HoT, I do a lot of tours for new and returning players, hit me up in game on Vayne.8563.
---
Then they should enjoy the satisfaction of figuring it out themselves.
---
To counter your devil's advocate - if you deduce this so simply, the creators should have perhaps planned for it no?
---
Is that better than destroying them?
---
Get mount from first mission in PoF (the new expansion) so you can explore HoT maps with ease.
---
Is that worth it or should I just destroy them?
---
I understand now, thanks for explaining, it makes sense now :)
---
Even though it’s been confirmed for *weeks* that the next installment will be a living world and not another expansion? We know what’s coming bud, we’re just not negative about it
---
Basically everything I wanted to know, thanks a bunch :)
---
You should let people choose what to enjoy themselves :)

---
thank you, will do some read now \^\^
---
considering "cultivated" herbs as ascended crafting materials, i'd bet on grow lamp as well. And I've already contacted SAND. They're running next week supposedly for t6 dtop
---
&gt;We don't judge
---
I do. My judgment is 10/10
---
is the new expansion getting a discount already or they still at a full price ? kindda tight on a budget now haha
---
This means there is technology to dye the weapons.
---
But if Anet made dyeable weapons SAB babies will probably explode.
---
For open world bosses and events in the core game you can play whatever on the core necro - it won't matter anyways in the zerg . 
---
If you get seriously into fractals and you happen to like them , invest time and gold in the core warrior .
---
Last but not least , have fun .
---
Well yes, they're lootboxes and they're gambling. I agree with that. But I don't agree with the automatic you shouldn't be them. There may be a cultural divide here, but in Australia there's an awful lot of gambling. Many people like the occasional flutter. It's like anything that's addictive reallly. Alcoholism ruins lives, but that doesn't mean people shouldn't occassionally have a beer.  Gambling ruins lives, but here in Australia, a lot of people bet every year on the Melbourne Cup. We call it the race that stops the nation.
---
If you're going to buy black lion keys, you should be aware it's gambling, and you definitely shouldn't do it if you have a problem with it. 
---
But I do buy black lion keys when they go on sale. I don't usually buy them when they're not on sale. I buy 25 because it's another activity that I enjoy occassionally.  I don't care what I get. I'm not looking for that big drop. I'm just having a bit of fun.
---
I'm a grown up. Don't tell me what I should and shouldn't buy.
---
I'm all for that . But honestly , this gets posted all the time, when there's a search function ,and probably a sticky. It's the epitome of a low effort post.
---
They have 50% off sales every now and then, but even at full price it’s cheaper than HoT was when it launched.
---
Was a bit surprised at how similar the setup is to mine. I guess I'm not doing it to badly then.
---
not the ERP I was thinking about when I clicked the link...

There is an achievment for doing all jp's. Doesn't include HoT &amp; PoF

---
You are really missing out in the exoerience without the expansions tho so id suggest you w8 around for a sale if you are interested they buy them on sale (they include the base game) also get lw for story to make sense if you care about that.
---
Base game is in a limited f2p model so you can try it to get the early impressions.
---
I difference, the difference in it's vertical movement is miniscule, it's almost no difference. The thing that really sets skyscale apart though is afking.
---
Sure it looks cooler than a springer, but the in terms of use, being able to afk without concern for getting killed or knocked off your mount is it's draw card. It's basically perma invuln for afkers.
---
Yeah there's *dozens* of us :)
---
Yeah I mean if this game ends up being what I think it is buying expansions won’t even be a question. But I assume the base game gives me enough of a taste to see if I’ll like it right? It’ll have a few raids maybe a world boss or two? Or is some stuff exclusive to the expansions?
---
I never bought any of them because they are so ultra-niche. I got the Snow Owl one and for a while I though I'd got a hearing problem because it makes a loud screech when it visits.
---
I guess of all the customisations I expected; mail carriers didn't even appear on the radar because they're used so infrequently.
---
That's not a solution because the bug is tied to the user's system.  When I had no skins I would get the bug when I played on a shit 10 year old computer but not on our new gaming pc.  Also, having now bought mount skins, the person in our house using the shitty computer still has the mount bug happen from time to time regardless of skinned or not. We've never experienced it on our new system.
---
It's still criminal he's barely got any patrons on Patreon developing this for us.

Linking it again to get this dude some more support
---
Raids and some maps locked behind the expansions, amongst other things like mounts.
---
Yep it can be fun if we've to use monts or maybe the new things will comming 🙄
---
Hmmm well that sucks. But then the base game used to be the entire game. At one point people bought what is today the base game before there were ever expansions and if I understand right it was a smash hit. So it sucks some things are locked behind expansions but I imagine there’s still enough fun content to keep me going.

World bosses for sure, raids we didnt have pre hot (first expac) so they are tied to expansions, fractals tho 5man u have acess to all of it (lvl80 tho) and dungeons for lvl80 and earlier.
---
Expansions added stuff like gliders, mounts and elite specs which are basically diff specialisations for each class.
---
Try abit of base for a while and then buy one of the expacs (i suggest pof for entry expac) if you find it on sale and like it.
---
Hmm ok noted. I assume since hot was the first expansion I should get that one first? Or are the expansions in no particular order? I don’t want to get them out of order and then be confused because I did that.
---
THIS CHOYA IS FOOKING ROOOAAAAAW!
---
You may want to reread this thread.
---
It wouldn't make sense to allow F2P people access to all endgame instanced content. 
---
You already have access to dungeons and fractals (upgraded dungeons). Adding raids would just diminish their exclusivity and give some people no reason to buy expansions if instanced content is all they want.
---
I can't think of an MMO that has raids in their free trial model.
---
Lately, playing from AU with 300+ms ping I can see, head towards and just about reach another player before the team colour tag appears above their head telling me if they are an enemy or not (sans targetting them).
---
It never used to be that bad.  Happens with yellow text items also.
---
There are some good core builds around. Check metabattle and godsofpvp for info on builds and the game mode.
---
Indeed, don't.
---
Anet makes most of their money from the chinese client. They dont care anymore.
---
Fixed, thanks
---
I farm Dragonfall. Always find a commander who knows what they're doing, though.
---
You joke but it's true. Us Kaineng folks always used lag to predict enemy movement.
---
Yeah, what we been saying on the official forums for years. This started with the removal of condition caps in WvW. It got worse with the move to AWS. And then worse again with mounts.
---
Out of all the professions, thief and guardian are still viable without expansions, to the point that it's not unreasonable.
---
WvW was by far my favorite gamemode when I played. But after logging in recently to try it again... yeah, no. I like to keep my rubberbands in my drawer, not my games, thanks.
---
Go back on the different forums and read again the serious posts. I'm not talking about some player rants, I'm talking about detailed descriptions of major bugs or skill imbalances.  
---
Without even going to major fuck-ups like the introduction of the desert map, most of the anger of the WvW community comes from the facts that aNet spent time and energy to introduce some stuff they self-branded a huge QoL improvement (ex: gliding, mounts, etc...) but never bothered to fix real issues that were leading to exploits or real imbalance.
---
We are not saying we are against changes, we are saying that we want aNet to fix the issues that have been pointed out for years before going for more trivial stuff.
---
To illustrate my point here is something that is for me the best example: the perma-stealth trap thief. That build has been reported for several years by everybody as totally broken and nothing was done until someone used it to solo a PvE raid boss and then it was fixed within weeks.
---
Sure there is toxicity among the WvW (it's a competitive game mode so it should hardly be a surprise) but the huge percentage of our complains have been around for years and are about real issues: fix them and you'll find a less grumpy community...
---
Yep this is indeed correct
---
Well, if they are not boxes and you get random items killing enemy's, we can complaint about loot boxes. Anet is genius!
---
I play in the EU, the last few weeks lags in big fights have been terrible. The situation got a little better last night.
---
But still, in some big battles, lags appeared.
---
People on the map also complained about this problem. Seafarer's Rest server, Eternal Battlegrounds map.
---
really? i don't like taylor swift but i still know of her from the news (gotta fulfil their quota of trashy celebrity "news"). i also didn't watch teapot but i heard of him from around or before the first ERP tournament
---
"lag" is a valid callout on FA.
---
Ah... that explains it. I don't really watch any streams and I've never had any contact with Twitch or anything.
---
As somebody who came to this game from World of Warcraft, honestly I’m pretty content with the level of server lag. It reminds me of that saying where to make your head feel better, hit it against the wall for a while because you’ll be relieved when you stop.

---
Your mileage will vary greatly depending on what you'll like. For comparison i've played for 1145 hours in the past year and a half, which are rookie numbers in mmo. I feel like I've barely scratched the surface. There's content to keep me occupied for years.
---
Yeah, I have too which is why I'm confused. I woke up early to play from the start but the servers were broken so it got delayed a couple hours, we listened to Gangnam Style, it was great xD
---
he's also running an event right now and the thread posted by him is on the front page lol
---
The face of gift acceptance.
---
Lmao if someone lacks the hardware to play the game then that's on them, and there is no jumping puzzle that requires you to have graphics above min settings anyways. It's completely fine to add jumping puzzle requirements to something like a legendary weapon depending on how it's done. I think it's time for content to stop being tailored to the demands of the people who refuse to get good. Especially legendary weapons.
---
So... inquest chairs then?
---
Yeah. I use the ScallyWag Chest on my warrior and it pinches so, so bad. Plus it completely warps the armour around the arm. Some of my other heavy armour charr don't look as bad because the shoulder armour hides some of it, but geez.
---
Asura also look less than great since their arm seems to be too far back in an attempt to prevent ear clipping.
---
Awesome! Thank you
---
Surprised they haven't added some more.
---
But then again their are lots of things they've abandoned for no good reason.
---
Asura almost have a martial arts or dancing pose... that has been turned into torture as each limb is being pulled in a different direction.
---
Draconis mons JP, abandons descent JP, sharkmaw JP (low lvl char for silver doubloon), jackal tomb mini adventure..
---
My Sylvari looks like she has a bit of a lazy eye going on with the rock.  Also the shoulder clipping, oh boy.  
---
Still cool I guess if you want to show off your weapons.
---
No, its objective. That's a ridiculous way to look at it.
---
"SOMEONE likes it so it must he good." Do you even hear yourself? That's beyond stupid.
---
Look at the patch notes from last year to
---
today. In almost every single one there's a mesmer nerf.
---
Even if we ignore the major stuff like the phantasms, it all added up and the class has been stripped completely naked because Anet doesn't know what the fuck their doing and the feedback they get is your braindead thought process of everything is fine no matter what and the PvP brainlets that are constantly crying about Mesmers being too OP.
---
But sure, the class is fine because SOMEONE in the world likes it.
---
What an idiot....
---
How the heck did you play with so many UI? Feels so cramped. And the meter doesnt seem to be necessary on WvW.

Oh god. It's not so bad if you have shoulder armour showing, at least.
---
New content every 2-4 months *so far*, the devs are going to shake shit up in the next weeks. Everyone is waiting for the big reveal.
---
Amount wise people already told you everything from months to years. You're best off if you're a completionist, and worst off if you only do instanced content and nothing else. Best case, you're going to be busy gathering achievements, skins, weapons and whatnot for the next few years. Worst case you rush by literally everything and do nothing but raids, in which case you might be done in six months or less, depending on your raid group / raid training guild / personal performance, etc.
---
Also keep in mind that GW2 is seven years old. Early story instances and present story instances do not compare in any way. Presentation, technology, difficulty - two different worlds. Working your way through all of them you'll get to see the game's progress in in time-lapse.
---
So no scroll ;&lt; Good thing I hoarded all of the 60 ones. I understand why they don't want to go past 60 but they could throw this one again there.

Health for elementalist?? I have full zerker gear and my health is super low and I’m curious if I should build vitality/toughness for one of my ascended gears. I run a lot of fractals and I do a lot of pve.

---
I play on my laptop, have since release. Lol. Check canyourunit.com

Correcting your correction: The Mists don't "just" connect worlds/universes. Other worlds are *inside* of the Mists. It's not even known if these other worlds are inside of the same universe as Tyria (like other planets) or inside of other universes or are elswhere. However it's known that the Underworlds as well as the Fissure of Woe are own placed inside of the Mists. 
---
Also humans *didn't* come from another planet. A planet is never mentioned. It's only said that the gods brought humans from "elswhere".

But the molten boss fractal is from lws1. :| So is Mai Trin. The only things missing are the Watchwork Boss from Lornar's Pass and Scarlet's Invasion of Lion's Arch.

Whats the point of that? Can he buy something with votes? Is it such an accomplishment?

Might want to increase the memory but the rest looks fine unless you plan to participate in WvW lagfests. Make sure that you have sufficient cooling.

Can't complain about skill balance if you can't use your skills!

---
A small cooling pad - laptop stand should help with cooling. When I was playing gw2 on my laptop it was definitely worth the approximately 20€.
---
Without specifics, you post is underwhelming.  We have not idea what you're considering a bug.  It could be clipping armor, invisible walls, or other items of very little importance.

Stat selectable gear doesnt show its stat or prefix when linked, so maybe that was it?

Oh, maybe. I didn't think it was stat select gear, but it could have been. Have to go back and check. Thanks for the heads up.

I think that's a question for future me.

Ah it is? Per character I guess? I never even thought about it because I wouldn't bear to grind for all those hours... But, can't you do that with alts? I'm just saying, isn't there a way to farm all day if you want to?

Oh, right, I forgot about those after i got the three good ones.

I mean, it's *chef*. It costs like 2g to level on another character, and discovery exp is per-character.

I sometimes play on i5 8250u, gtx 1050, 8gb ram. The CPU is the bottleneck for me at 1080p, so throttlestop + some aggressive fan speeds makes it more enjoyable so I can constantly hit 60fps in most low-medium scenarios.

i have the anniversary dragon one.  i forget about it every time because the animation always plays when I'm in the trading post menu, and i just hear the sound and see the fading wisps of it once i x out.  the "message received" one is even less noticable.
---
there IS somethig that can do it but its kind of a work in progress. I think they call it hive servers iirc. but basically the idea is you have multiple phyical servers to handle one instance of a game server.  
---
.
---
so they share the load by breaking it into sections, basically how the maps in wvw are broken up into little sections that you "claim" and then you can glide in. only each of those sections would be handled by a phyical server. then if one sever (map area) gets overwhelmed or crashes, the other servers will pick up the slack.   
---
Here is a youtube video of a game being developed on one of these servers called Dual Universe. they were able to get 30,000 simulated clients into a single instance without losing stability. granted these are just bots who walk around not spamming skills and trying to jump into keeps, but 30,000.. come on.   
---

Was sarcasm, EU is the same and struggled to put teams together too without merging.
---
Sounds interesting, but how would you prevent trolling? A line of people standing to block a gate, etc?
---
Watch it now get disabled in wvw, to keep it in line with other items.
---
You might be right. Or maybe, maybe that's what they want us to believe. I can't find my tinfoil.
---
Nope, elementalist is meant to be high risk high reward
---
Stacking vitality or toughness would either be wasted, or you'd be losing out on a lot of damage overall.
---
An option you can use it to use maurader's gear, since that's slightly lower damage than pure berserker, but it does provide some vitality. In general though, you just have to learn to deal with the elementalist getting killed by a gentle breeze
---
My best dps on power dh on golem is 27k at best (without food). What am I doing wrong?
---
* I make no mistakes in the rotation
---
* I press the skills as fast as possible, spamming the button right before its cooldown ends.
---
* I have all normal boons, spotter, frost/sun spirit and warrior buffs.
---
* I always set 25 stacks of vulnerability on golem.
---
I really don't understand what I am doing wrong. Even with food, my dps wouln't even reach 30k, while the benchmark is 33k. With power quickbrand I can reach benchmark, while with dh I am still very far from it.
---
Should I start blaming the crappy laptop, my connection, or am I doing something wrong?

&gt; When you designed the event Champion rush, it should have been clear that people will play the content and that the populartiy of chamption trains in Keshex hill, Cursed Shore and Frostgorge Sound would raise in popularity.

To be fair, Champion Rush gives you a good incentive to adapt a playstyle which counters diminishing returns. Just have your train hop on different maps regularly, problem solved.

&gt; when researching it was because it is CPU bound and optimized for Intel not AMD. Now move to a GPU bound (or Hybrid) system and my FPS would have shot up to where it is at in other MMORPGs.
---
Yeah that's not how this works. All MMOs are CPU-hungry, simply because of the enormous amounts of GPU draw calls that have to be made in crowded situations. DX12 offers a solution for that, by allowing more than one CPU thread to be used for making those, but that doesn't mean less overall CPU pressure — in fact, it goes up a little I believe.

This is a good point a lot of people probably don't pay attention to.  If gems spike up 25% in conversion and the sale is for 30% off, you're only really getting 5% off the normal price.  Its still a "deal" but its not as good as it appears.

Nice video! This mount is so much fun, same as beetle. GW2 is the only game I know with mounts who ppl can have fun with. In any other games they can only run fast or fly without dash or diving.

The server lag is getting worse. I've been experiencing it during Tequatl fight for the past two weeks. Around a week ago, it toned down a bit, but still the lag exists. Yesterday, the WvW started lagging just the same. Had bad lag spikes, after a while it worked fine again.
---
I am pretty sure it isnt from my side cause i have discord running in the background which i can easily check the latency from. Not to mention i directly ask in chat and i get many replies of people lagging likewise.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bitterfrost_Vantage_Point

I prefer it during daytime. Almost looks branded at night. (Though the day-night cycle in Bitterfrost Frontier is tied to the meta event, and is much shorter than other maps).
---

Nope, get hit or have a condition on you and you go down.

So it is going to be 100 power, 70 fero, +5% damage when wiggling?

I thought it was going to be tomorrow too! I still have the character I created one minute after the headstart started so I was expecting to do it tomorrow before work but just checked here and saw people were getting them today
---
No.
---
What I'm saying is that they do not want people using bots, and players acting like bots.
---
Even in Silverwastes farms the repetition won't be the same as players have to do events and the meta for the magic find bonuses and to get keys. And It's even less in living world maps like Istan and Dragonfall, which goes on a cycle and players are free to participate however they want between metas. 
---
Running in circles between champion events is easily doable by bots,  and it's a core map available to free accounts, so it'll get hit harder by diminishing returns.
---
Noice.

The architecture in the background made me think it was at Thunderhead Peaks, but I checked there and there isn't anything like that over there. Can't think of any other place either

If you're encountering a Mirage, be aware that you might be fighting a clone and the actual player might be either stealthing or standing in a location that isn't obvious, or is harder to find.

This isn't hacking.

You need to show some video proof, or this is a serious but false accusation.

I mean, we got a mount now in wvw that is more OP than literally being a sitting duck with regards to the chair. May as well give us our dang chairs.

I'm actually a bit pissed at the lack of a lvl70 scroll. Even if it's just another lvl60 one. I wanted to use them on another row of key farmers, and now I got nothing. Gah.
---
At this point I really don't care if those changes are gonna make WvW better or worse. I'd like to see **any** meaningful changes.
---
Not warclaw, not gliding. Terrain changes, new siege &amp; siege balance, some new mechanics, new tactivators, anything to spice up the gameplay. At this point I could probably run from any enemy spawn to north camp on alpine, tagging garri on the way without getting marked by sentry or watchtower, with my eyes closed.

Delta has said that build templates are in maintenance only from now on. No new features. The 1st party build templates are coming soon, and then Arc's build templates will be disabled.
---

---
Yep, it is called realism which the modern snowflakes, and their safespaces, shy away from.
---
&gt; My Unidentified Gear (blue, green, &amp; yellow) are all inside the  invisible bag so that I do not accidentally "Salvage All" them. 
---
Just to add to this, it's a good idea to always keep 1 of each colour in the bag. So you split the stack but only leave 1 in the invisible bag and put the rest into the normal bags when you open all. That way you don't have to worry about forgetting or always having to put unidentified gear back into the invisible bags.  
---
My method isn't all that different, I think most vets by now have realised the value of having at least 1 invisible bag to keep static items. I didn't know that 2H trick though, it always annoyed me when switching from 2 x 1h weapons to GS or Staff and 1 of the 1h always ended up in my top bag. Still gives me a mini heart attack when I do that and 1 item "vanishes" lol
---
That's the Victorious Dye Kit! :)
---
All I know is that DX12 allows more FPS with all others being equal.  I also know that I am not running around with a blob on my screeen (due to having to reduce the quality so low in GW2) for graphics and max settings and in a raid getting 2x as many FPS than the blobby GW2.  Iow they arevery playable while GW2 was not.  Now solo GW2 ran fine but solo I get 100+ fps in games like ESO or Neverwinter but in GW2 I got 40-60 and the graphics was as far down as I could get them.  Just all around bad.
---
The [announcement on the 30th](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/join-us-for-a-special-live-event-on-august-30/) is about season 5 of living story. We may get other info as well but that isn't likely. Assuming season 5 follows the same pattern as the last few  we can expect 6 new episodes releasing one every 2-4 months. There should be a sale coming up so I'd wait for that.
---
Oooo you gave mr such an amazing gemstore idea! Anet could sell mastery points!
---
You can type /wiki and shift+click an item, the game will send you to appropriate page.
---
nah they will probably make it the main selling point on august 30 thinking that will be enough. but if they say also elite specs are coming then im gonna be happy. short term fix though, you'll need content to play those elite specs - new repeatable dungeon in each new living story map would do
---
What dye kits are in the 7th birthday present?
---
Even better, sell a diploma reading "I enjoyed Gw2" and block your account for being too good at the game.
---
He's saying he picked the same armour weight as he picked last year. So by looking, you check whether you already have it or not. Support could probably fix it for him but honestly...
---
It's ridiculous that you're allowed to pick the same weight twice, and it's ridiculous that someone would be stupid enough not to check.
---
U mAd bRuh?
---
Okay so the last LS chapter the only significant things that came from it for the majority were new story and a new mount. The new mount took longer than 2 hours to acquire but it was timegated and there was no difficulty aspect to it, just a bunch of fetch quests (and literally just playing fetch with aurene lol). The story itself takes 2 hours at most to do. Not everyone cares about getting the skyscale, because not everyone has interest in farming timegated map currencies from ls3 and ls4. I had them already so I didn't have to sit around waiting as long. This is not what I'd call content to keep someone busy with. Even if you include skyscale collections, it took me 3 days before I was finished with it and boom no reason to revisit that map anymore. No new dungeons to do or anything, just old festivals with the same achievements and rewards I finished years ago for the next half a year.
---
sadly my 1st char was deleted by my cousin, and looks like Anet support can't do nothing about it... :(
---
what store?? you mean merchants or trading post? can you explain a bit?
---
The same reason why every bit of content isn't catered to 5khours+ players that want more of a challenge is why people that unfortunately suffer from disabilities can't complete everything. There are minimum requirements for your hardware, and I've been able to complete most content with some super shitty laptops. Maybe it took longer, but I got there. Just the fact that portals are NOT disabled in jp areas means that anet do care about their playerbase enough to allow people to not need to engage with the content to get the rewards.
---
Also all of the essential mounts were launched with PoF and made acquirable with a simple gold sink, the griffon, roller beetle and the skyscape offer cool new ways of movement, but don't lock any exploration off the player, with the exception of some PoIs in the domain of kourna I believe.
---
I see the same Ele now every day. He teleports from node to node under the map and spams skill on the people that are above the ground. Super annoying and instant lose.
---
Haha, okay, fair enough. Thanks.
---
It's lovely when I play Weaver or Firebrand on bvbvb that I am so scared to either ruin my Meteor Shower combo or weapon swap my tomes unintentionally. 
---
I feel like the server is dying, not even 111111 works. I can literally stand in all red AoEs and my HP won't go down because enemies can't DPS either.
---
"Can't heal/DPS from too much feature."
---
It should boost power more the closer the buff is to expiring
---
Repeat after me; I do not buy RNG Loot Boxes.
---
Depends on the wvw meta honestly, there have been plenty of times in the past where cele guard/necro were meta
---
Best way for me to have my inventory clean is to have the bags actually shown. That way I have a clean line every 32 slots. I really can’t work with one massive inventory.
---
You can get materials that you’ll need for crafting legendaries or ascended or you can just sell for decent profit
---
Not only that but it also seems quite biased toward EU guilds. Sure they may be better but you could argue that the majority of NA wvw don't know who most of those guilds are and therefore they are not famous, in a video about famous guilds you probably would have done better including the very old and large guilds that shaped NA, yes believe it or not there are more old fight guilds other than TW.  Until then maybe change the title of your video to "best gvg guilds" instead of lying and saying "famous wvw guilds".
---
Depends if you are planning on your fight lasting under 10 seconds or so. Personally I worry more about the players I can't kill in under 10 seconds when roaming - they are the good ones.
---
30 minutes is all the time some people have for the game in the first place and if you're following a train chances are you've seen every champion on that map at least once as it is. Go to a different map. That's the point to avoid the monotomy of seeing the same things over and over again.
---
That's brilliant.
---
Mawma this is art.
---
Remember how many people used writs?
---
Well, tiny fraction of that number might use one of those feasts. Once.
---
Such a waste of an update.
---
Meh, we don't even know when official templates will come. Probably not until we got a full set of legendary trinkets.
---
What's the last backpack ya'll are missing? It's the human one for me, looks kinda goofy and so I can't make it fit on any of my edgy characters
---
why would they do that? then you want to wait also legendary infusions and legendary food? they're not gonna hold them off another 4 years just because some parts are missing.
---
&gt;  I would hate to invest my time and money in a game that won't be supported anymore. Any guesses?
---
Personally I think we've got at least another year and a half of new stuff to come before it goes into maintenance mode. There is also an *exhaustive* amount of already-there stuff to play.
---
There is a theory that their build templates will only work with legendary items. 
---
Even though it's unlikely, because literally everybody would rage about it, it still could be the first step. Legendary only fist, but including everything in later updates. 
---
Legendary stuff are just the easiest to work with. You can change builds without switching an piece of equipment. And to make it usefull in any situation you only have to switch weapons.
---
Sure, in the end it's speculation, but it's not unfounded.
---
Strangely, last night during world bosses many people were noticing skill lag (a few seconds, not as bad as WvW).
---
My laptop runs it comfortably with a ryzen 5 and 8gb of ram. You should be fine.
---
ascended food? what did i miss
---
I was hoping an answer like "what is an healbrand in fractals?" :(
---
I want "A bowl of Infinite Chicken Soup" Not, as you might think, a Limitless supply of Chicken soup as in a feast. No no, its a single serving meal, but made from "the Infinite Chicken" an abomination of science and nature. Poultry that exists in 7 spacial and 4 temporal dimensions.

---

---
Thank all of you for the good info. I'll wait a bit for the sale and will continue my journey. Having fun so far!
---
The max level for cooking is being raised to 500.
---
Not only that, backpacks don't disappear while on the rock. (They do disappear when using emotes though)
---
Was that the same guy that sold home instances? If yes then this could be a difference
---
I judge and the judgement is good.
---
the reasoning dornsinger gave... last week or so in a thread, is that the LFG is supposed to be used to form groups with the purpose of clearing content. the home instance is not clearable content, but rather just offering of goods - sold or given freely - by their logic, and as such providing it via LFG is against this pointless rule.
---
no conflicting comments, its not allowed to advertize your group in LFG for selling home instance entry but looking for people to join your home instance free of charge is absolutely fine.
---
Casuals don't watch people play on twitch, they only play themselves.
---
The lag is steadily decreasing because as is the size of groups running. It’s directly correlated to the size of groups, as well as how many servers are fighting at once. 2 servers isn’t the worst depending on their size. 3 servers is very bad. Mildly playable if you can play around your 5-7second input lag. 3 servers, one of them being BG (BG always makes everyone lag more, unsure why) and if its at SMC? It’s truly unplayable. I have been on seventeen servers across NA and EU, and the higher tiers with a bigger population have always had more lag. 
---
Some lag factors:
---
• How many people are there
---
• How many servers are there
---
• What skills are being used (groups standing     staring at eachother doesn’t cause lag like fighting, but thats pretty obvious)
---
• What map you’re on (EBG is absolutely worst)
---
• Where on map you are (SMC on reset night is a death sentence)
---
I would suggest going to a T1 server on EBG next week and witnessing a 3 way fight in SMC if you’re able. They are not extremely likely anymore as the lag is so intense it’s not the best place for fighting, but they do happen. I have been told that the three way fighting works off a “priority system” where one server gets to use skills for 5-10s as the netcode didn’t exist for much else,  but I am unsure of the validity of that. However, I know the engine is 15 years old so it’s not as simple as flipping a switch to fix this lag. Thanks for looking in to it. If you have any questions about WvW, the community is literally begging for help and will appreciate (mostly) anything it’s given. It’s the only reason I log in to GW2, and the community is where I feel at home. I’m hoping it lasts long enough for this lag to be fixed. Thanks again.

They are testing the new profession : living statue
---
Would be cool if those monkeys at anet created clear rules instead of banning players fo doing things that are being done by others for years.
---
Anom, too. Anom is so bad sometimes that my game will lock up for seconds at a time, or I’ll get stuck in one place even though my movement animations are going.
---
no idea
---
Hahahaha. How stupid do you have to be to take that list seriously?
---
It's claiming that "may be" is a synonym of "doubtless". Holy shit, even a retarded monkey understands that's obviously not correct. For the record, those definitions are provided by the free knock-off lexico.com, the provider of the English dictionary for Oxford Online Dictionaries, **not** the real Oxford English Dictionary (OED). OED isn't available for free. I've consulted my OED, and it makes absolutely no such claim (again, obviously).

the way dragonfall handles this is entirely different and shouldn't be compared to DR at all.. the chest cap can't be reached in 20min(DR totally can) unless you jump maps like crazy! also i don't recall you stop getting keys after a number of events so you can just stockpile them(you can't stockpile champ trains btw)
---
&gt; Riba is a long complicated meta that needs a lot of people to coordinate to be effective
---
now you're just making up bullshit excuses for something that was brought up multiple times in the past and never truly answered
---
Six guilds? I have a feeling Anet won't be impressed haha
---
Use them for your weekly key farm, you can combine these with tomes to get to level 64 and get a free sigil of nullification, plus some boosts along the way. It also helps clear up clutter in your bank.
---
This was already proven bullshit with Silverwastes/Tarir ML/Istan.
---
Downvote squad...OBLITERATE.
---
Isn't the Nullification sigil a story reward?
---
And the next thread will come in one minute, saying "30 minutes until stream"? 
---
And the next one in 15 minutes saying "15 minutes until stream"? 
---
That's annoying AND against the rules...
---
Wish anet supported at least half of that number game modes.
---
&gt;It's about the rules of this subreddit.
---
You're the type of guy to remind the teacher to collect the homework at the end of class
---
Will do then, thanks :)

TRUE

Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?
---
Due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator+subreddit%3Aguildwars2&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
I didn't downvote anything, so what exactly is your problem?
---
not like anything else is happening on this subreddit anyway
---
Weaver, mirage and daredevil.
---
Good luck fighting that.
---
It's one of a choice of 3 you get when you hit level 64. I used up lots of tomes/scrolls to get them when they were super pricey on the TP when everyone was doing the Requiem armor collection.

Oof

---
Not true by the way.
---
If some dumbasses annoy me and I know they didn't do their homework, maybe. 
---
However, to argue it's okay to break the rules, just because what's done is "cool" is pretty idiotic. That's the dumbest argument ever. 
---
There are ways to follow the rules, it's not like this is "the only way".
---
If you don't like it dont read it 4head

you have to reequip them quickly
---
why weaver? i would say scourge would be better for corrupt spam
---
Sicc evade spam. You don't need to corrupt if you can just damage and not be hit.
---
Nice guide :)
---
And im glad GW2 had deposite all mats option, imagine you must go back to Banker to store mats everytime for peeps who dont have perma contract, also i hope someday ANet will add standalone ui or keybind for that.
---
he is almost gone bois!
---
Sad :/
---
Yes, sorry, I wasn’t very clear. I have a character slot that I use for a weekly key farm, and I use the boosts for that.
---
Weird, I don't see any of that. Maybe step out of your delusional bubble for once ?
---
very wrong, they directly said you cant invite people for free to home instance using LFG, but you actually can sell home instance using map chat
---
It would also be cool that the monkeys that play the game wouldn't go out of their way to push limits of the rules/exploit/bug abuse and of course most importantly whine...
---
tuning in now, and teapot is presenting his amazing video for wing 3.  The great camera angles etc, making this game look great.

We know from story and open world dialogue that Elder Dragos trap the souls of some of the corrupted people into their now-elemental minion bodies (except for the regular Mordrem and Destroyers since those two are not created by corrupting people), and the affected souls will remain trapped until their corrupted corporeal shell is destroyed. For example, we can hear this being discussed in the [Mist Warden Camp](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mist_Warden_Camp#Ambient_dialogue) in Dragonfall:
---
&gt; **Mist Warden Ranger:** I'm saying that if I'd been Branded, I wouldn't have let the Crystal Dragon control me like that. He's strong. I'm stronger.  
---
&gt; **Mist Warden Spellbreaker:** It's not that simple. When you're Branded, you take up arms against the ones you love. You can't resist.  
---
&gt; **Mist Warden Ranger:** I could. Hardly a warrior's death—serving as your enemy's puppet.  
---
&gt; **Mist Warden Spellbreaker:** It's why I became a Mist Warden. To maybe...stop someone else from having to do what I did. To suffer as I do.  
---
&gt; **Mist Warden Ranger:** You were Branded?  
---
&gt; **Mist Warden Spellbreaker:** Trapped in a body I couldn't control. For years. The Pact finally freed me. Now, here I am.  
---
It's likely that both Tybalt and Forgal were slain and then corrupted into Risen by Blightghast although we never faced them in battle as far as we know. Even the Risen commander we can face in a triggered dynamic event in Sparkfly Fen seems to just be a random Risen taunting us about the mentors' deaths rather than being the corrupted mentor as we never see a Risen sylvari commander but another random Risen taunting us about Sieran due to sylvari being immune to dragon corruption thanks to the protection from the Dream/Nightmare (despite Taimi and Canach's claims that sylvari can't be corrupted due to being dragon minions already when we know from Subject Alpha and Beta that crosscorruption is possible for existing dragon minions). Once their Risen shells have been slain, the spirits of Forgal and Tybalt can be free to disperse into the Mists. If their spirits weren't trapped in the Risen bodies to begin with, they were shown to have come to terms with sacrificing themselves for the greater good, so they would not end up in the Domain of the Lost but in their designated racial afterlives.
---
However, for whatever unclear reason not every spirit ends up trapped in their corrupted body. In Mount Maelstrom we encounter the ghost of [Crusader Aliyana](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crusader_Aliyana) who has this to say:
---
&gt; **Aliyana:** Oh don't mind me, I'm just remembering my horrific death.  
---
&gt; **Player:** I sense a story coming.  
---
&gt; **Aliyana:** My unit and I were sent here to abate the incoming Risen forces, but I caught a chill the night before our big battle. I stayed behind while my unit went on to fight the enemy.  
---
&gt; **Player:** What happened next?  
---
&gt; **Aliyana:** My unit fell, becoming the enemy we were sent to fight. And worse, they found me, still with fever, and tore me apart. Now my corrupted body fights for Zhaitan.  
---
&gt; **Player:** I found this on a risen nearby. Was it yours? (With Aliyana's Locket in inventory)  
---
&gt; **Aliyana:** I was wearing that when I died! Thank you for recovering it. It gives me peace to know that Zhaitan will no longer be using my body to carry out his evil.  
---
Zhaitan also had the uncanny and so far unexplained ability to somehow pull souls of long-dead people from the safety of Mists to inhabit some of his stronger Risen minions as can be seen with the Eyes of Zhaitan and the Keeper of the Shrine which inhabited the souls of Orrian royals and a priest of Grenth, respectively. According to the seventh Reaper, Grenth was supposedly mighty pissed about Zhaitan taking his devoted from him, so the Reaper demanded we slay the corrupted Keeper to return his soul back to Grenth's grace in the ["Cathedral of Silence"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cathedral_of_Silence_\(story\)) instance. Interestingly enough Zhaitan was also able to do this to Mazdak the Accursed, an Orrian prince who had left to colonize Kryta and was buried there rather than with the royals in Orr. Unlike most Risen, Mazdak's spirit was somehow turned to evil and he returned as a powerful, nigh-unkillable lich instead, and oddly enough Zhaitan didn't care to corrupt the ghosts protecting Mazdak's tomb (and somehow the ghosts remained unaware of Mazdak's turn into Risen until the Valiant [informed them](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dead_of_Winter) of it):
---
&gt; **Player:** Hear me, ghost! Your master, Mazdak, has been corrupted by an ancient evil. We must pass.  
---
&gt; **Player:** We wish to end his blight, but this enchanted door blocks our path. Will you help us, protector?  
---
&gt; **Captain Bragen:** Corrupted? By what foul force? Speak truth, interloper, or I will know!  
---
&gt; **Player:** By the Elder Dragon Zhaitan. He has stolen your lord's body, and turned his spirit to evil.  
---
&gt; **Captain Bragen:** This is dark news. Mazdak was once lord of these lands, serving the people and the Gods. To hear he has now become a servant of evil...  
---
Curiously Mordremoth had an ability of his own too due to his Mind and Plant spheres. He had three unique Mordrem Guard Commanders (raised from the corpses of three sylvari, apparently, if Diarmid's backstory is anything to go by) acting as the generals of his army, and each time any of the commanders was slain, Mordremoth simply transferred their consciousness (or just fascimiles of their memories and skills possibly via the Dream?) into a new clone body that awakened from the Blighting Trees in Dragon's Stand, effectively making those commanders immortal as long as the Jungle Dragon lived. Sadly this stuff was never really explored that much in HoT; it was a fascinating concept and could've given us a bit more explanation about the nature of the Dream and how sylvari consciousness is formed.
---
As for where souls go, it's an interesting topic as well. Like we learn in ["The Departing"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Departing), norn and humans have separate afterlives and once they enter theirs, they can never meet each other again due to whatever restrictions these afterlives seem to have. It's unknown if only humans have multiple sub-afterlives like the Fissure of Woe for Balthazar followers and the Underworld for Grenth followers, or if other races have such too (e.g. there being separate afterlives for followers of Raven, Bear etc.) although I imagine humans are special snowflakes in this regard. At least humans were able to move from one subrealm to the other under some circumstances, though, as seen in Nightfall where the Realm of Torment was connected to various planes (whether this was by design or part of Abaddon's machinations is unknown, but I imagine some GW1 veteran can provide more insight into the intricacies of it beyond what's seen in wiki). Kralkatorrik's rampage through the Mists further weakened the boundaries of the realms, thus likely allowing Gwen and others to form the Mist Wardens and fight under Glint against the Crystal Dragon.
---
Interestingly there's at least one crossroads in the Mists where multiple races' ghosts can meet albeit temporarily. The Domain of the Lost, witnessed in "The Departing", is a region of the Underworld where each spirit suffering a sudden, traumatic death ends up into (while spirits who have come to terms with their passing get to move on into their respective afterlives). The lost spirits in this domain must then retrieve their name and identity (via various quests tailored to the spirit's personality) to become whole again and then be judged by Grenth's servants to pass onto their designated afterlife. Whether this means Demmi ended up in the Domain of the Lost or came to terms with her death upon hallucinating/witnessing Tybalt  and ended up in her human afterlife is thus unknown.
---
It's unknown how many human souls were devoured by Dhuum since he redirected the River of Souls to feed him, so it's possible that almost every denizen of the Underworld (save the few we see in the Ice Wastes) were permanently devoured by Dhuum and thus we'd never see Kieran Thackeray, Demmi etc. again depending on what their designated faith was and which afterlife they'd end up in. Tybalt and Forgal, if they ended up in their racial afterlives, should be safe as we have no indication of Branded invading anywhere beyond some of the human afterlives. We also don't know how many souls Kralkatorrik consumed during his flight in the Mists, but those spirits seem to be gone for good and now "live on" in Aurene.
---
It appears that Balthazar (and later, Kralkatorrik's) soul have been consumed by Aurene as Balthazar's sword reacted positively to her but not to Kralk despite both being in close proximity to Balthazar's fall. Sadly we don't know if Elder Dragon souls can pass on into the Mists or if their close connection to the All and the magical domains makes their soul become one with magic of the ley-lines so they can never truly pass on once they'd ascended to Elder Dragonhood. Personally I'd love to meet Zhaitan and Mordremoth's ghosts in the Mists and have a chat with them to learn how much their respective Torments twisted their psyche and what their unaltered, "original" personalities would be like: I imagine Mordremoth would be an ass regardless given his god complex, and Zhaitan might be a well-intentioned extremist, but that remains to be seen if the devs ever decide to revisit this spirit idea and if we need to consult with dead dragons to learn more about the mysteries of the All and the Antikytheria mechanism. I'd be thrilled to hear Zhaitan's voice, regardless, after the wonderful performances by Nolan North and Fred Tatasciore for Mordremoth and Kralkatorrik, respectively.

lots of people still confused about it so here:
---
USING LFG FOR ANYTHING OTHER THEN GRUPE CONTENT IS BANNABLE
---
HOME INSTANCE IS NOT CONSIDERED GRUP CONTENT BY ANET.
---
selling or not dont use LFG for home instance. Selling home instance is actually ok as long as you dont use LFG, you can spam map chat - real
---
Don't know if you just trolling or baiting but ok.
---
Being a elitist is just being a casual raider by their terms. You are not better player because you have gear and know a rotation and the fight. That just makes you automatic no brain.
---
WoW classic isn't even out yet. You have beta numbers yes but I was talking about private servers the only way he can be the king. There is no way he will be the king of WoW classic because there is no competition even.
---
King of nothing means he can only be king if he is the only player.
---
I'm glad that Anet does not support this "event" it just harms the game really.
---
Raids are not challenging.
---
Just 6 guilds? Then why the spam and the toxicity against casuals? Raiders are casuals too.
---
I probably did more for the game than those 6 guilds will ever do in their entire game span considering they just hate the game and are going to leave soon anyway.
---
Have fun on your WoW vanilla raids, casual.
---
Well, it'll be the most watched event I'm sure. I remember ERP1 beating out the million dollar ESL finals.
---
every thread, all you do is post negative shit.  Its kinda sad.  I think you literally post more than the raiders.  =/
---
First tournament got more views than any ANET hosted tournament so, there you go.
---

That reply was to the tech director who specifically asked for more information, not implying you or any other player doesn’t know there’s an issue.

It takes 5 hours on average to get everything done related to mount. You can slowly gain reward track participation by doing dailies as well. Flipping objectives require a kill of a single guard only and you can finish most of those in eotm as well.

---
Second part was too ironic for me to change lol
---
its not about having many hours or be burned out, its about getting new people that somewhat share the same interest.  
---
wvw on my server seems dead apart from maybe 2 hours, but even then its not really fun since there is no real competition with nice / fun fights. its either you steamroll or the enemy does it with you. counterplay or any higher stuff apart from fluff...nope.  
---
pvp is reduced to skillspam plus aidsbuilds...i don't know about high competitive play, i am not playing there but on lower levels its definitly not nice to play. you can't have that many active defenses on how much you get shit on. but thats not something personal, even my friends which basically only play pvp since ages and were always in the better half of the pvpers all share the same sentiment.  
---
i do not want to imagine being a completly new player without any idea about pvp tbh.  
---
in terms of raids, dungeons and fractals: hard to find people which fit in. basically more and more people leave out of the game while getting new people is somewhat impossible. 2 years back i always had a fast replacement when someone left...now you search for half a year while peopel constantly go away from the game, even if they aren't veterans. my raidgroup is not a full static since a 3/4 year. it simply sucks.
---
Everlasting gobstopper?
---
you dont sell goods with sharing home instance you offer a service same as selling a spot in raid/dungeons
---
A kick in the pleb kind of casual raiders (called elitists(LUL) that think they are good for doing casual raids. LUL go to vanilla land casual where you just fail or get good in real game modes, any that requires brain and is not completed like in first week of release.
---
i wasnt talking about viewers, i was talking about participants in game? How many participants did Anet tournaments have?
---
The policy in the Guild Wars 2 forum is that you are not allowed to mention anything that is going on in one matchup (mu) This include litterally everything even nice things. If it is related to a matchup it will be deleated.
---
&gt; If they were balanced to do low damage to people but more damage to siege &amp; walls they could work fine.
---
Warclaws were a nice idea but the chain pull is shit. But I think they were onto something. The chain pull should be much stronger and would be a good incentive to have it unlocked and use it in a siege. It using supply is fine, but the ratio of supply/damage is really really not worth it other than doing the achievement. The AoE stomp shouldn't finish players. It would be fine I guess if it removed 25% of a downed enemy HP or something like that though.
---
&gt; Maybe something like a wizards tower that is not as hard to take but gives all your other stuff a boost somehow ?
---
This is interesting. It could provide stat bonuses on other objectives, maybe even increased supply capacity, or increase points for each other objectives owned in the map. There's definitely something better to do than SMC. At this point, SMC outer walls are barely of any use and the lack of inner walls is a pain.
---
* I would suggest they remove AC as it really makes taking objectives fun and some servers focus on turtling up.
---
* Add more mounts to WvW with a variety of usefulness. Some could be a lot stronger on doors, some could be against walls, some could provide help in a zerg fight, etc.
---
* Server rebalance. Currently BG is fully stacked compared to other servers. Maybe consider having links with 3 or 4 servers to makes them much more populated. At least until another work around such as WvW alliances is there.
---
People love to AFK though. Check out Divinity's Reach, Lion's Arch, most VIP pass areas and I'm sure there's plenty more good AFK spots.
---
What most should be allowed if its function is to find other players to do the content in the game with them.
---
You can also sell "services" like a spot in a raid/dungeon group
---

What do you mean? What about all those my first world completion posts?
---
Especially after the last patch that raised condi benchmark to almost 37k, no renegade (especially one that is putting up ala) should be coming close to fb dps. And most boons a FB can offer as a healer will be the same as a dps since it just means swapping out the spirit sword for stand your ground. (Though really, the buffs are similar since renegade can just swap legends simple enough--ex dwf during many stability friendly fights.)
---
Ultimately, you can even do fractals with a scourge healer, just about what maximised efficiency.

This is why you don't boost an Engineer or an Elementalist if you don't know what the F!@# you're doing.  [There was a thread a couple days ago about getting into more complex classes.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ctjlf0/unsure_how_to_adapt_to_more_complex_classes/)  Don't play Weaver until you know what your traditional main-hand, off-hand and terrestrial weapon skills do; you're far better off just playing Tempest via Heart of Thorns.  
---
Go back and play base Elementalist until you're comfortable with whatever weapon you're using (minus sword).  You need to have a good understanding of your (1-3) (main-hand) and (4-5) (off-hand) skills before you start throwing dual skills into the mix.  Staff, Scepter, Dagger -- your main damage is in Fire or Air, Sustain in Water, Earth - Condi/Defense.
---
Maybe you should actually *read* the rules...
---
Quick reference guide:
---
* Fire = damage
---
* Water = support
---
* Air = utility
---
* Earth = defensive
---
It really depends on which weapons you're planning on using and what kind of build you're going with, but generally speaking those are the main flavors of each attunement. 
---
As Weaver each mainhand weapon gains a new #3 skill based on your current attunements. It combines those flavors for a new skill, but you can still double attune for the original ones.
---
As you do more high level stuff you'll get into something called a "rotation" which helps you juggle your attunements and cooldowns to optimize damage, but for beginners you can always opt for a flowchart system of ifs and thens. Let us know in the comments which weapon set you want to play with and we could whip something up.
---
If you're running a power damage build, regardless of weapon choice for now, you can try sticking to just going back and forth between full fire and then checking out other attunement options when on full cooldown. Use this as training wheels to get a feel for the other options while honing your main source of damage output.
---
I didn't want to overwhelm you with endgame level terminology and practices so let me know if this is either too unclear or too basic.
---
Honestly not at all. FA weaver is pretty easy. To put it simply, it's kinda like core condi ranger from way back when. Lota of buttons to press but the rotation is so simple and importantly it loops perfectly. The loop part is especially important. Easy to memorize. Honestly things like condi mirage are a lot harder or heck even condi renegade.
---
you mean this rule?

Try /r/guildrecruitment or gw2 forums.

Is the ERP not an event ? This whole thread is more in line with the rules than 80% of the low effort posts/people asking frequently asked questions on here, yet all of a sudden now it's a problem ?
---
It is, that means it's handled on case be case basis. Also means that some mod has to look into it. 
---
Since this thread got set as unlisted (you can't find it by scrolling anymore) it seems like it *did* break the rule.

Maybe he shouldn't post a couple of those threads within one day...

Stop being irritating and pointing out that things like this are only relevant to a tiny subset of the wider community and are primarily relevant to people that watch Twitch, not those that play the game.

I mean, what on earth do you know about [providing](https://www.reddit.com/r/GW2Exchange/) [things](https://www.reddit.com/r/gw2economy/) for the community?

No doubt soon we'll have a user with a low engagement on this subreddit making a facetious remark about "friendliest community"...

The rules don't apply to certain segments of the playerbase, don't you know?

You know that is simply automatic for the reporting account, right?

You could go report the top thread of /r/all and see the same result, doesn't mean anyone blocked it.
---
Gemstore content rotates at 16:00 server time. It will go up on sale then. (8 mins to go)

Not quite the same...

---
*cough*
---
&gt; Advertising your stream here is not allowed, exceptions being you streaming an event or for specific stream(er) request threads. **These are handled on case be case basis**.
---
That's different from "It's fine". 
---
However, result clearly speaks for me. This thread got unlisted, you can't find it anymore through scrolling. That's what happens to threads if they break a rules (but not hard enough to get deleted).
---
Handled on case by case basis, mod said "nope, not okay", thread got unlisted. 
---
&gt; Under the advertising groups/communities part, other community organized stuff like Pink Day is also listed as a special case bc they're once a year, just like the ERP. I really don't see your issue here.
---
Maybe he should stop posting a couple of those threads within one day.
---
New exclusive dyes, outfits, and chairs. As a gw2 player, to properly compete in the fashion wars(the true meta) you need a descent wardrobe and options.

I take it you don't use this sub much? That sort of thing was suggested a *long* time ago, as part of the proposed Showoff Sunday changes.
---
The wider reddit community didn't like it, it wasn't implemented.
---
both are tournaments.
---
I mean, I just found it like anybody else did. On my feed. It's not been unlisted, could be not showing on your feed because you've reported it as spam already or something.

Guessing you're having a bad day because your level of upset is weird for what this is about. Take a break from the internet dude.
---
Developers might have *little* say in the development priorities, and I'm sure the higher-ups don't play much, but asserting that the developers don't care and don't play needs a source or you're just being pessimistic.
---
I have this acount for like a year? couldnt know if it happened before. Sad tho, so much bloat could be reduced/compacted.
---
Odd, I received my rewards today, so I guess maybe there is just a few hours of discrepancy for some reason. I'm still wondering why, maybe the servers were working for some people a couple hours early or something xD
---
Since when twitch streams that speak bad about the game and say they are leaving help the game? Twitch views would only count if they did something positive!
---
But if you say masses is what matter I don't know what to tell you. Democracy can be tyrany of majority. Does not mean one alone cant be right against many.
---
Saying people will start playing GW2 after being flamed by pve raider is delusional at best. It give an extremely bad idea of the gw2 community and it is bad publicity. GW2 also was never about raids.  Neither GW1. 
---
Maybe I help individuals of players with positive actions I believe every small action counts. I'm not in for the cash grab, fame and leave. But why bother explaining you are too greedy to understand. I continue to help the community either you acknowledge it or not. You can keep downvoting my words all you want. I know when you and they all leave to WoW vanilla the community will be a better place.
---
Because he is a "celebrity" right? ;)
---
The OP is talking about the community as a whole, how is the number of participants relevant in any way?

You're a specialist on justifying stupid things though so can't wait to see this one

I am the defition of a gw2 casual ( only play when story comes out basically ) and i'm having a lot of fun watching this
---
Weird thing is I'm able to go to 70 character slots but according to the wiki if I had the "maximum number of character slots before purchasing the Deluxe or Ultimate edition of Heart of Thorns, it's possible for it to have 70 character slots instead of 69". I still had the purchase character slot button, but I exited to character select to see if I made a mistake in counting and the option disappeared. Wonder if it's now possible to get a higher number than 70 if I didn't exit.
---
You obviously haven't played Neverwinter or Elder Scrolls Online due to this statement of yours "The reason some MMOs that aren't using DX12 still seem to have a better CPU/GPU balance is mostly due to having less draw calls to send. Black Desert, for example, is notorious for looking great but having a very low draw distance with massive pop-up like in games of yore, which is why you can only see enemies that are relatively close to you. You can mimic this behaviour in GW2 through the model limit setting, and you'll see your FPS shoot up." because I can push the setting so high that I do take a hit in the FPS (never to the level of GW2 though) and there is no longer any "fog" in the game.
---
Explain to me why I have to run around with blob graphics (I am not kidding as it literally is a blob as all settings are at the minimum) and get less fps than on max in the other MMOs?
---
I'll hop on metabattle when I have a character that I am really clueless about. Happened with my mesmer - I just couldn't figure out how not to die in two hits of whatever I was fighting.
---
I grabbed a build off of metabattle, which was enough to help me stopped getting killed every time a mob sneezed, and from there I modified and played with the build on my own.
---
sounds a bit unbalanced. ^^
---
If only you could use it in wvw as when u finished someone. Have it being like a victory pose.
---
And with him GW 2‘s presence on twitch
---
&gt; The OP is talking about the community as a whole, how is the number of participants relevant in any way?
---
in my opinon in game participants are more important than twitch views of the event when we want to compare game events in gw2.
---
The game and company lives from players playing the game and not people watching the game on twitch. 
---
This event will also most likely not attract many new players to gw2 since most of the viewers already play gw2, so what benefit does it actually have for Anet or all other players besides the 60 participating?
---
I don't think he was trying to be polite, mate.
---
Firebrand Scourge and Scrapper, try getting me down.
---
How well does it work with Overwolf, GemFx, SweetFx?
---
Anet has dev panel for it. It’s hack only for players because it can’t be accessed without 3-rd party program.
---
What about all the "oooh!" and "aaah!" comments when someone posts a portrait they commissioned? Do you downvote them as well since they don't contribute either?
---
Decided to try this on new PC, gave some nice fps in cities. Noticed bit screentearing, turned on vsync and crashed :/ iirc vsync didn't crash on old laptop.
---
Just because other options are worse, it doesn't make anet and gw2 good automatically.
---
GW2 is neglected by devs in most of available game modes. The ambitious project from 2012 evolved into gemstore fashion simulator for retired secretaries. Whatever they release, there is no ambition, no passion, every patch feels like it's been done only to feel required target for quarterly payment bonus. Things are being done at barely minimum state, only to keep the money flowing.
---
I loved this game and wanted it to be better, only to be cursed into witnessing it's degradation through years. Currently, I'm cured. I don't about gw2, living world, build templates, ascended food, mounts and other bullshit anet is pretending to care about. I'm following the game only for laughs and to be there to witness when it gets finally shut down and anet fucks off into oblivion, the only place this company deserves.
---
Dodging my questions, saying I'm the one toxic after being toxic, ok.
---
If you answer, instead of being toxic try to answer my questions above first. Instead of running around being toxic.
---
How do you know that someone knows what they are doing though? 
---
A lot of builds require some "work" to actually shine. Saying that you know how your build works without actually providing even close to support/healing/damage output of meta build is just a bunch of bs.
---
Is it really worth it? Yeah...by a lot. How I feel about meta builds. I have the mentality that I want to be as efficient as possibe/winners mentality. I tryhard everything. How do I feel about other people playing non meta builds? Idm as long as you're pulling your weight. If you're a healer, then heal me ffs. If you're a buffer, then I want 25 might no matter how you do it. If you're a dps, try not to be lower than 15k. I can dps the rest lmao.
---
these are the streams the exception was mainly added for. it is unlisted for a moment due to too many reports or your settings hiding it due to you downvoting it
---
I hear the voices in your head just fine since you keep repeating what they tell you
---
lol holy shit that bait.  We all thought sc didn't have mo cm on bc of the camera hack lol
---
No I am not dense I am finding out your real intelligence and how much of a troll you are.  Anyway troll on since you have nothing intelligent to add or say.
---
about what?
---
I'm just there for the [frog memes](https://imgur.com/L53Ilga).

Good. That way you made me relevant.

---
I'm sure we need all of these.
---
Since everyone is telling you how boosting can be really overwhelming especially on ele or other complicated classes let me offer you the other side of the coin, I have NEVER leveled a char in this game and started on a boosted ele, honestly if you are decent at games I think you will be fine, treat HoT like a long tutorial and if you get confused just look up the bits of info you need as you go.
---
Yes it can be very overwhelming but learning at Max level was faster for me as I could analyze all of my abilities right off the bat, I also had the luxury of being in HoT so I was also progressing my character meaningfully while I was learning the game, if you are new to RPGs or MMOs than I wouldn't recommend it but if you have a good grasp on mechanics I think it is fine.
---
Dont watch it then
---
there is nothing more boring than arena nets let's play ama streams every 10 years where they only answer question like "do charr like cake?"
---
Only for fall damage
---
No? I am enjoying it.
---
I just made you think that you are relevant because one of the voices in your head is mine.
---
Wonder why people found it offensive. It sounds like it glorify the eastern culture. I still not sure which Race to pick, I want it to be thematically right and serene. Thinking about the Salvari - due to the forest, but not sure.
---
all your comments above of course
---
A-MAZ-ING
---
Gracias! Yo en concreto no casteo pero le doy bombo por las redes. Y sí, en la parte de comentarios técnicos el stream en español es de lo mejorcito!
---
This reddit is a meme paradise, everything gets overhyped or shit on for all the wrong reasons \o/
---
I am as a much a gw2 player like every other "hardcore" player too, you arrogant cuck.
---
If you like it, use it, if you don't like it, don't use it \o/
---
You are actually nobody. Just like most gw2 players. And anet.
---
They're necessary within certain margins for more skilled PvE or PvP content amongst a general skill distribution.  
---
When I was pugging in GW2 I never expected more than 70-80% of benchmarks.  It wasn't uncommon to get pugs that were useless running builds and rotations that did something like 20-25% of benchmarks.  We'd finish a boss or Fractal and kick people afterwards.  If someone was running a decent build and not sandbagging the team then we'd teach/carry them through 99/100cm or raids.
---
yeah... that's not a quote.
---
and you and everyone else who leaves for classic.
---
Contrary to you, I'm aware of my irrelevancy. That's why I'm not creating shit threads like this one.
---
And I'm not leaving for classic. I left long ago and don't play mmos at all.
---
&gt;...it just feel like a work and this is not the reason why I play video games.
---
Meta builds provide a excellent starting point for players looking to get started with a class/role. Meta builds can almost always be changed to better suite different situations or even your own play style. A big part of why I like to run meta builds for group content is time. We all only have so much time to play video games and get shit done, so when it comes to group content running shitty (not everybuild) off meta builds with a shitty group comp(not every non-meta group) only hurts you and your teammates because you all cant bring yourself to run close to a meta build for group content. 
---
&gt;I know that meta are done to maximize everything but is it really worth it?
---
For group content absolutely, meta builds work best together and rek fractals,raids,dungeons w/e with great efficiency. Imo if your off meta builds and group comps can keep up and get shit done I dont think most people will really care that its off meta.
---
So we need 3 info posts and 3 fluff that are the same, a 4th fluff showing the chair which was shown 1 week ago in the blog post.
---
The only one relevant is 8 which is the first posted. 7 of those can be deleted.
---
Yes. https://mightyteapot.tv/raidtournament/rules
---
Fair enough :)
---
How long does the key farm take? Sounds fun
---
This is my thinking as well. I will normally look up several meta builds when making a new character as starting points, play around with them a little, then tweak them to focus on the parts that I enjoy the most.
---
That way while I might not be the 100% most optimized build I know I have a solid base and just let my build slowly evolve over time to fit my playstyle.
---
Or the flip side is I might take a concept that I want then look at the meta builds to help me figure out how to make my idea as effective as it can be. Like my juggernaut flamethrower engi for example, not the most powerful build out there, but I love running around in open world content pretending to be a TF2 pyro for some casual fun now and then:P
---
Weird... I kinda get the feeling that the Anet employee posting there is trying to discourage selling home instance node LFG's, which is fine with me, but in order to maintain some morale high ground in his argument, doing LFG's for free home instance sharing is kinda taking a bullet as well. Despite it being a nice community spirit kinda thing to do. 
---
Hard to explain my thoughts on this.
---
Doesn't seem very well thought out overall, I'm not a big fan of spamming map chat, I'm more likely just to not bother and do my home instance alone, get it over and done with for the day. The LFG tool was a quick and convenient tool to help people out.
---
Sadly, no.  Anet GM said in a recent post when I asked directly if offering home instance for FREE via LFG was okay.  Answer was no and yes you can get in trouble for it if anyone decides to report you.
---
Do I agree?  Of course not, but that's what he said.  However, selling raids is totally fine because that's group content but home instance sharing (free or otherwise) is not group content.  Again, I don't agree with that, but it what he said.
---
Contact support.
---
Just sent in a ticket, still awaiting a response. But it's just weird as I've never recalled talking or being rude in general towards anyone?
---
That’s the joke
---
It's entirely possible your account was compromised.
---
Yeah, just a joke. Right. Sounds elitist already.
---
So, accourding to the comments it sounds like offering a home instance is bannable even for free.  how about searching for a full home instance via lfg?
---
Why get upset over what other people choose to do, which doesn't actually hurt anyone at all? 
---
I share mine for free, too, but I see no reason whatsoever to judge other people for selling, if that's what they choose to do. I don't really understand *why* anyone would pay when there are usually lots of instances for free, but hey, maybe some people have money to burn, or just don't like accepting freebies? (I know a lot of people like this in real life -- they're too proud to take what they call "handouts" and feel much better if you let them pay you or trade something, etc.)
---
I don't know, it just feels really scummy to me to bask in the positive feelings that come with sharing what you have, but then turn around and act like other people are bad or immoral just because they choose to sell something that people want (so long as they're not taking advantage of people who are in some dire situation, etc. which obviously isn't a situation that's at play here). Let people do their thing.
---
Correct!
---
&gt;I kinda get the feeling that the Anet employee posting there is trying to discourage selling home instance node LFG's
---
I think they are saying that outright as they back up that OP's suspension and then in another comment say that mining a home instance is not "group content" and that the LFG is for forming groups to do group content. It gets blurry when you start talking about raid selling vs home instance selling, but I think for anet them not considering home instances group content is how they make the difference. Not saying whats good or bad either way, just trying to (as best I can understand atm) accurately state anets stance here.
---
The dude running/dodging into the wall in the background stole the show.
---
As well as the previous responses for raid training discords you can also check in forums and r/guildrecruitment for guilds
---
None, just got it randomly when I did the level 10 personal story before deleting a character. :V
---
ah the good old times where you get more bandit crests from chests than needed to buy keys :D
---
well one would be of course overzealous mods but the reason why it came to this in the first place is because we used to have matchup threads on the forums yeaaars ago and Anet did not like how players interacted with eachother so wiped that off enitrely since then. But as things are on the official forums, they go too far and delete important threads because it barely mentions specific matchups :)
---
Gem -&gt; gold rate incresed by how much after they put keys on sale? 35%, too?
---
What savings ;)
---
I think it would be okay, if at least players would get informed about dr, so they could hop between cursed shore and frostgorge at least
---
I deleted my first and only character from beta years ago. My nearest-aged character is 5, feels bad. Congrats though mate!
---
Thanks so much! This is super helpful and I will be saving it for later!

&gt; Let's catch all 50 ranger pets. A map and Pokedex.

Me: cool, I'd better save this!

I love it.

First of that anet did not support him, was teapot fail not anets. Snd i see not rly a diffrenc both are events who are rly special and do not happen rly often.
---
&gt;Twitch views would only count if they did something positive!
---
Bringing in thousands of viewers **is** objectively positive.
---
You don't get to chose the circumstances where the definition of the word applies and where it doesn't.
---
&gt;Does not mean one alone cant be right against many.
---
When the goal of a game is **literally** to entertain the majority... If the majority is entertained, then the goal is successful.
---
Therefor, by definition, Teapots tournament has been objectively successful &amp; well received.
---
Your opinion doesn't matter here.
---
&gt;Saying people will start playing GW2 after being flamed by pve raider is delusional at best.
---
When the fuck has teapot flamed people in this tournmanet? How is anyone being flamed?
---
I swear you're making shit up to be mad about, like a special little snowflake.
---
&gt;Maybe I help individuals of players with positive actions I believe every small action counts.
---
HAHAHAAHAHA the fucking irony.
---
Hate to break it to you, but you haven't been very positive mate.
---
&gt;I continue to help the community either you acknowledge it or not.
---
It's simply a fact that Teapot has brought in more people &amp; interest to the community than you have.
---
Just the fucking **trailer** for his tournament got over 15k views, which is an absurd number for Guildwars 2 in its current state.
---
You sound a bit silly here.
---
Playing around with my Daredevil. Running Crit Strikes as a permanent Spec slot, obv. Not sure if I want the steal boons from Trickery &amp; all the little things it gives, or if I want the automatic stun break &amp; heal on initiative spent from Acrobatics.
---
What do y'all recommend? Trickery gives amazing fury uptime when combined with crit strikes, and stacking fury lets me stack extra might, so I do oodles of damage, but the free stun break &amp; heal is pretty handy for survivability, and I don't think Daredevil exactly lacks damage without Trickery. But with the dodges, heal on crit, heal on crit FOOD, and signet of malice's insane passive healing, Daredevil doesn't exactly lack survivability either.
---
That is not a reason to flame anet that, they did something wrong or did not support him without any reason.
---
Just tried it right now. Relogging it will fix the bar. Had to relog several times before I finally rolled over into lv25. Probably could have skipped the relogging. The exp value when hovering over the bar is still accurate.
---
Nah, relogging does not fix it. It actually resets it to a degree too from what I witnessed.
---
Also, even if you use just enough loot to get to say, 95% of the progress bar and then go finish the rest of the level by completing any other task such as a heart; your Level will *still* reset.
---
Yep, I sent in a report. Just kind of surprised it's in the game. I wonder if this happens with Casino Coins?
---
Are you me?
---
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen. I literally bought one slot a few days ago. This always happens. XD

Dude you started with the 3 most complicated classes in the game lol.

Just use the HoT boost on a warrior, guard, ranger, or necro.

Alternatively, YouTube to help a bit

Thank you for your sacrifice.

If I take 3 daredevils do I get 9 dodges?
---
I already have most of the skins, having played for 7 years, but the dye was great. I wish ANet had put more effort into this but I'm not surprised that they did because they need to keep new stuff behind a paywall. 🤷🏾‍♀️ Like, can we get Ominous armor and weapons? That idea was low effort but it's better than giving out old stuff like it's anything more than a glorified token gift.
---
this will have 300up votes at most while a random guy posting a map completion made after 7years of playtime will have 1K more upvote (:(:(:

WoW, the game we all need, most intensive gameplay, not static at all, RAIDZ, kys

don't ask for 250li when you have 0

WvW and PVP are by far more toxic than raids. In PVP they are 24/7 telling each other to kill themselves and in WvW you can't even join squads without voice chat. So yeah, let those two modes die first please and then raids, so that we all can focus on what the game really is all about.. 
---
PLAYING BEARBOW RANGERS RUNNING AROUND KILLING SHIT, THEN GETTING KILLED BY POCKET RAPTORS AND WHINE ON THE FORUMS FOR ANET TO NERF THE EXPANSION ZONES BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO DIFFICULT!
---
I did not caught them all in 7 years... I mean u Always use the same 2 e
---
It's funny you say I'm not positive but you the one insulting/bashing/laughing at other people just for saying their opinion.
---
That attitude overall does not help the game.
---
Can't wait for WoW vanilla to wash you and them away and bring back GW2 to the friendly community it was.
---
Nah ESO is more casual I think. Agreed on the rest
---
This is why I have a spreadsheet set up ...
---
~20% saving vs Aug 20 price

~13% saving vs Jul 30 price
---
my opinion on "meta-ness" is that i don't mind what build you are using as long as it gets the job done. if anything i'm usually more mad at the people that complain about a problem that they can (and should) be able to deal with by changing their build a little but refuse to do it because its "not meta".
---
for example i was pugging 100cm on alacren one day when no pain no gain was an instab... i was doing the ball mechanic cus nobodyelse even bothered to try and at the end of the fight our BS started complaining that boonstrip was bad and boss had too much protection uptime and i snapped and just told him that he should have either done the ball himself to let me boonstrip with mallyx or swapped to spellbreaker and boonstrip himself instead of being such a whiny deadweight
---
Using meta rotations isn't a work. The rotation is built like that because it makes the most sense and every skill compliments each other. You don't have to 100% follow a rotation to be good, but you need to have a really good understanding of your class AND your abilities. And when you have that, you will naturally somewhat follow the meta rotation by yourself, because you will understand why the skills are used in the order they are in.
---
Do people have to use meta builds? Absolutely not. But at the very least people expect you to know what you're doing. That means you can use a different build as long as it's very decently crafted and is actually competitive. Having random traits and utilities just because you like them, but don't actually need them, and then performing badly is something nobody wants.
---
What's the name of that blue dye?
---
There's nothing you _technically_ can't do with exotics, but you'll be at a disadvantage in WvW/Fractals/Raids compared to having Ascended gear.
---
I guess I was just spoiled by GW1, where they had expensive equipment that people could grind for the cosmetics (or just for the sense of achievement) which was identical statswise to standard endgame equipment.
---
How long before you're reported then for map spamming? .. O\_o
---
Ok then lets do a World Boss Tournament, or Meta Train tournament, or "Standing in Queensdale Discussing random shit" tournament. 
---
GW2 has raids, making it a Raid game. The only thing that makes GW2 Raids better than WoW's is that they are exclusive and unique. That is what makes the grand majority of casuals bitter, that one small part of the content is skill intensive and they consider it "too much" without having actually given an effort to adapt.
---
Yea i did encounter him in 2 matches yesterday, he also got an guardian
---
Start your own group, or join a training one. Be sure to pick one of the meta builds for starters (you can always make your builds later, when youre more familiar with raid environment). Most importantly, prepare for a wild ride, you will see both the good side with really nice comms/pugs and clear runs, as well as the toxicity of the raid community (kicks from squads due to having 1LI too few, rage, quitting etc.).
---
Fresh Air requires crits to reset air attunement, hence why we use Dual Strike (Water/Fire) because it hits twice. However, if you don't have 100% crit chance, well, there's a decent chance you won't crit, and won't get both resets. This also happens if either hit misses (blindness) or if the enemy you're hitting dies before a hit connects.
---
As an aside, S/D power weaver rotation goes aa3, fa243, ff4532, wf3, aw, aa
---
I've heard this story before.
---
Most likely not as those items are involved in very specific ways in the storyline, ie building a “high tech” oven.
---
You are delusional if you don't think you're toxic.
---
That looks pretty cool tbh
---
You would think someone who has been their partner for years and managed to create the biggest community event for years now would get even the sliiiiightest lee-way.
---
Not a bad idea to add some basic exo gear, but daily stuff is stuff a vet should know what/when/why they need :V
---
I think HoT Bladed armor is the go-to for quick stat selectable? Not sure what you would do for exo back / weapons aside from crafting or jump to ascended and trinkets are probably easier to get ascended than exotic for a lot of stat options
---
Pepo is cringy when Pepo talks about pepoself in 3rd person.
---
u/DrStephenCW I don't know if you've done anything about it, but just so you know, we've been having some pretty big fights in one of the alpine maps tonight (Gandara's) and they have been very smooth, there has been no lag at all, at least not that I could notice. Who knows, perhaps it'll get laggy again in 5 minutes, but so far so good.
---
Can we get some tacos in the game please?
---
This one of the most retrograde points of view I have read in Reddit. Let's slice it a bit:
---
&gt;game participants are more important than twitch views
---
No, they aren't, they aren't for any type of tournament in any type of game that gets to be streamed. 
---
We could extrapolate to how the current biggest prize pool in the history of online gaming is being battled by only 18 teams of 5 people. Twitch is an incredibly important part of the whole event and always has been.
---
&gt;The game and company live from players playing the game and not people watching the game on twitch.
---
This comes from the false premise that people that play and people that watch streams aren't the same. That's obviously not the case and I'm amazed you could even type it.
---
&gt;This event will also most likely...
---
I'm sure hot takes on what the event can or can't do are legitimate in every way (they aren't) but the event itself is still the biggest one to date that came from the community. This is simply an undeniable fact and the thing that was being discussed to begin with.
---
Your quality has dropped too harshly
---
I missed the vet thingy, sorry!
---
I agree on the gear, and trinkets should just be ascended imo, they only take a few hours to get anyway.
---
Why you buy gems in advance. Gem prices always go up in august for the anniversary sale, be prepared.
---
It is an open world action / adventure mmo with some focus on world building and story.
---
A tournament for pve heroes, huh?
---
wow whole 1 %
---
Anet is not an indie company, it is a reason to blame them for not supporting things like this in forms of making casting / watching easier.
---
They could easily dedicate a few devs for a few hours to be cameraman if they didn't want players to showcase such thing and it'd be ok.
---
They did not support this. In either way of support via in-game features or rewards. Twist that around all you want.
---
Breaking the ToS is how we got a dps meter though. So you are obviously wrong, it is not that black and white.
---
I hope Anet is paying you for typing such stupid stuff. Instead of being such babies they could've made the "hack" a real feature.
---
You level a character to level 10 (with tomes or whatever) and then do the first story steps until you get a key. That key is limited to one per week:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Key_farming
---
If you want actual gold , without knowing what you're doing, or learning how to do it , just run pvp during season. The skirmish track gives actual gold , and  a fair amount of it. ( once you're on the repeatable Byzantium track)
---
[deleted]
---
There is only one kind of key, and it works with your GW2 account.
---
*where* are you seeing this offer?
---
And if you're not in the mood for green, the Arcane Dye in the Kralkatorrik kit is also a good choice.

Most open world casuals only spamm the "1" autoattack button anyway. Rotations and builds are useful for endgame content, story a bit less (but make it easier), raids and fractals.
---
it just seems suspicious why they would add the NCsoft key and not just Key
---
If you have Living World Season 2 unlocked, run your new level 80s through episode 6 - Tangled Paths.
---
It's super quick, and you'll get a free Black Lion Key!
---
Guess twitch isn't your thing then
---
Nope, all copies that were bought were legitimate copies. I bought them straight through Anet itself.
---
DO NOT
---
Under any circumstance buy from G2A
---
Who's "they", anyway?
---
Never buy at g2a they scam the shit out of you with stolen keys
---
Enameled Amenity except the shoulders which are Sea Green
---
I recommend DLGamer!
---
listen man if i did not have a money problem i would buy the game 2 years ago hence why i have been playing the free version and now there just is not enough content for me to advance

Behold, the immovable object. You'd best believe that I'm having both shrouds available.

Thanks, matches the weapon colour nicely. :&gt;

If you paint with strokes that broad you might cover every mmo that's on the market right now

I think you mean *venti*.

a few stray hair go a looong way in improving hairlines

At least you know how to screenshot.

&gt;"You've played in this zone too long, go somewhere else for awhile" 
---
would be fair if actual system msgs like that popped out instead of quietly making open world even more worthless than it already is
---
Congratulations!
---
There are portals in the area known as the Aerodrome, all you have to do is go in one of seven portals and boom, you are in a raid.
---
&gt; No, they aren't, they aren't for any type of tournament in any type of game that gets to be streamed.
---
i wasnt talking about what is important for the tournament, i was talking about what is important for participation of **im game events**.
---
&gt; We could extrapolate to how the current biggest prize pool in the history of online gaming is being battled by only 18 teams of 5 people. Twitch is an incredibly important part of the whole event and always has been.
---
Are you seriously comparing the impact the ERP has on GW2 with the impact that your other mentioned tournament has on another game?
---
&gt; This comes from the false premise that people that play and people that watch streams aren't the same. That's obviously not the case and I'm amazed you could even type it.
---
They are absolutely the same, yes, at least what the ERP viewer are concerned. Because next to no one that has never played gw2 or its raids will care about this tournament. Most viewers are current or ex raiders that wont be logging in more just because of this live stream so its positive effect on the game and its player base is pretty limited.
---
Hope it doesn't take another 7 to learn about Print Screen.
---
I guess just general/open world?

If it's not disgustingly elitist I'll be disappointed

I really, really hate this advice, because it replaces what should be a few hours of fooling around with possible days of tedium.

Assuming normal power food is an exact 4.5% increase (it's different for every class but we're just simplifying the math here a bit), the break-even point between power-food-and-5%-mod vs 10%-mod would be ~94.24% uptime. Some classes are definitely awful for seaweed (ele has a ton of self-roots) while others are a piece of cake. I personally average around ~97-98% seaweed uptime on guard, so old seaweed would still be slightly better for me in this hypothetical scenario.
---
I was banned for flaming twice and both times I would get a [ticket from a GM telling me what exactly I got banned for](https://i.gyazo.com/8fe835f39bbd2b24cba13fb6b3658e66.png), showing the chat log and stuff. My first suspension was 48 hours and second 96, I imagine you'd have to say some interesting stuff to be banned for a week straight away - so not exactly "nothing".
---
&gt; I was the only one on it for the past couple of months
---
so a couple of months ago, someone else was playing on it?
---
As long as no *real* animals were harmed...
---
im not a core gamer, but i remember gem-gold like 90-100gold / 400 gem last year near 6th anniversary, now, checked few minutes ago, we have 177gold/400gem, so its like 30% more expensive with discount than before
---
also for your question: it was around 150-155/400 last few days
---
Nope, never touched it or even got an alert of the account at all.
---
any data how long that discount will be available? week?
---
Never buy from an unofficial 3-party site, but to answer your question so yes.

For reference, here is a list of media reports and testimonies about why G2A and similar sites are really bad both for customers and indie devs:

I just wanna know what I got banned for, and for why I got banned for a full week straight.
---
Sarcasm feels heavy
---
Mom's spaghetti
---
Who knows. But I guess it is.
---
Za warudo!!!

The tech to replicate GW1 features is not there yet
---
I cannot stop laughing XD
---
And u can do emotes. Versatile rock.

I said some shit back when S6 came out regarding the timegate difficulty, and the issues related to Masteries being accidentally locked until the mount was released, instead of hidden and EXP not going towards Spirit Shards as a part of that in PoF maps, and I justified it with a lack of information about the Skyscale being "worth all the effort."
---
I retract any and all of that now that ANet went and re-tuned the acquisition costs and timegates.  Skyscale is love, and it makes exploring all the weird and interesting detail of Tyria that much easier (if you're into that sort of thing).
---
It even makes scene positioning easier for the RP crowd, and helps people keep-up with PvE commander trains moving across interesting terrain, while still being engaging with a pretty fair and engaging resource management mechanic to keep it from being either braindead or useless.
---
The only real question that Skyscale really raises for me is "What are they going to focus on for future development?"  Since the Skyscale is more-or-less the full realization of their ideas on "The joy of movement".
---
so would you call yourself an expert in bitterness?
---
I would call this conversation pointless.  I hope you find what you need.
---
Even eve online? Hell no.
---
You're not wrong but I doubt they consider the specs different from professions enough to care, so 90 instead of 270
---
&gt;37
---
In a row?
---
Yeah... naming them was rough.
---
Welcome to WvW post PoF
---
Ah, thank you very much.
---
Do you know when the week is reset?
---
You and me both. I've been staring at this one for a while....
---
This but unironically.
---
EVERYTIME 2 Squads fighting and another one is on th samee map too we have skill lags. For the last 2 weeks.. i casted f.e 3-4hrs ago a meteor in the middle of an enemy zerg and 15s later i saw the animation and i made 2k damage. 
---
and this is now for the last 2-3 weeks.
---
Are you dumb? Go see league of legends reddit
---
You might try port 443 or 80.

I found that Robin is also a pretty darn good match for dwayna's weapon, although mostly on cloth pieces. But it's a nice cheaper alternative anyway.
---
Then get off your ass and give us something better instead of bitching about it
---
I've read you can use it in pvp, you can do a lot of things while standing on it...
---
...
---
But not in raids...

Which hair color is that? When I was checking for a match for my ele's dwayna's gears I had a pretty hard time deciding and ended up going blonde...
---
Perhaps your own username is their best defense
---
Let’s face it: people only downvote me ‘cause I have a feminist name.
---
That works for a few seconds, then your out of charges/shouts for 20 seconds.
---
yeah that all works when you ask new people with no idea of anything and which do not invest to much in terms of having some idea...people which simply play casual. players which never pvp for competition, players which only follow the commander in wvw like a sheep and never go on voice, let alone know any tactics. players which never or rarly use a outer source to learn something.    
---
meanwhile i have the experience that all the players i know which are completly new to the game and do not have many hours into it hit the same walls i do since the same time.  
---
so yeah, there is a difference between playing a bit invested or just casually. my point still stands which, maybe read my first sentence again.
---
Not supporting your own partner, that pay/recruit people on the side to be able to make a free promotion for your game and entertainment for playerbase. Calling it a hack from Anet perpective is like your typical teenager refusing to eat vegetables and freaking out.
---
Yeah we know that Anet is batshit crazy.
---
Not confused, just making assumptions. Class/spec/profession are all used p frequently and can sometimes be misunderstood. Anyway, I think you need 270 slots. All or nothing (:
---
Zooming in to first person makes em visible only to you, unequipping and re-equipping it again makes it visible to everyone iirc.
---
Do you know how many new people I help learn this game. The big issue is an area of expectation coming in. I'd say I talk to at least 3-5 new players each and every day. The overwhelming majority are lost and casual. That's most people that come to this game. But...there are tons of people who play a lot but don't play hard core. I have a guild filled with them. Not one or two people but hundreds.
---
You still haven't answered my question. How many hours do you have in game?
---
Stop shitting on my parade
---
see, they all play casual. read my fucking first sentence and then think about what i wrote. its not that hard...here i copy it for you again:  
---
&gt;if you search a casual experience, its fine. if you plan to do anything with a bit more invest like pvp, wvw, dungeons / fractals / raids and you are a avid player you gotta have a bad time right now where you get to a point were its not that much fun.
---
laughed way too hard on this
---
But we don't all play casual. There are people in my guild who love T4 Fractals and even raiding. You're still missing the point. They're not ONLY focused on those things, but they do them all. Including WvW and PvP. There a difference between people who do everything and people who do only one thing exclusively as their only game. If you're doing everything you're more likely to be happy.

I am playing with a 1080 ti, ryzen 7 1700, and 16Gb ddr4-3200; on 1440p i average around 50-70 fps (excluding places like lions arch bank or world bosses of course), and only that low because of the single core performance on my cpu. You should be more than fine :)
---
And what would this 'playerbase' look forward to once they all reach endgame? Retire in Queensdale and talk to newbies?
---
Sweet! 
---
But I mean the 1080 ti is still quite the beast my dude 
---
The 1070m is on par with a 1660!
---
Even newer cards struggle to beat a 1080 ti
---
If I could get one new I would.
---
Probably your mmr change?
---
It’s you getting pwned.
---
Youll be earning exalted keys if you choose the auric adventurer thing from the first grand exalted chest. I dont think it's enough for permanent sustain there but it is definitely enough for the grands and greats
---
Yeah my card is fantastic! Best retail therapy ive ever done after my ex cheated on me lol. And i multitask so the ryzen is worth it over an intel. Just advertising that your fps should be even higher with an intel cpu and newer gpu :)
---
This so much. Even back in the days too. When the legendary armor first launched, I was just returning to the game, and has not killed Deimos, nor even attempted it. BUT, big BUT, I watched the Youtube video of a kill and made sure I knew the mechanics, which is not hard at all as a DPS (it was ranged), and explained it nicely to the squad lead. I was accepted into it and I got the kill in the end, 1 shot.
---
My daredevil build is the best combination of damage and survival that I can have for my particular playstyle. It is the evolution of about 1000 hours of rigorous testing. It is my meta but you will not find it anywhere should you search for a dd meta.
---
Meta builds are fine if you want a shortcut to a starting point but it is more fun to do the research yourself.
---
I dont have a problem with metas...  just with players who think that they are the end-all.
