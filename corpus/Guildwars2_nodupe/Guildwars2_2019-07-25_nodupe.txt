that just means "We used a random number generator to select accounts."

Do remember every acc has a number.

Yes, getting to endgame is the point,  but ff XIV is SOOOO boring before endgame it's nearly impossible to get there
---
- Traps can be hard dodged = They are useless
---
- Your camera shake and holding down of your "backwards" key (back peddling) tells me you don't play much competitive 
---
- The amount of times 3 players are spamming on a downstate person tells me this is Silver at best
---

---
Calling your channel "PvP Builds" as a generic title gives off the wrong implication of actual game knowledge. I'm sorry but this is a poor representation of the potential of this game's PvP ability.
---
Easy as a mordrem combat tonic. Could even be part of the gem store.
---
Too bad ArenaNet hates money.
---
Let's not forget about beards.
---
BEARDS.
---
ah thx got it confused for a sec because it uses the distortion icon
---
Ah thanks. Maybe i should do a power build instead.  Would the best spec be herald for that? Or can renegade go power too &gt;.&gt;
---
Low effort, sure. but "Not enjoyable content"? If you seriously can't enjoy the Queen's Gauntlet you're *incredibly jaded*. Doing it on different classes with different gambits(especially crowd favorite) is a fucking blast.

Arenanet's spacebar must be broken...

Gw2 has sell itself as a casual mmorpg since the beginning. People just want to log in and do some achievement, some wvw, some Open world event and pvp. They log in for 1 or 2h and play a little with their friends. That's the majority of the gw2 community, this sub doesn't represent the majority of the people that really play the game. I absolutely loved HoT, and i loved the more "mmo" approach that they were going for, but people need to accept that this were not going to be the general direction of the game. They tried, it didn't work, and that's it.
---
Both Gaile Gray &amp; Rubi are terrible at social media.  I mean no disrespect by this, but but they both took/take a very passive role in public relations.  It's great that we have a wholesome community with arts and crafts, but the fundamental is this.  G**W2 is an MMORPG -- it's meant for gamers, therefore if you want to be successful you need good, sustainable strategies for relating to your community.**  
---
Gaile came from an age where her concept of "interaction" was in-game discussion in Guild Wars 1.  In the days before social media it was super wholesome to see her and Mr. Frog.  She never really adapted to modern technology and trends.  Don't get me wrong, I played GW2 12,000 hours and I ran into Gaile Gray maybe 2-3 times.  I know a lot of people really liked her, but all she really seemed to do was moderate the forums and host arts &amp; craft sessions.  I think Rubi is a little better with "Guild Chat,"
---
... but even Rubi isn't harnessing the power of social media.  Even if you sort by controversial @ Bex's profile her comment karma goes down to like ~ negative 100 at the most? *She communicates consistently and well.*  Rubi's Guild Chat initiatives are *good* but my overall consensus is that I would have genuinely suggested they attend some classes or seminars on the advantages and disadvantages of social media.  Social Media isn't something that you win by taking passive tones or roles.  
---
The PC gaming community consists of mostly above-average technology literate generations.  We have a solid understanding of the advantages of being able to do quick, surprise announcements via platforms like Facebook, Twitter or even Instagram.  The reality is that both Gaile and Rubi rely far too much on passive, inorganic interactions that really don't successfully relate to the majority of their community.  **The last thing players want from a community liason is someone they cannot relate to.**
---
This speaks to my reality.  Raiding is small team focused.  I enjoy it most when learning an encounter with a mostly static team. Guilds with a lack of interest and completely incompatible schedules left me uninterested in trying.  As well, the main reward other than fun would be things to let me engage in a lengthy process to craft shiny glow armor. That’s not a motivator for me, personally. 
---
What does motivate me are events like DS was at one time, where folks would tag up and lead the ordinals, or teq before everyone knew it well and stopped trying to organize.  Even SW was fun fir a long time before it became RIBA. 
---
Give me challenging open world content that requires community leadership, and I’ll participate.
---
Same with their WvW streams. It is great to be able to directly talk to devs for a few others but damn.. they are *terrible* at the game.
---
There isn't a meta power DPS build for revenant but you can go [alacrity renegade](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/alacrity/) or [heal renegade](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/heal/). Both builds cover the need for alacrity in 5 and 10 man groups and should be paired with a quickness firebrand (or boon thief for the fights that allow it). The meta right in in every fractal and almost every raid is to bring one alacrity renegade. PUGs will still run (double in raids) chrono often so it might be a little hard to get the correct comp but it's becoming more popular especially since dragonhunters can run quickbrand with little to no gear changes. I'd suggest checking out [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) on where to get diviner and harrier gear (it's a lot easier now). If you're not set on revenant there are a lot of cheap and easy to gear power DPS builds that have easy rotations (Daredevil, Deadeye, Warrior, Berserker, Dragonhunter, Quickness Firebrand, even Reaper isn't that bad)
---
Wouldn't a reasonable alternative just be "suck=kick" type groups? Idk, I remember having better luck with pugs not asking for KP, but I barely raid anymore, so maybe it's changed.
---
I’m so hyped for New World. My friend played in the beta and said it was amazing.
---
[deleted]
---
I relate to this on a spiritual level
---
Apparently, for some people, yes.
---
I wonder if even Amazon's budget is enough to prevent the need for the game to have microtransacations
---
I just filled it out. I took me a really long time because I wanted to spend as much time giving well thought out comments as I would hope they would invest into really reading and considering the feedback. 
---
I think they covered quite a few things that would give them a relatively good picture of how I feel about things. Lots of space to free-text responses and get what you want in, and it gave some insight on how they quantify/categorize the game into its different parts.
---
The reason why more new people aren't flowing into raids after wing 7 is because it doesn't present itself as easy
---
The throne of Adashim can intimidate new players
---
The fact that Qadim supposedly came back "bigger and better" (although in reality he's pretty easy) also intimidates new players
---
Overall the wing seems like it's hard. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's easier than wing 4, but I would put it as the second easiest, just after wing 4
---
Uh, there was a count as to how many were donated to each 5? minute session.  If you don't even know that much about the event, I'm not going to bother talking with you anymore.
---
lol
---
Okay.  I want you to go back and read what I said, and then keep reading it till you realize that I wasn't talking about the evening versus the rest of the day, as I was talking about the start of the event, versus the end of the event, which was about a week long.
---
Head up, mine went to spam!
---
Exactly. GGG of Path of Exile makes some serious mistakes sometimes, but I can't remember a single instance where they didn't follow up in a timely manner with written apology from the game director saying 'we messed up, here's what led us to the mistake, and here's what were implementing right now to fix it'. An apology is meaningless on its own, but it doesn't have to be left like that.
---
Nah man if I want good PvP I'd play games like LoL, CS:GO or even WoW BfA.
---
Even assuming that only 1% will respond to mails, it's [more than 15k responses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ag66tz/gw2_population_right_now/ee4jxuq/), assuming that they will send mails only to people who play \~1hour per week since release. It's impossible to get any data from such database other than simple statistics that they mostly already have just from tracking player activity in game. Not even mentioning how insane would be sending 1.5kk+ e-mails in short enough span, so people getting them last would already have them in their inboxes when the first posts on reddit happen.
---
Speaking of Anet not being able to deal with Twitch Memes. A ton of my emotes are actually blacklisted in their chat. [Here's the answer I got from Arenanet themselves in Twitch Chat, that is completely absurd.](https://i.imgur.com/7iBe0N1.png)
---
Twitch emotes aren't just allowed to be whatever they want. There's a process where they are reviewed to find out if they are offensive, racist, ect. The emotes I use are just goofy shit and are banned in their chat because apparently they're "disruptive". Even worse is that they do not have a list of which ones aren't allowed anywhere, so in my case, you have to test them all or use just 1 and hope you don't get auto timed out for 10 minutes by their bot.
---
It's pretty yikes man.
---
Haven't been keeping up with content releases and updates but iirc when the game first released they promised that they wouldn't change the level cap or release new gear to invalidate your old gear and progress so I don't think they would've added a new tier of runes and sigils making everyone's current runes and sigils obsolete.
---
Yeah Signet share is really strong!
---
I get 80-90% Quickness uptime on my Team with that Memestrel Build, no need for Harrier or the Shout. You overcap hard on Boonduration running full Harrier in fractals.
---
You might wanna start logging your own encounters to check on that.
---
Isnt the MF food the one with Concentration?
---
Taken from the [Guild Wars 2 Tumblr account](https://guildwars2.tumblr.com/post/186523414643/legendary-upgrades-are-coming-soon-powerful-and).
---
Why are they all expanded like that (i.e. FULL descriptions rather than just names with a hover tooltip)? Why are there no categories? Why is there no searchbar?
---
I think one of their problems is that they have overused death or shallow/unexplained departure of characters to remove them. they haven't explored creative ways  (for them) of giving fanfare to a characters exiting in gw2, so whenever one goes it hardly surprises anybody. only mixup we've had is aurene (probably) actual departure from being an active character in the story after the last season  even that one wasn't too surprising
---
Is it 24 hours of play time or real time? If play time like the celebration boosters you should easily get a few days out of it which is fair IMO. Besides you'd be going to the guild hall every day anyway for the free gathering nodes no?
---
You can't bear every group of players / everything in mind when making jokes, memes etc. 
---
Whenever you make a joke or criticize a certain behavior, there will always be people who not do this. So you will always have people who potentionally feel offended. 
---
OP made a general meme, without addressing any certain group. Whether it's critic or a joke, I think in those cases you shouldn't feel addressed if you have nothing to do with it. 
---
If you have a raid group that is fine, everything is fine, not? And if you have a group that do exactly what OP talked about, the critic is justified. That's what I think about it.
---
Easy modes in raids: 
---
* Put the console from the training area next to every ley rift
---
* Give yourself every boon and buff the game has to offer
---
* Boons can't be removed, including the boon strip at the start of every encounter
---
* Reduce boss hp by 33% and breakbars by 50%
---
* CM adds mechanics, EM removes mechanics. No Sabetha canons, no xera bubble, no deimos oneshot, no SH flesh golem
---
Boom, easy modes done. Aegis application maybe once every 20 seconds or so.
---
Bonus points if this kills the raid selling scene by giving LI to easy modes.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-review/
---
read this review and note the negative things the author mentions line up with the things I cited. You can google any number of reviews and they will all say the same things about HoT. The "general feeling" in the game journo community (and a lot of the low skill player community) was that HoT was 1. too hard 2. too complicated and 3. too grindy. I was definitely not pulling this assessment out of my ass.
---
Me and some guild mates tried to do a raid once. After a couple hours dying to the anomaly thing we gave up and I've not tried again since.
---
I did some hardcore reading in my wow days, but I'm not really looking to relive that. So yeah, I'm definitely a casual player with virtually no interest in raids.
---
It IS accurate.
---
Have to agree here.
---
eh stopped playing again.  gonna try legend of aria next
---
When grinding something gives you a ridiculously low g/h reward like 30s/h, while other things give &gt;15g/h, then no. You are wrong. This is in essence timegating the rewards.
---
Ofc, other games dont do this. In other games you get a decent baseline reward for doing endcontent and the bonus loot is just that... a bonus. GW2 however puts nearly all rewards - upfront - into the timegated reward chest, making voluntary repeating (not even grinding! just repeating) anything extremely unprofitable and in some cases (raids and non-farm fractals) you have to actually dip into your funds to just buy proper food.
---
No clue where from you got this weird idea of timegating only being timegating when it directly blocks you from breezing through content via cooldown on specific accountbound items/achievements/events. But even then, since - as you yourself pointed out - gold&amp;currency farming IS the endcontent in GW2, anything that gives way less than optimal rewards due to cooldown on possible rewards is in fact, blocking progress. It is timegated.
---
And to add insult to injury, there ARE things that dont have a timegate in GW2. That you can farm. But those things are so laughably easy to do, they are barely above the level of an idle game - heck, even a clicker game requires more "skill".
---
So not only are rewards timegated in GW2, they are also highly unfairly distributed. Basically, to make an effort in GW2 translates into slower progress.
---
Anet turned this game into a mandatory to-do list to repeated every day. To progress in the "endcontent", you arent allowed to stray from that to-do list too much. Not doing a daily reward, or repeating something, both results in a severe loss in potential rewards. You want to raid for fun - after fullclearing already? Ofc you can do that. Tough only that you miss out on all the other timegated rewards then. Oh and you can only use cheap food with max. 15s costs. 
---
In short: playing GW2 for fun results in 0 progression. Stick to your daily/weekly to-do list or suffer the consequences!
---
I address this entire post in the video. I explained how shortly after Mike O took over game director a patch shipped which by all intents "saved the game" by fixing Fractals and also all the biggest problems of HoT.
---
They tried that. Community cried it was too hard so they gutted any difficulty that couldn't be facerolled in soldiers gear.
---
I see what you did there.
---
If there's something SquareEnix is well known for, it's for having bitchin' story usually. Final Fantasy games are iconic.
---
It looks way better that the stat select interface.
---
Because GW2 UI is awful, and changing the UI usually breaks the game. So anet doesnt change much, only as much as absolutely needed -&gt; UI stays ugly, unwieldy and still breaks the game.
---
Ty for clarifying. Sorry my rant was more at Anet than you. I didn't watch the last 3-4 mins of your video so maybe this is already answered but.. 
---
Is there any reason they can't do some kind of tier system basically building on CMs? So they can re-use content without pulling it down for people who want the challenge. That could open it to fairly casual players who want to be able to join an lfg and expect to probably beat a boss they don't know within a couple tries. Lower rewards and put unique rewards on higher tiers but still reward actual currency for the low mode. Best of both worlds. Opens possibility of harder tiers too.
---
Literally what the fuck do you even mean? Are you saying Queensdale is timegated because it's 30 silver per hour while Dragonfall is 30 gold per hour? How the does that even make sense? That's just a difference in efficiency of farming gold you goober.
---
It's like you think any time you spend playing is a timegate but it's less of a timegate if you get more gold per hour. I don't know what else to say but nice chatting with you and good luck with whatever it is you're doing man!
---
The main problem is that these kind of memes often massively overblow the toxic population in the raiding scene, leading to people not wanting to try out raids. This directly affects me and my ability to enjoy the game in LFG. So I must speak up about it. 
---
He very well could have included a note that this was a one off case he encountered previously and the majority of raiders arnt assholes right after posting. 
---
OP instead only explains the joke after someone calls him out on trying to promote infighting in the community. I strongly disagree with promoting infighting between communities, no matter if it is a meme or not.
---
&gt;I think what many viewers who may not be familiar with Nike is that he is part of the hardcore community, and so his opinions of the game are based on that. I bring this up because it is vital to the context of the whole video. This is, for example, why his commentary labels the "successful" parts of the game as the harder, challenging content, rather than what ANet seemingly values, which are accessible content that is more likely to bring in more money.
---
GW2 launched with the intention of being a hardcore sPvP game and more importantly HoT was designed as a hardcore open world and group content expansion. Therefore Nike's viewpoint is 100% legit, justifiable and to be taken seriously. The downgrade in difficulty comes from Anet trying to please online journalists who all don't have a fucking clue how to play the game.
---
Ok, now split them into two stacks of n and m and spam both again. Quickly, ofc.
---
Not every commander would be that paranoid on every player, and there is some % of % of fakers who will slip through and then some % of those who won't show themselves kick-worthy in the actual raid/fractal and will get their kill, but it doesn't mean that people shouldn't even try to filter pugs.
---
And if there were better ways to check people, no one would ask to ping kp. But by not introducing such ways a-net only hurts community and raises general paranoia level.
---
You don't know what (presumably) clicking in to change it looks like though?
---
&gt; A ton of my emotes are actually blacklisted in their chat.
---
Good. Riddance.
---
It's not an NDA as much as a request.  I don't see why the request shouldn't be respected given this outreach for feedback.
---
It got very good reviews the first month.
---
Instead of sending these surveys Anet just should gather and dedicate 15 minutes to listening to the video currently sitting on the top of the frontpage here.
---
Hopefully we will be able to get these via WvW and spvp.
---
All its problems were kinda timegated, except class design that was garbo from the start of the expac.
---
I’m not sure the amazon thing is a success. A lot of it is being scrapped and moved over to a Lord of the Rings mmo.
---
Apparently shb is one of the best ffgames in years when it comes to story, it even puts alot of sp games to shame.
---
This comment thread is a mess. All he did was say 'made' instead of 'taken' and y'all are going on a rant about artistic integrity lmao. Stop taking everything so seriously and literally.
---
Not from my own doing believe me.
---
Whoever did use them enough to get blacklisted must have done some crazy shit because they're all just memes.
---
PoE has a lot of good things going for it, but still has two main issues.
---
1. The skills system is horrendously confusing for new players.
---
2. It looks like trash.
---
&gt; He very well could have included a note that this was a one off case he encountered previously and the majority of raiders arnt assholes right after posting. 
---
Well, we don't know. Maybe OP tried out raiding via lfg only one time, with exact this experience.
---
Seen this so often now
---
"Colin i leaving anet to spend more time with his family" is corporate speak for fired.
---
it'd take a few seconds to change this into what they want.
---
And as someone who raids nonstop i tend to leave when commanders act that way because big chance they are garbage.
---
But more to the point, asking KP or LI is not to eliminate something totally, just lower the amount of noobs that join so it works. People that fake kill proof care enough and higher chance they know more than those ppl that just join with 0 clue and hope they'll just get carried.
---

Idk, didn't quite seem like it...
---
Hmm ... are we getting legendary infusions as well?
---
the desert borderland is what made it bleed wvw players even further. all 3 maps were desert, first iteration all barricades around areas so if trying to get somewhere by yourself and small group was a pain. that and the keep areas were troublesome to navigate as well.
---
&gt; favourite system
---
templates!
---
Well, we will never know. But I def stand by speaking up for my fellow nice willed raiders against this kind of generalizing and fear mongering.
---
Yep they take an event that could be good when applied to the right reward in the game and use it to give access to a system that should be a base change to the game not reliant on an event.
---
This is the downside of not employing anyone with a bit of common sense. Although what is more likely is that someone already told them that this sucks but they ignored it.
---
Presumably because its reliant on an event that is essentially completely irrelevant to the system and is simply an artificial method of manipulating the economy around runes and sigils.
---
i ping my fuzzy wuzzy bear :D
---
Have they said they want to water raids down? I seem to recall when discussions about easy and story modes came up they said they didn’t want to make raids easier, or offer easier versions. But rather they wanted a sort of flat level of difficultly across the board. Like a sort of difficulty band they are aiming for.
---
I agree, I am currently working on my skyscale, most of it was quite fun and I had a blast doing it, but the few other parts were just horrible grindy and just ruined the overall experience. The meat part was me coming online, making a crystal, making it food, feeding, logging off. For about 1-2 weeks? Now I am on the saddle, which is me, coming online, farming one map completly, logging off again, and doing that around 3-4 times for one map, for about 4 maps (I got lucky and had some resources left over), so around 15 days of just logging in, doing 1 thing, logging off. 
---
And I din't even wanna remember the draconis mons backpack /shudder
---
It really seems like anet comes up with a good idea for a collection, plans it out as a real fun adventure, and then when they are finished they notice it doesn't take much time as they thought it would be, but they only have 1 day to make changes, so they just randomly stuff in doing the same things over and over and over for multiple days so they can say "hey boss, we fixed this, it now takes 10 more days to finish it".
---
[Anet:](https://i.imgur.com/Pc47yhO.jpg)
---
For normal people you really just spam 11111 in story or open world, most casuals however cant even be bothered to do that and fail living story...
---
Alot of players (including me) will agree with you on the points about difficulty, both of instances story content and open world events.
---
To be honest I enjoyed the PoF/LS4 maps far more than general consensus seems to believe, and spend alot of time in them for achievements/armor/collections but if that doesn't interest you or you are more efficient than me I get that.
---
&gt; But I'll wager the casual population is high enough to keep the game going for a long long time.
---
Its been that way for a long time and a lot of people hate to accept that. GW2 just isn't a hardcore game.
---
There's something right about what is said here, but in the broad sense I don't think it's correct.
---
Yes, you're right that if you simply survey everyone and take all of the responses that you are going to have results with some types of players over-represented (although there is also something to be said for this, as those who responded would probably be the people most invested in the game and so the people you most need to keep happy). 
---
On the other hand, I believe it's wrong that the only way or that the best way to avoid this would be to sample only a selection from each of the group types you have managed to identify. This still has the potential to lead to over-representation of some groups for reasons similar to those already noted. Rather, it makes more sense to send the survey to everybody and see what the response rate is for your different groups. You can then either weight the samples of each group in the right way to to even out the representation or you can randomly sample from the groups with a higher response rate in order to create a sample of the same size as you have from the smaller groups, or you do some combination of the two. This has the advantage of giving the largest possible fair sample while also giving you data about which groups are more likely to respond, which can be helpful. 
---
Now, if the reason you want a selection rather than surveying everyone is because you are trying to keep what you're asking about secret, then that makes perfect sense for doing this sort of thing.
---
I would move to eso for FF14 but their combat suck.
---
random shit is what makes encounters fun. else it comes down to a boring rota shitfest as it is already with most bosses.  
---
if you mean the instabs, they are just as a mechanic shitty designed. the aetherfield or tentacles are nice for example...random and you have to react.
---
I disagree on a couple of points.
---
Firstly, a design intent to allow for hardcore sPvP does not inherently mean that the game, and subsequently its balance, needs to be designed solely for that niche. To do so alienates a large potential player base. To bring up a successful example is League of Legends. The game is easy enough to pick up and play, has a decently high skill ceiling, and its esports side is unquestionably popular. However, Riot Games understands that they cannot simply bend to the whims of the pro-scene, and still have to cater for more casual players. This has allowed them to keep the game accessible, but still with lots of room for players to express their skill.
---
Secondly, I never questioned the legitimacy of Nike's viewpoint. Rather, I simply wanted to point out the context of his viewpoint. His views are by all means valid, but so are those of the more laid-back parts of the community. I suppose the frustration stems from the fact that ArenaNet has signaled their preference for the latter, and I simply can't fault them for that. It is their decision to choose how they want to steer their game, and ours to decide if it is something we can agree enough to stick with. If this leads ArenaNet to financial ruin, then they simply need to change course promptly. Until then, if the numbers still support their decisions, who's to tell them differently?
---
Right, HoT, as good as it was (and I love it to this day) didn't help the game, it hurt the game. It brought in a lot of hard core players at the expense of casual players, who at that time did represent the bulk of the population. It's why Anet used a quarterly update to make HoT more friendly to solo players at one point. It's why there was a thread on the official forums that said this game is no longer for casuals that lasted for months.  I don't mind harder content, but I accept that I"m in no way representative of the majority.  In fact, I'm sort of a tweener. I'm too good for easy stuff but I'm probably not hard core enough for the harder stuff, so I get the worst of both worlds.  But that's my issue since no MMO has ever been able to cater to my needs.
---
I said the game was intended to be a hardcore sPvP game and you still talk about niche. Are you kidding me?
---
I've been playing Condi ranger/SB since HoT. I find the rotation of condi to be much more satisfying, but you will not have as much fun in fractals/raids with it. It takes a while for your damage to ramp up, and you have to be in melee for optimal damage. I'm not the best at it, though, only hitting 28k or so dps on dummies, but there's my view on it.
---
The survey only opens if you agree not to share the details of it's questions - or your answers - with anybody.  I'm tempted to post my screenshots of it, though.
---
Why is this the first I'm hearing of the EXISTENCE of a runecrafter's salvage-o-matic? Good grief.
---
I dunno what any of the questions said, I just kept writing "Capes!"  
---
(j/k)
---
Mine was, too. Folks who didn't receive an email need to check this folder!
---
Check your promotions folder, if you have one!
---
OP should mention that folks who 'didn't' receive one should check their 'promotions' folder, as it went there instead of 'updates' or 'inbox'.
---
Seems pretty small to me for 11 million accounts.
---
nothing, but thank you
---
Yes they are.
---
Definitely get into the raids! They're quite challenging, and they're where i spend most of my focus working towards. So far I've killed 5 bosses and I'm loving the raid scene. Raids are what it's all about for me, but i came here from WoW so maybe that's why.
---
So basically the fucked up, the poaching is normal, but it wouldn't be a big of a scale unless Anet was trash company to work in.
---
1. Anet and promoting their game. Yeah, not a good combo. Same with with wing 7. That map trailer of the key of ahdashim was boring. To be honest, I don't remember anything about the wing 6 reveal.
---
2. I don't think bounties scale that bad, it's just too many people not pressing their buttons. My bigger complaint is that those bosses do nothing other than having annoying mechanics. The worst combo is high mobility bosses with the circle around them where you have to go either ranged or quite close.
---
I don't share the confidence you do with how they are selecting even if random (which I don't think it is). But who knows, maybe it is random. Apparently this isn't a new thing either but this is the first I've heard about it and I've never received one myself in all the years I've been playing this game
---
Thank you!
---
Because you live under the rock like me, obviously
---
[&amp;AgGt8QBAuV8AAA=] I'd link something like this
---
no one wants to wipe over and over until you have 10 decent players in the squad, kp/li/titles is a logical if not perfect way of filtering out most of the dead weight before you enter combat.
---
Can't help it! https://youtu.be/wsWiqvC06ds
---
I'd love to have some wilted flowery stuff and maybe some goopey tar stuff for an Awakened Sylvari!  
---
That being said, Caithe's brand is supposed to be special... she poured a lot of love and effort into the egg and later Aurene even if it was a bit misguided.  All we did was come take it from her and shove it in a golden glowy spiral thing so we could bark orders at her when she finally hatched.
---
Thats why I only play GW2 when there's new main story scenarios. I don't mind supporting the crew with 30-60 bucks per expansion but as a game, as a whole, it sucks. One of the big things that keep me playing a game is grinding for gears-through leveling, farming, raids, etc...unfortunately GW2's gear/weapon designers suck. It sucks..horrendously. My motivation level dropped into the negatives. If you want a REAL game where the devs and the crew will actually give a sh! about you you should try FFXIV. THIS is my main game and we just got a new expansion..pretty good stuff so far. They friggin LISTEN to the community...i think a while back some dingbat raised some random question and the developer was like "yeah we'll look into that.." i think they followed through with the suggestion too.  Also this game have two big things that I look forward to the most...story and gears-the gears are soo damn cool! The game gives you a free trial. After that you have to sub for 14 bucks or less depending on how long you'll stay. I've gladly been paying my subs. Just saying, if you like GW2 keep it but if it's dying on you go play other games and come back when an expansion arrives. That's what I've been doing. Same for SWTOR. Didn't uninstall it.
---
As a GW1 player I have a different perspective:  
---
Over here! = 1 Ping on the map  
---
Are you there? = 1 Ping on the character in question  
---
WTF ARE YOU DOING GTF OVER HERE RN = Angry ping spam  
---
This way! = A line on the map marking the path   
---
You're going the wrong way WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU! = angrily scribbled line  
---
Bored = Pentagram, boobs, penis, swastika, or other such sketched on the mini map  
---
You didn't skip a cutscene fast enough = The monk left the party  
---
Your warrior used Sprint and died on the other side the map from the rest of the group = Diarrhea of the keyboard
---
Various African-themed hair styles and new facial features which they added on top of the normal human stuff in character creation for free.
---
You know that you can drop a game withouth having to make a big deal out of it or write a whole testament about it
---
All of the Elonian faces and hairstyles became available.
---
Can’t afford the sub tho unfortunately. I’m dead broke
---
In exchange for gold
---
I mean when you’re done
---
I’m fine with it being focused on open world stuff as long as that open world stuff is decently challenging. As it stands rn, the game is very, VERY simple when it comes to the open world maps.
---
Maybe.
---
i ask for role, cuz i want to update my lfg damnit &gt;:|
---
Yup, it's reddit.  r/Guildwars2 and r/FuturamaSleepers is all I do here.  Everything else is on Voat.
---
You're right, it was a co-op online tactical rpg. :)
---
They have been sending this email for 7 weeks already. It wasn't known for everyone because they want it confidential. Stop treating anet like bs company.
---
I'm finding some new stuff with each episode. You seem to think people want new all the time. New mechanics. Harder mechanics, more challenging mechanics. Some of that is fine. Some of it I get from doing some of the harder living world achievements. The griffon time trials are hard for a lot of people.  Some of the achievements from stories are challenging if you don't cheese them (there are plenty of ways to cheese them). 
---
At the end of the day, I'm just not sure most people play games for challenge. Some people log in to blow off steam after a day of work and just kill shit and the last thing they want to is have to learn new stuff all the time. For better players that obviously means the game gets stale. For people who aren't better or aren't as dedicated to the mechanics, it's a different story.
---
A lot of people play games like this for immersion rather than mechanics. A lot of mechanics ruin the game for me, because it's the opposite of immersion. I prefer non boss fights off, with big battles raging, because I'm reacting rather than thinking about a rotation. Makes me feel more like I'm in the middle of a pitched battle.
---
Also the game is harder if you're not looking up builds and you're just winging it without a whole lot of research.  Much harder. I've seen people fail stuff I think is piss easy because they simply don't understand how to play.  Unfortunately that's probably a fair percentage of the population.
---
Though I've never done a fractal CM, my factal level is 97 and I've done a tiny bit of raiding, but mostly just the escort. A bit of time spent on Kairn and the Veil Guardian. That's how I know I don't enjoy it.
---
I loved HoT at release. You weren't the only one.
---
tl;dr: Game Journos and Amazon's fault.
---
But [Xera's Mask was a drop](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Xera%27s_Mask_(Xera_Backpiece_skin). Oh you want to put that mask on your face? Silly you, that's not what masks were made for. (Unless you give us money of course)
---
Sounds like it. Damn the relationship Bungie has worked to develop with DTG is kinda beautiful, good times and bad. Wish more studios did that.
---
Firebrand + scourge, meta since PoF release and literally mandatory in sPvP tournaments. I’m not joking, unless you are a 5 billion iq pvp lord who’s been theorycrafting your team for eons, just play firebrand scourge and faceroll over everyone. Scourge has so many goddamn corrupts and aids condition applications (burning and torment for damage but more annoyingly endless applications of cripple), while firebrand brings ridiculous amounts of aoe stability and small aoe heals, allowing the scourge to freecast on mid and never die while aoe spamming the entire enemy team. Nothing can displace this combo if performed correctly other than 2 better players doing the same thing and/or 3 burst holosmiths/heralds
---
Aye, agreed. Mine went to "promotions" as well.
---
I had a failure 3 days ago.
---
I can relate to that, but it all comes down to communication and signaling, and that's something I consider one of ArenaNet's larger weaknesses.  They might ask for criticism, but they seldom if ever follow up and uncertainty isn't a fulfilling emotion.  
---
I think a lot of the disconnect stems from an inability to find entertainment and immersion in content devoid of mechanics.  I've actually always encouraged my friends to break their rotations if they think it'll provide beneficial gains for party or squad members.  I think the "average" raiding experience and the "hardcore" raiding experiences are more flexible than people would have you believe.  
---
Kairn &amp; VG aren't particularly interesting fights in my opinion.  I think they're fairly well-designed, but they're not very exciting. I did about ~ 6 months worth of CMs to re-earn the relics I needed for Fractal God; I think that those fights are very structured and mechanically interesting, but their difficulty varies in direct proportion to how fast your phase times are.  That can make them very frustrating to both teach and learn.    
---
Do you remember Bloodstone Fen's Unbound Guardian meta? You'd descent into the crater fight a bunch of Jade Bosses and then descent to the cavern floor to fight a Vale Guardian replica? I like that sort of progression that leads up to a boss with a few simple mechanics like the blue teleport circles, the green damage enhancing circles -- that sort of a thing.  Nothing fancy.  I think that the game would benefit from more simple, intuitive, well communicated and perhaps even optional mechanics.
---
That is still something you can do it on your own, considering it.
---
Dont get me wrong I dont want to be mean to you but this kind of stuff is quite unecessary, it is a game.. Nowadays there is a bunch of posts made about Gw2 refugees in FF and what not, people can just drop a game in silence, its not illegal.
---
The sad part is there is a Normal Mode and Hard Mode in the original Guild Wars. Thye would have to double up on the instances for GW2. But it would be a good thing imo.
---
It *is* better than the drop down menu of stats... Hopefully legendary stat swap moves to this as well.
---
It's still terrible overall because you have to scroll so swapping rune types will likely be incredibly tedious
---
[What's awaiting you after core Tyria.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQvSbjjFvCY)
---
This is using Qualtrics, a major statistics tool that costs money to maintain a subscription to. It's unlikely that they're doing this just to cool things off.
---
No survey for me :X
---
I suspect that Anet had the same mindset in regards to skill balancing. There's a vast disparity in what can be achieved when you compare players who understand game mechanics and lean into them and players who don't. Many of the balance changes made by Anet seemed designed to close that gap by introducing low effort, high impact abilities. Want boons and support? Take a Firebrand, mash your keyboard, nobody dies. Want damage? Take this condi Mirage, mash your keyboard and rack up 40 stacks of confusion and torment in a few seconds.
---
Anet took a knowledge/tutorial problem, treated it like a balance problem and it's had severe effects on the game. I've seen so many players drop out of the WvW and PvP scene because the game stopped being fun to play. It's devastating for the community because once players start quitting it has a knock on effect where it leads to more players quitting because all their friends left. It feels bad to log on, check your friend list or guild roster and see two people online when you used to see sixty. I don't think Anet truly understand game communities and how integral they are to the ongoing health of an MMO. They scrapped their guild team, they barely support WvW, raiding or difficult open world content. All of which are areas of the game that encourage social, group interaction. They should be the lifeblood of an MMO but they're barely even considered. People generally don't stick around playing a game for seven years because they give a damn about Dragons And The Magic Crisis In Tyria. They stick around because it's where their social group is, and if there's very little for that group to do together, they're just going to wander off and I don't think Anet understand this.
---
I agree with pretty much all of what you said in the video. It's hard to deny the truth that Anet's attempts to make the game more casual result in short term financial gain but cause serious issues within the community that could severely impact the longevity of the game going forward.
---
I know the outfits don't look alike, it's not a cosplay
---
It took them *soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo* long to update bounties. And it's really, really sad because I feel PoF maps are great to look at, interesting and well-designed. And it took them two years to update bounties to make them a viable alternative to HoT maps with rewards commensurate with those metas. That's all it took; increasing the drop-rate of elegy mosaics and adding amalgamated gemstones here and there.
---
HoT was overhyped and it lead to drastic backlash when Anet didn’t deliver all that was promised. The first raid wing was released some months after HoT and the promised gen 2 legendary weapons we put on permanent hiatus...and we’re still waiting for all of them years later. This was seen as the biggest betrayal to the player based because the expansion heavily advertised the legendary weapons are the main selling point and only three of them existed at launch.
---
Prior to the expansion, there was a content drought for about 1.5 years and there was literally nothing to do in the game. Speedrunning dungeons were nerfed to oblivion and the only endgame content was Fractals...which hadn’t had a new instance in 2 years.
---
HoT also brought a jarring danger scale that had not been seen before. You can hardly die AFKing anywhere in Tyria, but just getting from point A to point B in HoT was riddled with pocket raptors and ridiculously strong monsters with a ton of CC. This furthered divided players into those who were craving challenging content and others who could not easily adapt to having to raise their base skill level. Adding gliding and multilevel maps were super confusing to navigate and people bitched about Tangled Depths forever. Anet’s communication at this tine was very selective, not transparent, and tone deaf at times. All in all HoT was not considered a good expansion by anyone that first year.
---
Tl;dr - HoT had a lot of amazing things going for it when it launched, but coming from a content drought, not providing a finished product with key advertised features entirely missing, and just poor communication soured the entire experience.
---
Honestly, didnt bother me in the least. Just as it doesnt bother me to have a 3 month break between living stories with cliffhangers.
---
All surveys have to have a sample size. Too large or too small and it's impossible to extract any meaning from the results. They're likely either targeting subsets of the population that they feel are active/knowledgable about the game's issues (for example I've been here since the game went F2P) with an eye to expand if not enough people respond or if they want to target different populations.
---
When I visited the site last week, I got one where all the questions were specifically about improving the site but no questions about the game itself.
---
Until templates finally come, switching your stats on your fuckton of legendaries takes longer than switching a bunch of gear. Legendary Upgrades (runes, sigils) are just another piece on the drop-down pile you have to click through.
---
You get access to all runes :P
---
maybe not everyone has legendary armor, dunno
---
How much do veteran players contribute to revenue though? I've always wondered this. You would think that as a player matures there's less they want to buy and they are so much more better at accumulating gold and therefore gems that offer less than a new player.
---
It wasn't mentioned much, and was only available for one week.
---
They did a bunch of dumb shit that fucked it up regardless of the difficulty:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Changed ascended armor to cost way more due to leather
---
Totally fucked up fractals so people only ran FOTM 40
---
new Wvwvw map listened to reddit and was way too defensive, so you couldn't get fights
---
Old wvwvw map was not usable for months
---
Thats a nice one aswel
---
That's how the World Boss Rush felt. For some "Strange" reason, it hit Tier 5 on the last day of the even being active.
---
Better wait until the broad mass of players starts buying, too. Right now you just farm late hoarders. The real spike comes shortly after release.
---
No one asked you. And what are you talking about.
---
This community makes a mistake, believing it must be either casual content or hardcore content. Anet is big enough to provide content for every mode - story, open world, wvw, pvp, instanced pve. But they dont. They are badly managed and they created toxic to environment where players "compete" for dev resources. This is ridoculous.
---
Same, was able to do it on mobile so that's a plus
---
Yea mean droves as in a vocal minority that creates theses posts just so they can farm karma because this sub reddit is a sad hivemind that jumps on the first bandwagon they see? Then yes.
---
Honestly speaking, Why the fuck would anyone make these? How often do you change your runes and sigils? There's no power creep or ascended runes/sigils either. It seems like something you just make bank off of people who have nothing else to spend gold/resources on...
---
Its such a pain to swap to another build while you have army of alts and dozens of armor/weapon/trinket sets. At least it will free one of my bank tabs from rarely used runes/sigils.
---
They need some kind of app like Yelp for leaving games, so they can all post there , and we don't have to see it.
---
I run Boon duration + Magic find food when you have a Boon (+40%). I can also use rice ball and maintain my 100% duration, but i only use that with really bad instas with teams that are not super good.
---
I use the halloween MF utility (+30%)
---
Feel my wrath is super awesome. i tried the elite mantra and it's pretty meh, does nothing for me. Both stand your ground and hallowed ground i like way more.
---
Also i don't run full Harriers, i run minstrel/Harrier combo for 100% boon duration. My fury and quickness uptimes are way above 100% anyway, but i need the Boon duration for might (and some times protection).
---
Just checked. I got it and filled it out. Thanks for letting us know!
---
They had to care about it , they had sunk many millions into it , and then launched a broken unplayable mess that damaged their reputation and stock prices. They HAD to do what they did, or they would have gone under.
---
 I lived in Japan for a while , and knew a guy who worked for Square in a very junior capacity. By the time those guys are making actual impactful decisions , they don't give a shit about games. As far as they're concerned , making games is the same as selling bulldozers.
---
Aside from guardian, the other 3 classes in question (engi, mes, necro) need to pick very different trait lines based on their condi build or power build, and thus you're **always** significantly better off going full viper or full zerker on them.
---
If you're using a dps meter, you'll notice an easy 30-40% damage increase (minimum) on any of those builds if you switch to viper/zerker and fix your traits accordingly.
---
Guardian is an exception because their condi/power multiplier traits are in the same trait lines.
---
If you answer yes you get a message "Thanks for participating in this survey. Have a nice day." and the survey is over ^^^^^/s
---
Gaile is a perfect example of anet not willing to change. She was a relict of the past and made a lot of damage to anet relations with players. They should getbrid of her before HoT and find someone young and pationate to drive the hype. Gaile is nothing of this.
---
* Waves from AU *
---
I don’t think it’s legality is in question. Abet specifically requested it not be discussed, so as far as r/guildwars2 is concerned, the request is/should be honored.
---
We need this.
---
I play almost solely ranger and found Power Greatsword is a great base to start with. Switch sword/axe to longbow and then tweak the rest of the build to play/perform how you want.
---
Longbow has great burst damage, once burst is over the greatsword provides sustain.
---
[removed]
---
i can agree here with you 100%. a certain druid main we both know aswell ;)
---
Decimate defenses and soul eater are pretty close to one another, around 1k dps apart in benchmarks. Though if you can't always have Fury, decimate defenses will pull out ahead. Since you'll not only be missing out on the out-of-shroud crit cap by not having decimate, but also will only be at ~90% crit in shroud without swapping gear and food around, which will drop your power enough to lower your dps.
---
Since he's asking about open world, low tier fractals and story stuff then he'd probably be better off with decimate defenses since he can apply a large amount of vuln on his own to get the crit chance bonus. And if he's doing low tier fractals or open world stuff with other people around, stuff will almost always have 25 vuln on it but he likely won't be getting any fury.
---
The usual rate for a w1-4 is 750 - 800 MC That's 15 LI so you need it 10 times = 7000MC
---
The time I spent in the original Guild Wars, and therefore my attachment to the universe, is pretty much what keeps me going. I'm one of the people that hopes - with every delay and every period of silence-  that it's because they're working on the thing that's going to make the game live up to its potential. Every gemstore update I hope for new faces and hairstyles. Every balance patch I hope for meaningful changes that add complexity and depth to the combat and encounters. Every twinkling of an expansion I hope we finally get playable Tengu. And every time I'm left waiting, knowing that for some reason the company that made my favorite game of all time can't turn the sequel into something that's deeply engaging or has the features and updates you'd expect from an MMO. If this were any other game I'd have jumped ship a long time ago, but Tyria means too much to me. It's hard to run out of hope, but damn if Anet doesn't try their best to make it happen.
---
I don't even know if I'd *want* Anet to be a company that communicates in "dunk" culture. Maybe it's because I'm slowly reaching the level of an ancient in terms of internet years, but the way some companies engage can be a little too juvenile even if it's amusing. Companies like Riot or Epic (which have shitpiles of drama on them right now unrelated to the games they make, so let's not pretend they're model developers) get away with it because they don't have to prove anything. They're "cool" in the sense that League was the biggest game in the world for years with multi-million dollar tournaments. Epic is "cool" in that Fortnite is an absolute Twitch monster. I feel like Anet trying to adopt that form of communication wouldn't work because they don't have the clout. Any "dunks" they could produce would just be met with people asking them why they're not fixing their dying game. Instead, I feel like Anet wants to be more like a Nintendo with a warm and reassuring presence where people take their word and give them faith because of their history. But they lack any of Nintendo's positives - such as being known for holding themselves to a high standard of quality - and instead embody only the negatives aspects, like being out of touch and not supporting their communities.
---
The sad truth, I think, is that when you take both of these aspects together it seems the reality is that we don't get more communication because there's nothing to communicate. Players don't know where the game is headed because Anet doesn't know either - they're just laying the tracks in front of the train until they run out of track. Being an innovator and a leader in an industry as demanding as MMOs is hard and it seemed like even as quickly as launch Anet lost the ability to maintain a game that requires as much work as GW2. It appears they recently tried to jump ship to other products more within their scope but had nothing to show for it so now they're back on GW2 or bust. Will Guild Wars 2 ever get a new race? Will it ever get consistent cosmetic updates? Will it get consistent, meaningful endgame and hardcore releases? Will it continue to support three very diverse and demanding game modes? These questions are a Schrodinger's box of answers that depend on whether or not they're being measured. If the community asks repeatedly and pointedly about any one feature they may get teased that it is, in fact, being worked on. But as soon as the focus is off it again, if there are no resources to make it happen, it's pulled off the table until the next time it's asked about. Anet can't commit to communication because they can't commit to consistency or content. 
---
So I guess my hope is that one day, some day, before the game eventually dies, we will get some modicum of a game that has consistent releases, of a consistent quality, with a consistent idea of what it wants to be and where it wants to go. If that happens, communication will follow suit, and I think it's pointless, if not hopeless, to wish for anything to change before that. If it sounds defeatist to expect content commitments before communication, then buckle up and join us, because that's been the last seven years for those of us who've been pessimistically optimistic about anything ever changing.
---
Biggest thing is clones/phantasm not spawning
---
Presumably you make an entire set at once. But honestly people swap runes and sigils all the time though most of those who have been in need of something like this already use legendary armors/weapons. Still, I'd slot one into an aquabreather because that's the one piece of gear that can't be reasonably expected to have multiple armor pieces. 
---
Balance patches, especially those that touch stats (ie when banners, EA and spotter were changed to 100's), runes and sigils get swapped in and out all the time during theorycrafting and build testing.
---
If you meant "easier than before patch" then it totally is now because rotation with Shiro+Mallyx is now mostly
---
Swap Leggend --&gt; Activate energy draining skill (Impossible Odds or Embrace the Darkness) --&gt; Use weapon Skills in a certain order until Energy runs out --&gt; Swap Legend
---
They send survey only if you regularly buy gems.
---
It used to give Distortion but it got replaced by an effect called "Blur" that happens to behave exactly like Distortion whith the added benefit of not literally being distortion to avoid potentially broken interactions that this skill could have had with traits like "When you get distortion you group gets distortion for 1 sec" (that got replaced by Aegis some time ago too) for example.
---
They're also possibly working on alliances for WvW btw. See your fix in 9 months big lol.
---
Mate your leader just has a foot fetish.
---
1v1 still happen, if both parties are willing
---
What doesnt happen (as often) anymore is picking of people walking back to their zerg
---
People that want to 1v1 and thus actually fight back will still fight you
---
I would also love more male syl faces that don’t look like they have beard stylings on their chins, too. There are like, only 2 of them.
---
Thats definitely not the same one
---
&gt; with a lot of could-have-beens 
---
Heh
---
Nope, there's an NDA
---
Game has consistently gone down hill since Colin left.
---
Me neither
---
Thank god we have arcdps and its build template function. I don't know how I could live without it and with legendary runes/sigils it will be even more useful.
---
But (official) build templates are on the table, right guys?
---
well, they killed my playstyle, especially in open-pve/meta events.
---
Just look at any GvG tourney vod in guild hall when there's a 45 minute delay to get 40 people into a single map. And heaven forbid if someone jumps into the arena early or good bye.  Or try summoning a trading post in there and crashing everyone in the guild hall to desktop because it can't handle npc's.
---
[Not a terribly big assumption](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Upgrades).  It *could* be wrong, but the timing from when this was uncovered to when legendary runes have been announced is damn convenient.  More likely than not that gift is going to be the gift you need, and prices are already getting expensive.  The price is over 2k now, actually.
---
Of course it's possible said runes are crafted in sets of 6, which would make the price a tad bit more reasonable.
---
With a real sink for them, Lucent Crystals are going nuts even now price-wise.
---
Maybe you should stop thinking that "casuals"  are lobotomised idiots that don't know anything about the game they are playing.
---
It was a bit difficult when going for achis tho. I remember this rock AoE at the ground being hardly visible and hitting it would disqualify you.
---
What are the questions they ask?
---
No, it's not. These emails are not new.
---
Maybe storywise, but if we get another map with 2 hours of content to do..
---
i never said i want a gear treadmill. I only pointed out that, IMO the benefit of having legendary runes is kinda already in the game via legy armor and gemstore/blc upgrade extractor. So why should we undergo this massive goldsink for smth. thats already kinda in the game. I can see ppl crafting them only for the sake of being "full" legendary tho. So its not a cry for a gear treadmill its just me pointing out that they are(if only statselectable without any other effect like cosmetic or sth. of that nature), kinda usless to begin with..
---
And them who like to have a full legendarie main.
---
Get your effing facts right. The **only** promise they didnt delivered were the legendaries. Raid release a few weeks later was communicated well before the hot release and everyone knew it. Also there was no 1.5 year long drought. It was 8 months.
---
well.. gl making new friends.. try to say if you are on NA or EU for others to add you.  
---
About what you say is a bit ackward because you are basicly saying that you take breaks from the game and when you comeback others are taking breaks so it makes hard? ok..
---
It's not. The pvp gear panel is way to trickle and small
---
They also pitched properly scaling mobs but that is still non-existent.
---
You need to share activities for that. PvP/WvW/raids, whatever.
---
Because official build templates. Spent a shit load of money to finally get working build templates after 7+ years of asking. But yes fuck it. Till a normal player has all this finished the game is dead because it needs years.
---
I think the differences are that in other MMOs it was "that easy" to make friends because you were forced to be in a group to do things and therefore found people you connected with and then maybe met up later and start doing stuff together. Now, Guild Wars 2 doesn't force you into groups but finding other players and doing content together hasn't really changed you just have to take on the initiative to do this.
---
You can still look for other players to do things with them like finding a group for fractals, dungeons or even raids. Chatting with them or even joining a guild.
---
I'm not saying that this is easy but if you expect that people will go towards you while you sit in the corner and too afraid to talk to someone then of course you will think that "making friends" is hard.
---
There is always room for someone to "chime in" in a guild, that is what a guild is for and I don't think that anyone will blame you from talking to others. Or, you know, you look for a smaller guild that doesn't has a massive amount of players that barely know each other.
---
Other players frequently makes the UG chain a frustrating experience :/
---
I didn't say I was. Also , fuck you, loud-mouth.
---
Air isn't used? Oh lordy
---
That's not a challenge, that's a waste of time.
---
Air needs to be buffed for even more damage? These are the hot takes I come here for.
---
Not much i believe, but it all depends on your playstyle. There are 6 types of upgrades if i'm not mistaken and each legendary can only switch to one of the same type. There's probably going to be types that are more used than others, but i'm afraid you would not be able to switch to a healing build from a dps build because the upgrades will be definitely from a different type.
---
Since there's no visual effect attached i'm probably going to wait until the price stabilices after the initial rush to see how much do these things cost.
---
I Figured It'd be a raid thing , yeah. Fire still has a higher DPS output though, doesn't it?
---
&gt; So what's the difference, they get criticized anyway.
---
But a business 101 course told them that communication solves everything...
---
Say whether you are on NA or EU. On EU I have a very social guild I could invite you to that does a ton of events aimed at getting people to know each other.
---
Air does  respectable damage when Specced out right, It just feels weaker when I compare it to the Combined Power / Condition damage from Fire when using the same specs
---
Not unused, Just Neglected as an element.
---
Every element has a Use, yeah. I just feel like Fire and Water get all the focus.
---
Things for wvw players arent that bad, we just need servers that can handle fights and solution to the dead servers/links. Those that actually play mainly wvw don't really want fancy updates like events etc introduced. '
---
Few things that have never actually worked well.
---
"Play how YOU want" unless it ain't meta
---
or 
---
"We ain't that other game" unless we get stuck for what to do next.
---
its way more expensive than legendary armor though.  
---
the only benefit is probably less used inventory space, since you use more runes than armorsets, but thats a very minor advantage.
---
Fellow D2 refugee? It's also been through some seriously rocky periods, but the turnaround post-Forsaken has been amazing.
---
As a graphic designer, don't you ever consider how the end user is going to have to use this UI? Think about raids. Do you really think that people are going to be fine with that one guy who has legendary armor saying "wait guys don't pull the boss yet, I'm still manually scrolling through this massive list of runes trying to find the one I need for the 6th time."
---
Yup! Destiny 2 it is!
---
Sometime I really want to play as a Frost Mage, but it's just not possible right now. Why not Anet design the next specs for ele to be like you discard one(or maybe 2?) element to enhance the other.  I would love to try a water-earth only ele.
---
"A bit excessive"? It's about as excessive as using a rocket launcher to kill a mosquito.
---
We Germans like our jokes if you have the correct forms filled out before telling them!
---
Maybe I played it a few weeks after release, but I don't remember it being that difficult? :P
---
hasnt gotten one either what gives anet must hate me
---
Playing wvw quadrupled the size of my friends list, and I’m now running out of guild slots just for friend stuff. 
---
Helping people with dungeons and fractals netted me new friends.
---
Just being friendly to someone in map chat can sometimes end up in friending people.
---
The important thing, though, is that you do need to talk. There are plenty of people in wvw who never make friends in it because they don’t talk to people or help others. I’m not a very social person IRL, mind you, but I don’t think you need charisma 20 to be able to make friends in this game. There are just a few things you need to do: talk, and don’t be afraid to chime in when other people are talking. Joke. Humor goes a very long way. Volunteer. Help people when they ask for it, and be social and chatty along the way. Thank. Showing appreciation for others and asking how they do things is a great way to start a conversation.
---
And if you like someone you’ve talked to a bit, ask if you can friend them and say hi when you see them around. Don’t try to talk to them when they seem busy, and don’t talk about yourself all the time. Ask what they’re doing and if they seem to be looking for something to do, come up with ideas to go adventuring with them or just have a spar in the guild hall. Don’t take it personally when they say no. Don’t get bothered if one of them drops out of contact. Appreciate their presence as they come.
---
Friendships require building. Don’t be afraid to build them. I’m sure there are people who would love talking to you, but they need to know you exist first. Reach out! Like many other things, what you get is what you put in.
---
It isn't. Thats the point.
---
Air is used a lot in fresh air tempest. It's probably the single best ele build for open world roaming right now. 
---
Also condi weaver is rather OP since the latest balance patch. It uses earth a lot in order to stack massive amounts of bleed on a target. 
---
I usually play fresh air scepter/focus weaver in pvp/wvw, which switches between every single attunement to do massive bursts every 3 seconds. 
---
I personally think ele's in a really good place right now in terms of build diversity. Still waiting for some core ele buffs though.
---
&gt;Not to mention claiming that clip looks like a DPS fight in other games? Seriously? That fight lasted for literal hours. Claiming the TTK in GW2 is so fast that its equivalent to "twitchy games" AKA shooters like Unreal Tournament and Quake is absolutely daft especially when using that fight as an example. Guild Wars 2 doesn't even have the fastest TTK among MMORPGs so all I can imagine is that you haven't actually played many others and just want to defend GW2 with what you feel is an accurate assessment. That clip isn't remotely close to the level of burst seen in other games, I don't know where you got the idea that all MMORPGs but GW2 function at a snail's pace but its patently false. There are many Asian MMORPGs where the PvP is designed around stuns, just like MOBAs, where the entire meta is to kill someone before the stun wears off so they practice rotations to fit as much dps as they can into that tiny couple second window.
---
This is literally 2 bunkers fighting each other, i had DPS vs DPS last this long back when i played WoW.
---
Also, i am not talking about ridiculous damage only, because Gw2 has a plethora of ways to avoid spikes, getting oneshot by someone with 10x your gear in BDO is not what i mean.
---
&gt;Besides if you're going to compare one aspect, you should also compare other aspects. Sure a 1v1 in GW2 PvP can be very dynamic and creative but GW2 also has... world bosses which are just non-interactive spam and a buggy, laggy mess as well as halfassed dungeons and fractals where you can skip over whole areas or break a fight by stacking in a particular spot. You say FF14 only involves standing still waiting for one ability to come off cooldown, yet don't mention Raids where if you stand still for even a second you wipe, while also watching mechanics that require specific responses, and also making sure you maintain your rotation which involves animation canceling multiple abilities withing the 2.5s GCD and if you mess up by even half a second your entire rotation shifts and misses precise DPS windows. I'm sure you didn't know that part of the game exists though.
---
I don't PvE ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
PvP gameplay will always be more interactice and dynamic than PvE gameplay, also being more fast-paced most of the time.
---
&gt;But as I said, I'm not defending one over the other because even if we say that this is "top tier MMORPG gameplay" doesn't mean much compared to game with actual gameplay so its pointless. I'm just pointing out inconsistencies and saying that just because something is faster during one particular aspect it doesn't mean it's "better" or even overall faster when considering the whole picture.
---
To me it's like comparing topdown to third person gameplay.
---
Gw2 has the best tab target system really, otherwise i only play action combat. Gw2 has all the things from action combat except the aiming really.
---
Dodges, combo fields, many targeted skills, can attack without needing a target, no rng evades/blocks etc.
---
Pure tab target is outdated, it is a system made upon networking limitations from back then, there is a reason zero other genres use the combat system.
---
I say the same about MOBA's really, the only MOBA i play is Smite, as an RTS player topdown combat single unit controlling feels like a mod to me.
---
No. Fresh air means spamming air attunement. Play dps tempest and you'll be spamming thunderstorms all the time.
---
And if you want to really use every element. Play condi weaver.
---
&gt; The time I spent in the original Guild Wars, and therefore my attachment to the universe, is pretty much what keeps me going.
---
Funny (or sad?) thing is, most of the people at the top of the community (youtubers, streamers, other content creators) are those who came from GW1. Teapot, WoodenPotatoes, plenty of SC guys, even Helseth when he was active.
---
It made me realize that GW2 utterly failed at creating a community that cares about the game deeply enough. Most of the people who are the "pillars of the community" are here because of their attachments to GW1 and the franchise.
---
If GW2 was Anet's first product, there wouldn't be any community at all, just people spamming 111 in silence.
---
For casuals probably..
---
Hot take incoming: Anet is too PC to get jokes anymore. They assume that everything they don't understand is dangerous, and possibly racist or malicious. They are living in their safe space and ban anything that's outside of it. This is why they also can't take any criticism because they view it as toxic.
---
when I tip its usually 1g
---
Yeah because "ppl who don't get even this simple math" should all have the same opinion like you? There is more to it then simple math. I for example will get a set of them probably 1 or 2 months after they come out. Not because I think they are worth it from a gold standpoint, but because I would like to have the convenience they give and value it more then I mind the cost.
---
I think at this point anyone who wants any sort of challenge, replayability, or true group content at all is viewed as a hardcore player by the GW2 community.
---
Wat.
---
Hardly a hot take. Moderation of the actual "official" channels (forums, gw2 twitch, ...) is absurd. Then again creating safespace for retired gamers is kind of the niche they're aiming for.
---
1) The post’s about FE, not the fractal 
---
2) You aren’t helping newbies if you carry them through everything solo. They still won’t know what to do next time
---
That would be an incredibly stupid waste of time and money.
---
I'm a pretty broke player usually so I do 1 to 5 gold depending on length, difficulty and a little more if they seem nice.
---
Using wrong type of stats is a different story. I'm just saying that any weapon is alright
---
Not sure if they expect it even but I'm pretty sure they are at least hoping for a little tip.
---
Same with music players or hp run commanders.
---
Player driven content like gvg, a scene that was once fairly big and active? 
---
No you're supposed to interrupt their gameplay as dev, tell players to fuck off and stop ruining the gamemode but refuse to give them a reasonable alternative. 
---
Then design stuff that could perfectly fit what is required but ensure the design neglects the wishes of that player driven content entirely. Like OS, guildhall and the first iterations of the eotm arena. 
---
Gw2 would be more successful if they allow player ran mods and maps, at least then we can have userpatches for wvw and pvp cause anet wont do them.
---
im fine with the game being this way, its the mmo i go back to every few months without fail, i get my high quality content chunk and then go on with my life, its a fun game to play when you cant dedicate your life to an mmo anymore, its the mmo players can go to retire in my eyes, just get some solid high quality mmo fun in every few months without re subbing or grinding your ass off to play new content, just jump in, have fun and move on if you want and im happy with that, could they do more, sure but the way the community has just lost its mind lately is really sad, if game has you this upset, take step back, play another and return when you feel like games got more content
---
well actually ... the first plan for the elite spec of POF was to select only 2 elements and adding a weapon swap to ele !
---
But they dropped the idea and went for the current weaver spec ! fun fact you know.
---
*"At least the fire elemental was stopped before it could do too much damage."*
---
*Sees that guy with Crystal, Ember and 8 Phospholuminescent infusions*
---
Oh
---
 "Your—grawl—impression—is—really—coming—along."
---
You can but you can't spam more than 3 times before your chat muted that way, if you ping an item from your inventory with ctrl click you can spam it a lot more. Sorta works against faking
---
I agree but its painfully obvious that this balance approach is retarded. No other way to say it.
---
By inducing a lot more of these high impact skills and boons, spammy or otherwise they have made the game more fast paced, more powercreep and more raw options thus harder to balance. 
---
Especially for pvp, but also for pve it further moves the game towards full damage avoidance/ mitigation and one shot mechanics / burst because you can, with good gameplay, avoid far too much damage through well timed actives.
---
At the same time, due to a lack of rigorous balancing because they're incompetent, the difference between doing random stuff and optimised gameplay increased. In the past stuff like 25 might acted as equalizer making the difference smaller.
---
Take new stuff like damage multipliers and alacrity and they do the exact opposite. They increase the difference between good and bad players vastly.
---
They took a populistic balancing idea that caters to the masses, but the result is the opposite. Good players abused this added "power" far better than bad ones who were left behind.
---
raven mantle from the gemstore
---
Oh course! Lol so pretty
---
2k hours is casual?
---
not just to limit inflation but to avoid that people use the TP as an extension of the personal bank. That's why 5% is charged beforehand.
---
cause pvp in mmos is dead
---
I really hope you're kidding. :O
---
Is it really poaching? I imagine grouch singlehandedly carrying the pvp scene feels as bad as a dev as it does for the pvp players.
---
is this an open book survey or do we have to have the answers memorized?
---
If the Tp didn't have those fees, specially the listing fee, it would become an useless tool.
---
There is no content drought at all, at least not this summer. Those people certainly do live one or two or more years ago and just switched the memories, because if anything, then many people are actually exhausted by doing all the stuff this summer. There is nearly zero resting time in between new LS release, filler events, raid event, festival, another festival, and it won't get better next month as well, as they will introduce something new for sure again.
---
But then you have to run healbrand and diviner alacrigade, i suppose?
---
cQB &amp; healacrigade nets much more dmg...
---
I don't see it. Cantha was not pink and if I think about Asian culture pink is the last thing i'd think about.
---
PINK mesmer (and now thief too) here, when i port JPs i dont expect tips, as most JPs can be skipped, tips did range from 5s up to 20g, but on average its 1-2g, IF someone wants to tip, but nobody providing portals should "ask" for it, since that is no longer a tip.
---
In the end its more about the gesture, even a nice mail powers us porting for hours (i remember porting for 7h).  For us the joy of a happy person counts more, i remeber being proud doing "Not so secret" for people who were close to quit getting thier goals. 
---
btw, if you ever encounter me on a JP, prepare for cookies
---
You dont know how satisfied i feel every time a new atteibute combination comes into the game and im like "yeah fuckers i already have it on my leg, feeeling greaaat"
---
You can do it with springer and BoF too if you're in right spot. (For those without skyscale)
---
This isn't a content drought. Its a communication drought sure and I'm glad this week we had some news but if you want a content drought go back to 2015 or after HoTs release. Living world didn't start till July 2016 after HoT released. We are getting content in my opinion next week we are getting the wrong content but since episode 6 two months ago we have gotten content every couple of weeks.
---
I don't know, do you have 90 minutes?
---
The momentum died because PoF literally had no endgame.
---
I loved the story (HUGE improvement over HoT), exploring the maps and unlocking all five mounts but there was nothing repeatable.
---
Static Raids give you a little group of people that get close pretty quickly.
---
Playing the MMO part of the game weirdly makes you find friends quickly.
---
sakura aka cherry blossoms?
---
That all makes sense and in the early days of gw2 I was pretty looked up to as far as stats and experience went but that was back when dungeons were actually worthwhile and people actually wanted to run them. There have been so many changes since I came back that I’m struggling to keep up, I haven’t the first clue on a lot of events and yet at the same time I’ve run most of them haha.
---
I used to mentor fractals and I don’t have an issue being social or making friends in an actual real life setting but in GW2 it feels a little more contrived.
---
This is me reaching out! Lmao! I really hadn’t the first clue of where to begin and have been lurking this forum for a while. I kinda expected a lot more negativity than I received so your comment was really nice to read!
---
I’m guessing though not much will come of this and maybe I should just give up on GW2 altogether honestly, it’s fun to play now and again but the camaraderie is dead.
---
I thought Legion was received pretty good by the community tho? I didnt have any problem with it so far.
---
The price of the full package will be adjusted to not count the episodes you already have. So yes, purchasing the full pack for 160 gems instead of 200g for a single episode is due to the full package having excluded the episodes you already own. If you had missed 2 episodes instead of 1 the price would have been 320 gems.
---
I don't mind if Norn get ice features one day when it becomes part of their story in a way that can explain benevolent branding. 
---
Fashion is a deity. You can't ignore her.
---
Honestly, it is not even communication drought. They gave the main ideas what will be next in march roadmap (that's just a quarted year back), and as we know now, they already deliver from that plan (runes/sigils). Anniversary is next month and is pretty easy to guess that it will be time for another roadmap update/big blogs/videos/ or even just big update patch in general. If we won't hear release date for LS5 on anniversary, then I don't know when else we would. 
---
You cannot expect them to blow all their cards just before big event.
---
What are you confused about? 
---
Me and friends played in beginning, they lost interest i continued to play. 
---
Made new friends in game, they also stop playing eventually. 
---
Then I stop playing for a few months but log in once in a while for mindless grinding.
---
No friends play anymore.
---
Easier to understand? I used less words, also I’m on the NA server, I forgot there were even serves omg.
---
so, they've been hiding k-pop then?
---
Problem is when it's less comfy then arctemplates then it would be kinda shit... And I perfectly see anet implementing a less powerful system :/
---
Do you mean the addition of the new instabilities? If so, I have to say that the outcry was partly reasonable. Some fractals didn't become really challenging but plain annoying to run if you had a combination of certain instabilities. I love challenging content but some fractals became just tedious. I am glad they removed most of those instability/fractal combinations by now
---
The problem is: Your president is not trump!
---
There's a reason why the term "UI/UX designer" has become more popular in the last few years. UX being user experience.
---
A UI/UX designer is conscious and puts emphasis on how the design is perceived by the end user. Traditionally you could say that any good designer bears this in mind, but nowadays there's the separation where graphic designers are considered people who just make things look nice without caring if people can even understand or use the final product.
---
50s to 1g for dailies. For achievement-related stuff and really long-winded JPs i can't do myself (like ember bay) usually like 10g.
---
if its a jp i could normally do on my daredevil with staff# but couldnt be arsed logging into it, i tip the porter 1g when its a daily
---
if its a terrible jp and never a daily and i have never managed to complete on my own (and has no mount skps), then up to 50g (season 3 jps)
---
but i often dont tip during peak time when i'm one in a herd taking portals
---
There's a big difference between making a great game and making a successful game.
---
Appealing to the masses appears to make the most business sense rather than finding your niche and capitalising on it.
---
I'm not sure it makes that much sense any more. If everyone is doing it then there's way too many generic games vying for everyone's attention.
---
thank god there's autoloot on the game, if not you will see docens of chests aftar each would event.
---
I have a feeling a lot of people are looking at this solely from a player point of view and not considering Anet point of view.   We as players can go casuals vs hardcore... anet dont have that luxury.  They need to cater to all. We do tons of assumptions, Anet have the data to make decision based on facts. We act based on emotion, I most definietly hope that arenanet dont. 
---
Let me explain, Nike in his video says that wing 6 and 7 were easy and thats an indication that game went full on casual. He also says that only 1000 people completed  wing 5 CM and the majority of those bought the run. Now lets assume thats true how many still try to beat it? cause here is the thing if a good amount of people were giving up on wing 5 and quit raiding because of it, is it that surprising anet would choose to dial down the difficult for the next couple of wings in the hopes or reigniting participation?  I'd say its a move that makes sense and again from anet point of view, there isnt we have to keep the difficulty momentum going to make hardcore players happy or we have to go full casual to make all casuals happy. For them its "there is this game mode and while we're committed to it we have to make sure we make everyone happy even if it means no one will actually be happy ". while that may sound self defeating  its not because yes it will result in loosing some hardcore players and some casual players but it may still be better then the alternative IE loosing all hardcore or all casuals if they take a more definitive stance. To add to that I am not sure hardcore players want that fight either because if they decided to focus further on casuals chances are it was because the biggest number of players lies in that segment. But back on subject. I dont agree that wing 6,7 being easier is an indication  that anet went full on casual because at the same time if we look at fractals Siren's reef, the last fractal to release is arguably the most difficult (or at least I am sure everyone will agree its one of the most difficult). 
---
I think its a mistake to except Anet to take a stance in the whole casual vs hardcore, they just cant afford to !
---
Now communication on the other hand is a tricky beast... lets say raids is played by 10% of the players for the sake of argument and lets say they communicated to us that yeah they see we're not happy with the cadence and will be boosting the raid team to get back to the 3-4 month range and then all of a sudden happens whats been happening for the last couple of days and all hell breaks loose about content droughts. They've been trying to do little events every two weeks in between releases to keep us happy but clearly that has backfired with the events being meaty. Now if they didnt commit those people to raids they can redirect them to the live team they've setup post layoffs and produce meatier interim content defusing that fire but if they have commit them to raids they cant which will anger 100% of the players (of course raid players dont just play the game for raids, they do open world too i imagine) or redirect them anyway making that 10% furious not to mention how much bad publicity they would have to endure with the whole they lied thing that will surely come out. Communication is great, communication is important but with all due respect I cant think of a single time when anet did try to communicate and us grabbing that communication and smashing it right back on their heads. From the manifesto to jessica price (try to ignore the controversy around it and focus on the fact the issue happened  because a dev on her off hours was communicating with fans)  I know this isnt a popular opinion and it isnt what people want to hear but its a fact that you're not going to get communication if the community doesnt provide a safe space for that communication and I am not saying we have to agree and be yes sir bots but there is a difference between saying you dont think gw2's design lives up to the manifesto to repeatedly stating at every opportunity how clearly Anet lied in their manifesto and cant be trusted about anything for example.
---
Damn, missed the simplest step. PvE is my favorite game type but I know people are more interested in WvW and PvP so maybe that’s a better place to start.
---
You never said any of this in your post. Not that it matters really because you seem to look for something in the wrong place.
---
If you mentoring some players through something, "porting jumping puzzles", leading assaults on Tarir or helping someone with achievement points are a very different situation than just playing stuff together.
---
In most of those situations you are fulfilling a task, you offer your services and after that is completed you both go your ways. The whole thing you go into this situation is very different.
---
I don't want to chat or befriend someone who provides a port in a jumping puzzle, why should I? I wouldn't want to befriend someone who hands out coupons on the street either.
---
A guild is the perfect place for people to find a common ground they can play together with because, you know, that is the whole point of a guild, to find like minded players and stay in touch more easily than a Friendlist.
---
You said yourself that you are "gotten trampled by their sheer size or players who are already cliquey with no room for me to chime in" which tells me that you are hesitant to actually break of a conversation even though you are part of a guild. I would rather ask myself why that is?!
---
You can't force those things, people don't join a squad or a port to the jumping puzzle to make friends but rather to get shit done. Participating in activities with the same people, meeting up with them and generally talking with them does that.
---
&gt; There are plenty of people who played this game for 3.5 years before raids even existed and arguably that was the most popular this game has ever been
---
A big reason for this is that speedruning dungeons was mostly harder than doing raids.
---
We had a much bigger hardcore community around that time.
---
The only reason dungeons or fractals seem easier to casual ppl is cause of the missing  enrage timer which allows that content to be cheesed and being able to be completed by everyone.
---
I think you’re completely off tangent but again thanks anyways!
---
Honestly I'm pretty sure that most of the anet employees don't play this game. I personally haven't let that there is any passion for this game in their studio.
---
Stand in lions arch and talk in map chat and hope that you make a friend.
---
Or join a guild and make friends there when you do stuff together.
---
If you cannot open your eyes to the fact that its so much easier to make friends through guilds, all i can say is good luck.
---
Game can't keep the gpu fed in wvw zerg fests. May as well increase the clarity of the slideshow.
---
It's simple, it helps to filter out a portion of newbies when you want to have a run with experienced people.
---
When I make a group I'm normally not looking for it to be a training run. In general, if someone is linking back KP than they either have experience, or if they went to all the trouble to fake a chat code, they have probably at the very least also went to the trouble to look up how a particular boss work. I'm also not really stingy with numbers, if there is a number next to the KP it is arbitrarily chosen and someone links a number of KP that is just a bit below I will still accept them(and on my w7 runs my LFGs atm are still just a flat "KP" ). Again, it's just to filter out the worst out there so the chances of having a smooth run will be that much higher.
---
I'm just saying it's hardly poaching if your current company refuses to put resources into the things you want to work on.
---
Who contacts who first? I dont really care. If you aren't able to do what you stand behind or enjoy doing its not surprising you eventually move on. 
---
Did Amazon poach or did gw2 drive devs away? Did gw2 poach bless players or did bless drive their players away? Did ff poach gw2 raiders or did gw2 drive them away? 
---
All of these were committed to their first choice originally. It's on them to retain people. Poaching is offering people absurd amounts of money... I think anet simply isnt nice to work for for talented devs. That's on anet, not on Amazon poaching.
---
How do you get involved in static raids? What is a static raid?! See this is the piece of the puzzle that I’m missing tbh because before I relied on dungeons and fractals and with all the new content I feel like there are better platforms to interact with people!
---
I think they have made a mistake. They could have released season 5 news already. Not a release date or spoilers but what season 5 will be and how it will be different. If Z comes out with a blog today detailing how season 5 is different from previous living world seasons I think a lot of the complaints will die down. Obviously there will be those who will  bitch about everything good or bad and to be quite honest thats such a small minority of this community I just ignore them but the criticisms people have had about communication this week I agree with and I am an Anet loyalist I'll defend basically everything they do.
---
The price of the gems on the gemstore will probably never change (you can try to find deals on retailers that sell gem cards but always play it safe and use approved retailers).
---
But you can expect discounts for the things you can purchase with gems.
---
Heh superscript is hard to see on a 4.5" phone screen!  I zoomed in and see it now. ;)
---
Great video.
---
While it is important to understand that some of the stuff that happened in Anet were not in their hands (like Amazon luring away some important people in the studio), we also have to accept that in the last 2 years some of the decisions taken by Anet on how and what to develop for the game have been blatanly stupid to say the least.
---
First of all, the biggest mistake was clearly the Living Story episodes. Nobody plays an MMORPG only to receive some episodic story content every 3-4 months. Not even the hard casuals. No matter how good this content is. Thus while it may seem like the focus on LS episodes was a step in the right direction to satisfy casuals, it was not. This type of design didn't help anyone (hardcore/casual).
---
Now during HoT at least you could say that LS maps had some purpose (Leather farming, Berry farming etc.), the episodes came out faster and there was more stuff going on overall in the game. But PoF LS releases? Oh boy, they fucked up big time here. I admit that some of decisions taken during this time might have something to do with Anet focusing on 2 other projects at that time and some people not being able to work full-time for GW2, but some of the stuff that happened here was just insane. For some reason they have decided to focus entirely on LS story content instead of actually designing LS maps that could at least have a bit of replayability in the long term. They have ignored almost every other game mode and focused on increasing the quality of the story episodes they make. 
---
I want to give you an example of how insane some of the decisions taken here were:   
---
We know for a fact that the full scale Kralkatorrik model they used in the last episode was the product of months of work done by certain people in the company. More than 6 months of work to say the least. We know that they wanted to use the full scale model already in Episode 5 and they couldn't since it wasn't finished. So they only used Kralk's head instead. So what happened in the end with the full scale Kralk model that took more than 6 months to develop by certain people at Anet? It was used for a 5-10 min part in the latest story. That's it! More than 6 months of work by certain people and it was only to give each one of us an experience with it for 5 mins.
---
There are a lot of other examples of how insanely bad some of the decisions they took were, but I wanna stop here. And no, I refuse the believe that a lot these bad decisions could all be explained by the layoffs and people working for other projects in Anet. Bad decisions were taken, plain and simple. And you know what is worse? The latest MikeZ roadmap clearly shows that they don't want to change this type of development in any way. Not one bit. 
---
More people focusing on GW2? It won't matter at all. Because the ones that made all the bad calls already made the same calls for LS5.
---
That's not a raid that is just a general world boss you only press 1 for.
---
Understandable :)
---
Its not just giveaways. EU has a difference in culture showing clearly in lfg, raids, wvw, pvp and how the game is played. It also has stricter localisation in play time.
---
There are plenty of occasions where anet felt desperately out of touch with how the game is played on EU.
---
Hahahah i do this so often it’s silly, especially when Im crafting in the mystic forge, haven’t made friends but maybe it’s a random occurrence.
---
I might try guilds again but meh, didn’t know that was the *only* way.
---
They are being treated fairly reasonably given their track record.
---
People complained about the Joko fight being too hard because you NEED to CC his breakbar during the fight. And Joko's fight was more fun and easier than Caudecus.
---
If someone mentions tips. Dont tip them. Tip those who are helping, rather than afking for money. JPs are easily cheesed with mounts. So it's not like it took effort.
---
 1g for a 60 second cooldown seems fair. 1 port tip per cooldown = 60g/hr. 
---
That's my standpoint anyway. You may disagree.
---
Ivan, you always rush B. RUSH B BLYAT!!!
---
&gt; I just feel like Fire and Water get all the focus. 
---
Fire maybe, because DPS, but water? Who uses water?
---
I'm not saying it's a bad thing , just thought it was funny how a lot of threads are expanding into these huge discussions whenever these words are uttered xD 
---
again not a bad thing
---
100% more people were doing the basics and if you were an expert on the basics you could make friends more easily!
---
To say it was "rough" was an understatement, honestly - post-Forsaken was the perfect time to jump in and I'm a little jealous you got to experience it all fresh. I still have nightmares of pre-"Go Fast" update
---
Not the only way but the smoothest way.
---
The proportion of people who bother using a couple lines of code is neglectable. There is no almost no way someone who owns fractal god and spams a stack of 250kp followed by a stack of 249kp is lying to you. It's very easy by looking at one's character who's lying and who isn't. The amount of KP, the way the player decided to ping KP, fractal attunements, achievement points (between 15kp-27kp, not above), character appearance, above 200 AR... All of those assets combined are representative of a certain mindset that I, as a very invested fractal player, share.
---
For core tyria 10-50 silvers
---
so if you needed 20 stacks of mithril, you'd go around and ask everyone to sell you a stack or two, until you got all of them? sure...
---
They often don't know, and almost always refuse to put into practice what they do know. Look at how Anet has to nerf some events that require a bit of knowledge/effort, or how some metas fail if you don't have a few players pulling their weight with proper dps/cc. Or how as soon as anything that requires some effort above the level they are used to is released there is complaints everywhere. I'm talking about the kind of player who after years of playing still struggle to handle a pack of Pocket Raptors.
---
Hell, I used to love helping pugs in fractals with my Minstrel Firebrand/Chrono, and even in T4 most of the time there was at least one person who got through all other tiers and still didn't know basic mechanics that are learned in T1. At that point you have to be avoiding paying attention on purpose or just be retarded.
---
Do they really check these ? Let me :doubt:
---
There are a lot of off meta builds which are all very capable of clearing all the content in this game. The issue is that the vast majority of the player base has no idea how to build a character and just throw any old thing on, because all open world content can be cleared by wearing any green item and spamming 1.
---
Lol
---
I've done a fuck load of raiding and only ever seen one commander ask for split stacks.
---
But I've definitely noticed high KP players to be a hell of a lot worse than they should be.
---
I mean people hardly ever die so so have no idea about down state interactions xD In my literally hundreds of pulls in the last 18 months I’ve seen ZERO bugs, and ZERO clips or videos of bugs so what can I say? If they exist they are so uncommon it’s almost irrelevant.
---
Also 350MC isn’t dirt cheap as far as EU servers go, and many members of my guild are participating in the ERP so yes, it’s a very good guild. 
---
Think about this, 350MC between 8 players, or 700MC between 8 if we have double buyer. It’s more than 65g each for 15 mins of work OR LESS. Lol.. 350MC is a VERY NORMAL price for Dhuum CM basically standard among CLL/EU and Rise. (I.e the major portion of selling that goes on on EU) I believe QQ and other guilds might do it slightly cheaper, I saw them posting 340MC a few days ago.
---
it's 24h of playtime
---
Well, scrolling through your responses, you're going through people's suggestions saying stuff like, 'Nope, doesn't work, not relevant, doesn't apply, it's not like that,' etc. and it either sounds like you're not really trying very hard to seek out what you're looking for, or you genuinely don't know how to make friends.
---
And even now you're dismissing the possibility that any fault whatsoever may lie with you as 'rudeness'. Maybe you should take this guy's response more seriously than the others, because I get the impression he is onto something. It's not an insult. Treat it as a learning experience.
---
The best way to make friends, as people have already told you, is through groups and guilds. You need to do things with people regularly. It doesn't matter what. Figure out what content you like to do, or want to be able to do, and then search for groups that are doing that and join them. Friendships happen naturally afterwards, or they don't. You can't force it.
---
It's the same gauntlet as always. It's just retoggling old content. I have been grinding the hell out of the first one and I have stopped being excited about it.
---
It is only dead in gw2 because anet abandoned it. HoT for pvp and raids was more or less a bait and switch
---
It's easier to get old players to come back than it is to get newer players to try a 6 year old game which has relatively been forgotten by the gaming community at large.
---
nothing,bcs if you give them something,it undermines their good will =)
---
&gt; That means future updates can't really grant new runes/sigils as rewards in a satisfying way... The legendary upgrades will auto unlock them, and then it's cool but you don't have to even play to earn them...
---
Of course they do, with how ludicrously priced the legendary upgrades seem to be, only the vast minority will make a full set. All the other non-hardcore players can still aquire them "as rewards in a satisfying way".
---
You could say the same thing about legendary weapons and armor too if you wanted to. No need to farm anything PoF-related when it comes to insignias/inscriptions since you already have legendaries for that, right?
---
I'll try this out tonight. Thanks
---
It still works, most ppl who fake it dont have a script.
---
You just ask "pls spam it" and they'll leave.
---
Still a dumb thing tho.
---
Well, if I can have legendary sigils I will finally have a reason to craft legendary weapons with full functionality of build-swap on the go.
---
Alright, so when's the first Living World patch with the next Elite Spec?
---
2k over 6 years is pretty casual as that's only about 83 days.
---
Amulet?
---
On whom does Qadim the Peerless fixate when the pylon controllers and only the pylon controllers have the flux disruptor active?
---
Does this change if no player is within a short range of Qadim? If so, then how?
---
Sigils. You can't swap sigils atm.
---
Runes not worth it of course.
---
This might sound cheesy, but you might have to change your attitude. Several people have made suggestions here, all shot down by you. Any one of them might've been willing to add you to their friends if you seemed like a nice person they'd want to play with. Did anyone?
---
Thanks everyone for the info! I'll cycle through the suggestions and see what fits for me. Good community is good.
---
Y'all doing a great deed
---
Go back to Warframe forums, please
---
No. Had subscribed to latest newsletter and had been Anet customer with same e-mail from 2005.
---
&gt; changing the UI usually breaks the game.
---
Sorry, what?
---
Reminds me of the old transmutation interface.
---
Yeah that's what I say after the "Hi" :D
---
Thats why i still have fond memories of my gw 1 days. It had good pvp (from casual modes to competitive), had normal difficulty content, hard content, added a hard mode for the normal content. Because gw 2 is primarily open world with many players in it, this isnt possible opposed to the instanced content/maps of gw 1. I was quite sad in the days gw 2 would not be a corpg (was the term used in that time) but a mmo. Officialy retired from gw 2 since yesterday, tired of the endless hamsterwheel openworld events with a cluster of stacking loottrain players. For now a break from gaming, later only playing single player games i guess. It was a good ride since 2005/2006. Time for new adventures. Maybe getting older also contributes, not as pasionned as in the old days, but hey thats life ;-)
---
Looking at the state of raids and how the playerbase feels about them I would embrace anything that lures players into raids if I were you.
---
Imagine this - you're testing out some new runes on your favorite toon somewhere in the open world. You've just crafted a full set of legendary runes, and you're excited to see some of that QoL you just paid way too much for. You decide to go back to Scholar runes. 
---
You open your menu, go to the equipment tab, double-click on your first piece of legendary armor, and double-click on the rune to open this god awful UI. Since this is Anet and we know there will likely be no search function or favorite system for the runes, you scroll past 70 other runes that literally nobody has ever used on purpose before you get to S. You choose the Scholar rune and JUST as you're about to click okay a veteran jacaranda from 4000 units away puts you in combat.
---
If no one is in range with the flux active he should target the closest and fixate on them until they go out of range or someone with the active flux enters range. I'm actually not 100% sure what happens if no one is in range, I'd guess he just picks a target at random but would have to confirm.
---
My toughts exactly.  
---
Altough legendary items are mostly supposed to be vanity items, the runes especially should not hit a legendary price point since it really is convinience only. Hovering around 100g for one rune is more then enough IMO.
---
I don't get the downvotes. You liked HoT, it's totally fine. And what it did is make grouping meaningful. Oh yes, there are things that could have been made differently, in a better way, such as hero points. But otherwise, it was MMO. Doable solo in most of the parts, easy and engaging with a group. Man, I still remember my first impression after completing Dragon Stand meta! That was a gorgeous experience, 150 players working together... It was amazing. Getting points on that map were not though. But the best thing it did is encouraging people to step up and became a commander to help others. This is what I loved about GW2. Not anymore, because new metas are not even close, also my FPS is around 0 on each of them (while totally fine in DS). So yeah, I don't get why people downvoted you.
---
if you can only throw on a single direction and the path is blocked by an obstacle you would need to move so that the path becomes unblocked. It's the same behaviour of line of sight. Even if you can perceive your enemy by other means than sight the projectile you throw is not going to magically avoid an obstacle and reach it's target. You will have to move to a position where the path is not blocked. In the end this means that it doesn't mind if you are blind or not for your ranged attacks to land.
---
I just say ty
---
I'm still mourning for the PvP which was simplified and murdered over and over and over again from launch. Pre HoT ranked and leaderboards were the most fun I've ever had in a video game. 
---
It's pitiful that they couldn't handle more than 2-3 builds on each class to balance or even implement a report system...
---
Time investment is really only part of the term casual and a rather small part imo. You can spend 5+hrs in the game every day and do nothing but world bosses and random events and I'll call you casual. Another person can then spend 2hrs and do the raids/ T4 fractals/ corner the AH on particular goods and I'll call them hardcore. Because time investment means nothing of you don't look at what that person is doing with that time.
---
That said if you are only spending an hour a day in a game I will consider you mainly a causal because an hour is not a lot of time to invest in a game. Most things in MMOs/games as a service require a lot of time as they are designed to be time sinks. There are very few things you can do inside an hour in GW2.
---
1 rune statuette that can be combined with 5 others to make a rune scrap that can be combined with 9 others to make a rune ticket that can be exchanged for an RNG chance at a legendary rune.
---
Yes?
---
I don't know if you're trying and failing to be funny or just that ignorant.
---
Think I'll just stick with Scholars for another 6 years.
---
You just found a well known fallacy, the irrefutable argument. :-)
---
Honestly? I say 'ty' if I'm feeling generous.
---
People already don't like instabilities in Fractals now imagine in a much harder content like raids. I don't even want to think about those posts here on reddit.
---
&gt; A set of 7 runes (because having +1 makes saves me from having to manually move it back into the bag)
---
What about your aquabreather ? :)
---
Tbh very few ppls dont like em on fractals but the difference is they are activateable, so whoever do not like em on Can just deactivate em
---
&gt; And a lot of those people are gambling addicts lootbox games take advantage of. so just don't ok?
---
I wasn't discussing this part, mainly because it's totally right and there is not a lot of things to say that weren't said multiple times already.
---
But I've seen people spend litterally tens of thousands euros in a "F2P" game, and for those it wasn't as much as gambling than simply to be the very best in the server they were. They were litterally throwing money at their screens in order to win a gigantic epenis competition.
---
In those cases, it's not a gambling addiction. BUT I do agree on the gambling addiction problem, and I'm all for the removal of all randomness in what can be bought.
---
&gt; There's a vast disparity in what can be achieved when you compare players who understand game mechanics and lean into them and players who don't. 
---
Point in case: Chrono.
---
Triple-Blinking, usage of portals (easier portals on other classes), hell even understanding the core mechanic of the spec "continuum split" is too much to mentally handle for some people. They just don't get what happens. They can't wrap their head around it.
---
Wait, was Colin fired? Is that actually factual information? I always thought he was poached by Amazon Games Studios ahead of their development on 3 new games, and thus he simply left for a higher paying job.
---
People moaning about things taking to long to do and is to much of a grind and then when they fix it they will a few weeks later moan about content drought. This always makes me facepalm.
---
[If only there was a reliable way of searching, filtering and categorizing runes and sigils in the game](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:PvP_Build_window.jpg)
---
Ok well then how about some decent feedback from people?
---
You need to understand that people have different skill levels and that's ok. People have different time commitments and that's ok too.
---
Your bitching at the bottom was completely unessecary to validate your opinion/suggestion. 
---
It just gets people's backs up
---
I consider myself quite lucky where I enjoy casual open world stuff and super focused instanced stuff.
---
50s to 1g depending on the difficulty. Although I usually try to avoid tipping by just doing it myself.
---
Ah yes sorry no it didnt come off that way : ) I phrased that one sentence poorly lol
---
Yea, seems fair enough. I'll delete my previous comment so as not to add confusion.
---
To be fair world bosses are on timers so they could easily predict how many the players would be killing without needing to manipulate the result
---
The mechanic itself wouldnt take longer to develop than to develop instabilities but you'd need to create UI to get all of this working together so players would be able to mix and match. So yeah, I'm not asking for much more than u do.
---
Sorry, I haven't pugged sub 200kp in a while.
---
I think that power is better, additional 180 power every burn phase is really good, unless you have 2dh as your dps players. Theres alsp better cc and utility, sacrificing spirit sword you get access to wall or stability on a short cd. On top of that, phases should really be over before a burn qfb cqn ramp up to its fullest xd
---
Negative opinions about instabilities are posted not because they make content too hard, but because they are obnoxious, unfun and disrupt the flow of combat.
---
It'll be tla repeat of the achievements that already in game from previous mystic forge global events.
---
Nice post, 100% agree.
---
Btw
---
&gt; Legendary weapons [...]. You're mostly making them for the cosmetic aspects and taking the stat swapping + sigil/infusion swapping as a perk.
---
That's exactly how they were designed. At release they were just exotic-tier weapons with nice skin&amp;effects. Later they were upgrade to ascended-tier, but the whole cost was still specifically targeted at skin&amp;effects. "Legendary" didn't mean more than that. But you could only use a given skin once (skin = item and you could either use the item or transmute it) so some people crafted the same legendary(ies) several times to have them on different character / dual wield / different sets. One day Anet created Wardrobe, effectively making those duplicates useless. That's when they added the stat-swap toe legendaries. If was nothing but a compensation for the fact that crafting legendary a single time was now enough to use the skin as much as you want. Just an added perk, which at the time some people raged at because it was not enough to compensate for the 2nd identical legendary they made last month. (there was a 2nd compensation perk, the 25ap twice told legend achievement).
---
IMHO that was a mistake. Because from that point on, it was decided by anet and the community that stat-swap was a core legendary feature. People started making legendaries just for this feature (and expressing that they'd be mad if said feature was made available without having to pay legendary premium price, no matter if said price was originally designed solely for the skin). It culminated with pvp and wvw armors that came with full legendary price just for stat-swap ability (no skin), setting in stone the fact that stat-swap = legendary.
---
Why I say it was a mistake ? Because inability to stat-swap, relative unavailability of stats for experimentation and fun (you have to craft/buy/convert a set every time you want something else, and/or keep sets in inventory) is, in my opinion, the #1 obstacle for build diversity use in this game especially when compared to gw1 (where you could have a single gear set, maybe a few more weapons and helmets, and load literally dozens of builds on the fly that would just change skills&amp;attributes). Having a much better accessibility of full stat-swap non-legendary gear would have been, in my opinion, a great thing for the health of the game.
---

---
That's what I'm worried about, that the official build templates interface will turn out to be horribly kludgy but they'll still make Delta drop templates from arcdps because it's officially in game.
---
Pugs are instabilities.
---
I know it will make some people respond “angry” maby that what i want? :) 
---
and it has nothing to do with skills / no skills etc. We have so many different player segments here and what i feel is that people like me who actually like challenge and like wipe 100 of times to Down a boss, learn it, understand it etc. We lack harder content.   So why does people react with Down votes for stuff like this and respond with fractals is hard etc. That was what made me adding last lines at top, coz they Can just ignore the post, since it has nothing to do with Them anyway..
---
This exactly ^
---
The issue is that they had the layoffs, they had a season that was actaully the best story i ever played and they really made good effort. But the story ended with nothing. This was a good choice with chapter 5, it kind of needed it even and it was brilliant. 
---
But the road map that came out never mentioned what happens after season 5. There is not a single word about it anywere. So we do not know what season 5 means. We do not know if there even will be something after that. We know nothing and the first road map after the layoffs did not give that info. And they still just do the hum hum hum around it. That is not a good choice now. It was at chapter 5, but it is not working now.
---
Talking to us about the future after season 5 will calm this down.
---
You remind me of this one guy I ported. He was very persistent about the tip. Sent me 4 gold, I returned 3 saying I don't except tips over 1 gold. And he sent it back insisting I keep it.
---
The stuff im asking is done/developed, it just need to be put into raid content and be optional
---
usually 25s sometimes 50 if its a tough puzzle
---
As a general rule, I would say that you only need 2 capture points to win (excluding map gimmicks, like the ship points in the Capricorn map), so always think about the tradeoffs of going far. Also don't be too much focused on fully capping nodes, even decapping them has its weight on the scoreboard.
---
&gt; Same with music players
---
Ye that's weird to me tbh. Most of them just run a macro.
---
I remember there used to be a guy running a macro 24/7 in the mists and his name was something like "Tips for songs."
---
That was more annoying than anything else.
---
If you Think that its ok, but some players do not Think that :) and since its optional why should you Care?
---
Imagine how much dev time would have to go into that to ensure every pair-up was actually possible.
---
Actually there do exist exotic weapons that do scale with your level, but those are obtainable from single point in the game and cost quite a bunch of provisioner tokens, so no way to actually get those early. But in theory they would be lovely for when you level up alts. Still waaaay more costly than just buy new tier of weapon every 10 levels.
---
Are you sure you play pve? cause you've practically only listed builds you'd see in wvw and pvp. 
---
PvE: Fresh Air Tempest - literally the whole build is built around Fresh Air Trait in the air line.
---
PvE: Condi Weaver - Takes fire and Earth and uses all 4 elements during weave self
---
PvE: easy mode Heal tempest  - takes water arcane
---
PvE: might share heal tempest - takes fire and water 
---
PvP: Burn weaver - takes fire and water but water is for sustain and cleanse  in content that requires self sufficiency and where you actually see loads of enemy conditions
---
PvP: Support tempest - Mixing Fire, Water, Earth depending on your enemy compositions. Enemy is high condi pressure predicted? Fire, Water. Enemy is high power predicted? Water, Earth.
---
PvP: Core elementalist - Fire, Air, Water
---
WvW: Water, Arcane, Tempest - healer in a big way
---
I mean every mmo site I go onto I get spammed with big titty anime ladies in fantasy lands mmo's, etc.
---
Surely Anet can spend some money on advertising. I almost never see ads for GW2.
---
What are you talking about, they would have to rewrite most of it to fit 10 man instances (and make it usable outside fractals / not undependent fractals console in the first place). It's not like you can just copy and paste from mechanics from fractals to raids. I'm asking just for some numerical mods to the encounters (like VGs tp cicle radius +150%, player endurance set to 0) and you ask them to rewrite and adapt whole mechanics.
---
&gt; ach legendary trinket set should have also included a different way to obtain them.
---
Earlier they said that they want to bring a bunch of legendary trinkets. However, that doesn't mean that they bring them all together. That would be a big mistake tbh.
---
Tempest is outshined by Weaver I belive, You can make it work but "Easy rotations" and elementalist aren't going to mix well.
---
https://youtu.be/fHhFUqkiWl4
---
If that's too much I would look into another class.
---
The more responses I get from people who have and have not gotten one it seems totally random or nearly random.
---
That looks either like a very weird and rare TP glitch, or someone having access to your account and taking stuff from it. 
---
Would it be possible for you to ask if whether your account sent gold to another one? 
---
It may be a good idea to change your password and set SMS authentication if you can just in case.
---
I think you are missunderstanding the whole thing about this. I don't ask for them to tell me what season 5 will be about i ask them to tell me if there even is a future after season 5. We have ZERO clue if there is or not. 
---
And at this point season 5 is around the corner (or so i hope) So it is time to hype it up. Tell us things they can tell us about it. Over hype is not good, but what they are doing now is sinking them self. It worked at chapter 5, it is not working now. As you can clearly see because people are actaully leaving the game because they do not know anything. So let us know something instead of nothing. That is the point.
---
This isn't entirely true either. I know a few "loud" people who have now gotten one.
---
Very true I'm part of that 95%. That being said I find in an industry like game development having a passion for the game that you are making is one of the requirements to put out a good product.
---
Thanks for the reply :D and ya, now I think back, it won't be harrier because it won't do much heal for them like guardian :p 
---
So my another guess will be commander with marauders or just pure commander stats. Which also explained the low damage output when he fight under acs.
---
Thanks for your input and add discussion.
---
I think it's not even possible. Not without getting rid of all random mechanics.
---
Character respects have always been slow, expensive or even impossible in MMOs.
---
Mounts have always been static speed boosts in MMOs.
---
Moving while attacking has always been impossible in most MMOs.
---
Sending your materials directly to the bank without having to walk to a city has always been impossible in most MMOs.
---
Teleporting all over the world is either impossible, expensive or limited to city hubs in most MMOs.
---
You have to realize at some point that GW2 is not most MMOs.
---
I just imagined needing to loot map items from open world bosses to open raid instances. uhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
---
But idea about having option to chose predefined mutations/mods/instabilities (call them what you want), combine them and get more loot with increased challenge is correct, and would somehow increase content replayability, they just can't be random and forced on players like it happen in fractals.
---
Heal tempest?
---
doubt that 99.9% would keep them deactivated, and if they do they have no reason to flame about getting borred atleast.  im not talking about the current instas from fractals, im talking about stuff like 10-20% more dmg from specific mechas, mechas happens 50% more often or stuff like that.
---
Hi, I'm one of the leaders of PINK, we port people for fun. The end of a JP is usually a nice place to hang out. So while we don't ask for tips, we do enjoy receiving them (who wouldn't?). but a simple "thx" is more than enough ;)
---
PINK!
---
Ele rotations are more like attunement rotation and then use all skills  that do damage while in that attunement.
---
I refrain from dropping the crushing existential dread onto them.
---
Overhauling the balance of 7 wings is easier than making a new one... okay?
---
Also not something the vast majority would want. Why waste resources developing something that A) Will be turned off the vast majority of the time, B) Won't make players who actually use the mechanic happy (what reward do they get for adding difficulty to the fight?), C) Won't make players who want other, better content happy, and D) takes resources away from what could be put into the next wing?
---

Check boon condi tempest on sc site

And most Canthan people have black hair and black eyes.
---
It's simply true. Sampling is the key word here. Like in pretty much every other survey in existence.

https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest_-_Support_Healer
---
Healing tempest is very easy if you play staff and have other support like druid to provide boons like might. You can stay in the water all time, your auto attacks heal for ~1k, you have fast revive with traits and staff 3. You can go other attunements if you want and know there is no need for healing atm, like fire for dmg and might, earth for protection...
---
She looks like a Krytan noble.
---
I tip them with a /ty.
---
If you tack on support and tank builds, there's probably 20 different things you could play. It's mind-blowing that you wouldn't enjoy a single one of them. Maybe you just don't like the combat style of the game, then.
---
* Fire: Power/Condition
---
* Water: Heal/Support
---
* Air: Power/Crit
---
* Earth: Support/Condition
---
It's usually quite obvious for most people.
---
Thieves too? What do you mean?
---
Anet have already a lot unfinnished work to finish and they cant afford to waste time and resources on unnecessary stuff..
---
MajesticNoodle uploaded a [Condi Might Tempest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9X2iboiD94&amp;t=0s) video a few hours ago with (in my opinion) an easier rotation then fresh air tempest. But for raids this build is very situational cause normally a druid does all the might in the group. But for OpenWorld this build is very good.
---
But why not throw in all oft the face options they have? They already made and use them for NPC characters.
---
2 bosses at the same time?  
---
\[Heavy Scourge breathing\]
---
I assume youre not playing the game coz you like it, but coz you dont have anything better to do :) thats my answer.
---
Coz if you liked raiding its 5% about loot and 95% of just doing raids, understanding it, class, mechas etc.
---
Nah, the first one lasted less than a day.  The second one was about a week long.
---
But I do dislike carrying around two bagfulls of gear. I'd rather wait the extra 10 seconds for arc to sort my legendary shit out than sacrifice 20 to 40 inventory slots
---
that’s really sad actually
---
[Boon Temp ](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/tempest/boon/) 
---
Both rotations are kinda easy, 
---
You can go as staff tempest heal as well, then you have no rotation at all.
---
TFW you have to switch to water in fractals while herding pugs.
---
Never done a raid in Gw2, nor will i, nor where the quotes meant for raiding.. if those are the only dots ONE needs to connect in Gw2 everything else is fine i guess..
---
People did not ONLY run F40. Doing your T4s was still better. Plus after people finish T4s they have no incentive to run any other fractals in the first place. Plus you had to be a decent player to farm it efficiently in the first place. Plenty of F40 pugs I got with were so bad I told them they’d be better off running silverwastes. Honestly I get that it didn’t need to be in the game but, was it really that bad?
---
But if each and every legendary trinket has its own HugeAssAura, then your only option to use stat swapping gearsets is to walk around like the FX departments' bukkake surprise, which is also a bad.
---
I only take free port, and by that i mean the ones that "tips appreciated" are not mentioned. Lol. I wouldnt know how much is the right amount for any situation since we dont have tipping where im from. Makes me uncomfortable. When i offer port i made sure to say "its free!" too, haha
---
I agree and i loved the ending and everything about it. That is the sort of story i want and that keeps me here.
---
People moan about getting Aurene back, well we did not really get her back, she is an elder dragon now and not our personal pet and for that purpose of her comming back i am fine. I would not have been fine if she just came back and everything was the same as before. This was the perfect end.
---
&gt;  to prevent the need for the game to have microtransacations
---
The money prevent the NEED for mirotransaction. Too bad they're doing it because they WANT money D:
---
You dont interact with people during any other content. You just play beside them. Its like in cities. You live in an apartment with three other families 10 meters around you and dont know what they do at weekends. Thats basically what most of GW2s content degraded into.
---
Statics require you to talk to each other. Banter during breaks, before and after Raids usually get you into what other people do and if they have a hobby you share, or a game they play which you do play as well you will pick that up eventually. If you just share your love to gw2 than that's usually also dragging you into the Teamspeak more than the two days a week you are raiding to talk to the people you know and probably find more people in the guild that do something in the game you like while having a nice voice to talk to.
---
Its easy, but time intensive, to get involved in a static, which is, by the way, a group of in this case 10 people that meet each other to raid at specific days. You watch the lfg, or forum if you have experience in Raiding, or join a training community like Crossroads to get some exp first.
---
It’s just a profit thing. The game would 100% be made better if they went back and gave facelifts to stuff like dungeons and other outdated stuff (more guild tabs, better mail system, etc), but they see it as a waste of time. Better game doesn’t exactly translate to more money IN THE SHORT TERM. Which is Anet’s issue, they seem content with milking the cow dry then letting it die.
---
still pointless bro! most of runes are really cheap, you can test anything..... lol
---
Yeah, so why you deleted that last paragraph?
---
1 to 50g, depends on my mood and what jp
---
I mean if you’re good enough you can play whatever the fuck you want in 95% of Raids.
---
better buff shatterstone
---
We don't know. You can try gw1 in the meantime.
---
7 legendaries, full legendary gear strong with 1600 ish gold in the wallet, pure from playing and I got lime 3k hours in total over the entire game since release. More casual than you are is impossible
---
Are you intentionally missing the point. He said that in a reply to another comment.
---
Personally speaking, I try to avoid the portal temptation and just do the puzzle legit. Skipping content and going straight to the rewards doesn't make me feel good, I'd rather be frustrated than feel like I've cheated myself out of the chance to get better. To each their own though, if Anet really thought it was a problem they'd have prevented mesmer portals a long time ago.
---
They seem to think they know best. Like all their players are idiots. Blows my mind.
---
&gt; Why am I spending so much time and money for one trinket when a full armor set costs almost equivalent?
---
Because you need 150 weekly boss kills. Being able to do that is not money, but a time effort.
---
I don't see why they would when they an just keep making LWS and expansions for 'Guild Wars 2.' I mean, maybe eventually if they want to change engines or decide they have told the story they want to, but I have a feeling it will be several years IF it happens.
---
(EU) I generally don't tip, and when I port I don't expect tips either. A 'thank you' is enough.  
---
I tip 1-2g for difficult JPs (like that aetherblade JP.)
---
What they really should take from fractals is reward system for CMs. At this moment there is really no point in doing raid CM more than once as it gives no additional loot apart from the chest you get from achievement. What is more, people who don't manage to kill CM boss in like couple of weeks after wing release, have almost no chance finding a pug group doing it. Doing it later with static is also like bragging for help since rest of the team has no other real reason to do it.
---
What is it that you like most about GW2? I/We could give some recommendations on other games that do well in those areas as well.
---
He didn't voice his opinion, he stated facts.
---
&gt;  I still havnt done all the paths becuse I get kicked for not skipping the cutscenes.
---
Put up an LFG with "chill run | all cutscenes". Same with raids, you need to join "practice" / "training" runs.
---
Also KPs are boss decorations for that specific boss (or the boss at the end of the wing), not insights or magnetite shards.
---
I'm still frustrated with the fact that 2/3 "light armor" classes have the highest survivability, simply because they dodge and invuln so much.
---
Lol. Dude people don’t want to play another game. Your viewpoint is that of someone who doesn’t actually invest themselves into the game. The people complaining are the ones who want an MMO that is good. Anet should NOT be content with their game being for people who play once a month.
---
GW3 is unnecessary. We have a well developed game that just needs some juice.
---
Dickwolves O.o
---
I'm more of a casual player/completionist. I loved the questing and zone completion of this game, map and world was amazing!
---
Coz i like to raid as a raider and you dont, dont blame me kiddo
---
Gear swap is also instantly when you're in a city, vip area or raid lobby.
---
I was always scared it didn't age well, I guess I'll just have to try it first tho
---
I usually join with "hi bs/dps/heal" and just enter the wings. If they ask for pings I mention my title. Never been kicked so far.
---
Piggybacking off of this, you can also ask at r/MMO if you are looking for something new to try.
---
Just finished mine, took about 15 minutes.
---
They did such an amazing thing with 2 I'd love to see what they can do with a new engine and new world, just has me interested I guess
---
And an engine/framework overhaul. As great as GW2 is, and that I agree with you that it makes no sense to make GW3 because whatever content they’d make for it could just exist under the umbrella of GW2, this game will not age well if it doesn’t make some serious overhauls (to Vulkan or the like) in the next 2-5 years
---
The meta is not restrictive at all. People play dumb stuff all the time. Like pretty much some of the most off meta things were run in my statics. Condi Scrapper, Power Reaper, tempest in general. We’ve had full clears with people running garbage builds. The Raids are far too easy to ever make the complaint that meta is too restrictive on Anet’s side. You can say that LFG and PUGs don’t let you, but the easy solution to that is start your own group. Especially with the number of people who bring up this complaint like it’s valid.
---
The HoT meta events and silverwastes are my favorite gaming moments.  I wish other MMOs did something similar
---
From personnal experience (not in the game dev department, but the data one), you're contacted constantly (at least 1-2 times a week), even if you didn't put any hint that you were looking for opportunities
---
I do 2 or so gold for tips. If it's something like that JP in the volcano with the check points I'll do 5g since they're practically carrying me up it on their back. If it's one where it's someone just at the end saying tp to friend I typically don't tip them unless it was something I really struggled with.
---
Season 5 for what reason? so 95% of gw2 player can go youtube to check vids how to get the story / etc done fastest possible and afterwards cry about why the content is so fast to do?
---
Thank you, I'll definitely give that a try!
---
Oh shit i Just hit 29k

---
Bodybuilders against tipping squad checking in
---
Vulkan would probably be better overall vs DX12
---
It may look like grieving/marauders is better because it gives 4 stats instead of 3 but it gives less of each stat than full berserkers. Stay full berserker, it’s much better.
---
Since GW2 is game where you run around alone anways you will not notice the lack of players in outposts to group up with because there are always henchmans (npcs) to add to your team. With Nightfall and Eye of the North you can add cutomizable heros to your team to create insane team comps. Stacking necros and mesmers is the way to go, just like in raids.
---
The sad part is we used to have updates every two weeks, but instead of hiring more developers or trying to make it work they apologized and scraped the idea. I get it, that’s hard to do but, honestly who’s to say if we hadn’t kept that format if after 7 years we’d be a lot more popular and have made a lot more money.
---
Well, what can I say, people join groups with such lazy commanders and low standarts and then complain that pugging sucks and for some  reason even groups that should be good  judging by requirements turn out to be crap.  
---
Probably fun for a commander too. I can imagine that already, he asks for 100 dhuum, 50 q1 kp, you join, say "hi bs!" and enter the instance. Then he has to ask your personally to link your stuff (and remember, in a raid there can be up to 9 people like you), but instead you *mention* you title, 
---
Now this is an instakick if I saw one.
---
1G is what i always tip
---
There was something about that fight that just made it so hard on my daredevil. I raided to a pretty high level yet the boss just destroyed me over and over. I had other friends that i raided with talking about how easy it was and i was completely mind boggled.
---
There also would be a mountain of positivity that is actually warranted instead of how its blindly given, and we could trust that issues will be taken care of eventually. 
---
This imo is what Digital Extremes dwarfs Anet in alongside their roadmap+stream content, game. Their level of communication and owning up to fuck ups instead of hiding is something admirable to say the least, but they also dont lose their spark of creativity and what they want to add to their game. They constantly strive to be bigger better ect where Gw2 revels in the mediocre comfortable to make w.e meager gains it makes instead of  harnessing its actual potential it had all along.
---
So you're that ele i get soothing mist from
---
Honestly I find it so weird that people say it’s primarily open world. I feel like I rarely have a reason to actually go to open world maps for more than just farming. So it always feels to me like people saying it’s a farming game.
---
I pinged my invisible slippers you just can't see them because they're invisible!
---
They really need to separate WvW, PvE and PvP balance.
---
That one is a bit of a special case, being in the top 2 or 3 hardest (or at least most obnoxious) JPs in the game.  If someone goes out of their way to help you on that one, they probably earned a reward.
---
24 is generous. You aren’t playing 24 hours a day, chances are you capping at 6hour if you have a job so you basically get 4 days out of it and you can’t be bothered to go to your gh just ONCE in 4 days for all of 5 MINUTES to refresh a buff?
---
It’s like, how can we trust you to balance the game when you don’t understand it?
---
To be honest I kind of feel left behind because of not receiving this survey.
---
I’ve played since beta, spent quite a few hundreds of dollars in gemstore, I participate in everything there is: metas, ls, raids, fractals, dungeons, pvp and a bit of wvw; have all classes, all of them geared, never been banned blah blah blah. 
---
Doesn’t all this provide me with a tiny little chance to get asked about the game’s future when the survey drops?
---
So I’ve been loyal as fuck, active as fuck, and now I’m left behind as fuck :(
---
I think the only ones they haven't are for the most iconic characters like Balthazar, Caithe, Rytlock, etc.
---
Which makes sense to me that they cannot be copied perfectly. Game developers want to ensure that iconic characters remain unique to be identifiable.
---
They just don’t like the game as much as us. I feel like for most it literally is just a job. Would not be surprised if a lot of them payed other games.
---
Others have answered your basic question, so I will give a tip for gearing while levelling. 
---
If you go into WvW home world borderland (the one with the house icon) there is a vendor that sells always scaled to level blue/green gear for Karma. At higher levels you can get rare, but it's not cost efficient. 
---
It's a good way to save gold for 80 while keeping the toon properly geared (just get what you have not gotten in drops about every ten levels).
---
Right? Completely blows my mind that people are complaining about refreshing a free 24 hour buff.
---
??? That’s fucking dumb logic. Other more successful titles constantly ask for feedback and actually make promises they can’t keep, yet they still manage to be more successful.
---
Make a revenant and hop into the PVP area - you can set up your pvp build, buy white weapons to test with, and get a feel for the class without being max level. Run some unranked conquests and see if you like it or not.
---
We aren’t saying get rid of casual content. We’re saying make the game 95% casual that’s fine but, don’t kill the last 5% of hardcore content just because entitled people think every achievement in a free game should be handed to them.
---
Gear level does not change.
---
Depending on what that "loot crate" is, the gear within will always be the same level regardless of your character's level when opening. If you got it from the daily log in, then I do believe it will scale to your character upon obtaining - but lowest natural exotic drop is level 60 iirc.
---
That said, exotic gear is fairly easy to acquire at end-game, so there'd be no downside to getting some early.
---
No, it looks like a fucking weeb whining for weebland.
---
Cosmetically, you could at least transmute the armor set between however many heavy armor classes you have. Legendary trinkets are bound to one **character** at a time and, stat-swapping aside, if you only wanted the cosmetic part of it, that's not even transmutable.
---
So you're saying we should stop getting raids then?
---
Are you really that unable to see the destructive nature of your viewpoint?
---
If you are doing meta events **and** see yourself **dying** a lot, use mix of berserker and valk. Or marauder and valk.
---
With decimate defenses your crit cap is 50%.  After that, precision wont do much. That means you can change some pieces to valk (power vita ferocity)
---
However if you want to use soul eater, you go for zerg gear. The 5% heal from the trait should keep you alive nicely if you press more than 111.
---
However, for raids and fractals I suggest looking at guide and builds from either Snowcrows or Metabattle. The traits arent really that different across all modes (which is boring imo)
---
That is exactly my point, i seen so many ppls using the guides / vids with skycale etc. i used sooo many hours doing this content without any other guidings than the ones from ingame tooltips etc.  I like to play open world / storys but what i really love is raid  
---
And since i stopped playing WoW back in vanilla i have looked out for a game where i could find really good raid content without addons, now i finally found a game where the addons is excluded from. But still ppls uses so many guides, they flame when the content gets 2 hard etc. coz they dont feel like playing the raids and learn by doing they just wanna get the loot nothing else.. This has nothing to do with raiding in my opinion, this is atleast not what raiding started as or should be.
---
Playing raids to me is not about the loot, but about doing it, having fun while doing it and improve myself, teamplay, improve as a team and my class control.
---
&gt; If you give easy mode but leave out the rewards players will do it once and then never again.
---
So, like story instances?
---
Easy mode is not for you, why do you care so much? Worried your raid-selling business would get affected, hm?
---
This game needs more dumb fun, and it would give raids the life and attention they desperately need.
---
Actually I do, but I feel like I've always liked the class/weapon combinations that are not meta and/or strong enough.
---
I started this game off with Staff Necro back in beta, and I know staff on necro is superior garbage. GS Reaper is fine but Scourge just doesn't feel right.
---
I also like Staff Mesmer, even way before Mirage even existed. Chrono on the other hand is quite boring. DH Guardian is good but gets boring fast. Firebrand is meh, I never liked the tomes gameplay-wise. Warrior is fine, though a bit dull. Spellbreaker was a nice change of pace. Hammer Engi is nice but absolutely sub-par and holosmith feels boring to me.
---
Then there's thief which will forever be my favorite class. I like DD, DP, PP and Rifle (Short bow is utility, doesn't count). The latter I always wanted to have on thief. They kinda botched it with the whole kneeling mechanic (if just it was a little faster like in crouching in fps-style games) but I've got accustomed to it. And like I said before, I hate staff on thief with a passion.
---
Then there's revenant, ele and ranger. I don't really like any of those, and I have them all at level 80 and all elite specs unlocked completely. They can be fun at times, but these moments are rare.
---
Weapon wise I basically loathe sceptres, maces and focus(es?). I just can't stand the aesthetics.
---
I know, my preferences are all over the place, and this is precisely why I've at least given each class &amp; weapon combo a shot, in case they surprise me positively. It's why I've got all classes at level 80 with everything unlocked. So believe me, I've tried. I know what I like and what I don't like. And most of the stuff I like is not favoured by the balancing gods.
---
If you want to put an easy mode then cool. My only argument is that you then the rewards should reflect the difficulty and people should be happy with that. 
---
Also don't assume things my dude I don't play this game enough to bother raid selling lol. I've played the LS story chapter and cleared the new raid once. No point investing more time into this game when others are doing a much better job.
---
We currently have 5 boss fractals, and CM is applied for two of them. I would love to see a proper rework for Solid Ocean, Mai Trin, and Molten Boss fractals that make them in the same "flavor" as Nightmare and Shattered Observatory fractals, with a CM.
---
Short, three bosses back to back, with a challenge mode that makes the three bosses harder.
---
They ruined the potential for a new reward system by just making them gem store only, all while ruining any potential prestige they could have.
---
Nowadays many players don't give a damn about either gliders or mounts, because they have zero prestige.
---
You can still damage with staff, autoattack with Impossible Odds is still good, 2 hits like a truck, and 5 will, if you position it right, fuck people up.
---
Sadly, hosting tournaments and putting ones game on the pro-gaming circuit does not make it a hardcore PvP game. Putting it on a big stage as a competitive esport is nothing short of a marketing gimmick, one we've seen used even in recent titles. Blizzard hosted a $20,000 tournament for Hearthstone's new solo adventure mode, Dalaran Heist. Beyond the prize pool, you could see that they spared no expense in delivering on production quality. Does that make the solo adventure a hardcore game?
---
Further, as I have been trying to get allude to, simply having a single section of your game mode steered towards hardcore pvp doesn't mean the rest of the game needs to follow for it to succeed. Case in point, World of Warcraft. The history of WoW Arena is ingrained in the history of esports, and it is still ongoing to this day. But would you say that WoW, as a whole, is a hardcore pvp game? Having been back multiple times, and hearing recent player frustrations tell me that is far from the truth.
---
People made fun of Guild Wars 2 stint in esports because of the history of Guild Wars' PvP-centered development, and ArenaNet's lukewarm support for the mode, despite it being on the tournament circuit.
---
Wait for a few months. This recipe was known for weeks now and the materials were dirt cheap until the announcement dropped. After the initial hype dies down it will be dirt cheap again as long as Anet not adds to this feature (what is pretty unlikely).
---
You can swap sigils. It was changed easier this year.
---
I'm saying that raids should be kept being made for people who actually want to raid. If the game comes to a state where there are no longer people who want to do that content then yes Anet should stop making them.
---
What has been suggested here is not a raid it is a world boss and we already have plenty of those.
---
Most of those AMAs were bullshit, because they made them right after the patch released, while everyone was playing, and no one could really make questions about the patch itself, because they hadn't played it enough yet.
---
First of all why are you whining about the last 2 pieces being missing (amulet and ring)  as if they're not in development? 
---
Second, I agree with you about the pacing of the releases being annoying and the cost being too high. But I completely disagree with you on each game mode being able to get a unique set of effects. It'll be too much if everyone has a piece from each set and we end up 5 different effects or balls floating around.
---
And I like that the effects stack and build towards something  much less screen clutter.
---
This kinda happened to me before. I sold 1 stack of hardened leather and its gone but i didnt get any money. I sent ticket to anet and they said i sold it for few silvers. Trust the poor me, i DID NOT. And i didnt even get the said silvers. It was not even up on my "recently sold" section on TP, being the only thing i was selling atm. 
---
They gave me my gold back so all is good, but still the only explanation i could think of is that i dc'd for few seconds when its trying to "upload" my leather for sale on TP, so its neither in my bag nor TP, and when i reconnected it couldnt find my leather but remembered the "uploading process" so it said "sell successful bla3" but the leather was..lost, in a blackhole. Yeap, thats what im going with. And thats probably what happened to you, unless you have awesome internet, then i have no idea.
---
if gw3 is a "real" solo game then yeah why not, with a great engine they could do great. If you're talking about another MMO, wont happen.  
---
Tho I would love a COOPRPG like gw1, but with better graphics
---
Blame me for you are feeling i have an mighty attitude, coz i suggest an optional way to get more fun in raids. 
---
You have completely missed GW2's casual attentions with raids, thats why they cant just make the bosses harder, coz allot of players will not be able to do them in that case. So thats why it would have to be some optional activated stuff to make it harder. So from what you write, youre the one with "migthy attitude", and not me :) 
---
And just becaus i like to complete raids and i find it amazing while you dont (as you write), why should that give you the right to come up with an offending attitude?  (just wondering)
---
They could easily bring your characters over to GW3. Not just the names, but also high value items that took you a long time to get. 
---
Your main has legendary armor and a legendary greatsword? You get similar items in GW3 the moment you log in.
---
Blame me for youre feelings about i am having an mighty attitude, coz i suggest an optional way to get more fun in raids.

---
If he did, then I would challenge you to back these 'facts" with proof. Say, for example, what proof is there that Colin Johanson was fired from the company, let alone fire in response to the bad reviews of Heart of Thorns?
---
I have not gotten the salvage-o-matic and I consider myself as semi activ (duing dailys every day and occassional farmtrains in dragonfall maybe twice per week) and I still have around 40 of each due to salvaging. It heavily depends on what you are playing.
---
Meanwhile charrs live perpetually in clip hell
---
If tht's what they want, ArenaNet should make the NPCs who accompany you start doing actual damage, so even the worse players can get carried by the game itself.
---
No it isn't you already know a solution exist but also that build templates take full advantage of feature. And there is no lack of future trinkets. They way they're making the runes appears to be that you choose one and then it sets all of them if you want.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I think the main issue with GW2 is interference from higher ups with no experience in games design. It seems to frustrate the staff at ANet even more than it does us.
---
There's nothing worse than an incompetent boss or manager. Don't blame the small guy.
---
Definitely chest piece first then pants, then the rest.
---
But why? For such a tiny minority of players? New kp? So there is like zero chance to expand amounts of players who actually *try* to do cms in the first place? 
---
I tell you one - you better work on making statistics of actual content better at the first place, then it will look lucrative to add more of it. Now cms are just elite club for speedclear loot, aka even if someone wanted to get good and join the party, he can't because he does not have titles and kps. Don't do what employers do with "we want freshly graduated person but with 5 years of experience". It is just irritating.
---
Personally, the game would be healthier if kp demanding and dps shaming would be bannable offense as is in beloved FF14. People would then maybe actually try to play together, to teach each other and to grow amounts of players that can do it reliably, not like today being smaller and smaller club waiting endlessly in LFG for filling their parties with people who don't exist anymore.
---
This will not help until we teach new players early on how to break the break bar, or 2 - 3 fights in the early missions where they have to break the bar in Order to kill the enemy.
---
Meant k not KP. It's not pejorative, people who have over 27k or so are to a certain extent ap hunters, or at least people who do not focus exclusively on pve, which means that they don't focus on fractals as much as I do and most of them dont meet my expectations, from my experience (and I've played with pugs a lot). I am not interested in playing with people who do not care about doing their absolute best in fractals ( I only occasionally use the lfg tool now), and this is why I am very picky, because I get to play with people who have the same mindset as I do. It isn't much to understand that not everyone wants to do their daily fractals casually, and that's why I ask for kp... Some people here seem to take it really personally but there's no reason to, KP requirements work whether you're offended by it or not
---
I appreciate the feedback, I will look into that and give it ago!
---
no
---
Not a single one of those "spend to the mystic forge to unlock new recipe" event was on a timer. The last one took over a week to complete and if neccessary they will leave it running for as long as it takes. The first one was finished so fast because ppl were desperate to see what will happen.
---
Exactly, they're dinosaurs. Get some fresh blood in the team, young people who know how to interact with memes and stuff like that.
---
.You can play condi without staff but power always with staff. Its a great dmg weapon! Autoattack dmg is not bad and heals you for a small amount. Staff 2 and especially the 5 does very good dmg + CC / weakness. And for your sustain and survivability you have a condi clean and block. Just try it out!  
---
In pvp i would play s/s in wvw you can actually play shield and axe aswell as 2nd set.
---
i wonder why people think raiders are elitist pricks, where do they get that from? /s  
---
My advice for anyone that wants to raid, find a good guild so you don't have to deal with this fucking nonsense.  Raids are fun, don't let snowflakes put you off.  There are some great teaching guilds out there and not all raiders are assholes.
---
It's always good to know release dates long in advance, you create hype and more people will log in that day.
---
Now that's an out there look if I've ever seen one. Fashion wars is neat feature.
---
If they at least added other colors to to the celestial infusion set to be bought...
---
Your post is not proper "content" for this sub as well, violating rule 2, 3 , 5. What's the point?
---
&gt;”Colin, the games director, was fired.”
---
No he wasn’t?? He quit and left to found a new company along with a third of the game’s development staff when Amazon came knocking looking for people to throw money at.
---
Only for new players... If you are a veteran with quite a decent amount of gametime you can afford all these things right from the getgo. That is the gw2 paradox. New-ish ppl will complain that it is to expensive, veteran-players will complain that they have still nothing to do after buying all these things on day one :D
---
Scrapping the outposts and the map meta events was the worst mistake, imo. They were one of HoT's greatest things, you could easily know what was going on, and join everyone else.
---
PoF went back to random events spawning in the middle of nowhere.
---
By breakbar points you mean the remaining "health" of the break bar? Neat idea.
---
we need liquid gold from chests/champ bags or something
---
Did my simple comment warrant this blogpost?
---
played over 7,000 hours, ive invested, saying if your at the point were the games direction has you really upset, take step away for a while, no need to put that type of stress on yourself :)
---
There's no need to be aggressive
---
Fair point.
---
Honestly, by now you really shouldn't be surprised that whenever you see the word "Legendary" popup that it's going to involve a lot of gold
---
Oh my lord. Future build templates are of course going to take advantage of the legendary stat swapping feature.
---
It’s why there have been background updates that have actually helped ArcDPS because those updates are meant for the Anet build templates 
---
As for the last part I’m talking about auto setting all your runes after choosing one stat
---
People wanted longterm goals. There you have them :)
---
and suddenly necro is the only viable DPS class.
---
To fix the economy they should "steal" way more for a wide variety of materials :O
---
When I'm the only armor, I call in map chat that we need more.  I've never encountered that kind of hostility before but those people can fuck right off.  Being the only armor sucks and it's too difficult to do everything at once.
---
&gt; Then people would split in population based on whether they want to go with instabilities or not.
---
Just what we need, lol.
---
Great. This correlates to us having to deal with huge messes of auras for daring to want legendary trinkets how?
---
As far as "anet official build templates" they don't exist. They aren't in the game, we have no date, we have no idea when they will actually drop, so don't present them as an available option. To be totally honest, with my faith in anet, they will still be worse than ARC is, so I won't be holding my breath.
---
Define "content"
---
I gave Staff Druid a try. It was okay-ish, but open world pve felt a little slow without proper damage. Sure, I could have to switched my gear around, but that's also somewhat tedious. Maybe build templates might help.
---
How the fuck is posting a reaction considered ”Drama”?
---
Tell us. Im sort of a new player and just tell me. I cant know if i never played it.
---
Technically they all spiked during times of new sinks. Quite hefty for some materials. But you are right. Six months after the implementation the economy for these items will be back to "normal".
---
We have one weapon set in the game that actually scales with your level, although the rarity is rare.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bloodbound_weapons
---
The price and aquisition method is beyond rediculous though.
---
Where you think they're challenging but fair, someone who is playing GW2 the way the op is describing might not find it enjoyable. Some people take the L as lesson when they die, some take it as a reason to leave.
---
There are easier character action games out there with some world exploration elements that might feel a bit better to them. Maybe along the lines of Amalur (though it gets repetitive pretty quick) or Darksiders 3 to an extent. Maybe something like Breath of the Wild would really hit the spot?
---
For MMOs, it could be worth it to check out Elder Scrolls Online I suppose. I remember people highly praising The Secret World for map exploration stuff but I honestly don't know what the state of that game / the "legends" thing is.
---
I stopped playing a few years ago, roughly about when Lion's Arch was destroyed. My original friend circle (with whom I played this game from the very beginning) fell apart. And as I kept playing and they didn't, I realized something: the game wasn't fun anymore. It became increasingly like a chore; something I'd log on at the end of the day to do the dailies and monthlies and hunt someone on WvW.
---
I've tried numerous times to get back into it. I've even felt that itch to pick up an MMO and I immediately thought: "GW2!". But every time, it doesn't last more than a day or two. Which is sad, because I loved this game. I loved logging on to the old Lion's Arch and taking part in my own servers' shenanigans. I loved the heated battles of dungeons, and the people I'd meet and talk to and chat with all the time. I loved the tense nature of WvW and I loved how I could be something truly spectacular; a feeling which I haven't been able to replicate on any other MMO.
---
The Living Story was fun at first, then it became tedious. Then, with the destruction of Lion's Arch, I realized how much I despised it. I haven't done any of the expansions, so I can't speak on that. But it seems like there is truly nothing let to do in the game (at least from what I've seen and heard over the years).
---
I honestly miss GW2 so much, but I can't bring myself to play it again. I hate logging on and seeing my friends list and how nobody has logged on in years. I just....don't know anymore.
---
anet said there wont be another fractal cm ever
---
Ah yes Snowcrows is usually my go-to aside from Metabattle - didn't know that about Metabattle though so I'll be careful with the builds I take from there. Most of the time I just look to them quickly for stat combinations on anything where I'm not take a Berserker's set.
---
I think once I've watched some videos and found a good teaching/practice static I'll jump in and see how I can fare. I've literally never done anything other than DPS before, so it'll be nice to try something where the pressure is in a different area than hitting a damage benchmark (of course I know there's still lots of pressure, it'd just be a nice change).
---
Thank you so much for the help, I feel like I have a lot to take away from this! You've helped immensely :)
---
Except it is now the norm. We shouldn't be saying "it used to be worse so just be happy with how it is". That's just like the older generation complaining to the younger one "Back in my day we had to walk to school uphill both ways blah blah". The point of legendary gear now is not *just* the cosmetics, but also the convenience of it. But it is way too cumbersome to sit there for 15 minutes to stat swap, sigil and rune change every piece to play a different build. The pacing of releasing the trinkets is awful, especially considering we can only make 1 of each, and can't even transmute the cosmetic appearance of it away if we just wanted the convenience aspect of it.
---
Dude what are you on? they literally said that the background updates that helped do stat swapping and skill selection faster were meant for future build templates. Don’t get pissed at me because what Anet is doing
---
Yes I know. 
---
No  it isn’t, there’s nothing inconvenient about choosing one stat on your legendary rune and then confirming the rest to match it automatically if you want. And then saving it to your templates.
---
The fact people cant see the writing on the wall that it's over for GW2 after reading stuff like this is crazy
---
Swtor would like to have a word with you. Biggest wasted potential in MMO history
---
Anet has been wasting this games potential for a couple years now.
---
Also, in GW1 there were [Destroyers of Earth](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Destroyer_of_Earth) which were these transforming spikey wheels. That would be an incredible thing to port over as a Destroyer-themed roller beetle.
---
As a player who owns and enjoys both my trinkets and armors I have to disagree. I made them because I like em, taste will always differ, be it fashion, or function, we speak about.
---
I do agree however that there should be ways to **aquire** trinkets in pvp/wvw. But they got legendaries a while after PvE, so it isn't like it's off the table.
---
People wanted content and communication
---
Well, I read it all. I do agree with all your points, I did feel most engaged pre-HoT and went on a steady decline until PoF where I fully immersed myself in the content again.
---
Up until Dragonfall, I was fairly active (many hours on a daily basis). But that's it.. To me, I really do enjoy the story but honestly, it's getting shorter and shorter and SHORTER each episode and they take longer and longer each release!
---
Now they're breaking PvP and WvW specializations tearing the balancing even further apart - making the poor performing specs worse and overperforming specs better or untouched.
---
The build variety with meta is a very thin line. There's not much build variety. Sure there are variants of meta builds but not many widespread meta builds.
---
Also the game is building on the foundation of elitists that make it much more difficult to play with friends. If a friend of mine wants to join a raid, they have to pull their weight 110% otherwise they're kicked. That type of segregation is what is driving newer players away from the end-game content.
---
Even fractals shouldn't have this type of treatment considering it's not hard at all, it just takes some direction. Yet people are all about having the most DPS even toward support roles which my chrono was. Yes, I ran a boon support chrono and people complained about how my "dps is shit". Well, duh. What is the deal with this community? Back in 2012 - 2015, I never once had this treatment. We had our roles and nobody told us how we should play. The freewill was relaxing and enjoyable. This is what's pushing more and more people into solo / single player open world PvE content instead of joining groups.
---
Either way, this negativity is very contagious to say the least and is what's pushing all of my friends and even my sister away from this game's true content. It's a shame.
---
What ANet IS doing right, is continuing the development of new free content and frequent updates. I do wish they'd release a roadmap of future content releases so we're not left completely in the dark here.
---
You could make a harrier druid build, it'd make fractals permanent easy mode. :D
---
it would still be a step in right direction. we need training like BnS FFXIV have definitely.
---
I am a veteran but can’t affort everything. At least I don’t hve 6k gold.
---
Which is such a strange design approach since after all player skill levels and experience with the content in question do differ. 
---
They manage to let you slowly take off your training wheels with fractal tiers. Why a system like that shouldn't be possible with raids, I have no idea. 
---
I doubt that either new players nor veteran players profit in any way from single difficulty tier raids...
---
the people talking about how easy it is to fake are missing the point of listing requirements; they're there to vaguely scare people that aren't confident away, not to give you a 100% successful filter
---
If somebody is confident enough to fake the kp and join the group then chances are they're likely to be better than half the people with kp anyway, which means that it's not a big loss to give them a chance
---
I think GW3 will only ever happen if they want to make drastic changes.
---
Bring dual classing back perhaps? or have it as a subscription model.
---
That being said, I find it unlikely.
---
because there are no levels of difficulty in raids besides the challenge motes that already have extra mechanics?
---
You are not even asking for more rewards, you just want more difficulty. Well, it's easy, just impose those challenges for yourself. You have many ways to do it. Do the run naked, or without bufs, or try to lowman it. If you can do those you can always record it and come to post it here for bragging rights.
---
This sub: "We want long term goals! We want things we can work for and that aren't in the gem store!"
---
Anet: Legendary trinkets, legendary runes, the skyscale
---
This sub: "No not like that"
---
I can tell someone never played Factions and thinks Cantha is a K-pop island
---
This isn’t a single player one shot game. Imagine thinking that playing a bunch in the past means the future of the game doesn’t matter xD.
---
You yourself said you hardly play this game anymore, I didn’t say you never played I said you don’t currently invest yourself in the game the same way Veteran’s want to. No one is out here telling you that you should play the game meanwhile you’re out here telling others they should stop?? That’s great dude, stop playing. Doesn’t mean the guys who do frequently play the game want to enjoy it. The game is obviously not in a good place, the stupid comments from people like you telling people who actually like this game to just stop playing contributes to the game being shit in the first place(:
---
Got this survey on 2 of my accounts.  On the third account I got a survey similar to this one a month or 2 ago, but that one was a bit shorter.
---
At least somebody who’s smart enough to make that macro is (probably) smart enough to not stand in a huge flashing orange circle tho.
---
Yeah exactly. People in this sub makes it as if gw2 is their life lol. Can you imagine playing 1 game your entire life?
---
GW3 would have to go somewhere GW2 cannot get to easier imo.  Maybe VR?
---
Yea like I've never played it but I wanted to so I don't know what happened in the past and what's going on these days, but like for me if any new mmorpg is coming up with the title of "WOW KILLER", it dies in like couple months instead even tho you're one of the biggest popular culture elements of all time. You gotta act sneaky but at the same the you gotta give players the feeling of being in guarantee that you're actually gonna be a better game than the market leading one. Best example for GGG with Path of Exile like AFAIK they have never compete in words with Diablo, yet they always ended up improving their game and mechanics.
---
But if we don't like the cosmetics, we are just SOL? I can transmute legendary weapons and armour off of their default look so I can still appreciate the convenience aspect of them, and also share these skins on other characters. That's not possible with trinkets.
---
Just ping one of your precursor envoy armor pieces?  That covers w 1-4.
---
God no. Instabilities are the worst thing imaginable. You want to invest in challenging raids then you want to do it by time and putting in an adventure style system that rewards you for a faster clear. Keep the fights consistent so you're not worrying about random ass fuckery that instabilities would do.
---
That's unfortunate, we are on EU :( But there are 100% guilds like that there too. In general I can only echo what others have said - find like minded guilds. If you like PvP, find a PvP guild, if you like WVW, find a WvW guild etc. I can tell you I have made friends in this game that have lasted for years and in some cases became real life friendships too, just like in any other MMO.
---
MESMER'S NEXT ELITE USING BOW CONFIRMED!
---
Me too!!! That would rock!!!
---
But putting a cm on Molten boss or solid (which needs rework anyway) it's less work. Lately Anet don't seem to like working much :(
---
It's cumbersome nature is only one of many problems i have with legendary trinkets. You can't even craft more for other characters. If I want their function and not the design of them I can't even transmute over them. If they plan on creating another trinket for season 5, were still down another trinket. We're really gonna wait x amount of years to finish a full legendary set top to bottom? 
---
If they create two easy trinkets then it's not balanced with the other 3.
---
Can i have a source on that?
---
Heart = broken.
---
Duplicated+Doubled=Dublicated
---
Honestly I don’t see why stretch it out though, there’s so many live service games out there now it’s impossible to keep up, so I like games like GW2 that have dry periods so I can play some other online games or some triple A titles inbetween.
---
I think it’s a smarter move with a slow burn to keep people coming back and spending cash, when you just keep pumping out content and grinds people burn oit eventually and might not come back ever or for years and years, and if the influx of new players isn’t enough it’s just a slow death, look at WoW sub numbers declining for a decade.
---
"Don’t care about raids in this game, the meta was and still is too restrictive"
---
Raid is 10-man content without any lowman scaling. Yet all the content is able to be lowmaned going down as much as 2 or 3 players. Vast majority(if not all) of it can reasonably be done by 7-8 man. Are you sure about the meta being too restrictive in terms of difficulty or elitism when there is plenty of room for flexibility, error, and non optimization?
---
Do note that PoF metas also reward Elegy Mosaics, a minimum of 6 per final event (per day I think?), with possible drops of 6-10 or exceptionally 17-20. They also reward Amalgamated Gemstones (once per day per map), which are valuable even if you decide to go the HoT way.
---
Small tip: if you tag both the final events of Junundu Rising you can get Elegy Mosaics from both.
---
Raid is 10-man content without any lowman scaling. Yet all the content is able to be lowmaned going down as much as 1 - 3 players. Vast majority(if not all) of it can reasonably be done by 7-8 man. Are you sure about the meta being too restrictive in terms of difficulty or elitism when there is plenty of room for flexibility, error, and non optimization? In what ways?

---
Seriously, so many people here don’t work in software for a large company. This isn’t a massive content change but it has impact everywhere and is probably a few months of rolling work
---
Worth noting, there may be a discount with the upcoming game birthday. They often run discounts on various items including living story and expansions.
---
I’m just sad the only legendary trinket we can craft more than once is Warbringer.
---
Scourge of the Dessert.
---
I think the point is that having a third party tool do the work for you because it wasn't done properly in the first place is a failure. Anet did not have a clear idea how they wanted to implement this and have been fumbling trying to add updates to make it better. And when it's easier to just have 5 different sets of gear instead of one set of legendary gear is a failure for legendary gear as it is supposed to be the superior version and offer better convenience, which as it stands does not.
---
That was literally one point, of several, in the op... Not even the biggest one tbh...
---
No it is not. I'm ok with the legendary armors and weapons or even trinkets with some benefits like visual effects but I'm not fine with the idea of giving a full set of legendary runes 3800 gold (yet) while i can get an endless upgrade extractor contract for 2600g.
---
They did at one point and it went nowhere because the team got overwhelmed with their own system. I feel like they took really unqualified people and payed the price.
---
I'd choose guardian. Revenant is a little clunky as a support in my opinion. (Assuming that's what you are referring to in your intro).
---
Tbh, I don’t because I only use the portal if it’s open as I run by.  Otherwise I do the JP myself.  They will get their tips from other people who wait for the portal and they lose nothing by me using it if it’s open.
---
There is so much time people are ready to wait ...
---
&gt; Personally, the game would be healthier if kp demanding and dps shaming would be bannable offense as is in beloved FF14.
---
I know Anet loves to ban people for wrong speech, but they could also try to foster a community where people are rewarded for helping new players. FF14 gives you extra rewards if you finish a run with a newbie.
---
Ah, gotcha. Because it felt like considerably *less* work than that friggin' Henge, and I consider myself pretty casual, if an alt-oholic.
---
Aurene would definitely eat that
---
The main problem with the GW2 engine is that it has a nervous breakdown when there's more than 20 or so players on-screen at once, which as one might imagine is less than ideal for an MMO. Unfortunately the issue is apparently baked pretty deeply into the code, so it would probably be a substantial undertaking to fix it. People also frequently request that the engine be moved to a newer DirectX version (currently uses DX9), but the devs have stated several times that this wouldn't be beneficial to the majority of players and is totally unrelated to the first problem I mentioned.
---
Me and the boys used to do the daily for over a year ro so (year and like 6 months?) The moment they said they wouldnt do another cm unless for multipart stories (like the arkk arc) and started dropping these weird dungeon like fractals with meh bosses muh friends started dropping like flies.
---
Would love to see another propper boss fractal but i doubt at this point it would bring back my friends, and i dont tent to play mmos solo.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
The recipes for the new runes are not out yet, it is all based on pure speculation based on datamined experimental recipe (that was disabled the day it was found as it should not made it into live build ). 
---
Nobody knows what the real cost will be yet.
---
So much that could be done with fractals.
---
 I'm gay for Ensolyss and super horny for Amala, definitely two of the best fights for me.
---
They lose the profit they would get from you if you were fair.
---
Yes
---
GW2 UI isn't that bad, but I have heard that it has a lot of spaghetti code and the people who made it left the company.
---
You know what? That’s fair, actually. I don’t agree with much of the naysaying here, but I do agree with that. There is risk of putting all your eggs in one basket, which is why Anet’s in this tangle to begin with. Lots of promises that are hard to deliver on.
---
Also, not surprised to hear SWTOR’s suffering. I think lots of people were excited about more core content, but I opted out. I was done with paying a monthly fee just to play something halfway functional. At this rate if I went back, it’d be for one of the original stories. (Give me that bounty hunter story any day!)

Dublicated
---
Doubtful. I've barely logged in since the last LS. During Dragon Bash I logged in long enough to do dailies and logged out since there's nothing to do for me otherwise.
---
My problem with anet's aproach with the trinity was that for them what it meant was "hey nuke healers and supports/tanks its all Damage dealers in our game" which i find rather boring. 
---
Plus the encounters being kinda uncreative and having little danger that couldnt be countered by dodge meant that damage dealers were free to do w/e.
---
I think they've said before that trinkets don't use the wardrobe in the same way weapons and armor do, which is why transmuting them is currently impossible. Maybe this'll change in the future, but I wouldn't count on it being any time soon.
---
It sounds like your post can be summarised as you want build templates? Would you still make legendary equipment if you had them?
---
For what it's worth, I think legendary equipment has always been about a high time and monetary investment for a vanity item with some added functionality as an added bonus. I actually think the path to getting legendary equipment (outside of weapons) is an interesting long-term goal, which is something people clamor for.
---
New here. Is the game beginner friendly and simple to learn? Is it grindy?
---
Any and Every healer or Tank build
---
Entirely true is hard to implement.
---
It really depends on how you want to Run things, Rev in general can do so many things. I personally like my Herald Bunker, but you can do support, Power,  and Condi pretty efficiently.
---
Something to remember with Revenant are the skills  are tied to their legend, so there's no mix and match but you can swap between legends allowing you to have twice the skills available in combat.
---
Also pay attention to your Specialization traits, you have 6 trees that play on each of the 6 legends (including Elite Specs) and 1 that gives you bonuses when switching legends.
---
Revenant has an Energy upkeep to watch, weapon abilities and Skills cost energy, so no juice no power, you can swap legends to restore energy or let it refresh naturally. Some of these abilities are Toggled so if you're getting low. Just turn em off for a bit.
---
Anyways that's my (probably more than) ten cents
---
If the enemy are staggered you can push far and farm them on respawn, however if they respawn together I think it is best to just decap far and defend close/mid. However, If you won the mid fight very easily, say you have a good teamfight comp or much better players, then you can force a teamfight far if you are confident you will win, but watch for enemy movement/decaps.
---
But it does depend on many factors and the best thing to do is predict and counter enemy movement.
---
The quest to save the mystic toilet.
---
Imagine setting you and the subreddit up for disappointment
---
If you do the collections of gen 1 legendaries like Bifrost you'll end with paying a shitload more for the precurser than just buying it straight of the TP.
---
Its all good. The achievements are a way to get the precursor of the legendary weapon, wich is basically an exotic that gets "upgraded" with the Gifts.
---
Depending on the weapon you want, the achievements might be the only way to get the precursor, but for bifrost you could get it dropped or buy it on the trading post.
---
I remember when someone was asking for the dogs during the balthazar fight in ep5 to be nerfed because their glass thief was dying and they considered it a failure of the content if they had to abjsut their build to beat it.
---
Same thing with the sniper mission in ep 4 of lw4
---
I am excited for this! I hope we get some new voice lines about all the LWS4 craziness like we did in last years festivals and this years dragon bash. I am also very excited to see the Labrinthine Cliffs again!!
---
Thats how tips work? They do something for you, and you give something in return.
---
If you don't you are being whats refered to in online games as "a leech". Noone likes leeches.
---
The people saying that is just Echo from what they hear. It's frustrating how they just repeat rather than think stuff for themselves.
---
It was published by EA. It never had any potential to begin with.
---
You're fine, the collection is just an alternate way of getting the precursor. Crafting the final mystic forge components first is just like preparing the toppings before baking the cake.
---
1 gold for easy puzzles
---
2 for medium
---
3 for hard/stuff you can't do yourself
---
5 for super hard stuff
---
for gen1 legendaries the achievements are merely an optional, guaranteed way to get your hands on the precursor... that usually costs you quite a bit more than straight up buying it on the TP. these collections have nothing to do with the final crafting process of the actual legendary.
---
"If you can't discuss the subject because you're too stupid, or it proves your worldview is incorrect - report thread as rule violation"
---
yeah, Mystic Mote and Aspect Recipes (1 per Rune or Sigil) seems way more realistic.
---
I also wouldnt rule out additional temporary faucets for lucent motes, charms and symbols to cover for the initial demand spike in the coming couple of weeks, for example from the Zephyrite Supply Boxes.

Look here to know for certain.

T people say there is new content but the content is walking up and pressing F for a skin we probably wont use because of legendary armor.

I'll bring in a pair of binoculars tomorrow!

Good, keep us updated!
---
When that game launched it consumed 6 months of my life. But the player population dropped so rapidly that i was one of like 12 people left on my server before the merge happened. But it was too late by that point. Game was never interesting for me again
---
:DDD
---
Tried pSlb in the golem and did pretty good, went to sloth and got my ass handed to me so hard I apologized before leaving the group. The gap between golem and an actual encounter is way bigger than with classes like dh. Props to the better players that play it properly.
---
... and asks: what your favorite quaggan?
---
[what Anet employees see](https://i.imgur.com/Ys17eF4.gif)
---
Mh but those aren't alerts.
---
It doesn't have to be a CM. Hell, Siren's Reef is arguably harder than both 99CM and 100CM in some ways.
---
The reason why the current Fractal CMs are great is that they're very high quality and the rewards encourage players to complete them daily.
---
I don't care about whether or not future Fractals are considered Challenge Modes or not, I would just love to see something raid-esque (in terms of length and story, not necessarily because of difficulty) like Shattered Observatory but **not** a daily repeatable CM. If the game heavily encourages me to do the new Fractal every single day, I will easily get burned out on it in 2 weeks.
---
To be fair, HoT was too grindy when it was released. They adjusted that a few months later.
---
As for story content  being too hard... I don't know if I should laugh or cry.
---
Nothing, because every time I sent them 1 or 2 gold, they refused and sent the gold back. So I stopped.
---
&gt;Oho. That's no fish. Fish swim with style.
---
Judging quaggan &lt;3
---
Explain it to my friend here. He's a bit dumb. :(
---
This would at least be reasonable, as if it didn’t you’d be better off just grabbing a piece of legendary armor from wvw
---
Content not grind
---
To be fair, it was annoying af at releast. Not hard, annoying. It’s to this day annoying but just easier.
---
I'd friend you but I don't play on NA hours lol.
---
The easiest way to make friends in game is probably WvW imo. You help people scout things and guard camps for a while and keep talking in map chat, it's easy to make friends. But I'm guessing that WvW isn't your thing.
---
Literally 99% of all people do their raids once a week for the rewards and just wish to be done with it. I guarantee you that nobody will bother. Instabilities are almost never fun, and making repetitive content even more unfun with "lol random xd mobs explode and perma daze you xdd" won't make it better.
---
Rather add some nice bonus loot that randomizes every week, giving you a little more zing while doing raids.
---
Thanks for the info
---
What is a hardcore player to you?
---
Good to know
---
While I dont see the Cantha part I think she is really cute and I'm sorry you're getting some really shitty comments on here 💕
---
It's     S U P R E M E     after all.
---
Any chance your armor is damaged?
---
I wouldn't hold my breath on stuff like this though. I keep hearing that the **legendary** armor has had DYE issues from release.
---
Skyscales to gw2 are pidgeons to real life.
---
There is "harder content" that is actually challenging by good mechanics and tight timers, and "harder content" by adding arbitrary annoying bullshit effects.
---
The whole system is awful.
---
ArenaNet is doing horizontal progression so badly.
---
Why is this system another stupid material sink? That makes it almost 100% about gold and leaves the gameplay across the entirety of Tyria almost irrelevant (gold can be made anywhere but no-one is going to farm Orr for it when they can do more efficient farms).
---
This legendary rune system is a massive mistake.
---
Instead of making us craft six individual runes using materials cynically obtained from salvaging other runes, they should have made legendary runes a gameplay goal. Remove the stupidity of rune sets (it makes them harder to understand their stat totals and compare, almost everyone uses six runes and for people who don't it's a chance to replicate the 4/6 split with a new rune) and make runes a single item slotted into a single slot. Unlock new runes by obtaining them, one by one allow us to permanently unlock runes from specific content. This creates a long term progression system that will invigorate content across Tyria a lot more than a lazy material sink for rune salvaging. Earn different runes from achievements, meta bosses, map completion, crafting, map currencies, PvP, WvW, fractals and raids.
---
This would allow every player to engage with the new rune system and more casually access the final tier of our progression system with greater flexibility. It would create a long term progression unlocking goal, some players would stop at a few meta runes, plenty of players will catch them all.
---
I can't stand the legendary system in this game. It's horizontal progression for rich people and it's an opportunity loss for everyone else.
---
No, pardon me. 
---
What I mean is that that gear is scaled to the nearest 10 of your level, round down. 
---
Say you go in for a sword at level 23. The options will all be level 20. 
---
Go back again at say, 56 cause the game has not given you chest armor for 14 levels in a drop. Those karma options will all be level 50.
---
God this sub got absolutely piss-baby whiny over the past week. This is a QoL addition, one that people have been asking for awhile. The implementation may leave a bit to be desired but you're literally complaining they added something to the game.
---
Redditor 1: Everything is too hard to get! Why do I have to spend time getting legendarily and sky scale!
---
Redditor 2: Guild Wars 2 has no meaningful long term content.
---
Hahahaha.
---
dont need it anyway since 99% of game content required Berserker Gear so all u need is Ascended Gear with berserker stat.
---
All mmorpg i have tested were all of playable and enjoyable quality. but i usually stopped playing them after 2 months with gw2 and tera being the exception.
---
just so you understand my criteria of long term enjoyable mmo the 4 things i look for are:
---
\_combat gameplay. &lt;= this is the most important for me.
---
\_little P2W as possible. &lt;= usually i stop playing any games that have solid P2W.
---
\_World population. &lt;= playing an mmorpg on low population server really kill the mmo side of the game. especially on pvp servers...
---
\_everyday enjoyable content. (stuff you can do everyday, not just some content you do once or twice and wait for more next month.)
---
Note that except for gw2 i always played mmorpg as freetoplay. So no WOW or FFXIV.
---
TERA:  (yes but...)
---
wonderfull gameplay. easily won of the best combat gameplay you can get in any popular mmorpg.
---
but in my case i played on a dying pvp server at a time when tera was already dying and alot of servers were fusionned. my server got fusionned with other low population pvp server and it was no fun to run in lifeless pve maps. tho tera boss are very enjoyable to take down in solo or little group as a melee character.
---
tera is kinda wierd because it is one of those game were leveling up is more enjoyable than reaching level max. low pop server means little elite player community which will make it hard to enter endgame dungeons. aside from that P2W in tera feels not very impactfull and there isn't any in pvp battleground as all have the same gear level. not being able to do dungeons, i felt everyday content boring and not worth the investment.
---
Still if you never tested it i would recommend at least to try it once, on the most populated pvp server you can find. don't make the same mistake as me.
---
but that was years ago. i do not know what is the state of tera ATM. i heard its terribly unbalanced.
---
AION: (No.. or not anymore.)
---
i heard it was a superbe mmorpg before it went freetoplay (just like tera \^\^) but i can't tell since i played it when it went free.
---
Gameplay belong to the oldschool mmorpg like wow or everquest. it is clunky and terribly boring at low level.
---
Some class may  be enjoyable to level up the first time but you will get really bored until you reach... level max and play end game content which i did not because leveling and low level combat was too boring.
---
Archage: (Big No.)
---
Cool gameplay letting you build your character by fusionning 3 classes from a dozen available to create unique combinations.
---
Huge open world with pirates, sea battles and custom housing. gliding, vehicles, etc...
---
In fact none of that matters because of the huge grind and pay to win fest archage is.
---
Skyforge: (No.)
---
Original with a mix of hubs to launch missions and few open world maps. fresh design.
---
pvp and classes kinda enjoyable and unique.
---
No noticable p2w element at first but some good pay to progress faster which may lead to p2w after a while because of one thing, no level cap. the more you play the more trait and passive bonus you will have from unlocking new perks and class. also skyforge is way too repetitive after a while. same dungeons over and over just with slightly increased difficulty you must do to continue to level up and unlock other similar dungeons to do...
---
Black desert online: (No unless you want to roleplay a merchant living his everyday life).
---
beautifull game with immersive action combat gameplay.
---
but korean grinding type of mob bashing all day and fishing while afk to be efficient. no level max either.
---
It was a nice experience while it lasted and could have been way more enjoyable if it had events likie gw2 and way way less mob grind.
---
Blade n soul: (Only if you like competitive 3v3, 1v1 tournaments. but my opinion may be a bit biased here).
---
class gameplay okay. pve not that good and dungeons (well those i did) sucks.
---
pvp arena competitive and skill based. tho i played it when it came out here as freetoplay and the game was not very balanced. pve was kinda boring too but cinematics enjoyable to watch. i never went too far into this game so my knowledge isn't big enough for me to make definitive statements about it but what i can say is that it look alike a lot of other korean mmorpg and you wont find the hidden gem in this one.
---
Runescape: (meh :p )
---
Only played it when i was a kid on school computer. didn't do much in it but top 10 on youtube keep mentioning it.
---
i think i didn't forgot anything... or the mmorpg was forgettable enough for me to not remember it.
---
special mention:
---
warframe isn't really a conventionnal mmorpg but the more update there is in the game the more it look like an mmorpg tho the "mmo" part only exist in the hubs a bit like in skyforge.
---
i really enjoyed warframe but its more like an hack n slash TPS action game with rpg elements.
---
and it is quite grindy but you grind for new frames and weapons... a bit like the grind in gw2 for skins and collectible stones but with skins actually holding new powers and stones being totally different weapons.
---
If you get in close take a magnifying glass too!
---
Not sure why someone would take fire water for heal tempest over water air. Fire may be more dps, but as a healer that is not really a big deal. Air provides fury in aura, ie. Perm fury. You can also provide fury with the fire line, however, it requires using both fields (unreliable in group content, the place you’d use healer) as well as scepter (I’m convinced dagger is just stronger for healing due to dagger two as well as not relying on fields).
---
He literally straight our answered how people would cheat a system of randomized instabilities which you proposed. You just have the reading comprehension of a 12 year old.
---
no. you mean making new npc dialogues, interactions ect is easier than changing tooltip on skills and add nu,ber on boss breakbar which exists just are hidden? how can you say this
---
Part of the problem is that GW2 allows people to run absolutely garbage builds that are completely non-functional.
---
Most modern MMOs lock you into something that's at least reasonably viable and reward you with quest gear that is relevant to your class. In GW2 you get clowns that complain about content being too hard because their apostates rifle deadeye can't clear everything by smashing their face on the keyboard.
---
I left the game right in the middle of KOTET, who was the character who went heel you mention?
---
TL;DR?
---
yes, because it was weird and I'm glad he elaborated.
---
It's not even for veterans, it's for rich people. Legendary runes make no sense for the vast majority of players, veteran or otherwise.
---
I'm fine being a leech.  Am I also a leech because I don't give street performers money?
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Hey, I didn't get anything! :c
---
Unless the economy completely crashes, that's functionally the same thing.
---
I completely agree with you on that!
---
Correction, it's not corporate speak, it's PR speak. Corporate drivel is used internally to stop mutiny, PR drivel is user externally to avoid community backlash.
---
tldr: There are players who are invested into the game and players who play to kill some time every now and then.
---
The bigger issue is that it feels like both camps fight for Anet's attention and the second camp is winning.
---
But it cannot beat a bowl of 🇸🇵🇪🇨🇮🇦🇱 𝓚.
---
Which is fine. That creates openings for new runes. Only a handful of times will players mix runes. Those situations can be replicated with new runes (there should be new runes coming out with each raid wing, each episode release, each festival etc).
---
True. I'm in no way an expert on what to run or specific builds, but I dabble with it a lot ( they are functional though, just not optimal ) and I still easily cleared every story instance so far. I honestly wish the game would challenge me at some point to adapt or improve my build but it hasn't happened so far. 
---
Heck, people complained about HoT mobs being too hard, and while they were a bit tougher I still didn't really have issues with them.
---
It's annoying, bc I like to have a challenge, even if it's just a small one. Otherwise I just don't feel rewarded for what I did and it's one of the reasons the story just feels eh to me atm, bc there's never really any stakes or difficulty, we just overcome everything with ease.
---
Got mine and a family member got theirs. To give full responses it took about 20 minutes to fill out.
---
&gt; Swtor would like to have a word with you. Biggest wasted potential in MMO history
---
In terms of setting, yes.
---
But when it comes to the combat, it's a shame that Anet never ended up making it the game's selling point after launch. They made a big deal about it before release, but then kinda forgot. 
---
Anet made the best MMO combat on the market yet doesn't do much with it.
---
What if you put your legendary rune into ascended armor but decide you want different stats? It's terribly designed.
---
I'm just coming back, having not played since PoF release. I'm planning to play my Deadeye, and was wondering what kind of starting gear I should buy for her? My budget rn is about 11 gold. I just started part 4 of the story? I don't know how to explain it without spoiling it.
---
Please bomb the building
---
Honestly, wouldn't surprise me if it happened one day. I wouldn't expect it before they are done adding unique fractals though. 25 unique ones so that there is 1 per tier. Then they can start looking at other things like legendary infusions and fractal armor skins.
---
 I think they've expressed interest in a legendary aquabreather as well. People always seem to forget you need 7 runes, not 6. If you want the full rune bonus to be active in all types of content. But then again #lolunderwater amirite?
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Font_of_Rhand
---
wiki will always be your friend
---
&gt; What happened to the people who wrote it? Did you fire them/they quit?
---
I can only speculate but seems like yes, indeed, there's too few veteran devs remaining, after all the layoffs and other shit happening to Anet's roster. I can easily imagine legacy code from someone who quit being intimidating and confusing to a completely new person. And this situation makes me incredibly sad and hopeless.
---
Complete the meta
---
Every long-term goal that costs decent amounts of gold more or less confirms gold farming as the endgame.  That's not necessarily something I have a problem with, but when a player is unwilling or unable to grind for weeks to get enough gold, it is locking core game features behind the gems to gold paywall.
---
Gotcha covered.
---
&gt; basically in any content you want to play, how is it a grind, if you got so many choices of how to earn it?
---
You don't get it.
---
People want to play new content that has a lifespan of more than 30 minutes, not be sent back to grind 7 years old content for hundreds of hours for trivial rewards.
---
All new runes are relatively easy to acquire and are in no way worth the huge gold sink legendary runes will be.
---
Archeage says sit down and watch a pro at work
---
i prefer the term opportunist
---
What is wrong with you?
---
That’s not funny
---
So, you OP, if you were a company out there to make a profit, who would *you* cater to?
---
I don't think anyone is winning. GW2 is doing a bad job at pleasing all groups except for the ultra casual who see the game as a virtual chat room where you can buy forum avatar cosmetics.
---
Well-put and thoughtful insight into how people treat gaming (and activities in general) differently. It's always been easy to recognize the people who want to "git gud" compared to the people who want something immediately gratifying, but I hadn't thought of how the distribution has been changing in the gaming community. 
---
Do you think that the gaming industry will eventually have to overwhelmingly to the immediate gratification crowd, in the same way that some news publications have mostly clickbait type articles? Some companies like New York Times will continue to geared towards the "git gud"/dedicated reader, but what type of game will fill that role? MMOs are having to tread water between the two, I think.
---
HoT maps can be completed way faster, even more so if you have mounts.
---
The Crystalline ingots are also easier to craft. I have a bunch I've never used because I didn't know what else to do with all the fulgurite I was making.  
---
Incenses take way more time to get in comparison. The choice chest from completing meta events only give a measly 100 trade contracts. It's better to spend those in courie league leather boxes.
---
I payed 30 dollars for the game, therefore I want everything unlocked when I log in for the first time.
---
Gosh............
---
&gt; Most modern MMOs lock you into something that's at least reasonably viable and reward you with quest gear that is relevant to your class
---
See: FFXIV.  You only ever get gear with stats that are for your class, there are no different builds, just item level.  It removes the illusion of choice that you get with other MMOs
---
But that's basicly what I said.
---
As I said, you dont need to play the old content, you can play any content you like to earn them. 
---
It seems playing video games in general is a grind for you...
---
Release Caudecus was pretty cruel. If he's the type of dude to not read patch notes he may not know the  elite  jade units he had with him are now just easy veteran circus guys. And that makes me really sad he hasnt tried again
---
I'll have to make an elaborate post-it note sign.
---
I visited. Got to see the lobby, ride the elevator up and down, and that's about it. Not exactly worth writing home about (because it's a workplace full of secret, now canceled content, I suppose).
---
XIV offers something to everyone and is doing better than ever. Anet is offering just... farm content for people that like buying from the gem store and no one knows if the game even has a future.
---
If we ever visit Cantha, I'd be really curious to see the current state of the Kurzicks and the Luxons and how well their culture has been assimilated into the Empire of the Dragon, and how the imperial unification policy may have affected the fashion of the Empire in the following centuries.
---
Looking at the great houses of the Kurzicks, House Lutgardis resonates with me due to their deep ties to music. Perhaps ANet could even subtly have amusing commentary on jpop/kpop type of stuff slowly becoming popular among the younger Canthan generation as an "underground" alternative to the kind of "socialist realism" classical music favored by the Emperor and/or Empress's regime.
---
&gt; The Lutgardis are devoted to the study and creation of music in all its myriad forms. They are masters of performance and create the finest musical instruments in all of Cantha--for hundreds of years, in fact, no emperor of Cantha has ascended to the throne without the inspirational orchestration of Lutgardis instruments, usually played by the Lutgardis themselves. They use music to cleanse the streams and bring what new life they can to the forest. They are the house of the tree singers--Kurzicks with a special bond to the few living trees left in the Echovald--and they protect them with their song and with their lives. To the Lutgardis, there is a little difference between the two. Their patron god is Melandru.  
---
A meeting between House Lutgardis "tree singers" and sylvari would no doubt be intriguing, and I'd love to see either the violin (as Lady Valette Wi is a prominent violinist in Divinity's Reach) or the [erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu) (a beautiful two-stringed bowed instrument whose sound evokes the feeling of longing) being added as a musical instrument into the gemstore upon Lutgardis introduction so I can finally fulfill my dream of playing songs from Fiddler on the Roof with a proper stringed instrument.
---
As for Canthan classical music, I really hope ANet revisits the idea of a concert hall given hints that the collapsed Canthan district in DR may have had one. Would be fun to see Canthan take on e.g. Chinese classical and opera music, especially if the devs can code the seated audience clapping. I could easily imagine a few fun dynamic events and/or a story instance where we could try to prevent an assassination of a Canthan minister if not the Emperor/Empress themselves during an opera or concert scene with a Kurzick choir similar to Hitchcock's wonderfully shot [Storm Clouds Cantata sequence](https://youtu.be/1CBjxGdgC1w) in both versions of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" film where the music builds up the suspense towards the inevitable conclusion of the piece with that single, fateful crash with cymbals. :)
---
It wouldn't be so bad if the wording of it did not imply that you needed to make 6 of the upgrades to get a full set.
---
Oh sorry, I wasnt aware that you will die of old age in the coming weeks. I hope you lived your life to the fullest and didnt waste it playing video games....
---
Do you have a telescope???
---
Please try to get us some information regarding to the upcoming contents....if any.... D:
---
I would love to have more than 25 so they can rotate in and out from week to week, keep things a bit fresher and less every day/week is pretty much the same.
---
How much do they cost?
---
When you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one. A company needs to have a clear vision of what it wants to do and let the players who synergize most with their vision come to them. Trying to create a game around getting as many players as possible will only end being a shallow venture. (For example see games like Dark Souls, MGS V and earlier, and the like) these are games that say, “We’re going this way. Who’s onboard?” And they do it well. (Well no longer with MGS).
---
Well that and the engine is not ideal for multi core computers as it was designed to work best on a single large core.
---
Thanks Anet. This saddle collection makes me leave you forever.
---
I didn’t ask or wait for the portal, and the charge of the 20 goes unused.  They lose nothing if I use it or ignore it.
---
In addition to what /u/drawsony said, I noticed that with condi builds when I do get overwhelmed and go down it’s much easier to rally because the conditions keep ticking XD
---
Sometimes you'd be amazed how low the bar for player skill can go.
---
Its hard because you have have to pay attention to the mechanic and if you get caught by it you have a high chance of dying if your teammates dont save you. Its the same reason sirens reed is hard you have to deal with the fight mechanics vs just ignoring them like so many other fractals... and they are more punishing when you ignore them.
---
*Go and steal all their secrets*
---
Or a plumbing simulator.
---
Well, not to defend the guy who is probably a big troll, which you fell for like a ditz, but that Caudecus fight can be very disorienting. The entire room around you is spinning and while Im not one to get dizzy so easily, I was feeling very uncomfortable which made my concentration tank which lead to a lot of downs. Its not that its hard per se but that its distracting. Cool but distracting.
---
&gt; CMs title 
---
This is the first thing a person would buy, tbh. And usually CM title is worth something  for a limited time after wing's release, when it still shows that you have initiative ans skill. It was a pretty long time for w5, but a very short time for w7.
---
&gt; (or envoy's herald for wings 1-3)
---
I'm pretty sure I had it way before w5 was released. And the current maximum amount of LI is 2.2k+ What this means, is that 750li can be gathered without even touching recent  content ("recent" means from the last two years, maybe you didn't even play the game during that time), without even doing "hard" w1-4 bosses  too often (or at all).  No good fullclear seriously group asks for LIs now, it is way too vague of a requirement. 
---
What people do ask for, from my experience (and from what I do), are dhuum/q1/q2 decorations. So please, if you join a group,  link what is required in lfg and state you role. Is it that hard? Don't wait until commander starts clawing this information out of you, he has a lot of stuff to manage (and is likely already jaded). If said decorations are required, don't link your LI (yes, people do that), don't link your individual armor pieces (yes, people do that), don't link your sabetha/vge/escort/whatever decorations (yes, people do that), don't throw babyrages in the squad chat. And if you don't have required stuff, then don't join or, if you're feeling lucky, ask commander if you can join with what you already have, preferably in private, without joining. Is. It. That. Hard.
---
use a drone that doesnt need an FFA license with a camera!
---
so does SO. They're boss fractals.
---
Or like my friend whos a Mesmer with a ton of condi stats mixed with soldiers and some zerker and he uses greatsword.
---
TO is legit a fav fractal of mine and alot of my friends think im weird for liking it more than other fractals.
---
Brilliant.  As long as they made a novelty slot that was always on (does not need to be reselected every time you mapped) and did not prevent you from mounting up.
---
Hey, Ive had troubles doing story bosses before... though usually its just me failing hard.
---
Can’t leak content if there’s no content to leak *taps head*
---
That piece of shit was a reason why I stopped doing LS for ages. It wasn't so much that it was difficult, it was the fact that A.Net had the absolutely moronic idea of putting our characters in a tiny room. Fuck that noise.
---
Yours truly,
---
player of max-sized Norn and Charr
---
Aren’t all raid groups 1-2 supports that practice their ass off, that one Druid who can’t keep 25 might, a warr that auto attacks, a heal scourge that goes down more than the dps and the dps that spent 15mins learning the power chrono rotation and act like they are the sole expert on all things chrono....
---
&gt;  and did not prevent you from mounting up.
---
That part is already in the game ;D But yeah the auto activate (togglable) should obviously be a thing.
---
I love anything with a shit ton of well telegraphed attacks. Soulless Horror, Largos Twins, Matthias, Vale Guardian, etc, etc.
---
Edit: Also, get new friends, you do not need that kind of negativity in your life.
---
What did you make it out of?
---
And you want to know one of the main reasons why IKEA is so successful? Because people put more value in products that they have to work for. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect
---
If only GW2 was more like IKEA...
---
**IKEA effect**
---
The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias in which consumers place a disproportionately high value on products they partially created. The name derives from the name of Swedish manufacturer and furniture retailer IKEA, which sells many furniture products that require assembly.
---
The IKEA effect has been described as follows: "The price is low for IKEA products largely because they take labor out of the equation. With a Phillips screwdriver, an Allen wrench and rubber mallet, IKEA customers can very literally build an entire home's worth of furniture on a very tight budget.

I think you may be spot on! (I consider myself a hardcore casual player)
---
I got an idea! Remove pointless stats, stop releaseing more and rework attributes to be spec based and let your attributes come from your spec. Gear can have some basic stats that augment your chosen spec and be a gateway to customize further your class with added bonuses rather than be stat drapes.
---
The design concept of the scourge still baffles me. A class with huge area of effect, that had a lot of instant cast conditions that you couldnt dodge or interrupt and also has so many corrupts that resistance which is supposed to hard counter condition builds just gets removed constantly. I am sure no one ever  played this in pvp before release. If i remember correct pof didnt even have a pvp/wvw  beta weekend anymore. So anet didnt even try to check if some mechanics could wreak havoc in non pve gamemodes.
---
In that case, your meme makes even less sense, because that is NOT the message it sends.
---
i feel this. and it's exactly why i just don't mess with trying to get anything legendary. maybe one day i'll focus on like 1 legendary weapon, but i play way too casually to ever get anything more than that. i've been playing since it started and am still nowhere near getting anything legendary. it's all too unobtainable. i get why, but still sucks.

Don't worry, you'll always find quite a few of us minstrels playing music by hand too like Cmaj whose guild rule is not to use macros. :)
---
As a minstrel of the Mists, I do often stop by at the Fountain of Salt in the Heart of the Mists to play music and soothe the minds of pvp players between their matches. I don't expect tips as I play music to simply cheer people up, but I won't turn tips down either if someone wishes to donate any amount.
---
&gt; If you're up front about low experience and they're willing to help out then that's one thing, but you're not entitled to be carried....
---
So true. I have been in groups where people try to coast by or fake the kp or w/e, those folks get kicked every single time. The act of communicating and being upfront about that stuff instantly sets you above a large portion of players and I like people that do that.
---
Totally expecting ANet employees to appear at your door with either sweet swag or zipcuffs, gag and blindfold.
---
I'd take out the rune and swap stats maybe, ofc depending on if I want to change gear stats more often - in that case I'd need another set of gear and just swap the runes between the two.
---
Getting ascended armor is much faster, than getting the legendary armor.
---
The stat thing is more important still
---
I do think PoE's system is better but there is a crucial part of the system that is not possible(I haven't thought that much about it though) in GW2. The fact that the maps are tradeable. In PoE it allows for the "one man's trash is another man's treasure" situation because a combination mods that can be horrible for one build could be free loot for another build.
---
If they include the gift in OP's picture, more than 3600 gold
---
Honestly, the ability to make poor choices and fail is a good thing, because it makes the correct choices and success feel so much better.
---
The problem is, GW2 doesn't really try to guide people in the right direction and most of the fights are so easy you're unable to fail.
---
IF there was a barrier to beating content AND the game did a better job at teaching you to overcome that barrier we would have a game that's more fun and rewarding for nearly everyone.
---
Did they close the blinds to avoid communicating with you across the street?
---
It's made with foam, hot glue and floral wire which are bind to a hair reef
---
It's always lovely seeing you PINK and other kind mesmers around to help port people, and some of you even spreading the fun harpy love effect around (particularly Strze). I personally prefer to jump through the entire jp by myself, but you helping people out is very commendable. So, if you ever have a sylvari playing music at the end of a jp near PINK, that may be me cheering all you mesmers up with sweet tunes. :)
---
Getting legendary armor requires much more dedication than just farming gold and crafting runes. Anyways, I was just guessing why would we need the legendary runes.
---
(If the 6 pieces would cost that much, I'd go for it no doubt about that, but currently it has a too high cost for just 1 rune or sigil.)
---
Totally imagined Rie saying that.

Now's your chance!
---
Those groups nobody forces you to join while you can extremely easily make your own group? :O
---
So grinding is meaningful long term content, for you at least.
---
Not sure that's right.
---
Oh so it let’s you have any rune “set”.... honest question why do we need this?
---
Legendary armour already gives you this functionality at a cost of a few bag slots. And by the looks it will be cheaper to get legendary armour.
---
If this was a truly customisable item then it would be worth every copper. But it’s not.
---
1: Your separation is super wonky. Those that play games to pass time might still see it as hobby, and those that get good at games might still do so because they have nothing better to do.
---
2: Games were always made for profit. 
---
What is different today is that 
---
a) a lot more people are into gaming and internet communication has made it so that people can crap on the developer's doorstep when they don't want to improve. A long time ago, you bought a game and were stuck with it. If you wanted to beat it, the idea to ask devs for adjustments seemed ridiculous, so you just raged around and had a friend help you until you finally got it.
---
b) Games as a service (e.g. Guild Wars) provide a lot more feeling of entitlement, because you don't just buy a game, you "support a game", and thus you feel entitled to raise your voice and influence the development process, regardless of how subjective your opinions are. 
---
c) People are given incredibly easy ways to piss away their wealth. Of course, when people are willing to pay 1000s of dollars, they will get the preferred treatment. It was just that, back then, nobody would have expected people to ever be so stupid, and thus games had one, firm, reasonable price tag. Nowadays people throw their money out of the window and get aggressive when you tell them that it might not be the best idea - because it's their business. But when your wealth and spending behaviour shapes an entire industry to the point where gambling boxes are a main form of progression, it's not your business anymore. 
---
Just like with everything else in this world, many people out there are thoughtless, greedy, comfortable fucks who don't think more than half a step ahead. And I think this applies to all of us in some shape or form, it's just being human. But it is ruining many games, and the trend will get a lot worse before it gets better. 
---
The web has killed gaming as we know it, and it ain't coming back.
---
IMHO, Im completely fine with story difficulty. I dont play a story for the challenge. I play it to enjoy it and if Im dying a lot, even if I could learn, I would find it very frustrating.
---
Not that Im saying that I dont like a good challenge along the way. God knows how many times Ive played a game where I get stuck hard only to finally beat it after hours of trying and I let out a loud YEAH! and I fist pump the air. But its never the one reason WHY I do anything. Its just not my cup of tea.
---
Also. FUCK A CRACK IN THE ICE! That was not challenging!
---
TIL there are people that think setting requirement for a group you start should be a banable offence. Next it will be asking for exp people or for people to use pots/food because falls under the same thing as asking for proof of prior exp.
---
The dps shaming people you dont want to play with anyways just ignore them and move on with your day.
---
Just means I get to try all the horrible rune sets I never wanted to before. :D
---
Set up a camera, you are now our best source of structured dev updates.
---
There's no way a single rune is going to cost 800g to make.  Sure prices of certain items will spike for a little while, but they will eventually come back down.
---
When you then see he ist pvp lv 300 something you get to ask yourself how can somebody not improve in that time xD
---
They just like different things than me and thats okay.
---
But you can check them outside of the game.
---
That is a decent starting point but you still have to teach people not to spam all their skills on cooldown. None of OP's suggestions is going to do that.
---
Or a table simulator!
---
I don’t follow „narrow play patterns“ and would still be able to craft this if I wanted to. Without spending real money.
---
yeah awesome idea, so I encounter a boss solo, before the squad reaches it, and the breakbar will be instantly wiped  whenever its up. great idea mate"!
---
While tipping isn't a necessity per se as most mesmers port folks up out out of the kindness of their gentle hearts, I do feel the absolute minimum for anyone wishing to use mesmer services is a simple "Thanks" or "ty" in chat given how much time the porting may save from a player's gametime.
---
I've rarely used ports as I prefer doing most jps by myself, but on the few times I've used ports for some of the really difficult and lengthy jps with checkpoints like Chalice of Tears, I've tipped 2 gold or more for the time the mesmers have taken to get folks through.
---
When I arrive at the end of a jp, I do tend to play music with my harp for a few minutes or even an hour depending on the circumstances to reward the mesmers who have helped others port up. It's a fun way to promote a sense of community and make the mesmers' sometimes monotone routine of porting and waiting for cooldowns more bearable. :)
---
you need telescopic lens ...
---
If it wasn't already obvious.. the runes are in alphabetical order..
---
I really hope it's fake, Funko Pops are ugly af. I'd rather have a quality statuette for twice the price or more that I can proudly display. Dead Aurene, Joko monument, Mouth of Mordremoth, Balthazar... I'd shill some serious money on those.
---
Well I’m no longer gonna sleep tonight.. thanks for the nightmare
---
Ive done the whole story by myself, and I am by no means a pro or anything. Some of them were hard, but none were so hard that I thought to give up. Just power through them and meh, no big deal.
---
Except most people wouldn’t start a no KP group because those tend to be three hours to maybe clear 100, and probably not even moving on to 99 or t4.
---
Jade BS and the spontaneous Bloodstone mechanic aside (as those are reasons folks could understandably fail), the super tiny room and the hatefulness the camera had for it was a big reason reading the fight was difficult.
---
I mean this is optional.  You don't have to make them if you don't want to.  However if you do plan to make them, you better be ready to farm.  Saying you want to get them, but without farming for the materials required, is like saying you want to go swimming without getting wet...
---
Only because of the larger franchise, the game itself was dogshit from the start.
---
Arcdps will switch out legendary stats  and runes in about 3 seconds.
---
And yet my girlfriend would go nuts for a funko pop. Huh, its almost like people have different taste!

That's welcome news! Thanks for passing that along... I might have to finish it up after work tonight.

---
Not a leak. It comes from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDcOY_i_tsg
---
It's not fake, just don't buy them if you don't like Pops. Not everyone can afford statues, so having a GW2 figure for 12 bucks is pretty decent. Funko has improved a lot with their designs, just look at their Monster Hunter line. Great detail.
---
You didn't even have to play a boss per tier.
---
I arrived late at fire elemental, shot it a couple of times and got full credit for everything when we hit T5
---
Never played it and don't care to switch from GW2
---
That's legit, although I think this sub might have more of the "casual++" players who aren't quite so hardcore. They're more interested in the game and may want that gear but feel it's still out of reach., whether or not we agree on if they "need" it.
---
I think the feeling of grind vs the reality of it may still be applicable in these cases.
---
I know this might not be popular, but I think ArenaNet is a company that likes their "safe spaces". Whenever you see or hear about how the studio works, it's all very nice and safe, but very insular. I do wonder if there was a bit of an echo chamber happening there that maybe developed a them and us situation (ArenaNet vs the fans), and they really holed up when they couldn't deliver on some of the features they had said may be coming in the future.
---
MMOs are successful because they are community driven, but that community isn't just the players, it has to include the developers too. We're all invested just as much, cutting yourself off from the playerbase because you don't like "negativity" or "toxicity" is what leads to the situation we're in now re. lack of communication.
---
I may be completely off the ball there, but that's just the feeling I get.
---
As someone who used to be a hardcore figurine hobbyist, I wholeheartedly agree. Funko Pop look hideous for their size. Just look up "nendoroid petite" for quality comparison. And people will still happily buy them due to the undeveloped tastes/low standards..
---
&gt; ...the ability to make poor choices and fail is a good thing...
---
Preach!!! Imo the best games allow alot of player freedom and with that freedom comes the possibility of doing things badly and failing.
---
Yeah, I agree. It's just harder to make a game with genuine variety, because it requires sufficiently complex gameplay so that optimizing builds is very complicated or just not possible (situational)
---
The NPC isn't using the same armor ...
---
&gt; FUCK A CRACK IN THE ICE!
---
whats your beef with a crack in the ice?
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Leek
---
I would contact support about it. Imagine they get deleted, or the recipe is changed, and you just lost hundreds of gold coins for nothing.
---
*logs in and still has 300 ping*
---
I have a pop diablo and it's amazing!
---
I dont understand why my comments are getting downvoted, I get that people like other styles of figures, but why not let other people enjoy Pops too? Just because it's not your cup of tea?
---
&gt; Also (Optional) add divider every 200/300 points for clarity.
---
Event scales to 40-50 people. Nothing but divider bars exist. &gt;.&gt;  Starting at about 10 players, the CC burden *per player* goes up, and overall bar HP goes up over 500 per 5 people. 
---
Also, the effectiveness of soft-CC goes down with scaling. The damage each Soft does per second is static (ie, 20 for Weakness, 50 for Slow), instead of rising proportionally to help cover increase each player needs to commit.  
---
But also yes, some sort of UI information on blue-bar damage would go very well toward helping players understand. Maybe even give the bar a shake and a little blip of light when the player does damage to it. Whatever is needed to make the impact better conveyed.
---
A heart felt TY
---
I loved the idea of SWTOR... But I couldn't get past the bouncing 'smooth' camera, so I quit before I even finished the starter area.
---
Hope up for a template eventually but this looks real bad. And the announcement worded terribly imo.
---
Weren't there some datamined codes implying the **legendary upgrade** would be transformable into any rune or sigil? If that's true, I wouldn't be surprised if you need both charms and symbols.
---
I think you may be right bro.
---
If they ask for tips, usually I don't.  
---
If they don't, I tip from 5-15g depend on how easy/hard the jp is and how they're treating me ^ ^
---
I have that one too! That was a great line.
---
grindy, hard in the same sentence when referring to gw2? oh boy these are desperate times.... i mean wait till they play dark souls or some asian mmo...then they'll see hard and grindy.
---
Praise Choko!
---
With the change to Impact Savant, I've been toying with the idea of a power scrapper build—naysayers begone XD—for pylon control at Qadim the Peerless. Two questions:
---
1. Would the rifle's Jump Shot be enough to grab the energy orb and return to the pylon? Or would I need to take Rocket Boots? Right now, I have my build configured under the notion that Jump Shot + Gyroscopic Acceleration will suffice.
---
2. Should I take Bomb Kit despite the fact that its only use while my pylon is up is Big Ol' Bomb? Or should I take something else like Rocket Turret or Throw Mine? Idk. Those don't seem stellar. Or Elixir B so that I can give myself nearly perfect Object in Momentum uptime (with help from Gyroscopic Acceleration)?
---
Right now, I'm taking the same exact gear as [rifle deadeye](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/deadeye/rifle/) and am using the following: Explosives: 3, 2, 2; Firearms: 2, 3, 2; Scrapper: 1, 3, 3; A.E.D.; Grenade Kit; Bomb Kit; Elixir B; and Elite Mortar Kit.
---
&gt; It started with the "removal" of the holy trinity and replacing it with nothing. Roles aren't there to make you wait longer when a role isn't popular. They are made for balancing and to make group setups easier and faster.
---
Holy trinity killed GW1. Even in 2007 people were waiting around for an hour to do a mission because they needed a monk.
---
The biggest issue for me on that fight was the room it took place in.  The small space really messed with the camera at times, which was irritating for me, but for my friend with motion sickness made it completely unplayable.  I had to do the fight both for myself and again with her as a tagalong because the janky camera angles caused by the enclosed space made her puke.
---
The only grindy part of HoT was some of the collections, which are often skipped by most players anyway. People were just upset that you couldn't hit mastery cap in a day or two.
---
Pretty art, post more! Would make nice emoticons too.
---
So I have to follow the meta events as they unfolds? Or at least jump on the active event and follow the flow until I get access to the font? I've also red that the small dungeon behind the portal requires more than one player to be beaten
---
Just use the PvP interface.
---
tbf, HoT masteries were really grindy when they were released, especially compared to LS3 and PoF ones
---
BECAUSE ITS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD
---
Nah, people are just toxic fucks.
---
I have over 1700 Elegy Mosaics, mostly due to the change to the PoF metas recently.  Getting them daily from Pinata/Junundu/etc. adds up quickly.  I'll definitely be using them to make my next Legendary weapon.
---
POPs give me nightmares.  
---
Should've made a deal with GSC to make Nendoroids instead.
---
SWTOR idt just a cashgrab at this point. Barely any content, but new visual armor sets. They cost about 15€ up to 45€, just for a new outfit without any stats.
---
But they sure look great...
---
quality shitpost xD
---
I just wanted to finish my single player story. That was great. I really enjoyed it. But fuck me that game has to be the next best thing to literal, actual cancer. I was genuinely shocked by its state and uninstalled with a slight sense of dread.
---
I'd buy both tbh
---
It's even funnier when you realize just how average most of these players are in the CM pugs. Most of the dps players I see are only pulling ~40-60% of the damage they could be doing, CC is more-often-than-not lacking, healing is hit-or-miss, etc. and the groups will still clear with minimal issues.
---
I don't understand why people think these players are elitist lol, it's become a rather casual activity over the last 2 years.
---
maybe that's why it's been taking them two years :P
---
Caudecus is quite the bullet hell. Don't underestimate that shit.
---
&gt; designer to developer
---
Those words both refer to the exact same people so I'm not sure how to interpret your point. Can you elaborate? Everyone working on the game is a developer. "Designer" is a job title like character artist is, so a designer is a developer.
---
Oh yeah, you gotta turn off Gen chat immediately. It is TOXIC. I’ve seen racism, transphobia, homophobia, xenophobia, political debate, etc...there is no community of that game that isn’t just laced with nastiness.
---
I absolutely don't want memes, don't get me wrong. I just am seeing an increase in these huge posts and there's never any insight in them that hasn't been covered in another thread! It's just people wasting everyone's time repeating the same shit multiple times to get karma and make themselves feel like an expert on community management. The worst is when people put fucking headers over sections of their post like it's a goddamn thesis paper. Jesus Christ, man, get to the fucking POINT.
---
Also, not wanting to have to slog through all this text is not just wanting memes, man, come on. You can be more concise in what you're saying. You don't have to lean on the crutch of delivering a grand sweeping narrative. Gaming populations have changed and ANet embracing and then letting go of "hardcore gamers" via raids and PvP tournaments has led to the game being torn between appeasing two types of players that see each other as the enemy. Boom, there you go. I didn't need to go on a guided tour of the 80s gaming scene. This could have been a comment on one of the dozen other diagnosis posts.
---
Im trying to explain how some players could find those things "hard" or difficult. I am not talking shit about the fights or saying that they actually are. I am in favour of people having to do more than roll thier face across a keyboard to clear grp content.
---
The f2p thing is completely false advertising.  It's a sub game with an optional "free to try".  Trying to play it without subbing is painful. On the other hand, just 1 months sub fee gives you access to everything including all expansions.  They should just stop with the f2p nonsense and make it a limited trial like ff14 or something else less disingenuous.  For someone who has never played it before and likes a story driven mmo, I'd still say its worth at least a months sub for the class stories alone.
---
It's speculation. If I'm wrong then I'm wrong, my bad, but it's not a stretch to guess that legendary upgrade components will use the Gift of Upgrades
---
the boss thats scaled to 5 people by default because theyre group events? Pog.
---
The people are British?
---
"We want our of Europe"
---
"How?"
---
"We don't know" 
---
:D
---
Same. I wasn't rude or harsh, but I had some looong paragraphs and bullet points.
---
I was actually looking forward to having better stats on sigils, like the jump from exotic to ascended....guess it's even more stacked convenience now rather than actual better stats :/
---
Yeah, the class stories are honestly the best part of the game. Maybe the expansions if you wanna feel like more of a badass, but even then they’re not...they got plot holes galore. Core story is great. I personally recommend the bounty hunter story, first and foremost. It got me into Mandalorians and their culture and drove me to the norn in GW. Either that, or Agent is great if you want the ride of your life. Still haven’t finished that one.
---
If you want to play a Jedi/Sith you could go for any of them. All of them are decent. I actually liked Consular, but ymmv.
---
Overall if you wanted to try the game though, you’re better off paying for one or two months and trying class stories. Not worth picking up again unless you’re REALLY into it, or want to replay a story.
---
I don't seek help from jp porters because I someone I can rely on porting me whenever for no cost but if I did I probably wouldn't think of tipping them honestly. If I was a jp porter I wouldn't expect a tip either honestly, more than anything I'd appreciate some alacrity honestly
---
I just didn't understand it, I dont care if people do it.
---
TO is... both good and bad
---
Early part of the fractal: Good
---
Boss phase: ...Mix of good and bad. Some phases are fine, but some phases just become a clusterf- Mostly the Dwanya and Grenth phases. Everything else isn't too bad, but I wish that they calmed down a little bit with the effects, and made things a liiiittle bit more telegraphed.
---
Now start a window post-it war.
---
You pay for goods and services to who ever you buy that shit from. They take that money and pay their employees. If you choose to tip someone for any reason thats cool. Tips are not (imo) mandatory for anything. Ever.
---
Pretty much. It is not safe for a gay transgendered foreigner...which is to say me and the friend who introduced me lol.
---
It's doable solo, I actually did this just this morning.  Took a couple of tries to figure out the mechanics.
---
There's more than 10 weak points to target across the two phases you have to do it.  However, Aurene will be moving and has line of sight, so you have to choose carefully which to attack.  It takes three shots to destroy a weak point, so target one that she won't move past before you can fire three shots, then target another one after you've fired the third.  The next one you target likely shouldn't be the next nearest one, or else she might pass it before you can shoot three times, which in turn makes it harder for you to hit the next one in line.
---
It's probably easier with a party if everyone gets to fire their own shots, but it can be done solo if you follow the above advice.
---
Superior Vigor was 30-50k when I played, and was by far the most expensive part of a "perfect" gear set. Blue 20/20 weapons could be purchased cheaply from vendors and 20/20 greens could be had for a few plat. Ascended gear is massively more expensive in comparison and shouldn't exist. Same goes for infusions
---
Usually 1g.
---
One-handed spears, and two-handed polearms!
---
Yup. We make decisions emotionally and then rationalize them with whatever is in front of us. When confronted, most people go "meh, doesn't change my mind" instead of rethinking their stated reasons, because the truth is that the stated reason is probably not the real reason.
---
I did, but then i realized they wouldn't say such a think like this:
---
" Legendary runes provide the same set bonuses as other runes, and you can combine them with exotic superior runes. For example, if you have a Superior Rune of the Adventurer in your helm, and you add a legendary rune to your boots, setting the legendary rune’s suffix to Adventurer will grant the two-piece bonus for that set. "
---
Like what's the point of combining the same type of two runes (1 exo and 1 leggy) if you're gonna obtain 6 of the same leggy rune by one Gift of Upgrades?
---
Hahahah you think GW2 is bad for that? Did you play GW1?
---
I'll take a newbie build in GW2 any day over the useless nonsense possible in GW1.
---
what about gw2 expansions are meaningful or long-term, lmao
---
I finished literally everything in PoF besides a few achievements like the shadow seals one within 2 weeks tops.
---
&gt;When you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one.
---
Not really, you can please everyone, as long as you make sure your content can be played by any of them, on their own distinct way.
---
Difficulty modes, sandbox/survival modes, open world pvp yes/no, etc. The same content, but with different approaches you can choose between.
---
almost double the price of legendary armor
---
Usually 1 gold is my go to for usual jps, they are investing their time to make things easier for me.
---
For the super hard and annoying ones (Chalice of Tears... Cry) that need multiple steps and is more intensive/time consuming, I will tip aroung 5 gold.
---
Set up a guild cats/treb and a guild AC!
---
This looks delicious
---
Praise Joko!
---
using them to supplement existing sets, perhaps? It'd be pretty foolish for them not to work that way.
---
See I love the boss phases, all of them. Its fast paced lots of things going on, you have to move around the area (most fights you fight on one spot) you have a sweet special action that stun breaks and lets you avoid dmg (jump over things). Plus there are lots of ways to make the fight easier for the grp and not all of them have to be done and can be handled in a variety of ways.
---
Nice, none of the people I know truly fit into either of your categories. But good job at trying to see the world in black and white.
---
Nobody would ever stick to playing soccer if they hate it.
---
I liked raids, "getting better at the game", I don't really care about the story. But I don't consider people that love story, lore and casual gameplay instead of raids as "people that don't have fun and just want to kill time". They might be more invested into GW2 than I am.
---
Look for a leak!!!!
---
That fight has a number of absurd things happening in it... While I feel like you probably ran into a troll, there are some criticisms worth leveling at it.  
---
The biggest one being the room itself.  It's rather tiny, Caud himself takes up about 1/3 of my FoV.  
---
On top of being tiny, the camera collision seems to be based on something that isn't flat shapes.  When designing something in that narrow of a space, the camera simply can't be getting hung up on random objects that have no part in the fight itself.  
---
The actual fight mechanics don't help either.  Caudecus has a skill that you have to interrupt with the special action button... If he casts this skill successfully you are knocked back at least THREE separate times and dealt one-shot level damage for most classes I've done that fight on (zerk builds cause pve).  The tell for this skill charging is not terribly obvious given that you have to be keeping an eye out for the constant and unending spam of bloodstone explosions whose CC will ultimately lead you to eat the big hit and die, but they also can't make it too big because you're in a rather tiny space and it won't do you any good if you eat a bloodstone shard to the face while you're fishing for your special action key and unable to see the aoes because of the tell.  Lest we forget that his other damage is rather high, tends to be focused on you and there are enough strikes constantly incoming that you will NOT have enough blocks or evades to not take damage.  (This does not make it impossible though)  
---
Now toss in some adds every 25% health and we now have a grand mess on our hands.  The removal of the jade construct from the fight was a godsend but that doesn't fix the issue of the occasional fucking clown rifeman appearing who also does 1-shot level damage.  When there is no marksman, there is no problem.  
---
I personally have managed to finish it every time without leaving the fight naked for broken gear, but I can absolutely see where someone just wanting to run the story and not interested in stepping up the gameplay is not going to be happy about that mess, and similar ones that happen later (I bet that guy the OP ran into would quit the game after the Bullet Hell boss from LS4 e2).  
---
It really is an incredibly poorly designed encounter that I feel could be mostly fixed if they could get the camera situation hammered out better and they would announce to people to put their special action button somewhere that doesn't suck as badly as the default binding so that they don't fall victim to the massive "eat shit" mechanic it's meant to stop.
---
They only accept carrier bee dogs.
---
I disagree I went back with no armor and did the caudecus fight and I died once the respawned and finished killing him because it didnt reset.
---
They just need to change it to the way pvp armor/weapons and amulet/runes are.
---
Yeah when I'm porting I never ever ask for tips. Just seems tacky to me. That said, I won't turn it down either! (Unless of course it's clearly a newbie and they're gifting me a gift that is better used helping them...I've returned those pretty regularly).
---
When I'm the beneficiary, I base it on how difficult the JP is and how much time and difficulty they're saving me. Grenditch Gamble? No tip. That big one in Southsun? That's a gold.
---
I just hated the ice eles in the open world area. Let your guard down fpr a split second? You're now a PCsicle.
---
yeah, I'm thinking of it in terms of being a stopgap for stuff like nightmare runes that someone might be working on sets of or smth. I doubt amybody actualky runs with half sets.
---
Well uhh, I don't know whats wrong on your end specificalyl then, because I sure didn't make it to be that way. You seem to be the only person having any sort of problem like this too
---
No core condi guard pepehands it can do 28-29k :(
---
&gt;	Or until the aliens released from area 51 overthrow the US government.
---
I think that happened a few years ago.
---
Send them an owl and ask them when the next expansion is due to drop
---
Why do you say that exactly? What do you find in bad shape about it? It’s not my main mode of play, but when I do play it, I really enjoy it.
---
i started playing games in the 80's, i had to load cassette tapes both sides to load a game, before moving to pc single player games like wolfenstien, spear of destiny, doom 1 and 2. then the whole world opened up for me with hundreds of titles and i played all the classics. i got a modem and joined bulletin boards and played online with death matches and co-ops
---
as i got older i got adsl internet and started playing mmo's, got good, joined a raiding guild in swtor, did lots of pvp. but when i got to this game i became really casual, i barely touched raids and wvw and never pvp. swtor burned me out for harder co-op content and this game invites casuals. i am in a comfortable place. i suppose if i wasnt working 5-6 days a week right now i would be raiding
---
but right now i fit into the other category. i play this game to waste time
---
Yep, it’s only survivable with gen chat off. Especially if you’re playing the one US server. The server merge was NOT a good thing for us...
---
I don't understand the hate OP is getting here. I also spam captured this scene cause it DOES make an amazing screenshot. I bet a lot of people did.
---
Do cutscene screenshots not count or something to you? Why? It stills look pretty. It still uses the thing the game provides. I could easily stand on a ledge but without all the beauty this scene captures. They are happy with it, there is no need to hate on the OP for it. Or heavily downvote them for responding.
---
Hey OP, love the screenshot, That was one of my favourite moments too.
---
Grinding gold isn't content, it's a lazy way to make things "earnable" that supports the fucking travesty that is GW2's loot system (blues, greens and yellows that no-one ever equips yet they endlessly drop).
---
Compare the legendary upgrades to how WoW has handled the essences for BfA's necklace mechanic. All over the world players can acquire essences (which are essentially runes) from different content. Some come from PvP, or raids, or world quests, or dungeons etc. Different essences are obtained from different places and they reinvigorated the expansion and all the content players played.
---
Legendary upgrades will be irrelevant to 95% of players who know the gold cost of them is absurd and pointless.
---
Thanks man, and yes it was a great ending. But honestly fuck the haters 😂
---
Focus on getting some cheap berserker gear (for power DPS) for the time being. Named armor sets like [Nika's Armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nika%27s_armor) for medium, it's super cheap,you can buy it right away, and it comes with a set of runes already (not the ones you'll want in the end but good enough for now). [Check out this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) for more details on where to get cheap/free gear and use [one of these sites](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) to find a build to use. Like the gearing guide says though, exotics should be what you're focused on for weapons and armor and you can try to go for ascended trinkets if you have easy access to them (can also get the berserker only ones pretty easily). Also if you need more gold you can do your daily achievement for 2g/day and lots of the daily meta events have great rewards ([you can check the event timers here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers)).
---
That’s generally a way to get people in position, at least for the very beginning. Communicating that no one is going home is a pretty big thing, especially in the first 30 seconds of the game. It prevents a 1 - 3 - 1 split happening where you would lose at minimum two points because you’re spread too thin.
---
Imgur showed me [this](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/LZ5S3PW) underneath it and I don't know how to feel about it
---
kill proof
---
If people didn't share anything just because "its been posted before" then every damn subreddit based around any form of media would be dead.
---
&gt; Scrapping the outposts and the map meta events was the worst mistake, imo.
---
Classic Anet bouncing between extremes. A lot of people don't like that Dragon's Stand is 100% reliant on the meta, so they interpreted that as people don't like map metas and just flat out removed them from PoF.
---
"All Holosmith attacks have had their damage reduced by 30% for purity of purpose."
---
Damage/Control/Support is a meaningless trinity though. As I said roles are a balancing tool and make creating setups for groups a lot easier (especially for pugs). That trinity does nothing in that regard since these are not actual roles and it's very noticeable considering the history of GW2 endgame PvE content.
---
I have no clue why you think this. They even listed the season and episode it is from. Please tell me where they said they were taking credit from the devs.
---
People are taking the word "made" as in they hand crafted this. THEY SAY IT'S A SCREENSHOT, THEY LISTED THE SEASON/EPISODE. 
---
The word they were probably looking for was "taken", not "made". But nah, let's all hate on this for a single word choice when it was clear they just took a pretty screenshot from the final episode and shared it cause they loved it. Well after this post, they'll probably not want to post again due to this backlash for such a small thing.
---
These are objectively some of the best screenshots in the whole of GW2, due to how beautiful the scene is. I had no clue people on GW2 were so hoity-toity about the particulars of a screenshot. So only open world screenshots count to the screenshot police?
---
I've been super frustrated by story bosses, but I just keep trying until I get it.
---
There are many aspects of the game I quit doing because I don't enjoy ~~failing at~~ them. However, you will not see me bitching about them on reddit or in map chat though.
---
My GW2 policy is to take what I like and leave the rest.
---
250 of each is like their standard for legendary components and gifts.   Most legendary weapons are in the 2.4k gold each range to make. Not surprising they made the armor in a similar range.
---
Still beautiful and people can still be proud/happy with it.
---
[Scallywag Chest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scallywag_Chest)
---
That's the business tit.
---
No boob should go it alone.
---
It was a fairly demanding fight compared to normal story stuff, that really punished casual players. It also varied greatly depending on what class you brought - I had an absolute nightmare trying to do it on ele, but it was much simpler on rev - which is something that shouldn't happen for solo PvE, where people should be able to play what they want.
---
This is sort of like asking for ketchup on your fries and getting a pack of tomato seeds.
---
So long as the quality exists highly within all game modes. My point is the more your attention and product is segmented the more difficult it is to maintain a high quality across all facets. 
---
I think their vision in the beginning was to bring to market an MMO that had all the fundamental elements but that also flipped the script (eg removing the holy trinity, getting away from kill X number of wolves, and bringing high quality story as the base instead of story being locked behind raids and dungeons). It’s ok to tweak, involve criticism from players, and evolve; but with raids, high lvl fractals, and the like, they seem to be straying from their vision to appeal to more players. It’s ok to have multiple modes of play, but there needs to be coherency without sacrificing original themes and mechanics. Basically adding raids wasn’t a bad idea, but developing them in such a way that holy trinity is used should not have happened. It makes the game feel schizophrenic. They should made raids unique to their style, while maintaining their true focus. That’s in essence what I was referring to.
---
They never claimed it was art. They said it was beautiful. They are APPRECIATING AND SHARING what the devs have done.
---
using the same boon and effect can easier see if this build buff or nerf
---
People can still be happy and show their joy for the game like this post. Thanks for taking that away from them!
---
yeah but its been a while to change the standard already, just like before we changed engi buff from condi benchmarks. it seems off to show highest possible dps with suboptimal buffset. what it tells ppl is "you could do this dmg but only if you run with druid and chrono, which you shouldn't"
---
&gt;Titles were 100% cosmetic. PvE skills were entirely unnecessary and pretty much tacked on for after the game was abandoned in the EotN era. 
---
Wut?
---
No dude. No. First, the game wad not abandoned when eotn was released, hence why so many people are runnning around with titles and such from thr HoM. Second, holy shit do you not remember how centralizing PvE skills and titles were in Nightfall and EotN? Ursanway? Save Yourselves and that other paragon shout singlehandedly giving paragons or paragon secondaries life in PvE? Like, c'mon, pve skills and title grind were the Big Deal for the last 2 or 3 years of GW1's life.
---
&gt; I shouldn't have to play the high level content that requires ascended gear in order to earn ascended gear - just hand over everything I need to play and let me play
---
You don't have to. Literally the only content that requires ascended gear is fractals, and you wont need armor until you're already earning it through drops and tokens.
---
I get that everyone has a different idea of how much vertical progression is necessary to hold their interest, but this is basically the lowest level possible to even count as progression and you're saying it's too much.
---
Well, too bad. It's an MMO, which means there needs to be compromises, because your preferences need to be balanced against tens of thousands of other people. You are not being denied access to any content because of a lack of ascended gear, so your complaint is really pretty selfish on the face of it. "This thing that other people enjoy and has been present in the franchise in some form since the beginning bothers me theoretically, so take it out of the game!"
---
Like, be angry if you want, not sure what you hope to accomplish with that.
---
Thank you! *ecstatic waving*
---
It’s either an oversight, or because most of mirage’s damage comes from confusion and torment which aren’t really shown well on the golem. Mirage is likely still the best condi class, especially on stuff like largos, it just isn’t shown on the golem
---
I tip nothing at all because I generally do the jumping puzzles on my own.
---
Metabattle recently archived the [Sustain Shiro Roamer](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Herald_-_Sustain_Shiro_Roamer) build. Is it really obsolete now, or can it still be used? Really wanted to try using it.
---
That is an issue for me as well. I don't care much for many of the rewards, skins, unlocks, titles nore the acquisition or gameplay to get them.
---
Because mirage's dps comes from confusion (using skills) and torment (moving). Golem does neither so the benchmark is next to useless. Instead in the mirage build they specify how many stacks of each condi you should aim for.
---
^^
---
That exactly. 
---
You are expected to tip because it is the social norm, because we all know the guy can't live on what they pay them alone.
---
You can spare the tip, he can't. Where i'm from, people would assume you are an ass if you don't tip.
---
Hahaha, Nice 1.
---
It can be EASILY interpreted as that. OP just wanted to share something pretty in the game. They do not deserve this hate on them for "disrespecting" the devs or their use of "made". English is an ambigious and hard language, the worst out there to learn for non-native speakers. Getting the dictionary terms out for hard interpretation here is **overkill**. I interpreted it the way the OP intended and took ZERO offense. 
---
I'm actually so pissed people are hating on this post to this degree. There is nothing wrong with this. No need for comment hate, just downvote and move on if you don't like it or don't believe it needs to be here. It has been upvoted because people DO ENJOY IT.
---
I also bet that every time a dev who worked on that scene sees it posted and appreciated and loved by the community ENJOYS/LOVES it. Or I'll eat a sock. Unless you also speak for all the devs at anet?
---
&gt; But I've definitely noticed high KP players to be a hell of a lot worse than they should be.
---
I was doing FOTM cms one night on off hours so I was expecting a long wait to fill the grp. The first player to join is a 3k ap thief and links up 100+ KP (lfg asked for 30 or 50 I forget) and I let the player know it seems suspect af that someone with only 3k ap is doing fractal cms regularly. My thought process is the game throws a fuck load of AP at you early on so getting up to 6k+ takes minimal effort. So we get to chatting a bit and they bring up the point about high AP players usually being shit (like high KP) sure enough a 32K+ AP player joins and they behave exactly like the 3k ap player said they would and they send me a PM saying as much and we shared a chuckle about it. 
---
I think part of it comes down to having either bought your way to success, being carried by your static that just took you along so when you pug it shows or for some players the blah attitude to doing the same fights hundreds of times and its ez to start slacking over time.
---
I won't put any specific spoilers, but the end of the most recent LS episode made me feel like the original plan was to start wrapping up GW2's story after that, maybe have an EotN-style expansion and/or LS season to bridge the gap into GW3. However, with the recent "restructuring" and increased scrutiny from NCSoft, I'm not sure if that's still the plan, or if there is a plan at the moment. They're probably still figuring all that out.
---
Couldn't watch the video, it's sped up(?) and the music is jarring.
---
Looks fun though.
---
&gt; I really should just get legendary aye...
---
Finally got to crafting my set recently. Maaan, is changing anything there a lot of clicking...
---
Taking some innocent poster who wanted to show a pretty moment that meant something to them in game. Yeah get him man, no survivors, we must have the purest and bestliest screenshots on this subreddit!
---
Probably not opening reddit discussions where they wreck their brain over how another player plays this game. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Like... why do you care enough to be appalled?
---
&gt; ...it's just to filter out the worst out there so the chances of having a smooth run will be that much higher.
---
This right here. Nothing is foolproof but it help for sure.
---
Hello!
---
How long will you guys at SC continue to update the website?
---
I'm not qualified for one of their jobs. Second best option!
---
wicked sick
---
Eh. Guildwars2 is definitely a game to play sparingly. I might hop on daily for a second or two but I won't really play except once or twice per month.
---
It's hard for ANet to pay bills that way, but IDK. It's kinda hard to reverse that shit.
---
Yes, a tiny speed up for fitting the song \^\^
---
And it was, thx!
---
Nah don't worry man, i'm more toxic than Britney Spears lol.
---
Plus i'm the HB and my friend is the alacren and my other friend is the bs, so if the Pug dps get frisky they get kicked lol
---
Holo doing 31k? Nerf it Anet!
---
Are you on EU? I could try to help you ingame if yes.
---
Depends, Rifle Deadeyes get up to 20k+ dps at pylons.
---
If you allready have Medium equipment just go with it.
---
As long as the PvP interface is there *for each legendary rune*, I don't see the problem.
---
I think they should just release something similar to ascended gear. That worked out great the first time
---
There's just nothing else worth chasing in this game. The games design means that the same set of ascended armor I stat swapped after pof is the same I'd use today, and if I really want to experiment i have heavy legendary. Outside of the occasional skin there's almost nothing to chase... And most of the best skins are gemstore or stupid grind that require map completion and i dont play MMO's to theme park.
---
There might be lots of "content" in gw2, but it's almost all shallow and easy.
---
That doesn't mean anything. You have to consider a few things:
---
- This survey probably cannot be done massively, specially if they are expecting answers with written text that would require to be analyzed manually.
---
- They cannot choose people based on very specific criteria like yours because it's very likely that if they do that they would receive similar responses that would not be representative of the community. Thats why they probably just divided people between different groups that met different criterias and then chose randomly X people from each group.
---
It took me forever to even remember what the Eater of Souls was.  All I did was basic  quick condi ranger and in the words of the great Michael Scott"boom roasted".  When I went to play PoF with a friend for their story I'll admit it downed spirit from me, but I realized thats because the indicator for him lungeing is that  that obvious.
---
Also happy cakeday friend
---
I was curious about this myself and only recently starting thinking, 'Should I be tipping the mesmer?'
---
As a new player, I don't have a lot of gold to just hand out. I always make sure I am polite and thank them for making achieving the Daily easier... but I might start tipping 50s or so if that's not considered insulting?
---
"Everyone lies" :)
---
You can play almost anything for roaming. Even necros can play with minions and still kill someone every once in a while.
---
 Chrono+druid imight be  completely dead for 5ppl,  but these are raid-oriented benchmarks, so why not. 
---
Bonus dps from AP can be easily calculated in most cases where it matters anyway.
---
*banned*
---
what exactly were you grinding for? O_o
---
It was a bit grindy for the currencies if you were making a legendary but nothing else comes to mind. I think some people complained about the exp for masteries but that wasn't really all that difficult ... unless you are one of those "must have everything NOOOOWWW" and then complain that there is nothing to do right after types.
---
Roaming build won't do you any good in large scale. You can however mix utility skills from old chrono builds with traits and gear from dps roaming one.
---
This is common knowledge, unfortunately.
---
Given that CC comes from skills, don't they already have tooltips that also dynamically change depending on traits?
---
To be fair, this could be considered off topic, right?  I'm not sure if "meta" posts constitute as off topic or not.  
---
Regardless, I'm not going to report this or anything, I was just giving my two cents on the topic.
---
Good News, It's great.

Further I don't face heavy framedrops in WVW anymore and EB runs very well with "high" character limit. It's rarely going less then 30FPS(Small scale/roaming). With Blobs it goes somewhat towards 27FPS, but no longer 9-12FPS headache.
---
Other games are also running a lot better now.
---
However, I'm still disappointed by AMD. 
---
Actually, I'm not able to play Destiny 2, Far Cry 5 New Dawn and Resident Evil 2 Remake and not able to use Win 10 Sandbox. 
---
Also a lot of people are facing heavy issues. Think twice before ordering. I felt like being completely fuc*** by Intel due to the Spectre/Meltdown Patches, which forced me to this upgrade, because the i7 3770k just died and lost a huge amount of power.
---
... with a lot of CC spam along with that
---
but it is also set up in a way where you can't lose
---
you can do it.

Mentor ≠ Commander

please no

Raid viability has a red X and not a green ✓
---
when you dive you gain momentum. When you dive+flap you get additional momentum. That momentum is lost over time while you are flying since it's consumed for speed, and is consumed greatly when you use it to rise.
---
Basically, if you rise all the way up to your starting point, you lose all the momentum gathered.
---
Apparently Warbringer (The WvW back item) can be crafted more than once but otherwise the existing ones are one per account only.
---
The official forums is Anets safe space. They only want praise or Neil Degrasse Tyson level critiques.
---
Heroic , really good work.
---
They just need something in each starting zone like what they did with the chests in the middle of a ring of death.
---
Add something like those Chak drones in TD that you can only kill if you CC.
---
Hell, just add ome to the 'training' heart in Queendale if they don't want to do every starting zone.
---
They really ramped it up this week, 2 people on my guild's discord got banned today for basically nothing.
---
I mean, you're the one who called the exploitative system a "meme" in the first place and linked the two. Also, the overwhelming sentiment in this thread is that tips are neither expected nor required in-game, so I'm not sure what you're on about when other people do what they want with their in-game money.
---
mmm join wvw.  its a sub culture of gw2 that may peak ur interest.  its not that hard but it requires team work that changes.
---
I only tip players who don't ask for tips that do challenging/huge timesaving skips, not stuff that can be cheesed. And often 1g or some other stuff.
---
sneak in and listen to the devs. tell us their secrets.
---
Focus is useful for that, mainly for the anti-projectile abilties and having an invuln doesn't hurt either.
---
&gt; glass thief
---
That actually makes part of the fight easier in a way. If you can take Caudecus down fast enough you avoid having to deal with jade and more CCs being thrown at you.
---
When exactly the fight was done also matters a bit. The initial release had a sniper like bandit which was later nerfed. I did not experience that version so I can't comment on that one.
---
But reading is hard
---
"People who like different things than me have underdeveloped taste"
---
you shoud stick around to confirm SNOW STORMS =)
---
Jade still spawns later into the fight if you aren't killing Caudecus quickly enough.
---
What is  this chart then. Is it just copied from another build? Left over from the previous rendition of condi weaver?
---
Ok, but it got me confused, maybe they should have put it in some default state. Grey out bosses, for example.
---
Hating on gw2 pops is more likely to reduce your chances of getting proper gw2 statues than suportimg them would.
---
so pretty soon
---
The way I ultimately ended up doing it was catching some horribly written tells that it's time to start doing things.  The instance doesn't do a good job of letting you know it's time to start shooting, and it doesn't do a good job of displaying Aurene's LoS during the two flyover sequences.  
---
In fact, I dare say that entire thing was as dumb as the Zhaitan fight because far too much of it was "on rails" AKA not interactive, and the interactive parts are just silly.  
---
With that said, the trick to finishing that AP is that the forward flyover starts at a somewhat unexpected time, before any dialog or other hints let you know... You just have to be alert to the moment you can begin clicking the targets and get going fast.  
---
Each target on him requires 3 shots to "break" though I'm not certain the health bar on them actually drops to zero unless you shoot 4 for some stupid reason.  
---
You'll have to run it a few times, but Aurene's flyby speed requires you to try and time your next target to still be in view for about 3-4 seconds to account for the cooldown on the skill from the previous target and then 3 shots on the next.  
---
LoS through Kralk's body is not an issue on these but range does seem to be, meaning a target too far away seems not to be hit though the shot will fire, and the timing requires you to target a little closer, work your way over and actually not bother shooting at some of the targets because you won't get that third shot in before it passes out of her LoS (Which isn't a good feeling mechanic either but w/e).  
---
All during this btw, you're missing the entire view of what's going on... You can actually look and see Kralk sucking in the magic on the horizontal flyover you're ignore this part (which the story mode allows) and just look around.  For want of just doing something, anything in this instance, there is detail that is easy to miss.  
---
IMO they put way too much of this on auto pilot, and kralk should have been moving around more, summoning more crystals and we should have had control over aurene's movement while we shot at kralk, only being interrupted to travel through the portal to the next gas cloud color that is a gigantic middle finger saying, "You're never getting this content now so stfu."  
---
Oh well.
---
Twice! Lol i hate you. I tried it for hours then i gave up and boycott it for weeks until its the last thing i need to do for Vision, then i bugged my sister to do it with me, took us 6-7 tries though. Ugh
---
Does everyone have access to a CC ability from the start though? Some weapons would have it I suppose, but utilities don't come along till later (except a heal).
---
Given the way the game unlocks ability's, it would be awkward no?
---
Anything not PMA towards the game is offtopic. Just remember this.
---
well, If you would donate something reasonable, it would be 1s probably. But then better don't tip. Maybe the service is worth more for you, but if there are many players doing the daily jp the service is not really worth that much. If you want a port to something rarer you got to pay more, but there is no jp in this game that would be worth porting for 1g. 
---
But if you use the portal at least say ty :)
---
Moderation on the forums is bizarre. They have no chill or a sense of humor.
---
Amusingly enough this is an option for certain liquids, although it wouldn't be pleasant coming out.  And again, I don't have a problem with it.  (I only play one class so paying $$ to outfit isn't a big deal)  
---
The catch is that GW2 is putting itself forward as a game focused around the experience, wheras the actual experience is to work (again, it's amusing) *in game* to purchase things you want.  It is, in it's purest sense the "second job" most MMO's try and avoid becoming and that makes it a *terrible* game.
---
Unless you sink money into it ofc, if you do the experience becomes pretty constantly good.
---
Again, if youre relying on combo fields, youre already running less than 100% uptime. Then, if youre relying on other people to self buff, then why are they even bringing a buff class? Its easy enough to bring a druid and get spirits on top of everything, if youre gonna bring tempest, you need to try really hard to bring 100% uptime on the core boons.
---
Additionally, if youre not going for safe 100% uptime, what are you getting in return? 2-3k DPS for going scepter instead of dagger? Maybe 5k to be super conservative (and probably unrealistic)? As a healer, that probably wont even equal 10k DPS total. Even if you drop to something like 80% uptime on boons, youre DPS will lose out on more than 5k DPS across the group/raid. So in the end, you might end up with better personal DPS, but youre more likely to run a net deficit DPS in the group/raid.
---
It's called having a broad perspective. Go play an asian MMO, any asian MMO or any traditional MMO for that matter. You will truly see what an actual grind is. GW2 grind is trivial compared to any of that, it's practically nothing.
---
Imagine having to grind xp for months to get 1 lvl higher on your char. Imagine grinding gold like crazy to enchant some gear and rng decides if you get the gear you want and if not just grind all over again. This is grind.
---
&gt; The intended purpose was for veterans to be able to indicate to new players their willingness to give help and advice.  
---
thats why.
---
Why would we comparing the HoT to an Asian MMO when the topic was about the step change in GW2. No one’s saying GW2 is grindy like other MMO, but that relative to what the previous 3 years had given us, it was.
---
It doesn't hurt to just leave it as it was pre-patch for now. Once it's updated the red X next to Raid Viability will turn into a green check mark, and that's enough of a visual indicator to know it's updated.
---
"Baam! Legendary runes and sigils"
---
I'm not bothered by it, if that's what you're getting at.  It's mildly interesting to me (in a 'huh' sort of way) that with the endgame being farming, GW2 has conformed itself into the "second job" so reviled by MMO purists.
---
What a surprise, devs don't want to communicate with the community in their free time, after communicating with the community gets two of them fired.
---
Who could have *possibly* predicted such a thing!
---
I agree. Guild Wars 2 is way too easy going when it comes to punishing you for playing bad or being careless. WoWs death penalty was pretty good. If youre being careless you have less stats if you decide to take the shortcut and not go back to your corpse. I dont remember if the current game is still like that...
---
But on the other hand you have Gw1 which, imo, was a bit too harsh. Two deaths and you may as well as quit and start the mission again which would suck so hard if you spent two hours and you die too much at the end boss.
---
fuck- i thought it looked cool but now that i read these comments and look back at my screenshot, it's got me thinking about a lot LMAO
---
News outlets decided a cartoon frog was racist, so trolls made it into Hitler frog, and now the frog is actually racist? Go outside.
---
Not to mention how clown pepe has been around for much longer than that sub.
---
When you need 12,000+ of each, yes. It is expensive in time or money.
---
Everything in guild wars save raids is very very easy. There's very little challenging repeatable content in this game and the rate at which its added is pathetic
---
You're saying this very old meme, Pepe the frog, is nazi, because some subreddit used it for some nazi shit?
---
Fuck off dude, all the info you need is there. I'm tired of this Nazi shit getting a pass because "duh it's just a cartoon frog".
---
If you can't see the connection, you're being intentionally obtuse.
---
thatsthejoke.tiff
---
... Nazi shit? Next thing you know, you'll assert that the universal sign for "ok" is an alt-right symbol for white power.
---
&gt; If you are communicating as a figure of the company then there is no acting like a jerk to your customers regardless of what is happening in your day to day end of story. 
---
Which is precisely why the correct move is to not to communicate with your customers in your free time.
---
&gt; If your move then is to not engage at all with your community because you are scared that you will snap at someone I really start to wonder what you think about us.
---
That it's made up of people, and ~5-10% of people, when given the power of both the internet, and anonymity, will act like shitlords. They will also tend to be the loudest voices, with the most time to piss away.
---
&gt;  Sounds like the anet devs have a pretty toxic out look if you ask me if you have to guard yourself so tightly from not being a shitty person.
---
What do you do for a living, if anything? Do you ever have to talk to customers?
---
so some right wingers made disgusting memes out of normal jokes and suddenly its "a nazi symbol".  
---
well okay then, whatever floats the boat of ppl.
---
No doubt about that, though.
---
Dude, there's no connection. Some random people on the internet grabbed a 10+ year old meme and used it for some nazi shit, and that's it. Doesn't mean the meme, Pepe the Frog, which again is over 10 years old, has any correlation with nazi shit.
---
It's like seeing a nazi wearing  Gucci clothes and saying "holy sheet i didn't know Gucci was a nazi brand".
---
It takes me 4 hours a day, ten hours a week to farm 5k of each. Im not saying you should do that, Im just saying its the guildwars grind. If you want anything in this game, you have to put in time or money. No amount of wailing on a reddit page they don't own or control is gonna make them lower the requirement.
---
Is the "ok" hand sign a symbol for white power? No.
---
Have many white supremacists USED it as a symbol for white power? Absolutely.
---
But that's not even what I'm talking about. Pepe in a clown wig is EXPLICITLY Nazi shit. They've been using memes about it to deny the Holocaust on multiple subreddits the past few months.
---
I'm not gonna walk you through all of it. You can either accept that it's a Nazi icon now or ignore the facts.
---
Looks like Bellevue to me.  See the clouds?  It rains 365 days a year here!
---
But there is no penalty for death in the story so it doesn't even matter how many times you die.
---
If it got to the point that whenever you saw a quaggan, it was linked to Nazis, then they would absolutely be a Nazi symbol.
---
That's the case with Pepe, especially in a clown wig. I don't know how I can elaborate more.
---
&gt; And they have every right not too. 
---
And they are now exercising it. I noticed that right after the JP incident, all the devs came out of the woodwork to do damage control, and assure the community that despite the incident, they will continue to actively communicate.
---
Then, a month later, that communication completely dropped off a cliff. Coincidence? I think not... But I'm only an outside observer, what do I know.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
&gt; doesnt mean that you don't do your job and communicate with your player base.
---
Sure, but if your job title does not include 'community relations', your job probably does not require you to do that.
---
&gt; Project management.
---
Then you've got to understand why interacting with customers (Which I'm sure you do, occasionally) is draining. I'd say it goes doubly so when those customers are random strangers with whom you have no rapport with.
---
Does context not matter? I understand that these people are using it alot but I dont agree that it makes every use of pepe or w/e immediately racist. Context matters imo.
---
I will tell my grandmother to select my traits and utilities and see if we get a more frustrating result. But I am convinced I could do it using only a ranger pet.
---
And why should it be impossible to list in lfg while helping new players? You can even list in lfg without any tag at all.
---
Pepe is touchy. It's been used a lot by the alt-right. It's not explicitly a Nazi icon.
---
Pepe in a clown wig is EXPLICITLY a Nazi icon, as I've said in many other comments.
---
Also, water is wet.
---
Weird too because someone posted a thread like this a while back...then mysteriously went quiet shortly after
---
its simple: stop being brainwashed by people, thats exactly what they want. yes, a image with said context is definitly something disgusting.   
---
a fucking frog with a clown wig which got created as a meme is def. not a nazi symbol.
---
You don't need a commi tag to list in lfg. You can literally list your squad there without any tag at all. So why should you be forbidden to do so while wearing an apple
---
Can confirm, and it's not like I was wasting anyone's time by faking kp back when I cared to do fotm anyways. I would never try to sneak my way into groups in any game if I felt like I would be the weakest link. I think it took me a total of like 5 runs before I was adequate for pretty much any kp requirement groups in terms of comfort with everything and capability of min-maxing my damage output as best as possible.
---
nobody needs a commander tag to list a squad in lfg
---
You seem to be misunderstanding the issue here my dude. I'm not talking about random devs talking to the community. I'm talking about the lack of official communication from devs who's job it is to talk to us. There has been little to no official communication from the devs for months and months and that is causing unrest in the community at large as can be seen by all the top posts these couple of days.
---
Thanks, but you're being too modest!  I simply used the same template you provided and swapped out the details.  
---
Clearly I'm not as smart as you, as I'm unable to make such "cause and effect" claims on my own.  
---
I appreciate the help and I will make sure to PM you if I require assistance in the future.
---
Still looks like vampyric warlord to me.
---
It doesn't matter how ridiculous it sounds. You can dumb it down to "it's just a clown frog meme" but that doesn't mean much when the meme says "hello frens, just putting 6 million cookies into the oven".
---
Do you think they picked a silly meme by accident? They want their memes to seem innocent. By pretending they're not problematic and hurtful, we're just letting their views spread into society.
---
pretty sure you can make 5 man groups with the apple tag up.
---
The new ECSU Holo build looks kinda cancer to play compared to the pre patch PBM build. You still get less DPS than PBM got pre-patch while constantly getting within an inch of overheating before disengaging Photon Forge. Such a big risk for such a mediocre reward. I miss the old PBM rifle build so bad. :C
---
Lol yeah, I of course tested it a few times in whisper to a friend numerous times to determine what the safest delays would be in order to guarantee consistency.
---
Yep, you followed my template exactly. No leaps of logic at all.
---
&gt; I can absolutely see where someone just wanting to run the story and not interested in stepping up the gameplay is not going to be happy about that mess, and similar ones that happen later (I bet that guy the OP ran into would quit the game after the Bullet Hell boss from LS4 e2).
---
And the more Arenanet caters to this, the less interested in this game I become.
---
HoT was too hard for casuals because the core game didn't prepare them for it. It was like going from 6th grade to 12th grade and skipping the intervening years. I did dungeons and fractals, so I was more ready but many people didn't. They expected the open world to be piss easy, particularly since Orr had been nerfed because people couldn't handle it.
---
You completely missed his/her point. Someone that loves the story in gw2, is dedicated to it, will know every little detail about it, and will spend hours researching or theorizing little tidbits they find. WP as a prominent example. 
---
On the other hand, someone that plays the story and openworld because its a shiny looking game and best suited to just login, semi idle and still have the feeling of accomplishment that mmos offer (and thats btw highly addictive, just putting it out there), wont want any difficulty increase or to spend hours trying to solve a lore-puzzle.
---
While the wording was a bit biased, the point is true. A big part of the gw2 playerbase views this game as barely a step up from idle games. And they feel vindicated because anet said: no grind, no gear progression, just jump in. And because anet lived up to that ever since LS3.
---
Another, currently leaving part of the playerbase remembers the old GW2, up until HoT nerfs, that focused on challenging gameplay instead of auto-playing story instances.
---
Its not about favoring raids over story or openworld events over pvp. Its about the dedication and - yes - work someone wants to put into GW2. How invested someone is. Is it just a game to play on the side, to log in to get that rush of "rewards!", chat with guild and log out again? Or does someone spend hours theorycrafting builds, testing on golem, researching lore, replaying story instances in case they missed something or want to proof a theory.
---
Anet went from supporting one extreme to the other extreme. Theres barely any middleground. Hence why one side of the playerbase is always angry and leaving.
---
its called context. you know...you put words or other images / changes to it to give it a meaning.  
---
if 60k people use something to create something disgusting and another 900k doesn't but also uses it too in normal ways, its simply not a symbol for a single group...opposed to official symbols which got used by fashist groups all over the world.  
---
one example would be the celtic cross. in germany for example all symbols from nazi germany are forbidden.  
---
also new symbols like the celtic cross, but only if there are more informations to it which gives it the characteristica of a nazi symbol.  
---
so if you are running arround on some medival festival with a celtic cross on your flag, and the flag is for example not black white red and one can see it has nothing to do with it, its fine and no one can piss you on for it.  
---
and tbh. here its the same. CONTEXT MATTERS. a single fucking clown is NOT a nazi symbol, even if they try to fuck it up and take away the fun people have.
---
I can't explain to you why using this particular symbol is horrible, so I'm just going to leave you be.
---
I held out hope after the Toxic Nightmare and Shattered Observatory CMs that this was to be the trend in the future (and Anet would start to put more challenging 5-man content in). 
---
Dwarf fractal... No CM
---
Pirates fractal... No CM
---
Hard to stay engaged in the game when the content releases are 4 month intervals of 3 hrs of story content primarily. Raids are cool but it requires 10 people and it's only rewardable once a week. 
---
Nah, Anet only cares about the casuals now.
---
So uhh, could you take your nazi shit somewhere else plz
---
You didn't read what I wrote. I said that Siren's Reef and Deepstone is difficult in the way of being deathly punishing. 1 mistake during those boss fights and you're pushed into the water to your death or stuck in the tornado of doom (that is so clunky it often will suck up people who try to save you) and you're done. If someone were to screw up during a CM, it never results in instant death. If you fall off the platform during Arkk, the game gives you a whole extra fuck up before it punishes you, if someone doesn't stand in the circle when they're doomed to explode, everyone takes damage that can be easily be rehealed. The only mechanic that punishes you with instant death is not killing the spawns during the 2nd boss of CM99. Outside of that, it is much easier to wipe in the more recent fractals than the two CMs. Both Arabella's wind and the elemental are extremely deadly since if you don't get out of the AoE **immediately**, you are dead. It will even grab you through blocks and stability. There's so much graphical noise in this game, that I have to constantly stare at the floor during the entire elemental fight, especially since I play a lot of greatsword warrior which, just like staff elementalist, forces you to stand still to do a large portion of your damage.
---
It’s better but the red eyes are still sort of weird :/
---
They update the site piece by piece.
---
They usually start with benchmarks. The members of SC all theorycraft, then test what would be best. Once they see what all classes are capable of on the golem, they then use them in actual content to see what comps are best.
---
Since most changes generally don't severely alter a classes viability, it makes no sense to change everything every single patch, to go back and set it right back where it was. The build viability chart is still mostly accurate, and is only actually accurate when you are using their compositions.
---
If your build was rated "meta" last patch, chances are it's still a really good pick this patch. If it was rated good, it's still probably going to be rated good. The only exception is when drastic changes happen to a class, and it goes from shitting out tons of damage to being super nerfed. The build viability chart is still good enough to figure out what works well on fights, even if it's not updated yet.
---
What we really need is an NPC (like the dodge roll one with the chest as a reward) in early zones that clearly tells you to use hard/soft CCs to break the bar. It's literally that easy. Make the NPC list all types of CC and to "check your skill description if it has one of the CCs then attack"... new players aren't idiots, they'll learn if there was a proper tutorial in place.
---
This comment reads like one from early Reddit, or imgur itself
---
That's vague.... ಠ_ಠ
---
you can only use the mentor tag while you are in a party or solo. If you use the LFG you automatically create a 10 man squad(there are some exeptions) without a commander. then you loose the mentor tag.
---
Sure why not, if you can drink bath water you can also drink black tar.
---
Bring the devs cupcakes, anet devs are sickers for cupcakes
---
I love how much the pve raid community whines even tho they get way more content than pvp+wvw combined. 
---
Bring on the hate.
---
Me as well... I want more sexy furrys!
