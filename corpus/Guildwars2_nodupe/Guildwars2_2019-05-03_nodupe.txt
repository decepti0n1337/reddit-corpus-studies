Fantastic as usual :D

---
I have no idea what is being run in fractals now (I mainly raid), but have you ever thought of switching from DPS to support role?
---

---
Healer might suit you well. There usually isn't a fixed rotation and you have plenty of heals yourself, so good survivability there. 
---
In raids people usually run either druids or healing Firebrands. Fractals should be more or less the same. 
---
I've done my share of healing (both fractals and raids) and boi would I recommend it. It's bit more laidback and you will see more of the fight. You will be more aware of what is happening and you might start enjoying the fights even more.
---
When I started with druid, that was something eye-opening. That's when I really fallen in love with raids as I started understanding everything more, started seeing things in the bigger picture.
---
I eventually switched back to dps, but because I had the understanding it was much easier and I was better than I could have been without trying out the supportive role. 
---
I highly recommend you giving it a try. :)
---
The 2k mount skins are all new models. The warclaw skins are all the same.
---
It's not. But it still requires decisions from players and understanding of different layouts. The easiest solution is to make it so when you equip a weapon,. the skills are just there.  The more you raise the bar, the more people fall beneath it.  It may seem ridiculous to you, but Anet took out interactable food in early levels of Queensdale, to make the game easier for some people.
---
In current Tier 2 matchup this week, TC is up against FC and YB.
---
FC is made up of a large number of bandwagon fight guilds which i bet many servers in NA will struggle against.
---
YB on other hand is just meh. While TC would come and fight FC....YB is more interested in running away and doing PPT.
---
I think you might be best picking a linked server and bandwagon to whoever is linked with Blackgate so you can have twice the number of people than your opponents and kill them easily and feel proud of your achievement :)
---
Hey Im getting this error https://imgur.com/u0moxuj

&gt; Let's say for the sake of argument that in gw2 there are only 3 skills to choose from and in gw1 50. At some point you find what works best in both games, but which system is more fun to you, the one where you only have 3 to choose from?
---
The thing is that in GW2 you have **more** skills/traits to choose than in GW1. Even with all the restrictions you can choose more skills/traits than you could in GW1 from a bigger pool of skills/traits than you had in GW1. 
---
The number of skills/traits you can choose is bigger and the total number of skills/traits are bigger than we had in GW1. So your argument is invalid.
---
Incredible skill man.
---
GW2 needs more interiors, more emotes, more clutter items, more player toys and more real windows.
---
Agree 100% with above posters.  I hardly play anymore because of the issues, and it's hard to take it seriously when I do.  The balance is shit, the PvP core design is overly cluttered (runes, sigils, traits) and simultaneously neglected--a terrible mix.
---
Who is "we"?...
---
**I** really like that skills are fixed to weapons and so on. 
---
I **do** want this.
---
The funny thing about Reapers is that they are the most common build I see when I pug a fractal (Tiers 1 – 3).  Heck I was in a Fractal group last night where 3 of the 5 players were Reapers.  
---
It’s sort of gotten to the point where if I pug a fractal and the group doesn’t have a Reaper, I feel like there is something missing lol.
---
Congrats, I just saw that you and Ramona were featured in this article about [immortalizing pets in videogames](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/05/02/the-pets-immortalised-in-videogames-by-their-developer-owners/).
---
Thanks again for all the wonderful things you've contributed to GW2!
---
DH is actually hit rather hard by screwing up your rotation because it uses most of its utility &amp; F skills for aid/utility of the group.
---
Have you tried alacrity renegade? You press f4 off cd and spam autoattack otherwise.
---
In kalla you pretty much only press your elite.
---
In mallyx you rip boons if neccessary.
---
In shiro you press impossible odds.
---
In jalis you give stability.
---
Your sword 2 and 4 are a personal dps increase but even if you don't use it, you will be very effective.
---
You swap to staff if you need cc. Renegade does have other utility such as might from f2. Use it when you drop might. Kalla has a decent daze albeit the breakbar damage is quite slow. All other utility skills are either not worth using or so niche that you will only be using them once in like 2 weeks.
---
The major difficulty of playing this class is having enough energy left to press f4 off cd which only takes some experience to get used to.
---
60 Mbps down
---
Its meta on DH &amp; FB.
---
Just be aware that if you PvP with it the damn auto attacks move so slow that anyone beyond 400 range can outrun the orbs or simply strafe side to side to avoid them.
---
I use /say, but it makes me feel like the crazy man on the street talking to aliens.  I would love to be able to at minimum /w myself, but I really like the idea of a notepad where I could save stuff like a checklist
---
Everyone else is pretty right when they say to level your first one, but if you've got Path of Fire, it doesn't hurt to create an alt and complete the first and second story instances of that expansion to get the raptor mount, which is a nice quality-of-life upgrade.
---
just to confirm. you saw it say 1 file copied? From the latest version 0.9.9 yeah?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Even if so i would still say do a clean install (delete d912pxy folder and bin 64, re run launcher to generate bin 64 then redo d912pxy) one more time to be sure. if it really doesn't work then, sorry I'm out of ideas... :T
---
Wow awesome thank you for this.
---
Thanks your right on the money, actually changing them now ;)
---
Just did a clean install, same issue. I did see the 1 file copied confirmation. :(
---
On one hand, out of three good fractal dps specs weaver is the easiest one to recover, especially if you play FA. The whole rotation is literally 15 seconds long and you can reset it at any time.
---
But. Buut dh allows you to ignore stuff altogether, with it's f3, focus blocks and uber heal. So you are likely won't even need to step away and use a heal.
---
thank you! I always thought the underboob was sorta ridiculous personally though!
---
next version will be underboob only. no ETA on that though :p
---
thanks! i think!
---
Tbh daredevil isn't very good in fractals either. It has poor burst and foced movements on dodge and staff skills don't help too. Still better than scourge, but.
---
nailed it.
---
no scarf though, it comes with t3 hooman cultural armor
---
lol sht, i actually made the one on the back, just didnt render for some reason, feelsbadman. the one under the boob was too awkward so i got rid of it.
---
Or maybe you just used dps skills while randomly pressing everything off cd. I've seen ele mains who play it for years and still have no clue how the class works.
---
Can you explained this to me? I don't get it.

Don't look for servers, look for commanders.
---
It seems some of it does. If the achievement is available to be completed, that tiny yellow mark should appear above your skills.
---
Shortbow/Dagger Torch Soulbeast is more damage overall now, only with the negatives of being melee range (Which you already kind of are for the trap on Shortbow/Shortbow) and requiring enemies to stay in the Fire Field of Bonfire. And the Lynx Build can swap to Shortbow/Shortbow easily for when the movement becomes relevant.
---
Wheres her clothes?
---
Hilarious.

I have leftover PoF codes, if you'd like them!
---
Just bought! Crap. Um can you dm me one for a friend?
---
Alliance rework doesn't involve a new map or reworking EOTM at all (as per the Anet info to date). They are still working on the new systems as per some feedback I've recently seen.
---
&gt; Holiday mount skins packs - Spooky, Mad Realm, Wintersday - were always sold as bundles and never individually, and also for 2k gems (regular price) per bundle, despite some players asking for an option to just buy 1 skin instead of the whole thing.
---
Yeah, but that was 1 skin for each mount. This is multiple skins for one mount. It's a different situation. 
---
I'm fine with the first option, but not the second, since I can only use one skin at a time.
---
I love holosmith.  Personally I usually run off meta and go kit-less sword/shield, but I also don't plan on ever being an exceptionally good player, just decent is good enough for me, do cms etc.  The burst is very easy to pull off, and unlike dh or daredevil, its burst isn't really built on conditional modifiers (dh's f1 and daredevil's signet), so if you screw up timings and realize you need to have started preparing your burst 5 seconds ago, your still pretty good.  As such, holo's burst is very flexible, at least the kitless version I play is.  If the boss's cc bar is broken, and your over 50% heat, just hit your laser disk.  I.e. when you use your laser disk can be moved around in your rotation with relatively little punishment.  You can use it in holo forge or outside of it, and it won't make too much of a difference.  The important thing is using your disk while the cc bar is broken and that your over 50% heat.
---
Make sure you have that latest windows 10 update as well.
---
Mentioning gender is irrelevant, we have about 20% female commanders of different abilities in our guild, but our best commander that only raids about twice a week is a woman.
---
Our commanders use a mix of characters genders that is not always their same, same as players.
---
That commander might be using the claim for supply or not know the use of claim.
---
We recently had our garrison taken back by a commander doing a family raid who had no clue of the use of claim, and this was a guild really pulling their weight in spite of guild size.
---
The real answer is play whatever but very badly and join parties with eles who need conjures and then die all over their conjures so they can't pick them up and therefore lose DPS. Everyone's DPS tanks with you! YOU become the punisher, ha!
---
Jokes aside though probably daredevil if you want to be brainless, but I think scourge or dh are also good options while being a bit more fun (imo, anyway). Scourge + dh do have things you need to watch out for if you really want to hit good numbers, though. I also think power soulbeast is very simple but I guess there's the potential to time your Sic 'ems badly. Really all this just depends on what you prefer, once you get experience you'll know how/when to dodge and time your rotation.
---
only posting sells, but buying has no fee, so basically the TP is a bank that keeps me accountable to my goals.
---
Oh, no doubt. The ceiling on the Soulbeast build using Dagger Torch is higher than the one using only Shortbow. On the other hand, the Shortbow only build is easier to pick up, and if you drop the trap for something else, you can still be effective at range. It isn’t optimal, but if we’re talking optimal, then I wouldn’t go for Condi Soulbeast. I think it does good enough damage at a low skill level requirement, and so it’s a nice starting point.
---
That very same infusion, 6 of them. Seems LOOONG ways ahead, but gotta start somewhere I guess.
---
In most games, I think.  I'll get down-voted but i think a lot of it are guys who think the pixelated character is hot, or women that wish they looked like t heir pixelated characters.

hey, you took my advice about posting it here :D
---
&gt; watching boss animations
---
Bosses have animations?
---
Unless ANet reduces visual clutter by 99% I will take dancing around orange aoe indicators every time over squinting my eyes to see boss animations under all the effects.
---
Seems like a lot of time investment for an average \~8g return per map
---
cool, might have to try this as well then.    
---
Awful with the impulse buys.
---
Mileage will vary.  I feel like I got pretty decently lucky.
---
Ultimately my message is about not giving into this design that ANet forced upon the population.  I just wished that more people felt the same way.
---
dang, you just had to go and put the ****good**** eye brows.
---
Where did they say that the event was canceled?  From what I understood, they couldn't remove the daily cap for this upcoming event but they will plan to do so for future runs of this upcoming event.
---
I think your are misintrepeting my meaning of subtle. What I am saying is that it's not a big blob of shining bright lights that totally kill any and all detail. It doesn't have a massive draw effect, the aura doesn't obscure the entire body. It's lovely. Sure there are many colors in it, and it looks kind of rainbowy, but in the dominator way, not the Dreamer way.
---
I sure did!!!!

i learned this the other day too i should get started with it

Yup exactly this. Check up on Dulfy website too, they tell you in the prerequisites if you need to complete the story first, which is most of the aches for HoT story, including the no revive one.
---
yea well i kinda need another carrot on a stick to keep me playing so this is one of em
---
Before SC updates their benchmarks, guides, and videos, a great source is the Snowcrows Helpdesk discord. It's a good place to ask questions and lots of people post their personal benchmarks and buildcraft theories there.
---
Here's the link: https://discord.gg/qTs63YH
---
and more supply yes.
---
If you had exotic equipment when you left, it’s still totally adequate. That’s the beautiful part of not having a gear treadmill. I can back after a three year break, and was able to hop right into HoT (quit playing after Season 2).
---
I think this short bob hair looks a lot better with this armor. She really looks more like an assassin with the shorter hair.
---
You can definitely whisper yourself. I do it all the time
---
Thank you for your honesty
---
I actually like this version of the chest armor more than the underboob version.
---
I don't believe that I had any exotics.
---
Ignore the other guy, GET BACK INTO THIS GAME NOWWWWW. ITSS FREEE(without the expacs).
---
Raids arnt anywhere near required for enjoyment. It wont be too hard to get some decent armor, and if ya got a couple gold you should be fine.
---
The xpacs are great for story and content. Glider from HoTs, mounts from PoF. Great elite specs for the classes with the xpacs which changes up the class quite a bit. But even without the xpac the same game (plus a bit more) from when you first played is still there and ready to be experienced again so its totally worth
---
[removed]
---
Not entirely sure what ur tryna say. Hes bidding on auri because he wants it, not to flip it - and theyre worth 2.5-3k on tp: I personally list them at 2.8-2.9 and they sell fast. Theres litterally no way he can lose any amount of gold if he picks it up for even 300g.
---
darn, I was holding out hope that they would just revert Life Sheath back to what it used to be T.T
---
When I get home in a little bit, I'll give you some builds to try out :)
---
I'll edit my post.
---
thank you!
---
I say go for it. Fun game. Wvw. Conquest. Fractal. All fun things you can hop into if you are level 80.
---
thanks! i think the fact that the chest piece has a little scarf thing demands short hair, seems aesthetically (spelling?) appropiate
---
yes, you are the only one, now stop it before everyone else notices O.o
---
Yep, great time to get back into the game. But it also depends on what you're looking for. It's not really a "standard" MMO. There are probably better games if you're only interested in raiding. There are probably not many better games if your main interest is the open world. Most games don't have anything like WvW.  
---
But if you like the game, then it's a good time to jump back in.
---
Hi I hate to break it to you but Scraper is not currently meta outside of PvP. As an Engineer like yourself, have you considered smithing? Specifically Holosmithing? HMU if you have questions.
---
Well you’re in luck, a full set of berserker’s exotics can be had for 20-30 gold from the trading post! You can buy 1-2 items a day with the 2 gold from doing Dailies.
---
Absolutely beautiful!!
---
If you are worried about gear, it is fairly easy to get decent gear starting from nothing. A full set of rare (yellow) gear can be had for a few gold (2 gold is the reward from completing daily achievements, maybe half an hour's work at most). After a month of fairly casual play, you can have a full set of exotic (orange) armour, which is sufficient for most content, and is around 90% strength compared to the best gear you can get. I started as a new player around a year and a half ago with both xpacs (GW2 was my first MMORPG too). There was a lot to take in, but it wasn't overwhelming.
---
The short version is that gear treadmill and power creep aren't big things in GW2, most things are sidegrades once you get to level 80.
---
What if it's both?
---
What do people do with excess gold? Convert to gems and play fashion wars?
---
Basically you can store gold on the TP by placing buy orders on crazy expensive items that nobody in their right mind would want to sell to you at that price.
---
Example: 3k gold expensive infusion that's always hovered around that price since it's introduction, place a buy price of 100g and do it on other ones or similarly priced items... legendaries, infusions etc.
---
That way you could have 5k gold for example, stored in the TP and it costs you nothing. Some players do this to stop themselves from impulse spending? Idk but looks like OP wants to avoid spending money so they'd rather not see it in the wallet and just store it on the TP.
---
Depends on where you live, it also is how night works in areas like these where it is more enclosed.
---
Fresh air weaver is OK in pvp. It plays like thief but not as high damage. You can have near perma superspeed and pretty much bennyhill the entire match instead of shadowstepping around. 
---
It's poor man thief
---
It's a marketing tactic to get them all for a "cheaper" bundle price. Idk if they'll ever let you purchase one that you want, specifically.
---
Something tells me they're gonna release a 2k gem warclaw skin soon...
---
Pmuch how guys play with dolls
---
That is a false equivalence of not finding the content fun with not wanting more challenge. Also the whole point that people have been making is that the mechanics don't feel fun because they just arbitrarily made a boon not function there with its intended purpose along with the inability to melee certain groups of adds that are just far enough out of range to pull, and are still able to nuke you from afar. That is just stupid and the whole encounter was designed to annoy. There is also no challenge in relying on a healer to save you vs relying on yourself to maintain your own health. A healer itself has a difficult job in that situation, but in reality what happens is all of that responsibility is diverted to one person instead of dispersed evenly so in effect it makes everything less challenging for everyone else.
---
Ok
---
So far I've been just doing map completion and personal stories. Just out of curiosity, what maps are the most popular and what do people do there?
---
Oh hell yeah the light and medium sets look great there, I dont particularly care for the heavy but it's still much nicer than most other options ingame.
---
Goddamn too many questions all over the place. Please organize your thoughts.
---
&lt;LEGENDARY CRAFTING&gt;
---
- need legendary crafting mastery to 3 for gen 1 legendary weapons
---
- need mastery 4 for gen 2 legendary weappns
---
- only need crafting levels high enough for the components, gift of wood/metal/darkness etc is level 400, same goes with t7 mats. Legendary inscription would be 450. Each recipe can be unlocked on weaponsmith, artificing, huntsman etc.
---
- gen 1 needs gift of explo but gen 2 can be maguuma or desert maps
---
&lt;LOOT FOR GOLD&gt;
---
- My bag opener is level 53, it keeps changing but difference is minor. You farm green bags and salvage what you get from them for mats.
---
- refine the mats and sell
---
- I honestly like to sell my unid bags at the highest bidder (less risk). You may do the extensive research to find the most ideal way to penny pinch but for me it's negligible difference.
---
idk, most of the armor sets are actually pretty "good" in regards to not being oversexualized. this one just happens to be an exception, probably because it was one of the fanciest sets at launch
---
Try install to game root folder, not bin64 (read promts or copy it from bin64 by hand) and check VC redist installed [https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc\_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
---
thanks for proving my point, donald
---
Well there's a lot of new stuff added even to the base game, but if you don't want to go do map completion or buy the expansions try doing some fractals, it's really fun if you're in a party with people! Ask someone in Lion's Arch or something if they want to do it with you or you can LFG but it's better to have a group from the start so they don't rush ahead.
---
There are no rotations.  Use Viper Gear, spec Curses + Soul Reaping, keep at least 2 Sand Shades on the ground at all times, use Epidemic on cooldown, and spam all other skills that apply Conditions or grant Barrier.  Voila.
---
After watching Asmongold interact with Dark Souls/Sekiro... Yeah nah, I don't think he's cut out for gaming.
---
The more I read about GW1 here, the more I wish I would have played it back in the day.
---
Try moving the game somewhere else, out of Program Files (and other Windows' own folders). IIRC I had the same issue, and that solved it.
---
The max level boost is a consumable item that you can use. You don't have to use it if you don't want to.
---
Each expansion comes with a max level boost for free so you're not really "paying" for it. You can just not use it or use it on an already max level character to get the bonuses and free up the shared inventory slot. If you want the full game experience then you should get both expansions. Check the gw2 website for official retailers and check the prices since retailers usually have lower prices compared to the official website without a sale. Don't buy from sites that are not on the list because they might cause some issues in the future. I heard DLgamer offers expansions at discounted prices and is on the official list.
---
You always get the 1 max level boosts and the the account slot per expansion, no getting around that (it's also free stuff). If you really don't want them (I would suggest saving them till later anyways) then you can always just get rid of them. 
---
As for what to get I'd suggest getting both, I can go into detail but they both add a ton of content (though almost entirely end game after level 80 stuff). Each expansion is normally $30 and the official pack discounts both together to $50. The game goes on sale every so often for 50% off making the pack as low as $25 If you don't want to wait there are other official retailers that have constant sales like [DLGamer's $38 pack](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911). Only buy the game from [official retailers](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#UnitedStates-digital).
---
Its hard choosing your own goals, and not having them force fed to you eyyyy
---
GW3 only on Casio digital watch next winter!
---
The core game, hot and pof content each bring something to the table for gameplay and they each can stand alone or together for the mmo immersion.  If you are hesitant to buy expansions, play the core game for free to check it out first.  Keep in mind that expansions, along with their living story content, has evolved with aggressive pace as the game matured. Story immersion, casual to skilled gameplay, managing/cooperating with groups and redefining your personal objectives will be challenged every step of the way depending on how serious you get.  I personally think they are worth the buy.
---
I dont have karma or magic to buy obsidian shards so Im glad for any wich I can get for "free". Just dont know if your heads up an hour before reset and in middle of the night when I was sleeping already... if it helped =/
---
Yeah sorry, I posted it as soon as I discovered it, but wasn’t much time before the reset. Hopefully it’s at least a useful reminder that this little device cranks out a regular supply of Obsidian, from a minimum of 3 to a max of 30, worth checking every day.
---
The dailies in your achievement tab (for all game content) concentrates the player population for those specific maps and events.  This changes everyday, which causes the game to go on a rhythmic cycle.  For the higher group content and map activity, I recommend using * /wiki event timer * to find groups organizing to run a meta event.
---
Would gold sellers buy DLC to sell gold though? I can't imagine that having a good return rate.
---
And doesn't this move sort of just delay the inevitable?
---
&gt; So why does it hurt to have more again?
---
because it is harder to balance. The whole point why we have the system as we have it right now is because the devs didn't want to deal with all of those skills. And just because they never be able to get them all balanced doesn't mean they need to look at how the system works and if this system is not maintainable or produces the same issues every time and they have to be Sisyphos then it is time to change the system and make it more maintainable.
---
As I said already, GW2 isn't perfect either but it is a lot more maintainable than GW1 was with all those skill combinations.
---
Your path of exile example is also not really applicable here because those are two totally different games with two very different foci.
---
&gt; in PvE I don't give a crap, can't buy a cookie with balance, I'm not looking for balance, I want to create unique builds.
---
Yes you do! because if you have a crap balance then all of your "unique builds" don't really matter. What sense does it make to have 100 different and unique builds if no one actually wants you in your group in Raids, Fractals or even dungeons because you are under-performing?
---
That is the whole point, You want a system that is easier to maintain but also gives you variety which we actually have. With more skills it gets exponentially harder to maintain but, as for GW1s system, doesn't necessarily mean you will be able to use every single skill at a time since you could only select from two different professions.
---
You should just find something good to invest in.
---
Thank God I play alot of wvw and had 20k tomes
---
You can't send gold with f2p account so they would have to.
---
The waiting period is there to prevent chargebacks/refunds.
---
The original mount pack will get a select license the moment ANet feels like they need to squeeze some extra money from the players. I'm waiting for that, since f*k buying random, but I'd like that Starbound griffon skin.

---
I haven't seen core BS getting a mention here, but in that rotation you don't even swap weapons usually (only for CC) and the main idea is using axe 5 after a physical skill, and holding off the cooldown of other skills if you can use a physical skill soon. 
---
You can then take your build and laugh at dps who are below you while unironically using a rotation without weaponswap and consists mashing buttons after physical basically.
---
cry me a river of souls
---
also her shoulders are all kinds of funky
---
I didn't have the money to impulse buy them the minute they drop and by the time I had the money I didn't particularly want to buy all the skins lol. 
---
I'd like the option to buy one, I'd take a blind bag scenario too. I don't see it happening though. I just hope more Warclaw skins are in future license bundles. Was disappointed to see no new ones in the latest one.
---
This is so cool! What program did you use to create her? :D
---
So good! Thank you!
---
Thanks for clearing it up for me fellas
---
Still annoyed I have to wait for 4 days but no big deal
---
Wow, looks great!
---
I don't see any depth blur on OP's screenshots to be honest...
---
No its alright. It takes a while to get. Wind and Wine were the last ones for me as well. Killing Awakened and those Jacaranda. My sweetheart got it from River Drake all the way on the other side of the map. I also thought it was buged but sadly it isnt.
---
Yea he obv wont get it at that price unless theres some idiot... But to say hes gonna lose gold would also be incorrect as theres no bidding fee and he can get that good back any time he wants, auris themselves have always been 2k+ in the 3years theyve been available. so yea imo hes not losing anything - hes just hoping for a 0.000001% chance some1 is stupid enough to insta it :p

(I mean i get my auris 1k less than theyre actual value so there maybe a time when he can get it for 300 and resell for 700g = profit still)
---
I see blender, i give a like.
---
Did that do it?
---
buy pof expansion for mounts
---
First .. you just sold yourself that you have access to multiple accounts. Also I cant .. I cant make any fat jokes on this. You are setting it up to much. I cant say that she has her own gravity. [I cant say that you should throw something next to her and see if they will orbit around her.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZB-AdZwz84)
---
It happens. I got a Light of Dwayna recipe for 5g years ago, the price went back to 200+ within months of that.
---
more like balthazar
---
Interesting and very frustrating for players who missed living world season 1.
---
Good bot
---
Power Reaper Minions have poor dps but amazing utility. They add toughness per minion, and every 10s each minion takes a condition off you and transfers it to its target, making the Reaper impervious to conditions and very tacky. When they die they create poison fields all over the place that you can do finishers in. In AoE pulls when you use Rise you can get 10+ minions up, multiplying those effects further. 
---
Minions in that build are already close to OP, giving them significant DPS too would definitely be OP.
---
I have been playing only Elementalist since release. I want to try something new, please help me what should I try. I have both expansions so I can play any specs.
---
I would like to be useful in fractals, and at least a bit more tanky than Elementalist. I don't mind being a melee if I can survive more than an Elementalist.
---
If the guild has the permission set anyone can launch missions. To get solo credit you can get any single spot on treks, the single bounty missions are easy (can even just ask in map chat), and the races can be done solo as well though the credit on races is a little buggy...
---
It's hardly new. I get this bug everytime I raid on mirage and it's the most annoying shit that was never fixed since PoF released.
---
Think they should change the AP cap for daily ? Insted of 15k move it up for 20k ? Veteran hunters doesnt do daily anymore. They have gold and no AP will be gained so whats the point ?
---
OP ist talking about achievment per living story. So I assume the AP from the core game are not in the calculation
---
Ok is there any other fast paced classes you could suggest maybe also if it's a flashy class it's a good bonus
---
Yeah I know. Also depend if you are in US or EU. Lets just say that I was banned myself many times before because of this and yet Im still playing just fine.
---
So now that they can milk wvwers for money too, updates to the most neglected gamemode when? =)
---
God damnit. When anet says they will release alliances. They will release them! There's no need to remind them every year.
---
The TD story mission from HoT also has a guaranteed key.
---
Opening up without a broken bar is a huge loss too. Those modifiers stack multiplicatively with breakbar bonus I think.
---
Ah it isn’t ripped from the 3D gw modell?
---
You can literally see the "Release" part on the graph. .-.
---
did you accidentally press some other skills apart from 1?  
---
all mobs die very fast to any class if you setup your burst at the right time and you actually hit something.
---
It’s probably more likely your build was buffed by the recent patch?
---
Some builds/classes were OP like the scrapper for PvP so if you used the same character months ago and then used it this week you’d find scrapper (and now this week berserker) to be the new meta “broken” class.
---
Sooo if the bosses weren’t needed maybe it’s your build was part of the buff?
---
I wouldn't recommend getting Renegade or Quickness FB as your first character, and neither chrono.
---
Rene and FB are highly specific and might result in longer waiting time for a group willing to take you.
---
Chrono I wouldn't do because there is a rotation to follow, chronos usually do a lot of mechanics and once you decide to get a chrono equipped it is a good idea to have multiple builds for it (which is quite expensive).
---
Druid is just in the right spot and it will teach you a lot. And once you get comfortable there are mechanics druids will handle. You start doing these and eventually you will be ok with doing any mechanic. Which is really valuable for groups down the line (kiter on dhuum, pusher on SH, etc.).
---
Why not? Scourge is the easiest class for boon corrupting in fractals with No Pain No Gain. It’s also great against the new instability [Vengeance.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistlock_Instability:_Vengeance)
---
Actually... The sad part with all of this is, that there is obviously a market for them. Why run 40 accounts to sell stuff for real life money when no one will buy it?
---
But this is the general problem with bots in all games. Some people are willing to spend real life money to buy these things. If that would not be the case, there wouldn't be bots in the first place.
---
why would anyone right in their mind take traits on reaper which gives toughness in pve? same with conditions...like there are so few fights where you get so many condis that it "could" hurt you that it makes so sense at all to waste a whole trait on it.  
---
press 4 on greatsword and everything is blinded. no toughness needed, no condi cleanse needed. and in shroud you do not need any of this too.  
---
this is why so many necromancers are bad in this game. instead of going with a damage traitline so they can actually dish out a bit...they choose tankyness on a facetank class.  
---
gs 4 + well bomb + shroud 4 and anything dies already in normal pve.
---
I wish there were more skimmer races
---
Don't know why you get downvoted but I agree. It is more convenient to blame the bots when in reality, GW1 entered maintenance mode shortly after EotN release. And that was even communicated by Arena Net themselves. And an MMO in maintenance mode is more or less telling the player base that the project is dead for the developer.
---
There are different types of legendaries: weapons, armor, trinkets and backpieces. 
---
Since you mentioned weapons, there’s three types of them: Gen 1 (core), Gen2 (HoT) and Gen 2.5 (sort of). 
---
**Gen 1**
---
• Precursor can be crafted via collection.
---
• Precursor can also be obtained from gambling mystic forge/lucky open world drop or bought from TP.
---
• Cheapest to make compared to the other gens. 
---
**Gen 2**
---
• Precursor can only be crafted. 
---
• Total pain in the ass collection. Requires multiple large HoT metas.
---
• More expensive than Gen 1. 
---
**Gen 2.5**
---
• No collection at all, just require *a lot* of mats. Therefore, expensive. 
---
Since it’s your first legendary, I highly suggest picking something from Gen 1, unless you really really prefer Gen 2s skins. If you do pick Gen 1, take it from someone that crafted Dawn: **No moar! I will never craft another Gen1 Precursor!!!** Just save up and buy the Precursor off TP. 
---
Source: Own 6 legendaries, currently working on Xiuquatl.
---
These numbers aren't amount of ao added per time but rather amount of AP per achievement per time. So that the amount of achievements and the overall amount of ap obtainable rises isn't accounted for.
---
In wvw minstrel scrapper is pretty forgiving when it comes to its rotation as most of its heals are passive, though it’s more based on positioning of your condition clearing
---
But this does not mean that there are less Ap to have. It simply means that individual achievements give less. But there are loads of achievements nowadays that give small amounts of AP making the overall AP you can obtain per LWS higher nowadays.
---
Yo, don't diss the garnished toast, just because we're RPers doesn't mean we can't kick a dick off. We were the gate keepers to T1, YOU'RE WELCOME!
---
This is amazing. Great job
---
 Coming back after long break, got some questions: 
---
1. My loading times are longer than I remember them being, especially in the beginning, it takes a really long time to load into maps (some more than others) - is this something I can improve? I've turned down the graphics as much as I can without it looking like crap but I have a decent computer and I know it wasn't this bad when I started playing GW2 years ago and I had a worse computer then... I'm planning on switching from NA servers to EU (I'm in Europe) - do you think this could help solve the problem?
---
2. Does EU and NA share economy or are there differences between them? Just wondering whether to sell off some inventory before or after moving, or if it doesn't matter.
---
3. What's the main methods for farming gold these days? Mama needs new cosmetics. ;) (Well, and server transfer money...)
---
4. Last time I played was LS4 episode 1: anything else I should be aware of before I dive back in?
---
Ok, you're awesome. And? Doesn't help the class itself.
---
I hear this argument from viablenonoptimal players all the time and it isn't an argument at all.
---
Race does not matter.
---
If you completed core story with any race and any choice then you cannot get more no matter what.
---
Don't be disappointed, core tyria have more than enough points to get them all. Just focus on your most important mastery first and leave others, you may struggle with last few points depending on what content will you play.
---
So for someone who isn’t well-informed, what is AP?
---
He said he completed story once with other hero. That's it, no more masteries from core story.
---
Discord.
---
Not only you will get a way to better communicate with other but also able to do it off game.
---
Made my hairs stand on end. Very good :D
---
I know. But what I mean is that there shouldnt have been AP as a "reward" for Dailys/Monthlys in the first place.
---
Just searching the dudes name gives me articles where he himself says that his own content lately became shit, so I'd take what he says with a huge grain of salt.
---
No? When did you come up with those garbage assumptions?
---
Her neck and torso are seriously freaking me out.
---
A bit off topic: If someone accidentally sells an item on the tp for 2-3 copper it's still the highest buyorder who gets the item. But the buyer then also gets the gold difference refunded.  
---
That happened a lot back when they changed tp minimum prices to match vendor prices
---
I have 2 accounts: one with 25k AP, one with a bit less then 9k. First has legendaries, and well, a ton of useless achievs (dailies and seasonal events). I have more fun on my second account that is just mostly focused on achievment hunting, so I say go for that. Legendaries, while cool, often don’t even match my fasion wars. The gold you spend on a legendary can be spent a lot wiser, to be blunt... Equinox weapons, timekeeper (on top of my head) that look so cool they’re basically legendaries without footsteps. Are footsteps worth 2.2k gold for you? Go for account completion, and legendaries should be the very end of that (because of price)
---
I do Bloodstone Fen and the Season 2 story step where Caithe steels the egg (it rewards a key). Bloodstone Fen takes about 5 mins to complete and has a chance at a key, the story step is pretty fast and rewards a key.
---
Exactly! That kind of tingly feeling of ethereal/exciting adventure! Man, combine that with some nostalgia and  I’m blubbering fool.
---
Thanks! I'll poke around with it.
---
I think it's because a majority of the more recent APs have been pretty much collection based, and to add onto that, the collections tend to encourage the player to hunt it down from all over Tyria.
---
No it is the number of AP from the living story episode in one season which gave the least AP.
---
For example in season 2 episode 1 "Gates of maguuma" gave a total of 38 AP. Episode 4 "The dragons reach Part 2" gave 105 AP
---
nope, you just failed.
---
1 ap? be happy to get that... so many that aint worth anything
---
Healer is laidback if you're in a group of people good enough to know how to dodge, it can become a worse nightmare than messing your DPS rotation.  
---
And I don't consider healing gives you more vision of the fight. As DPS, your rotation is muscle memory so your brain can focus on the actual mechanics while a healer has to monitor his whole group which leads to less focus on the fight itself.  
---
To each their own I guess.
---
Love to see people not beliving my experiences at all. Just based on my name they are taking points down. It was 5 months ago and there were 3 guys working on it&gt;! Jeshimiroll,Lightybug and Astaroth!&lt;. They did great job and Im greatful for them. Also no clue if these guys also solved problems of my other guys because I never asked so there might have been more people involved.
---
Is it sad that I've played the game since early 2013 and still haven't reached 15k daily AP cap? :(
---
&gt;aesthetically
---
Correct. That one's a rough one.
---
~25-30%
---
But its much easier and faster to farm gold then to wait for the daily resets
---
Our bis gear is not depending on your raiding in PvE. Ascended armor you can get from all game modes and also as rewards, crafting and some parts from mapcurrency on specific maps. Gear was never a problem in GW2 because we never raised the level cap nor do our gear get outdated. We have the same bis gear since a bit after the game came out.The only thing you will have to deal with is that new stats get added to the game frequently and stat swapping will be a thing. With ascended it is fairly easy with legendary armor (which have the same stats as ascended gear) you swap when ever out of battle.
---
Until you can swap out your gear exotics works fine. Look at any of the build sides and make builds that match what you intend to do. Higher tiers of fractals will demand ascended gear. Not because you could not make it in exotics, you totally could but it is not possible to slot in agony resistance in exotic gear and why you must have ascended or you wont survive because of agony.
---
Both expacs are worth it. Both offters different things and are independent of eachothers. With HoT you get 9 new elite specs, gliding, biga meta events maps, HoT stats, raid wings (you must own the expac you intend to raid in), HoT story and more. In PoF you get mounts, 9 other new elite specs, PoF stats, a lot of explorations, some meta events, PoF story and more. If you can only pick one i don't know tbh. Both are important parts of GW2 and i would not want to be left out with any of them because it is a lot of content. I would rather wait for sale and pick it up then if money is a issue.
---
Meaningless Statistic.
---
Looks awesome, i kinda would like to order one, too.
---
May i ask what someone pays for such a piece of art?
---
And TC is NA and we have no clue if he is in NA or EU.
---
Autistic potatoes.
---
And I've seen a lot of people projecting their own way of life on others, honestly thinking everybody does it the same way as they do ;)
---
Did you accidentally make an attempt at humor? It surely looked like one, but I'm still in doubt because it likes that most vital humor element ;)
---
I am not awesome. Darevil is so easy that anyone can pull this off with little effort. Just some basic practice and you're good.
---
What I wanted to say is... Daredevil can dish out very good numbers, that's all.
---
No, it's not the case. Weaver wasn't buffed in those patches. They did some questionable changes to m-h dagger, but I use dagger in o-f, my main sources of DPS is sword.
---
Sweet view!
---
You find the diving goggles?
---
That's a good point, but it still a very meager increase in damage. If it would be just 5-10% more DPS, I wouldn't even felt it, or I would definitely thought I imagine it. But it felt like they had twice less HP than normally, instead. Hydras died twice as fast as before.
---
Not really. It's over 4 years worth of doing 3 dailies each day, without missing a single one or taking any breaks from the game. Realistically, it can't be expected for most players to have reached that limit yet. I've been playing since launch, took the odd break and as of today, i'm still 425 days away from hitting the limit.
---
5: You can see [rankings and match ups here](https://wvwstats.com/eu) can also see a full list of [EU servers here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World#Europe) with populations.
---
Okay. And now make a statistic for the number of achievements per release to see if it actually got less overall or not.
---
First of all to know about is that GW2 will never tell you what to do or were to go, you simply do what you WANT to do. At first just explore, learn the way to walk, use abilities, find out what npc's are, what they sell and were they are, figure out how enemie fights, try all your weapons out, learn the weapon swap, what a break bar is and how that works and so on. GW2 is a skillbased game so you need to be aware of enemies and counter them.
---
I leave a link about breakbars here. Game never teach you about it but it is super important to know about and something you deal with all the time every were. https://youtu.be/ZvC4GtQXKHA
---
At the start everything is super easy. Endgame wont really be that. To help you out with pointers i will paste my wall of text that i usually paste to new players so if you want to try something else out you now have things to choose from. At the end there is also a link to show you the endgame content of GW2. Mind though i did not check that post through in a few months so might be missing some new content.
---
Again remember that leveling is not really what the endgame will look like. Endgame at lvl 80 is very different and a lot more fun more engaging and tons of things to do so don't judge the game from the leveling, keep on doing it until you reach 80, it will go fast enough.
---
GW2 also have a very easy way of leveling since the percentage of xp for each level is the same from 15 up to 80, so you wont have millions and millions of xp to grind the last 10 levels as other mmo's do.
---
Anyway things to do in game whilst you level: Heart Quests. A lot of new players get tunnel vision around the heart quests and just grind them until they get bored to death. See the hearts as a mark on the map were you do the hearts whilst follow up on the event in the area. Events is always your number one focus and usually you have finished the heart quests whilst doing so. If you feel you don't want to do a heart, then don't. There is no reason to do anything in this game that you do not like.
---
Events and event chains. A lot of events start at one point but if you follow it, it will move to another event and to another and in the end you are suddenly at a huge world boss event or on the other side of the map. Always do events, big and small. They give you karma and xp.
---
Worldboss/world event. All start areas except for the charrs have a world boss placed in them that spawns every third hour. You will get karma, xp and one time each day you get a big reward chest as well. At lvl 40 you will get a bonus chest with a rare item. You can make the event as many times as you want and you always get xp and karma from it, but only one time a day you get the chest and the bonus chest from each boss. When you are leveling up there will be more bosses out there in other regions, so keep track on them. This timer is good to use for that. http://gw2timer.com/ There are other timers as well so just pick your favorite.
---
Map and world completion. Each map can be completed by making the heart quests, finding all way points, vistas and points of interest. When you got them all on the map you are in, you will get nice chunk of xp and good loot such as keys or transmutation charges, gear for the level of the map, and crafting material. If you make all maps in the game you will finish world completion which will reward you with a item you need for crafting legendaries, and ofc some other loot. Also each race start area have a open waypoint outside of their racial city. So no need to stay only in your start area. There is nothing negative to go to the other races areas, and a good way of changing the view :)
---
Gathering and crafting. When ever you move in the open world you will pass gathering nodes. Never pass them without gatherer. Tools for gathering you can usually find at the normal npc who sell things or at any crafting station. Gathering give you xp, and it also give you crafting material which you will need to craft gear/weapons/jewelry/food. Crafting materials also give good income on the Trading Post. Crafting is very important in this game. You will be able to craft your endgame gear, both exotic and ascended. It is the highest end game gear you can have. The good part about level your crafting whilst you level your character is that you get xp from it and about 7 levels from each crafting discipline. Note though that the higher up you get in crafting the more expensive or rather time consuming it will be to get the material, so don't tunnel vision on it, craft when you have it and leave it in between. Crafting can look scary at first but always check Wiki if you ever are in doubt on how to go on. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crafting
---
You can also watch this video that show you the basics of crafting https://youtu.be/lRsQuniqdXs
---
Dungeons. Your first story dungeon start at lvl 30. Story is the easier path in the dungeon that introduce you to it, in a way that wont wreck you, but not too easy either. It give good loot and loads of xp. Roughly nearly a level with boosters and food on. If there are no groups in the lfg-tool make one. Add what path, add all welcome and it will fill up fast enough. Here is a guide of the basics around dungeons. https://youtu.be/jLhWVTG1nas And here are a very old guide but it have the tactics and are still usefull http://gw2dungeons.net/ Youtube also have a lot of videos to check out if you want more information.
---
S-PvP. You can enter the PvP lobby at lvl 2 (3 if f2p account) There are no gear grind or other requirements to get in to PvP, which means that gear is normalized and will just as competitive with your stats as someone that played the game for years. What you wont have is the skill-knowledge that old players have and that is what you will need to focus on when you start doing pvp, learning how to defend your self whilst killing the other. Knowing when to get out and when to stay and so on. PvP is a great way to get to know your class. It also give you really nice loot through the reward tracks. In those tracks there will be rewards such as level scrolls (1 lvl on your char for each scroll), you get exotic weapons and different tokens for exotic gear and so on that you can use when you reach lvl 80. A good PvP guide to watch before you start https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pJkt8Van4w
---
WvW. There are also World verses World, which is a instanced open world pvp between 3 servers, over 4 big maps going on 24/7 for a week with reset every friday. If you have a f2p account you are restricted and can not join until lvl 60. World verses world will give you zerg fights, group fights, smaller fights between one to a few players. You fight over kills and structures. The team with most points in the end of the week win the matchup.
---
Jumping puzzles, activities and mini dungeons. Well they can seem trivial, but the fact is at the end of every jumping puzzle in the game there is a chest that give you good loot. The same goes for the mini dungeons, just small areas with a bit of a challenge and a nice chest at the end. A list of them you find here: http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini-dungeon Activities is like a mini game were you compete with other players but for fun. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Activity There is a npc at the Grand Piazza in Lions Arch that will take you to activity of the day. Talk to her and join the fun.
---
Personal story. At every 10 level you get a new chapter of your personal story. This give you loads of xp and it tells you the story of the core game and whats going on. It also rewards you with Black Lion keys, dyes, boosters, gear and what not. You should try and make the full story on at least one character. It is totally worth it.
---
Special event: Over the years there have been story chapter that added some special events around Tyria. Those are Bandit leaders, Legendary Ley line boss, Joko invasions, Rifts, Ley energy events and some more. You will run in to some when you leveling and do jump in and try to do you best. If players give directions listen to them because some events are on a timer. It is level 80 content that been scaled down so it is many times harder then your normal map events but they also often give better loot and a lot of xp and a taste of what to come.
---
All this and ofc exploring the game and go were you want to go is what gets you to lvl 80.
---
If you fancy lore then GW2 have loads of it, but you will have to stop and listen to npc, read up on what they have to say, watch dialogues play out and every now and then you run in to something that is important for future events to come. A-Net love to place those little things in to the game.
---
So stop focus on only heart quests, get out in the world and pick what ever you feel like doing for the day.
---
If this still make you feel like it is not your cup of tea, then if you get any of the expansions, or both you will get a lvl 80 boost for each expac. There is also lvl 80 boost to buy in the gem store. Mind though that i would never recommend to use it on your first character because you skip the entire part of learning the game in a good pace and at end game there will be no hints or pointers to what you should do now. GW2 is a game were you set your own end game goals both long term and short term. But i will still add this info since there are players who still feel it is a better way to get in to a game and capable of handle the overwhelming feeling that will hit you after a boost.
---
I also leave a link to my other wall of text i usually post but that is about endgame and have links to how this looks like so you know what to look forward too. https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/akdbsy/its_probably_that_question_again/ef42768/
---
then put the money in a buy order for a permanent makeover kit or whatever other item you deem stable enough
---
&gt;Yeah here 150 skills with 90% useless
---
If out of 150 skills 90% are useless, why is less skills to choose from better?
---
I now am imagining Balthazar giving build advice to fellow war enthusiasts. Thanks
---
Could you delete a Guild? I thought u could only pass it to someone.
---
Further explanation: In order for a 100g buy order on that infusion (for example), every buy order above 100g would have to be completed and/or rescinded. Money's damn safe if you ask me.
---
I mentioned that indirectly, cause I said that there are more achievments in the newer living stories.
---
I think they changed the number of AP because in the early living stories it took only a couple of hours to get all AP. Now you have to play the content over a period of days or weeks to get all done. It is a way to keep people playing the new living stories over a longer time.  I dont think that is the best solution to keep people playing but it is one solution.
---
And I agree, some achievments feel so useless to do cause they award only 1AP.
---
I just find skimpier armour to be more fun, it’s just a game not like I would wear it irl lmao.
---
The opposite's happened over the last few years. Season 4 has more AP per ep than S3, which has more than S2. The eps do come out less frequently though.
---
depends on what you mean by worth it?
---
is it fun - yes.
---
do you have lots to do if you haven't played since before HoT - yes.
---
is it still "alive" - pretty much.
---
Keep in mind newer players don't understand half the lingo you're using.
---
The wardrobe section of your *equipment tab* only shows you what you've unlocked for weapon and armor skins, but the mount, glider, outfit, etc. sections allow previews of unlocked skins.
---
However, the wardrobe section of your *bank* displays all weapon and armor skins in the game (minus a handful that are hidden until acquired). It's a good way to find a look, since you can mix and match with almost anything in the preview window.
---
think you forgeting festivals - from last year, each one (and we got - lunar new year, SAB, bazar, halloween and wintersday - so 5) give 50 AP + some -so there is 250 AP per year just there
---
I dont argue with your statements - we got too few and to little AP - just not sure if you count these ones
---
Weapon bound skills were announced pretty early. 
---
And also at least Anet's devs knew about it *and* wanted it while planing, you your statement "*nobody* wanted or knew about it" is just Wrong.
---
We can have it, we have it and it's great. 
---
Stop thinking you own opinion is a fact that counts for all and also stop speaking for other people, you represent nobody. There is no "*we*" for anything you said, there only is a "**you**". 
---
It's **your** opinion, not anybody else's and especially no facts.
---
You make a fair point: the PvE healing Firebrand build uses (or can use, at least) the same gear as WvW support FB. There's a handful of issues with that, though:
---
* Minstrel gear is really expensive as a first set, since you can't get it via the TP, so you're going to be waiting on a lot of reward tracks to get even an exotic set going.
---
* If you ever do raids, Minstrel gear from the WvW build means you'll have excessive toughness and will almost always have to be the group tank, which is very bad for learning.
---
* Minstrel's is *terrible* for open world, unless you just really enjoy hitting basic enemies for a minute while tickling them to death. Given that's one of OP's primary play modes, getting a gear set that will actively inhibit play there while *maybe* allowing future group play is a bad call.
---
* Healbrand just isn't that desirable in Fractals. If your group is running the FB/Rev combo, the Rev is preferred as a healer while the FB goes for more damage (or, potentially, both classes go primarily damage with only splashes of incidental healing, depending on how confident the group is). Locking in Healbrand means you're limited to not only the subset of groups running the FB/Rev combo, but the subset of *that* subset that wants the Healbrand option.
---
Now, Healbrand is very fun and it's absolutely viable in group content! It's just a rather poor choice for your first/only set of PvE gear since it fits into so few groups.
---
(Incidentally, I agree with you about stat selection, I can't stand Harrier gear.)
---
If you manually fix coverage in your alliance you're already intentionally stacking which we know anet cant deal with or solve.
---
If you do NOT stack then you're at the mercy of RNG which fixes nothing.
---
Tell me again how alliances should address coverage when an alliance is far from the whole server?
---
Keep in mind that all achievements come additional to all achievements we already have. 
---
So even at the lowest points in the graph, let's say HoT release, you still have all the achievements from LS2 and the core game. 
---
That means even if it looks like we get less achievements, we actually get more and more.
---
I think if you're the only member then to leave the guild just deletes it.
---
Just easier to not have to worry about sharding in, but yeah that's true. I did that for a while when I was on Jade quarry before finally transferring over-- and it was people wanting to do WvW that had me do it.
---
To me it does detract from the experience to be forced to for example have to finish my main story to be allowed to do anything in FFXIV, or have to do specific tasks to start raiding in both WoW and FFXIV. Not to mention the constant need for ilvl grind in both.
---
Going through a huge checklist of boring/unrelated stuff every time I want to do something gets old super fast.
---
&gt; If you manually fix coverage in your alliance you're already intentionally stacking which we know anet cant deal with or solve.
---
That's the whole point of Alliances. So active guilds can stack to get coverage. Servers aren't relevant anymore in this system. And WvW match-ups are small enough that one alliance can provide enough players.
---
So you end up with active alliances who have to make sure they have coverage fighting each other at the top. And all the random smaller or less active guilds will be thrown together at the lower end of the rankings.
---
It's reskinned immortal greatsword \#lore
---
I agree on the pp Deadeye and it looks fantastic with hope so you're on the right track!
---
You are complaining that changing weapons changes the rotation? Isn't that the entire point, changing skills so your skills (and thus rotation) changes?
---
had that discussion not too long in LA with some dude.  
---
his argument was: you could play whatever, mix and match skills....for example playing some hammer build and doing more damage / extra effects on dudes which are knocked and shit like that...  
---
my only answer to that was: thats basically the power warrior meta right now...cc, switch weapons, burst.  
---
its just not only your skills anymore, but way more diversity when it comes to runes, sigils and traits.
---
It looks nothing like the [immortal greatsword](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Immortal_Greatsword_Skin) though...
---
The only thing TC did right was have a ton of people around the clock.
---
That's not the case any more, and is unlikely to ever be again
---
Every episode in seasons 3 and 4 comes with a new map.
---
Every episode of season 3 did add new maps. 
---
Season 2 were giving Dry Top and Silverwastes a bit at a time, but you don't need the episodes in order to access the areas.
---
I'll describe it best I can. It looks hard, but it's easy in chunks.
---
You swap between Shiro and Mallyx. Each one uses a different wep.
---
Mallyx rotation:  
---
F1 to swap to Mallyx (when below 10 energy on Shiro to proc 75 energy)
---
Weapon Swap to Shortbow
---
SB4, SB2, SB3
---
Unyielding Anguish/the stomp that does AoE.   Use it twice.
---
SB2  twice
---
Use Embrace the Darkness and SB4, SB2, SB3, and SB2 until energy drains.
---
The grace period is before using your elite. As long as you get 2x SB2 and 2x Unyielding Anguish before having to proc your elite, you're safe. 
---
Shiro:
---
Swap to Shiro legend  when Mallyx is less than 10 energy.
---
Swap to Mace/Axe.
---
Mace 2, Mace 3, Axe 5,
---
Citadel Bombardment, activate impossible odds.
---
Spam Mace2 and Mace3 off cd until under10 energy.
---
Swap to Mallyx and repeat above.
---
Condi rev is hilariously easy, rofl.
---
you can enter the season 2 maps (dry tops and silverwaste) without any of the episodes, you only require it for season 3 and 4 where each episode comes with a different map
---
Consensus seems to be its damage is good but very conditional. For pugs its fine if your enemies are monkeys. If they are capable if pressing buttons on necro you wont do much. 
---
Small groups with stealth and support that can land thr damage and play around melee can pull it off as well. Surfing on trash "blobz" made up of monkeys also works great. Fighting as pugs against pugs that are half organised it's pretty bad.
---
So another situational class which gets pushed out of pug viability because pugs are special snowflakes that demand /their/ situational spec to be great no matter the situation, and because half the players act this way at all times the situation can never arise.
---
Distilled from the people I've talked with because wvw hasn't been playable since the patch for me personally.
---
Right now you can open only one instance of any game on lutris. That may change in the future.
---
&gt; Ppt was meaningless in EU for decades just because everyone realises offhours coverage monkeyism is too dominant for score yet too dull and meaningless to bother with.
---
So there really isn't a problem then. If people cared, they would fix it wth Alliances. But since most players (including the supposed hardcore ones) don't reall give a shit, then they won't. They just loose the opportunity to endlessly whine about bad matchups.
---
To everyone who replied, thank you! Like I mentioned, I couldn't find any information on the matter anywhere. I'll probably be picking up all the Living World episodes over time, but I wanted to prioritize the ones with new zones to explore.
---
While choosing a weapon you will most likely use with your classes makes sense, have in mind that those classes have many different variations of weapons that are meta. Greatsword atm is meta in power Reaper, Power Dragon Hunter and power Chrono. Warrior does not use greatsword I believe, uses axe. But the greatsword build is almost just as good. 
---
So choosing the greatsword is a safe bet. We just recently had released the preview of the 2nd gen too so you can see which you prefer. 
---
However, I recommend you looking up the other weapons and choose the one you like the most, taking in consideration if it is meta on a toon of yours.
---
your hands deserve an acoustic piano!! amazing rendition &lt;3
---
He smites cheapskates for using budget food, and he uses illegal software to check people's gear.
---
They probably see your name and instantly know you're an ape.
---
Hey, thanks for the in-depth. I'm planning on exploring the areas soon, and I'll take note to stock up on Clean Refreshing Drinks for Bitterfrost Frontier (10% Reduced Condition Duration), should help a tiny bit.
---
But yeah, I'm just getting into the Living World stuff. Originally I thought it was just small side-story things that didn't really have much impact on the game, so I assumed it wasn't really worth bothering with. Boy was I wrong!
---
Scepter mirage/Chrono still has a place in some bosses aswell
---
I'm sorry, but what is this pose? It's like the artist was sooo desperate to include both tits and ass.
---
OMG.... thank you
---
It's really not 'retarded', I'm older with responsibilies and have to cherry pick what I do in my free time, and rather than waste 10 hours trying to get into it, researching, etc I decided to come to the place where I'd get an honest answer from those who are passionate. 🤷‍♀️
---
Yup and they are about off cooldown when I swap back to gs.
---
its not worth getting into, thats why we have 204k subscribers, absolutely dead game
---
If they release them individually then I want a refund on the ones I do not use from the pack.
---
I always thought that was Vlast and not Aurene. Elonians outside of Joko's kingdom know and are fond of Vlast. But, Aurene first came to this region when Balthazar kills you.
---
Thanks! I totally forgot about treks, I'll have a look into it.
---
"A Star to Guide us" (s4e4) introduced Jahai, which is a fantastic map. I also really like Thunderhead Peaks from "All or Nothing" (s4e5), Bloodstone Fen from "Out of the Shadows" (s3e1) and Draconis Mons from "Flashpoint" (s3e5). Bitterfrost Frontier from "A Crack in the Ice" (s3e3) isn't a super amazing map, but people still go there a lot to farm winterberries for the ascended accessories, so it's good to have it opened and available.
---
Again, Outrider is the warclaw without the armor. The horns are not natural, they are armor.
---
Curious to see if they'll ever do this. I can't shake the idea that everyone will buy the most unique one (the one that looks like a leopard/cheetah) and that'll be it.
---
I would think so too, but this is really clearly in Aurene's colors. Maybe the devs intended Vlast to also be blue at some point? Maybe they made the mobile blue so WE would know who it is?
---
WOW, that looks so good!
---
If you are aiming for pvp simply go into pvp and try out these builds, every character is equal in pvp, so you can simply create a char and try out :)
---
What’s the sword?
---
&gt; But it could also mean that LS1 had tons of 1 AP achievements, but LS3 had more 0 AP ones.
---
&gt;
---
&gt; The actual case is that LS2, LS3, LS4 as well as HoT have 0 AP achievements for every story chapter.
---
* That's fair. I omitted some of the 0 AP achievements where I could (e.g., those ones for defeating developers in various places) but I wasn't particularly rigorous about it.
---
* There's also the introduction of new low-AP achievements that don't replace more traditional achievements (e.g., mastery insights, adventures). It's not a zero-sum game (except for those 0 AP achievements!).
---
Your initial analysis of the achievement spread is a good one. There's a bit of noise due to the achievement system being somewhat overloaded to expose partial achievement progress (although it's interesting to notice the difference across episodes with FTT &gt; Requiem &gt; Dragonsblood achievements).
---
I think you're right that this unfairly glosses over the nuances of AP distribution.
---
Only to be played for luls. It's a "casual" class sorta meant for entry-level players. You can even get that same sentiment from the comments. Most veteran players will sayyy that it's viable or that you can find a way but in the bottom of their hearts they know the truth. They just sorta get used to having to make excuses for necro in general for the sake of their loyalty to the game. 
---
You'll find more groups, add more to the groups, and overall experience the game as a REAL player instead of a filthy casual. Any necro symbol above your head equates to "nub casual who enjoys forgiving classes". 
---
I mean its no different from say a card game. You'll have your REAL decks, which are competetive and meant for the dedicated gamers and then you have your casual decks that are just for fun and simple to understand and super forgiving. The latter is the necromancer across the board. Doesn't matter if you're core (pls god no), reaper or scourge. 
---
Again, play it for fun. Play it just because its got a cool look or whatever but don't expect to be treated like the rest of the classes because necro's simply are not. It's a design thing. They're meant to be the casual class. This dungeon / fractal stigma isn't new and has always been treated as a liability. It's not really the players fault either because again, it's a design choice made by the devs. There's no "skillful" necro build lol. It has a super obvious purpose and a super obvious playstyle which sorta underperforms most of the time; or overperforms in pvp since if it gets any decent damage or survivability (or any combination) it's too much of a hassle so it HAS to underperform to be "balanced".
---
Take it in WvW where individuality doesn't matter that much lol. Spam keys and do dps.
---
Tengu
---
Here's the real question, what made you leave in the first place?
---
oof
---
The Shining Blade. The proportions are way off.
---
“Lag script” lol.  It’s not his cheap ass dialup connection for sure.
---
I dont really care what your real name is, I just call you what i want, donald.
---
Glad you're enjoying it. Don't be afraid to ask questions.
---
Definitely the sword that can kill Krallkatorrik. Now, who will carry it? Either the sword is a red herring but you can forge it anyway OR Caithe will get it. Marjory is the only one carrying a greatsword but she already has her dead sister so...
---
Don't mean to be rude, but you didn't try at all if you found nothing on the wiki.
---
Scrapper bunker is the same build gyro bunker?
---
Anet stated they are also looking to change the window of matches to 8 hours to see if it helps with that issue. Off-time ppting is not an issue addressed with Alliances and match ups, it is a flaw from the system that manages that.
---
In the end, your argument of "innocent until proven guilty" swings both ways. OP came to reddit and made claims against Anet Support without providing any proof that any of this even happened.
---
Full points here. They could use a stolen credit card to 'obtain' (I would not call that buying) an account. Since stolen credit cards take a few days to be noticed, they'd simply 'obtain' them when they need them, do their thing - and not really care much if the account gets banned for payment fraud within these 5-7 days.
---
Fraud. It's why we can't have nice things.
---
I think it's Glint, not Aurene. 
---
Only a few people (our people) even knew that Aurene exists, until she ate Balthazars magic and started fighting awakened afterwards. 
---
Glint on the other hand is well known in Elona since hundreds of years. And she was some kind of a protector for Elonians. I just fits that they make effigies of Glint as symbols of protection. And maybe also for the kids.

https://www.twitch.tv/ezekychannel/clip/TrustworthySassyLampDatBoi It's fun

I was trying to avoid getting into a debate regarding the player's gender by specifying the character's gender and  associated pronouns, because the point wasn't at all to say gender affects ability to lead (I don't think it does at all)
---
It's not impossible for people who love a game to be able to see its flaws and give an objective opinion, and a subreddit is a good place to find that.
---
You've contributed absolutely nothing to this discussion.
---
Maine Coon is definitely a nice breed, I like them a lot
---
Or to be more specific a typical male norn guardian!
---
i need a chain whip weapon now
---
"Just" creating a guild?
---
His way is significantly more easier and far more appropriate to use the word "just" as you literally pick an expensive item and "just" place the buy order.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOery2pF0NA
---
You say a month of fairly casual play for all exotics?
---
I mean...Silverwastes farm is like 15g/hr minimum right? That's nearly enough to buy an entire set right there after an hour of play.
---
Even doing a single HoT Meta will probably give you at least 5g in terms of rewards, and they take like half an hour.
---
You can get the gold for full exotics in a week's time without even trying. Just play and don't spend your money on anything else. The ~20g it costs will be there in no time.
---
Axe toy on Revenant with [Impossible Odds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Impossible_Odds) is a blast.  Still useful in the few places you can’t mount, like dungeons &amp; fractals.
---
Yeah, well, that's just, like, your fashion choice, man.
---
There is also a light head skin (bone armor or something) that for some reason comes with a set of shoulders that replace all other shoulders.
---
Surprisingly, the shoulder skin of that same set is the exact same as the one you get with the head skin. Its absolutely useless.
---
i would buy that, the fire and branded ones.
---
I do have a ton of those. My mains bags are loaded I don’t even know what to do.
---
I'm sorry you're too clueless to have a reasonable discussion with. About everything you've said is at best misinformed. Sorry.
---
People learn not to care due to terrible design which literally doesn't allow the game to be played in a healthy and fun way. That doesn't mean it doesn't matter, much less that it shouldn't be improved.
---
Yeah I remember that, thats why I was so confused. I thought I stumbled into some 6yo thread.
---
Meh, doesn't matter what you're wearing, you're still gonna have that purple aesthetic with your skills and butterflies flying around.
---
Which event?
---
Since scrapper is the only spec utilizing gyros by now, yeah you two should be referring to more or less the same build.
---
I do like GW2 tanks more though. You do more than just stand there taking hits. Playing one and actually having to know the skills is such a gold experience.
---
Ok.
---
You’re doing the lords work today, my son.
---
I mean it's a story-based looter shooter. If an MMO like Guild Wars was released without those features there would certainly be an uproar but less people care about that sort of thing with looter shooters
---
Some people recommended me Guardian for PvP (not bunker, Core), and they were right. Radiant Hammer/Greatsword is really fun and awesome for climbing, and Burst Burning, while not as effective in every situation as them, feels good, looks good and the burst is insane.
---
I got 7-3 in my first placements with Guardian, so definitely is a good class.
---
I'd love some plate mail only mesmer. The nearest I can get is a swashbuckling aesthetic with bounty hunter and elegy gear... but yeah. 
---
Contrastingly, my guardian is in full plate armour and shoots out fire and light like a disco ball at a Rammstein concert.
---
And when you give more AP per achievement, people start complaining that it's too easy to get the points nowdays.
---
The base game is free-to-play, you do not have to buy it. You only have to buy the expansion(s).
---
[You forgot this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/195/575/abf.jpg)
---
Scourge, scrapper, firebrand, herald, berserker(depending on size), spellbreaker
---
guild wars 2 base game is free to play. as soon as you buy one or both expansions (hopefully from a legit [retailer](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#UnitedStates-physical)) free to play restrictions are lifted!
---
New elite spec (can equip heavy armor now). Would actually be pretty cool.
---
Base game is free so you only need to add HoT and PoF keys to your Account.
---
gameladen.com sells them cheap, but its German so you might check ihr mmoga or others as well
---
This isn't an update to the game, it's a new game.
---
The last game the developers made in this series was literally at the same time as gw2 released, when this stuff *was* a major selling point.
---
thanks! deffo going for stylized, so if oyu find it too anime then i did something right :p
---
wowowow hello!
---
There also AP and fashion wars.  
---
If a character is flashy i know he put a lot of effort \^\^
---
I feel like spamming aoes and build catas behind gates to prevent gate siege is very lame. you should use walls or engage the enemy through a surprise attack. You already have a big advantage where you can use the gate to come out and burst the enemy, as your backline can quickly run away if things go wrong.
---
I mean outfits *are* an option, but I agree that actual armor skins would be nice.
---
I wouldn't mind an other mmorpg tank
---
At least one
---
That's actually a [bat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bat_\(NPC\)).
---
Bats in gw2 are actually tiny wyverling, not flying mamals.
---
I guess my pov could be skewed as the only MMOs I actively play anymore are SWTOR and GW2, and they both have those three features
---
Yeah, you don't just stand there and take hits without doing anything in other MMOs either. Not sure what you're talking about there.
---
And what do you propose to alleviate the issue. WvW can only work, currently, with grouping players from different regions. That will always result in different primetimes for each player, thus perfect balance in that regard is not achievable. Having the windows be of 8 hours instead of 2 will help a bit, as the largest difference in time between EU regions is \~5 hours.
---
I'm a simple man, i se JoJo i upvote
---
And in the middle that's what a tank is in BDO.
---
GW2 breaking the WoW mold was an act of salvation for the MMO genre. We still deal with the fallout of a whole generation being conditioned towards gear treadmill and quest hubs being the ultimate game designs, but it lead to a lot of innovation despite the grind-trained consumers. And thank fuck for that.
---
welcome to the internet buddy, congrats you made it past day 1 !
---
That's why I mention the permeability. If AoEs can't go far past the gate, people can avoid the catapult damage and other AoEs like necromancer marks by putting some distance to the gate isntead dropping the ram right on top of the gate, then it'll make more interesting to have a shield generator protecting cannons and oils rather than spamming aoes at the gate from far behind it.
---
Dude thinks gearscore is the heart of soul of MMOs. *shudders*
---
I hope they don't do that for an expac, there's so many better options for mesmers
---
what exactly is the point of this post?
---
The Pre-Sequel was released in 2014.
---
Oh that doesn't sound bad. Thank you!
---
&gt; ...but she already has her dead sister so...
---
lol
---
My reply got lost somehow.
---
&gt; *That's quite a claim*, I don't doubt you though looking at your AP and Laurels.
---
Sorry, I meant to say "all that I needed."  Buy them all and posting that PSA would be shady as shit.  This AP collection was really poorly thought-out and something that, I believe, ANet should properly address and never do again.
---
Thief hands down. Fast single target damage (pistol or dagger). Good cleave (dagger) and tag (shortbow 1 and 2). Also good mobility with the movement speed signet and shortbow 5.
---
Any account upgrade key removes the limitations, even if it's a "Heroic Edition" or "Standard Edition" with no expansion content. 
---
Heroic/Standard editions are no longer sold by ANet, since the core content is free. So to remove those limitations when buying the game directly from them, the only option is getting one or more of the expansions.
---
So yeah, getting PoF will remove the restrictions.
---
This guy sounds like a giant douche. The publicity from his stream would be good, but he would not be a good addition to our community.
---
Boss rush week, starts on Sunday or Monday iirc
---
Do I get to become the most OP character in the series?
---
Glad to know that.
---
Circlejerk for karma.
---
And it's working.
---
Sadly, the male version looks like a fungal infection.
---
I did give actual arguments to your initial statements - which were honestly laughable - and you again responded like an idiot. So I'll simply treat you as such, and keep attempts at meaningful discussion for people who won't respond with entirely random nonsense. 
---
Even in this last post, I outlined WHY your response is retarded. I'll try outline it again just for the benefit of the doubt. Notice how you literally didn't give any reasoning at all in this last post, despite crying about exactly that.
---
You have a PPT system which invalidates 99% of the regular players who have jobs / school / etc while greatly increasing the effect of anyone who can play when nobody else does. The middle of the night and early morning being exceptionally good. IF you do play then, you also have none to play with or against which further makes it unfun. 
---
So the "BEST" way to win coverage wars on EU is by quitting your job which is plain not feasible for most players; and related to what is considered very unfun gameplay by most of the players. This issue was repeatedly outlined at the start of the game, more than 6 years ago. On top of that, there are zero rewards for winning. 
---
So you have a system that TEACHES players not to care for PPT - because of how heavily skewed PPT is against them. Even the few players that do actually start doing off-prime PPT for the sake of winning burn out. 6 years later; by virtue of having this godawful system, you've taught the players not to care about PPT. It's not like they don't want a wincondition - it's that the wincondition is SO FUCKING BAD everyone has learned not to care. 
---
Yet your response to that is "oh, well since nobody cares there isn't a problem at all? :D". Without acknowledging that, sure people do not care, there is a huge list of problems associated with not having a win condition or common goal in WvW due to how badly this system is managed.
---
Hence - you took the current state of WvW; took an element from it, extrapolated to some easy solution to try and be witty. Or you're a half wit. I honestly don't know. Either way, I don't want to continue discussing this because I don't think you have anything meaningful to say; so I'll just end up wondering why you keep writing complete bs - and then you'll REEEEE when someone states it's complete bs.
---
Any gear changes?
---
Based on the colour and well the last episode being all about making branded weapons to fuck up kralk minions more effectively its not a stretch to see a connection. I figure if its tied into the lore somehow it could be made from aurenes body or maybe caithe (she now a dragon minion x2) although i see the caithe angle as a more wild theory. It could even be a sword commissioned for the commander to use while fighting along side aurene.... it just wasnt finished in time.
---
Not all legendary weapons have to be lore friendly. More moots and pony bows pls.
---
It’s still decent in PVE if you need large cleave damage. But otherwise, Sword overtakes it by a lot, and even scepter/warhorn does better single target dps
---
Am I going crazy or do they not have a definitive time when guild chat starts?
---
Use an outfit. It's probably the more accurate way to do it.
---
Alright, thanks to everyone for the answers. And yes, I acknowledge that there is a slight chance of being banned, but honestly, I have some time to kill before classic wow is out and gw2 seems like a great mmo to do so.
---
meh.  I don't really like the level scaling or lack of shared loot for a game like borderlands.  maybe enable it for legendaries/uniques, but part of the game is the communal looting/passing out loot.
---
the dropped loot matching char level is nice, but with the level scaling...it just seems like there's no point to having "levels" anymore.
---
and i only asked because sure seemed like you were trying to be all edgy by talking shit about another game series that has nothing to do with GW2
---
, hold my hand.  
---
In other words,
---
Sword/Focus? Not meta enough.
---
might help if you labeled the issue correctly. that has nothing to do with tempest, that's a weaver issue.
---
Perfect.
---
Can i get a preview on the new DD rota plz???
---
Nice necro, that's all.
---
&gt; The legendary collections are the most egregious in this regard. Each step should be worth 10, completions should be worth 25.
---
...or, alternatively, it could be worth as little as possible to not force AP-hunters to go for overpriced items that they don't desire.
---
Just tagging in with others, using skills to say alive is much better on ele than tanking up. You could try out WvW if your server is active enough. You can earn new skill points to spend there, and Staff backline ele is as good as ele gets. You build zerk and use skills and allies to live.
---
Iirc there are also some medium chest pieces that do this too.
---
And published by a different company
---
Yeah I was confused before I realized what the issue really was.
---
As staff ele in open world what you need to do is kite around enemies so they spend as long as possible standing in your aoe
---
Headphone user warning.
---
ye, until I get stung. Of course there is always a risk, but its not such a big one for me.
---
Or are you one of those People that doesnt watch movies on "illegal" sites and always buys the music they listen to?
---
hiss watchers are degenerates, id hate to see him start playing and drag his wasp-hive infected viewers into our playerbase.
---
I watch him from time to time, he sounds like a good entertainer but man he is stupid.
---
You are looking for a game that gives you list of things to do, therefore gw2 isnt the game for you,but dont be a fucking melon about it when you find out how many of us are there, just ackowledge its existance.
---
 End of story
---
Even better, the Crusader in Heroes of the Storm is named Johanna, and the community nicknames her JoJo.

They just need to get rid of armor type transmutation restrictions period. Their excuse about being identifiable in wvw/pvp doesn't hold up anymore, which means it's just an arbitrary restriction. As far as clipping goes, just let it clip. Players will work around it or get over it, it's not like there aren't 100 other things that clip as it is.

How do you tank in GW2? I thought every boss had different aggro mechanics (like highest healer, dps, or toughness, or random selection, etc) I’m not suggesting GW2 become a static tanking experience I enjoy the active dodging and blocking mechanics, but under the current system building tanky seems to be pointless since you can’t secure aggro therefore making you a dps liability. This is an honest question, not a hyperbolic sarcastic one.
---
... can I see it?
---
or i could just play sword and do the same thing but with better defensive features?
---
Or just use some forge man pieces
---
There Is only tanking in Raids, and right now the meta Is Chronotank
---
Unless u want just the shoulder skin
---
As sword you go in and hit them.
---
As staff you kite them and stay at range.
---
At no point should you be doing the same thing.
---
Hahaha, that is amazing!
---
tanks? don't you mean target practice?
---
Aight, here's what I think they should do to fix most of this mess. Related to coverage, PPT as well as rewards and pop balance. 
---
\-**PPT needs to scale with the amount of players in WvW**. Can be evened out over time, and SHOULD be measured across ALL servers of a region to avoid abuse of this system. This means you will get points quicker during prime time. Only has to count for the "defense" ticks as kills naturally scale with players. \[This is required to fix the coverage balance issue, partly\]
---
\-**Give alliances FULL SERVER CONTROL.** Introduce reasonable playercap for alliances. A server literally is an alliance. You can transfer by being invited to a different alliance. A player can be KICKED from an alliance. There is NO shuffling or reshuffling of players or guilds. Players can move around as they please - as long as they are invited by an alliance. Firstly, this provides something that links fully fucked : stability in a community allowing it to grow. Secondly it allows WvW to get actual rewards for "winners"; because people can't simply transfer to the best side. Thirdly it allows actual matchmaking because it creates an environment where winning can matter. Lastly - even with coverage rebalanced maintaining somewhat equal coverage is required for high PPT. 
---
This means alliances looking to WIN recruit actively for the timezones in which they LACK. The opposite of the current system. This also means alliances which are overstacked and have heavy queue issues are promoted to shift focus towards other timezones. Again, this is the opposite of the current system, which promotes heavily stacking a single timezone for "personal gain" at the expense of the gamemode. 
---
\-**Give actual rewards for winning.** Since you can't simply transfer to whoever is #1, you can give ACTUAL REWARDS for servers that do well. Like... literally EVERY RVR THAT WAS SEMI SUCCESFUL EVER. 
---
\-**Rebalance PPT / objectives / progression of objectives across a map** (this is reasonable for alpine and EB. T3 sm needs some nerfs. Desert needs redesign. / Siege (I admit I abuse completely OP guild golems to farm disgusting trash in their T3 keeps on a regular basis) / IS SUPPLY ACTUALLY RELEVANT SINCE HOT? OMEGALUL. 
---
\-**The worst alliance should be relegated** (DELETED FROM EXISTANCE) and a new alliance should take its place. This is required because it FORCES alliances to compete and be at least top XXXX (variable depending on population, can easily be adjusted without retardation like links). You FORCE alliances to compete (not necessarily to be the best, simply not to be the worst); because this makes them RECRUIT. As soon as I say you should give full server control to players, lots of playerslose their mind. However; by forcing the servers to not be the worst you force them to recruit, in order to increase their coverage and PPT (?!,! WvW is nUmBeRsGaEm ?!,!). By relegating the worst server, you ensure almost all players can find an alliance willing to take them AND provide a way to see who gets to run an alliance. Idc too much about how you decide "who" gets to run the new alliances that take the place of those relegated; but personally i'm a fan of bidding (gold). i.E. whoever pays most gets to run it. This leads to investment (you don't just make a huge investment to troll, especially if you have a chance of losing it if you can't compete with other alliances). Obviously most of these bids will be made by a group of players. 
---
Why is this needed to "fix" the issue of WvW. Well, giving rewards leads to farming rewards for the sake of rewards, and will always compete with people trying to PvP at whatever scale they enjoy. If instead you provide servers with stability and a common goal, you teach players to work together to reach this goal. It's almost like, oh shi it's literally the philosophy of PvE in this fucking game. 
---
Objectives serve a PURPOSE. IF you organise fights with roughly even groups, you go open field and have even fights. Between two random groups in a 24/7 gamemode, most of hte time ONE group is stronger. And as you rightly state - that group doesn't run out to get farmed repeatedly. 
---
In most RvR games, INCLUDING gw2 at release objectives serve to BALANCE two groups of different strength.  (this was lost due to the decay of WvW and literally balanced AWAY from for no sane reason). 
---
If the map was FLAT with NO OBJECTIVES - that's perfect for two evenly matched groups. But if one group is weaker, they will consistently and ALWAYS lose, hence stop playing. Instead you want OBJECTIVES where the attacker gains something if they succesfully attack; and the defender has a higher chance at winning. This provides both with a win condition. Further, you want these objectives to progressively get more difficult as you move into enemy territory (!!!!) This progression needs to be very gradual. THIS IS FUCKING IMPORTANT AND PART OF THE ORIGINAL DESIGN. 
---
It means that even if one group is stronger than the other group, they will take objectives until they get to an objective that is "too difficult to take". It naturally pushes both groups of INEQUAL strength towards an equilibrium because of objectives. And both groups benefit, as attackers gain PPT for being stronger. Defenders can still meaningfully play despite being the weaker group, and both get lootbags and kills. 
---
In gw2 we continuously buffed defending; while making every half decent group ragequit. This leads to nobody attacking UNLESS it's trivial to attack. Add the fact that there are no rewards, no reason to care and lots of bandwagoning and well... Clearly the entire PPT, matchmaking, pop balance AND coverage structure plain doesn't work. Because anet and most players don't grasp subtle differences between WvW and how most RvRs functioned. Which is weird to me, because a lot of these elements WERE part of WvW on release (they were just never finetuned appropriately).
---
I suppose you go the full length and pirate games as well, since you have no respect for the creative industries.
---
I guess the feeling is mutual.
---
since OP never said it directly and I'm not gonna bother clicking the link, gonna just assume they're referring to the dual attunement bug
---
what happens is the game seems to incorrectly track attunements in some cases and you end up with stuff like being attuned to Fire primary and Air secondary, but with 1245 as fire skills and 3 as the fire/air skill. subsequently you are unable to double attune to fire because even though it shows Air as your secondary, it's tracking it as Fire. this issue seems to happen most frequently in out of combat situations shortly (0.01-1.4s or so) following attunement swapping. this includes mounting, /gging, and previously when dying in general.
---
it's quickly remedied by attuning to anything else and back in and this bug only ever seems to happen out of combat. Given that pretty much all Weaver play is oriented around attunement swapping, there's not a whole lot to gain from abusing this bug, but you can, for example, play as a staff ele in WvW with Fire 1245 and Fire/Air or Fire/Earth 3 and just spam all of your bar aside from Burning Retreat. You'll be giving up a lot of utility (and even damage) by sitting in that attunement forever, but yeah.
---
i have never encountered a combat scenario where this bug "broke" gameplay, but if you need to carefully manage your starting attunements before indeterminate combat periods (such as wvw) it can be annoying if you're not mindful of the bug existing.
---
Nobody is pulling your balls, you wouldn't lose anything if you don't do them, compared to how worthless those achievements are nowadays even if you do.
---
You mean like every time you cast your defensive abilities or swap to water/earth on s/d or s/f?
---
You're a glass cannon. You will always have to sacrifice your maximum dps to avoid damage. That's how shit works.
---
/bug will not give any response, which makes people wrongly think it doesn't work anymore.
---
Hardcore/capped AP hunters already have these achievements and if they were adjusted, their accrued AP would get a nice bump as well. If anything, this opens up more avenues for AP gain. It also bears mention that AP hunters will have a significant reward for pursuing these collections and legendary crafters will have a significant AP reward for progress they make on their account (which is what AP systems exist for). It's a win-win.

But that's not the point of this graph.  The point is, if you're farming AP, the same or similar tasks that you used to do for 5-25 AP now only awards 1-3.

Guardian tanking is ridiculous actually. But it's not a chrono so no one wants it.

hi! awesome job! want to try this too. but do not know, what software to use. I have midi keyboard. Any advice for making it piano via PC?

perhaps; but not the ridiculous amount you sacrifice by not keeping enemies in your 6s aoe for more than 2s
---
I'm coming back after a year and half/two year break. What has changed? I played through PoF and have a griffon. What else is up for the game and story? 
---
(Also, in the sticked FAQ, the returning players part is sadly out of date. It talks about HoT.)
---
The last 11 Legendary weapons released didnt have any lore/quests tied to them in game, so I doubt they will give this one now.
---
It would also mean that Owners of HoT-only players wouldnt be able to craft it since season 4, where aurene dies, it tied to PoF.
---
In TERA, tanks have one of the hardest jobs because if you tank wrong then dps can take aggro and it can just wipe, the entire group depends on the tank and healer
---
Fake trinity game fake tank dead game
---
OK.  It's possible this is the best looking character I've ever seen in any game in all of my life.  Yes, I just said that.  I know it's a strong statement.  That's called a "heaviest" skin?

It’s usually much cheaper to buy them.

I have a hard time swallowing the "no holy trinity" pill.  I played WoW for so long.  ESO still had some real tanking, but nothing like what I learned on - my Protection Paladin.
---
You're a good for sharing that.
---
You will both be able to play the core game together.  Until you get Path of Fire, he will have access to more of the game than you will (namely, the path of fire maps).
---
FYI some F2P restrictions remain in place for ~5 days iirc after code activation.  This is mostly for sending mail/using the trading post.
---
I really hate how Wildstar killed a brilliant concept by focussing all of its efforts on a virtually extinct class of 'super hardcore' player. The world was phenomenal and the gameplay was equally good but the decisions made behind the scenes killed it several times over.
---
How about FA tempest?  That seems relatively straight-forward unless I'm missing something? (overload air all the time)
---
Live fast, leave a pretty corpse.
---
u-u That sonic from the top pic can't be real, i'm sure this is all a bad dream. Someone or multiple someone didn't look at that design and said "it looks good," and let it be published on the silver screen. We will all be waking soon... Right?
---
I like the way you think!  Instead of going down on their conjures can I just pick them up and waste them instead?
---
Yeah... but... there are clear aggro mechanics for many of the bosses, which can be exploited to control them by using a character who can survive the battle using skills and gear. So, a tank.
---
I think the "no tanks, no healers" began to dissolve in Heart of Thorns, but it's definitely not as bad as some games. I still think they've got it about right.
---
Jim Carrey approves this.
---
Well, supposedly they're going to overhaul the design before the movie releases.  Supposedly.  So we'll see.
---
I mean, all of season 4 has pretty much happened. We're waiting on the finale, which will be sometime this month
---
There's been a few new fractals (3, Twilight Oasis, Deepstone, Siren's Reef) and raid wings (2, Hall of chains and mythwright gambit), with another coming soon. We've also gotten a new mount (roller beetle, episode 3) along with some roller beetle race tracks, a new meta event (istan, episode 1) that's gone through some changes already, new world boss event (new shatterer, episode 4), some new gear types (diviners, plaguedoctor, etc.) and new weapon/armor skins that accompany collections. 
---
There's a new sPvP map called Djinn's Dominion, and Eternal Battlegrounds got an overhaul as well.
---
And in WvW, they introduced a new mount, the warclaw, which is still undergoing some balancing changes, but it allows for quicker map travel as it is.
---
There's also been a few big balance changes since then. Some of the big points were
---
Chronomancer: signet of inspiration change, extends boons instead of sharing them
---
Scrapper: gyros became wells, and scrapper became dominant in PvP
---
Druid: removing glyph of empowerment, replaced it with the previous elite skill, and gave them an entirely new elite skill
---
Berserker: berserk overhaul and burst skill overhaul, pDPS is reasonably viable now
---
And overall, the druid/chrono meta has shifted towards a firebrigade (firebrand/renegade)
---
Ya, there are a lot of once-daily things I like to do when I farm.
---
After 10,000 hours, I don't have much tolerance for repetitive farming unless I'm closing in on a goal. Daily istan run, HoT-metas when the timer lines up nicely, ascended crafting, parked alts. I find the routine relaxing and fun.
---
Gezz i knew it felt like it was getting worse but damn.... (those upticks we see are probably festivals). And some people wonder why after a while i stopped caring even thou i have stuff i can do.
---
I can't grasp the idea of being so focused on higher level of equipment equals higher skill. Does this mean every wow player is actually shit and is only getting carried by the stats he has? Is there no mechanical skill, boss knowledge, situational awareness needed to be a good WoW player?
---
That's the same for every traditional MMO
---
I dont know about pvp myself but im sure someone else will come and answer that part of your question. 
---
Super major, id say the beetle mount, the warclaw wvw mount and the upcoming skyscale(flying dragon mount) are all super awesome. 
---
A 5th season of living world will start after this upcoming final episode for season 4, then we can maybe expect an expansion, so its not coming right away. 
---
As far as I know thats about it for the game, though im sure someone else might consider more things to be major than me or vice-versa.
---
That's 2 different questions. Un-ided , it doesn't matter. Cause u get lvl 80 gear no matter what. For other bags, a bag opener still works the same.
---
I see goatse
---
I just tried doing that pose irl and you'd have to twist your upper body so much to one side to even get what's going on here. I can't even imagine how that stance wouldn't be awkward when holding weapons, ready to attack. lmfao
---
Meanwhile, I've built a tank *Weaver* (no, I do not do raids, but I would love to see if I can get it to work in one if I ever get the opportunity to raid at all) who looks like a stonemason and is almost permanently covered in lava.
---
I agree with this. There's also the fact that people love shitting on healers. Last time I jumped into fotm with 'friends' who would stand in aoe and bitch at me when they die.
---
with the face the frog-turtles makes, i think mario should be more worried for his behind
---
Hot damn. Time to save up
---
I tanked in gw2, wow, eso.
---
In all games you do way more than just standing there and using your taunt sometimes.
---
In all games tanking was very enjoyable for me. I guess it makes it 3/4 of top mmo's now?
---
Honestly, as long as you can shrug off enough damage you're probably fine. Chronotanking partly came about because almost all gear with concentration also came with toughness until Diviner's came out. The fact that they're good at it was really just luck, I think.
---
At least tell me you got to level 20 in pre-searing, since you spent so long there
---
That looks amazing!
---
Been under the influence b4?
---
Also, monsters spawning with other players around are stronger
---
Jajajaja
---
Most guides are still being changed due to the patch. The only real time Decimate Defenses is good now is if you aren't capped on crit chance (So things like open world).
---
you dont play Condi classes for fractal...
---
Honestly, some kind of cross-class elite would be really cool. 
---
It was a fundamental part of Guild Wars, so being able to do some epic quest to take on a new weapon and some cherry-picked skills adapted from another profession would be GREAT. 
---
Make it like Caladbolg where you can change, but it's expensive and you have to earn it in the first place and I think that's something that would go down really well as part of GW2's final expansion.
---
&gt; Ah yes, viper sword, the well known good open world build
---
its what i run on my pve weaver (i run celestial on my wvw weaver), i also run d/s (dagger atm, i kind of flipflop on which i prefer)+wh fresh air overload tempest in assassin/zerker mix and have little trouble with pve (outside of stuff like the mushroom queen HP or balth HP)... then i swap to staff on either of them and i have no options OR no damage
---
Use gw2efficiency. 
---
If you use their crafting calculator and enter your API, it will spit out a list of materials you have, a shopping list for what you need, and a step-by-step process of what to make. 
---
Your main decision will be whether you want to craft the precursor from the collection (it's pretty fun, but definitely time consuming. It's also not always cheaper to craft. I'm at work right now so I can't check, but gw2efficiency would have which way is cheaper listed for you), buy the precursor from the TP, or try and mystic toilet for the precursor.
---
Depending on how much money you have all 3 options are viable. Mystic Toilet gambling is the risky one. You could come out *way* ahead or *way* behind in money. The other two costs are pretty well set.
---
After that it's just follow the steps that it'll spit out : ).
---
Silverwastes/RIBA is still one of the best farms, yes. Fractal dailies are another pretty easy source of gold. 
---
If you can raid, raids are a nice source of gold as well. But I understand that's not feasible for everyone right off the bat.
---
Flax farming and iron/platinum node farming are another couple ways to get some quick gold in your downtime.
---
Best of luck! Bolt looks sweet : )
---
You should try Guardian or Necro
---
That is good to hear, hopefully a better design does come through.
---
you did as well as anyone could
---
Warhorn for a bard spec would be my vote. I don't know how it would work mechanically, but it sure would be cool.
---
It's funny because Crusaders are kinda squishy in D3.
---
not really, not in this game for example
---
I didn't say it didn't work. I said it wasn't acknowledged by the devs.
---
They go on sale every so often. I don't know if there's one right now. I'd say at least once a month or so, maybe once every other, they tend to come up.
---
go to  you tube and down vote it.... why are u all downvoting here sheesh
---
This is fucking sick. Talented artist. Are you comfortable saying how much you paid for this piece?

When I first saw this I assumed it was a mobile of Vlast, hung over the beds as a protective guardian talisman.

Nice video by Jawgeous tho.

Funny, I'm the opposite. ESO characters are so visually boring to me. I'll take the odd bright pink character if that's what it takes to get some armor variety.

I started playing in the summer of 2018 and I've already given up on my love of achievement hunting. There's so many that require group content that older players have already moved on from, large amounts of money, or are just impossible to get. 
---
I've let go of the hope of getting the high tier AP rewards, like the backpieces. It's simply impossible to ever hope to achieve that unless I spend every waking hour playing.
---
I think GW2 looks much better, but to each their own I guess.
---
I would like to ask you guys to actually go and watch the stream. Please stop slacking and waiting for dulfy's overview of the stream. Come to the stream engage in the discussion with devs and other players.
---
I think there should be a system where you pay extra transmutation charges, like 3 or 5, to set a skin from a diferent weight.
---
Didn't say it doesn't work, just that it's not optimal compared to power since condi takes time to ramp up, whereas power has burst making it ideal for short phases and trash mobs.
---
Djinn and spirit watch are the worst maps of their kind. I'm sure one day they'll be added to the map. I hope these get changed now.

https://i.imgur.com/W7vtzME.png If you can consider leather/fur looks "heavy" then swapping the chest piece on this one with something more covering would do it too.

Also the shoulder gear on "Other MMOs" image isn't nearly large enough to count.

Hmm. Imagine if it let you equip one track from any class as the final one. That would open up a huge world of options. Maybe associate each one with a set of utility skills or a weapon. That's be pretty cool

There are a lot of armors that do that and oftentimes it ruins their uses in Fashion Wars. The light asuran chest also does that.

---
At launch, yes. But with the introduction of HoT, raids, and elite specs, there is a lot more role structure than before. It's not as necessary as other games, but what would you call a chronotank other than tank? What would you call a druid other than a healer? Just because my weaver *has* skills that can heal my allies doesn't make me a healer, since my primary goal is to deal as much damage as possible.
---
The dragon animations look cool
---
Discussion with devs? Good joke :)
---
It's a completely insane build that, by rights, shouldn't work. Earth/Fire/Weaver, using sword/focus. Relies on evades from the sword moves, Obsidian Skin, barrier from rolling and constant heals from Signet of Restoration with the Written in Stone trait so it works even when it's off cooldown. Gear is either Dire or Trailblazer depending on how much I needed the expertise.
---
yea, I really wanna get my sunspear themed revenant poofier pants than the 2-3 options I have for heavy armor. :(

I’ve made Vivi from Final Fantasy - if that is the type of hat you want then I can show you it later. Don’t remember what the item was called at the moment!

I played City of Villains. That game made me realize why the holy MMO trinity is what it is.

Without the trinity, things turn into a giant clusterfuck.

I disagree that it will be easy as they are 2 different skins. They will need to make a new skin that looks like a mesh of the two.
---
I really want to give a try on a full minstrel guardian, my actual one is full harrier with trooper runes and it's already pretty good in open world.
---
Sadly, minstrel gear is a pain to craft, so i think i will probably get exo weapons and armors with wvw tracks since my guild took a break doing raids atm..
---
I absolutely would, but I’m at work. You know, like a lot of folks are.
---
How do you find players to play with? All my friends just went afk so soon that I’m not even sure I should get a friend into playing this...
---
Or they are just extremely experienced and I feel like being their friends is a waste of their time.
---
Lol
---
Yeah, it's not like they are gonna respond to criticism during a live stream.
---
Staff is fun for open world roaming, doing boss/bounty trains and stuff. It keeps you out of the cluster and thus keeps you alive.
---
And you've got some decent support healing abilities that you can toss into the cluster.
---
It's not so great for anything else. If you're soloing, Dagger/Dagger, Sword/Dagger seem a better choice.
---
It looks like we can just hover at the same place indefinitely. Its good, I don't like it when I blink and crash into a wall on griffon.
---
Almost every aggro mechanic I've seen is either random or based on toughness; that means you can build specifically to tank by bringing high levels of toughness gear. Chrono is the gold standard tank because they have so much access to distortion and evades and invulnerability, while also providing key boons (which they can do at the same time, thus minimizing party DPS lost to support).
---
Nightfall came out before EotN. At the time, the players had not been introduced to the Asura, the Norn, friendly Charr, Sylvari or really the concept of Elder Dragons. 
---
Nightfall could be bought as a standalone game and you could have the new player experience without ever touching Prophecies. Jeremy Soule was still doing the music.
---
This is not an argument though. Just a list of things that would make one feel different than the other.
---
Or ever. As always, they respond to fluff. These streams are part of marketing.

Looks like griffon is way faster on air.
---
[https://imgur.com/D505yTm](https://imgur.com/D505yTm) to all of you talking about the neck... you're welcome
---
It has a separate stamina bar from flying and gaining altitude but it gets used up very fast. If you want to get high up you got to use its wall climb functionallity
---
You just missed it in the gem store by like four days.
---
It will come around again though!
---
If I want to Support the creator I buy their Films/songs, but some things arent worth it
---
\*whittle
---
Amazing!
---
See, Dragon age makes me think of Thieves as bards.
---
did you make the 3d modell yourself?
---
I'm not impressed by this.
---
It flies what feels like slower than a griffon runs
---
It has a certain height it can gain which gets increased when you do the wall jump
---
The max height gain resets when you collect volitile magic orbs
---
Wall jump uses endurance (bond of vigor recharges it) and recharges max height gain by ~ 50%
---
Engage skill leaves a combo fire field
---
It replaces the springer when you want to get over a cliff that is too high for a single jump (+ bond of faith). The "hover" animation reminds me of WoW mounts. Is it physically possible for something to hover by flapping the wings so slow?
---
The problem with doing that is that base GW2 enemies are almost as easy in Marauder's as Berserker's, and HoT and PoF enemies will mostly murder you just as fast with 15k health as with 11k. Open world is almost always either "you die or you don't", no matter how tanky you are, so you might as well go berserker.
---
By discussion you mean comments like "wow" "so beautiful" "i love it" "so cute" "omg"?
---
japp.. and the tale from the land before Heropoints  .. that one is really spooky
---
&gt; EDIT: /u/Assic perhaps there is little discussion, because when you actually engage and ask questions about it, people just downvote you. shrug
---
I mean in this case it is probably downvoted because you are quite clearly making a comment without having basically any of the available facts.
---
it's
---
Hey, thanks a bunch!
---
&gt;  they buffed the springer
---
How? When?
---
You'll see in my first post I agreed with you, and advocated that OP role a dh.  
---
As for my argument being useless, I think if you reread my whole post you'll see that I put it in proper context, i.e. it is a true statement, but when pugging its useless.  However, not everyone pugs.
---
ohhh the mean mean devs don't want to interact with people who have nothing to do except bitch about their work &gt;:((( bad devs!!!!!
---
r/guildrecruitment
---
Oh, so it's not actually true flight? Well, that's a load of disappointment. I was expecting true flight at the cost of being the slowest horizontal travel speed.
---
Ahh.  Thanks. So maybe I was Ruins of Surmia once. And I think I changed to AR at some point bc Surmia wasn't very populäres Back then? It is starting to come Back, I think. Thanks.
---
For example, the springer was most likely designed as something to gain elevation first and foremost. The bunny design came after. Or the skimmer was designed as something that can traverse the sulphur in the desolation, and the appearance was added later.
---
The skyscale was just "hey lets make a dragon", instead of some physical obstacle/movement being considered first.
---
well if you dont like it, dont get it
---
[You should see what they equivalent used to look like in GW1.](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/3/37/Drinker.jpg)
---
The link to the illustration appears to just be a link to the video.
---
Thanks for this detailed info.
---
Tell me where you book a flight on these limitless helicopters that don't require refueling.
---
Better to just get good at avoiding damage in the first place. Then you can be an even better tank if you decide to be.
---
I;m not buying into this explanation. The movement mechanics are more complicated to design than skins. They had to have at least a concept of movement before making it into a dragon.
---
The same place you book the ones that can only go 50 yards before they have to land and take off again.
---
You are salty and I like it.
---
You can hang in the air infinitely, but when you move, you glide. Literally old news.
---
I do feel you but I at the same understand the challenges and balance issues they face when designing these mounts...
---
[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/NNQzByq) my ele. I used a similar set of skins on my mesmer a while back too.
---
Well that's literally what it means, whether you like it or not
---
Playing through Nightfall right now I think there's no comparison: GW2 does a way better job of presenting the environment, culture, and people than GW1 did. 
---
All the NPCs I'm meeting in 1 are very shallow and exist for the sole purpose of the script *or* are just NPCs there as vendors or generic guards. Granted this is pretty normal for older games because adding ambiance costs more time, money, and then processing power for the consumer, but even the text blurbs are pretty much short and generic. I haven't really found myself immersed or invested in the characters and story so far, though admittedly I generally don't care much for immersing myself and it takes a really solid game to draw me in (Bastion, Transistor, Witcher 3, Near All Tomatoes come to mind).
---
Seriously, though. Maybe it's because my character started in Cantha (Factions) and I missed what the tutorial is like in Nightfall, but nothing about these characters is resonating with me. Even Koss is just some memey dork that randomly starts dancing then does allegedly badass stuff off camera. Between the very rigid gameplay feel and the sometimes hilariously tropey script, I'm finding it hard to believe people thinking back so higjly on GW1 aren't obfuscated by nostalgia :V
---
It's most likely going to be mixed into the story or map exploration or achievements, therefore getting it is not a matter of sympathy but necessity.
---
&gt; I am concerned that the people of Anet don't get out enough.
---
Sound advice.
---
I know. I just don't buy into this explanation.
---
So it's just a slower griffon, then. I fail to see any situation where "hover in place but descend if you try to go anywhere" is actually useful over just using a faster mount
---
I am making a question without having the facts, hence asking the question.
---
I literally said: "Hi, I don't know X, anyone have any insight."
---
It looks cool, it's gonna sell more skins. That's it.
---
&gt;  white knights
---
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means
---
New player here, so forgive me if this is a stupid question. I'm doing a lot of quests, earning a lot of money, but it's not there? I haven't bought anything, but I only have 29 coins. What's going on?
---
I think they preconcepted a scenario where our character chases kralkatorrik in the final battle of the season but they didn't want to reuse griffon, especially that it's considered a "premium" mount by some.
---
Fixed! Thanks for catching that.
---
The only way to dismount in midair is the leap of faith, right? That’ll provide height, but not by that much altitude. Heck, for better altitude you’d be better with skyscale -&gt; leap of faith -&gt; skyscale again
---
You can't dismount mid-air.
---
Do people farm orr still?
---
I literally copied and pasted what he asked people not to bring up as it counters his opinion. 
---
My own opinion is that it brings nothing of value to the game, beyond people trying to cheese jumping puzzles or environment hazards. I think only agreeing statements with OP can be made here though, at their request.
---
That’s reasoning that could lead to exactly what I said.  Wanted a new mount for some motivation, so had to figure out mechanically how it would work.
---
credit card &gt; gems &gt; buy it from tp
---
this is the easiest way since 2012
---
29g is a decent amount of gold for a new player. It's around enough gold to gear you in a full set of Exotic armor when you hit level 80. What level are you?
---
You don't think they could think 'hey lets make a dragon' --&gt; 'what would differintiate it from other mounts?' --&gt; 'How about a flying mount that gains altitude'
---
I can think of a bunch of places I'd rather have Skyscale than Griffon, though. Basically any place I would have used a Springer for movement is going to be replaced by Skyscale *unless* bottom to top is the only movement I need and Springer happens to do it faster.
---
Griffon is great and all, but it is annoying to use for vertical ledge hopping due to the way jumping into slight bumps drops you like an anchor. Basically:
---
* Raptor for horizontal movement of medium distance without any medium/large vertical obstacles
---
* Springer for vertical movement of medium distance
---
* Skimmer for over water movement of any distance
---
* Jackal for... Sand Portals (*only niche I can think of is W5 if you have Bond of Vigor you can use this instead of a Griffon to reach Statues faster*)
---
* Griffon for horizontal aerial movement when you have a vertical drop to give you momentum and/or sufficient free vertical space, medium vertical movement on land with flattened surfaces
---
* Roller Beetle for horizontal movement of long distance without *any* vertical obstacles (*some leniency when you can convert a ledge into a jump to continue a path*)
---
* Skyscale for vertical movement of long distance with some horizontal aerial movement
---
They all have different purposes even though there's some overlap. Comparing the Skyscale to the Griffon sounds to me like trying to compare the Roller Beetle to the Raptor.
---
There's an awful lot of ways to avoid damage. Not all of them require you to be out of range of an attack.
---
Mastery 2 Rift Repair: **Following this episode's update, small rifts will appear throughout the world**. Hovering near these (with the mastery) will create a flight path marked by floating Volatile Magic. Flying through these VM nodes will replenish the skyscale's flight juice, thus allowing it to exceed the original flight canopy.
---
Do you think it will be a consequence of killing Kralk (magic inside him disperses in the world)?
---
&gt;Is it physically possible for something to hover by flapping the wings so slow?
---
Yea.with magic.
---
No, I think it was like this
---
make our character fight kralk on a mount &gt; let's not use griffon again &gt; k, we need new flying mount &gt; dragon &gt; movement decals
---
Hmm, I must be out of the loop. I don't get this one
---
I'm level 9. And I don't know if I need to clarify or not, but it's the bronze ones that are iffy.
---
Different strokes for different folks; I've always like it when it's fantasy but still "believable".
---
GW1 and early GW2 had this sort of style and have moved away from it.
---
I like how this subreddit is incapable of handing opinions.
---
I think it was like this
---
so the preconception it's going to be flying mount was first, the rest was a flavour
---
I liked that when the guy was showing off those rift things even he couldn’t show excitement about it. He knew that shit was dumb and boring lol. He even started to say you can do them daily and I think started to realize how dumb that sounded.
---
It has absolutely nothing to do with being identifiable in wvw.  With the way that the armor system was designed at the creation of the game engine, it is impossible to mix and match armor weights on the chest and pants.  More info here:

downvoting an opinion
---
It is not "impressing" but I think it is a really good thing that it doesn't make previous mounts obsolete. There is some situations where this new mount will shine, when your springer cant find a place to land between jumps for example.
---
I'm a fan of the theory that they began changing it after the design originally "leaked" and went ahead and released the trailer as-is to build buzz for when they inevitably announced they were changing it.
---
It probably won't happen and even if it does it will just be a band-aid that doesn't really solve the issues. Though the truth is nothing they can do will solve the issues, RvR is simply hopelessly flawed as a game mode. Which is why most of us no longer play it.
---
Oh you only have 19 copper? That does seem a little weird. Are you using the way points a lot? They can drain your money if you're not careful.
---
No plate mail but you can always go [medium armor.](https://gw2style.com/look.php?id=14638)
---
All I can read here is "waaaah, I want things to be like *I* imagine them and if they're not I'm acting up &amp; start insulting the devs". Stop being so salty. It was NEVER stated anywhere that the Skyscale was going to be able to fly indefinetely, neither did they say that it worked EXACTLY like a helicopter. They simply used helicopter as an understandable comparison - and it indeed goes up in the air for some height like a helicopter. It's also able to stay mid-air like a helicopter does. So the analogy is kinda fitting on a surface level. 
---
Also: unrestricted flight would probably break almost everything in this game + would make every other mount completely obsolete. So no thanks, we do not need it - if you want to fly forever SO badly, I suggest you play WoW.
---
And please let us have seperate head and face gear. My witch doctor necro looks stupid with luscious locks.
---
While a legendary is a great goal to have, the game is more about the journey than the destination, I would advise just playing through and resisting spending gold, it will naturally accumulate and do so quite well.
---
Another tip, just do very basic things to help gain more gold, use GW2 Efficiency to learn material farming routes to park alts on, do dailies/fractals every day, raids each week and pvp/wvw every now and then to change things up, they all give avenues for better gear without spending gold.
---
Another good way of gold accumulation is learning the trading post game, it can seem daunting and finding a niche in the market is tricky, but once you've found it money will roll in fast.
---
Do you feel better?  Please show me where I 'insulted the devs'.  You seem to feel that not expressing total love for anything anet does equates to 'acting up' and 'insulting to the devs'.  What they produced is not what a reasonable person would compare to the flight characteristics of a helicopter.  It doesn't have to fly indefinitely but we would not use them as much if their range was only 100 yards at a descending angle.
---
Tanks don't really take much damage in most fights to be honest. mitigation isn't the hugest issue.
---
100 yards is 91.44 meters
---
To me true flying absolutely destroys all forms of exploration. Fly over everything, no risk. Enemies? Just fly over them. Interesting terrain? Fly over it. 
---
It takes away all danger, and makes maps feel tiny. Even if it's slow, what's stopping you from ignoring all other mounts and just true fly over everything?
---
The closest you'll get is the fractal console in the guild hall. Unrestricted open world flight just won't happen.
---
You can tank with whatever you want. People have been using druids as tanks as far as back as the launch of raids. All that's required to tank almost any fight is that you can wear enough toughness to keep aggro without compromising your performance. Pretty much every support can do that.
---
Daily AP tops out anyway. You don't just endlessly get 10 AP for your dailies. It caps out.
---
Why would a small detail about the development of the mount be for marketing? How the fuck do you get invested in a mount because the dev team wanted to design the appearance first before the functionality? The dev only mentioned this as an offhand remark when they were asked about the appearance (20:50 for anyone interested)
---
I dunno. Ive had no issue grouping with randoms in open world and making friends. You just have to talk. Its not every time though.
---
If you are limited on playtime then fractals, (especially cm's + t4) are the most profitable. Do the regular dailies do fractals including recommended ones thats roughly 20-30g based on rng. If u have spare time remaining u can go farm silverwastes or HoT metas or new lw maps for volatile magic and buy t6 chests from the vendor with volatile magic icon. There are numerous ways to make gold but i usually just stick to these and they work nicely. Another big boost to gold comes from doing weekly raids if u can. A full clear translates into about 80-100g including selling the dropped and salvaged items. 
---
As for map completion it used to be thief/warrior as they could traverse long distances really quickly. Now with mounts it just doesnt matter what you play.
---
Never underestimate the nipple shields.
---
I'd say inclines are more common than sharp turns.
---
Inclines I run into a lot on say a Winterberry farm route. Raptor jump sucks up incline. Jackal does pretty well though. Between some bushes I'll use Raptor, and others I'll use Jackal. Roller Beetle for the last one of course.
---
For sharp corners...the only one that comes to mind off hand would be uh....I'm gonna say it's called Ruins of Holy Demetra? It's an iron node farm somewhere in Kryta, I think maybe Gendarren Fields or Harathi Hinterlands. Getting through there is hell on the Raptor, but easy on Jackal.
---
Many mount races I prefer Jackal as well for the same reason. Labyrinth race comes to mind.
---
Overall though, the Jackal is only a hair slower than the Raptor over a flat distance. If there's much of an incline in general I tend to use it instead.
---
Because marketing is about creating stories, to make people interested in a product, make it feel personal.
---
Bad skill at google pictures lol
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7ifTSkSeVk
---
It's called balance and not pissing off people who spent 250g on a griffon by giving a free mount with full flight.
---
go back to the wiki page and read the notes
---
I mean my reaper is doing alright for what we got.
---
not really sure what you mean
---
&gt; gw2 open world isnt really open so they ~~can implement this while still making it nothing special~~ can't implementing this without breaking maps even more than they are broken with current mounts
---
Thanks!, could you explain what's mean "under the canopy" I don't get it at all (sorry I'm not native england)
---
sure did! from head to toe
---
the griffon and the skyscale together make the best flying experience one could ask for in gw2 without technology imo
---
&gt; at the cost of speed
---
It takes a few minutes to do, but you can gain infinite altitude on a griffon already. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hFTopCEm-U).
---
since they are already broken due to other mounts, there's no reason to stop now, everything in this game is exploted anyway
---
It is the closest to a flying mount we can realistically get, and it's awesome, I don't get how you can be disappointed
---
Permaflight would be a can of worms when it comes to game mechanics, as GW2's maps are not prepared for that. We do not have seamless transitions between maps patched together to create the illusion of a single worldmap like many other games and mmos. 
---
And helicopters do NOT fly indefinitely. They run out of fuel, and when they do, they have to go down slowly, because the other option is a crash. Even if they run out of fuel, a helicopter manned by a trained pilot will slowly fall for a while because of autorotation.   
---
The skyscale runs out of fuel much faster, but maps are are much smaller than what they would actually be in real life.  
---
An in-game unit of distance that you can see in skills is the equivalent of an inch, and the world map we currently have is about 1/3 of the circumpherence of Tyria. If maps were 1:1, then the surface of Tyria would fit inside New York city. That's not possible, which means maps are not 1:1, but a compressed 'summary' of the actual worldmap, with empty space with nothing going on cut out.  
---
Based on the leaps humans can easily do, Tyria is likely just a bit smaller than Earth, so the g-force in Tyria is likely something between 8 and 9, so the distance of the map we currently have would be something like 12 000~13 000 kilometers. 
---
So it makes more sense to have a helicoper-like mount running out of fuel halfway a thin map, as it'll be the equivalent of about 2 hours and a half of flight that a normal private helicopter could fly without refueling, something like 500~550 kilometers.
---
Basically there is a max height above ground you can reach from the point you start flying, and that max height slowly descends as you move away from it.
---
insta record :D
---
Both.
---
Kiddies, 
---
Dyes were character bound along with armor and weapon skins. There was no wardrobe/dye system - if you wanted two Legendary sword skins on you had to craft another Legendary.
---
Its not a slight chance its a pretty high chance lol. Just buy it from an official seller.
---
I think they could make its head stationary during hovering, like most of birds that can hover. It's important for them to see properly. Even chickens have similar system while walking. 
---
Making its head move seems like it have big trouble staying in air, or maybe he is choking? Xd
---
Lol I was wondering if it was the same guy.

If we have had all the maps stitched together and dynamic chunk loading to simulate a single map like in many other games with a large open world map, maybe we could have had flight, but the current walled maps would not work that well with true flight.

I was absolutely obsessed with getting more kaboom out of my staff ele then. I was totally fine with MF set "leeches" 'cause enemies lasted longer to eat more of a stupidly buffed, broken meteor shower.
---
If you're slightly elevated and need to go a short distance, Raptor is excellent there also.
---
They said also that they cannot tell us more info about how its connected to the story, even obtaining it is a spoilery secret. 
---
Looks like it's really important for story to be a dragon and not wyvern or something else. So if this came first, then we know it should fly.

Now, they had to make it different than griffin. Done.

Not the consequence of killing Kralky per se but more like the consequence of our *attempt* with episode 5. There are already rifts with the current events. H
---
but it is a great way of letting everybody know you're a self-absorbed twat
---
that's such a pathetic and weird way of thinking, as if the be-all and end-all of everything this game is based on was money, and there wasn't actual value in just producing something for a public
---
Lots of works for little gain though. It's not like maps were generally extremely gated.
---
this game is a business and the very purpose of makin business is about money
---
The "flight bar" reminds me of Pharah's fuel bar in Overwatch.
---
The tall cliff they decided to ascend in the southwest section of the Desert Highlands is one of the type of areas I'm really excited to traverse using the Skyscale.
---
Also, I'd love if their choice to show the mount off in the Desert Highlands ends up being a small nod about the new map bordering this zone and Mount Maelstrom.
---
Aside from the fact that Invoker's isn't particularly good and hasn't been for a long while, actually the main damage output of Invoker's is 6 piece bonus which applies your thorns to your attacks. Due to the way D3 is designed (inifinite scaling) there's no real way of making tanky stuff there, most of survivability is based around CCs and crusader isn't particularly good on that front.

I am actually surprised by your post, you bring on this rant and then go on to say that to all the "white knights" about to downvote and say true flight would ruin the game don't bother to tell me so?
---
?????
---
So what? You expect to shout something to a room of people and don't expect ANY opposing views or arguments? That is not how it works right?
---
Bring sound arguments and maybe it will actually  be entertained in this subreddit, it is people like you which trigger simple downvotes and move on because 
---
1. You're not here to discuss, you're here to shout and rant.
---
2. If any counter argument is given, which obviously you would get more since unpopular opinion, you start calling them white knights
---
I think the only time I'd prefer the Jackal is when you need to make a bunch of short jumps as opposed to a long jump. Raptor can be kind of drain heavy even on little hops. I never had trouble with Raptor on my Winterberry route, but I know that it doesn't feel great on inclines so that's a good point.
---
You can also buy them, and any other bladed pieces, from VB merchants for 500 parts + 1g each. And I'm pretty sure you get a guaranteed drop from the VB t4 chest at the end of the night, though that requires organizing in advance.
---
Of course an individual developer has passions, ambitions, plans etc. We all do. But when official marketing like the stream in question happens, he is not representing himself but the company.
---
I don't understand how they can change him this late in production, it'll probably be some shitty airbrush job

Generally speaking there's no tank or a healer in GW2 PvE regardless, they are side-jobs at best. Dedicated full-on throughput healers are not needed, full-on tanks are not needed either.

I wonder how the game would shift if mesmer was nerfed  so badly it couldn't tank
---
Not *exclusively* Palawadan. The need of that led to a rise in "S4 Meta trains". They go around to all the S4 maps hitting the major events. They also seem to run pretty much constantly.
---
I personally prefer this as more content is being done, even if the gold output is slightly lower. More variety and more fun.
---
Dont rush and farm until you hate yourself and the game. Other folks have given good advice for how to get gold and items you need but imo alot of ppl are in a rush to get a leggy and end up hating themselves, the game, the process because they try to hurry along and it never comes fast enough for anyones liking. You will get there faster than you think with out farming yourself into oblivion.
---
The wiki has break downs of the materials need plus the links leading to 
---
 where/how to get them. On a slightly personal note i found writing things down helpful to keep things straight for what was needed for materials,crafting,events etc
---
Yeah, he also mentioned that bond of vigor pauses it's cooldown while latched onto the wall. And while flying, you descend gradually if you go up higher than your original maximum height.
---
Fractals is how i make golds in game.  
---
I usually down my dailies with pugs within 30 mins excluding CMs. By the time we finish last t1 rec, consumables have 1-2 mins ticking. So it's easier to see your performance. It's possible with full pugs but i usually run with at least 1-2 guildies. Make life more "bearable". Lol.  
---
Although with recs daily that including either deepstone, siren reef, shattered observatory or twilight oasis on t3 definitely take longer, can be up to 45-60 mins depend on pugs and instabilities. Something with outflanked, hamstrung, we bleed fire hurt, no doubt about that.  
---
We see what pugs we got and cover the rest of the roles to make sure we always have support. This is important. You can't go in full 5 dps and expect to yolo everything in minutes.  
---
I don't have a problem with sirens reef.  
---
Upon the very last boss, it creates a checkpoint. You should /gg so you can reset the group with full health and pre buff to get as ready as you can before bursting. It works wonder rather than you get swamped by the flood of mobs and die one by one. This is the only point I'd recommend all to gg, otherwise i don't like abusing it much unless i just somehow can't jump that day.  
---
For siren reef particularly, bring at least a condi quickbrand, 2 is even better for the pull and burning tick to ignore mob toughness and just melt them fast. If no condi quickbrand, grab an experienced scourge for both epidemic and barrier. These 2 classes i have to switch into when there's a siren reef daily. Should one shot fight on most pug groups.

Someone in other post wrote it quite well that with infinite flight you can just fly over everything. Over dangerous bosses, areas, and up till hard to reach places. This would just make the game even more easier than it already is and then just like your post here we would get 100 others saying that the new mount makes everything too easy and removes any challenge from the game.
---
I hate to break it down for you, but the Tank role in MMOs has exceeded "standing there and taking hits" about two decades ago.
---
You need the castle? Nope, wait like 3 weeks. Because objective at that time didnt rotate like now

I am within 800 points of getting to that radiant back, which will complete the set I wanted. I have been playing since launch and unfortunately did not recognize what achievements were for my first months of the game. So missed season one story that are no long available. Feeling robbed that you can go back to do any others but those are off the table. Ranked in the top 30 NA isn't what I was after although I achieved it. Just the back. Finally as I close in to getting it....considering time vs reward I made the choice during the roller beetle races to just say screw it. I could sit there and work on the muscle memory for a week and I'm sure I could get gold finally...at the cost of missing all of the other stuff I enjoy in the game...and it came to me. Am I enjoying this??? and I could honestly say that I wasn't. I'll still try for achievements, they are great goals, but spending full days to get the muscle memory down is, for me, insanity. It's not for everyone. I totally get that. Raids depend on it and some are driven by it. I'm finally to a place where I'm just doing what's fun and challenging and I'm not going to get them all anymore...and that is ok. This is my endgame I guess.

We didnt have wallet also.....that scare a me a lot

Holosmoth does a lot of damage, and as a holo, I've been able to beat both of them. However, you can easily kill yourself if you don't pay attention. It's a "high risk high reward" spec, and most don't like the risk.

She is close. Maybe.. soon.. she'll be ready to face the truth. That she is living inside a fictional reality. Let us hope that happens before *they* get to her.
---
But I was going to go with "Ralph"
---
i would've upvoted, but you're too trashy
---
Are you implying a great asuran genius is unable to build a flying golem mount?
---
twitch reactions, new low for gw2 "content creators"
---
hey everybody, I think we have a new LadySorshaa 👌
---
Can the gryphon gain altitude in an upstream like a glider?
---
If grimdark spikes get you going like that, you will go crazy over [Final](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/4/41/FFXIV_Dark_Knight.png/revision/latest?cb=20141109215223) [Fantasy](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/2/21/FFXIV_SB_Armor_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161016172342) [spikes](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/9/92/FFXIV_Ravana.png/revision/latest?cb=20141025171718).
---
someone on this sub mentioned this name to me before, sorry wrong number :)
---
I heard there are mysterious stories about some weird centaurs without a human torso. I heard in some regions of the world they ride on them.
---
We know the best tank is a Monk. Inna's is crazy OP for a zDPS.

Tanking in WoW prior to Wrath of the Lich King (ICC patch) went something like this. "Everyone use their disable abilities on the mobs, so we don't pull all of them or we wipe. Then, wait for the tank to pull and make sure everyone's full on mana. Then, wait 15 seconds for the tank to grab aggro, then burst them down. Then, wait another 10 seconds for the tank to grab aggro on the remaining mobs. Then, next pack."
---
Tanking in WoW now: "OMG OUR TANK IS SO SLOW NOT PULLING ENTIRE INSTANCE AT ONCE NOOB"
---
I know which I prefer.
---
Sounds useless to me.
---
I've always thought of it as the "gangly teenager" model, particularly given the mini is called ["Miniature Adolescent Aurene"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Adolescent_Aurene). Nobody looks great in the middle of their growth spurt.
---
Only it we can also adopt the title of Chonquistador.
---
Okay, thank you!
---
Oh this is great, thanks!
---
How similar is this mount compared to the Griffon? Don't have the Griffon yet and was wondering if I could save myself 250g.
---
My first 1k upvote :o
---
thank you lovely commanders &lt;3
---
I guess he get it from recent Alienware giveaway.
---
You’re right.  I hadn’t considered how utterly this would have destroyed exploration. Utterly. 
---
Also I’m this boring version won’t bite into springers use.
---
Chicken Chaser.
---
Professional Skritt
---
first world problems
---
mini infinarium mount inc
---
is this some weak attempt at sarcasm
---
Person who downvoted you obviously never defeated Sabetha.
---
I agree it feels a bit too griffon like in terms of the movement on the ground. They even said they based it on the griffon rig in the beginning iirc. 
---
Most of the mount animations in the game set them apart from each other a lot, so seeing that was kind of weird. Overall I enjoy the animations though, and I can't deny that they put a lot of passion into the chunky boi. 
---
I do find it funny how someone pointed that exact thing out when they first released the trailer for the skyscale and while it was a bit too extensive imo, they were right about it and people dismissed it as them judging too early.
---
You’re right, it’s my fault they compared this with a helicopter without reservations. 
---
TL;DR This is their fault.
---
Yeah, same here.
---
no, but you can dismount from the gryphon, glide into an updraft, and then mount the gryphon again to achieve the same result.
---
Skyscale -&gt; Faith -&gt; Griffon = Zoomies
---
impressive!
---
Another thing would be to create an alt for yourself.
---
It is a lot less noble than your primary idea, but the login rewards themselves are a reason for a lot of people to have one or multiple alts.
---
Otherwise, what u/PM_ME_ANYTHING_WEIRD is a good idea.
---
Even the metric system is trying to short change us.
---
How can I change your mind? :(
---
when you **create** something you are content creator
---
My left fingers can now do things my right fingers can't. And I'm right handed
---
Ya, normally you can salvage or sell old gear but some stuff you get for free from leveling or for karma has to just be deleted or sometimes forged into a new item that you can then salvage. Early on and with low level/rarity items I really wouldn't worry about it, try to salvage or sell first but if that doesn't work it's not really worth holding on to.
---
Then please tell me what a mount has to do with practicing special privilege for women.
---
Nice find :)
---
Just need to pickpocket that sleeping person.
---
You’re right. I’m an ungrateful monster. I should be happy with the altitude I’m given.
---
Nothing was **created** it was an uploaded livestream, to help people that want to learn about the new mount.
---
At the most I guess you could say, the OS **created** the file.  But that isn't us creating, if you want to go that route. The OS **created** the file.
---
Flying mounts killed wow for me and I slowly hated and stopped playing wow when cataclysm changed old wow maps and I hope it never happens for gw2 sry OP
---
That's actually the reason I stopped playing a looong time ago...
---
I want to choose a class and play it like it's supposed to, not playing a ranger which is in fact a healer with an axe and a horn and getting sniped by a Guardian with a longbow..
---
I still remember getting kicked since I was playing a ranger with a longbow instead of a greatsword
---
It creates a shortcut on your desktop for you that launches the updater, then gw2 right after?
---
No dude, you changed my mind with your powerful words.
---
A chair's a chair!
---
Got it from the Alienware giveaway.   [https://na.alienwarearena.com/](https://na.alienwarearena.com/)
---
Anyway this is a good idea I will try this later.
---
There are some restrictions:

I did pretty much the same, left around July 2013 during season 1 after cutthroat politics started (I think I came back for a little bit in September for SAB) then came back around the start of season 3 in July 2016 after friends convinced me to play again.
---
You could give it to the r/GuildWars2 mods, and they can do some kind of raffle giveaway.
---
Great. Mounts are great. Now where is the actual content?
---
I mean the idea of this system wasn't bad, but it meant either throw hundreds of gold at the NPC or do world map completion on all your characters.
---
Not all opinions are created equal.
---
&gt; what else to expect from someone excited about Twitch reactions top kek 
---
What else to expect from someone that whines like you? Nothing at all :D but have a good day :)
---
You mean the tried to nerf FGS. They tried to fix the wall bug over and over again but it always came back. After years they found a solution.
---
I would say it's not incredibly similar, but  could fill the same utility aside from speed. Like, if you wanted to quickly traverse a gap that is somewhat long and high, the skyscale would be able to do that as well as the griffon, but if you wanted to traverse a huge horizontal distance the air, the griffon is still the only way to do that.
---
You considered me worthy enough to engage into conversation so dont pretend that you dont care now :)
---
Not sure why some people want to downvote ArenaNet's guide for the new Skyscale mount.  But it's alright, to each their own.
---
The made the charge about twice as fast.
---
Aurene have Griffon's skeleton model so no surprise. Skyscale and Warclaw are also based on Griffon.
---
Did they specify the release date of the episode?
---
I would've liked to hear the description of Skyscale to be a mountain climber instead of helicopter so I set my expectation lower as it would be a much more accurate description. When I think Helicopter, I think about the freedom of flying but slow. I don't think about helicopter using their feet to jump on rocks so that it can stay up in flight.
