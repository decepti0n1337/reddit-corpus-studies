WTF are you talking about? I was replying to a comment about FF, nothing to do with GW2. The poster deleted comment now though.
---
---
---
I seriously doubt we'll see Cantha so long as the Chinese servers exist.
---
back in the day those were even champions. shame that most of them got nerfed into 111 bosses.
---
Maybe just barely...
---
Sorry I'm out... It's NCSoft what do you expect?  It's not like they have a reputation for shutting down games that don't hit expectations.
---

---
Maybe they should look into the mobile market like Blizzard.  Don't you all have phones?

I'm not spending a single penny on GW2 anymore nor waste my time waiting for more content until I see a bright future for this game.
---
nail in the coffin. time to pack it up boys. what are some other good raid games out there? (NOT WOW)
---
Yeah, its pretty bad here in the states when it comes to job security, especially in the gaming industry right now.  Unfortunately it appears to be heading to a breaking point and all the warnings from consumers seems to be falling on deaf ears.
---
It takes less dev's to work on mobile projects :P
---
Again, it was a response to comment about FF, not GW2.
---
Wiki was updated earlier today;  apparently she's been gone for a while. ...
---
&gt;Folks are going to whip yourselves into a frenzy. 
---
&gt;are going to
---
You mean they aren't already?
---
Oh, this hurts...
---
To bad we couldn't do some sort of gofund me for anet ):
---
They are wrongly voting with their wallets.
---
They are supposed to NOT buy gems until Anet is completely transparent with the playerbase.
---
But no, these people decide to keep supporting someone who has kept us in the dark for a year now, and is planning to continue to.
---
8k hours over six years. I'd have left the game much sooner if not for the community and circle of friends I have found here. The game helped me cope with loss 5 years ago, now it helps to let my steam off after I come back from college.

Farewell!

This guy is responsible for a lot of the badass things in GW2.  His art style is so great and he did a ton of great work.  If you don’t follow him on social media, you should.  Very talented guy with lots of great insight into what he does.
---
Finally some sense. The kneejerkers are going to be the ones that kill off the game at this rate. 
---
Seriously, game companies need to work hard to find veteran talent like this and they’re just kicking them to the curb. This is literally my them blowing both feet right off.
---
It is indeed. Thank you for everything you did for the game, and I wish you the best of luck finding somewhere new. &lt;3
---
&gt; we should at least give ArenaNet a few weeks to kinda restructure
---
Fair, but they shouldn't do it **this** close to a release. Just hurts the people's desire to play.
---
Sigh... not Gaile Gray yet again. May she be forever remembered for the froggy joy she spread around Kamadan. Seriously, one of my favorite time spent in Kamadan was just chatting with Gaile back in the day.
---
Given how the announcements were worded, and how much mismatch there was between that and today's layoffs, I'm not convinced I know what "just the publishing division" means.
---
Not enough to be confident ANet will always remain ANet.
---
:omegaLUL:
---
My phone doesn't wanna load the page.
---
Can anyone tell me if they're also postponing WXP week ? 
---
I don't play GW2 much either but seeing her go made me genuinely sad eventho I don't even know the person. I too remember the posts on gwguru and if I remember correctly she sometimes popped up in-game to chat. Out of all these lay off news, I think hers hurts me the most. I wish her all the best.
---
One of the reasons i'm quitting GW2 if the ship is really sinking, is because i adore this game, and i can't see it fall. I'd rather leave the game and pretend it's still alive and KICKING, instead of playing it, getting no updates, no expansions, no communication, and getting frustrated that the game i adore is quickly dying.
---
They still have 300 devs on the game. THings may be shaky for a while but the game is far from dead.
---
I won't be surprised if we don't get any more wings after 7.
---
Raids without easy mode were never viable.
---
What a day, I read an article on Massivelyop and it looks like a who is who list, seems like they layed off any one with over a decade of experience probably based off salary.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong though but Josh resigned though correct?
---
Well, at least they'll be able to wrap up the story. Probably fairly rushed but it's better than nothing.
---
I do it if I had a particularly nice conversation with someone and change their nickname so I remember. And also to follow wvw commanders I like running with. It's just a convenience.
---
I did, but I doubt they look at continuity errors in vanilla content. I've reported hundreds of typos back in beta that I haven't seen fixed to this day. I've also noticed they don't have a specific bug report category for personal story pre-living-world so that may be a factor.
---
Gaile got let go? Man, I don't know what to make of it... Got a wave of nostalgia seeing these screenhots of her Ranger in Kaineng and old LA. 
---
Wishing all those affected the best.
---
She stepped back from being the active voice for a while, managing more in the background, then came back.
---
F
---
I'm really sad about the devs, but Im majorly concerned about the content that they were also leading for. Will ArenaNet address all our concerns about major content devs for Fractals and Raids leaving? Will Living Story even be sustained? 
---
I'm losing my mind really. Thinking that there won't be anything after Wing 7 just makes me feel awful.
---
To be fair core thief is literally one of the best thief builds for roaming.  Obviously you don't bring it to a squad but for havoc and solo roam it's better than d/p and more solid than deadeye cheese.
---
We're never going to get Coalescence, are we?
---
Is there a patch or not today?
---
I started playing GW1 in 2007 around Christmas, I was 12 at the time. I met my husband through this game and married him in 2017.  Some of our guild was in attendance at our wedding. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**GW1:** 
---
**Account 1 : 3032 Hours**
---
**Account 2 : 3262 Hours**
---
8 characters on each account.
---
**Total: 6294 Hours**
---
**GW2:  6742 Hours**  
---
I have 36 characters at this point. 
---
**Grand Total: 13036 Hours**
---
or: approx. **1.49 Years of my life.**
---
It's the danger of any online game. Eventually they wither away or shrink to a few thousand niche players.
---
Damn Lena as well? She just came back! (and already did a couple of amazing tracks)
---
They were the unseen heroes man, those background noises were very immersive, made exploration feel that much deeper.
---
Only going off memory, so it will likely be butchered, but Jennifer Schrule?
---
I guess they are more than employees for him. Of course some of them are also friends.
---
Yeah, people who claim stupidity like what you quoted have no clue how companies work. Restrusturing and lay offs never bring good things.
---
It also helps if you're looking up class guides and train your personal rotation, read your skills and think with that brain of yours.
---
Often times I see Guardians or Mesmer dieing in projectile heavy bossfights to the same mechanic everytime... Your class has like 4 different reflection skills/abilities but those types of players usually dont know their own toolkit.
---
Look at the boss, what is he doing? Does he shoot stuff at players take reflection, does your team get knocked around by adds or stunned by the boss take stability.
---
I train new players and its weird what personal lack of skill you usually see in t1-3.
---
**Know your class, read a guide, hover your mouse over your skills and think!**
---
I'd rather the game stay with NCSoft than have anything to do with Amazon.
---
Wildst... oh :(
---
But this subreddit said the only people leaving where not even on GW2... 
---
IDK if CU, AOS, etc all fail I'm not sure if MMOs will be around for much longer, GW2 included.
---
/salute
---
Sorry but I'm done after all this.  I know when to read the writing on the wall.  Fuck NCSoft.
---
4476h 5m gw2 + 3000+ gw1
---
Out of all the layoffs this is one of the worst imo, ArenaNet barely bring the community into anything anymore, Gaile has always played a big part of community even so with GW1.
---
Sad to hear the news,  I hope she still remains part of the community.
---
Thanks for the insight. Damn, people can be so shortsighted.
---
Fully understand that, and do appreciate you for caring. Really do. But it all just reads like.... a bit much. Like the situation isn't. It ain't that deep. Like I know it's other people panicking but.... never mind.
---
I will not push the situation any further then needs be. 
---
Exactly, I won't decide if this game is worth my money/time until I see ArenaNet and NCSOFT has decided the same.
---
If people are panicking, it's because we don't know what's truly happening, because ArenaNet is terrible at communication. Moments like this show why strong communication procedures are important.
---
I'm really scared for gw2. Like REALLY SCARED.
---
No one said all projects but gw2 have been cancelled. 
---
15,540 hours 9 minutes over the past 2,375 days.
---
(I took about a 9 month break from the game in early days--regret it terribly, missed out on most of Living World Season 1. :( )
---
&gt; People nowadays are just too scared to try and fail. They want instant results without much effort and for certain type of content it's just not possible with such mentality. 
---
It's an age of cash shop microtransactions (Pay for progress) and casual gameplay. I mean it's even a common trend in games these days to have "Aim-assist" and in mobile games, many even have "Auto-play" options in a variety of games.   
---
The population of those who believe that this shouldn't be the case is diminishing. As much as the community likes to deny it, it's true, there are many more people these days who simply do not want to work for reward nor even try to improve. This surely isn't all people, but to deny that it doesn't exist or that isn't prevalent is just delusional. These people expect best rewards to just flow in from pressing 1111111111111111111111111, which is basically what 95% of people do in all metas and world bosses.   
---
Now I think that there is a place for these people too, open world content is just that. However, I think that if you could increase difficulty of open world, not just by damage like HoT. We know how that one ended. But recently for bounties they have added mechanics which is a good thing, but it doesn't matter in a 50 man zerg since everyone just presses 1 anyway. This way, no one learns anything regardless of what is in open world. The problem with this is that there isn't really a bridge from open world -&gt; end fractals/raids.  
---
As for fractals, T1 and T2 is still a 11111 spam. 
---
I think their bridging of content sucks. They could even introduce WvW through open world. Silverwastes is an example. Except again, there is only little crossover there. They could make a map that's  a merge of Silverwastes and Dragonstand. Not an instanced map but holding forts which when you do, eventually leads to a meta event and boss at the end. Introduce the supply system and supply camps where you can buy siege for map currency to siege forts to claim as your own. Put a super rare infusion drop and amalgamated gemstone at the end of the meta chest. Done, repeatable event that teaches new mechanics of another gamemode. You could even have a boss that teaches a fractal mechanic, like Arkk, where the whole group has to push 4 orbs into four pillars in some asuran themed fort or everyone in the fort instantly is defeated, then that way, they can't just skip mechanics by swarming and pressing 11111.   
---
I dunno welp.
---
FF:XIV for sure. Expect the gear treadmill going in. And set for a new expansion release in the summer. Slower gameplay rotation wise, have to deal the global cooldowns. But very solid game if you don't mind the monthly subscription
---
So not all that smart, especially since you're ignoring the actual point of my comment.
---
It's not dead (they have 300 devs still there) but some of the departures are very saddening.
---
GW1 had a Chinese community and Factions existed so I fail to see the relevance. 
---
Yeah but the hope was that core gw2 staff that were pulled off for other projects would be returned to actively work on gw2 rather than just being let go. This shows that's clearly not the case and makes the future of gw2 look kind of bleak.
---
They've been hinting at this since 2013 :O
---
Thank you for having been with us for such a long journey. To many people, me included, you were an intrinsic part of GW2 and you will NOT be forgotten.
---
because they always kick off the high payed devs first
---

---

---
I can see where you're coming from: This *can* help refocussing the company back to mainly supporting the one project that we on this subreddit care the most for. And a grain of optimism to see a silver lining in this situation helps keeping you sane. And trust me this silver lining *does* exist.
---
**Still:** The current situation is **not good.** This is a drastic step. The errors in the past that made this a necessity run deep and **a lot** of talent is walking out of AreneNets door today, likely never to return there. 
---
Well veteran devs are more likely to get new jobs in the field with more years of experience.  So I can see them taking a severance package and let the younger devs stay on, since they will likely have a harder time finding a new job.
---
This. I love GW2 but seriously, what worth does the new content even have? The issue I think is that GW2's progression system is such a big mess and all over the place that new content isn't even worth it most of the time.
---
Yes it's fun exploring new maps and seeing new events, but you can do that in 1-2 hrs... Why should I bother going to Thunderhead Keep? The best gear in the game (which is the main incentive of progression) is unrelated to new content and comes form crafting instead.
---
There's literally no point revisiting any of the maps from LW4 except for collecting resources (not actually content or gameplay).
---
There needs to be some sort of restructuring of the progression system moving forward so that playing new content, new maps etc... Is actually worth it. 
---
Well the problem people had with Blue Mage was that it wasn't overpowered enough, and that it wasn't actually a real job, just some side thing.
---
I was mostly referring to player numbers though.  Both games have seen a lot of growth over the past few years. FFXIV is actually adding 2 new data centers to deal with increased player load before the next expansion. Both are getting new expansions around the same time too which is great.
---
I volunteer.  Need the billion first though. 
---
She was supposed to be the leader of the 4th Mouth of Mordremoth lane (which was scrapped) as well as the plot on how the Nightmare Court actually reacted and interacted with ol' Mordymoth.
---
I've dumped a generous amount of cash in gem store and I only started playing 4 months ago. I've never gotten the impression this game is dead. It's very active. People are constantly doing world bosses, meta events and bounty trains. I play during off peak hours but even then there's more out and about. I have an easier time finding people to do things with here then in ESO even.
---
Enough man, seriously.  You'r all over the place grinding your ax.  Grow up.
---
&gt; I am taking the fact that this was not announced this time around and the fact that they literally have said we are going in to a new living world season after this one to mean it's not going to be an expansion. If an expansion was coming they would have said an expansion was coming, not a new living world season.
---
There is a massive difference between "there isn't an expansion coming next" and "there is no expansion". And don't try to bullshit into saying there isn't a difference.
---
You've got loads of stuff to do in the xpacs, whatever happens to the game in the long run.
---
The only one I still never recognise is Matt, which is kind of a testament to his talent.
---
:( 
---
Torches up my friend
---
The game is heading towards EOL, with no expansion coming and only living story episodes once every few months it's just gonna get worse from here. The game was already running with a tiny team now with raid and fractal devs gone its just gonna be even worse.
---
You just gotta wake up and smell the coffee buddeh
---
If this is the state of the industry, we NEED the bubble to burst. We need to reset this whole fucked up industry so that it can be about making good games again instead of making perpetual, exponential money printers.
---
I see you are in the bargaining step already..
---
It absolutely is at max level. Way more than WoW is. Play Bard, I've yet to find a better-designed DPS class in any MMO, and it's very fast-paced.
---
&gt; Their sub seems to be peeved at Blue Mage inclusion pretty badly as its waaaay OP objectively over the other classes.
---
Blue Mage can only be used when soloing/open world and doesn't go up to the max level atm. Haven't heard anyone complaining about it being 'OP' personally but I'll admit that's just anecdotal.
---
New expac coming later this year and even on the low pop servers I see plenty of people running around everywhere. FFXIV is in a pretty good place right now.
---
Chests disappear after a little while but normally the entire group will loot VW, then head east to the champs, kill them all then start a chest farm. You shouldn't be doing chest farm until after VW imo.
---
I know. It just didn't sit well with me that is becoming an industry standard to put hundreds of people out of jobs without notice. Despite "record profits". Telling their investors one thing while telling the employees another and PR spinning a completely different one. 
---
This!! Often voulentry redundancy comes with a payoff package. The longer you've served usually the better it is. I used to work with someone who had been with the company 15 years and they got nearly 2 years worth of pay when they took voulentry redundancy. She was stoked because she was coming up to retirement anyway so she got early retirement with a huge handshake. 
---
Some of the comments on today's threads lead me to believe we have a lot of people on this sub who have never worked and certainly never been through a company going through redundancys
---
A damn, i was a fan of his grills.
---
Oh shit, this hurts. Fractals are pretty much my main content in GW2.
---
I'm grateful to Ben for his passion and communication, and wish him the best for future endeavours.
---
yo i am gonna buy some gems tonight. i like this game no matter what, and i never had complaint. 
---
just not understanding some people who try to act smart saying not to spend more on a game in dark, and saying the game didn't do anything to them but they are on this subreddit. 
---
you may say i m dumb that small money won't help, but gofundme has projects very small but funded bit by bit, and if the game isn't doing any good to me, i won't be on this subreddit!
---
Yes for advertising reasons. Your average gamer understands pvp. Only eve online players really get what wvw is. They arnt going to care about current players its going to be big corporate get new players and new money into the ecosystem while slashing operating costs as much as possible. 
---
&gt; tHERE'S nO sUCH tHING aS eMPATHY iT'S aLL jUST vIRTUE sIGNALLING

---
Where am I wrong with that statement above? Discuss.
---
Why would you assume that being concerned about the future of the game automatically means you don't care about the people who lost their jobs? Why do you think it's impossible to care about both? 
---
I think the majority of people on this sub are very well aware that NCSoft is doing a lot of people dirty here. Not only have some people lost their jobs, but those who are still employed are being *directly* affected by the fear and uncertainty that NCSoft's handling of this whole fiasco is causing in the playerbase. Surprise layoffs with no regard for what they might be disrupting in terms of game plans (the Warclaw, probably the balance patch), cancelling an anticipated livestream hours after it was supposed to go live (clearly the layoffs were part of the reason that this unfortunate situation happened, so I squarely blame NCSoft), and other shenanigans are making players very scared and uncertain, which in turn probably makes the remaining employees very nervous about the long-term stability of their own jobs.
---
Most people here understand all this, and are capable of being afraid for *everyone* involved, not just ourselves.
---
&gt; Guild Wars 2 at the moment is among the top 3 MMORPG games
---
Based on what? Revenue? Player count? Subjective quality?
---
&gt; [Supporting GW2] is how more people will join the game.
---
Unless they Realm Reborn the game, no significant amount of people will want to play a game on maintenance mode. 
---
The new generation of kids prefers dumbed down games like Apex legends or fortnite.
---
There's nobody left to nerf it RIP
---
Hardly true. You can check the earnings reports posted on this sub and see most of their other games are reported as doing OK or better than expected while gw2 consistently underperformed. Don't try to spin the story
---
I'm not even waiting that long. Weekday nights rarely go much higher than 2 for me (NA)
---
yeah esp. pc games industry are doesnt look that well atm, many are jumping on mobile now since you can abuse people much easierwith monetisation there
---
Goodbye to the heart and soul of gw2. Hello corporate cash grab husk.
---
I'm actually mocking you on purpose as I already know your line of argumentation you're going to spawn here, therefore not wasting my time on reading same stuff I've already seen today :)
---
The combat isn't anything like GW2 at all and is much more boring to play (imo).
---
I suspect you've hit the nail on the head.
---
I’d say its cleaving capabitilies are right around average. Better than dagger/dagger for sure, and decent enough for small groups of mobs, but less than holo, dh, weaver.
---
Honestly, even with NCsoft forcing Arena Net to focus on GW2 completely, I don't really see any silver lining. The long term plan for GW2 was basically a quasi-maintenance mode, so even with the company being refocused, they need to re-evaluate everything they're doing. If they decide to do something meaningful instead of a skeleton crew LS season we still won't see it for years. 
---
And whatever they do decide to lose is going to be missing  the All Star devs they had. Shit is just fucking bleak all around. 
---
This is business. Business doesn't treat players as people. Players are the live-stock that brings money. NCSoft does not deserve even the single bit of sympathy from players. They don't deliver? No money for them. Period.
---
Man it's so sad when so many devs leave :(
---
Them GCDs though ... :( do you just get used to it?
---
Maybe he didn't want to return to gw2. Maybe he wanted to do something new.
---
4 out of 6 on the web team, actually.  Source: I was one of them. :(
---
Because it uses the Twitter method, not the Facebook method.
---
You won't really be friends unless you add each other. Otherwise they are just "followers".
---
They requested the layoffs? NCsoft literally decided to lay off 100 ANet employees.
---
You didnt present any yourself. Your tirades are just personal innuendos towards me covered with thick sauce of moral superiority you believe you have :)
---
gw2 crappe dout a long time ago. its dead
---
/cry
---
You're right. This is unprofessional.
---
May this change be the precursor to your legendary journey ahead. 
---
My argument is you shouldn't criticize people on a thread about them being fired. Maybe you'll learn to read when your big brain manages to figure out English that doesn't come out of a thesaurus
---
But thats anets fault. They didnt deliver the releases of their background projects since 2013. Ncsoft was already generous keeping them alive for so long without results
---
The GCD seems long, however that's not taking into account that most classes have a metric fuckload of offGCD abilities they can (and should) weave between GCDs (not to mention things like movement, FFXIV is a VERY telegraph/dont-stand-in-bad-heavy game, with raids eventually becoming something along to an elaborate fatal dance)
---
I had hopes that Anet had projects in the works beyond the GW ip because they do a great job and to see them work on new stuff would be amazing.  But now all that's left is uncertainty for me for Anet and if I'll have to move onto other mmos now too.  
---
Why not. I believe at least one of them deserved it long ago. Again attacking me with fake morality :)
---
Interestingly, if a large portion of people did this, it hurts the game more, but I digress, not much we can do and its giving me the game go byebye jitters. Id assume game is ok for a little while.
---
When Colin Johanson left I just knew something was up. So this doesn't come as a surprise to me, really. I was, however, thinking of upgrading my computer at a great expensive - literally only to play GW2 faster, with better detail etc. but with all these layoffs, and the future of GW2 kind of up in the air, I think I'll just save my money and not upgrade my computer.
---
/salute 💔
---
Can someone link the tweet? I get a "you are rate limited" message when I click the thread. I hope this is true, we need some good news.
---
I'm extremely out of the loop and I haven't played GW2 for 1 year. Can anyone explain to me what is going on and why I see so many developers leaving the company?
---
It's very sad. As much as I like to complain, at the end of the day, I love this game and company, and the news of ArenaNet layoffs is one of the most upsetting things I've read that felt so personal to me. Guild Wars has been part of my life for over a decade, and very much a part of my life both growing up and today.
---
What I'm trying to get at here is... even with us critics, at the end of the day, we love this game very much.
---
I hope NCSoft finds it in their heart to respect this series that has brought so many of us together.
---
They *can* be, but this is NCsoft. Those have never been good signs with NCsoft.
---
I wonder why people like you make definitive sounding statements when you clearly haven't done any research whatsoever. Then again, I guess you're the average redditor. Anyway, *eBay* v. *Newmark* does mean for-profit corporations have a legal responsibility to maximize profit.
---
I'm officially scared.
---
Still working on the mobile side things here, but I hear ya.
---
Players tried that with City of Heroes.  NCSoft refused.
---
As far as I'm aware, most asian communities aren't a fan of Cantha on account of it not being explicitly their culture, rather a blend of many asian cultures.
---
"Why not" lol
---
**C U R S E D**
---
Damn, This is just a bloodbath.
---
I hope Arenanet doesn’t get pushed into the mobile market...
---
Yeah, NCsoft is a business. And that's why they suck, no soul, only corporate bullshit that leads to stuff like these. I know it's logical to end production of project that isn't working, but as a player, and someone that just witnessed 100 people lose their jobs with barely a notice, I still say, FUCK YOU NCSOFT.
---
Not Jesus... Satan.
---
You do, but most classes have a plethora of things to track and off-GCDs to press. Some classes even have a lower baseline GCD, and Skill/Spell speed reduces GCD a bit. My samurai, monk, and ninja easily go below 2 seconds at all times, and still have a bunch of buttons to weave between those GCDs while watching mechanics (of which there are more of than GW2 raids).
---
Case in point, thank you :)
---
Gaile Gray is the face of Guild Wars in my eyes, im so sad right now :(
---
Please. I'm so fucking mad at them. 
---
I saw that group in TD at the central WP, I was amazed and screenshoted it multiple times ^^
---
I like a lot of what ANet has done thus far, but man if someone was working for me and they disappointed with the frequency that ANet does I'd consider replacing them too.
---
Anet is the same business. Good wishes and cupcakes dont make success
---
That is correct.
---
There are a lot of people in GW2 who are still inexperienced and naive about the real world work environments and politics.
---
I'm young myself, but I've experienced, spoken to, and learned enough about the business world to know this kind of lay off is extremely common...especially in development and project based industries, though not always this abrupt - which leads me to believe that NCSoft had their eyes on the numbers and project progresses for quite some time now, and the results they saw during progress presentations did not revitalize their confidence in their success; this this being the end result.
---
It's like a Centaur but with no torso, less ugly, and tastier.
---
I never liked her either, but regardless of how I personally feel towards any devs, I feel sorry for all those losing their jobs. It's never easy to try and find work again in a short period of time before going backwards financially. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
---
ANet cares anout thier own projects and IPs, obviously NCsoft does not, since they're a holding. And ANet will certainly not be the same after they merge them with NCsoft West.
---
Roleplayers ;)
---
Nah, this is the last straw for me. Never comming back.
---
&gt; yeah and i'm not really wrong
---
You are objectively wrong.
---
Actually guild wars 2 had its best living world only quarter in 2018. It actually exceeded expectations by making $70 million last year. I think that success got to management's head and they thought they could do another living world season 
---
You missed the beta. I wonder if they'll bring that back for a limited time.
---
They said that ["the Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 game services will not be affected, nor is any upcoming game content canceled."](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-02-21-arenanet-reportedly-bracing-for-mass-layoffs) As others noted at the time, that's not the same as saying the GW2 team would be untouched.
---
 That kills me. Goddamn....
---
This.
---
They sorely need to work other communication. Leaving the community always wondering for things that'll probably never come, is what makes people eventually quit the game.
---
City of heroes was one of the top MMOs when it got shuttered. Top 5, definitely 10. Screw ncsoft. I don't trust any of this. It's heartbreaking. I'll see when they release content, but given the development cycle we won't see ghee effects for 6 months so ies going to be a long time before I say I trust the game again. 
---
There is no source. Like a lot of what's been going on since shit hit the fan, a lot of speculation presented as fact, even if with apparently reasonable rationale.
---
Is it?
---
If you stop supporting the game now, then you stop supporting the many employees who are still working on the game. Don't claim to care about the people who made the game if you only care about *some* of the people who made the game.
---
Many of the seniors voluntarily left, and the ones that didn't like Josh, seems to have been moved to other content ages ago. What was the last time we heard about him? Ember bay JP
---
...I don't think I can play this game anymore.
---
Dedication is a kind of challenge. I don't enjoy it myself very much, but it is something people take pride and enjoyment in, and what gives them the meaning and feeling of accomplishment they want from an MMO.
---
&gt; but grinding gold forever isn't my idea of fun
---
Then just accept that the shinies that require heavy grinding aren't made for you. The problem being discussed here is that "toxic casuals" feel entitled to not only get the stuff that's for sale in the gem store, but everything there is, so the game is dumped down to their skill/dedication levels across the board. That includes content as well as rewards, to the point where the only raid left in the game that actually offers a good amount of high-quality rewards is raiding the gem store with a credit card.
---
Not in the slightest though? Feel free to correct me if you wish.
---
Give us the tea Bobby. On a scale of 1/10? 
---
There were a lot of *redditors* saying that. I don't think ANet issued a statement to that exact effect, though.
---
Oh Dwayna bless ya, see ya there o/
---
They feel like shit because it happened to them and they want to show solidarity with their co-workers. There's nothing wrong with that just because your co-workers haven't said anything (though you are whining now).
---
So they let go of one of their two wvw devs
---
Haha my wallet says i cant have two mmos. Plus, there are games coming up i am very interested in. Mario Maker 2 is up there as i still play Mario Maker 1 on occasion. Plus, there are so many first party or interesting titles coming to the switch that i basically have a game a month to play all year, if not multiple games. Ill definitely play Ffxiv eventually. Im too big of a Final Fantasy fan to not.
---
There are still 300 employees. It's a big cut and some big names are gone but the game is not dead yet.
---
Ben's leaving as well? Aww geez, Josh and Ben... my two favourite devs gone x-x;
---
They say the game won't be affected, but how could it not be? They're cutting the developers whose work we've come to know and love.
---
&gt; ArenaNet told employees it will be giving out severance of two months to anyone losing their jobs, as well as bonus time based on tenure with the company.

---
There is, it's called raids.  They aren't hard.
---
I wish I shared in your naivety.
---
When you've been attached to a hobby that might suddenly disappear after 7 years, people will act like that.
---
It's true!
---
Arenanet's business model has always been to mostly underpay their devs, and rely on people just getting started in the industry who are willing to take low pay to get their foot in the door.  They work for a few years and then leave for a job with real pay some place else.  The fact they're getting rid of the small core of senior people makes it sound like they're doubling down on that strategy.
---
Im sorry but what the actual Frog is going on here . I’m livid about this whole situation 
---
$$$
---
Senior talent is expensive. Junior talent not as much.
---
I thought I saw some official announcement or a twitter post saying that. But I'm probably just smoking crack. Wouldn't be the first time reddit hearsay and official announcements blurred together in my memory.
---
I appreciate you clarifying it.
---
Today was rough.

The friends list in this game is more of a "favorite" list if anything.

Not this industry. Every industry.

Even the oldest job in the world should be properly regulated and its employees unionized.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imSXl2a6wUE This one's mine.
---
There is an easy mode. It's called normal mode. Hard mode is challenge mote. 
---
With all the power creep and how much the meta has evolved, raids are disgustingly easy to clear. You could stack 4 healers and face tank every mechanic while putting dps on auto attack only builds and still beat raids. Raids are literally as easy as some open world events.
---
*OwO, what's this? * It's your **3rd Cakeday** konnsky! ^(hug)
---
Lol. Ok bro.
---
Hey, thanks for the response! I really appreciate it. There are a ton of people out here who love and support all of the hard working team members of anet. You've heard it before, but these games have made a lasting impact on us, cliched as it is to say. 
---
Not that I'm not really happy you responded to me, but maybe hop off reddit for a bit? I imagine there is a lot being said here - true, untrue, support, hate, hyperbole, etc. that you, and the rest of the team, are probably best being away from. 
---
Once again, thanks for everything.
---
:(
---
McKennas position is just described as Game Designer from what I could find. She just happened to flagship WvW World Linking in 2016/17.
---
From what I can tell the Teams that house Raids Fractals WvW PvP etc. are not clearly seperable. They are more of a conglomerate of teams that have a lot of overlapping subsets.
---
If you want publishers to stop reaping developer after developer in this endless cycle, then people need to stand together.

Anyone heard if Linsey Murdock is safe?

[removed]
---
I wish it was a joke. 
---
It's not about "oh boo hoo, I don't get my mount".  It's about the state of the game, which is very worrying to people heavily invested in it.  Their first statement after the layoff news leaked was that GW2 services won't be affected.  A week later, that has already been proved to be BS.  It's worrying to say the least.
---
Ive never seen a subreddit mod go power hungry. You are one pathetic excuse for one.
---
Probably not, but if you buy the expansions it’s the best $40 you will ever spend 
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **2nd Cakeday** CreamCheeseIsBad! ^(hug)

I remember her and her frog back in gw1... ran into her at a convention last year but decided to not say anything cause I'd rather let her be. Still stand by that decision but it's a little sad I won't see her around anymore. 
---
I worked with Cam when he was just QA. Was a hard core GW1 fan and GW2 fan. When HoT and raids were coming out, he lead a lot of the very complicated QA passes for them, and then ended up writing them. Later down the line he was responsible for cheering on a lot of the GW1 related insertions into the newest expansion. He had his hand in a lot of living world stuff too. I'll be honest, I fell out of contact. 
---
Other than that, he made a lot of cool map designs that I don't think were for anet projects. Don't think for a second you've seen the last of Cam or Foreman. 
---
Mate, I've already gone and installed Elder Scrolls Online after hearing this news. I loved this game at one point, but the past year of development has really been a disappointment. Not even mentioning the communication issues.
---
I stopped playing when content release went from every few weeks to several months.
---
When that content went from keeping you busy for a few weeks to completing 100% achievements in a weekend.
---
When copy &amp; paste holidays became the only thing to look forward to.
---
When reskins and mounts became the chief release.
---
When PVP became completely ignored.
---
When we were told it was too hard to implement Tengu or any other race.
---
When we were told we're only getting outfits because armor is too hard.
---
When game discussions were hijacked by social issues.
---
When 9/10 Reddit posts were about fan art instead of the actual game.
---
Just because you love something doesn't make it good; doesn't make it last.
---
It's still top 5 MMOs because only 2 contenders have come out since 2012.
---
I had 24+ characters, 30k+ AP, and an embarassing number of months play time. It pains me to accept that GW2 has been dead for a while.
---
*"...I don't know."*
---
thanks for that - so it's federal, not California, which means everyone here gets at least 60 days paid, but I'm sure there will be some sort of severance on top of that.  Hardly good news but could be worse.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Would be redundant if/when they introduce alliances.
---
Yeah but that's exactly one of my main arguments: When was Power of the Mists scrapped, and when will we *maybe* get alliances? 3 years difference or something like that? And in the meantime we're left hanging without any substantial information? And that's their approach for almost everything, including balance.
---
I think it's easier to solve than people believe it is; provide an incentive for experienced players helping new ones. The bigger the disparity the better.
---
For example; kill counts becoming tracked in the game, as hidden achievements. When a player who has (say) 100 kills of Dhuum is in a party with 0 kills, or under 10 kills of Dhuum, they gain a transparent buff allowing them to have a chance at some unique loot, such as recoloured weapons and armor. There's no functional difference between the originals and this prestige skin, except that it is **obviously** a prestige skin.
---
It would be open to abuse, but frankly, everything is, so I like to think the benefits outweigh the costs.
---
It wouldn't even be that hard to implement, and it could be used in a lot of places; just imagine revitalizing dungeons with high-def armor skins implemented this way, for example.

Holy shit your a mod on this subreddit and you dont even know what the fucks going on. Seriously dude take a step back from the computer.
---
It's a pretty insincere thing for the management to say.  It's like if them being fired had no effect on GW2, then why the f did you hire them in the first place?  When everyone already know a lot of those people work on GW2?
---
On other hands, this pretty much shattered my hope that GW1 getting any more minor quality of life fixes :(
---
My guess is that probably depends on the financial outcome of season 5. But I definitely don't think an expansion is in the works right now.
---
It does, the majority of the playerbase are window-licking weebs that wouldn't know how to deal with a mechanic if it bashed them in the face repeatedly. That's not to say there aren't great players and cool people, but the average playerbase is about as carebear as it gets.
---
How many people do you think they had in support alone?
---
Yeah man I feel you, the only mmorpg I've really stuck with besides gw2 is Eso. Amazing Lore, pretty fluent combat (not as good as gw but still pretty good) alot of end game content maybe not the most hardcore out there but definitely equally good (imo better) as gw. And if I might add a very friendly community 
---
whilst all this is sad, don't be surprise if this is the kick up the arse the rest needed. Way to many people have been sitting on their hands doing stuff all work and expecting grand praise. The community TRIED to tell them the game needed work, they tried to tell them what they wanted. But Anet as a whole ignored that, and now they are reaping what they sewed.  Whilst you are scared for the future of the game, I for once feel hopefully that it will only get better. 
---
Remember that the Snowman raid was done mostly by an intern... 
---
Thank you for staying with us Bobby. We're seeing so many well known people in the community leave and it's breaking our hearts. I'm so sorry to see people go, but at the same time I want to continue playing the game with the family that made it.
---
Get your head out your ass, raids need more players to be viable, and they'll never get them without easy mode.
---
So you're saying that FFXIV does for $15 a month that GW2 did for free? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
I feel like this would have been a stronger post without involving this person's commentary at all, frankly.
---
Im not crying, its just dusty in here... ya, thats it.... got some dust in my eye.... 
---
GW1 2,776 hours
---
GW2 6,694 hours
---
My first GW1 character is nearly 13 years old, and I'm 24. I've been into guild wars more than half my life.
---
Not at all, FFXIV is like chess compared to GW2 combat, it is glacial pace with very little freedom of movement, if you love dodging and dashing in GW2 you will probably hate FFXIV's combat.
---
Yeah, no, I don't see any false info either.
---
My point wasn't the type of content they released or how they use said content but the development time required to make the content, how many people would love it if we got 2 fractals every 3 months? Or hell, if they brought back dungeons and we got 1 fractal and 1 dungeon every 3 months? You could even tie the story into the dungeons similar to The Ruined City of Arah so the content appeals to story players too. As for primals, they have the purpose. A few hours to down the boss on extreme and then farming the mount, no different to legendary weapons in GW2 in that people love cosmetics, especially ones with prestige. 
---
Point is, I had a reason to log into FFXIV every day and do some new content because it had some rewards attached, what reason do I have to revisit the living story maps? There are a few with worthwhile meta events such as Istan but all I'm getting is a meager amount of gold. My current goal is to obtain Sunrise in GW2, but the fact that I can just whip out my wallet and pay $200 *instead* of spending well over 100 hours to get it is somewhat demotivating, it removes all prestige associated with the weapon too. I also find the G2 legendaries to be really ugly for the most part, so I have no incentive to spend many hours working on those. FFXIV could use a horizontal progression system for their dungeons and just make them stack onto the current ones and update the loot of the older dungeons to current ilvls, why they don't do that is beyond me but this isn't a discussion about solving FFXIV's issues. 
---
I can't disagree that FFXIV's open world content is complete garbage, their FATE system pales in comparison to GW2's dynamic events and there's not much reason to visit the open world beyond gathering. I can't speak for WoW in its current state but back when I still played in Legion the world quests were great, usually fun to do and provided decent rewards at the time which gave you a reason to visit the amazing world they had crafted. Both XIV and GW2 focus on different things, the problem is that GW2 has no consistent vision of what it wants to be while SE knows the direction they want XIV to go in, a game primarily built around instanced content and it excels at that. Now GW2 is all over the place, we have open world content that is released half finished, raids that are very rarely released and aren't nearly as great as what you'd find in FFXIV or WoW, dungeons that were completely abandoned, PvP which has the PvP community confused due to the lack of direction and fractals. What does GW2 excel at? They have no clear idea of what they want to do with the game. 
---
I don't think GW2 will ever see a massive jump in population without something like a console release at this point as you said, they had their chance and blew it. Their best bet would be to try to keep their current playerbase while slowly attracting new players but I am not at all confident that they can deliver a new project. Let's say they have a new MMO in development, with the recent layoffs they either scrap that entirely or let GW2 suffer more than it already has for another 3-6 years while work on the new project. They don't have much options at this point other than going mobile and how many of us want to play GW Mobile? They're now left with a team of 300, that's just enough to support an MMO but definitely not enough to built a major AAA title unless it was mobile.  
---
Personally I would have loved to see a SP RPG based on the Guild Wars IP, their world building is absolutely amazing and they clearly want to tell a story and an MMO isn't the best genre for it. It would have been far less effort than developing a new MMO and could have been on all major platforms, it wouldn't cannibalize GW2 as it would be its own thing and could attract people to GW2 afterwards. it's too late to be wishing about things that won't ever happen now, I suppose. 
---
FFXI was dated from release, just launched a few years prior to WoW which revolutionized many things in the MMORPG genre, streamlining them and pushing the genre forward. They *needed* a new game because reworking FFXI would be a monumental effort, FFXIV on the other has everything up to 7.0 planned as stated by Yoshi-P, which is another 6 years out assuming it ends after 5 major patches to 7.0. Plans don't always pan out and that doesn't mean they won't release another MMO in the meanwhile of course, so we'll refer to other titles such as Runescape and WoW which have been going strong for many years, OSRS is still growing and RS3 is still very profitable despite the dwindling playerbase. 
---
people return to play SAB after not playing for 12 months, clearly a huge draw for players, so they keep it limited time and put not more development into it. These are the sort of reasons lay offs are happening, because Anet as a whole stopped using their heads. 
---
they got rid of gaile??? of all people?????? gaile????????????????

Found some more dirt on the useless power hungry mod
---
Hm, I think this is positive to be honest. Normally, you'd be publicly quartered for talking about the problems this game and the company have. It's a taboo in this community.
---
yeah buddy of mine plays that game and raids there, says you can get banned if you kick someone from a group for bad dps since dps meters aren't allowed. 
---
that plus the care bear community will make me never play that game tbh. 
---
They mad. I gotchu
---
You do realize that gw2s income is on the low end of ncsofts spectrum right? They make way more than gw2 does with single mobile games 
---
There's someone called trixxi morigna who's runs amazing hp trains in na. Not sure if she stopped doing it though.
---
Yeah, there were definitely some things about FFXIV that I liked and wished GW2 had, but ultimately I just decided it wasn't the game for me when I had to convince myself to just log in. :P
---
Unless some other amazing game pops up, I think I'll just have close the MMO chapter of my life whenever GW2 finally kicks the bucket honestly.
---
that's not the investors fault, Anet devs shit the bed. They had a great base game to build on and done stuff all with it since. 
---
They didn't fire the entire studio, and gw2 still makes profit and is one of top MMORPG, there are more reasons to keep it going than to make it end
---
&gt; It absolutely is at max level. Way more than WoW is. 
---
I don't play FFXIV, so I took a look at a random parse on fflogs.com.
---
Most of the players in it were playing at 25 APM. The top end was... 38 APM.
---
I look at a recent mythic kill from my WoW guild... Where the lowest end (The healers) are at 32 APM, and the top end (Feral druid, assassination rogue, fury warrior, brewmaster) are all at &gt;60 APM.
---
I'm going to go ahead and say that no, FFXIV is not faster-paced then WoW.
---
I'm sorry to all the human beings who are losing their jobs, but this might be good for the game.
---
SAB hasn't been updated in what, 4 years? It's about time ArenaNet considered putting resources into revamping and adding to existing content instead of driving at new stuff that'll be used for a month then never touched again. 
---
I'd be curious to know what kind of company you think your can compare a game company to.
---
This is huge for those that love fractals.  Pretty much getting the can.  It'll be the same as when Grouch left and what happened to PvP or when Devon left and WvW.
---
Sounds like LWS5 will happen then GW2 will have some kind of rebuilding phase.  Hopefully this means improvements for the game and meaningful content.  Such a shame to see such talented people like Ben and Josh leaving though.
---
There will be constant updates to GW2 before they came up with something brand new. They still need GW2 to make them money and sustain the company.
---
How is MO?
---
Have read he was in tears today...
---
Didn't they say last week that the GW2 team wasn't being affected? It was other parts of NCsoft

Over 100 of the remaining developers friends have just lost their jobs so excuse them if they want to give something a miss so the can comprehend what has happened.
---
Expect to see some significant changes to how content is monetized in this game, whether that entails removal of gold to gem conversion or something else, difficult to say right now, but I would confidently say expect the monetization structure change significantly. 
---
Believe me.  If game devs had a union, I am confident that there would be *no shortage* of pull from the investors.
---
Oh yeah typical I call you out for caring more about a patch and your first instinct is to pick me up on my grammar grow up.
---
Same thing I have been for a few years now, FFXIV.
---
This is so easy to abuse that if I was an experienced raider, I would never use this to help players at all. I would make new accounts over new accounts for the extra reward. As a bonus, the raid sellers would get a big boost in income.
---
It might help some players maybe. But the abuse on it will dramatically overshadow the benefits. 
---
Good question. Afaik you dont need to patch game in order to enable buffs like this.

I'm gonna be downloading Destiny 2 pretty soon and seeing how I like it. I have fairly high hopes considering I enjoy Warframe which is vaguely similar. I'll probably stick around a *little,* but I want to see a content roadmap before I stop regretting all the time and money I invested into this game.
---
I have a really hard time believing any of these layoffs are necessary.
---
I care about quite a few things simultaneously; the patch, the layoffs, the remaining workers, if I should spend time or money on the game going forward. Further I can also care about your inability to utilize a comma or period now and again.
---
I would imagine that LS4e6 is probably almost complete. Episodes 4 and 5 came on the later end of the 2-3 month release cycle, coupled with wintersday, so episode 5 was especially late. It wouldn't surprise me if 6 was mostly done; they'd potentially hold it back just to lessen the gap until S5e1.
---
What really sucks is that episode 5 personally gave me like...4 hours worth of playtime. I just couldn't get into it, and this was after really enjoying the currency grind/meta for Jahai Bluffs. 
---
Gaile Gray also got the axe ;x
---
Came here to ask if anyone has any footage of her GW1 going-away party. My wife and I were there, and it was very cool. And I think they made her two  unique minis. I know one was a frog, but I can't remember what the other one was.

Bethesda Softworks' Zenimax Online (ESO) is also hiring for a ton of positions: [https://jobs.zenimax.com/locations/view/7](https://jobs.zenimax.com/locations/view/7)

/salute 
---
On an Xbox controller, you have A B X Y LB RB for basic buttons, which you can then use LT and RT as modifiers (hold LT to change the function of ABXY RB LB for example, which gives you effectively 18 buttons (6 buttons x 3 different states). Then there's D pad on top of that. 
---
I'd say you could map most functions to a controller. 
---
Normally a company puts out x amount of voluntary redundancies and gives a time frame to take it, then if there isn't enough volunteers the company will pick the rest.

They could of taken a redundancy by choice, which when taken starts your last 2 weeks.

RIP GW2
---
I'm planning on upgrading my pc, so I want to check out BDO. Honestly I have zero desire to do anything endgame in that game, I mostly just want to level up characters, get the awakening skills, and explore the open world which is just gorgeous.
---
But I mean, I also hope to be playing GW2 for the foreseeable future. 
---
Why would anyone release a content patch when the company is in the middle of a mass layoff? Management has to sort out the chain of command, and determine who should fill the shoes of the laid-off employees, while minimizing impact to the workflow. It's generally a chaotic period, it might even take a while for Anet to re-adjust to the new reality. 
---
 
---
Anet is cutting 25% of its' workforce, it's no joke. Employees are probably asking themselves"who should I report to now?" "what's gonna take over X's job scope?" "in what way am I affected?" 
---
This makes me think of Big Hero Six
---
I don't think you understand the meaning of "other".
---
You would too if you knew the cash flow you would see as the head of the company. I can bet you anything that as much Chris Metzen loved Blizzard and his WoW baby, he loves the money that allowed him to retire on a luxurious lifestyle in California at 40 years old.
---
&gt; Eh, I don't think she's been suitable for the position for a while. She's been fairly bitter and out of touch recently.
---
Thank god I'm not alone. I don't know Gaile from gw1 days, but all of you guys seem to talk about a completely different person. Or you don't visit the official forums. She's hostile and mostly sees players of their game as an enemy. It wasn't really a pleasure to communicate with her if you had no praise to sing, but rather requests, critique, questions or issues you wanted to have resolved.
---
Final straw was [this comment](https://imgur.com/a/aLCB5tL) by her that really shows what she thinks. I won't miss her.
---
The game declined for me a month after PoF. Went to play Legion.
---
Why?
---
By that logic everything (even the most stupid thing you can imagine) is right just because it is what Anet decided to put into the game. That argument makes no sense whatsoever.
---
There are different people enjoying different thinks in the game. Some enjoy skill challenges, some enjoy farming, some enjoy just buying nice things, some enjoy other things.
---
People who enjoy farming want the things they farm to feel rewarding. Things only feel rewarding if they are rare, so not everyone can obtain them just by wishing for them. That is why a hand full of sand feels less rewarding than a hand full of diamonds. There needs to be a barrier, and for people who like farming that barrier should be that you have to actually farm.
---
The mere fact that you want to be able to buy your way around all those barriers makes the rewards behind them much less rewarding for everyone else who actually did the farming to get them. It's like being able to buy an Olympic metal.
---
Same thing with any other kind of challenge in the game.
---
I keep forgetting about SAB.  What a brilliant game Guild Wars 2 is overall.  
---
So if calling one stream a rando asshat is a fireable offense, I'm sure everyone is going to demand Derior be kicked off the official partner program for telling the entire PvE community to fuck off, right?
---
Right?  Haha, of course not.
---
PS - Love all the white supremacy memes in your chat, Derior.
---
haha....
---
:P Yup. Here, I can give an announcement on behalf of literally every studio who has every released a successful video game. "We are pleased to announce that we're using the funds from the success of this game to begin development on any number of other games. Many of these projects will be cancelled or go through fundamental changes in direction, so we cannot possibly provide any useful information about them. We hope you look forward to maybe playing one of these games in the future if it, and we as a studio, survive until it hits the market."
---
:S There, no more surprises ever again.
---
No, I actually mean stronger.
---
JP's proven to be a seasoned dramatist, and that's not a statement of hate; she's a shit-disturber, which actually may be very valuable given her narrative-focused job goals. It's a trainable skill.
---
Add to that how people react to Kotaku as a news venue, and I think putting the two of them side by side just feels... I don't know, off.
---
I agree, routinely, with a lot of JP's core statements, and I agree, truth should be truth, *but* so much of the emotional side of discussing these issues is about context that I think unfortunately, using someone like JP to set context just doesn't work very well.
---
What's the combat and movement like? I really liked the dynamic style of gw2.
---
I guess i forget they're a publisher in addition to a studio. Thank you!
---
Thread removed: Not relevant to Guild Wars 2.
---
The news about all the gw2 devs being laid off today sorta confirms my suspicions... yikes.
---
I always thought raids stood out as the most uncharacteristic thing in Guild Wars. Everything else from GW1 onwards, at least over time, grew into "accessible, but challenging if you want it." GW2 raids never got that, the active playerbase never seemed to want it, and it remained completely inaccessible to casuals (like me).
---
Aurene died so you can live! You can't let her (it?) down.

I don’t play weaver too much but IIRC both have pretty good cleave.

There is nothing wrong making a mobile game.
---
Blizzard’s mistake was pretending a mobile game is something big and expecting fans to be excited.
---
No human female meta!
---
I came back to the game about a month ago and was about to pull the trigger on the xpacs. I think I'll wait to see what they plan to do on the future.
---
I would be surprised if it wasn't to be perfectly honest. I read right after posting this that the office will be shut to restructure. So I believe it will be with the claw. Ah, well. I've been itching for that patch for weeks, so, I'm just anxious to see the changes  
---
What are the pants? There is usually a cape attached, so color me intrigued!
---
I know those boots, but failing to recall which weight set they are from :/
---
Given how the community reacted last time they gave something of a road map (which unsurprisingly didnt perfectly work out because nothing ever does in game dev), I cant really say its a reasonable request. At least not if you mean anything more than "we will work on another living world season/an expansion at some point".
---
I raided exclusively to get the raid mastery line unlocked, and the whole thing was nearly impenetrable to me. Honestly, I agree with OP here -- with easy mode raids people like me may have played and may have graduated into regular raids.
---
IMO I really don't get the pushback on this. Almost everything else in GW has a gradual curve, just not GW2 raids.
---
That's impressive. 
---
So, this is very tricky and somewhat misleading:  
---
1. In other countries they aren't allowed to just "mass fire" employees, but in some of those countries (I can't speak to all) that is a two way street in that the employees also can't up and leave either. The last job I worked at was absolutely horrible to employees, but were careful to keep themselves just right of the legal line in both the US and EU. One of my teammates was German and was fed up, but to leave he had to either give a 1 year notice or hope he could re-negotiate his contract to leave. He was successful in the latter. My point is that the grass is not always greener on the otherside. There are always pros and cons.
---
2. Layoffs will happen, no matter what. I've seen it in companies as small as 200 people. If an employee's role is no longer needed or used, I don't think there are many countries that force you to keep paying them to do nothing. It absolutely sucks and it definitely is abused by some companies &lt;cough&gt; Activision &lt;cough&gt;, but it is also a reality of business. It's better to let go of a chunk of people than to end up having to close down and fire everyone due to bleeding money. Many companies plan 2-3 years out and if the current profits are forecasted to lose money in that time, they will cut costs to ensure the business survives. Doesn't make the pain any better and doesn't mean that there aren't companies using the system in malicious ways, but it's probably rarer than people think.
---
3. Determining fault in an organization is a lot harder than you realize. I worked for a subsidiary of very large Japanese company and due to the way the politics had worked out, there was effectively a barrier between the top-level management in Japan and the lower tier management everywhere else. There was no way for the top-tier mgmt, regardless of my opinion of them, to know what was going on because we had to go through the people causing the problems to get to the top tier mgmt..... which of course would never make it.
---
All I'm trying to say is that there is no silver bullet and no way this will ever get solved. We, unfortunately, live in an imperfect world where sometimes the only choices are "bad" and "worse". You never choose the "worse" option.... and, yes a CEO or manager could take a pay cut to help out, except when the layoff directive comes from above the CEO or President's head.... (Which I might add, in this case, was from a non-US company). 
---
yeah, it's like the community is acting like they canned gaile or something. it would never come to that, the revenues are too high
---
ok changed to currently staying
---
i know massivelyop already had a list but i though it might be better do make a post on reddit aswell, since its easier to keep the list updated if more people contribute
---
This is typical NCSoft right here, sadly.  I seriously mean it is a horrible company that I saw for what it was back in the beta of City of Heroes and I see nothing has changed.  I went to a few of their ip over the last decade+ and they always money grab and shit all over people (workers and players).  Anet should live and kill ncsoft before they ruin anything more.   Yes, I consider them worse than the plague.
---
just post anyone which i may have missed so far and i try to keep this updated
---
Bless.
---
raids are casual... People just are incapable of dodge rolling, dpsing, and standing some where safe all at the same time. Every raid cept for a couple wing bosses is a you vs a platform mechanic. It's the same in high level fractals. 
---
What is SAB?
---
Linsey Murdock is staying, cannot link source but Bobby Stein confirmed on a reddit post. 
---
Could be...or this is it. I’ve been through layoffs that were every three months for a year to avoid notification
---
Hijacking this to remind everyone that the story (and the game as a whole) are created by a team. A lead pushes things in a direction, but the stuff you see in the game was worked over by many people to make it as impactful/funny/epic as it is. Respect all the other hardworking people in that image of the narrative team.
---
I can recommend ESO as well, but you'll really want the subscription, if only for the crafting bag, and the last time I played they still had major instancing issues when trying to join instanced dungeons; endless loading screens eventually killed it for me. Also, you will never, ever, catch up to the current champion point cap, no matter how much EXP grinding you attempt, and they are always raising the cap. There's actually plenty of major issues to put you off about the game, but I'd still recommend it, if only as a break from GW2. Let's hope we can always come back to GW2.
---
I mean I’ve been critical of ANET for the last couple months. But this post seems really insensitive.

Wing 4 boss 1, 2 and 3 are the easiest bosses in the game. Cairn, Mursaat Overseer and Samarog.   But since you mentioned learning basic forms of mechanics, wing 1 boss 1 Vale Guardian is the perfect example. You have to defeat a red, a green and a blue Guardian before being able to start the actual boss.
---
 The red one spawns orbs called seekers that deal heavy damage when you touch them and he is only vulnerable to condition damage. The seekers spawn far away, will approach you and despawn after some time. 
---
The green green spawns small aoes around players that detonate after 2-3 seconds and teleport caught players to random locations. You have to dodge, block them or walk away. The aoe makes a loud noise and your screen border turns yellow so it's easy to notice.
---
The blue Guardian spawns a green aoe and 4 players have to stand inside to prevent it from exploding. If it explodes everyone receives 90% damage. Meanwhile he recieves protection that makes him invulnerable and you need boon strip. 
---
When fighting Vale Guardian you will have red seekers, blues teleports and green bombs. The general strategie is to heal up as soon as the green explodes and mesmers or healers pull/ push away the seekers. This way people actually have to only deal with avoiding getting teleported. At 66% and 33% VG splits into its 3 color forms and the group has to split up. That's it basicly. Imo a boss with a perfect mechanics tutotial. The challange is to deal with all of them at once.
---
/salute.  As I’ve gotten older, I have  had significantly less time to play any sort of video game. Somehow I’ve always had time for GW2. 
---
This. And stick to their commitments. They can't keep delaying releases after setting dates for them. This was a difficult time, sure, but what's the excuse for many patches leading up to this?
---
I mean I've watched videos and read the wiki but having never done it, it's not like I can join a pug and expect them to not lose their shit if I make mistakes.
---
They hopefully learned not to keep up the facade of putting all their effort on the game while pushing people into new projects rather than delivering what they promised.
---
Wow. This just speaks to my soul here. You really hit the nail on the head for me and I couldn't agree more.
---
Thank you for saying this.
---
One of the mods pointed out that Gw2 does look really good in terms of MMOs, which gives me some hope that they'll look to atleast try and maintain things; but if raids aren't on their list then that's really going to disappoint me.
---
And yeh, hopefully they'll let us know some stuff ASAP... given all the delays and stuff, the layoffs, and the people leaving, its just all stressful.
---
Gailey Gray?? Really????
---
Allegedly they had already been transferred to another project. So if anything was affecting GW2 it was their over-commitment to whatever that was.
---
I feel it really is gonna depend on the weapons you enjoy using. I would personally love to play power instead of condi, but the only weapons I can stand on Ranger are the condi ones.
---
I'm just here to say thanks for letting us know this time.
---
I thought Lena went freelance a while ago.
---
Share with the rest of us what you think are the best content.
---
Then you are helping contribute to NCSoft's potential decision to shut down the studio. Congratulations.
---
Astrologian's buffing gameplay revolves around drawing random "cards" (out of 6 different ones) then having different actions you can take with said cards (an unwanted card can be reshuffled, turned into a modifier for the next card, or sacrificed for a big heal or damage spell. or it can be saved for later when it's actually needed). All of this is done using off-GCD spells, and keep in mind AST is a healer in a game where healing is required for fights, meaning it needs to keep up its healing through GCDs while at the same time managing buffs(cards) and making on-the-fly decisions on how to use them.	An optimized AST will be able to make those decisions in the ~.5 second window between the draw and the next GCD.
---
As for the DPS classes things tend to be more rigid, but many fights require you to know your rotation well in order to know how it can be deviated from (in case of mechanics) as to not lose certain buffs or mess up combos. But personally, I was impressed by the healer (and especially AST) gameplay and how intense it can get during a difficult fight. 
---
I'm in AU (NA servers) so I'm in an awkward middle ground. I have full asc. on my main. I appreciate the offer though.
---
First Aurene, now this. 
---
By then hopefully anet will have been able to lick their wounds a little bit.
---
Wishful thinking
---
Kaybe it was nerfed, but my boy W/N or N/W MoP with 100 blades sure wasn't. Who needs tankiness if everything dies in half a sec?
---
Wildstar was published but it fell flat. Flatter than paper--possibly so negative that it created a black hole.
---
Yeah, fuck him for talking about gw2 on a gw2 subreddit.
---
It should be no surprise that sweeping budget cuts would impact high profile, highly paid veterans. 
---
Whether you agree with the reasons that initiated the budget cuts or not is a different story.
---
Since offenses are reviewed by GM's, you wouldn't be banned for such a response. Contrary to rumors, you get bans for harassment, not the use of the parser.
---
I just avoid people telling me "you don't get to tell me how to play" on PuGs because often I find that the people who want to get carried are the least receptive to advise to improve, especially when you put it in the recruitment description what you expect and they join anyways.

Mentioning union in the same sentence... ffs. How about Shop Stewards who neglect their duties for the union for their own personal interests and extra pay to allow union members to get laid off before their disputes are ever heard. Two way street in the south, corrupt union members with lack of education, versus those of the north who realize they are fighting for your rights. Not against those who actually realize what a union is for, but man, fuck those who abuse it for themselves. 
---
Until we meet again
---
Yeah i dont get it, i mean im super into gw2 and have been playing every day for 6 years but i dont really care who develops the game. I assume they want to keep making money of the game so i assume there will be more content to come.
---
God forbid this game dies. But if it does, I'm going to play it until the lights turn off. 
---
&gt; Might try some other games until NCSoft gets their shit together.
---
NCSoft is a monstrous company. They will never get their shit together because they could fuck up so badly in the west that they have no presence here at all and it wouldn't matter because how big they are in the east.
---
I don't want to be a broken record, but seriously; this is not the first time NCSoft has done something shitty, and you know for a damn fact that it won't be the last. 
---
Honestly I will keep supporting this game as long as I can. Even if nothing really new comes out, I’ll have time to finish all the stuff I’ve put off. The only single thing that would make me change my mind is how it’s restructured.  If those incredible people are replaced by those who have no love or loyalty to the current lore and content, I’m done.
---
If it follows the current NCSoft model then I will say my farewells before all my good memories are tainted. The cold, hard truth I’ve seen about NCSoft is that they care very little for the IP, but the only thing that matters is what nets them the most $.
---
My girlfriend broke up with me the same time this news came up. So I'm definitely going places. Ha ha ha
---
We can panic now, right?
---
As soon as I heard about the impending layoffs my first thought was "MO and the remaining founders must be kicking themselves for not breaking away from NCsoft."
---
I'm not happy to see that I'm right.
---
Fight knowledge. You can follow the SMN and BLM chart all you want but if you get chosen by a mechanic your whole chart can fall apart, and in the case of extended burn phase classes with strict sine-wave output like the summoner, activating your trance/bahamut just as you get picked for a mechanic or the boss phases will royally screw you.
---
And all you listed is included in GW2 anyways except it's even more simplistic and far less intuitive because GW2's complete lack of UI customization and ability cd tracking tools.
---
Sadly the question on most people's minds (including mine) is what happens after the next raid wing which is confirmed.
---
think i will move this as "other" for now?
---
/salute ❤
---
BR shooter != mmo, lmao
---
The thing that people against gw3 fail to realise is that gw2 will come to an end of content  at one point no matter what. So now instead of getting a replacement and areanet growing into other genres, u will get nothing. This is just the beginning and it's sad some people think even with all their resources on gw2, it would make enough to have 300 employees in NCsoft eyes. Either they have other project or I see other mass layoff in the 2 years to come.
---
Hasn't QT gone to Maple story?
---
You aren't wrong lol. When we say easy mode we mean story mode dungeon level easy.
---
They aren't adding a new one, they will split the 2 data centers in a 3rd to ease the overload. That is bad, the game doesn't have a mega server and this will split even more the player base.
---
It’s always south...
---
Are raids super easy or something?
---
Cynically, they probably thought their unannounced project(s) would be off the ground by then and GW2 wouldn't be their only revenue stream.
---
So, when he was a fresh young art dev on GW1, he was the guy who designed the Ascalonian runes (was originally just a rip-off of the Phoenician alphabet) and a lot of the other languages around the place; then in GW2, he spent a lot of time on implementing the actual translatable languages you see around the place like New Krytan and Asuran. Art and environment might seem like nothing to you, but his work has been utterly integral to worldbuilding, and making the GW series feel fleshed out. 
---
He's also been quite informative on a lot of lore questions, and just seemed like a really cool guy. Weird flex here, but he joined my squad for Thunderhead Keep and I was so star-struck I didn't say a damn thing about it, despite having about a million lore questions I wanted to blurt out XD

FFXIV Savage raids are fairly challenging. A lot more challenging than most of what Guild Wars has to offer. I posted this further down, but [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRLBmuiFnO4) is a guide of the current final savage boss. Gives you an idea of the complexity of the mechanics.
---
Then you have Ultimate, which is easily some of the hardest PvE content to ever exist in an MMO. [Here](http://clees.me/guides/ucob/) is a guide for the harder of the 2 Ultimate fights to give you an idea.
---
would this be a good idea to make this a sticky?
---
so everyone can keep track of the current stand of the laid offs?
---
good night sweet frog. :(
---
People panic without communication and organization. Based on everything that has been shared with us, what else can be expected? Clearly GW2 will not be isolated from the changes happening at ANet. 
---
&gt; a stolen magnetic bomb in raids deals huge amounts of damage it is sometimes even beneficial to use improv instead of executioner because of that
---
What encounters would it be more beneficial to use Improv vs Executioner?
---
Puro pay to win el reddit ahora
---
Is he the friend you mentioned in another thread you were concerned about? Feels bad man 😥
---
😀
---
Thankfully both games are in really strong places right now, with FFXIV ramping up to what looks to be their most feature packed expansion to date, and ESO kicking off a brand new release schedule for regular new content. 
---
It's not low because raids are bad, it's low because we get approximately one per year.
---
My plan is to sticky the summary post about everything since there are also going to be a lot of questions about why no patch come tomorrow. I'm going to directly link to this post and credit you with it in the section about who has been let go. Still working on writing it all up. 
---
This is not the first time that layoffs happened at a game studio, nor will it be the last. I was unconcerned when Acti-Blizz laid off ~800 employees, even though I'm also an avid player of their games.
---
This feels... different. Sure, the scale is not as bad (~100 v ~800), but this feels almost personal. 
---
Seeing the many people whom I've grown to recognize over the past 6 years leave the company is weirdly heart-wrenching for me, as if a close friend is going away. And yet, I've never once interacted with these devs, and have only seen them through media posts and streams.
---
I haven't been playing the game much since ~April 2018, but I'm still no less devastated by this news, and equally concerned with how the game I've called home for the past ~6ish years is going to look like in the near future.
---
I truly wish those who are affected will find a new home soon. And with the immense amount of talent these people have, I'm confident they will.
---
(IDK where else to post this but I just needed to vent after looking at threads after threads of farewell :( )
---
GW1 was developed by WoW and WC3 developers. I wonder what would the talent that's leaving ANet accomplish. I'm thinking in a whole new IP
---
NCsoft let Wildstar live long beyond it being profitable.

ArenaNet may be back open then, but methinks we won't know if the  release cadence/roadmap is affected for awhile.
---
Incredibly scary?they just went one step short of outright shutting the game down.
---
Most likely the only reason they didn't is because they wait to cash in on the expansion.
---
GW2: 14,765 hrs.  GW1: ~8k hrs (can't check right now, at work)

I love GW as a franchise.  If the game starts to turn downward because of this, I can say I had a ton of fun, put my mouse down and walk away from the game with sorrow that it didn't survive longer.  I hope the game goes on.  I hope it stays great.  And I hope that every Dev who has been here for the ride goes on the bigger and better projects.  Love you guys/gals, its been a blast playing.  I hope to see you in game from time to time.  
---
Also, from what I've heard, their network coding is also poorly done, they can't even connect 2 data centers that are like meters away from each other.

Gw2 services. Aka the game will keep running. They never said not gw2. 
---
This reminded me of Monty Python for some reason. Thanks for the laugh :)
---
True, but the way she came to that conclusion was pretty funny
---
&gt;They pulled everything out of their ass. That is how writing fiction works. Of course, in this case they pulled it out of their ass at approximately the same time they did the same with sylvari as a whole.
---
That's not what he meant and you know it. ArenaNet spent so much time counteracting the notion and creating contradictions, that in all honesty, to this day the sylvari barely function or seem like dragon minions.
---
Such as the fact that dragon minions are mindless, sylvari are not. Dragon minions consume magic naturally, sylvari do not. Dragon minions have a hive mind, sylvari do not (and no, the Dream is not a hive mind nor is every sylvari connected to the Dream (see: Malyck)). I could go on, in all honesty.
---
&gt;Everything about the nightmare in the original plot points towards a hidden nefarious side. The creation story, with the dark seed guarded by evil plants, points towards a nefarious side.
---
And yet the Nightmare has been proven to be unrelated to, even fighting against, Mordremoth. Unlike other dragon minions, the Nightmare Court was early established to be fighting Elder Dragons and their minions just as those who follow the Dream do.
---
Also, nothing ever actually said the seed was dark (in fact, lore established with the core game outright confirmed that it couldn't be, since Ventari and Ronan never purified it; and no, nurture and the power of love and friendship cannot purify a dragon minion - which is yet another case that countered the argument, as the argument that sylvari=dragon minions was based on the notion that, like Glint, the Pale Tree betrayed Mordremoth of her own devices, this coming from a misconception originating from Edge of Destiny where Glint's words suggests it was her own ability, but we learned this was incorrect in Arah dungeon and that she was only ever able to betray Kralkatorrik due to the purification ritual). Nor was it ever stated that the plant monsters were evil or hostile - especially since Malyck is neither.
---
Established lore from Arah established that the cave could not be full of mordrem still subservient to Mordremoth.
---
&gt;Everything I just said comes from Sylvari personal story, pre-launch lore bombs, stories, and books, or The Crucible of Eternity. It is literally crazy to say the mordrem idea wasn't telegraphed enough to make sense.
---
And yet, the only thing that you said that was actually a proper hint, was the existence of nightmare hounds and summoned husks in Crucible of Eternity. Which itself could be handwaved as the Inquest guessing and being wrong, in all honesty.
---
The fact of the matter is that the idea was indeed not telegraphed properly, because there was a dozen more contradictions - contradictions that, I repeat, still exist to this day - that make the notion of sylvari being dragon minions seem incorrect.
---
ArenaNet simply put so much effort in trying to counter the theory before it sprung up, that they made contradictions for the reveal and the theory sprung up for all the wrong reasonings anyways.
---
&gt;considering the speculation about the mordremoth connection started well before launch, you can't say it doesn't make sense. 
---
ArenaNet claims that it was the plan from day 1 of conceptualizing the sylvari, but theorycrafting about the sylvari being dragon minions didn't begin until after launch, because it began once we found out that there was a sixth Elder Dragon. And, as said, it began under the false notion that dragon minions can willingly betray their Elder Dragons because of EoD's account of Glint betraying Kralkatorrik that omitted important details. And the false notion that dragon minions cannot be corrupted by other Elder Dragons (we know this isn't true, thanks to CoE no less; and S2&amp;HoT promotions confirmed it was the Dream that prevented corruption).
---
  
---
TL;DR the theorycrafting reached the correct outcome, but had all the wrong foundations. And the reveal remains contradictory.
---
Why? They’re not that much harder than Arah 2012 and fractals or the harder stuff from gw1.
---
NCSoft will remove gold-&gt;gem conversion. To sweeten the deal all items in the gem store get a 25% price cut.
---
If you're sitting on thousands of gold convert everything to gems asap (before March sales inflate the conversion rate).

wait what?

---
now i panic
---
It's completely mixed from what I can tell. Some like A. Linde and Ben Arnold were voluntary but many were not. There is no qay to tell because obviously not everyone is publicising it.
---
At the moment it feels like noone is safe, and many may still be in limbo, not knowing it they have a job tomorrow.
---
If SAB was available year round, I'd probably play it, didn't even really touch it the last time it was up
---
This is just the beginning isnt it...I fear for this game
---
The slow and agonizing development cycle that yielded nothing, coupled with long droughts and unfocused narrative is going to kill this game
---
GW2 was built on the idea of innovating the MMO genre, to keep it fresh and ahead of the curve, to keep players coming back for something new - but holy hell do I only come back when a new story comes out
---
This company is bleeding talent, and I hope its being replaced.
---
sent you a PM
---
I mean that was the quote from the NCsoft ceo not something ArenaNet said
---
I wonder are class balance programmers getting fired/changed? not trying to blame or hate 'em, but anet really could use some  fresh air (pun intended) into PvE DPS and sPVP overall balance.
---
anet doesn't have a fixed balance team really, patches are down with a hand full of people every few months from other teams
---
Was this an episode Jessica price worked on?
---
Hopefully they stop wasting time on making content 0.0001% of the player base does then.
---
So run by me again how the layoffs will make NCSoft want to strengthen the game?
---
Layoffs are always a bad sign.  In this case it just pushes the idea more that the game is into maintenance mode.
---
Yes, that's what they said, but it's hard to know what the impact of that on the running of the company will actually be. Mergers are never clean.
---
CMs aren't even hard though, they up boss HP and at most modify/add one new mechanic. 
---
up to you. If you want to follow the story, it's core-&gt;season 1-&gt;season 2-&gt;HoT-&gt;season 3-&gt;PoF-&gt;season 4-&gt;season 5 (upcoming)
---
You could also choose to completely skip the story and just get the elite specs set up since you've hit level 80 and have both expansions. 
---
Not a chance.  The highest likelihood is a switch to low-cost maintenance mode and second highest is a closure, probably in that order.  If it hasn't been profitable enough to *grow* (not just retain workers, but hire additional), the cutbacks are a crystal clear sign it's been marked for death.
---
Too bad there won't be refunds for the gems bought before the shutdown.

30k+ hours in gw1, not sure how many in gw2
---
She looks mesmerized.
---
It is easier to screw a system than fix it just by rattling it.
---
This the kind of guy who screams at the screen in unranked pvp.
---
Yes, and while that is sad, it is typical of industry; not just the video game industry. I'm just not sure where people are getting off claiming ANet was deliberately lying about not laying off GW devs still actively working on GW. Does anyone have evidence that any one person for sure laid off was actively working on a GW1 or GW2 team? Honest question; if yes, then ANet wasn't being honest, if no, then people are freaking out on the wrong people.
---
Finding out what's next is the scary part. Medium chance some content I like to do now and then when I feel like may not be produced anymore.
---
lets hope he wasn't the one one who worked for alliance update for WvW...
---
fractals are my fave content in game. and Ben gave us lots of insights on the current fractals, bugs if any, or give us hope into the new ones, etc. i don't know what to feel about now. hmm 
---
/salute - I've turned away so you won't see my tears.

I beg your pardon, but this is nearly solely to Gale's inquisition the official forums are ded. No AMAs and such - also her fail.

"You played a total of 2,984 hours across all characters"
---
Sixteen characters, majority charr. 
---
Looking forward to the world stories to come, despite today's somber tone.
---
Those GW1 memories are mine as well. They were incredibly special.
---
THIS.  People need to support the many devs who are still on the team, still working hard.  We don’t know all the details going on and GW2 is still one of the most popular MMOs.  MMOs that have died in the past only had a fraction of GW’s player base.  Hell, GW1 is still going and was even recently updated! 
---
And with that banger of an ending to the last Living Story episode, you really think they’re going to leave it at that? 
---
This is not the time to abandon ship.  Anet still needs you and I guarantee none of you have done EVERYTHING there is to do in the game while we wait for new content.  So, maybe try some PvP if you mostly PvE, or do some fractals if you mostly WvW, or start a new character, go after that legendary weapon you’ve been wanting, get gud at a mini game, or simply wander aimlessly around the maps and take in the details, doing events you’ve never done before just to see how they unfold.  
---
Take this time to change things up, and find something new to enjoy about this amazing game.  I’ve played since beta and I still haven’t done half of what’s available.  Don’t give up :) 
---
To be fair, those things wouldn't have been unrealistic if they weren't siphoning off all of their talent to work other projects.
---
They had no problem releasing at least as many gem store weapon skins.
---
5700h. I love this game 
---
Sorta, the ultimate raids are completely separate from the other ones rather than being the same raid but more difficult, they're usually their own very challenging boss fight.
---
This is a sad day. May all of you be remembered!

In our company when we let people go our managers ask "Does anyone want to be made redundant?" at which point a rushing wind sound is heard as people run to form a queue at the manager's office door to get their redundancy payout.
---
If ever I make it to the door first I'll be getting over $150,000 ($100k USD) in my redundancy payout (because I've worked at my company for 18 years).  That's how it works in Australia anyway.  Not sure if American companies have good redundancy/severance payouts but when you get offered a 6 figure carrot to switch out of a job you may already hate then you take it!
---
Will try and make it :)
---
McKenna is a she and I don't think she's worked on WvW for months.
---
That's not gonna save you bub
---
3,842 hours over 2,364 days. I met my boyfriend of 3 years thanks to Guild Wars 2 - he had a WoW Horde pin on his backpack and I asked him if he played GW2 as well. I showed off my commander tag to woo him. We play all the story missions together.
---
Wishing the team strength and fortitude in this difficult time.
---
So after some of the people layed off were big members of the team that actively worked on the game, do you still think people should not panic?
---
Necro does good condi cleanse with blood magic middle gm trait, death magic middle minor trait, offhand dagger 4, staff 4, spectral walk, consume conditions, curses 1st minor middle trait and plague signet, 
---
If its open world then you can just run death magic 111 with minion and never worry about conditions.
---
Pvp you can run sceptre/dagger and staff with spectral walk and blood magic middle gm trait and consume conditions.
---
In WvW, no class can deal with the amount of power and condi damage thrown around. You are better off as damage dealer and hope support keeps you alive.

/Salute

I consider beating some of this man’s most fiendish jumping puzzles to be my most worthwhile achievements in GW2. I almost wish he could take Super Adventure Box with him so he could possibly finish his vision for that minigame...
---
Tbh, I would love this notification. Lets me know I have successfully completed my mission lol
---
You have been playing for 36,982.533 hours. Please take a break.
---
dang really? when I last played it (long time ago) had like 40-50 spells by max level. 
---
Guess no hope for wvw anymore. Another game killed by Ncsoft. Honestly. 
---
Seems Ben P is safe Jawgeous posted in pvp discord
---
you sound like a person who has a lot of money, and is condescending due to that
---
This was my first reply in the thread and I simply offered a link to training discords if you or anyone else was curious. I haven't said anything about Easy Mode in raids so I don't know how I came across as fighting it. 
---
+1
---
Hey, any devs swinging by the page, just wanted to let you know I have loved your game all these years, and I wish you all the best in times to come. Sorry to hear this has happened, but I am grateful for all the fun you have given me.
---
The decision for the layoffs came from the publisher, NCSoft, not Arenanet, the game developer.
---
Completely disagree.  Every industry I've been in unions would be a death sentence to our wages and our workforce.  No thank you.
---
There are a lot of industries that could use unions, but the video game industry isn't one of them.  Business would be very very badly hurt.  Major companies would downsize even more as costs rose and India companies would be pretty well fucked by inability to afford the cost of entry into the space.
---
Sorry, I appreciate the help. I just mean to say that people seem to be against Easy Mode but the current solution if recommending training groups isn't pulling enough people to increase the raid community.
---
What about Bill Freist and Stephen Clarke-Willson?
---
How much?
---
Jesus, why is this community so sjwish.
---
&gt;raids are casual
---
Then why do raid lfg have barriers? Just take all if it's so easy.
---
Wait, this is for real? I’ve got a complete home node collection, but never did this. Time to do some Googling...
---
we didn't realy got much for WvW tho, are they even any devs working directly on WvW?
---
I feel like things are going to be rough this year.  Lots of good employees gone, delayed updates, friends still at the company in shock.  I could really see them going several months before pushing any substantial updates.  Then there is no telling what will happen.  Do they push LW5 and keep the same content going?  Do they push other PvE content such as raids?  What about the future for PvP or WvW?  It would be really sad to see things end this way but I don't think that's the case.
---
I think they need a GW3 to drag people back into the franchise. Otherwise, the game will just lose more and more players. In order to keep GW1 and 2 relevant. They could add a system where things you do in those games can be transferred into GW3 like currency or tokens. And its not a one time thing. But a constant thing as you switch between games. lol. 
---
 I wish I could unsee this :(
---
Hasn't it occurred to you that perhaps it's YOUR understanding that's simplistic? Unlike you, gamers understand that this "simple logic" of boycotting something they don't like is too simplistic for games. That's why they don't follow it.
---
If someone was to boycott GW2, what message exact would Anet draw from it? Do they not like the game? Do they not like the genre? Do they not like our implementation of the genre? Do they not like the company? Do they like the game and the company but disagree with something else we did?
---
That's why gamers complain rather than boycott. And it works. There is no group of customers on this planet that is able to make a company do 180° like a bunch of angry gamers. It's NORMAL CUSTOMERS who should be getting a clue and emulating gamers.
---
Even F2P, you're looking at 100+ hours easily. I'll wager you wont be dissapointed.
---
While I wasn't really a fan of the story, the music was always amazing in the game. That one strikes me the most
---
Ah, for a moment I thought this was meant to be a complete list since I saw one of the composers who had left all the way back in 2016. I had no idea she worked in S4.
---
You also seem to have more information on Ree? I always wanted to know more, but her social media and websites seemed abandoned. When I tried the forums, I got suspended for talking about an employee even though all I wanted to know was why she had left in the first place. I quite enjoyed the Sea of Sorrows novel and her take on the sylvari.

I've been playing since the re-launch and can probably count on one hand the number of times I've ever realistically run into a "care bear" situation.  It's really easy to find groups that are more serious about the content and want to clear and put in the work.  Sure, if you PUG everything it'll take longer as you sort through folks, but even with PUGs people eventually end up either sorting themselves out or they don't progress past the first few tiers and are no longer an issue for those that are going higher.
---
ArenaNet is a wholly owned subsidiary of NCSoft. So this is not like Bungie breaking off with Blizzard Activision as they didn't own the IP to Destiny. NCSoft owns everything. 
---
Does NCSoft own the guild wars license at this point?
---
where there any devs working directly on WvW to begin with?
---
She was gone way before it.
---
actually it was d2 devs. Probably WC3 as well, but wow and GW1 were in development practically parallel. Infact i think WoW came out after GW1 did.
---
Its a core issue of publicly traded companies. If you're privately owned as long as you're paying your taxes, employees and have some money in case something goes wrong or you decide to grow, really all you have to do is make sure you're happy with the company and its direction.
---
Its once you start having to bow to people who aren't you that you start running into problems. Once you have to start answering to shareholders and investors that rampant greed and unsustainable growth become problems.
---
Take Blizzard in the late 90's/early 2000's. They didn't have this issue. They just made games they'd love to play and they knew we'd love to play. Look at Vanilla WoW. It was made by gamers, for gamers, to be a great game. Then the Acti-blizz merger happened and now its all about monetization and keeping that growth happening. They released Overwatch to massive commercial success, and Activision demanded that Blizzard implement Overwatch's terrible monetization system into Heroes of the Storm, getting rid of the decent system in place.
---
If Developers would stop selling out to AAA corporations we wouldn't have this problem. Look at Undertale. Undertale doesn't have lootboxes, season passes, absurd Silver, Gold, Platinum, Complete and Super Complete editions. It was just a game that a guy loved making and he shared it with us hoping we'd love playing it as much as he loved making it. He didn't have to keep unsustainable growth going.
---
But I agree that its a problem with corporate life. Gaming companies shouldn't be corporate. It ruins the point of games.
---
Arena Net was doing their own publishing for GW2 and they decided to work on two dead end projects for however many years. 
---
“Guild Wars 2 *services* will be unaffected.” They chose those words for a reason 
---
[/age](https://imgur.com/kaZyfQI)  \- 22,390 hours in Gw2 in total  
---
I haven't played Gw1 for any decent length of time but I've been with Gw2 since launch. Of all the time I spent with Gw2 it's helped me connect and become apart of some wonderful communities and make some great friends. Hang in there Anet!
---
Unions yes, but I feel like th co-op model would be better. Incredible what you can do when you don't have to send most of your profits to shareholders who don't even works for the company.
---
If GW2 is profitable, Anet could buy back the franchise from NCSoft and switch the company models to a co-op. This way all the profits stay within the workers and the game.
---
Being profitable enough to pay dividends to shareholders vs. enough to pay your people is two different thresholds. 
---
This is the problem with corporations - the people in charge are no longer in the business of selling whatever it is the company makes, instead they're in charge of selling stocks.
---
This is how wealth creation works under capitalism. You extract value from a bunch of people until you've completely tapped the resource, then you move on to another.
---
The only real way to not have this happen is to operate under a different system. Otherwise, this is exactly what happens with anything people like - be it a game, be it youtube or discord, or whatever. It all serves the bottom line, not the quality or integrity of the product.
---
/salute    
---
I have 7k hours in GW1 and 13k in Gw2, and I find the GW2 combat a lot more fluid, and enjoyable.
---
I think GW1's fun was all in the build craft before the actual engagement. The literal engagement itself was just following the skill setup according to plan, while GW2 is moment to moment decisions on kiting, no port spotting, reacting with dodges etc. If GW2 had GW1's level of customisability (which it would have a decent crack at provided more trait options/skills could compete), it would be the superior combat hands down. Heck, even now I am very much in the camp it is.
---
I very much just enjoy the PvE aspects of ESO, which is new for me as I was a largely PvP player in GW2. I like how gritty and modest the PvE can feel in ESO. I haven't seen any infusion ridden eyesore yet so that is a plus!
---
I don't particularly want to wade into a big discussion of the pros and cons of unionization.  That said, I don't see how unionization would have done anything whatsoever about the current situation.
---
Who?
---
The words mean nothing, the service WILL still be affected unless they meant it as "you can still log in, play and give us money, so yeah, it's unaffected.
---
I'll be there, just as I said on Twitter.
---
Too soon, man.
---
NCSoft\*
---
Yikes. I find it hard to believe slashing a quarter of the company will have no effect on Guild Wars 2 development. Hope all those effected find jobs soon...
---
They get 2 months paid leave and are not in band standing with the industry.
---
So GW mobile got shelved.  I play enough mobile games that this doesn't affect me.  If players were waiting a long time for it, then they rightfully should panic... for GW mobile.
---
GW2 still has staff, and they said the current layoffs don't affect the game and story.
---
Exactly my thoughts! Thats the only thing I want in GW2 besides... the profession dancing and the "Duel spec" aspect of GW1. I miss being able to mix and match skills from different classes so bad.
---
HEIL HIDLAR 😂👌🏿🙌🏿🙅🏿‍♂️🤙🏿🌚
---
How would you have a contingency plan for you parent company, who’s been fairly hands-off for years, suddenly coming in and saying ‘you have a week to get rid of a quarter of your employees’? Heck, they probably didn’t even get that much information, just ‘you’re laying off people and we haven’t decided how many yet, we’ll tell you by the end of your week timeline’.
---
 /salute
---
Especially when you lose big parts of the raid and fractal teams 
---
It already has. The only way ANET could release less content at this point is if they actually didn't release anything at all.
---
I'm not saying this out of hate for Anet, I have been invested in the Guild Wars IP for 14-15 years. We just need to recognise that they really have been dropping the ball in the past 1-2 years.
---
&gt;ArenaNet stated last week that Guild Wars 2 will not be affected by the layoffs and that Living World Season 4 and Season 5 are still scheduled and nothing has changed. As of right now there is no reason to doubt this information.
---
Kappa
---
At its core, that’s exactly what it means. At its most basic, if the game doesn’t shut down, which it hasn’t, then that statement holds true. They couldn’t say GW2 will be unaffected because they would have no clue how the game itself will traverse this event.
---
Grats for being dumb and not looking at WHO is getting removed since they include people actively working on the game and story.
---
did he leave recently or was it long ago since he was working for anet?
---
I've been through a corporate downsizing/layoff twice in my career.
---
Both times, the process involved shutting the site down a day or three while you break people up into small groups or pair them up individually with managers who then break the news to them one way or another.  
---
For the people who are let go, this typically involves an overview of any severance package offered and what your rights are in terms of unemployment, COBRA benefits etc.
---
This can take several minutes per person to go through, and in both instances where I got to see this happen first hand, the allotted time per session was 30 minutes.
---
If you assume Anet is doing something similar for the entire staff, that is most likely several hours of time blocked out just for the process of informing people of whether or not they have a job.
---
Once that process is over.  There will almost certainly be some sort of organization-wide discussion about "What does the new org chart look like?  Who reports to what groups going forward?  What are the new priorities especially for the people who were working on projects that just got cancelled."
---
It isn't at all unreasonable to think that they'll spend the vast majority of the next 2 days going through the actual mechanics of laying people off and communicating the new structure to the people who remain.
---
There are certainly many other ways to handle this type of thing.  I'm sure people have written books on the subject and studied it extensively.  But what Anet is doing doesn't seem at all outlandish based on my previous experiences in the professional world.
---
Nah, this is not too soon. Spot on accurate with the amount of layoffs and volunteers...
---
Thanks for the clear concise overview.
---
Dark days, look around.. the gaming industry in general seems to be in shambles one way or another. Disappointing. Hopefully those devs will find a place to call home and that everyone can move forward. Time will tell.
---
The layoffs did but handling it falls firmly on anets shoulders. They are not to be blamed for the layoffs but they are to be blamed for having this cause a potential PR nightmare for themselves
---
Baaash the dragon! Baaash the dragon!

Wait no fuck the world is ending. Stop. DON'T BASH THE DRAGON. STOP IT. NOOOO

---
OH wow, I never seen this video before! Thanks for linking it. :D
---
Thank you.  Most of the way to the precursor then?
---
Do you have a lin to exactly what is in the garden?
---
We definitely know Ben was working on fractals and raids
---
Yup. You can like or dislike a company, but they honestly could not give less of a shit unless you spend money or don't. If you care enough to spend money when you are not getting what you want, then you are only a useful idiot for them. Doubly so if you convince others to be useful idiots.
---
Almost like it's different people giving different opinions.
---
OMG YES! I love this video. I love their interaction. The whole segment is very funny. :D
---
Then I heard the update is delayed cuz of this lay off happening
---
Given that GW2 is nearly 7 years old now, they need to find a way to make money. If they are relying solely on GW2 then they are fucked. I’ve been really surprised the past couple of years hearing they had stuff they were working on but still hadn’t released. I see why now, but they really need to find a new revenue stream if they hope to stay afloat. A company can’t survive forever on just one or two products.
---
Open World PvP is something that would get me playing regularly again, I won't lie.
---
You guys constantly bringing her up and talking shit about her are the vengeful ones.  Move on ffs.
---
Given the seniority of many of those leaving that will have an effect regardless.
---
Yes
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama is not allowed.
---
What's depressing is that some people have been at that company for more than 15 years and not even they were safe. What does that do for the morale of the remaining employees?
---
All the employees that were there during this layoff round will never feel safe in Anet from now on and I wouldn't be surprised if they started looking for alternate employment with companies who feel more secure.
---
Ok hopefully they get more people now that they got little under 300 people working on GW2
---
I'm sure Mr. Johannson wouldn't mind working with some of his old colleagues

---
I treat the eastern game market with extreme cynicism and caution. It's pretty much an entire industry full to the brim of EAs and Activisions. Every subsidiary is another point of profit for them, they're not in the business of making games for people to have fun, they're in it for maximum profits. That's why predatory and shady systems like the "VIP" system were added to GW2 China, because that's what eastern players expect from an MMO; pay-to-win, predatory practices, and so they're likely to buy into it and be a source of profit. Last time a game in the west did that, it generated the most downvoted post in Reddit history.
---
So it's easy to see why NCSoft laid off almost 1/4 of ArenaNet, even though GW2 is their most successful game in the west. They probably figured if they axed a few projects and employees they could crank that much more profit out of the game. Employees are tools and players are profit. Which is why as of now I'm not planning on buying the next GW2 expansion (if it even ever gets announced...) unless the game moves to a new publisher, because I won't tolerate this bullshit from EA and Activision, and I'm not going to tolerate it from NCSoft either.
---
YUUUANNGHHH FUCKING NCSOSOFT = MAXIMUM CUNTS 🙅🏿‍♂️
---
Let's be honest, it's because of the GW2 rewards you get from GW1.
---
DPS rotations is why i don't want to raid. and enrage timers should be removed as they add nothing other than an arbitrary DPS gate. being able to do tons of damage shouldn't be the only valuable skill needed. someone can be garbage at DPS but excellent in preparation, positioning and dodging.
---
skill in encounters should come from preparation, on the fly tactics, positioning and avoiding attacks. not you memorized a bunch of button presses in a specific order.
---
would removing enrage make raids easier? yes but it would also remove the main source as to why people cant get into raids without sacrificing any of the mechanical complexity.
---
She was in charge of in-game rewards recently. 
---

---
It's a fucking killing field.
---
What's changed is the new breed of immature and entitled gamer bois.  
---
Well, there was speculation that Anet only has as few as 100 ppl still even working on Gw2, so if they only laid off 100 of 400, and Gw2 is now the only thing they're working on, other than the fact that some people who were currently creating stuff for Gw2 might not be there anymore, we will "hopefully" see an increase in development for the game. Trying real hard to be hopeful right now. It's not easy.
---
Move on? A quick look at your history shows you are literally obsessed with her. Move on ffs 🙄
---
I mean, lets face it. They were the ones actually putting out updates unlike the majority of the team.
---
“Game services” - you can still log into the game, you can still buy and sell gems, the trading post isn’t down, the log-in, chat and map servers are up. The website and forums are running, the game can be played normally.
---
There is currently no planned cancellation of any upcoming game content. (Note: plans may always change, postponing or delays != cancellation.)
---
Reading between the lines is always important when dealing with PR statements. It’s just the most truthful, positive spin they can say at that moment to calm things down while many things (including the job of the poster who wrote the statement) are still unknown.
---
Layoffs will always have an effect. Morale and culture-wise, on people leaving and people staying. People may voluntarily jump ship and give notice when they see the writing on the wall too, no statement is going to predict or preclude that.
---
At the end of the day, it’s about whether you still care to support those who are staying, while respecting those that are leaving. (Referring to devs -and- players.)
---
I see. Well I'm on much later than you it seems :( Feel free to add me though (in flair) and just pm if I'm on. Hopefully I'll be done with dailies by then. 
---
Doubt that will happen, it is still one of the top MMOs. Tech companies like to purge and rebuild after killing what they consider unsuccessful products or releases not up to snuff. I've been on the wrong end of that twice now and while it wasn't my fault, I got blamed for it multiple times (bugs in 3rd party software both times, thank you 3dFX and Microsoft).
---
I was going to say the same thing. I don't like to talk too too much about my RL matters in this subreddit, but my father works in the public sector. Anytime there's a shutdown, any portion of the government that's affected? All those employees are technically just laid off. Once the shutdown is lifted, they're back in their jobs.
---
(And for anyone who asks, no, my dad was unaffected by the recent shutdowns. He WAS briefly affected by the one in 2013.)
---
It's difficult to believe, I agree. Just sounds like corporate PR 101 to me. 
---
You don't get into raiding for gold
---
You *do* know that NCSoft lies, right? Maybe ANet doesn't, but NCSoft does.
---
I understand this worry completely.
---
While I'm upset to see many developers go, I hope that it will leave room for some new leaders to grow - hopefully ones who are more receptive to this sort of feedback, when possible.
---
Today's announcements would show that to have been a lie.
---
Sign up for Twitch Prime to get increased drop rates!

---
Strafing ftfy
---
Rest is understandable
---
Personally, yes I do not trust them, yet. They will gain my trust again once they show their will to create content that doesn't make the game look like it is in its EoL period. Until then, is it so wrong to trust the same devs who cucked over GW2 development for two unknown projects? Maybe later. 
---
Glad that the recent shutdown didn't touch you. We had quite a number of complications caused by it.
---
I actually work within the game industry and consult for a lot of large Korean mobile / PC gaming clients among other global gaming clients. I’ve seen countless times all marketing &amp; development support canceled without warning in the west due to low in-app, in-game purchases. Their design philosophies do not mesh with the American mindset, and I can’t imagine they’d be very supportive of Anets cosmetic &amp; convenience gem model.
---
No-one is stopping the world. ArenaNet are understandably closed for two days while layoffs happen. There is a short term disruption of releases (the warclaw delayed one week) and maybe a medium term disruption as they restructure their teams.
---
Everything happening atm is the best attempt to ensure GW2 continues as a healthy game while retaining as many employees as possible. People aren't machinery, managing the feelings and morale of ArenaNet employees, both those leaving and those remaining, is a top priority right now. That should be common sense for anyone with experience managing people.
---
There are indeed but what's the point of this statement? One could (and some do) create private raids for world bosses, bounties and various open world content.
---
It's not because they exist that it's the only way to play WvW or that it's even what we were talking about.
---
1/4th the company got laid off.. Panic out of hand? This can be a good thing you say?
---
Are you one of those people who was also pointing to Anet's statement that  gw2 services would not be affected?

Get real. I love this game but just because it was making (barely) money does not mean players were satisfied. Some of the staff lost (Josh and anet Ben) has literally been behind some of my favorite non PvP content. This game is as good as dead.
---
I swear there are too many young kids on this forum spewing nonsense on how impactful these lay offs actually are. 
---
Have you ever played any other NCSoft game before?  They are a seriously fucked up company and treat all players as sheep and employees like dirt and they have been like this since the beta of City of Heroes.  I despise NCSoft as they have screwed up every damn title they ever touch.
---
Which is what you knew before the layoffs were announced. You know when's a good time to announce new content like an expansion? Not in the middle of layoffs.
---
Being the business owner, here are the complications:
---
The older (in company terms) guys are expecting a raise despite their input. That is expected but not always reasonable.
---
Given the state of the last episodes, a lot of resources were spent on the beautiful and interesting maps that are hardly replayable. This was stated multiple months and times here but nobody really bothered with that. What you have in fact is a HUGE investment in arts and development but nobody really goes there while they have the proven effective rewarding things to do. This is totally unacceptable and hopefully wil get fixed.
---
NCSoft is not exactly known for talking to the community except to say "we're shutting your game down".

---
I know that's rookie numbers compared to the rest here but that is still, by far, the most number of hours I have spent in one single game. The next closest one is probably Warframe at ~500 hours.
---
Recent gw2 content was so bad ncsoft fired ppl from lineage

It's not about killing. It's about the post. We need more people in WvW and making such posts instead of trying to actually bring people in... is one of the things that make WvW unwelcoming.

Severance package.

The issue is money, there is passion and then there is reality.

Hi!. I m kinda new player here, who wants to earn some gold. Because of that i came to Istaan, on events and zerged with people about 4 hours. I ve done 2 Palavan 4 GH and about 6 Kiki and 2 Bobs and get \~200 blue \~100 green \~30yellow unidentified gear boxes, 30 filacteries and 3 trophy boxes for VM. After I sold on TP blue boxes, opened and disenchant green and yellow (68% of MF) and sold all resources on TP I've get about 27-28 gold in 4 hours. Is it really worth to goldfarm in this place?
---
The storyline was good. But if you consider the time spent on designing a new map and divide it by replayability - this is poor to be as polite as it is ever possible.
---
They fired people that were in Anet for 18 years...
---
Smaller staff, paid less, smaller games, more microstransactions, bigger profit percentage and total income...
---
In reality it will just mean that more people will end up going to indie games. 
---
I believe so.
---
I'm a dev in gaming and I do a lot of resume reviews, any devs at arenanet feel free to pm me.  I'm in the area, happy to share job info pointers as well.  Standing offer, no rush.  So sorry for everything you all are going through. 
---
Well as it turns that all that statement meant was that they weren't shutting down the game along with the layoffs
---
1,511 hours 21 minutes.
---
It's not as much as a lot of others but my time raiding in WvW with my guild is some of the best fun I've had in all of my gaming history, and even if we've disbanded and gone our separate ways I will always look back fondly on those days.
---
If in doubt, don't say it.
---
Arkk: lazer, slam, shock wave, ball 1 ball 2, blind, orb, cc, grav wave, platforms, bomb, green, pillars, 2 different mini boss adds, regular adds, each with their own mechanics, gladiator spin for example. 13 mech + 4 adds types + 3 instab. 
---
VG: green, blue, cc, floor, split, seekers, orbs, colour. 8 mechanics. 
---
If you are looking at mechanics, I think raids in this case is pretty easy lol. Plus you skip a bunch with meta strats anyways. 
---
For example, using skips, Gorse is literally: slam, black, blue, ghost, egg. 
---
So, other than LFG, raids are objectively easier than done fractal bosses. 
---
Just yesterday I was thinking it'd been ages since I'd seen her doing dailies, and I didn't see her during Lunar Festival either. Wonder if she knew something earlier.
---
Played both 1 and 2 a ton and loved both. Even if my interest has waned in recent years, y'all still made excellent games in a tough market. Something to be proud of, for sure. 
---
Yes, they can now focus on personal story which is 45 mins of non-repeatable content every 3-4 months :)) 
---
Alright, I feel like you have a lot of misconceptions about how raiding works that probably come from second or even third hand horror stories.
---
First, enrage timers don't figure into bosses at all. If everyone is doing even half-decent DPS the enrage timer won't get even close to expiring on all but a couple bosses. 
---
&gt; being able to do tons of damage shouldn't be the only valuable skill needed. someone can be garbage at DPS but excellent in preparation, positioning and dodging.
---
High DPS is valued for 3 reasons:
---
1. You kill boss faster
---
2. You get to skip certain mechanics
---
3. You don't do timed mechanics as often
---
The first and third reason are going to exist even if you remove enrage timers, because they're just based on time. If one group takes twice as long to do the fight, they are going to see twice as many timed mechanics. This creates a higher likelihood of failing, which is undesirable. Asking for high DPS will always be a thing (especially in PUGs) because it increases the speed and chance of killing the boss.
---
&gt; skill in encounters should come from preparation
---
It does, in the form of knowing how to deal a lot of damage/provide good boon uptimes/provide sufficient healing. If you consider gearing as well, that's some more preparation. Furthermore, knowing the fight is paramount to succeed. Especially for critical roles that have to complete mechanics.
---
&gt; on the fly tactics
---
Outside of straight RNG, there really isn't a way to enforce this. It occasionally comes into play when you have to salvage a misplay from someone.
---
&gt; positioning and avoiding attacks
---
Absolutely required. Sometimes the supports can shield/stab/heal through a mechanic or damage, but being able to position correctly allows supports to deal more damage (see above)
---
&gt; not you memorized a bunch of button presses in a specific order.
---
What else is the option? They can't make every spell deal the same damage in the same way, otherwise weapons/skills/traits wouldn't mean anything. Rotations are designed so that the most X is being accomplished (usually damage) over a set time. During an actual raid, you may have to adjust this depending on if there is a split soon, or if you have to do a mechanic, or whatever. Rotations exist because they are optimal, and *something* will always be optimal.
---
&gt; would removing enrage make raids easier? yes but it would also remove the main source as to why people cant get into raids without sacrificing any of the mechanical complexity.
---
It's very very rare to end up on enrage if people aren't failing mechanics left and right.
---
Shattered observatory is pretty universally acknowledged as much harder than the other however many T4s though - I bet some of the raid bosses are easier but the majority of the fractals are pretty easy.
---
Josh, Peter, and Gaile gone... just Rubi left, and I think we may never get to know what's going on in the castle.
---
Yeah, I suppose you're not wrong.
---
Man this graph is so bad lol. That vertical scale is so wonky. 
---
o7
---
One thing I know is that they better shape up the 300 to make up the work for the 100 they just lost.. in experience, in skill, but most of all, in passion for the game.
---
The only positive light if we truly squeeze it is that to have someone a Dev that actually plays the game to communicate with the player base and understand what the community is asking in lieu make a profitable product to secure sales numbers.
---
*Cough cough* make outfits separate pieces, make PvP more watchable (less spammy skills, and reduce LoD blinding flash), no bandwagoning WvW.
---
Should be interesting to see what the company is/goes over the next few months.  A lot of talented people are out including some leads of teams.  This is going to be a big adjustment for the company.  The direction might not change for LW season 4 or 5 releases but what's after that?  They will obviously have to shift development direction or suffer more layoffs.  Hopefully we get some kind of road-map (wishful thinking) and a message from MO next week.
---
Scrybe, we're gonna miss ya :(  I don't think the wold has your equal.
---
/F
---
Just means it has to come from a private company/studio
---
I am not sure why you care about statements and plans from sources you don't trust.
---
Except ncsoft came to fix the mess at anet, not to revitalize gw2. If they believed in anet they wouldnt be cancelling their projects this way
---
Raid in exotic armor BiS everything else. Weapon is achievement, backpack is achievement, ring amu ear lw3. Enjoy. 
---
They were originally lined up as separate graphs, not meant to compare games to each other, but games now to their previous quarters.
---
You are such a joy to be toyed with
---
I personally don’t use it as a friends list - most of my friends list is either Anet devs or commanders I like (for HP trains or bounty trains or metas). My friends are usually in the same guild as me so no reason to “double” it. 
---
Aion still exists? That abomination of god?
---
&gt; I'm leveling my guardian so I can have a kickass firebrand in PvP.
---
That is unnecessary since you get all the stuff unlocked and stats come from the amulet only.
---
i read negative comments but i feel like this wont be the end of guild wars 2. maybe it will be better if anet focus on gw2 only and leave other projects (mobile one maybe.)
---
for a long time i dont feel like anet giving attention on gw2 enough. wvw, pvp players are in riot for years and they just did a wvw mount over years.
---
also there is no action for new expansion. living stories wont be able to keep community alone it self.
---
you think surely sad about laid offs, but when you look the current status of gw2, some refreshment and focusing on gw2 may do things better, at least for players.
---
business life is not a joke.
---
This almost sounds like a copypasta lmao
---
2/3 of the web team doesn't mean it's only the API. Web involves more than that.

Close to 300 people isn't maintenance mode.

At the time World of Warcraft was release, Blizzard hard Starcraft, Diablo and the the Warcraft RTS. They had multiple franchises under their built and were actively working on other games (Diablo 3 was in development for around a decade, including a completely scrapped version of the game before the current one was made).
---
World of Warcraft is actually the result of Blizzard branching out from a successful title and developing multiple new franchises rather than just sticking with what works.
---
Since WoW released Blizzard also released Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm.
---
Let me rephrase it real quick, I'm waiting for their plans and seeing if they follow through.
---
Alot of experienced raiders raid in full exotic on there alt accounts. If you do your work and practice your rotation on the golem you can easily out dps most players in full ascended. 
---
Sure. Since 2013 anet had 4 mobile teams (confirmed in one of the interviews) and in original kotaku article anout lay offs i5 was directly mentioned they are stepping in due to lack of releases in 2018 and 2019. 
---
Now this is something that will literally never ever happen unless ArenaNet publishes the source themselves
---
Yeah I was extremely confused how can 80 unit can be taller than 120.

5k hours. Thanks for making my teenage years bearable anet &lt;3

How about you wait for the people to clear out their desks before deciding the rest of the company will go too? 
---
They have to look in the armory. That's where he's likely to be.
---
&gt; How will GW2 not be affected with fewer developers working on it? Is that not a contradictory statement in itself?
---
No-one said GW2 will have fewer developers working on it. You've made that up.
---
Wait, so I get firebrand when I go into PvP lobbies?
---
ArenaNet and all of its assets and IP are owned by NCsoft.
---
Money makes most myopic.
---
It's certain alright. You don't keep 200 plus people on payroll with the plans to fire them later. That's just wasting money. And a roadmap is and will always be a terrible idea, and I don't even know why people want one. Evidently it's not reassuring that the game will continue. They've already said that and clearly people don't care.
---
It's a mixture of both. What is unknown is how many employees will be moved back onto GW2 (if any at all) and what the total number of employees working on GW2 will be when the layoffs are finished.
---
Anyone claiming to know the answer to this is making shit up. It's possible ArenaNet will have more people developing GW2 next week than it did three months ago.
---
Yes you do. They need to keep the game alive and monetize it as long as its profitable.
---
Not sure I want to go to a brothel and have my choice pulled due to seniority
---
I am a new player level 23 and want to purchase an expansion I can only afford 1 at the moment which one would be the most beneficial to buy?
---
What was publicly stated was that there were layoffs, side projects were cancelled, and that the plans for upcoming GW2 content was not being impacted. The bad assumption that I was responding to was that one should interpret this as "employees whose jobs were tied to side projects are gone and employees whose jobs were tied to GW2 are safe."
---
That was a terrible assumption to make. You don't lay off a good dev because they were working on a failed project, and you don't keep a bad dev because they were on a successful project. This should not in anyway be misconstrued to mean I think the people who got laid off were bad devs. All I'm saying is that canning devs based on the project they were working on is bad business.
---
&gt;You're also assuming that creatives can just be replaced with other creatives and that's not really true. The product changes.
---
Of course. I'm not assuming that the layoffs won't impact GW2 in any way. That would be silly. What I'm saying is devs have left GW2 before (some of your faves actually probably have been working on other things for a while now, (obviously not Ben)), and I'm sure that more will leave in the coming months. New devs have and will possibly be hired and/or veterans will be moved around to fill the gaps.
---
You're welcome to judge upcoming content however you like. Hell, be extra critical. I just think it's really shitty to all the people who are still there to bash it here and now. Way to set them up to fail. Was Ben great? Absolutely. He'll be sorely missed. That doesn't mean that whoever takes over his role won't be great too though.
---
Devs are people, and each brings their own individuality to their projects. Ultimately, though, it's a team effort. When you lose a team member you do the best to fill their shoes with someone else and keep going. The race isn't over yet.
---
As a WvW veteran there is absolutely no reason to support this game for at least 4 years. The mount bullshit discourages to that even more. Sadly, it's definitely the time to find new one. 
---
I think those that have been with the company for a long time got an offer for a new contract for less pay, some took the offer and some didnt.
---
He injected a bit of much needed cruelty into an often trivially smooth ride of a game.  I loved him for it!  Kind of like he sprinkled a bit of Dark Souls into Guild Wars except with jump puzzles instead of hard bosses.
---
It's pretty insane that right now is when they are having the biggest membership numbers in their lifetime. Not even back in the 06/07 days, the numbers now are higher. All thanks to OSRS Mobile

Guess it's time to shelf the WvW versus PvE spat for now and focus on what's important. 
---
I liked Trahearne...
---
These devs are also needed to prepare maintanance mode systems if they decides mot to continue with the development. Unless anet announces at least 1 expac soon we can prepare for the end.

Damn this post is the one that got me... thanks for all your hard work Devs, I've enjoyed every minute of content.

[4,4k hours](https://i.imgur.com/2bHUUXt.png) in GW 1

[14,4k hours](https://i.imgur.com/HSGxuDb.png) in GW 2

Started way back in 2005 when I was only 11. Couldn't invest too many hours back then but I still loved the game. The soundtrack still holds so many memories for me (same goes for GW 2). Come 2012 and jump onto GW 2.
---
Met so many aweome people through my guild, even IRL. Invested so many hours during 2015-2017 when I was unemployed. Did everything in the game I could (except WvW). Even went back to GW 1 to finish GWAMM which I never dreamt of accomplishing as a kid. [Achievement hunting was one of my favorite pastimes](https://i.imgur.com/0YzN0nn.png)
---
Needless to say these games will always have a special place in my heart.
---
*waves to fellow ex-web teamer*
---
I've never even stepped foot in a raid for GW2. Did that stuff in WoW, and no I am not a WoW player. I came from GW1. Tbh, raids take too much time, and as a GW2 vet I already knew a long time ago that greater time spent in game does not equal better rewards.
---
Raids were the spelling of doom for GW2. Most Vets left either prior or right after HoT. One of the reasons why is that Anet was going to yet again add another system 'raids' ontop of everything else we had that was already going down the tube in quality. Which is why we are here in the first place. Anet mishandling the quality of their game, and now we know why. "[we have been putting resources from GW2 to other projects]"
---
A little background: I've spent thousands of hours in game, the majority of it with my Wife. When we were long distance GW1 was our major couple activity. GW2 released around the time we got married, and it's always been there as a stay at home play with the family activity.
---
The idea of it dying off is... Odd. It would likely be my last MMORPG, which I hate the idea of. But nothing else I have tried fits. I don't really know how I feel about that.
---
CoH was also riddled with legal troubles.
---
for general gameplay, probably PoF. You get the mount, and the expansion content is easier than in HoT
---
That being said, HoT has more repeatable content available, but the maps are also more difficult. 
---
Assuming game industry works like other IT industry businesses, if you volunteer during layoffs with a lot of experience under your roof you get a really good severance package.
---
There's a chance that the veterans leaving are doing this because they want to ensure that newer employees hold their positions, while they'll be fine with the severance they're given.
---
I think gaming is being soft-divided into three categories based on greed vs passion.
---
- Live services/AAA games(microtransactions, lootboxes, pre-order pushes, release early fix later practices, we gotta keep'em grindin' etc. / easy mode)
---
- AA games(Games from big to medium range companies that only have a purchase price and maybe expansions, a profitable project yet one that would never make shareholders of big publishers happy / normal mode)
---
- indie games(Games from a very very small team or just 1 person, a true passion project, a real gamble for the dev / hard mode)
---
In this context a AAA game is a game from a huge publisher with lots of marketing behind it. Also please note that there are as always outliers and also good/bad examples of all categories(like a greedy indie dev).
---
For example, Anthem is a pure greed project. Everybody who played it agrees that it's boring, lacks passion and it's like having fun is just an afterthought.
---
I might be wrong of course. This is just my personal opinion on a complicated subject.
---
Since you have an extra week to prepare now, [metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/WvW#meta) is the defacto place to look up WvW builds and guides. Really useful for beginners.
---
So... how's that about the Game not being compromised because of this layoffs? 
---
Aney have close their offices for two days to deal with the restructure and redundancies. The patch will almost certainly be pushed back a week. 
---
Sorry you feel that way, but I work hard for my money and ncsofts history is against them.  It's up to them to change my mind, as a consumer it's not my job to give them money to keep them around, it's their job to give me a reason to hand them money.  Just ask all the people that bought the original nest-like devices that we're just switched off when the company went out.  
---
Companies can't lay people off?  I mean, every company has to eventually restructure.  It's often times how young people get their jobs.
---
I estimate odds are low, but I could see NCSoft pushing for it one day, and the outcome would depend who is still at ANet management. 
---
If any of the OG’s are still there who understand this would really be the death of the game, they’ll resist it. Then it would come down to who has more leverage, NCSoft or ANet.
---
But if they’re all gone and new people are in their place who may not share the OG’s ethos on this, then who knows. All bets are off.
---
I did one yesterday with portals and swiftness boosts along the way. From my experience, it's true norm. 
---
Stop feeding the psycho trolls.
---
You're feeding the troll.
---
25% of your company gone in one day. Wow. I'm not sure what NCSoft is thinking but clearly they don't believe in GW2 at all.
---
Sources? 
---
I was thinking about private servers for GW2 the other night, and how fun it would be to run some Ironman servers for the game. No trading post, no waypoints, possible permadeath if no one res' you? 
---
Imagine how gut wrenching and sweat inducing running a dungeon would be. If the whole squad wipes, that's a wrap. Time to reroll. Put the gem store items in game too, if that were mutable. As in, make them in game rewards. Dude, I'd straight up pay $15 a month to a private server just to have that experience. 
---
"it is business" is why companies get away with shit like this over and over. Because they know a lot of people literally sdont give a shit about how they treat their workers because theyre too busy stewing in their own ennui or worship if capitalism.
---
Was shocked to find out it takes 400 people to shit out garbage content on a monthly bases. 
---
An interview with anet in 2013. Go google.
---
However many devs have been moved off gw over the past few years and onto the side projects. Apparently this includes some prominent names.
---
Gem shop still running fine, see, they were not lying.
---
Sure but the guys at ANet literally only found out about the layoffs a few days ago. It was a huge unexpected unpleasant surprise. They were working on other projects anyway.
---
That said, wouldn't it be dark is that's how the game ends?
---
Appreciate that response, about what I suspected really. 
---
Didn't/couldn't do much for the game as 99% of its players experience it, communicated enough that reddit decides he was truly trying to tho, reddit mourns when he leaves.
---
I agree, it's honestly pretty hard to hit enrage time with all your players still alive and doing all mechanics correctly. Raid squads should not be rewarded just because a portion of the squad can survive and carry the rest of encounter after the chafe has been defeated. 
---
And dps rotation is probably the easiest thing to practice, to the point where it's rare to see pugs who can do every mechanic while still having dogshit dps. It's almost always the other way around. 
---
after 9 years in development hopefully it will have been worth the wait
---
When it ruins the livelihoods of people who have been working for them for a decade and a half? People that have poured their heart and soul into the game and its community, so that we have grown to love them?
---
Sure. Sure they can fucking do that.
---
See if I'll give them money after it though.
---
Hahahaaaaa
---
It is only partly a joke, at a plysical keyboard I can never seem to type the correctly on the first try, it always comes out as teh. 
---
I played WoW for 14+ years and been subbed to FFXIV for 5+ and nothing currently in WoW comes close to my monk, samurai, or dragoon in FFXIV. I actually wish they'd condense more abilities like they do in PVP because my hands cramp up in 5+ minute fights.
---
WotLK/Cata/MoP/WoD enhance shaman is what I played the most and that shit got pretty silly along with sub rogue, feral druid, and arms/fury warrior (sometimes).
---
I do enjoy how my current survival hunter, monk, DH (flows way better than in Legion), and ret paladin plays though. Not sure if I'll resub to WoW again or not because the next FF expansion looks fantastic and I have enough PC/Switch games to play. They should have stuck with the superior weapon system over the stupid necklace.
---
Unfortunately you need to grow every year in our economy which is plagued by governments taking on debt and central banks printing a ridiculous amount of money.
---
Because even if you go by the official inflation rate of about 3% you need to grow (make 103% of previous years revenue) to just stay at the same level. If you make less than that you actually shrink.
---
And those 3% are heavily doctored so the government (whichever party is in power doesn't matter) doesn't look bad. If you compare net wages and purchasing power and add indirect taxation onto that your real inflation rate is at 10% already.
---
So businesses need to "grow" just to stay in place.
---
Yet it takes 1 person to shit out garbage comment in moment like this...
---
&gt;  It became hour or two long streams of watching devs play PvE content we already had access to. Where is the fun in that? Yeah, I'd like to play with the developers and don't mind the stream but the point is that it could be used for so much more. Do it a week earlier and show parts of the new map or maybe the new legendary weapon. 
---
With the content lasting for only 1-2 hours, if they did a 1-2 hour stream then that would be showing all of it.
---
I'm talking cumulatively. The money to effort ratio is far skewed.
---
And fanboys to ignore the state of the game. 
---
GW2 confirmed dead.
---
Press F to pay respects.
---
Because $15 a month is a lot of money. I always hate it when people whine about that aspect of MMOs. Its a much higher quality MMO than GW2 is and gets more updates. You don;t get that shit for free ya know...
---
I completed the achievement but didn't knew about the orchid nodes. How do I get them?
---
Not all of those 400 people actually worked on gw2 if you cared to do any sort of actual reading and comprehension 
---
Yes, all those small business owners. Delusional capitalist pigs. /s 
---
I havnt really tested it i was trusting the other thief of my raidgroup on this since he has raided a lot more and die test this afik. Anyway eben without testing ist better on quadim easily since you dont fight the adds when they are under 80%. On trio it schould ne better aswell since the bomb is pulling all The adds into the boss and the fight is really schort. On samarog it needs testing but i take it anyway as aditional cc. I can imagine that it can ne theoretically beneficial for w6b1 because you have burst phases on this one (you steal it from the shield).
---
should be changed to "2814 laid off today"
---
I think the layoffs is the best thing that could happen to gw2. NCsoft is not at fault for arenaneta failures. They fund them not command them and anet has confirmed this in the past that they have a lot of free will. Anet fucked itself and nobody execpt anet itself is at fault for the layoffs. Maybe not they can actually focus on the money maker. Though I suspect aneta thought process is like this: "oh shit we need to make money! Quick halfass the episodes and focus on the gemstore!" 
---
Im glad I quit the game so long ago.
---
I had the same opinion than you. But when you see who was laid off, many people that actively worked on GW2 content ... it doesn't look good to me.
---
GW2 is not going anywhere any time soon. It is unfortunate that ANet lost a lot of good talent, but that does not mean they are done for. (In fact, this was an apparent attempt on NCSoft's part to benefit GW2 at the cost of other, failed projects.)  
---
Then again, you might be right. If you and others overreact and cut off their main sources of revenue, then that may acerbate the issue. That said, I think ANet believes that the majority of the community understands that just because there is bad news that does not mean certain doom. 
---
So first of all I have to point out that I am all about power to the people, and people react differently to different things. However I do not understand why y'all have to go fucking ultracringe over this whole situation. YOU never did anything to facilitate the game or drive the story forwards, you are nothing but audience in the TV Series that is GW2 living story. 
---
This post is dumb but all the posts on the frontpage atm are dumb. This is capitalism deal with it. 
---
The first project was supposed to be a companion app for GW2.  There were talks about this being worked on since release, but there aren't any confirmations of team sizes.  Safe to say this app idea was scrapped.
---
Anet has also been hiring mobile game devs for the past couple years.  This sub's community to regularly post and comment on things like this when it would show on Anet's official website job opportunities.  Most recently this was brought up by posters last year when we were talking about Anet Marketing positions openings during the Friend/Ship controversy. 
---
Not really. If anet isn't interested but people still want it then what else would you do except go over their head to put pressure on them and basically force them to do it.
---
Classic servers just released I believe
---
To be fair, I would not mind Outfits and Chairs AS WELL AS armor sets and bug patches, but...that may just be me : P
---
Oh I’m aware not all 400 of their employees was on GW2. Executives choose to move and hire people for other projects into of maintaining heir flagship. How many times does an op date need 3-4 additional updates because it breaks stuff?  How often does oversight due to devs result in nerfs to classes (necro AG for example)
---
The executives are fully responsible for the state of the game and choosing to release these garbage stories and untested skill balance/rune updates is on them.  
---
I honestly thought GW2 had a staff on 200-250 with the quality of work they have put out since before HoT. And with PoF designed from the ground up to force mounts then market the skins at crazy prices. Some skins are equal value as the expansion?  How does that even make sense?  Moving forward from the constant barrage of mount skins, it was clear gw2 stopped caring about quality story driven content that’s fun and rewarding to play. Time Gating everything in PoF for leg making? And don’t even get me started with how bad the story is. 
---
I’ll stop there. 
---
I do feel bad for the employees but maybe this will kick Anet back into gear to what it used to do and be, making a quality game that’s fun to play instead of forcing you to play. 
---
Executives fucked up and papa NCSoft wants to make money. Unfortunately it’s the lowly employees that have to pay that price while the executives get to keep their cushy jobs. 
---
I disagree that one's dps ability is over- emphasized, especially for end game PvE content like raids or fractals. They are meant to be challenging, and if everyone could do raids without outputting decent dps then it would not be challenging.   
---
Dps rotation isn't mandatory nor enforced. All the raid/fractal encounter cares about is your squad being able to kill the boss before it kills you. It's just like Jumping Puzzles that are timed. You need to be able to make a certain progress before the fail conditions trigger, that's part of the challenge. The longer the encounter drags on, the more likely a member of your squad fails mechanics and kills him/herself or the entire squad. It's simply part of the difficulty.   
---
Raids can be doable with low dps by having everyone in the squad never failing a single mechanic, e.g. see various top raiding guilds showcasing pulls with less than 10 players. But this obviously is much harder than having people with decent dps.   
---
Therefore dps rotation arises as the OPTIMAL method of delivering the most damage over time, and reducing the amount of mechanics your squad is exposed to. It's basically the game asking you whether you understand your class well enough: which skill does the most damage, how to take advantage of trait lines that offer you dps boosts.   
---
If you can't follow an elementalist dps rotation consistently then perhaps choose a dps build with a much easier rotation like dagger/dagger Deadeye or consider playing a role that has no rotation, like support Druid.   
---
It's unfortunate that your disabilities prevent you from having full enjoyment of the game, but you can't blame the game for having dps checks, in a game about running around killing stuff. 
---
All my love to the outgoing employees. Thank you so much for everything you've put into this game and this community. I wish you all the best and hope you all land on your feet and find new and exciting adventures &lt;3
---
Skins are probably the easiest thing to produce.
---
**Optimistic viewpoint:**  
---
A restructuring of staff could lead to a positive shift of approach, a renewed focus on GW2, which may lead to improved content production and quality. The game could end up better off than before.  
---
**Pessimistic viewpoint:**  
---
The game was already struggling, the previous expansion and living world model was not working out, and with a significant portion of the company gone including prominent developers, the situation will only worsen.  
---
Raids and fractals updates were already slow and those communities were already leaving the game. If these are further cut will cause even more of those players to abandon the game.  
---
LWS5 will continue, but this isn't reassuring. Players are already dissatisfied with the status quo, and another 1.5 years of this is nothing to be excited about. The game may see a significant decline during this period, or afterwards if nothing substantial like an expansion is planned.    
---
If they wanted to they could wrap up the main storyline in LWS5 or 6, and with this they could end serious development of the game.  
---

Thief, Warrior, and guardian are great classes to play with only core in wvw, Warrior and Thief can be used to roam pretty well, and if you want to zerg your can use Warrior or Guard and get away with it most times with picky commanders, as they're both still pretty good to have even without their elites... if you're confident you can bring ele, but more often than not you'll get destroyed as the elite specs are much more powerful in comparison. Anything else isn't worth your time, and with more hardcore commanders certain classes (ranger and thief) will be kicked outright from the zerg. You can roam with any class though, you'll just get shit on by people with elite specs unless you're playing a class that is strong even without one equipped.
---
They most certainly weren't scrapped because of some expected backlash.
---
Some guy was working on a private server, but I have no idea what happened to him.
---
Here's a video he released: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFzWCpXqOyM
---
Yeah That is an important distinction. Especially since more western games have gone free to play, Korean MMOs have taken a back seat to much of the west. I used to play a lot of those back when I really needed something new to do during the bigger mmo age a decade ago or so.
---
But, many of their games are excessively grindy, very poorly monetized and while NCSoft in particular is usually pretty fine, most of them have half assed localizations as well. Western players have different expectations in our games than people in other parts of the world, and because of that a Western made MMO is more likely to appeal to a Western audience as the developers know who they're developing for better.
---
Even taking myself into consideration, I've played a lot of Korean mmos to kill time in the past, but I never have stuck to one for very long like I do the western ones and I've been glued to at least one MMO at a time ever since Dark Age of Camelot was in it's hayday. I respect Korean gamers and such but their expectations in games are fairly different than the common westerner and the monetization methods especially show in games. Although honestly I dunno why anyone would stick around for the amount of pay to win crap I've seen in a lot of their games but such are things.
---
As far as NC goes, I would really hate to see them get crappier in the west, they also have some of the more decent support people compared to some competitors even, and I dunno if they'd keep doing much of anything in the West if they got rid of GW2 now that Wildstar's gone I think it's their last Western game. All that said I still miss City of Heroes
---
Well it is my guess, it’s not hard fact. 
---
Thanks for your input ^^
---
But what evidence would suggest the game would ever be "shut down"? GW1 is still running. Skeleton crew sure, but its running.
---
I'm just really tired of outfits, i'd be fine with them if we atleast got armor sets or you could unlock all the pieces for it and use them separately with transmutation charges, while keeping the whole outfit thing going on.
---
Might check it out, character creation in that game was hilarious 
---
I think you give people far too much credit. If their roadmap said it was going to take a year from now to get the wvw updates out, people would go fucking bananas.
---
That's the beginning of the end for gw2 unfortunately 
---
GW2 is ageing. Unless they are working on projects for the future then there will be more layoffs in the future and the company will be in decline.
---
This sub? This site. You'd really think people here never worked or had social experiences. Not even joking.
---
If you like PvP, do PvP. You get endless amounts of exotics and playing through a Season long enough will give you enough ascended shards of glory to drown yourself in. You really have to enjoy it though, as it is by far the worst method to grind half-assedly.
---
I was literally set to buy this game tonight after trying the FTP for a few days and loving it- seems a bad move now.
---
Awful news for those losing their jobs....i cant help thinking the golden age of MMO is well and truly over.
---
I think NC is dropping the ball on this big time too. MMOs are not the fad they used to be, and sadly I don't want to see this genre go. I especially don't want it replaced with a bunch of shitty "live service" games that'll be 1 year run fly by night crap either.
---
The thing is, there's really not all that many serious, good, especially high budget, MMOs running in the west anymore. Dropping the ball on this game is a bad idea if they want to keep any foothold in the west at all, especially in the big leagues. I know they run English copies of some of their Korean games but there's no way in hell in total the numbers of all those add up to more than the active GW2 player base in the west. The thing is, GW2 has a committed player base, and a committed lore base going back to the first game as well which is great.
---
These days it's just in general really hard to start, and keep players in an mmo, and I don't want to see one of the better high budget ones we have left falter. It's a disappointing state of MMOs in general lately, I used to keep up on so many in my game news anymore and now I can't even name any upcoming MMOs that have half a chance to succeed at anything, which is a damn shame. 
---
This is like saying "Lets cut off the leg" when someone has an ingrown toenail.
---
As someone who highly disagrees with the way anet treated gw2 for the past few years, it easily might be the opposite.
---
I'm still spending mine because I am still having fun in the game. It's my hobby, which is why I'm funding it, and for me it's definitely not a long-term investment. 
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
I might stick with Guardian for the moment then, I'm almost at level 80. Should I go towards a tank/healing build or damage? I'm more interested in large scale fights at the moment, maybe a bit of roaming when I get good at the game.
---
ITT: Angry, misguided people who don't understand that gaming companies are businesses, just like every other company.
---
They could simply disable mounts just like they do during jumping puzzles. 
---
Yep I've heard that too. I actually wanted to go into game dev for the longest time, I'll never get to really pursue that passion. I hate how disgusting business is anymore. But yeah it seems most general IT staff make more money and have less stress in their positions than game devs. 
---
Core engi with conditions or hybrid works surprisingly good too. Holo does a shitton more damage ofc but for roaming it's really fine. It's not easy to play though, for starting WvW zerg a core guardian is maybe the most useful and easiest to learn. It's also cheap to eqip so you might start there to learn about WvW and maps.
---
Honestly, nowadays pretty much all the younger gamers are gaming on mobile devices. Mobile Legends, and other MOBAs or BRs on mobile devices are pretty much in the same place right now as MMOs were in the 2000s. Hell, a whole pile of classic MMOs got rereleases as mobile MMOs (Lineage, Mu, Maplestory, Ragnarok, etc)
---
I cant see the reason yet but I think I was suspended for saying that its interesting in this day and age with all AAA devs being greedy as all heck with microtransactions, GW2 fans dont think Anet is greedy enough, in response to a thread on how to monetize GW2 further with subscriptions and the like. Suppose it was viewed as a dreadfull attack on forum users. I've been infracted before for using the word "you" in general terms as well.
---
So I signed up to Reddit yesterday lol (yeah I'm slow).
---
"Fear not this night. You will not go astray.   
---
Though shadows fall still the stars..find their way."
---
Actually, their linkedin page shows 399 employees. That's probably the best estimate we can get.
---
I'm fine with a minstrel mes sure, not so sure about the knights thief though...
---
I don't know their thought processes, and don't presume to know. I'd rather err on the side of compassion, especially since information has been pretty scarce. 
---
I'm frustrated by the situation too, and have had my criticisms of the company in the past, but I want the best for everyone involved, staying and leaving, and right now your post kinda feels like dogpiling on someone who's already down.
---
This kind of reminds me of that scene in Harry Potter where Ron is listening to the radio as they announce the dead or missing people
---
Yep, they still have 300 people which should be way more than enough to put out that 3 hours of content once every blue moon. I know that's hard words and people may dislike my comment, but for the amount of people available, the speed at which updates are delivered is just way to low
---
If you’re afraid of the game losing updates, then just hold off spending any $ on it. But I have hope they won’t shut down a top 3 mmo!
---
Mounts and gliders are entirely different proportions. Try the reverse: Take your mounts and go to HoT zones. The experience is entirely different than when HoT was released. It's less dangerous, mounts allow you to just skip most challenges. The raptor can jump across chasms or over enemies, the springer allows you to jump up to places that 3 years ago would have required a significant detour, and the gryphon allows you to just skip the entire map. This same thing would happen with any new maps that aren't made with mounts in mind.
---
Thanks for the tips! What gear stat are you using? should I go condi or direct damage?
---
Yeah my company was boasting about growth and profits and "we are doing fine". Even had a big boss single me out two months ago in a meeting and say to me we were doing fine and nothing to worry about. Two weeks ago they announced 1700 people are getting laid off.
---
moBiLE g3Ms MuST bE wHy...   Fucking dumbass dude. 
---
and a huge pay out
---
This is big. That becomes evidently clear the way Maclaine writes about Drew. Drew is the mastermind behind a lot of the sound effects. From the videos I've seen of him he looks like an amazing person. Big loss for Anet
---
Let's be real here, as long as it's not soldier gear the person is probably not the worst player (probably being the key word)
---
Thanks for the advice! Engi looks fun, I haven't played it yet though. Is it a good choice for large scale fights?
---
calm down and don't get swept up in the hysteria.
---
What you say is right, and in current state im really broken on two sides, on one i know there are many more ppl who worked on this game and i wish to support them for making this masterpiece. On other side, i really have "history" of true hate toward ncsoft. 
---
Lastly i am thinking how to support game and not support ncsoft, and it feels impossible :/.
---
"Wait and See" is the best course of action for now. The layoffs just happened, nobody knows what's going on now, especially us.
---
He already has successful side projects and an established patreon and long arts stream. They’re pretty damn good as well. 
---
This is what the subreddit needs right now. Nice.
---
They have 300 devs left, that's not a sign of a dead game, and that's actually more than many MMOs have. 
---
... but I am victim of mass hysteria, and actively realizing a self-fulfilling prophecy.
---
Okay well that’s really say for the 12 of you; but now the rest of us are being affected. PANIC!!!!
---
We might not even have a raid team anymore as far as I can tell... what a shitshow.
---
&gt; Why are people not okay with some staff guardian in fullsoldier?
---
Mostly because raid bosses have timers, and the staff full soldier guardian will make it through in a non timed dungeon, but it won't be as useful as another healer, tank or DPS for a timed raid boss.
---
You are fucking stupid. You don't play a game for rewards, you play to have fun. Saying you don't like something even if you never tried is the mentality of a 4 year old.
---
After the dust settles they'll be left with an amount of devs that is more in line with what other MMOs maintain for their games. 
---
Linkedin is as official and as updated source as we can get.
---
Gw2 is already on a downfall, the company doesn't realize that they've made the best combat system in the industry and refuses to make more raid and fractal content as they should do, instead make massive maps for releases that have no purpose, basically wasting time every release instead of adding some real content, even the story comes at least 3 months from the last one
---
I know, I am looking forward to the future
---
When fighting another competent group, not really
---
Read Why Leaders Eat Last, by Simon Sinek. Or cheap and watch the related TED Talk. Large layoffs are lazy management. (Oh, accidental alliteration.)

15679 overall.
---
Thank you all of you who worked on this game.
---
Have you looked into sales for the expansions? [DLGamer is 38% off the pack](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911) ($36.99) [Nuuvem also has a bundle \(that is region locked\)](https://www.nuuvem.com/bundle/guild-wars-bundle) but the games themselves are still on sale ($13.49 + $14.99).
---
God damn it I just started getting back into the game.
---
She clearly didn’t leave. It sounds like she was let go. To be honest Gaile hasn’t really been massively relevant since she quit being the community rep.
---
More like getting a nice severance package and leaving before ncsoft shuts it down.
---
Direct damage is the safest bet, since burn guard is a much better single target damage dealer if i remember correctly when it comes to core, but what you really want to do is just tag many people as possible to get the most shit, and check loot all in options so when you hit the key to loot it loots all bags nearby you automatically. 
---
This is probably all just a huge PR stunt to get us all as depressed as possible, so we can get be even more affected by whatever comes in Episode 6. None of this is real right? RIGHT?
---
Don't worry its a bot downvoting you, it happens to every thread on this sub.

Carrion necro fistbump

How unfortunate it would be to have your brain.  
---
Lots that aren't registered for LinkedIn at all or will take time to update it!
---
Whats the right reasons to log in? Wood farming? Dailies?
---
Relatively this is much worse, 25% vs 8%.
---
I've also been thinking about that, and even if we could build a working server and client (possible, IMO) the art assets still all belong to ANet, which could be problematic :S
---
They will be getting the biggest pay outs that's why. If it's anything like my country.
---
12, that's funny.
---
Ensure that people get appropriate notice periods and redundancy pay. 
---
Rather than some of the "Yeah we're gonna have to let a bunch of people go, you you you and you clear out your desks by lunchtime, oh yeah and we aren't going to pay you any redundancy because we don't have to so sucks to be you".
---
To have fun.
---
Indeed - at a previous job someone I worked with took voluntary redundancy and got something like two years pay to go. 
---
Well of course, i can only pull this shit off because i had to move from Vabbi over to Dragonbrand due to really bad server lag, i completely understand commanders kicking anyone who isn't running a useful build and class, but when you're on such a low tier everyone is so shit that you could be using the worst build ever and still wipe everyone else. Man I miss Vabbi, the 2k lag spikes just made it unbearable for me.
---
They may not need NCSoft now, but they did way back when they started as a company. So NCSoft gave ArenaNet funding to make Guild Wars in exchange for ownership of the company and its IP. The only way ArenaNet gets out of this deal is if they buy themselves out, which would probably cost a shitton more money than they actually make, because NCSoft isn't going to easily give up this kind of cash cow.

---
What do you mean by CM. Did this guy invent the idea of fractals?
---
I believe that most of the technical and/or creative people are registered here. And since those laid off are probably looking for new jobs, well... it shouldn't take them a long time to update their profiles.

I just saw her again recently at the Chinese New Year festival.....:/

Top 3 MMOs? ESO has around 3 Mio. Subs... thats way more than GW2 has. It Top 4...

Not really since core engi lacks in cleave, but roaming, condi engi is really busted last time i checked. You can reach 24k burning damage with one button, it'll kill most people if they don't know how to condi cleanse
---
Conspiracy theory:
---
Aion Legions flopped hard. I mean it kinda failed, that's why NcSoft stopped ArenaNet project(s)
---
Oh ok, didn't know that. Thank you.
---
Don't forget Smite!
---
Thank you for all this year's and the story behind this game ! 
---
This! Wish I could upvote it more. 
---
Honestly the rewards are perfectly adequate for how quick full clears are with a competent group. Lack of new raids killed the raid scene, not lack of rewards.
---
All that is present in the maps, dungeons low man, fractals, WvW, PvP, Meta, cohordinate a group of players, be it a guild or a squad, achievement hunting and I'm sure forgotting something. Can't you see those? If if is not of your taste, change game and goodbye :)
---
Thank you for sharing your skills (and your potato PC) and for your constant willingness to help us all :)
---
Or they just make it like they promised before launching the first expansion and make all previous expansions part of the base game whenever the last one launches (like WoW).
---
To all of the hard working talented developers (game, story, art, audio) at anet (current and past) thank you! To all of the management at anet (current and past) fuck you!
---
Haven’t touched guild wars for about 3 months. Any context what it’s about?
---
Would be amazing to see how many people block based on statements you might make in map chat. You won't know unless they say atm.
---
Doesn't change the fact that a lot of people who defined what GW2 is today are gone now. If the quality of patches was already going down I can only imagine what will happen now.
---
You shouldn't. At least not until you get some information about the game's future.
---
I disagree with you. Even if their intent is to still make money out of it, very important devs have left the company so the quality of future patches will probably go down. Quality goes down, more players leave and you know the rest.
---
You can be absolutely certain it's nothing like this.
---
ArenaNet *need* to have at least one other project in development. GW2 is an old game, and even if it is a successful one, it can't last forever. They need to think about the time it won't be around to feed them and they have to prepare for this in advance, as game development is a long process. It takes literal years. Years during which you still need to pay all your expenses. Like office rent and salaries. Try to think about how much this costs, for a studio of this size.
---
Having projects cancelled is very bad news, because it means a lot of wasted resources. That being said, it is still preferable to pouring more resources into a project that won't pay for itself in the end.
---
I would also like to point out 400 people was probably too many for their own good. Successful studios have a tendency to bloat and lose efficiency. Come to think of it, it's only natural - a population will grow when there is an abundance of food in its ecosystem, often to the point of exhausting it and shrinking back. You would think we should be able to foresee this, but success is an addictive thing that makes you happy and not care much about the future.

Chelsea Mills (environment artist) just tweeted that she is staying at Anet:

---
I thought it would have been extremely important to make big update hit us right on time to show off players that the game is not dying and to invite us back to play but I guess I was wrong. 
---
No, this gotta be a troll. I refuse to believe the existence of someone THAT socially inept.
---
and then there's this asshole
---
Are you thinking that buying gem is somehow similar with buying real estates?
---
Buying games or spending money on games are like buying movie tickets.
---
Jesus.
---
I do everything that is the best content. 
---
Playing once per week and staying on reddit thumbing down others trolling and being a pleb is not for me.
---
Yes but some kind of compensation would make us feel happier
---
are you going for the most downvoted post in subreddit history?
---
how dare you, what did that poor pepe ever do to you
---
same opinion. ncsoft is %100 right to take action. anet must focus on gw2 which is one of the most popular mmorpg around. 
---
Simply put, just get the trinkets and weapons and dont worry about the armor. You'll get the mats for it eventually, depending on what you like to play.
---
Seasonal skins that can be bought for heroes... 
---
Lord faren in a santa hat and boxers... There is a huge market for that crap.
---
Would have opened up actual value to the finisher market too (I wouldn't have downed state in it, but I would have included auto finishers for whomever landed the killing blow) 
---
you are saying ''us'' but you actually mean ''me''.
---
Aren't we done with this person? idk why in a moment like this bring this old stuff back in, what occur to her has nothing to do with the layoffs that we are having right now, i literally dont think that she should be brought here in this subreddit anymore.
---
Just ignore people talking rubbish about the game dying.
---
It's sort of encouraged by the recent events, but I've been uncomfortable with the fact that there aren't any solid projects out there. I'd start one myself if I could get past writing a Zork clone in terminal and some janky GUI stuff.
---
Investing money in a company with no certain future is stupid from my point of view. If anet want's money, they should release content. An expansion for example.
---
&gt; just try to be positive and support the game at any cost
---
Why? It's their job to keep business floating.
---
Have they actually ever stated that for GW2? I know its true for GW1 but that game runs instances for small groups which I imagine lowers the amount of data that has to be spread around to players while GW2 has much larger player counts on maps with serverside dynamic events and such...
---
&gt;Guild Wars 2 at the moment is among the top 3 MMORPG games out there. NCSoft are no stupid people, they know this and won't dare to close a game like this just because.
---
​
---
Being top 3 in a genre that's not that profitable doesn't really mean much. Further, it's even debatable if GW2 is actually sitting at #3 spot.
---
If ArenaNet stops being a thing (possible, see: City of Heroes/Villains), that won't matter. And WoW server softwares haven't had too much of an issue with that so far.
---
This is the third time I've seen you post about private servers.
---
Well, technically GW2 is still there, you can always login and play, hence why it is not affected, truly. They didn't say "GW2 development won't be affected" because that clearly wouldn't be the case, apparently. Same reasoning when GW2 got released even GW1 was not affected because is still there. If you keep the access to a service there is enough for the company to get away with some smart wording..
---
She looks like she is using the swords to prop her self up, which uses energy. If she was tired, the swords would be dragging behind her, I gather this is then an depth/perspective issue... If so, art work-wise everything is well done.
---
With 1 LWS map every 4-5 months is was painstakingly obvious but to much benefit of doubt was afforded to anets management team.
---
yes, me as a player who is Witewawwy Not Effect By the Layoffs at all ***DEMANDS*** compensation because REAL PEOPLE losing JOBS THAT MAKE THEM MONEY makes me Vewy Upsetti Spaghetti and Please Give Me Both expansions and 1200 gems for free because I"m Vewy Depwessed about the wayoffs!!!!!!!! UmU

/s
---
they confirmed season 5, which means at least 2 years considering how delayed they were with episodes in season 4
---
2nd time, one as a main post, and one here.
---
I hope so. Game has had a good run tho
---
Does it even matter anymore at this point?
---
your anti-hysteria campaign sounds hysterical to me
---
ye i also hope gw2 as game will benefit from this. it was on maintenance mode for some time, just ppl didnt want to believe it. 
---
[oh](https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/auw0a7/200k_subs_3/) [really?](https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/auxd6t/200k_subs/)
---
whole guild wars franchise is funded by similar "scam" as you call it, city of heroes funded you game so acting like you do is pretty hypocritical :)
---
Wtf is this logic. We are costumers not philanthropists. You pay for the product, not for the employees. 
---
i'm more annoyed actually
---
gw2 was never a problem for ncsoft, anet is a problem
---
Wtf in what kind of world are you living?
---
A proper GW3 on an engine which actually knows what a graphics card is would be awesome.
---
More so if the focus is on large-scape PvP, DAoC-style. Instead of the PvE. Just use WvW as the definitive endgame including best PvE farming areas being in dangerous spots and a Darkness Falls to fight over. That's what made DAoC so awesome to begin with.
---
Im on same boat as you, but i believe we should, not sick amounts but we should. There are still ppl working on this game and who need our support. 
---
There's also the point that really old online games with tiny active playerbases are utterly trivial to run these days
---
&gt;redditor for 8 days
---
It's yet another Mike alt. Downvote and move on.
---
If you say so.
---
i remember time where ncsoft was publishing gw franchise (gw1 and gw2) and i remember very well those were better times (for game).
---
&gt; We are talking about a game that has earned over 80 billion in 2018: 3 billion less than in 2017 but 3 billion more than in 2016
---
80 Billion KRW (Korean won) which means it is ~$71 **million**. Still a hefty sum.
---
Saying that the game is dying is fearmongering right now. What is coming out of this situation has to be seen and only something we can hear from an official source. 
---
City of Heroes/Villains would like to reach a skeletal hand up from the grave.
---
Hey hey easy there, I died so many times in cm story from the robot in the beginning long ago
---
hope we get a freebie
---
Hey all
---
I literally downloaded the game a few days ago, ive played POE, WOW etc before and loved it - the live events, personal story etc.
---
I was planning to purchase the expansions after work, THEN i see half the staff have been fired??. It is awful for the people losing their jobs, i know how much this would be a huge problem for me.
---
Does anyone know if this is GW2 staff leaving or staff from other projects?
---
I was all set to make this my mmo home, but cant help wondering if the lifespan of GW2 is suddenly looking shorter?
---
Thanks.
---
Please ignore these comments because you'll not get into any group with such builds. It's builds thay work in 1% of the cases or that don't work at all but the ones who play them cant see that because they are too stubborn to realize it.
---
For roaming: warrior, thief or guardian, in that order. Power mesmer can also be strong.
---
For zergs you have dps backline ele, support guard and heal engi.
---
Check metabattle, it usually has f2p builds for all game modes.
---
You make the very large assumption that some of these people didn't want to be laid off or start a new job. You also make a very large assumption that it will be bad for them. I bet if you asked many (all) of them in private they would say keep playing the game, not just for the sake of their colleagues but for their own sake. Getting laid off can be very advantageous if you are mobile. New company fresh skills fresh environment big payout time off and so on.
---
In a "fair" world people who made something great could coast to retirement or stay on forever but it's all about what you offer right now not what you did before. Unfortunate reality of business is it's point in time and not about what happened before (and cannot be). Consider that the current situation no new game released for years was caused in part by inertia and a sense of complacency that had to be broken. We don't know what went on inside -- the mobile crap and B-projects could have been spearheaded by some of these people. Finally consider what is best for the future isn't necessarily holding onto the past.
---
If you want alternative company structures where there's no "corporate shitheads" well we could talk about alternative company structures like cooperatives but consider that the high salaries and years of this game wouldn't be possible without investment from said fat cats. It is all about numbers they want a certain rate of return just breaking even isn't enough to makeup what they put in and they have a right to ask that. If you want a cooperative let's go I will work for zero will you? It isn't unionized work. These people knew what they signed up for.
---
Anyway sad day for everyone but not necessarily as sad as let's boycott my favourite game.
---
We don't know what Mike or ncsoft planning yet,  gw 2 is one of their most successful games,  and they said gw 2 is not gonna affected from these events.  From my point of view,  Mike is a very successful manager,  and NCSOFT is the best company I know about mmo business. After pof,  gw 2 lost its hype too soon,  cuz of traditional mechanics of the serie,  sure they were very good,  but a change was needed to continue in 2019.  I always think of gw 2 as 1 of the most underrated games,  they made great content but how much they get appreciation for them?  To be called in top 5 mmo even  non of others worth their rank for many reasons. Old employees,  they were great.  But like in human life,  change is always needed to survive
---
Currently at \[&amp;BKgCAAA=\]. Also, thank you :D
---
dont care if they dislike or not. u r %100 correct.
---
Erm didnt we hit this number a while back? The more significant number is how many people online
---
At this point I could argue that I'm not a f2p player at all, play GW2 since beta and still play GW1, but well... 
---
All the downvotes in *all* your comments speak for themself.
---
So, nothing more to say. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Thank you NCSoft. You just took away any motivation to spend any further € on your games. You killed Wildstar in the last year, and now you lay off the best and oldest employees at ArenaNet. Seeing Josh Foreman, Gaile Gray (it was already bad when she left the GW1 team) and other beloved developers/Community Managers/etc leaving breaks my heart. And I know you will hurt us even more, so it's best to keep a huge distance to any games you will ever publish. 
---
yes :(
---
so.....it will be last EP LS and expansion that we will see ?  fired key employees.....
---
 fired a wonderful composer  [Lena Chappelle](https://twitter.com/kuraine/status/1100142594653188096).  Hate NCsoft :(
---
Lineage and MU mobile are super generic. I would love to have the original MU ported like RuneScape.
---
Business standpoint, this is accurate.
---
Also a fact that Anet didn't cushion their PR to alleviate the emotional peeps of the community.
---
If anything, I'm done with the "feel good" tactic and wish washy passion dressed in pink and hippies.
---
My best wishes for more true blockbuster series and better management systems. Yes hard whopping training needed to make up for the 100 that left - indubitably, those that left we're highly skilled.
---
Shambles?
---
You call an 18% jump in earnings from 2017 a shambling industry? An industry that earned over $43 billion in revenue for 2018 alone? Some studios are having it rough here and there, but hell. Gaming in general has only gone up and up. There's been layoffs and re-structuring, but that's just corporations trimming away and hacking for more and more profit until they die and the next meteoric rise smashes into the scene.
---
Companies will eventually fail or change, but gaming as an industry is doing phenomenally. Almost exactly the same revenue the entire film industry pulled in 2018.... But the movies only rose by 2.2%. They're not going up. Gaming's still expanding.
---
Some good news at last.
---
It is a very good game just stay away from that sandy casino
---
In the last two minutes he is talking about doing w6 tomorrow. I'm not convinced that he quit
---
I watched that stream yesterday and I'm positive he didn't say that.
---
&gt; that's their decision to make, as it's their game
---
I believe you are confusing having the right to do it with it being a good decision. Of course they have every right to fuck up their game, but it would be a terrible decision.
---
&gt; they will choose what is financially best for them
---
Apparently not, as they just had to fire 1/4 of their work force. Also, I think they should be making the game fun first, and then make sure that it is sustainable, but that might only work if they don't have investors in their backs demanding a  high ROI (like Star Citizen, I hope that works out!).
---
&gt; GW2 has never been the game you're asking for
---
Yea that part is more about MMOs in general (e.g. WoW). GW2 was designed that way from the start, although it was obviously advertised very differently and they doubled down on the gem store pretty hard lately. GW1 was also very different as far as I remember.
---
&gt; there are plenty of MMOs - ESO, WoW, FF
---
Have tried them, WoW is being turned into a slot machine, ESOs combat is pretty boring to me and I don't like the style of FF. As I said, I have searched and tried out quite a few games, but they are either turned into cash grabs, or they are off-putting to me in some other way (which is fair, different people like different things).
---
I'm guessing the cancer discord? , just a guess since I dont go there since its cancer
---
But I’m an Ironman btw.
---
I can't say I blame him. The dude makes a living on twitch and his time might be better spent playing games with more viewership than gw2
---
LW won't be ending with this. Quality may drop, but we won't cease to get content just from this.
---
I mean with that attitude I doubt you'll be welcome anywhere... But if you ever feel like trying you can shoot me a DM
---
I mean we should be on pace for another expansion this year right? PoF will be 2 years old this fall which is basically the same age HoT was
---
Nearly everyone on the list has commented on public social media that they've stayed / left. So not really.
---
Damn. Josh Foreman was my hero of this company. I always thought about him and Colin Johanson when I thought about this game.
---
Josh always stood out with his work, and it is also what makes him so memorable.
---
Why do people like you exists...
---
why do you think this is funny?
---
No. They have posted on public twitter accounts?
---
Thats sad he s cute
---
The last of the good anet employees are gone now , yet barecuck matthew, lindsey and ~~rb2÷×~~~ stay.....BIG YIKES
---
classic gw2 story was decent in the beginning. was super cool that every race had multiple different stories... as soon as you joined one of the 3 orders it became... meh and after that it was bad... especially the whole fight vs zhaitan lol.
---
It's Bubbles ;D
---
Good riddance he only was negative to GW2 and now that GW2 would need him the most he leaves.
---
"ANet stated GW2 would not be affected."
---
Delays balance patch again.
---
IKR! i just did it last week due i created a new character and this is the first image that come to my head lol
---
Hm this is factually false. There is only a rainbow if the sky is not cloudy and the light can pass through the rain. 
---
Thanks a Lot! Best farming guide I saw!
---
if the only thing one can say about someones work is "worked at the core game" of a game that was released 2012 even though we already have 2019.... i'm not sure if its that big of a loss...
---
Okay, but stop using CoH as a comparison. NCSoft shut it down to avoid a lawsuit by Marvel that they thought they couldn’t win. Guild Wars 2 is still their second highest grossing product after Lineage II. It’s not going away.
---
But, seriously, I was there, with Trahearne and Forgal, a fucking Warmaster of the Vigil, and while we all told him "look, the situation is dire", he kept saying "nah, nah, I know better!"  
---
I would have loved to have an option to save Forgal, and let Talon die!
---
Working moral got put to the sword and a chunk of fractal and raid developer got BBQed.
---
Your way of seeing it is like hoping for someone to arive that cuts open the wolf's belly so the bunny can jump out.
---
Of course veterans of this industry leave a place like this. They know that even worse times are comeing down on the employee's in the following months.
---
Of all the bizarre comments you just made, this is perhaps the strangest.
---
You're implying that Anet always does what's best for the company. Have you seen the state of the game? They just fired 100 people, the playerbase is extremely unsatisfied with what's (not) being put out, and their parent company just had to step in and "restructure" them. Does this sound like an infallible company to you? Is this all part of a grand scheme to drum up publicity or something?
---
We both know the answer to that question and it's reflected in the earnings report if you somehow disagree. I'm not trying to shit on the developers here, as most of the blame falls on management, but what they've been doing clearly hasn't been working out so forgive me for not having complete and utter faith in their decisions.
---
Which is a good segue into your next point regarding the casual nature of the game, which is equally nonsensical. Look around. This is where releasing almost no challenging, engaging endgame content got us. Little to no mainstream attention, no twitch presence, poor player retention, all the while hemorrhaging its remaining hardcore/veteran fanbase. Nobody is complaining about being able to buy gold, it's a good system that reduces RMT (and by extension, cuts down on account scamming), provides a way to obtain cash shop currency by playing the game, and allows people like me who mostly WvW and have zero gold income a way to not have to waste my time opening chests in PvE. The complaints are that there's a lack of content and rewards in the game that require anything more than spending money or mere participation. Moreover, there's a lack of challenging content for those rewards to be awarded from due to content being simplified and trivialized to the point of being meaningless.
---
To your last point, again, monetization is not the issue by any means. There are other MMOs but this one, at it's core, is by far the best. All the pieces are there but they refuse to put them together for some reason. And yes, there is a sufficient market for that reward scheme, it's called the gaming industry.
---
I can’t believe how many comments are acting like CoH actually “just” shut down without warning. Marvel was suing NCSoft over it because players were creating characters that looked like Marvel characters, and NCSoft didn’t want to set the precident that might allow corporations to sue over creative freedom of their fans.
---
Guild Wars 2 is one of NCSoft’s biggest money machines after Lineage II. It’s not going away.
---
People need to understand that the lay-offs are only partly responsible for the hysteria. ArenaNet found it really difficult to create a constant, predictable release schedule over the past 6-7 years. Not only did they not follow a pre-set release window, they weren't even sure if they should follow expansion-based cadences or LS-episodes. Add to this fact that they can't even implement the smaller things they promise or they do it with enourmous latency. After PoF I thought we were on the up, they relased LS4 just weeks after PoF, they added a new raid, new fractal, smaller additions in festivals... Life seemed good. But then 2018 came and they again fell apart. Unpredictable shipping dates, highly inconsistent episodes in terms of replayability (Kourna eg) and painfully few Raids and Fractals that would keep the more experienced players going. They decided to cut communcative channels with the audience (okay, maybe due to the press of Ncsoft who knows, doesn't change the result) and they don't want to hear about a road map. Heck, they don't even want to tell us if they plan to release an expansion or anything but LS. Even Assassin's Creed Odyssey has a roadmap which is a shallow RPG... I love Guild Wars as a franchise, I love the devs that put their everything into this project, but I'm sorry, a beautiful but empty and boring map (without incentives to come back) and a predictable story (however lot the story-telling imporved in the past) won't be enough to keep the player base around. 
---
This crisis is just the culimation of the ad hoc and chaotic system that has been going on for some time now. You can argue with my points, maybe you find that the new maps are awesome and the mounts are amazing (I would agree) but the fact that the current state of the game is just not enough, can't be ignored.
---
So I take the bonus WvW exp week is delayed too?
---
Look at guild wars 1.
---
This is not Blizzard.
---
oh no critizsism, how does he dare. everything is fine, nothing to see, move on and buy mount skins.
---
I'm sticking with Guild Wars 2, through good and bad. I have Hope.
---
I think what they said was "GW2 services will not be affected".
---
Some people seem to be interpreting that as meaning GW2 teams won't be affected, whilst to me it seems like a deliberately vague PR comment written in such a way it could simply mean the GW2 servers will continue to run.
---
there is story in raids? im just there for the fun mechanics and gameplay. im willing to fight taimi there as long its fun to do so.
---
easily; you fucking dweeb
---
Thanks, i feel kind of guilty worrying about trivial stuff like this when people lost their jobs!.
---
I really dont want to go back to wow, and i hate mobile games with the constant pop ups urging you to buy gems etc - but mobile games seem to be the growth industry. 
---
I think ill buy POF as thats a small investment and see what happens whilst i work my way casually to 80.
---
Thanks again
---
whispers: some of these "bosses" are actually events.
---
Meanwhile there is still no Qadim guide on yt or heck not even a dhuum guide explaining the fight except that spanish one.
---
For now, let's not be naieve and think there won't be further restructuring from this point once they know what they are going to go for. I wager they will lose another 100 minimum by this time next year.
---
Any piece that cant be hidden, yes. 
---
Not huge money earners though, and I am aware of his endeavours ;) 
---
Most likely "worst case scenario" is GW2 becoming a pay to win game like Aion with a lot more monetization in it. It's not likely to disappear anytime soon, and buying/playing now is more likely to keep it from going that way.
---
NCSoft did claim that these layoffs "won't affect Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 game services", which ultimately means the games will stay up. Whether or not this will remain true is unclear, especially for GW1 servers since they make small profit (despite beyond marginal cost to maintain), but for the time being GW2 will remain. It just may not remain in the same manner going forward (and tbh that scares me more).
---
Just to reiterate. Being naked makes you lose defense stat, which is what toughness also contributes to. 
---
So yes you need all the pieces that cant be hidden. 
---
Also my reaction.
---
Yes, that actually makes sense. :)
---
When I post the same thing I get downvoted to hell.. Weird.
---
Salute to all our beloved Anet  Commanders 
---
THANK YOU FOR LEADING 
---
Currently it’s exotic with 2 ascended pieces, working on a full set though. I agree, the fact you can stat change is great.
---
Really? They have more pressing matters to attend to right now. Like saying goodbye to friends/colleagues etc
---
Yeah I really want to reward track grind out some marauders gear for toons once the WvW bonus comes.
---
had ag for a link once in wvw. had to block him and normally i dont give a damn about chat shitters
---
That is the whole point of company: making money. What that company does is just means of making profit.
---
If you do not do that, you make nonprofit or run charity.
---
Well finally I can be that guy and post this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AxZofbMGpM
---
&gt; It's only shown me that most people are garbage. 
---
most people at the top. sadly they are the investors.
---
thanks for not getting fired :D
---
There's "our product is no longer selling well and we have to downsize" and "this was a really good year but we don't think our CEOs and shareholders are making enough money so we're gutting staffing and those of you lucky enough to keep your jobs now have to do the same work with half the people, GLHF!" Not saying the latter is the exact situation with NCSoft and ANet, more my commentary on the way of the business world in general these days.
---
If you dont like the pre-13 numbered FF games you won't enjoy ff14. 
---
It's every bit as much of a "weeb game" as they are.
---
I guess it is my age - but i hate the move to mobile and p2w games (but presumably it makes a lot of money)
---
A few weeks ago i downloaded one- darkness rises? and sure it is fun and simple initially but there sheer number of pop ups urging you to spend serious money for power ups is astonishing.
---
I dont understand how people feel a sense of achievement when they buy their progress.
---
The massive lay offs was just to make room for him so he can grow the company and hire everyone back after
---
I just came back to GW2 after few years of hiatus and was about to buy both expansions but honestly I am really reconsidering comming back. All that info about the layoffs gives me a hunch this game will be on a life support real soon. Actions speak more than words so head staff's statements that this game will still be alive and kicking in few years aren't reassuring all that much.
---
Read the comment your reply to, before you reply to it :D
---
The 36982h total is nonsense. This number doesn't exist.
---
Which doesnt really shed any light on where the term comes from
---
Farm for ascended jewelry in season 3 maps together with a back pack. Make the extra story after HoT story and get a free ascended weapon in under 1 hour if you use a guide or make one of the ascended collections for the elite spec that have the weapons you need. Infuse rings and back packs https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infused_equipment and you now have enough slots to take you to tier 3. 
---
Meanwhile craft the ascended material that is gated and gather gold in the fractals so you can buy more ascended material, craft the armor either all at once or piece by piece and craft the infusions you gain at each fractal to up it more for you to move up in the tiers.
---
You can do a lot of content alone, even stuff like group dungeons once you get good at the game.
---
That is true, just think this post would be better in a week or something.
---
I would buy that IF the people leaving were not essential people that could be used to support the existing game. 
---
But the game essential lost gw2 raid and fractal developers and essential WvW developers. The developer that has made a few of the most iconic parts of the gw2 festivals. The most well know community manager in the history of the IP. 
---
If NCSoft wanted to support the game they would fire the excess ppl hired for the new projects and not veteran of developing the game that could immediately jumpo iback into it and support it. This implies new IP focus with different people since the old ones failed them and not support for the existing game.  
---
Oh god, just form a guild of Alumnis so we can recognize you without the Anet Tag!
---
Why did you type all this in an obvious troll post?
---
David, Kelsey, Zach &amp; Grant are also out I'm afraid :( [https://twitter.com/davidryanpaul](https://twitter.com/davidryanpaul)  https://twitter.com/SpacedCadette/status/1100122657180119040  https://twitter.com/zowch/status/1100196114676903936  https://twitter.com/ggspeaksfree/status/1100136498639253504 
---
wat
---
Muh - if u dont wanna play the game just piss off and play another game lol.
---
This is way more than a "slap on the wrist" and there are way more things that we don't know about going forward. In particular when it comes to NCSoft.
---
The way I understand GW2 development works from a financial point of view is that ArenaNet will not handle any of their own profits. Basically the way it was described made it appear as ANet works on a more or less fixed funding from NCSoft, sure they were told to lay people off, but we have no idea what will happen to their funding going forward.
---
The only villain I've felt much attachment to is Joko honestly. I usually love villains. He was a really neat character though. Very punchable. I'm also really fond of the Inquest as a whole but no one from it in particular stands out to me. Unless you count Gorrik and Blish but I really don't.
---
&gt; All the tournaments resulted in a negative impact on the game aftwards,
---
what?!
---
Even outside of that, most money earned for a EA or Activision are from microtransaction to ridiculous amounts.
---
Thank you for all these wonderful years. I hope all of you find a new job soon. You deserve it.
---
south is at  60%????????????
---
now is time to picnic!
---
While I agree with you, I think it's also fair to say that NCSoft most likely pushed to lay off senior members because they cost too much money. I'm all for cancelling moot projects, but people like Matthew Medina belong on the GW2 team, and I don't see Gaile Gray working on side projects considering her position as Community Manager.
---
according to who?
---
Muh is too fat to move to other game
---
This is so sad.  Gaile has been with us since the beginning. I call for a Farewell to Gaile event, again. Long live the Frog. This is all such a shame, for everyone involved. Thank you for everything you have done. 
---
I've raided myself for quite a time, thank you.
---
Also, I'm not blind, and I can see the writing in the wall, here, and in all the other MMOs and their raids. You want to keep insisting something it's fine when it's not, okay, go for it. But then don't come crying when you get shitty events instead of real bosses, and one raid every 18 months or more.
---
It's just sad. 
---
So what? The kind of people who need easy mode raids play fractals at t1 and t2.
---
We know nothing about the other projects being cancelled, worst situation means they will drain further devs from gw2 and put them into them to finally finish.
---
It's the usual ignorance on both the business as well as the development side of the games industry coupled with an emotional response. There is a reason why people are whining about the 5 names they actually have heard before. Because they don't think and just equate these 5 names with the game as a whole. No matter how large the actual team behind them is. Or what their actual roles in the company were.
---
-project cancelled   
---
-more developers will be drained from GW2 to finish it   
---
Damn man have everybody already lost their minds around here? That makes no sense whatsoever. 
---
And downvoted! &lt;3
---
I would say a staff elementalist with cleric gear is a good choice for starter core wvw profession.
---
Now hear me out. A lot of pve players arent used to be under heavy pressure of fighting 10,20..50 players ,or to have lags in case their computers cant handle the stuff on the screen, or follow the commander properly.
---
Cleric gives toughness for more sustain, it gives you a nice amount of power which gets better with the might you get from your squad, and as a core staff ele you have some great ways to heal people,hence healing power.
---
Even tho you arent having a great ammount of power, or often and hard hitting critical hits, staff ele still has a ton of aoes that shows up as big red circles and large meteors falling from the sky to the enemy which ,even tho wont hit them much, will still make them run in the other direction. 
---
And enemy movement control is a big part of wvw. And on top of that you have frozen ground, static field, shock wave and unsteady ground for mass aoe cc.
---
Another option would be core guardian, but you will be focusing mostly on keeping your self alive, while providing boons to others and sometimes protecting them from projectiles.
---
Necros have strong wells and some condi pressure, rangers have a little bit of group support and some dmg via longbow, core revenants can still hit like a truck with his hammer but doesnt offer as much boon sharing as a herald form HoT expansion
---
For the past six months, I've been watching Nerd Slayer's "Death of a game" series, and the most common thread in all the games who've gone belly up over the years seems to be the game company getting investment from investors. As soon as their investment stops returning ever increasing amounts of profit, the game's in danger.
---
Enjoy your 1000000000000 downvotes from the panic train OP, nobody wants to hear your voice of reason around here.   
---
The game was *definitely not* in a good place, or heading in a good direction before. These staff shifts will likely not change much, at least in the short term, but it's a start. 
---
This is really awkward following Blizzard/Activition’s layoffs and the message saying they were seeking positions and condolences. 
---
what do you get out of posting this bull shit?
---
The game was on a slow downward trajectory post-PoF. The light at the end of the tunnel was always Expansion 3, as we knew the rate of content releases was not enough to satisfy many players.
---
The layoffs aren't the event that sparked panic. They are the representation of panic breaking out. Everything revealed relating to the layoffs (moving staff off GW2 attributed to slow progress, GW2 team members moving off the game) reinforced that the downward trajectory was not just a fluke or slow period like pre-HoT.
---
Living Story Season 5 was already going to be less exciting than an expansion, given that expansions are where GW2's population and revenue spikes. Now that we don't know whether Expansion 3 will ever be made, or if there will be anything else post Season 5? And compounded with the fact that many big names are gone, leaving the future and quality of the team and releases into question? That gives people less hope.
---
Tl;dr: They really need that Expansion carrot. The layoffs are damaging to Anet's reputation but can be remedied by exciting new content releases. If players feel that no expansion is coming, and the game will wind down after LS5, then GW2 will continue on that downward trajectory, and the great hopes we have for it continuing and growing in future will be stifled.
---
No. They've cancelled the other projects. 
---
When you have 100 developers, but only really need 50 developers for your projects, smart (and decent) companies start by asking, "we have to downsize, anyone willing to accept this severance package voluntarily?". Gives people who were thinking about switching jobs a chance to come forward first.
---
Common practice and the best option for all involved.
---
can't you let people be sad for a day
---
Im not saying its a good decision. Im saying its the kind of decision a corporation driven by numbers on spreadsheets and run by marketers would make. Streamline costs and keep the features you can easily market and advertise to an outside audience. Maximise cost/income in the short term with no regard to the long term. Gotta make the shareholders happy or they will break you up and leave you with nothing.
---
I was aware of the risk! But someone needed to say it! 
---
Whether the quality of development will improve is another situation entirely. Time will tell. 
---
&gt; Will the same Guild Wars 2 quality be the same as before?
---
The same "quality" like the top notch "quality" of updates to every game mode that is not open world PVE? Like WvW? Like "competitive" PVP (esports worthy (tm))? Like raiding? Like, hey, dungeons?   
---
&gt; Brahm "What do we do now?"
---
Me "I don't know"
---
Yeah, that's the point. The developers who had no clue what to do with the game, and managers who didn't know what to do with the developers, were let go.   
---
What is actual content then? By this standard, no online game in the world fits your standard, no devs can provide players with infinite content. Player will always consume faster than development.
---
Thank you so much! Take a look!
---
The real shame is how much better GW2 could have been if they hadn't divested so many resources from it. R&amp;D into new projects is necessary, and one should expect them to pursue new markets or new games, but not at the expense of their golden goose. It seems they've failed to strike that balance and not only has GW2 suffered immensely from a complete lack of resources (clearly evident over the past several years), but now potentially new income streams (these side projects) have suffered as well.
---
Yes, ANet needed a reality check. What they were doing was ***not*** working.
---
People love drama. Especially on Reddit. It's harder to focus on the positives.
---
Waiting on more downvotes... 
---
Matthew Mercer, from critical role
---
Sounds like many already got it destroyed, so they won't lose much more by taking a couple days.
---
its ok to grieve or feel bad when something bad happens
---
all this reactionism (even while meaning well) isnt always appropriate
---
I'll remember the name of the lfg. ;-)
---
I also used to be passionate about my job (software developer, not games) but 10, 15 or 20 years in the same job makes people weary and it becomes "just another job" for many people.
---
The "too soon" phenomenon.
---
I guess everyone can understand that and sure they are right, but what i dont understand is why they cut actually really good and talented developers and also many community favorites.
---
City of Heroes from Paragon Studio was a top 10MMO back in 2012 and they released content until the last month when people have been laid off, as in such anouncement, then NCSoft announced a timer on the game shut down of a month to let people start packing their shit up. And the game was generating revenues but not enough by the NCsoft standards.
---
You can never be sure NCSoft will not kill a succesful game. 
---
Is this the guy responsible for resetting my fractal rank 2 times and then adding bad instabilities?
---
ANet heavily increased their staff through the years, and now we have confirmation they had 2 major projects on the side. You can bet that most talents were working there too or even solely. Layoffs of those talents are a consequence that makes the most sense for those that can get another job anyway.
---
The restructuring is necessary and we will see how it goes in the next months. As of now, no need to panic. We survived the pre-HoT 9 months content drought, we survived the post-HoT 9 months content drought. We even had MO taking over Colin as Lea d in a job that ideally isn't his. And he still recouped greatly.
---
PoF release was overall a success, we can't deny that, and honestly the LS4 majorly surpasses the previous ones by content introduced. Yeah, mostly one-time content but that's the nature of the game: mostly addressed to casuals. Yet, it was profitable.
---
This was a huge hit, and we lost a lot of voices we knew and heard gratefully, but new voices have to eventually come and as of now we just need to wait what's next. Surely there will be a revamp of the roadmap, and in this particular time on the industry I do have hopes they'll talk to us.
---
I am honestly trying to be objective, and 300 ppl still working on the game ( now 100%, we don't know how many were on those side projects ) is huge. 
---
This is overall sad, but the whole Staff deserves my support as long as I enjoy the game. I will just wait to hear what's coming.
---
Anet is to blame for its failures. Don't blame NCSoft for mopping up the mess. The community's disregard for any criticism as an attack on the developers has led to an incoherent game direction and lack of meaningful, repeatable content.
---
&gt; People should be rejoicing.
---
While I think you're right on what you think was NCSoft reasoning, this is really not the right sentence to close it off.
---
You'd know from my post history that I'm not an ANet employee and that I live in Vegas, not Seattle. :)
---
OTOH if they're looking for a long distance freelance writer...
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Its almost like corporations need to realize infinite growth is toxic and impossible.
---
Well i was so sad yesterday that i felt like to stop playing the game and said fuck and went to Tarrktun...
---
Had 3.6k gold and 10.5k globs, now I'm at 6.2k gold and almost 12k globs...
---
Since yesterday there have been hundreds of post, half of them panic, half of them bitching about those who panic. That is where the downvotes come from, it's annoying.
---
Don't focus on numbers; focus on individuals.
---
The fact that people like Matt Medina and Josh Foreman are the ones leaving, people that have been around literally since Guild Wars: Prophecies, is a clear indication of a real culture change that's taking place within ArenaNet.
---
Is Guild Wars 2 dead? Of course not. Is Guild Wars 2 going to be a very different game moving forward? That's increasingly likely.
---
Do you remember the first time SAB went live? Or when Scarlet was destroying the original maps? Or the first time we've seen Halloween or Wintersday? I really miss this kind of excitement. 
---
What would you want the company to do instead. Keep people on the payroll until there is literally no more money for them? Like companies only have employees because they make money. Employees wouldn't work for no pay so there is no reason companies should keep employees that are loosing them money. 
---
Game developers need to unionize if they want to better conditions, companies aren't there to help you, they only care about you as long as you are worth something to them, just like you only work for companies that pay you.
---
&gt;  Restrusturing and lay offs never bring good things.
---
Yes they can actually if done right, clearly you don't run a business.
---
im not sure on how much David Ryan Paul  was involved with anet did he worked on anet directly or was he mostly a Freelance like lena?
---
&gt;I'm still baffled why people are starting to panic right now. Ncsoft had to tell Anet in unambiguous terms that their development practices were crap and they had to drop the stuff had to drop the stuff that didn't work and focus on the stuff that does.
---
Just take a look at some of the threads on the front page. It seems like many people just can't come to terms with the idea that Anet fucked up bad and ncsoft's just trying to salvage the mess they made.
---
People are shitting on ncsoft like they're the devil that just finished beating up an innocent baby.
---
I don't really understand why players on the GW2 subreddit seem to hate the idea of Anet being forced to shift their focus back to the game we all play instead of wasting a mindboggling amount of time and resources on secret projects that don't go anywhere. If certain developers have no interest in continuing to work on GW2 yet seem to be unable to create anything of substance over years of failed secret projects, it seems understandable that there would come a point where they either get their head out of the clouds and go back to working on the game that is still alive and profitable here and now or make themselves redundant.
---
You can't expect the company to continue to subsidize your failures over and over again just because you did something cool once upon a time.
---
You know how victims of abuse sometimes defend their molesters due to a mix of fear and stockholm syndrome? That's what the comments from many of the people defending Anet read like.
---
You don't propose any alternative. Also it wasn't a strawman because you literally didn't make the argument and I didn't try to alter the appearance of your argument. I gave an alternative and asked you the question. That is not a strawman. 
---
The game's development has felt like a mix of fast food and cheap action movies for a while now.
---
Completely unhealthy for what MMO games need, which is community, replayability, and long-term rewards.
---
It's much easier to develop content for a game like PoE though, I don't think it's comparable. You'd have to compare it to other MMOrpgs 
---
I never used the word 'problem'. Don't put words in my mouth.
---
This is yet another pointless thread. You don' t know what actually happened. You making wild guesses. 
---
I would guess to state your "unpopular" opinion and get up votes to feel popular and right. 
---
Stop guessing. This is heating things up unnessecarily. Either they will tell or they wont.   
---
&gt; It really sucks seeing Veteran players with 280+ Mastery-level, around 30k achievement points and full legendary gear + wings etc. derping around in my T4 dailys. Often times I'm asking myself if they're currently letting their little brother play ~
---
Had a 30k+ AP player in AC storymode earlier, despaired on the gate we all dodge-jumped over. I guess account selling is a thing nowadays
---
Now i want shining blade ._.
---
&gt; Of course veterans of this industry leave a place like this. They know that even worse times are comeing down on the employee's in the following months.
---
Yup. If you see 1/4th of your department get gutted by higher ups, you start looking for a new job. ArenaNet is essentially a department of NCSoft (I know it's not *exactly* the same, but the principle is). Anyone who is worth their salt is looking for something else right now.
---
Ogres slightly (1%) better under 90% hp, much worse over 90% hp
---
You insinuated there was a problem.
---
What else did you mean by saying that "GW2 isn't doing well recently ... perhaps it's time for change"?
---
Literally one of the best GW2 devs. Clear communication, *frequent* communication on Reddit. 
---
I absolutely couldn't tell you the names of the other devs but I always remember this guy talking to people, acknowledging feedback etc.
---
The only way ArenaNet can recover from this is with a huge change of attitude, both in design and in communication, specially communication.
---
**This game needs a roadmap urgently.**
---
No. They are subsidiary, they are 100% dependant on ncsoft.
---
Also, did people forget if not for ncsoft Guild Wars franchise would never exist?
---
&gt; The drama just makes it seem worse, 
---
Caused by the community not NCsoft and Anet. Seriously some people where about to get fired and before we found out how many and who all that was said was "OMG THE GAME IS DOOMED" and that hasn't changed. 
---
No doubt we have players all over the internet telling people not to touch the game now because its dying because of all of this. 
---
The community does far more damage to the game than NCsoft and Anet are doing.
---
So much this, my concern is not the reduction in numbers but who got laid off. 
---
7 years and 2 expansions is not enough. Maybe now they will refocus their agenda.
---
I rember that it took them about three months after HoT to have released more gemstore ticket weapons than the entirety of HoT had.
---
&gt; Having projects cancelled is very bad news, because it means a lot of wasted resources.
---
While it is obviously preferable to not cancel I'd argue this isn't that big of a problem. Blizzard is known to have done it quite a lot, even when they were less successful than now (and yes, they are extremely successful right now).
---
Producing half a game and cancelling is nothing compared to actually launching a failure. It is a smart move it things just doesn't work out. It is only really a big problem if the company is about to die and this project were their last saviour. Then of course you can't just cancel and start something new - but Anet still does have GW2, so they at least got some income meaning they can "easily" afford to cancel and make something more worthwhile.
---
As I said, you're getting downvoted cause there have been 100 other "no panic" posts before. Becoming Spam at this point.
---
you really think 100 people being cut and some people jumping ship is not gonna effect the rest.. They didn't just fire some randoms. a few very high profile members left.
---
I would not surprised in the least if this kicks off a rapid dissension into cancellation
---
You presented an alternative as the only other outcome, and I literally compared NCSoft to a studio that did it right as an alternative.
---
That's a good idea.  Thanks!
---
yeah seen that so many of their friends left, anet future not looks so good anymore with only a 7 year old game in the pipeline and maybe getting payments cut its totally understandable
---
GGG reuses assets and develops content efficiently. ANet does the opposite of that. ANet has to create brand new maps and mechanics for every episode. It obviously doesn't work.
---
I haven't used the official forums since like 2013. Maybe now they'll become a thing to be a part of.
---
Well if you look at the subreddit then the answer is yes.
---
Can this include "hE/sHe WaSn'T aCtUaLlY cOnTrIbUtInG tO tHe GaMe" posts that keep popping up in response to people being upset about particular layoffs?
---
&gt; which unsurprisingly didnt perfectly work out because nothing ever does in game dev
---
Stop making shitty excuses.
---
People volunteering to leave have typically been offered a severance package. I’ve seen these packages range anywhere from 2 weeks of pay all the way up to 52 weeks of pay (paid in one lump sump). Typically, the greater the reward, the more people that accept the offer. Talented software professionals can find jobs rather quickly. Getting extra money while also getting a mini vacation before starting a new adventure is cause for many people to move on to a new environment. Most of these severance agreements are protected by an NDA and an agreement to not say anything negative about the company. That being said, it’s unlikely that you’ll hear about the $$$$ associated with folks that volunteered to go.
---
to be fair almost all mmorpgs arent doing so well atm there are maybe a handful left now who are still pushing it
---
Exactly what I wrote. Players haven't been happy for a while with the content.
---
I never said Josh Foreman was the problem. What a ridiculous thing to insinuate.
---
Or you know...children defending the video game they love with a childlike appreciation of the world. But yeah, real life sucks and at least now there's some hope that focus gets shifted back to the game.
---
Hi, Jumping Puzzle guild here. With Josh Foreman offboard this game IS dead now for me. There will be no more new content for us to play. (sadly there wasn't anything new for us since S3)
---
Developers should care about themselves and unionize in the first place.
---
Obviously. I meant it from a different perspective. Not "ANet is gonna die", but like "that's a lot of money that is not going into developing GW2". Or another product, for that matter. Of course it's the wise and smart thing to do when you see it's not working out. But it will have some impact on us nonetheless.
---
Better than the comments moaning about the moaning eh buddy? :)
---
yeah i never understood why people mindlessly pump so much fk money to abusive mobile companies 
---
&gt; I never said Josh Foreman was the problem. What a ridiculous thing to insinuate.
---
Bro, words are hard for you, or something. I said "If you think people like Josh Foreman were "the problem"...
---
_If_ being the key word here. 
---
No
---
I tentatively agree. If the moving on of some experienced people (as much as it ducks) means a fresh approach and perhaps looking at new ideas, then it could be a silver lining.  
---
The fact that some of the ANet veterans are taking voluntary redundancy (in UK speak) suggests that maybe they’d become jaded and were looking to move on anyway. Fresh blood coming up through the ranks might be a kick up the backside that things need.  
---
(With the caveat that NCsoft doesn’t start meddling)
---
You actually believed that in the first place?
---
THEY ARE A TRULY REMARKABLE SPECIES. THANK YOU FOR THIS INSIGHT, FELLOW NON-HUMAN.
---
Exactly, you're insinuating from my previous comment that I said the staff leaving were the problem. How do you not understand that?
---
&gt; This crisis is just the culimation of the ad hoc and chaotic system that has been going on for some time now. You can argue with my points, maybe you find that the new maps are awesome and the mounts are amazing (I would agree) but the fact that the current state of the game is just not enough, can't be ignored.
---
I'm kinda surprised NCSOFT didn't step in earlier to be fair. Mismanagement has been a constant since release.
---
Oh, for sure. I'm sure they'll all be fine. But to voluntarily leave the company is still an indication that they think they're better off elsewhere than remaining at ArenaNet. That's the more concerning thing.
---
whats the dev/player communication discord?
---
can you link it?
---
Post on forum claimed that shitty API update made it possible to see source ams length of subscription.  Claimed 3,4 million players after bfa launch and 1,7 million few months in. 
---
LMAO
---
Even if they post plans for the future I won't be satisfied until I see some of those plans fulfilled. Anyone can post a plan.
---
Devs from story writing and content like fractals/raids were fired/left so I've no idea how that can be seen as a good thing 
---
Your point, sir, is valid.
---
FF14 says hello.
---
Should mention a new, reasonable grind. Although that's subjective. Personally hate 1-a-day crafting. Even if it was 3-a-day or 5-a-day, I'd be happier trying to complete legendaries and ascended gear. Or even Mawdry. Doing things one day at a time just feels like a chore.
---
Or if we got mini-stories like we did with Gryphon and Roller Beetle mounts. Or Calebog. Rewards don't even have to be mounts or ascended gear (although alternatives to fractals and crafting it would be cool for solo players), classic or even new, cool 'unique' exotics would be nice. I wouldn't mind those being time gated after completing 5 or so steps. I want to invest time, essentially, but I want to do it in a way that doesn't feel like an obligation or actually feel like a grind. Like running dungeons and RIBA maps to hit a certain gold amount.
---
Many of them hadn't been working on GW2 for years. For example, you can tell Josh Foreman was no longer around, since we haven't gotten new jumping puzzles since a few years ago.
---
The sad thing here is that they weren't brought back to GW2, and that whatever they worked in is now in a garbage can.
---
looks fine to me
---
1 example and that's it :)
---
Time to build a space wall then ...  :-D
---
D E L A Y E D
---
Dungeons with high replayability and long-term reward systems could help. New PvP modes could help. Guild upgrades so communities have something to do ingame would help.
---
The problem is they focus all their resources on one-time single player experiences. This is a multiplayer game, those kind of experiences should be secondary.
---
They've been working on those projects since 2013, at least on of them. If nothing comes out of your project after 5 years that's a bad sign. I think they stretched themselves too thin.  
---
One side project would have been fine with some people going to gw2, some to the new project. But they took people out of gw2 and put them to new projects and it went nowhere. That's not a good thing for a company. Cancelled projects are simply wasted money.
---
I'm somewhat out of the loop, but was it ever established that the non-mobile axed project was a separate game? It's entirely possible it was expansion 3 and the plan is to just milk PoF until the boot comes down.
---
if they need  2 days off,instead of taking care of their customers,than there isnt much to add.
---
I mean if you genuinely can't tell the difference between "If you think this..." and "You think this..." then yeah, we're kind of done here.
---
&gt; That is undertandable but sadly, usually those who took the bad decisions about new projects maintain their job. The bosses continue while they charge against they consider that advised badly them. The typical excuse to be not guilty...
---
Do you know what other projects that were? Who initiated them? Why they failed?
---
There is a myriad of reasons why business ventures can fail. And very often it has nothing to do with teh ability of management to keep the company running well. Which they are doing for GW2. It is staying profitable in an extremely difficult market. A market where a lot of competitors are failing.
---
&gt; But at the end you have two options, still support and give money to them and view how they again waste it or not.
---
And again, a claim without any evidence. Based on nothing.
---
Just the usual "Oooh, those evil gaming companies...".
---
By the way, the smart thing is to simply spend money on things you believe are worth it. Doesn't really matter what you imagine the company behind the product to be doing, as long as we are talking about normal businesses that don't rely on things like child labour or similar. Which isn't the case anywhere in the gaming industry as far as I am aware.
---
So if you like future content, buy the game. If not, don't.
---
As for the companies involved. They haven't changed. They are still the same as they have been 5 years ago.
---
Who died?
---
So NC is the new EA?
---
And even if they were willing to sell, it doesn't mean ANet has the money to afford the rights along with all the other long term financial costs they'd have to deal with when switching to self publication. 
---
What about the frog? 
---
I know, Ive used it for fractals before 
---
I can only imagine having walked into an office for about 10 years and pretty much knowing everyone there, having a grand time - and then being let go and not being able to hang out and work with the guys anymore.  
---
Gotta suck.  
---
&gt; oh yeah and keep the higher-ups in the management off course, who where mostly responsible for the failed projects, cause there are surely more important then the hard-working talented underpaid devs
---
Aah, great. Someone who has inside information.
---
So who exactly did initiate these projects? Who was responsible? Why did they fail? And who else was involved?
---
WTF? Why josh? Is he not the guy who did most of the JP and SAB? I know I've not made a lot of JP in a long time, but they where what made me fell in love with the game. Such an amazing guy, I hope he finds a good job soon.
---
&gt;The concept of aim assist and such is because you know....gamers are getting older, some of us are disabled.
---
Point taken. I do not personally expect to be playing at such an age so I guess it is coming from a selfish point of view. It's a good thing to let these people play. Unfortunately, that's how age is, as we get older we get slower. That's life. I don't expect to "keep \[my\] leet gaming skills" past 40, but nor do I wish for something that takes away from playing the actual game such as auto this auto that.
---
Just as my reaction time has decreased to the point where I do not play FPS games anymore, in the same way, I just take it as life is, I'd still rather not play FPS games if auto assist allowed me to. I guess if I want to do something I want to do it on my own merit, that is all. If I can't do it, too bad, just have to move on.
---
Many GW2 players came for a company who pours love into a taboo-breaking game and not for a professional company held to high standards of quality by threats of further layoff. (Well they want quality and a clear direction and consistency too of course.)
---
That the labor of love ended and that GW2 was not their golden child anymore was feared since a long time, the reason behind the layoffs all but proved it and the hard hit it was on the staff itself pretty much sealed the deal.
---
That GW2 is not the golden child of NCSoft either does not lead to positivity either.
---
Now the game will survive, I expect for at least two or three years. Maybe more than it would have otherwise, in fact. We will have fun (at least, those of us who are targeted by the releases). Still, rejoicing seems a bit much to ask.
---
&gt; They released some cool stuff like the Roller Beetle which definitely took a lot of time to develop. But look at the impact it had on the game vs. the development time/costs? Do you see the problem?
---
One of the most recurrent problems with ArenaNet is that they build a lot of new cool systems, but then they're barely usable because none of them have the right playgrounds to shine.
---
Roller Beetles need decent mount races. And no, what we got isn't decent, it's just some checkpoints and speed boosters. We need a whole game mode ala Mario Kart for the beetles to be worth their inclusion.
---
It's like getting a Ferrari but having no roads to drive it in. What's the damn point?
---
&gt;Whoever made these decisions made some very big errors. Very, very big. I wouldn't be optimistic about the game if they didn't change the way they look at developing new content. 
---
I hope NCSOFT gets to shake the guys calling the shots, because they're the main culprits here.
---
&gt;Not sure if American companies have good redundancy/severance payouts
---
Hahahaha.... yeah the rule of thumb in America is, "employer wins, you lose." Severance is almost unheard of outside of executives or other wealthy higher-ups who don't even need it.
---
Man I’m so new that I don’t even know what’s getting spoiled for me
---
WvW large scale battles aren't necesserily "casual" niether they are braindead. It's nothing like big PvE evens (like world bosses) where you can only auto-attack. There are many dedicated playes in WvW large-scale battles, with full equipment and with skill. Sure, casuals can also join these squads, but it doesn't mean that zerg fight is meant for casuals only.
---
Benjamin Phongluangtham?
---
You are right, this is literally the worst time to delay content. 
---
it actually says alot. The reason of the bump in the 2015 was HoT release but the following year revenue went down by over 20$ million. When you look at 2017 (PoF release) and 2018 there's only 2$ million revenue difference.
---
Well i believe the better solution would be for Anet to come clean and transparent on what these projects were. It may gain support and hype for these projects to further the funding from NCsoft to finish them.
---
&gt; Anet was working on a number of other projects/games
---
I'd like to hear what other projects these are/were. It's always been said but I don't know even a single one. 
---
Why!!?? It was one of the only good moderators on the forum.  Why do they fire good people?
---
I completely agree, but we don’t make assumptions based on what we don’t know. We draw conclusions based on what we do know.
---
Dunno why you're getting downvoted, I agree
---
If I just lost my job I wouldn't be thinking 'hm wow better hop in game and take some screenshots for people on reddit' 
---
&gt; that actively worked on GW2 content
---
But where was that content in the last year?
---
When you look at this https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release
---
2018 was a really sad year. Apart from Mythright Gambit and the really low effort rehashs of the Festivals there were only the 3 LS episodes and these were to put it mildly "not great".
---
2017 had 4 LS episodes AND Path Of Fire.
---
It depends on what you want. If you care about story, then get HoT first so you can play it in proper order. PoF if you don't care about that, and you can't wait to get a mount. I would go for HoT personally.
---
*Oooh, shiny*
---
For all we know, NCSOFT might have been warning ArenaNet about these problems for years. Then they got tired of not being taken seriously, and they stepped in in the worst manner possible.
---
Knowing ArenaNet's general attitude, I wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't the case.
---
I mean, when was the last time there was a new JP anyway? You must not have been playing for the past 6-12 months if it's the only thing you do.
---
TBH if all you like is platforming there are better games out there.
---
yikes
---
Nonsense. Barely anyone caring about the story isn't even true for the vocal minority you find here and in the forums. Gw2s population is much more casual heavy than in comparable games, so this statement is even less correct when taking into account all players. 
---
But that was not even my point. I wasn't saying adding fractals or raids was not a good idea, I was pointing out that this observation is so bloody obvious , that the notion that not more of this kind of content being added is for lack of will or understanding, is absurd. Balancing budgets behind different teams, systems, overall projects and content types is more complex than you make it out to be and we have way to little intel to make blanket statements such as yours. 
---
I will forever remember him [because of this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7mhllp/how_do_i_get_rid_of_this_condition/) Best wishes in your future endeavors Cameron, you’ll be missed :(
---
well.. either it dies because anet has other projects (which seemed to fail or there would be no reason to interfere by ncsoft) or they try to get back into a better state or it dies when they fail this.
---
so we as players can choose between a death for sure and a chance to survive..
---
I like your ideas!
---
I've seen some people here in Reddit say they won't touch raiding but want to because gearing up, learning rotations is too much effort. Anet trialed a solution to this by the op food, armour and weapons in the last living world story.n
---
Personally when I started I never wanted to do CMs, but getting bored of normal raids, I started doing CMs. Easy mode raiders can transition to normal raids the same way maybe?
---
I've seen others say finding a group is hard.
---
A daily raid boss helps with finding a group (works for fractals)
---
You're making it sound like people died, chill out a bit 
---
&gt; I'll eat your downvotes at the same time
---
Only one of me. If other people are downvoting then that clearly tells you something.
---
long term employees are always the first to get booted in lay offs since they get paid more, so that companies can keep the underpaid ones 
---
&gt; We don't need a new map every 3 months.
---
Maps are fine. Look at Silverwastes, 5 years later and it's still one of the game's best pieces of content.
---
Point your fingers at the story instances, those are the actual black hole for resources.
---
Thanks for the list with their positions. It's good to know what were these people responsible for before NCSoft decided to screw them over.
---
400 isn't an incoherent number, you need to have ppl maintaining servers, HR, accountants, layers, marketers...
---
Telltale games used to have 250 ppl and they were just making (good) offlines adventure games...
---
May be too late. How likely is an expansion after LS5 given that all side-projects were scrapped? Maybe Anet didn't count Expansion 3 as a side-project and it is still in development. Even then why haven't they said as much given that the confidence in the future of GW2 fell off a cliff with the firings. And if they have an expansion in the works the recent events does not inspire confidence for a stable release cadence for future content and LS's. With a 3rd expansion in 2020 at the earliest they should already have a future (non-GW2) project deep in development as GW2 is by all accounts in its halcyon days. Now, any potential future projects have been reset and will probably be 3-4 years away at the earliest. Do not see how Anet are supposed to recover from this.
---
Well a lot of the early restriction in GW2 was bad from my perspective. No raids,  no mounts,  no expansions, no anything as long as WoW did it. That's a bad mindset to have as lead person in charge of a MMO. There are still bad decisions in the game but at least the game has improved much.
---
Ben and Josh ... oh boi, even darker days for gw2 incoming..
---
That other people can't read or interpret very well?
---
Yes, unfortunately. I know that all too well.
---
No more Polymock on mobile dreams :(
---
913 &lt; 80 ?
---
I mean it's not at the bottom compared to other MMOs but you can see where the money is coming from.
---
I don't think the game will die, but I do think we may see some changes in either the amount of content or the quality of the content for the game.
---
So a lot of this is up in the air. 
---
Gw2 would really shutdown
---
Oh my.
---
Thanks for sharing that thread again.
---
Eesh. Being serious now, if you're having a bad day I'm free to chat. Let's leave this now, it's not doing anyone any good.
---
The Living World thing has been cancerous for this game.
---
Had they focused on pure content since day one, pushing new zones and dungeons (story instances being secondary or nonexistent) the game would have been a total success years ago.
---
It took almost 4 years to get the first expansion, and it was far from the amount of content an expansion was supposed to give.
---
That makes no sense.
---
As you said yourself, the guy hasn't made any jumping puzzles in years. 
---
How does him leaving affect anything whatsoever?
---
If anything, there's now a chance for more content since there should be more people working on the game.
---
Nobody is going to ask a single player when anet's life is going to be debated by their owners.
---
How much does GW1 make them still?
---
&gt; 'Good' repeatable content is a myth imo, it's only good for a short amount of time.
---
?
---
History of gaming proves that people want good repeatable content time and time again tho. RTS age, MOBAs, Card Games and now BRs. Heck, PoE - one of the most grindy games out there - is in top 15 most played games on steam. 
---
Absolutely we took a huge damage here, but I still want to focus on the fact that we don't know what's ahead. New talents can emerge after this situation, especially after a restructuring. We had very low expectations for MO as Game Director, but it recouped after some months with LS3 ( even if we took the huge toll of a content drought ).
---
Honestly, the biggest problem about the community management was always here: lack of individuals and communication of a detailed roadmap. This might change, but it's just assumption as of now.
---
They didn't lie, they said it wouldn't affect gw2 services. Which can mean as little as the servers won't be turned off, characters won't be deleted etc. They basically said nothing.
---
What the hell?
---
The videogame industry is already bottom-tier for programmers. We need more quality and better job conditions if we want the best of the best working here.
---
We're seeing top managers go away with millions every year, while the workforce is treated like garbage, and you see we don't need improvements?
---
Don't worry though, the AAA crash is coming, and the problem will fix itself anyway, the hard way.
---
From a practical standpoint, that is unsustainable, especially if said maps are free.  I would have been absolutely fine with 2 or 3 episodes per map, similar to SW and Dry Top.  Plus it spreads out your population too much and frustrates latecomers who need difficult achievements and can't fin the people.  I personally am 2 or 3 episodes behind on LS4 and I don't even go for achievements anymore.  I do the story stuff, finish the map for a shot at a key, and move on.
---
well i dont think all those game devs did either initiate  the projects or manage it and anet doesn't really have that many working management so you can see it yourself
---
Thats actualy pretty funny and sad at the same time
---
&gt; of the GW2 player base actually raid, the majority of the player base are bad players who don't want to invest time into finding a training group. Fractals ease you in with T1, 2 and 3. Raid has no such easing in and so people just don't bother.
---
This hits the nail on the head. Training requires significant scheduling, and the game has no way to ease you into raids, unlike fractals. 
---
 How appropriate. You fight like a cow. 
---
I would be rejoicing if they were folding the people from the failed projects back into GW2.  Instead, they laid them off.
---
This whole sad Story puts our petty little quarrels with the game into perspective.
---
That's a good question. I don't know about the US but here in Canada there is a couple a ways a co-op can get funding. You can still get loans as a co-op the same ways corporation do, but in the end when you refund the loans  that's it: you don't owe the loaners part of your future profits. 
---
I don't know if it would work as a brand new game company, but I feel that switching to a co-op model when a corporation feels one of its branch is not profitable enough (even if it's enough to self-sustain) is an option that should be considered  more often. Workers should have a right to take back their workplace. And all the money that used to be sent as dividends could instead be reinvested as salaries, in the game, in the production of an xpax, etc. 
---
The imperative of always having to produce more profits for shareholders can kill perfectly healthy compagnies that otherwise create enough surplus to be able to pay for it's salaries and own development cost. . 
---
also i cant image they would describe like: "josh foreman - guild wars mobile" LOL, so ofcoz they used theirs old jobs
---
Dhuum CM and Samarog CM are probably the only CMs which are significantly more difficult than their normal encounter. 
---
dont hold your breath =\]
---
I think it's a mix of 3 collectives:
---
* Elitist idiots who don't have fun if they can't feel better than everyone else.
---
* Fanboys who will defend anything coming from ArenaNet.
---
* Raid sellers who profit off this situation.
---
Raids will die if they don't evolve and become accessible for everyone (casuals, dedicated, and hardcore). Because we don't just need easy mode, we need hard mode too.
---
This isn't rocket science indeed, specially when PRETTY MUCH EVERY OTHER MMO has gone through this phase already.
---
Pic or it didn't happen... lol JK. But a pic of this would be nice
---
And then do what, shut down? Arenanet really isn't known for their ability to sustain a business. They have heart, yes and they're apparently really nice to work for ... but that doesn't make money. That's why the layoffs happened in the first place.
---
They probably also got a sweet ass severance package for volunteering too.
---
Fuck sake its not been 24 hours since the firings, so what do you expect them to do? 
---
People need to chill the fuck out, it was a surprise for Anet and they had to pick 100 people to fire, what their future projects are and telling the community what the plans are take a back seat. 
---
They will communicate in time but demanding it at the minute you hear something "new" is ridiculous.
---
Benjamin Arnold, Paul Ella are "dead weight "?
---
ok then
---
No. Why should one? 
---
I mostly agree with Akhevan, but I don't think "rejoicing" is the word to use. I think "optimistic for the future of ANet/GW2" would be better. We've certainly got more devs on GW2 now, and if both projects were progressing so slowly that they warranted being cancelled then devs across the board either had too high of a workload and/or there was too much wasteful spending.
---
We shouldn't ever celebrate good people losing their jobs, but this certainly is a good sign for the future.
---
&gt; There is no personal performance required from each individual player
---
The more skilled the players are, the better the squad performs. Those who just auto-attack are dead weights that serve as rally bots, resulting in actually doing harm to the squad rather than helping. WvW is a competitive game mode. You aren't against AI that can't think. You need to outsmart actual people.
---
&gt; but you're following them mindless 
---
The commander exists for coordination, just like the maestro in an orchestra. For the reasons I stated above, being in a squad is far from mindless. The quality of your performance is up to you, not up to the commander.
---
Agreed. It's sad to look at LFG and the only things happening in season 3 and 4 maps are istan and leather farms. Meanwhile, 100 year old SW RIBA content still has groups every day.
---
Panic? No. Savour the remaining time before the end? Yes.
---
It really is that simple.
---
Is the game still good for you? Then keep playing.
---
If you care too much about the future then wait and see the new structure, it might not look promising now but give the new structure a chance, the company wants to make money and if they kept 300 employees then they obviously think the game is still very much alive.
---
If not, then just move on.
---
I quit pre HoT and never really came back like before, just came back for the story and some WvW at some point, I loved the game and have very fond memories with it but such is the life of games, if you're bored of it and don't like the direction it is going, then stop and move on, no need to overreact and panic.
---
Am I wrong or did Anet not announce that they were moving to an expansion-&gt;LW-&gt;expansion cadence around the PoF-announcement? When did they change from that to again move to an unsustainable and irregular LW cadence like in the "we will never have expansions"-days?
---
How else do we keep the subreddit safe and secure for "all" users?
---
Discussions and arguments just lead to toxicity.  Mindless circlejerking while avoiding disagreements leads to a much nicer community. 
---
Not fully yet, but there are constant additions to Wine with each release.
---
Considering most people who only played in 2012 still use the same old talking points when talking about why it's bad in various internet discussions it just shows that marketing the game and how it's evolved over the years hasn't been good. Something we all knew.
---
I'm still surprised that whenever I bring it up I can count on at least one person bringing up stuff that is no longer relevant as a rebuttal or question.
---
do you have problems logging into the game?
---
Four healers, like a Druid/2x Firebrand/Renegade squad with all healing with a banner warrior and 6 power heralds would probably be an extremely safe composition. You have healing, all necessary boons, unique buffs, and a class whose rotation is 99% auto attacking. Maybe throw in scourges instead on bosses where condi is better for barrier and there you go, unless people are extremely ad, people shouldn't be going down. 
---
down down down u go ... shipping down the vote ...
---
Goddammit.  Now it looks like I'll never get to see the end of this season.
---
I feel we need at least 5 more unpopular opinion threads and probably 6 threads that tell people everything will be fine.
---
In all seriousness, we just dont know what will happen and its useless to speculate about anything untill some clear communication comes out from Anet.
---
The ball is in their hand now and only time will tell what will happen.
---
In 2012 around GW2 launch anet had ~250-270 ppl and they were making ~150m $ per year, in 2018 they had 400 ppl on board, they were making ~70m per year and there wasn't any sign that their new project are moving in some serious direction which means that they can't expect to bump up their revenue at best keep it around current level. For NCSoft it's just business and while on personal level it's sad and painful it's pretty clear that they had to cut the cost. They couldn't keep a team that is bigger than wow team just with gw2 on board and clearly they scrapped whatever they were working on
---
can I have a link to the source document ?
---
All of these people that are screaming that this is the end almost seem like they WANT it to be the end. They get on reddit, read a couple posts, see a couple tweets, and a lot of them are acting on this like they've been waiting for a good reason to jump ship for a long time and this is it.
---
Yes, this is all terrible news. At the end of the day this company is still a company and they're going to bounce back and do what they have to in order to keep the game alive and keep money coming in. 
---
With that being said, I'm going to continue to play and support the game that I love.
---
There are still many players who mainly play the game for the raids, even if they're not many there's not much other challenging PvE content to do in the game. My guild is mainly a raid guild and I'm afraid it'd fall apart without any new raids. 
---
17k more and we can take back our crown from FFXIV online as second largest MMO sub reddit.
---
&gt; 'Good' repeatable content is a myth imo, it's only good for a short amount of time. What people really want is something completely new every week or so, which ain't gonna happen.
---
And when I write that, I face a wall of "hsssss, shut up". Sad.
---
Are you retarded?
---
[This: Merging with NCWest, who made the decision, and why](https://www.pcgamer.com/arenanet-lays-off-a-number-of-employees-ahead-of-ncsoft-west-merger/)
---
Ah, mb. Thought you said druid x2
---
Also lbr, NCSoft is not good about selling the rights to their stuff even when they have people trying, see CoX.
---
Yeah, I had no self control yesterday, not proud of that
---
Welcome to the guild wars Sub where calmness and reason are foreign concepts. Well done for saying it though it needed sayi g because panic will just cause more panic and that would shut the game down faster than loosing 100 devs
---
The only way we will know this is by going a year into the future and look back at the content and patches GW2 have recieved since today.
---
Unfortunetly, the time machine technician was fired last year. He was a waste of time.
---
WHAT ABOUT SUSAN?!
---
Me too I was excited for the probablity of a new chest Tuesday but I guess next week :/
---
chained to the desk
---
Give me an expansion and I give you money.
---
Oh, right. And then we find his eyes which are actually gemstones. Phyrexia attacks but we manage to build the ultimate weapon to kill most of them but sustain heavy casaulties. Then we help mend the magic so it doesn't blow up, but as a result all planes... Uhh... Players are powered down. And we can't go to the mists anymore.   
---
Wait did I jumbled up franchises again? 
---
I'm with you on this one. Radio silence on everything but the most casual of pve... just isn't working.
---
no from me until they tell us what's happening with the future of the hand
---
Please explain how it's a "massive resource sink"? The raid team isn't even large.
---
On top of that, raids are much more repeatable compared to a 2 hour story instance. So even if "only a tiny fraction of the player base" is ever going to see it, I bet it gets played way more in total compared to living story instances.
---
Raids are pretty much the reason I still log in every day.
---
quick edit:
---
https://i.imgur.com/QQCawZ9.png
---
**DO NOT DO THIS.**
---
I personally haven't spent a dime since they first announced mount adoption licenses. I had a gut feeling it would come down to this and I've been right thus far. I'm not spending a cent unless they change their tactic and communication plans with us, and so far they havent. All I see is more skins in gemstore, which sometimes I've caved in and bought with gold &gt; gems, but never rl money. You throwing money at them will not help because they need a good shake up in my opinion. And voting with your wallet is the best way to get the message through.
---
I said they haven't been.
---
Wat
---
I would rather Anet monetize mount-skins and fluff than gameplay-related core-systems like fractals. How do you propose they monetize WvW, fractals etc? Selling Fractal-passes and WvW damage-boosters and gear?
---
The reason why we're seeing the rise of GaaS are the balloning costs and dev-times of AAA-games, an unsustainable situation caused much by the AAA-publishers themselves. It is no longer feasible to release AAA-games as a 60€ one-off. It is also why RPG's are becoming rare beasts, with it becoming more an indie-genre crowdfunded and developed by old guard nostalgists who want a traditional experience. Same with MMORPG's. Only a few years ago every AAA-publisher/dev had the next WoW-killer in the making, now most new ones are EverQuest-inspired indie-affairs crowdfunded on Kickstarter. 
---
We haven't gotten proper response from ANet since forever. Radio silence for everything but most casual content of the game just isn't working. (LS updates if anyone's wondering)
---
No, not really.
---
It's most likely that the positions associated with the canceled projects were eliminated entirely, not folded back into the Guild Wars 2 team. GW2 devs that left probably did so to allow other developers to remain employed. ArenaNET is going to be suffering a certain amount of 'brain drain', because the staff that have left are likely to be more skilled (because this translates to greater career mobility) or experienced/senior (i. e. closer to retirement). Many people assigned to the canceled projects will simply leave the company.
---
The other problem is that unannounced projects represent potential revenue streams that will now go unrealized. This is probably a substantial opportunity cost for ArenaNET's *future*, because it cuts off potential revenue streams that could prop up the company as GW2 fades. Although that means a stronger focus on GW2 in the short term, it makes the long term prospects look riskier.
---
All of this ignores the effects a layoff and reorganization has on short-term morale and productivity.
---
It's possible that this is the right decision, and getting ArenaNET refocused on GW2 means both greater profitability for NCSoft and a brighter future for GW2 and ArenaNET. But, I think it's reasonable to see this as a move that benefits NCSoft's Q1 at the expense of ArenaNET's future.
---
Well since you felt like stopping the game anyway, I assume you won't mind sending that to me 
---
&gt; which sometimes I've caved in and bought with gold &gt; gems, but never rl money
---
Then you support the system. Because it only exists (with a satisfiying ratio) as long as other people buy gems and convert to gold.
---
Every developer should be enforced by law to release the code of a product when they shut it down. Except for those parts they are actively using on their other live projects. Otherwise, each shutdown impoverishes humanity.
---
But that's wishful thinking. Going back to the question, yes it's time to make a private server software because tomorrow may be too late. Sadly making software is not my area.
---
Oof. An apt comparison.
---
The game won't die overnight for sure, and may continue going for years. But doom and gloom is the appropriate response:
---
Aside from losing many developers, the speed at which it was done strongly implies that NCSoft told Anet to lay off anyone not working on the live game. This implies two things - one, that NCSoft are morons who don't think that making games requires talent; and two, that they are exerting more control over the company.
---
Given that this was not done to save a struggling game, but to make a successful one more profitable we have reason enough to be depressed about the game's future - we can probably expect more monetisation, and are unlikely to see any increase in quality. 
---
You mean the part where it looks like we are up against impossible odds, manage to rally a little bit of hope and get skewered in the end anyway? Ya...
---
That's just it, though. The Guild Wars 2 services are as you describe. The ability to log in and access the existing service as laid out in the TOS. They basically just said 'Guild Wars 2 is not being shut down.' That's all.
---
RIP any last bits of hope of anymore S.A.B. content.   At least he was able to give us what we currently have.
---
Skritt math!!
---
Nope
---
I get what everyone is saying, but i see a lot of comments that are “this game is dead”, and stuff like that, but honestly we dont know anything, and pretty much every scenario has the same likelyhood. 
---
Did the devs who left say anything about the state of the game? Or what the canceled projects were?
---
From everything I’ve seen in gaming over the last 25 years, I’m wondering if 20 years from now, or more likely 40 years from now, GW1 &amp; GW2 will simply be ROMs that you play on an emulator.
---
They may even have a Wii hack for it.
---
GW2 was profitable. It was doing fine, and long term investment is necessary to fund next year's breakout hits. It sickens me how people are using this opportunity to trot out their pet issues, as if their ideas would have instantly and definitively been more profitable in the long term...."See, see, if they just hadn't focused on outfits as much / if they had given us more raids / if they had brought dungeons back / if they released maps more quickly, none of this would have happened!"
---
Bullshit. The game has been releasing content nearly continuously (for, what are we at, six years?) with two major hiatuses for reorganization. Does everyone remember when we went **straight** from Season 3 into PoF? Anyone remember that hype, how amazed we were that they were able to pull that off? They did that, **and** they were planning for content one, two, three years in the future by putting team members there. Season four had one big disappointment in Gandara, but other than that it's consistently felt like some of the best story content, and some of the most rewarding and unique open world content, the game has ever seen.
---
But it apparently wasn't good enough. And instead of giving ANet an ultimatum ("Put these people back on GW2, postpone these other projects, and show progress in a year"), NCSoft chose to just force them to axe staff? Why the hell would you do that? Why would you look at employees with decades of experience and say "Yeah, you're on the wrong project, time to go!" It was heavy handed, short-sighted, asinine management from NCSoft. 
---
Screw everything about this situation. Screw NCSoft, screw everyone trying to turn this into an "I told you so", screw this wild uncertainty about the game's future, but also screw the idea of calming down. No, no, ANet had my trust, NCSoft never did, and if they're interfering to this degree for the first time in goddamn **years**, they're going to have to earn my trust. 
---
I believed ArenaNet would fix a subpar product? Yeah fuck me huh
---
It's private for anet devs and guild leaders.
---
This one goes a long time ago when they did talk about whats on the table and what they are trying to work on, and then every patch after patch it backfired back at them.
---
And then they decided to go with the "show ,not tell" mind set.
---
But thats not the type of response im talking about, and you cant really compare this situation with "not talking about the next expansion or raids".
---
OP is wrong, the game is dying, so give me your stuff.  
---
You'd most certainly be right! Thank you guys for the help, there is a 50 EUR bundle, so I might be joining real soon :D 
---
&gt;	What our (hypothetical) inevitable loss against the Elder Dragons is a metaphor for GW2's eventual shuttering?
---
#OMG
---
#NCSOFT IS KRALKATORRIK!
---
Unless they renovate the engine of GW2 instead making a new one.
---
My biggest concern is more of the “who”than the number. Very established, good, developers and community facing people left or fired. Sure their salaries are definitely higher than entry level people, but not having that continuity doesn’t sit well.
---
Here's a list I made a few days ago:
---
&gt;Multiple instances of this happening. Off the top of my head:
---
&gt;
---
&gt;* Claw Island, from the Personal Story, could have been a new zone or a dungeon.
---
&gt;* The fight against Zhaitan could have been a map meta-event in its own zone, instead of a story dungeon.
---
&gt;* The Ancient Karka, Labyrinthine Cliffs, Toxic Kessex Hills, the Twisted Marionette, and Battle for Lion's Arch could have been permanent content.
---
&gt;* Glint's Lair during LW2, could have been a dungeon.
---
&gt;* Hearts and Minds, HoT's final mission, could have been a boss gauntlet dungeon.
---
&gt;* Caudecus's Manor in LW3-4, story instance that used a dungeon map, should have been a dungeon in the first place.
---
&gt;* Kesho and Kormir's Library, both halfway through PoF, could have been fully-fleshed dungeons each.
---
&gt;* Beast of War, PoF's final mission, could have been a map meta-event.
---
&gt;* Fahranur, the First City in LW4-1, could have been a dungeon.
---
&gt;* The assault on Rata Novus in LW4-2, could have been either a dungeon or a map meta-event.
---
&gt;* Both Gandara and the fight against Joko in LW4-3 could have been either a dungeon or a map meta-event.
---
&gt;* Kralkatorrik's fight in LW4-5, could have been a map meta-event.
---
&gt;Look at the amount of wasted locations and animations, just for "play once and forget" experiences.
---
New zones are not the problem, when they spend the same or more on story instances.
---
You're missing the three fractals released in the 14 months between Nov 2017 and Jan 2019. Plus the fractal rework, 5 legendary weapons, new additions to the festivals including the halloween rollerbeetle instance, the Snowmen mini-raid, Sun's Refuge (sadly not utilized enough, but obviously a ton of work), and Hall of Chains was released in Nov 2017 so if I'm expanding my window a little I should include that as well. 
---
Another unpopular opinion but ANet as a developer hasn't been the same since Jeff Strain and co. left to start Undead Labs.
---
But they didn't said that, did they?
---
They said that GW/2 services will continue and that LWS5 is still coming.
---
People are jus smoothing the edges way too much I think.
---
&gt;uncertainty among the playerbase spins out of control rather than something concrete anet have done.
---
I disagree, because I think this uncertainty is a direct consequence of something ArenaNet has done, or rather hasn't done. For years. 
---
If I had a roadmap for the future of Guildwars 2 right now, I honest to god wouldn't be worried in the slightest, because literally all information we have points to the game doing fine as it is. But the fact that all we know about the future of this game is "Living World season 5 is coming" is laughable. Of course people are uncertain, when they have shied away from confirming a third expansion for more than half a year now. For all I know season 5 could be the end of GW2 and them moving on to another game entirely. 
---
This uncertainty is not the players fault and as much as we like to spin shit, it's not NCSofts fault. It's Anets fault for not communicating about the future of their game. Ever. 
---
Yepp, this. I've spent hundreds, if not over a thousand on the game since returning this past September. Not another cent until we get a roadmap and they can stick to it.
---
I spent money on too many failed or sinking titles until the very last moment when it was revealed they were being shut down or put on maintenance mode (Gigantic, Paragon, Deadbreed, HotS) and I'm not about to do it again. Anet cleans up their act or I make a clean break *before* the announcement that the game is ending.
---
Not necessarily, you can use dailies and guild activities to promote different maps every day.
---
no.
---
I don't wanna sound like a jerk, but shutting down the whole office for days to "say goodbyes" is unprofessional. Pushing back updates by a week is unprofessional,  especially since pushing back GW2 content is part of the reason of these layoffs. I mean not that long ago Blizzard dismissed 800 employees (which was a mess of it's own and a shit move imo) but did they shut down for days to say goodbye - no.
---
Reusing assets is not looked down on in an isometric old school dungeon crawly kind of game like PoE. I do not think reusing map assets would be very appreciated in a game like GW2, where the art has always been one of the biggest draws. 
---
Anyway, they're totally reusing assets where they can already. Karka turned into riftstalkers, you know? 
---
Sure, I would love new guild missions and dailies.
---
Yes, that ben
---
From a business standpoint, I completely understand your thought process. I wouldn’t have worded it quite the way you did though. But that’s just semantics.
---
&gt;	Thank you, NCSoft for giving Anet the reality check.﻿
---
I know this is a stretch, but you don’t happen to be from North Korea?
---
Compared to dungeon, fractals, raids you don't have a chance to get rid of those players tho. In PvE you can simply kick a poorly ~~garbage~~ performing player from your team if he can't increase after several wipes.
---
In WvW you're forced to play with them and so they're "actually doing harm to the squad rather than helping" -- as you said.
---
Personal skill in not and was never required to participate in a zerg.
---
Its also not required in PvE but groups can kick and filter low dps etc.
---
You have no control over your WvW zerg. Who is participating, wich equip are they using and are they effective.
---
You have no control.
---
Thats a fact.
---
They aren’t getting a penny until I see some change. What I’m looking for is a statement from MO/Z giving us a roadmap of what is the plan. If patches are going to remain every 3 months, that’s just not good enough.
---
Hahahaha, no.
---
I would agree ... BUT this assumes that there will be a renewed focus on GW2 development. I doubt it. Even if there is short term, I would guess this spells the beginning of the end for Anet.
---
Think about it. Why do developers have publishers? Why not just make the game and put it out there and not be in some evil corporate publishers pocket? Developers need cash flow. It's the same reason an author needs a "publisher" for a book. The publisher fronts most of the cost. It's an investment relationship.
---
One possible interpretation here ... If NCSoft is no longer investing money into Anet's development of other projects then they are basically saying they are done with them. They will let GW2 wind down and that will be that.
---
The good news is that I think GW2 is still doing well enough that it won't get shut down for a long while!
---
&gt;History of gaming proves that people want good repeatable content time and time again tho
---
Precisely what I said. You're chasing a carrot. People are never satisfied, it's our nature. The only way to appease people is to continually put out content (good content) faster and faster, which isn't possible.
---
Not this season though.
---
Every episode takes longer and longer and yet doesn't feel larger in scope. It culminated with Episode 3 being a complete shitfest and IMO by far the worst open world map they have done since release.
---
WvW has been barely touched in ages and as far as I am aware only two devs actually work on it full time.
---
PvP is more or less on life support
---
One throwaway fractal every six months is hardly enough, and the last one was not even remotely fun
---
We got the first three raid wings in seven months, while the next three took over two years.
---
No expansion in sight and it's under question if a third one will ever come.
---
And now this.
---
  ***The studio's goal was to create a fundementally new game within the genre of MMO while doing away with the old school game mechanics, ideas and presentation*** 
---
And that's a problem. Why do that when people LOVED GW1? Why start focusing on other projects like ANet did \[even when they had the huge advantage of NCSoft trusting them so much that they gave them full control of the game\] when it was clear the GW2 fanbase was not happy?
---
As horrible as this is, in the end, it was necessary since ANet, for some ungodly reason, wanted to focus less on the game and more on their other side projects when they quite simply couldn't.
---
Each season should have a daily category, where its maps and current events are in rotation. Said dailies should be interesting, and give a bonus reward for full completion.
---
What do we have now? Dailies for all maps at once, with bad rewards and boring goals.
---
Does NCsoft have the experience to tell ANet what to do profitably? Their MMO sphere experience comes from Wildstar amd that wasn't run very well.
---
Some of these people volunteered, so I wouldn't be surprised if they simply didn't want to work on the game (or for the company) anymore.
---
I don't want to be super-optimistic here, but there's no reason to panic either. GW2 has been in a strange, semi-maintenance state for the last year and it can't get far worse. I mean, sure, they could go full p2w way, but this kind of monetization doesn't seem to work very well outside of Asia.
---
And from my own, personal perspective, they should either put the game in maintenance mode or focus on it. Right now the limbo that came after PoF is really killing the game for me.
---
Did Jeremy leave on his own? I don’t remember. I think Maklaine has done a great job.
---
Why would we want to give people control over who might be stalking them, am I right?
---
It's not like this has been a problem since 2012! /s
---
People dont care about company. They care about the game and if they dont get balance patches and more content they will move to different game. As simple as that. Now its upto arenanet and ncsoft to deal with this. Its harsh but thats how the world works.
---
I am just saying that skill is required to be affective, otherwise you wipe. Same goes for a low skill raid squad for example, but not for a world-boss squad. Skill isn't required to play it, but you will wipe if you don't have it.
---
I'm a pretty PvE-centric scrub and I have to agree. New Elite specializations, new metas that aren't dead-on-arrival, new game mechanic (if glider and mount are any indication of future expansions), handful of new fractal, new enemy types and/or variants, etc.
---
And even the more casual stuff, like new Ranger pets to find and collect, a handful of new cosmetics to seek out, and a fresh assortment of new achievements to burn through.
---
"No money until we know what's comming next" (exactly the opposite of what the OP wanted, ironic). 
---
I don't understand these guys. Why would the current circumstances stop you from spending money to the game? I mean it's not like the game shuts down tomorrow or something like that, not at all.
---
You want a "roadmap", want to know what happens next. But we already know! LS4 and LS5 right after that. Anet already told us, that nothing will change in this plan, everything will come with the same quality, and in the same regularity.
---
We already got the information about LS5 before, that's more than a year of content, around two years from the first announcement. So we already have informations about the next 1-2 years of the game, that's a pretty great span of time. 
---
And we got the confirmation that nothing will change in these plans.
---
You already *know* what you demand here.
---
&gt;Not until we know whats coming in the future.
---
We know.
---
&gt;I can’t recommend anyone spend any money on this game until a statement from Mo comes out discussing the future of the game.  
---
We got a statement about the future of the game. MO doesn't have to discuss the future with *us*, he has to make the descisions. He doesn't need our agreement.
---
&gt;No more cent until roadmap
---
We know the plan for the next 1-2 years.
---
What you demand is already here, except for those ppl who demand another expansion, but you even know that the earliest date is after LS5, which is in ~1,5 years. So you know how long it takes and you should know that they won't announce an(other) expansion 1,5 years before release.
---
As far as I remember, he left to do ESO for a while and then Everquest Next. The latter worked out well!
---
Personally, I'm not keen. Soule has epic music down to a tee imo.
---
To be fair, Jeremy Soule is a complete pile of trash and GW2's music has honestly sounded more unique since he left. Jeremy is/was very one note as far as his music.
---
It's a huge shame, no one can deny that much. I'd like to think that the management at ANet is competent enough to keep on talented staff who can only improve the game. No matter who is let go, it'll always suck.
---
I'd be easier to buy most of NCSoft stock, split ANet, make ANet private, and sell off the rest of NCSoft. 
---
Not that doing that would be easy at all.
---
You are in the a wrong place if you were looking for logic and common sence
---
I can tell you now for future reference, Reddit is the last place where you will find those
---
I need to buy weed today
---
Nice try Anet.
---
People like to panic.
---
"Shake it off!"
---
$50 all at once it's a little too much for me. I prefer to keep buying gems every now and then, like I always do.
---
Workers can't make good games if they're worried they can't make the game any more.
---
Then please, tell me. I'm all ears. Actually really interested to know all the details you seem to have.
---
And the game devs were fired because they simply weren't needed anymore. That's how companies work. They need someone to do something and pay him/her to do that. If they don't need someone to do something, they stop paying them. How is it that so many people still don't get this very simple fact?
---
I can't believe they fucking cut Galie. I'm goddamned PISSED now. Anet needs to fucking get freed from NCSoft, those assholes are going to murder this game just like they murder everything else they touch that isn't Lineage 2. 
---
But these numbers are worldwide. So even with Korea AION and lineage 2 have weaker sales.
---
It is unprofessional tho. While I agree that pushing back content was probably not the reason (I assume you guys were bleeding funds somewhere tho) this is not a reaction you should have. You have to try and keep the player's trust and hope in you. 
---
Right now delays and silence do the exact opposite, and the longer you stay that way the more it shows the players you are not ready to face certain challenges of the corporate world. Layoffs are a thing that happens every day everywhere, mass layoffs are a lot rarer but they still happen and the company should be ready for it.
---
Yes it sucks that your friends won't be working with you anymore, it sucks that they are now out of a job, but here's the thing, right now management is risking losing even more people, losing more jobs by not reaching the player's expectations. You can meet your friends on the weekend, HELL, do releases, make a roadmap and THEN once it calms down do take a few days off.
---
Anet is a corporation first, this is not a daycare and people did not die.
---
you are staying with ArenaNet?
---
*shrug* I pulled this from NCSoft's investor site.
---
No, not THE Ben. :(
---
Surely but it still is worrying that some of the most experienced and talented people at Anet are leaving, it would be truly naive to ignore how impactful that would be for the future. Especially when we’re talking about senior devs who understand better than anyone how to manipulate the engine or coding. 
---
I’m not against new blood but I’ve been following this game since prerelease and the situation is quite gloomy with all the context and history. The game isn’t dying but the future look to be barren of meaningful updates and innovations. Think about the overly-requested build templates feature, I think news like this week mean we won’t be seeing like this with how difficult it has seem to be for them to work on for varied reasons. Losing senior devs make these things even less likely to be considered worth the hassle and more likely to continue on this trend of just keeping things afloat. 
---
To me, this means we’re in more than maintenance mode but there is absolutely no hope of things growing. I’m expecting same formulaic content even past season 5 if they can sustain themselves like this but nothing more which is very worrying as someone who is more into other aspects of the game (neglected ones already). 
---
I had said friday that the layoffs could have benefits to them but seeing who is departing has taken that optimistic hope away. 
---
super onpopular opinion. i want gw3 and start a comepletely new journey.  
---
theres nothing drawing me back to gw2 after 5k hours, i feel like i "finished" the game.  
---
gw2 was by far, the best mmorpg ive ever played, the game i played the most. i liked it so much that i stopped arguing about it because i realised im too biased. it ruined every other mmorpg for me cause nothing ever since came close to it. when it came to QoL, it ruined every other games QoL for me because i got used to the best.  
---
i just.. wanted to have said that
---
People really are stupid with their money...
---
Thank you , finally someone said it. 
---
dunno,why you are trying to make this tragic event,loss is part of life,just move forward and stop with fake tears,they not dying,they gona be back on wheels within month.
---
Like *gw2 has no endgame*.
---
Anyone heard if Joe Kimmes was fired?
---
Please take your time with this.
---
Attempting to put out a high quality product as GW2 in the current situation and state of mind could only make matters worse.
---
This is a **huge** blow to the company. This is going through the office, counting to 4 and everyone with a 2 has to leave.
---
Please find your feet and let the dust settle. Only then can we get this back on the rails to a brighter future.
---
"We'll get through this" 
---
--- Mike O'Brien
---
Yeah, they almost never go back to fix things, they're always releasing new stuff instead of improving the systems we already have.
---
ESO has definitely overtaken it now, so not quite.
---
Soon the offices will be closed permanently.
---
I'd say it depends. I've worked in a software development company and when the financial problems occurred, many skilled and experienced people decided to leave. Some of them were people who had been considering changing the job for some time and the problems simply allowed them to make their minds. 
---
I can only speak from my experience, but in my country IT specialists, especially programmers, often change their jobs because they're tired of working on a certain project. That's not something exceptional.
---
As for severance packages, I'm not sure how much money can you get, but I'd be really surprised that people who believed they are not going to be laid off decided to go for it. 
---
Fractals &gt; raids 
---
You wouldn't happen to have a link to the original comic, would you?
---
You've no idea how correct you are
---
Wow the entitlement in this comment section is staggering.
---
Has it ever occurred to anyone that people may want to support the game because they want to wake up the next day and be able to go to Tyria as they always have, and have their characters all still there available to greet them?
---
Did anyone ever stop to think, maybe you're taking a break from the game but you would still like to be able to come back and return to it again in the future?
---
But NO. That's not how gamers work these days. We've put so much time and energy into our suggestions and criticisms that we take EVERY OPPORTUNITY (even the horrible ones like now) to push those agendas.
---
You're not investing in stocks here. 
---
Maybe a general roadmap, but development is tricky and full of unknowns at all times (one of the reasons it's so expensive). 
---
If you publish a roadmap with dates, then people expect you to get those dates, even if bugs/unknowns/etc cause the development to slow and then the only choices are to put out and unfinished and overly buggy release (every release of software is buggy btw) or delay it.... Both of which harm perceptions.
---
The two ways I've seen this problem addresses is by:
---
1. Setting a static release cadence and what's ready is ready and what's not gets put off till next release.... This is hard to do with gaming due to how content works.
---
2. The other way is by releasing when a feature/content is ready for general release, but that comes with no date, which again tends to not work for have company execs and customers...
---
So we end up with what we have, which usually leads to regular delays and buggy releases.
---
I do not think this has anything to do with Arenanet or GW2's performance (it's steady so far), but more that their projects did not fit NCsoft's plan going forwards.
---
I think NCsoft, like many others, are looking to go mobile, and mobile games just need less devs. They are (often) easy throwaway products and still more profitable with people unable to help themselves with their monetizations, and we are seeing the result of this here, imo. Across the industry, more and more downsizing as companies restructure for a greater share of mobile - just look at Actiblizz.
---
My thoughts exactly. I don't get paid till the 15th and I'm broke!
---
We know that we'll still get the next episode of living world and a full season after that. What we don't know is how long that season will be, if there will be any delays or issues with the scope or quality of those episodes because of the lay-offs, and about what will happen after season 5 is done.
---
I'd say that's still good until like late 2020. You should just enjoy the game until then.
---
&gt; Arenanet really seems to have problems actually utilizing their workforce, if it's as big as they say it is.
---
That's the impression I get at least. I'm wording that in cynical questions though, because I don't have insider knowledge and am a very confused person when it comes to their actual output.
---
A roadmap is certainly necessary but I wouldn't expect one for at least the next 2 weeks or 3 tbh or even months - Things like this could take time if they havent planned anything already.
---
this is really nice to hear, thank you for sharing 
---
I m sorry for the devs that lost their jobs but, I personally wont spend another euro until they announce future content like raids/ fractals /dungeons/new elite specs/WvW overhaul or something. A two-three hour story every 2-3 months is not content and I believe that most people dont even give gw2 a try because of that very casual nature of the game
---
Thank you for the positivity. 
---
This stuff happens in the corporate world. It's certainly not the end of GW2. If anything, this could be good if it shifts focus from (clearly) unproductive side projects to all focus on GW2.
---
World End event would possibly tempt me into reinstalling this game. Here's hoping.
---
&gt;	Now that we don’t know whether Expansion 3 will ever be made, or if there will be anything else post Season 5?
---
Implying we *did* know before?
---
I know, I know. But I'm incredibly salty that anet has such a thin skin and doesn't engage in conversation with the community because of a few idiots who can easily be ignored. It's so childish.
---
An "Arcanist" is a fantasy classic and could be nice :)
---
I dind´t think about the mixed nature of the greatsword. Maybe the balance is better than i though :D
---
Especially if you also factor in:
---
* Class balance happens at glacial pace.
---
* Class changes beyond balance (reworks / pruning) basically don't happen.
---
* Fractals and Raids are once in a blue moon.
---
* Everything else (guild events, guild housing zones, WvW mechanics/zone improvements, PvP, UI, QoL, customization outside of the gem store) is pretty much abandoned.
---
Where are all the hours going towards? I mean I get that people were working on other projects - and probably still will be - but often it felt like GW2 was down to a 20-30 skeleton crew.
---
To be honest all this stuff doesn't worry me because Guild Wars 2 won't continue, that's silly of course. It worries me because I see a really cool company and some great developers losing their jobs and their presence will be missed, that's all.
---
It's not the end of the world or the end of the MMO in any way shape or form but certainly a time that people can justifiably be sad about the state of this situation.
---
Not fired. Laid off.
---
Sure the end result of "no longer employed" is the same, but it's incorrect and frankly, insulting to those affected, to imply that it was somehow their fault.
---
You in a year: "Where is everyone?"
---
well we know that they had 3 teams working on living story that were roughly 10-15 people each
---
the raid/fractal team was 10 people
---
then you have to think they probably had 10-15 people working on gem store items
---
so roughly 75 people working on live content for gw2...but we can go ahead and say 100 if you want to count in the narrative, cutscene, and community guys
---
that leaves 300 people doing other projects, after the firings, thats 200 people being folded back into the gw2 team
---
She's eloquent, forceful, and has a great linguistic command. She's got **all** of the necessary core skills/affects of an excellent writer.
---
But yes, her level of open talk means it's likely she's landed somewhere with a very clear agreement she's not to in any way be seen to represent the business publicly, and potentially may be barred from saying where she works as a result.
---
As with a lot of people, I do respect her abilities, but not her attitude or insistence on certain kinds/spins on delivery.

This is very, very important for the community to hear right now.  Please get some visibility to this post. 
---
I just hope Anet can get free of NCSoft and work either independently or with a company that won't fuck them up the ass like this. 
---
na ... same guy who does build templets 
---
Dailies are guaranteed 2g.
---
Daily Tequatl is 1g from the kill and often another after you put the rares from the loot up on TP.
---
AB meta like you mentioned is good reward for time invested, as is TD meta.
---
Time-gated mats.  Bolts of Silk, Thick Leather Squares, Mithril Ingots, and Elder Wood Planks all condense into materials that can only be crafted once a day.  Combined with other materials you'll farm over time, they can turn into good gold profit.
---
Lastly, I'm a fan of the Lake Doric leather farm when there's a run going.  2-3 hours of tagging centaurs with a group of about 30 people converts into ~20g on average for me.
---
It was new to him!
---
That'd be great but I think it's unlikely. Best bet is ANet devs leave and start a new indie company. But we obviously wouldn't get another GW if that happened.
---
I think you may be in the wrong sub.
---
Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.
---
Is using macros for the mystic toilet banable? 
---
Do you really even want an expansion that the creators didn't want and were forced to develop against their will and desire?
---
Jason VandenBerghe was let go from ArenaNet as well. Rumor has it his misdirection is what led to the mass layoffs. 
---
I think you lost the comparison
---
Summed up well by deroir, might teapot and others yesterday on their upload on YouTube:
---
"(anet already has the best mmorpg on the market) we just want anet to have the same faith in gw2 that we - the players, do. "
---
I give your troll attempt a -1/10. You lost a point for being on the wrong board to begin with.
---
/u/ArchdesignerZmodd if you could copy/paste this link here to your original post as it's a better link for everyone. 
---
There are options between two extremes.
---
Yes, it's the only thing that could save the reputation of the game and the company right now. 
---
If we don't get one during March, I don't think the game will ever recover. It's been many years and years of disappointment, the layoffs broke the camel's back for good.
---
Thanks, have been keeping my eyes open for it for the past weeks and today was the first day in those weeks that I didn't watch. :)
---
I think your shitposting skills are too weak to convey a point :V
---
Not at all. If you're implying GW2 has no road map, look at the time investment and horizons of a Living World season.
---
We have at minimum 2 years of *planned* content. That doesn't mean it will get executed on, but no announcement =\= no roadmap.
---
Scarlet destroying the maps was just... Insanely cool. The tower was amazing. I managed to solo my way to the top (obviously map wasn’t empty but I wasn’t I a party) and I was so proud of myself given I’m a casual. The limited time LA map changes really got me playing way more than usual because I wanted to earn the rewards. I still have some family heirlooms and have no idea if I can trade them in, but I won’t destroy them if not because I like to RP in my head a little and my characters would be too sad o let go of them. 
---
HoT was why I stopped playing very often to be honest. Hard to explore alone initially, too many crap items filling my inventory, too many things I needed to save for recipes. The maps building up to the expansion were so fun especially with all the collections to complete.
---
I felt like season 4 threw way too many new maps at you. Why not gradually unveil a large one like with season 3? Also the plot was just all over the place. Too many different threads and I never felt like I was working towards anything excited, unlike season 3. I especially hate that I have to redo a heart to access the shop that day. You can’t even preview it so you have to swap out to the wiki to decide if it’s worth it. I don’t have time to keep doing them and it gets super boring. 
---
PoF was ok I guess. The maps feel a bit empty in a way. 
---
I had my son shortly after PoF came out so I’ve not had enough time to play. I’ve not even unlocked all of season 5 so I’ll have to pay for the first time. I did start episode 1 but it took too long and I had to leave part way through the first instance as my son woke up. I have a daughter now too so I have no chance of playing it. 
---
Anyhoo, season 3 was the best new content imho. They need to go back to that. 
---
Their focus never shifted away at all, a tiny percentage of the staff were working on other projects and I sincerely doubt the amount of money was nearly as vast as you claim, also within the game industry it is incredibly common to have games never come to fruition despite years being worked on, sometimes even being close to finished but other factors get it cancelled.
---
We don't really know the situation properly other than very basic facts so it's quite silly to attach the full blame to either company frankly.
---
Keep the panic up and hate pleb
---
&gt;there
---
Cool graph. You're ignoring a lot of things.
---
The cumulative revenue of aion is much higher than that of gw2. In its first 3 years aion had more sales than gw2 in its entire lifespan.
---
Cumulative revenue matters. Mmorpgs are large investments which are paid off over years after their launch.
---
Gw2 is a western mmo, developed predominantly in the USA by a large team of hundreds of devs. Aion devs in SK are most likely cheaper by quite a margin. What about the size of the team behind it? I wouldn't be surprised if it's both cheaper and smaller.
---
Hundreds of millions of less total revenue and likely higher development costs due to a large entirely western studio. I wonder what the profit margins look like.
---
The YEARLY revenue of NCSofts worst end of life eastern mmo is slightly below that of a younger gw2? That's such a relief!
---
Glad it helped :)
---
If you are looking for cool mounts, but dead maps, desiged for singleplayer experience, go for PoF
---
If you are looking for lame gliders, but maps that are the populates in the whole game with awesome meta events with big loot, then you should go for HoT
---
I concur. I don’t think gw2 is dying, but all this news does have a lot of players on edge. A road map that lays out what they’re working on and what we can expect would really quell  some of the flames. As another person said, I don’t see that happening in the immediate future though. They need some amount of time to let the dust settle. 
---
However, I would be surprised is we don’t get some sort of blog from MO relatively soon. 
---
Fully fleshed out expansions with living world and festivals in between. And if one had to be prioritized I would want it to be expansions. 
---
Oh nice Detail they added there.  Ty
---
I want to see them better integrated sPVP, WvW &amp; PvE into a community with shared goals and involvement in the game.
---
From the title, the first sentence to the last you are dictating people to dont dare to have another opinion then your own, how can i respect that. Furteron there is a list of everyone gone at this time, most are developers, and yes that is a fact.
---
How about 2 water 2 air 2 fire 2 earth weapons? More skills is good
---
I think gw2’s world feel alive which is really cool. I wanna see more “living world” and I don’t mean the stories.
---
I hope the things I love about archeage can be translated into gw2.
---
A dolyak mount, which moves slow but helps you carry trading packs from town to town and complete trading quests. Then bandits or bosses can spawn to fk you up, so it can be a group quest too.
---
I know they are eventually going to do fishing. They didn’t add fish ingredients in the game for this sole purpose. Fishing please!
---
No, none of it is real.  One day we'll all wake up and find that we're really just skritt running around a maze built to amuse the Elder Dragons as we scramble around looking for cheese and shinies.
---
I hope those who lost their jobs find other work quickly, it must be awful to find out at such short notice.
---
As for the game, and genre generally, well i don't personally understand the popularity of mobile games with their constant loot boxes etc...but i guess that is because of my age (i grew up with muds!).
---
I want a vast world and story arch to explore such as in an MMO, but conversely now that i have a job/partner etc i cant put in huge numbers of hours, or commit to a 'raiding schedule' 
---
I think for an mmo, targeting their demographic must be difficult. But from my brief experience of GW2 they got a lot right, and certainly have a good and friendly community.
---
Lets hope things pick up, i suspect GW2 has had people come over from wow recently due to BFA being poorly received.
---
It doesn't really. One raid wing a year isn't a sustainable endgame. Pvp/wvw would be endgame content but they are basically unsupported as well. At this point guild wars 2 is just living story.
---
I am painfully aware of that. Heres to that we just hit rock bottom and it will all be better from now on for everyone involved.
---
We might not have heard a word, but many of us surely felt like it was being neglected.
---
Now let's see if they can take it back where it belongs, that's the real question.
---
Rough transcript for people that can't watch the video right now:

&gt;My feeling is that gw2 is going to do well, it's going to do great, it has key people that are still there, as far as I know, that really drove the vision of the game and the quality and the focus on guild wars 2, because we werent really focused as a studio, [...] the focus that is going to come out of this will be good as guild wars 2 as a game
---
This is really sad
---
The new "This Is Fine"
---
But don’t quit trolling the subreddit and talking about how you are are second class citizen. Why would anybody ever want to be a developer on a game? It’s such a thankless task. Thankless in the paycheck, thankless in the hours, but mostly thankless in the community. I feel horrible for the people that got laid off, but hopefully they can break the cycle of abuse and work a job with quadruple the pay and half the hours. 
---
Lol, just stop playing the game if you don't even enjoy it. Also, you what, just ignore all the achievements and collections that come with each episode? That's not "content" for you?
---
&gt; The YEARLY revenue of NCSofts worst end of life eastern mmo is slightly below that of a younger gw2? That's such a relief!
---
2015 Aion was 6 years old. 2015 yearly revenue was 74bn KRW. 2018 Guild Wars 2 was 6 years old and posted a revenue of 80bn KRW. 
---
Yes, Aion earned a hell of a lot more than Guild Wars 2 over its lifetime, but it also fell off of a cliff, compared to Guild Wars 2. Aion sells about 25% of what it sold during its release years and while , yes, Guild Wars 2 alos sells significantly less than it did in 2012, it has been running stable at around 80bn KRW for 5 years, which is still about 50% of what it sold during its launch year.
---
The grapoh wasn't supposed to sell the idea that Guild Wars 2 is the more profitable game over all, but it was supposed to show that it is doing extremely fine financially, compared to some of its direct competitors.
---
There's an opening for cautious optimism here. Look at it this way; if there *is not* a timeline given, business is continuing as usual, and that's weirdly encouraging. A Living World season implies (but does not guarantee) roughly 20 months of continued development and growth in the game.
---
If there *is* a timeline given, that's *such a huge improvement* that only good things can be happening. Anything more than just a season statement suggests (but does not guarantee) that deeper-than-LS-episodes levels of content are still possible with the refactored company structure.
---
I really wonder how long there's been little focus on GW2. I love this game, but the lack of content just made me slowly stop playing.
---
I hope this is a wake-up call for those that remain at ArenaNet.
---
If they could come up with enough fun and unique feeling skills, ok :D
---
&gt; hopefully wvw will be okay(ish?)
---
Only if the mount is canceled.
---
That is not what I meant. I am telling you that GW2, right now, can still pull it back together from the layoffs and we, as the players, should still have our hopes up. 
---
It would be helpful if someone summarized it for those that can't watch the video / listen to the audio right now.  Not that someone *has* to do that, but it would help - only seeing a bunch of responses that this is great makes me anxious to see what was said lol
---
I think a communications team that didn't fabricate certain things would benefit the long term goal of a roadmap. 
---
Got a source for that Mr Time Traveler?
---
Yup all good. 
---
It's just the same as buying battlefield or any other big game.
---
Agreed. Pof was meh at best mounts or no mounts. HoT was just a lot more innovative. 
---
“ 2 hours of story content that isn't fun to replay. ”
---
Burn this meme to the ground. If you played sandswept isles for only two hours, excluding story, thats your own personal preferences and not some damning reflection on the content made. 
---
Could they be more efficient and provide more replayability with updates? Sure, but the 2 hours meme is pure exaggerrated horse shit.
---
One final expansion to focus on the final Dragon, the final Living Story season to tie loose ends, the final episode to tie into GW3.
---
So.....yes, GW3 because GW2, even without the layoffs, GW2's main lore is reaching the end \[the main focus are the 6 dragons: 2 are dead, 2 are hibernating after nearly dying so they're out for centuries according to the lore, 1 will be killed soon since Caithe being Branded was done for the sole reason of having her defeat Kralkatorrik and the final one is an unknown\].  
---
I really do hope they're thinking of ideas by now for GW3 rather than desperately try to stretch out the final Dragon or retcon their own lore by saying Jormag and Primordus will suddenly rise.
---
This guy rhethorics. An argument from authority isn't necessarily a logical fallacy, and in this case it isn't. 
---
I have played GW2 on and off since the beginning and had turned to it as my main game when WoW's expansion was so terrible. Now hearing of all these layoffs and uncertainty, and seeing how many important people are now gone, I am left wondering if my time is better spent in a game like ESO which I at least know has an expansion coming out soon. The whole MMO scene seems to be crumbling and I don't know what to do.
---
I like both and I really like CM fractals but still, in my opinion, there are far more good encounters in raids than there are in fractals.
---
Its unfortunate but thats how industry is. Skilled devs will find new jobs and years of experience in arenanet counts too. But it will be uncomfortable and difficult.
---
Would it make you feel better if I said 10 hours instead?
---
&gt; some kind of ANet cult rather than a community for the GW2 game.
---
Hit the nail on the head. People act as if their *friends just died*.
---
So what about the future of Arena Net? What happens AFTER GW2? If they're going all in on GW2 and have absolutely nothing cooking in background Arena Net has no future once GW2 inevitably ends.
---
We might get some talk eventually when the dust settles down, I must admit I had lost all hope but now I'm actually excited for the future of the game. Still sad for the people who lost their jobs though...
---
So what lead to the shut down. Nobody shuts down a money maker. What was the real reason behind it
---
he mains chronomancer i heard
---
First they track you till end of days while you play and spy on your running applications, then they mine crypto with your GPU, then they don't know what they are working on, then they fire all their hard workers.. Guild Wars is gonna die. It's toast. Gaming in general is toast. The next generation of idiots will only game on consoles and phones and developers know that, that's why they are all in disarray about their projects and staffing and keeping pushing dumb shit average gen x and older millennial gamers don't want. IF you want a great MMORPG you'll have to gather your resources, knowledge, and skills and start it yourself, because the large developers of today only care about increasing profits, not delivering material you and the hardworking individuals who are (or were) dedicated to creating, want to see and play.
---
Stop.
---
We need more community managers here like Bex at /r/pathofexile who actually communicate with players and dev teams, and not do shitty pr talk w/o any actual onformation.
---
How about we stop telling grown people what to do and not do, and let them decide for themselves what they wanna spend their time and money on.
---
Yeah and Josh Foreman, it's not like he's responsible for some of the most Dan favorite content in the game or anything
---
Basically he says Anet were unfocused as it had several projects on the go, that were pulling focus away from GW2. That the people left were key people who were important to the development and quality of GW2 itself and that this will actually refocus them back to GW2 and make GW2 better in the long run. 
---
Hope that helps 
---
To be fair, i've seen Ben much-much more often than Paul
---
Man, I am gonna miss him. One of the things I love (and hate) to do most in GW2 is jumping puzzles ... such a sad day.
---
Since HoT I bet.
---
Do you have any idea of how many of those people have come and gone over the years. We've lost key people before, in a short period of time. In case you haven't noticed, Amazon was hiring a bunch of them, left and right, including the game director. I'm really not sure you've been paying attention, because I have. Losing a writer or two from a staff of writers doesn't kill the game. Losing Colin didn't kill the game either. Anyone who's paying attention knows we lost Jeff Grub and Ree Sosbee for example...but the game keeps going. Legendary armor is actually done and they weren't making more legendary armor.  There are as many people working at Anet now as there was when the game launched. One of us needs to do some research. Pretty sure it's not me.
---
It appears you have a little bias towards a certain color scheme.
---
For me its blue/white ice/frozen aesthetics. 
---
Yeah I ignore them because I can't bring myself to do the same story more than once, it's boring and not challenging at all. I don't need the achie points so I don't see why I'd do them. Every skin worth having comes from the store anyways which I could just buy.
---
I enjoy the game, more or less, but I only care about instanced group content, PvP, and to some extent WvW. This is by no means a very narrow scope, I'm talking about what, 80% of the game? But unfortunately discardable, forgettable LS updates soak up seemingly 70% of the resources and then gemstore another 20%, at least. 80% of the game gets 10% of the resources and I'm probably being generous.
---
You have been on a power trip for far too long, /u/neok182. ArenaNet should seriously consider contacting reddit in order to get you replaced.
---
Try and wait for a sale, you can get it for half the price. Should be in March.
---
Gw2 needs a successor project at some point. It wont last forever. Im very worried that even if this is better for gw2’s next year, it guts anet’s future.
---
I mostly worked this off of what happened the last time we got an influx of fresh blood to WvW, which was the update that brought us the Warbringer backpack, though with an emphasis of ease of access and not outright min-maxing your WvW damage/heal/mitigation.
---
I suggested herald use Rage runes only because of how sporadic incoming heals and mitigation buffs tend to be in an even more disorganized group of mostly new/inexperienced players (of which Fury is a strong offensive buff for the Herald, especially when using Invocation variants of their many WvW builds), it tends to be a bit more of a safer damage option for learning the mode. You're also not sleeping on Facet of Darkness for the uptime damage boost, its because you can quickly consume it for the stun break.
---
I also never said to strictly use Tempest, I suggested it as its one of the more safer Ele specs to learn the mode on because of their heals. If you wanted to min-max or are good at the class enough in PvE to be ableto keep yourself alive in a FPS dropping clusterfuck of skills and character models Weaver does more for damage and defense, but regardless Meteor Shower on either ele spec helps with destroying enemy siege out of range of Necro shades, guardian symbols, etc because of the large hit box and how the projectiles fall from above.
---
I love it. It's like we are the boss and not actually customers.
---
Why won't this MMO get a third expansion? that's a bit of an ovverreaction.
---
Done!
---
or do stop... this isn't exactly a strong display of trust.
---
They can get more money once they show they know what the hell they are doing
---
It was confirmed on a personal stream from a dev that gw2 wasn't really the main goal anymore so here's hoping to change! 
---
Interesting thought as well...Don´t add new skill types but alter the old ones.
---
I have been playing ESO on and off ever since it went buy to play and I still have tons of DLC to get through even though I bought it all.   For me its a great MMO to hop in and out of just like GW2.
---
Whats crazy to me is that ESO puts out about 4 DLC packs a year plus an expansion (for the past 2 years).  The DLC is about equal to living story that GW2 does.  I hate to say it but maybe anet should have monetized the living story seasons instead of completely free (if you login in time).  As much as that sucks for the players maybe that would have helped keep a higher employee count.
---
One of the most communicative devs there was. Fixed issues ASAP.. Listened to the community. Fucking actually worked on the game and made great improvements.. This one hurts the most. 
---
Not a single thing you said is relevant for finance or shareholders. 
---
Its relevant for players and yet players aren't putting their money where their mouth is. At least not sufficiently. Or perhaps gw2 simply didnt retain enough players. 
---
&gt;The focus that's gonna come out of this will be good for Guild Wars 2, as a game. I'm fairly confident about that. Whether this is for the studio and longterm future, that I'm not so sure.
---
That's pretty much Josh's views right there, and they sound right. Anet was trying to be more than a single IP company with good reason, but stretched too thin and now they're stuck with just 1 game to support as their lifeline - in the short term, at least.
---
Focus shifted away. Patched got delayed. Content became lack luster. Content got ignored. Etc. This all probably resulted in lower then expected revenue.
---
The problems that led us here haven't been addressed though. That's what should be worrying us right now, GW2 needs focus, but it needs direction as well, so that these mistakes don't repeat again.
---
I think HoT had problems for multiple reasons, but not resources.
---
However, PoF was a mess at release, severely lacking in multiple aspects. I think that's when the downhill began.
---
Would you guys say the odds of GW3 have gone down with the recent layoffs?
---
Not a power trip when users are saying developers deserve to die for their work on a game and threatening others with death if they were not fired. 
---
The mod team as a whole was actually thanked for our efforts yesterday by a few past and current devs so I think they are okay with what we are doing. An incredibly small number of people were banned and the post did its job to make people think twice about posting hateful or threatening messages. 
---
Why can't you proceed? Most masteries are helpful but not mandatory (and the appropriate episode will unlock them if they are)
---
Fuck no... 
---
I dont mean youre a heartless prick. I mean that your language probably is part of why some comments were like that.
---
Also, even in a business sense we dont know if they were dead weight. 
---
I would like to say this, there has never been a better time to play GW2, specially if you are new to the game or returning player, there is plenty to do and if you ever see veterans say otherwise its most likely cause they devoured everything the game has to offer.
---
Not an expert but I think just looking at the TP statistics is a good way to get an idea about how healthy the population is, not to mention that everywhere you go and no matter how obscure the event is on any map you will have people there helping along.
---
Worst thing you can do is panic and leave or not consider the game all together, just because people got laid off from what it may seem very important positions doesn't mean things will remain the same, the entire studio will get reshuffled to make things balanced and as fucked up as it may sound, this whole situation may actually make the game better.  
---
&gt; Sucks for the devs who got fired, but they were apparently mostly talented guys from a top tier studio. They will manage.
---
So can we stop acting like somebody just died, please. If they really were your "friends", you'll stay in contact. If they were not, nothing to worry about besides the usual "life sucks sometimes". And if you thought they were, but they really were not, it's time to think about your pseudosocial relationships.
---
This sub is overreacting so hard right now. For gods sake, we can admit that it must be bad without crying uncontrollably. Some people...
---
Under the macro policy yes, it could be. Depends on how lenient ANet wants to be but as the Mystic Toilet could be considered as a "farm" it might fall under automated farming.
---
Telling us if they working on a next expansion, will help ease the situation... unless they don't.
---
Well, now is not the right moment to cook anything. They'll have to wait a year or two before trying new stuff.
---
The only goal now is strengthening GW2 as much as possible so they have a steady source of income to recover and try again. If I was them, I would move straight to GW3, recycling many of GW2's assets instead of making a 100% new game.
---
I'm a WildStar refugee, and this feels similar to that kicked off the slow death spiral that game went into. 
---
GW2 is definitely a more polished game, and has more players on a bad day than i ever remember even during prime time on WS, so I hope that means Im wrong.
---
It still gives me anxiety though...  I'm not sure I want to go through that all over again.  It wasn't just a game it was a community.
---
I'm still gonna play and spend the occasional $$, but I'm going to do a lot less impulse buying.  I spent 100's on mounts and housing plot items in WS that I'll never see again.
---
is now here- [&amp;BBkAAAA=]
---
I meant since launch, not during the making of. Sorry.
---
Dont let reddit get you down. For one thing you are already getting your moneys worth out of both expansions. Also, anet still has at the very least 250 employees, thats a lot of people to develop further content. Ofc its sad to see all those people leave, especially those that we know from podcasts and livestreams and have been with the company for roughly a decade, but its not the end. And if Im seeing this correctly, no area has been totally abandoned by anet. Meaning the teamsizes of all teams working on gw2 have been reduced, but they havent been disbanded. Thats something to keep in mind.
---
The worst that can happen, is that after season 5 we wont see much further developement. But for one thing I doubt that, and for another... thats over a year of content still getting out and that you'll get on top of your expansions content. Thats over a year for anet to develop new stuff.
---
People get fired all the time, how do you even manage to live in the real world if you're constantly crying?
---
That whole knowing the rotation and needing to optimize when deviating because of mechanics is exactly the same in WoW. In fact it is pretty much 90% of the difference between a low parse and high parse. 
---
There were numerous indications of this being the case, 2 being longer breaks between LS releases and going from one LS season directly to the next.
---
To be fair, nobody really knows, it depends on specifics. And josh himself hinted that anet may now be pigeonholed into gw2 with nothing to succeed it.
---
&gt;I dont mean youre a heartless prick. I mean that your language probably is part of why some comments were like that.
---
Likely so. My intention and what people interpret are likely different. But if its true that these sides projects were cancelled then it makes sense to lay people off. Again, as sucky as that may be. 
---
Yeah, it won't make sense for a lot of specs, but some are very open to it.
---
Otherwise eventually we'd end up with all classes having all utility types, and I think that's bad. Treating conjures as kits through an elite makes sense to me more than, say, changing Glyphs into Traps or something similar.
---
It all seems to be linked to the unannounced and cancelled projects we were discretely told about, so now that all the focus is going back to their existing property, we can only hope the 300 employees still working on the game will make it work.
---
Too soon to tell what will happen, but i guess we will find out eventually.
---
Preserving the community by telling people to stop playing? Ah, this will surely lead to a brighter future for Guild Wars 2. 
---
Newsflash, one of the biggest issues is that people ARE leaving the game. 
---
Holy hell.. Please keep quiet child. 
---
Yep! Left for FFXIV a few years ago.
---
He actually volunteered to leave, unfortunately. I doubt they actually would have wanted him out because he was actually on the team working on GW2 and not some other projects, as far as we know. 
---
GW2 is an incredible game, extremely accessible, and totally worth your time.
---
I would really, really, /really/, love a roadmap at the start of Season 5.
---
They have said time and again that they cannot reasonably provide such a schedule because it will translate as "promises" to players, and they will face anger when treading back on their decisions - but this particular decision has proven to stir a similar amount of unrest. 
---
People right now want to know what the game is facing in the future. There will be some major restructuring happening in the studio in weeks to come, but when the dust has settled, I really would appreciate some insights into where they want to take this game, what they think about future expansions, etc. 
---
A tumor maybe
---
It blows my mind that Lineage is doing better than all of them...
---
Haha, I know right? I always like, hmmm, let put something red somewhere in this look.
---
&gt;A lot of us are now faced with the question of how much effort and resources to invest in a game we love when so many big names of endgame content will be gone.
---
Just paraphrasing.
---
This probably all happened because of chasing $$$ and trends, directed from upper management or above.
---
Obviously they were working on a mobile game of some kind - that's where the real money is these days unfortunately. Who knows how many people were diverted to that.
---
Do wonder what the other project could've been, I pray it wasn't a battle royale/hero shooter/other trend chasing game.
---
Hopeful that this does indeed refocus the entire studio on what they should've been focused on the entire time: GW2. Develop more expansions/LW seasons, more raids/fractals etc and just general faster content releases. No need to chase a cash cow when you could already have one. 
---
Even work on/fix areas of the game that have been neglected, even old "dead" content like dungeons. 
---
Wvw maybe! I know we're getting alliances &amp; the mount, but a full time dedicated team would be amazing. Doesn't even have to be huge, just a small team with the sole focus on WvW. WvW is a USP for this game and it's been neglected for so long. Ideally they'd be from each aspect of WvW though - gvg'ers, blobbers, roamers, ppt'ers etc.
---
Same goes for PvP, raids, fractals etc. I get that open world PvE is where most focus needs to go, but give the other aspects of the game their own full teams too.
---
I do hope they utilise the entire studio of undoubtedly very talented people for every aspect of the game moving forward. 
---
Advertisement/marketing too! The game needs better advertisement.
---
Most of us want to keep good references from our former employees, it helps when looking for a new job.
---
&gt;i cant help thinking the golden age of MMO is well and truly over. 
---
No, whats currently happening, is that the gaming market - including mmos - got overhyped for years and now is leveling out. This is something that happens now and then and usually smaller studios that just scrap by weather it better than bigger studios, that have more to loose.
---
We have NCSofts promise to keep the servers at least running, and anets promise to go ahead with living story until at least end of season5. Any further promises currently would sound false anyway. But thats over a year of new content you are still getting, on top of the basegame + 2 expansions.
---
Also, something to consider... gw2 is a game perfectly tailored towards casual gaming. Theres no gear treadmill, no hard work you have to put into it, like with other mmos. Id say, go for it. You are getting your money's worth, no worries there. If you liked the base game, the expansions are even better :)
---
&gt;use the same old talking points when talking about
---
So like the horrible performance ?.... i mean legit point and it gets kinda worse.
---
&gt;most groups won't accept disgusting exotic filth
---
There is literally not a single GW2 raider in existence who is actually worth their salt that will tell you not to raid in exotics.
---
Sure, ascended is better. By 5%. But if your numbers are bad enough to be a problem without the extra 5%, I guarantee your numbers will still be unacceptable even with full ascended, infusions, and writs. I haven't seen a raid commander unironically ask for gear pings in... I don't even know how long. Nobody cares if you run exotics. They care if you can pull your weight or not, which genuinely good raiders could still do in yellows.
---
Run a proper build, hit the golem once in a while, show up without an ego, and you'll do just fine.
---
BUILD TEMPLATES
---
Nope, I agree with you 100% They have been slowly killing the game for me with less and less substantial content. I would play as what you call a Hardcore Casual. I don't do raids, don't spend a lot of time in fractals, but I did spend just about every waking moment I wasn't at work in the game. PvE and WvW. Then the LS updates got slower and smaller. That reduced me to logging on once every 4 months for no more than in reality maybe 6 hours. Some cool gem shop stuff, but I didnt buy it anymore because as cool as it may have looked, I had no long term plans to be in the game and actually want things like that. Then Slower and even less contant with the promise of no expansion for at least the next year. Uggh. I hope this results in an expansion after LS5. The out look for someone like me is honestly still pretty bleak until they start putting some substance back into the game. I have over 12k hours in the game, so I have pretty much been there and done that with any Ideas you can throw at the table. New content is really the only hope. Expansions. 
---
Yeah if thats the roadmap there might as well not be one
---
Not saying the combat is comparable at all but FFXIV has different raid difficulties. Normal mode so the entire community can get clears and savage mode for those wanting to push it (Savage is equivalent to the default gw2 difficulty)
---
And where does it say "Give me what I want or I'll leave?". 
---
Honestly your paraphrasing even helps me debunk your statement by clearly saying "faced with the question of how much effort and resources to invest". It only talks about the amount of resources invested by degree - not an ultimatum. 
---
I can see Krak wipeing the server off the face of the universe for sure
---
This information has been all over glassdoor for years, as well as some past-devs talking (however vaguely) about the ills of the management in ArenaNet. They have a lot of super talented employees who end up having to take the blame for how management pushed them into shit directions without listening to the people who actually understand what gamers care about.
---
I mean, do you really think not a single Dev at the time of season 1, where they thought it would be a bright idea to produce content at bi-weekly that would just disappear after, stood up and said "hey this sounds unsustainable for both players and developers". 
---
&gt; like I’m seeing people post.
---
Thing is subreddit is a minority of the player-base (hell big part of them are ex-vets who left at various dates and just visit for updates  and/or salt).
---
This might be hard to find valid information through all the "spam" but one thing i could recommend is start free-2-play account and just level to 80, gear up and do some of available content, by the time you get there, you will notice if things changed to worse, of it is worth to spend on expacs.
---
I doubt the cancelations had anything to do with gw2s state. They don't care about quality, just revenue and the revenue was normal. The projects were likely canceled for reasons specific to those projects.
---
daedgaem
---
Ignore those drama queens, yes it's worth playing. 
---
&gt; if you love dodging and dashing in GW2 you will probably hate FFXIV's combat
---
Ah what I feared is what you write. Rip.
---
NEW MOUNT AND BALANCE PATCH NEXT WEEK! YEEEEY
---
Care to link it?, I don't think i've ever seen this.
---
What does ls5 tell us? Nothing apart from boring open world pve...
---
We didn't, but we had less reason to suspect it wasn't happening. PoF came around pretty suddenly in 2017. Two years after HoT. We're less than a year away from what could've been expansion 3, but we knew it was delayed because they've slotted in another season of living world. That was ominous in itself, but losing 25% of the developers with vague implications that some of them were working on side projects that weren't going anywhere, is a lot to shoulder.
---
Sure why not? Because studio was cut down to the numbers back around gw2 release that means no new content?
---
This is it boys!
---
2019 started with a heavy kick in the butt, but it will propel anet to the moon!
---
* 4 new raid wings
---
* wvw alliances that will bring all the casual pve players in
---
* amazing balance patches
---
* 6 new fractals
---
* an amazing legendary greatsword somehow even more epic than Eternity
---
* a top tier espansion quality living world season 5
---
* cantha expansion announcement.
---
LETS GO!
---
All black lion key farmers :P
---
Nope. Ncsoft hated that area
---
It's always the south. 
---
I like the game too, and I also think there are plenty of things I'd like to see improve. But I definitely haven't suffered through years and years of disappointment. There are thousands of other games that I'd go play instead if that were the case. Just blows my mind that people who are experiencing this constant disappointment still make this their main game where they sink all their time.
---
See, here is the thing, they haven't been supporting us. The players. Not the people, let me set that straight, the company, Anet, they expect us to shell out bucks in the gems shop while providing no real value. From the perspective of a player with over 12k hours of play. I see cool things in the gem shop I want, but I have no long term plans to play the game as it is. I log in for 4-6 hours every 4 months. They publicly told us no expansion for literally the next year. Just more LS 5. Which is about 4-6 hours of content every 4months or so? It's not much to go on honestly. At this point in the games life there lack of an expansion being announced does herald the games death. Its the devs telling us, we aren't really doing to add much to this game anymore. If this results in an expansion great, it doesn't change the black fact that at least for about the next year, we don't have much coming in the way of actual substance and real content. Is it too late to save the game? No, probably not, but they need a clear roadmap within the next 30 days showing they are committed to more than small bits of content every 4 months. That isn't how you keep the game alive long term. They need steady players actively engaged and playing with plans to continue playing to support the gem shop. They need to up their gem shop game too because the quality of the outfits and such leaves a whole lot to be desired.

Cele D/D roaming build is still pretty strong. Staff backline provides less support than Revenants, but while played well can deal the same or higher damage, and have reliable access to strong AoE CCs. Of course it's better with Weaver specialization, just due to sheer power of %damage increases and Twist of Fate, but saying that it's "very bad" is overreacting.
---
Gaile used to do some of that before they switched rules around then now she's let go it's horrible. Their social media people aren't good either
---
Time to flee from the sinking ship. It's been a pleasure. O7
---
I convinced two of my best friends to buy the complete game (including the LW episodes) literally the day before all of this started.
---
They've never played an MMO and I'm having as much fun with the game as I ever have and I'm a 10k+ hour veteran of the franchise.
---
No I add them to see achievement points and they usually have the minimum.
---
You're a glass half-full kind of thinker, which can be good at times, but I think you're making a mistake with this post. Cutting 25% of your employees at once, including some notable veterans who have had considerable experience in notable areas of the game (raids, fractals, etc.), cannot be a good idea. 
---
Content was already going at an unpredictable pace, and with these layoffs, it's quite fair for people to consider the worst possibilities. GW2 had an amazing few quarters after PoFs release (record numbers I might add). For NCSoft to lay off 100 people after that, and for you to tell people not to worry/panic is adding insult to injury. 
---
It is extremely unlikely for content to be released at a faster pace than before with such large layoffs at once. Hence the idea that GW2 could slowly die out.
---
This is a very naive look at it.  City of Heroes(NCSoft).  It was making money.  They cancelled it.  Wildstar(NCSoft) was free to play and making money despite almost no resources put into it.  They cancelled it.
---
Or let's look at a studio like HIRez.  Was making money with Global Agenda.  They abandoned it to make Tribes.  Then they abandoned that as their only money maker to make SMITE.
---
Developers and publishers frequently squash and kill games when they dont feel they make enough to warrant the investment.  They just cut 25% of ArenaNets workforce.  Clearly they dont think the profit they bring in warrants that much investment anymore.
---
It is never a good sign to downsize unless it comes with a clear new direction that the restructuring was built around.  Right now the only thing we know is that they supposedly up and cancelled two projects and mass fired a hundred people.  That is NOT a sign of confidence in the studio.
---
It was a rhethorical question to indicate that raids are by far more demanding than dungeons/fractals.
---
The way I see it on reddit is that people are just karma farming. 
---
Could also be free accounts
---
Fine. You win. Good day.
---
....you literally explain why it would be a bad idea, because THEY LEFT OR WERE FIRED.
---
You replay because you wanted to stroke your ego and failed, badly.
---
It isn't the *only* thing that will kill it. NCsoft has proven that they'll shut down games with little to no notice. City of Heroes got dicked this way, apparently. They were trumpeting a new expansion coming soon, only to get shuttered shortly after NCsoft purchased ANet.
---
I have to ask myself a question: how much do I want to invest in a game with a future *that* uncertain?
---
The answer is: not much. I'm not going to be spending much, if *any*, until they give me a real plan for the future. And then they need to *deliver* on what they say.
---
I might drop a few bucks on the game. But I don't trust NCsoft. There are other games I enjoy that have brighter futures and aren't backed by scummy companies like NCsoft - or are at least marginally less scummy.
---
I feel like I got to know him pretty well toward the end of the current events, leading up to his consumption. Plus you can go hang out at arkjok and listen to him bother his followers via statue. He has a lot of interesting lines there.
---
Because firing != laying off, and laying off != taking a severance package during cuts. Maybe a lot of the vets are taking bullets for younger developers, maybe they really were laid off, we *don't know all the details.* Heck, we don't even know if some of these people were still on GW2 at the time of their leaving.
---
It's not that it would be cancelled, but rather, slowly die due to slower content updates. That's a very reasonable assumption given the large number of employees let go.
---
Meh, that game was garbage to the core. Leave it in its grave, please. So much excitement for that. Such a piece of crap lol. Apples and Oranges. 
---
If they themselves wanted it done, they would've done so, especially mobile since they're making tons more money from that.
---
You need to edit your graph it seems like the column titles for GW2 FF and WoW are misplaced.
---
Based on 1) "we are not going to save things for expansions anymore" - ANET's statement from last year. And 2) Season 5 is next instead of an expansion. Why enumerate the season number instead of just continuing season 4 for another 6 episodes? To me, it means season 5 will be significantly different from season 4 in structure and delivery. Also if it were to be another 6 episode season, then that confirms there's no expansion on the horizon for another ~1.5 years until the season ends and  leads into said expansion. That would make it more than 2 years since the last expansion.
---
&gt; They should learn a lesson or two from him about communication.
---
... remember when they forbid him to talk on the forums and reddit ?
---
No credit for reposting the number 1 post on r/all?
---
Everyone will have their opinions on what this actually means for the quality and quantity of each game. Based on this stuff, what do **I** feel the GW2 team ought to do to bring itself more in line with the others? I'm not including this in the main post because I expect disagreement with at least one of these things.
---
* Make a lot more effort to revitalize older content. Release LS1, no excuses. Hell, do it as a yearly event so people know it's coming, and can experience it paced as it originally was. Rework dungeons, update them, and add achievements for them with modern rewards - can you imagine just how many people would come back for Hi-Definition Arah armor, or improved cultural armor?
---
* Improve core systems like the Outfit panel. We get that Outfits let you be more flexible in terms of clipping and so on, but really, we can't even sub in our own hats, when you let us hide the outfit hats already? That feels like weak sauce.
---
* Improve content guidance. There's a new concept post about this on this sub every 3-4 months - clearly there's demand. Not just for tutorial improvements, but for achievement pane upgrades, and so on.
---
* Stop being so damn shotgun about communications. Build a release schedule, and stick to it like fucking iron. Set minimums for content, and never ever deviate from the minimum viable product. Got a new feature ready early? Great, release it next window, don't 'surprise and delight' the playerbase. Something delayed? Release what you have, because you know what your MVP is, then polish the delayed thing to make it even better. The more deviation you introduce, the more you allow the playerbase to criticize you on that lack of reliability.
---
* Release a Gem store subscription for reliable value. $9.99 USD per month, netting users a specified slightly-higher-than-single-purchase amount of gems. No game perks, just gems, with a small bonus on volume. Recurring billing is one of the ways reliability can be forced into the developer's pockets, and I think people would be willing to do that - some (like myself) already budget an amount each month for this purpose, whether we see a shiny in the gem store that we want or not.
---
That's all I've got for now.
---
I love that you are saying “let’s be nice to each other” after calling people who have had made tremendous contributions to the game and community “deadweight”.
---
Seems to me like you’re happy to dish out but not happy to take.
---
And this is why this game will never truly improve.
---
There's plenty to do if you're just starting out and take your time. There's no sub and since you already bought the expansions, why not just play and enjoy the game until you don't.
---
During the initial release, the developers had to remove any Cantha references at the last minute because NCSoft executives found the depiction of Asian cultures offensive. The Crown Pavilion in Divinity's Reach was originally going to be a Canthan district. If NCSoft hasn't changed their views on Cantha since 2012, we'll probably never see it in-game.
---
Anet 2012 - 270 ppl, ~150m revenue
---
Anet 2018 - 400ppl, ~70m revenue  
---
I agree it's a reality check, with no new products delivered it wasn't suistanaible from a business perspective. NCSoft didn't kill the company, they basically shrink it to the numbers that they had back around GW2 release, yes it's painful to see that some of the victims are long standing ones but other than that i would say it's anet own demise if someone made decision that stuff they're wasting resources for few years now is so bad that it's only worth scrapping
---
or leaving voluntarily as i think he said he did - and being laid off doesn't mean being fired. they are different
---
I just don't know how to respond to this. Because my mind simply cannot understand how getting exotic gear is a hardcore approch. 
---
The sheer amount of ressources out there alone ...
---
People can progresss through the content, get comfortable with fractals, learn until t4, and once you're able to run t4 you should have enough understanding of the game to do raids.
---
It would be a shame if the endgame content was accesible in my lvl 80 boost soldier gear, wouldn't it?
---
Jesus christ, just "tooltip fixes, bug fixes, and meaningless changes "? Do you even look at the build panel? We've had massive shakeups across all the classes. Herald got totally reworked as did the Soul Reaping line of Necro. Not to mention massive changes like the removal of passive procs like Engie's elixir and the changes from weapon-specific traits to ones that give something and then more for holding the weapons. This is what I mean when I say that I wonder if people play the game, because you would appreciate that there's been so much more than just tooltip fixes.
---
Given that it took me almost a year to gain 500 ranks from rank 100 I would not be happy with that at all. It’ll make playing WvW far less enjoyable by making it an absolute grind to unlock the mount. It’s gotta be more obtainable than that.
---
I would say when you unlock the first extra pip, that’s like rank 150 or something. Not so short but also not so incredibly long to get it, so that completely new players will still feel like they can get it in a reasonable amount of time.
---
How many hours would it take to get to rank 2000? I don’t think it’d be reasonable to expect players to invest that much time to get this one mount. 
---
Then you can start a small collection or something to get the mount. Maybe make people do the alpine borderlands jumping puzzle :p. Or something in the Obsidian sanctum,
---
u/Zazurra heres confirmation [https://imgur.com/a/XZPkNzq](https://imgur.com/a/XZPkNzq)
---
I think how they monetize PvE has worked well for them.  I don’t think they need to specify fractals per se but they definitely could.  People love convenient items.  WvW suggestions I’ve come up with and seen are things like siege bags, unique commander icons or more colors, siege skins, and even prioritized queue (which I don’t agree with).  The question also arises what is worth being a gem store item versus quality of life or use with the ability system.  I personally think anything that can make things easier but aren’t necessary to gameplay are worth adding to the gem store.  Build templates is a good way for them to make money for example.  Give 3 slots for 3 builds then add additional slots on the gem store.  Roamers and hardcore PvE players would eat that up.
---
When it comes to MMORPGs, it’s just not the flavor anymore.  That’s why they aren’t being made.  All the hype has moved on.  It was mostly a trend.  Now all the money is in mobile gaming and battle royales.  That’s where developers have shifted their attention.  Not all of them but you can see EA and Activision both pushing to get into those markets.  The biggest game right now is Apex Legends.  It’s not WoW or even Fortnite anymore.  It seems as if every 5-10 years the mainstream of games shifts.  Sure there are still other games being developed and still MMOs in the works but that’s not where the most money to be made is.  This really hurts companies like Anet because they have to find a way to keep our attention and staying in their games.  If we go off and play Apex or Fortnite, we are more likely to spend money there than we are with an older game like Gw2.  The gaming industry is brutal and unforgiving of development time.  You can see this clearly with the recent layoffs at big companies like Blizzard and even Anet.
---
Well, I do completely expect a road map. I have over 12k hours in the game and LS while nice isn't enough for long term support. If I don't see an expansion on the table soon, I fear less and less to return for. Honestly, a game at this age, if it doesn't have clearly defined plans for continued content, it's clear that the company behind it isn't going to support further. If the devs clearly tell us no expansions what hope is there. This isn't assumptions players have made. Anet told us directly, no expansions, we will continue to spoon feed you tiny peas of content every 4 months for the next year. That plan was laid out directly from Anet. 
---
Probably.  It burned up content when people would gladly buy expansions.  
---
It is most likely going to be the same as how Gliding was added.  Anything else doesn't really make sense since they want this for all users to get fairly quickly.  They are not going to do a timegate that would be unobtainable for new wvw players in any reasonable timeframe.  This is an attempt to add players to the game mode, not raise the entry barrier to wvw.
---
I am at just over level 5600 so I have the levels to get this right away if it was done with a rank barrier but I don't care if new players can get this new mount right away.  Frankly I see all the people posting for a high barrier just want this as a wvw exclusive item when they run around in pve and can say 'look at me and my fancy mount you can't have, suck it noob, haha'.  
---
This is not a skin like the legendary wvw backpack/armor where you can get equivalent from other means it is a new mount that will probably not be better than other mounts in pve at anything but it does look like it will be an advantage in wvw play.  The adding of gliding was fine, only a few wvw levels to have it but a few more to max it out, do it the same on the mount. 
---
No, veterans (like one of the fractal devs confirmed) often choose to leave because they know their work is worth more and they can take a fall so the talented people under them can keep their jobs.
---
Season 1 damaged the game, in my opinion. From Season 2 onwards, the implementation improved drastically, but they're still not really there yet and may never be.
---
ncsoft dont give a fck about gw 2 or players XD
---
they making money from another games and if gw 2 doesnt make profit,they gona stop funding,its ez as that. ask EA how much they care for players :D
---
Everytime there's an update, I buy gems.  I don't buy gems any other times.  I think thtat's a fair way to handle things.  
---
I still cant believe Gail was laid off. You work for a company for 18 years and this is how they reward you? What a joke
---
What does a cele roamer provide that other classes don't? 
---
Cele roamer is full melee with no access to ranged capabilities, have supbar damage, mediocre survivability (you have to burn a whole water / earth rotation to sustain what a warrior or other could just tank through), okey-ish CC and your damage depends on a complex blast dance that exhausts all your cooldowns while other classes have access to the same might capabilities at the press of a button, or passively. Also, with the amount of boon removal nowadays, it's super easy to just rip off an elem of its damage.
---
Maybe it's just me but I feel like Twist of Fate is the worst utility I've seen. A 40sec CD break-stun for a 1sec evade (which is also a 1sec where you're not doing anything else) isn't something to be exited about. Sure, it's got two charges, but then what? Mesmers, thieves and rangers have similar yet better versions of this skill, coupled with many other useful utilities. Twist of Fate being a insentive to play weaver just shows how bad the rest of the elem utilities are honestly. 
---
Given they have nothing else on the horizon, it's not that naive.. They need money.
---
It's a lot of content, but i loooove how they tell their stories. I'm invested in the quests i did so far. It's not that daunting to level there. If you don't spend your time stealing from every house you encounter like me you'll be 50 in no time. As in GW2 there are lots of people around.   
---
And as Arisalis said they put content out every quarter. The two new dungeons went live yesterday and they will lead to the Story of the Chapter Elsweyr that's come out in June that not only introduce the region of Elsweyr but will add a new class as well. Then two Story DLC will hit Q3 and Q4 that will continue the story of Elsweyr. 
---
With the pint anet made to us, yes its imperative at this point to get a roadmap out in about the next 30 days. They directly told us, no expansions, They intend to spoon feed tiny peas of content to us every 4 months for the next year. I have no long term plans for this game anymore. Not with the promise they made of no real content. They can say what they want, you can say what you want as a player but LS is seriously just spoonfuls every 4 months, it's not enough. I have 12k hours in the game, in other words, been there and done that. WvW kept me going much longer than I would have, but then there is no real meaningful changes or content there either. Its time. They need a roadmap. 
---
someone made decision to scrap their other projects, not rework not reshuffle to other studios but completely cancel, it's not very often that this happen to the projects that are atleast at stage that industry knows about it's existence. Anet worked one or more of them i would say atleast since 2015, that means that their work was so bad that they decided it's better to scrap 3-4 years of work that took a lot of resources instead of do something with it
---
I appreciate what you're doing.  :)
---
Looking back at six years and the changes over them, I've put a few screenshots of the changing look of my main character up (2,1,3,4 order).
---
https://akai-to.tumblr.com/post/183073917798
---
So.
---
Many.
---
Buttcapes.
---
My theory as to how it can happen that you get friended:
---
The party invite UI (invite to party, invite to squad) and right click mail sending sometimes refuse to work unless you friend the other person first. I try to unfriend people after doing this, but I usually forget to do so all the same.
---
I'm a little sad that GW2 was neglected, happy that it will be more of the focus, but also sad that they won't branch out into other games. I know I would hate for the new game/baby to take precedence over GW2, but I also would hate for the company to bet everything on one game. Hopefully NCSoft was smart and told them to focus on GW2 \*and\* ONE other side project to diversify.
---
No I think not setting it out as well before the game was coming out was a bad idea but its a good idea to branch expansions and to give players content no matter how much.
---
Imo yes, very much so. Go back and look at some of the fantastic maps from previous releases and they're wastelands, devoid of virtually any players. That's a massive waste of resources especially considering at worst the map might be played through once or twice by most players resulting in a couple hours of use then abandoned, at best it becomes a one off farm where bulk players show up for one meta event then disappear. 
---
Honestly they should make each living world release something like a fractal, where you play it once for the main story solo then you have the option of unlocking smaller portions of it as "dungeons" with challenges to keep interest going and make this something players are going to keep playing in the long(er) run. Tell me you wouldn't want a semi difficult dungeon with a variation of Aurene and everyone going after Kral, it'd be fun and keep the content relevant. 
---
I agree with this. 
---
Haven't people been waiting for a year for a new raid? Think maybe these guys deserve to be canned based on how many of these modes are stuck in 2014.
---
Fractals haven't really changed much at all to warrant continuing someone's salary to work on them, same for raids... and wvw....
---
If they have 400 people they are really not prioritizing stuff besides the story content, which could probably be done by at most 20 to 30 people.
---
But what are all these other people even doing for these modes that never get updates?
---
Fractals have difficulty modes, are much shorter, and more people playing them. They still only make 1-2 new ones every year
---
I agree 100%. Even small promises have been neglected.  Look at legendary weapons.   That’s a HoT product advertised with that release and still is not completely shipped almost, what, 4 years later?
---
what? lineage, lineage 2, city of heroes, aion, blade &amp; sould. NCSoft made fuckton of mmos, actually wildstar wasn't even made by ncsoft but similar to anet case just owned by them
---
- Roadmap
---
- More frequent updates (at least every 2 month)
---
- Build Templates ( and fractal leaderboards... )
---
Here's what gives me FUD.
---
For one, the number of senior leadership let go. Yeah, that's normal. Companies see labor as a cost and not a productive asset, I get that. However, when you make a routine habit of purging your vets to save costs, I'm going to imagine that you get what you pay for. I suppose if it left them completely uncompetitive, it wouldn't be done. Doesn't mean it can't get bad - I've seen devs in key positions put games in bad places. So how confident can we be in new leadership is subject to question right now.
---
Two, we *don't* know that they're working on other projects. But here's the thing. "[Guild Wars 2 will not be affected but with fewer developers working on it.](https://www.mmorpg.com/guild-wars-2/news/arenanets-offices-closed-for-two-days-as-layoffs-begin-ahead-of-restructuring-1000051606#gsmgOZ0Qx0a9fstx.99)" The final sentence of that article. I have very little reason to believe that we will see volume and quality of content improve.
---
Three, we have *no* idea what the future holds beyond season 5. We have no insight into the plans for this game.
---
Four, the existence of season 5 guarantees absolutely nothing. NCsoft shuttered City of Heroes while they were publicly discussing a new expansion. They did this days after acquiring ANet.
---
What [Josh Foreman](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/av0llg/josh_foremans_words/) had to say on the subject is heartening. But I want more. Specifically, I want more from working management at both ANet *and* NCsoft. And ideally, I'd like ANet to get out from NCsoft's clutches as soon as humanly possible.
---
Yeah, people here only pretend 100 people who lost the job were the ones working mostly on gw2, not the "cancelled projects".
---
I still remember him getting into trouble right around the first release of SAB because he _talked to the community too much_ , that "no big PR bullshit" part specifically is one of the reasons I like that guy so much. 
---
I don't think it tell us much. It just a revenue chart, not showing profits which is more important and what really matters..
---
I want to start out by saying I think they did Gaile dirty by getting rid of her after almost 20 years, I consider it unethical and scummy to do that to long time employees.
---
That said from the perspective of some one that was put on the Mod Hit List on the official forums as many Redditors have been I'm optimistic that the forums will become less draconian and more open to discussions where people can talk like people with out the fear of being Secret Policed.  I carried my self the same way on the official forums as I do with my family, co-workers, patients, and friends; unfortunately that was considered too controversial for Gaile and her Regime I guess, so yes I have high hopes for the official forums from here on out.
---
Holy crap FFXIV... a shame that its a weebs game otherwise...
---
&gt; We've had massive shakeups across all the classes
---
Are you serious? Okay let's see.
---
&gt; Herald got totally reworked
---
That's not true. It got a couple of new traits, and 2 skills were changed (one of those isn't even Herald related). That's not a total rework and in most gamemodes didn't change anything about rev. I used to play support rev in PvP every now and then for fun but these changes were just enough to nuke my spec which was already a bad spec. 
---
&gt; as did the Soul Reaping line of Necro
---
You mean the part where they nerfed a trait and maybe changed 2 other traits? Wow what a rework, literally 0 impact. Nothing new came of it.
---
&gt; Not to mention massive changes like the removal of passive procs like Engie's elixir
---
So instead of the previous elixir proc they take the new elixir proc in the same slot. What a massive change! I'll roll engi asap to test all the new builds that'll come from it! Oh wait..
---
These are literally nothing. Tuning at best, raw damage/healing output adjustments and removal of some passive procs for weaker ones. No gameplay changes whatsoever.
---
This is a situation where you are framing the data to fit your narrative. If you extend it back to the start of GW 2 things would be much different. 
---
Also constant subs is a strange comparison. I like that it shows value vs content. But it does take a lot of liberties. It would be interesting to see you throw ESO in there. Also comparing maps in one game is a really tough comparison. 
---
I mean, in all fairness, one of the biggest complaints is that we got no skins in-game anymore.
---
Just in LS4 alone we have gotten two new weapon sets, a new armour set, and a boatload of misc skins including another chest and leggings skins which tend to be the one they skip. Their in-game skin content game has *massively* improved over the last while and I never see anyone talk about it.
---
They even added tons of story and direction to those new weapon/armour sets so they have history and meaning to them, which was another big thing the community had wanted rather than them being RNG unlocks.
---
I play on and off and I've seen five or so.
---
&gt;However, your words in both your first post and your response have left me with the impression that you are simply not a nice person, and so I’ll use my internet powers and just ignore you from now on.
---
Wow that's quite an assumption. Seriously what is wrong with you dude. 
---
&gt; I just want them to stick true to their vision of the game.
---
Sadly, the original vision of the game was basically Living World Season 1.
---
The amount of experimentation and 'innovative content strategy' employed in the first two years of the game hurt its future strategic options more than anything else could have.
---
&gt; What were their visions for these game modes and how did they want them to represent this franchise.
---
This is super important to balance against market expectations, and it's where GW2's fallen down hardest imo.
---
I hate weebs with passion, but I survived in ff14 for a year. Its not that bad.
---
1)Wow is a cultural phenomenon. Its huuuge.
---
2) Blizzard has many other games and IPs. Anet has only gw2.
---
You are right, i restarted HoT story last week for achievements, but didnt notice this change in auric basin until today lol! ty :D
---
its mostly the art and voice that REALLY puts me off those type of games.
---
&gt; So yes, I honestly don't get this whole "labor of love" stuff. Maybe that's how the developers felt, but it definitely is not how their game ever felt to me. 
---
I can totally buy that claim. The problem is that the times when I am convinced of that is when I see something along the lines of "I can see the devs really loved this but I wish they took a couple steps back into reality".
---
I think so. The living world is filler content not really repeatable end game content.
---
If it was a choice I would take an expansion instead of the living world.
---
We still don't know very basic things, like who he really is, or where he came from.
---
&gt; I remember a time when there was literally no meta build for Engie or Necro!
---
Well I don't remember such a time! Because I play more than just PvE. It's clearly that you're only talking about PvE which is why you don't understand what I'm saying.
---
&gt; but if you don't get that things like 10-man tempest boon application
---
For example this is literally *nothing* in PvP. *Nothing.* Tempest is shit there and increasing the target cap does nothing in te first place.
---
Really? Hm. My try it then, I downloaded ESO yesterday and I'm eager to try it as well.
---
&gt; moving staff off GW2 attributed to slow progress, GW2 team members moving off the game
---
It's not a coincidence that the source for that information is a former employee who was controversially fired and has a grudge against ArenaNet management and who's profession happens to be writing narratives and positioning readers to take a chosen position on an issue.
---
It's depressing to see how eagerly the community bought into that manipulation and spread it like wildfire to ensure maximum damage could be done by it. The same community that went after that dev with torches and pitchforks.
---
Currently it's not a verified fact that GW2 devs were moved off of GW2 onto other projects, how long they were moved off or what impact that had on GW2's development. Maybe they were only moved temporarily and sparingly when it made sense to do so. Maybe the impact of these decisions was exaggerated by a former employee who had an axe to grind with the management that fired her?
---
A rumour started by a fired employee combined with a perceived lack of quality in Season 4's releases resulted in doomsday speculation. The raid and fractals since PoF were both good, no previous season had a feature like a mount let alone two and I still think Jahai Bluffs is the best Living World addition since Silverwastes so while quality was inconsistent in Season 4 (which is true for every season imo) overall I think people judge it unfairly.
---
It would be nice if people could wait for facts to be revealed and avoid going down a spiral of conspiracy theories built off of an incredibly unreliable source. People are so aggrieved with ArenaNet over their own perceived imperfections with GW2 that they don't care what kind of collateral damage their fear-mongering causes in their attempts to exploit this to push their grievances.
---
You're right in that we don't have confirmation if there are more people working on GW2 now, but the more I think about it, the more it seems like the only intelligent possibility.
---
From what I've been able to gather from posts on the front page, ANet has been working on two unannounced/unknown to us side projects for the last few years and they've been steadily moving devs off of GW2 for these projects over the last couple years. Now I don't know if all 100 lay offs are devs, or if there's some PR people or marketing or whatever in there. For brevity's sake, lets say all of them were devs or in some way related to the side projects. (Yes I'm aware a few gw2 devs were laid off/no longer work at Anet).
---
Just because 100 were laid off doesn't mean only 100 were working on those projects. It doesn't make sense to lay off **everyone** related to the side projects. Surely they'll move the higher profile devs back to GW2 considering it is now Anet's only project.
---
I can guarantee you there were not 300 people working on GW2 prior to the lay offs. If there were, there is something seriously wrong with the structure of ANet or the quality of devs. To put it in perspective, Witcher 3 had ~240 devs and Skyrim had ~100.  There is no possible way that 300 people were working on the game considering the pace of updates if everything is okay in the company.
---
What we do know now is that ANet has roughly 300 employees and is now completely dedicated to GW2. The amount of people working on GW2 better have increased or IDK what those people are working on.
---
The issue isn't the lack of "anything goes". As example in GW1 there were also group compositions. No one got a problem with teams searching for a guardian, ele or whatever. It's also not difficult to switch your useless signet for a banner or any other usefull skill.
---
The issue are: 
---
-equipment - a huge upfront investment. 
---
-Time required for training. Another huge upfront investment.
---
 -there is no easy role, everyone needs to move/dodge etc.
---
This scares players away, so only a small percentage of GW2 players is raiding.
---
It becomes very apparent when you compare GW2 to GW1. In GW1 equipment doesn't matter. "Everyone welcome" basically.
---
You would usually place a beginner in an easy to play role as dps. You'd tell him where to position himself. If he fucks up your backline (or dps with control skills) helps him out. He plays the content and learns by doing. No training required, no reading of guides or anything. I ran through story content and then joined my first "raid" group. With exactly the same build etc. - and it was all good. Wouldn't work well in GW2.
---
In GW2 boss does a fancy animation and your dead. Without knowing what has happened. There are huge differences between equipment variants. Equipment is expensive. Someone who plays 1h/week would need to spend 100% of his ingame time on raid training - for months. Without even knowing if he likes raids at all. Huge upfront investments scare player away.
---
While you can go into AC1. Might take you one hour, but in the end you'll succeed. And if you repeat this (or similar) content often enough you might consider to switch your runes for better ones etc.
---
The "natural" way of improving your gameplay, not by reading guides and training rotations on a golem.
---
Raids are, by design, made to be played by a tiny group of hardcore players. You can range lupi to death. You can rezz completly dead people in this fight, while one player kites lupi around. T4 fractals require you to repeat fractals are lot, so you get trained. There are no easy-mode raids to slowly learn mechanics etc.
---
Training squads etc. can't fix these issues. For a dedicated player who is willing to get into raids at any costs they are helpful, yes. But they won't result in masses of open world casuals becoming raid players. It's still a too huge entry barrier. Which is what makes raids hardcore - less their actual difficulty.
---
While in GW1, if you weren't speedrunning stuff - people were okay with any player who runs the required class. Combat mechanics also allowed to help each other out more than in GW1, so even a bad healer mattered a lot less than in GW2.
---
TL;DR: GW2s mechanics result in players excluding others, this results in a low playerbase for difficult content. Other games did a better job at integrating bad/new players into more experienced teams, resulting in "learning by doing" instead of huge upfront investments for newbs.
---
1 of the best things that made Guild Wars 1 so unique and successful was that they didn't make expansions like every other game does (until the end before they told us about GW2 to cut ties with GW1 and start something new). They actually made Campaigns that told an entirely new story, with new advancements of their technology and story telling with new professions that were like no other and amazing looking creatures with a beautiful landscape to put them in. The best part of these campaigns were that all 3 of them was set in different regions which had different cultures. Everything felt so... fresh and new like as if i bought an entirely new game. I really wished during the production of GW2 that they were going to continue this trend and continue that legacy of "Different."
---
I understand that making an entirely new game would take a very long time, but would come out successful in the long run i would believe just like their other campaigns from GW1.  
---
Don't get me wrong, our expansions have been good.. but they have been a very slippery slope on playability which hurts. PoF hit me in the feels with nostalgia and i wish there was more to do over there.
---
Saying that, this is why i believe the legacy of Campaigns from this franchise should've continued. They were so immersive, special and unique. Prophecies brought us Elite zones (UW, FoW), Factions brought us Urgoz and The Deep, Nightfall brought us DoA. All replayable areas that were fun, rewarding and rememberable. Yes I understand EotN brought us Dungeons etc. but they could've easily added that idea to any new campaign.
---
I liked the idea of living world stories where it would keep us playing and getting new maps etc. But like everybody else has mentioned, The maps die, the rewards aren't as good, and then we're waiting for the next 1 to arrive. I do appreciate that they're free for us while we wait for a new expansion, but i still don't think this was the right way to go in my opinion. 
---
People who play the game still use the same talking points to defend the game too. A lot of which has changed. GW2 has changed, and also other games have seen what GW2 had done in 2012 and adapted.
---
 - You don’t have to have wait to have fun
---
 - It doesn’t make you grind
---
 - You can share resources and mob kills
---
 - You can bring any class to do difficult content
---
I think it's a great stop gap between expansions. However that could change depending on what's cooking in LS Season 5. 
---
People like to over exaggerate the lack of content in the living story. If you take each episode with a more holistic approach, you will find so much more content. Take the latest episode. New weapon set, multiple hearts, multiple adventures, new metas, new minis, new story, new mastery, tons of achievements, maybe even some new weapons. 
---
Together that's pretty good. Obviously we could be getting more, but for free, I dig it. 
---
So I guess I just want to ask....what more are you guys (who find the new content small) looking for exactly?
---
McKenna did the original post about World Alliances, but the most recent update on it was done by Raymond Lukes. 
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/61986/world-restructuring-update-2
---
Some resources I found for ESO:
---
https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fextralife.com/DLC (I think this is closest to what you're looking for.)
---
https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fextralife.com/Patch+Notes
---
https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Patches_(Online)
---
In my opinion the best game to compare Guild Wars 2's releases to is ESO. It has an excellent business model that is sustainable for the developers and fair to the players with it's optional sub and DLC.  
---
ESO has already laid out an entire roadmap for how 2019 is going to go down, with content updates and planned features, the latest patch just released yesterday with both paid and free content! GW2 really needs to provide a roadmap of what their plans are for the rest of 2019, it's never been more crucial for the playerbase to know what's coming than now.
---
I believe he got that from his past as a youtuber
---
there isnt a skin for the egg backpack.
---
sometimes there's a glitch where the backpack is there wherever you go.
---
I think they will but sadly we might not see it this year which is heartbreaking given that its only the end of February.  It'll take them several months to get back on track and then several more to develop new content.  That alone is telling me minimum 3-4 months before we start to see any kind of changes.  It'll be after S5 starts which again is easily another 3-4 months away.  The unknown is worrisome for sure though.
---
Yeah, you're not wrong. Part of the issue is that most arguments I see on reddit and discords about this kind of thing is that they cherrypick very heavily - which I did sort of have to do, but I tried to put it as arms-length as possible.
---
There's a huge amount of information missing, for sure, and a lot of that is because so much of this relies on quantity-only rather than actual quality of content, or setting out a standard metric for quality in the first place.
---
&gt; It would be interesting to see you throw ESO in there.
---
I'll see what I can do, 2 other users have suggested adding ESO already. If their patch notes pages are easy to read I might be able to do it easily.
---
&gt; Also comparing maps in one game is a really tough comparison.
---
Ugh, you're telling me. This is the one puke-worthy over simplification in the post, imo, but I felt it had to be included because it comes up as a way to 'prove' GW2 is "just focused on open world, guise!" every time these discussions happened.
---
LS1? Yes. I understand that ANet thought it was cool and really wanted to try it. I understand that sometimes it's worth taking a risk just for the sake of innovation. But I do believe that LS1 was a mistake in every way.
---
At the time, it frustrated players because it started as too little content too infrequently (the much memed signs) and ended with too much content too frequently. A lot of players felt like they couldn't keep up with new content every two weeks, especially because most of that was temporary so if you didn't play then, you'd never play it. Personally I didn't have a problem with too much content too quickly, what frustrated me was weird stuff like Tequatl and the Super Adventure Box being *totally* story relevant.
---
It burned out the devs too. That's why when people asked them last year to stagger their releases (to release the raids/fractals one or two weeks after the living world episode) they essentially said "my doctor told me not to go back to 24/7 shipping".
---
And now that it's gone... Well, the hole it left behind is probably the worst thing that ever happened to the franchise's story and if not the worst, at least one of the big stones thrown in the way of new player retention.
---
LS2-4? No, I don't think so.
---
 So after all the recent ArenaNET layoffs (Hope everybody can find a better job), I've been wondering whether it is viable to invest in the game for the long run, or should I just stay away and wait for GW3 or even find a new MMORPG?
---
Thanks a lot.
---
Gw2 would eventually end up in the same position as Halflife without the layoffs.
---
Add into that: Grim Dawn and Hollow Knight with their new content coming, it's been a fucking emotional rollercoaster.
---
You do have a point.
---
Hours on map development does cost money and has nothing to do with my question.
---
No new maps. They should go back to all the LS and pof maps and add events to them, fix their problems, make them worth visiting.
---
That way they can add a lot of replayability to open world without having to build completely new environments.
---
For instanced pve I'd like a focus on fractals, we need more replayable content. More fractal CMs. Probably more raids too, more focus on bosses with interesting mechanics than on pretty environments (my dream xpac definitely focuses on instanced content instead of story.)
---
I can't speak for pvp and wvw.
---
you better hope anything comes after lw5 before asking for cantha
---
Criminy the number of incremental patches...
---
Yeah, that's about as good as it could be. I'll do what I can with it.
---
Because those resources are being spent on raids, among other things.
---
But episodes 4 and 5 were good, 5 was amazing actually.
---
As far as content goes, it's turned into a bad model.
---
I am not looking forward to a new map each release that features about 2 hours of story and then some random grind for trinkets, a hastily designed armour set or a weapons collection that people won't be in the map long enough to finish.
---
Expansions are by far the most fun I've ever hard with the game, outside of initial launch. Elite specifications are the biggest breath of fresh air that the game ever receives.
---
There was nothing wrong with the GW model, it was an outstanding success. Sure with GW2 being a much more expansive game the pace would be slower, but 18 months between expansions with 400 (dedicated) developers should have easily been possible.
---
Bruh, by that logic you should be taqgging up in PoF and call it end game content too. The Maw of Torment and Serpetn's Ire both have a 100% chance of giving you an intact Mosaic which is worth over 5 gold. That item alone, baring anything else that might drop (of which there are a LOT of options worth money) means that the metas of PoF are worth more than Teq, more than Verdant Brink, and honestly not that far off HoT meta's total gold gain per meta.
---
And all of what you have stated is not ACTUAL content still! It's just you saying "I liek this thing" which is far from a common metric. I bloody love fighting the unique bosses and exploring on Sandswept Isles, but despite being a better map with more unique bosses than Tarir, nobody will do it, because all they want is rewards.
---
That's the real unpopular opinion here. That people only do content that pays, and nothing else. Dungeons died when the money went away, open world maps are called bad regardless of content because they don't offer enough gold, etc. The bulk of players just want the shiny, actual content be damned.
---
I could get behind monetization of living story if they were part of something larger e.g. includes a new mounts / classes / armors. On their own however it is debatable whether I (or other people) would buy them - because lets face it: once you have put your 3/4 hours into a new map your probably aren't going back. 
---
Introducing lots of "temporary" content has been one of the studio's big problems. Dungeons being left to rot. No reason to revisit new maps. Desert / EOTM WvW map debacles. One off living world events. WvW tournaments. Don't get me wrong, arena net do some amazing stuff, but they need to work out how to keep new content relevant, and fresh.
---
&gt; legendary collections are amazing in areas
---
Retreading over things you've already done many times before is certainly not amazing. Neither is waiting around for broken events. Neither is relying on RNG for a collection item. Even worse if that drop comes from an event that runs every 45 minutes.
---
I know a lot of folks who moved over from GW2 to BDO particularly who were WvW players early on. It looked like such a great game at launch, shame about how it turned out.
---
Technically the last content for GW1 was in 2010-11 with winds of change.
---
&gt; EoTM was only real addition and they killed that themselves. 
---
EotM was built for the Chinese market. It was intended to solve the queue problems on overpopulated servers that GW2 only say in the first two years of the game's life. By the time EotM was released, there was no need for it in NA. They built it for China.
---
You think marketing is at fault for not being able to change first impressions? That's just reality - once people try something and make their mind up on it, no marketing campaign is going to solve those problems. The only game I've ever heard of successfully doing that is FFXIV and they went to extraordinary lengths to relaunch their game from a bad initial launch, which likely cost a lot of money to do.
---
The core game is still free, and the back catalogue of expansion and Living World content is still abundant. Guild Wars 1 is still being maintained and still has a playerbase. I don't think GW2 is about to have the plug pulled. 
---
At the moment, nobody really knows. I do think we'll get more content, though, even if it's just the end of LS4 and then a Living World final season. 
---
What happened was very unfortunate and lots of the public face of Anet have gone, but we don't *really* know what has happened and Anet haven't given a statement other than that they'll carry on producing content and that they need time to deal with what has happened. 
---
The fact that ArenaNET have been made more efficient, however brutal that may be, means that GW2 is now its sole focus. 
---
Short version: Core is free. HoT and PoF frequently go on sale. The only thing you'll lose is a little time. 
---
Because I think the difference of a month or two makes a big difference in how you view the time period. Three bracketing months do a lot to change the moving average of comment release, and I think it's more informative than simply putting a cutoff on 2018.
---
you're incredibly stupid if you think that mike o'briens' salary is anywhere near satoru iwata's
---
&gt; The problem with Anet is not last years sales, but the fact that they dont have nothing to sell in the future.
---
How do you know what they do or don't have for the future? Do you have inside knowledge we don't?
---
Buy insignia and inscriptions of the harrier off the TP and stat-swap ascended armor/weapons.  Trinkets are the hard part.  
---
It looks like most people probably isn't even aware that those armors exist if you look at the stats https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.search=mastery
---
Obviously gw2e doesn't have everyone, it only has around 211k accounts represented and I would expect it to be biased but it woudl be biased towards people who are less casual. If those are inflated percentages then a very tiny portion of the playerbase have actually gotten them or seen them.
---
No, I said I have finished the stories on my main, and am currently doing season 2 on one of my alts. :) The other alts are further behind.
---
He's not the only developer talking about GW2 being neglected. Also, there's more clips in his twitch channel where he says things like "pulling important people such as myself away from GW2 for long periods of time".
---
You can play blind all you want, but that's not going to change the obvious. This is a moment for reflection and learning from past mistakes, not for white knighting.
---
As another jumping puzzle fan here, there is no interpretation where getting rid of Josh is a good idea. :(
---
Please clarify that Aaron Linde and Ben Arnold (and others?) volunteered to leave.
---
Goldangit. Every time I read something like this I get excited, only to find out I already have it unlocked when I hover over the item at the vendor's ...
---
I do guild missions weekly, which brings you back to core maps. There are numerous collections and event chains and world bosses, which bring you back to core maps, at least occasionally. You also play through them to level new characters.
---
I can't say the same for the LW maps, except season 2. I can't even name most of the season 3 maps or even some of the season 4 maps anymore. The only ones I actually visited regularly were Bitterfrost Frontier (for berry farming) and Draconis Mons (since I need the materials for a consumable). Many people also visited Domain of Istan for the meta event.
---
Besides that though, those maps may as well not even exist. They are literally meaningless, completely dead, worthless content for likely 95% of players. And yet ANet has said time and time again how development heavy they are.
---
That is not a good strategy, and it has been hurting the game. My guild is dead, the raid scene is dying, PvP and WvW are dying, my friends list lights up for a week every 4 months, smaller each time, and then goes back to being dead.
---
The story and the art were good. The gameplay, however...
---
Well I would say eso&gt;ff, but ff is also decent
---
Branching out is how companies grow. Staying with a single product is how they stagnate. 
---
While I'll concede that Guild Wars 2 is an ever-evolving work, it always speaks to the same crowd.
---
I'd honestly be excited if ANet released even something as small as Fallout Shelter as a mobile game, because that would serve as proof that they can actively develop multiple products, and follow-up with supporting them after release. From an investor standpoint, this would be a huge move too.
---
All bdo has is that node wars but even that is kinda bad and cant compare to gw2, so idk. Pve is dead there.
---
It had potential for sure they just ruined it.
---
Are you people playing single player games?
---
Plenty of players will happily sit through a few months of not being "super" excited just to play with their friends and guilds. Why would you give them up for another game immediately?
---
But if rather than a few months of not being excited, this drags on to going full years without meaningful updates and slowly seeing the friends and guilds around you quit? Well then suddenly leaving the remainder behind hurts, but is the only logical choice.
---
It's an MMORPG, even if most of the content might they produce lately might as well be single player. I'll happily stay around in limbo of not playing at all while keeping contact with those I like to play with. Because the game in itself isn't worth playing anymore. It's gotten well past dull. But some of the remaining players can make it worth playing with.
---
Omg. I feel so shitty for laughing so hard at this.
---
Define hate, is it any form of criticism because if that's the case you're no better than the people running the official forums.  Generally in my educational experience back in the 1990s when being critical it was acceptable and constructive to say something nice before dropping in the criticism.  I've noticed on Reddit how ever and even the official forums that some times any form of criticism is considered hate, which frankly is bull %$#@ and kind of an uneducated way to look at it.
---
For example I do not think Gaile should have lost her job as she's been there almost 20 years and has left a positive legacy to many people (I'm not quite sure what since I've only played GW2 and not GW1).  That said the forums were brutally modded under her jurisdiction so I would have preferred if she had been reallocated to a PR position while replacing her in the forums with some one with a lighter touch regarding moderation.
---
If that's considered hate then feel free to ban me then, I just call speaking plainly while trying to say something positive about the person at the same time.
---
&gt; Now let's see if they can take it back where it belongs, that's the real question.
---
There has been way too many bugs that feel like they have been around for an eternity and never got fixed or problems like SI's crappy rewards versus effort ratio.
---
I prey he comes back for the next Elder Scrolls game.  I don't touch everquest and miss his work.
---
&gt; Anet wasn't the one who fired those devs, NCSoft did
---
Doesn't change the fact that decisions aren't correct just because the owning company of the game (the studio or their parent or their parent or ...) made them.
---
&gt; I'm sure that made sense for them, at least short term
---
Just how all the decisions that lead us to this point were? (Spoiler: no)
---
&gt; I should be allowed to bypass mindless grind with a credit card
---
&gt; I have nothing against asking for new non-gemstore content
---
Those two things are at odds with each other. Either there is content/rewards you can't get by simply wishing for it or buying it with a credit card, or there isn't. You can't have it both ways. I can understand the desire to want to be able to buy everything, but as I tried to explain above, that attitude/demand is destroying the game (feeling of accomplishment) for everyone who actually want's to do the content to earn the reward. It's not great, but that is how human minds work. :/
---
The bigger problem is that what GW2 calls its endgame also exists in other MMORPGs who **also** offer an item-progression based successive tier system to keep you busy on top of that.
---
Because I can also go around and grind zones until goo comes out of my ears in those. And at least in the ones I've tried, there's a **lot** of cosmetics stuff to collect until I'd run out of it and would have to go into the raid tiers / dungeon tiers.
---
What I'm trying to say is: GW2 wasted it's chance to replace the item-upgrading with a meaningful endgame system instead. Like say, a WvW-focus like DAoC had, or even an sPvP focus. Instead it has... well basically nothing.  
---
**That is not necessarily a bad thing**. Don't misunderstand me. I like intrinsic rewards, so if an activity feels rewarding to **do**, I don't think the game should feel the need to offer extra rewards just for extrinsic motivation on top of that. However, GW2 doesn't really have an upside over other MMOs here outside of some gamers prefering gameplay X and others gameplay Y.
---
&gt; Do wonder what the other project could've been, I pray it wasn't a battle royale/hero shooter/other trend chasing game.
---
&gt; Hopeful that this does indeed refocus the entire studio on what they should've been focused on the entire time: GW2. Develop more expansions/LW seasons, more raids/fractals etc and just general faster content releases. No need to chase a cash cow when you could already have one. 
---
If they wanted to chase trends, they should have implemented those game modes inside GW2 in the first place.
---
Imagine a Pokemon-esque minipet/TCG activity, or a solid PvP battle royale game.
---
I still need a road map at this point. Like, within the next 2 months at the very least, otherwise I’m just going to focus on other things that offer more concrete and laid out development cycles (looking at you Rainbow 6 and the Division 2). 
---
I am currently downloading the demo on steam to give it a go. 
---
He's a shitty person, true.  His comments when he left GW2 pissed me off, but his music can't be beat in my opinion.  
---
Grinding Gear Games is a small studio with only one game and they're making good money out of the way they manage a single project. So is Riot games. Anet has made some very bad desitions, GW2 CAN be a very successful standalone IP.
---
not gonna get anything in the march sale until they reveal their plans for the game's future tbh, so, not even that..
---
But... We don't *know* anything really. A bunch of people who were core to GW2 over the years have left the company. The rest is mostly speculation and second hand info.
---
Yeah you nailed it.
---
 I wonder if ANET would consider reintegrating it’s high level content into PvE. By that I mean making raids and fractal (really bringing back dungeons) part of the LW maps and content. It brings the communities together and slows access to them, which gives a sense of progression. There is a reason games like wow make you get “primed” or whatever you call it for raids. 
---
It just feels less meaty when you complete an episode and there isn’t a “high level” goal in the end. Imagine you finish daybreak and there is a dungeon to explore the other half of fahrenur for some reason involving... pfff I don’t know, undead scarab experiment? It would be a story after the story you could work on. Attach some achievements for completing it and all of a sudden you have a multiple tier high even content you can’t exactly blow through. 
---
I don’t know, just a thought. I recognize people love their fractals and whatever is going on with them.  
---
damage control in progress
---
It's time to move on, imo the game never became what I thought it would become. And I finally came to terms with that half a year ago. The only content I came back for was W6 and Amateur Raiding Party.
---
Ok so if I was being unclear, my question was why not leave her on as liaison between devs and player community, since for the most part, players will more than likely believe what she says, due to her name recognition in-game. 
---
I feel I didn't get a clear answer to that question from your reply.
---
Maps are fine, the maps we're getting aren't fine.
---
If they went back to the style of expanding on a single map through multiple episodes, adding events and meta events and collections to it, rather than dropping another 1-off map every couple months, it would be much better than what we have now.
---
I also don't think a map is needed *every update*. They've locked themselves into this, and pour resources into mediocre maps, but we don't need a brand new map every update, as long as they can put forth other things (dungeons, fractals, raids, new events in existing maps). They do the same thing every single update, and it. doesn't. work.
---
Sorry I have to disagree. I would muster up that ANet would be worse of without NCsoft and wouldn't have had the success of GW2 on their own even if they tried - not because they are not talented or the product is bad.
---
BUT BECAUSE: Managing a game dev company in this climate without the backing of the Big Shops with full-on publishing, marketing, AND FUNDING from shareholders is like trying to open a small business in a dead town.
---
With Big Shops, while not ideal, it is survivable to make a loss or some bad decisions or even mistakes. Gamers will protest and rage. Shareholders will cry on earnings downgrades. But the company sticks around - which is important for jobs in the LONG RUN. 
---
Small indie game devs face this day in and day out but they don't have the luxury to 'stick around' after a mistake or bad publishing/marketing strategy. They simply disappear and die. If you check out the Game Dev Industry sites, you will know this - damned if you do, damned if you don't mentality when it comes to "do I stay indie". While ANet is NOT indie, they started as such - 4 ex-Blizzard guys trying to setup shop. Within 2 years, they 'gave in' and realized to make the GW1 they wanted they needed the backing of a huge company. They were releasing a MMORPG in the PRIME time of WoW and they were trying to do without a subscription - i.e. consistent cash flow - much to the delight of gamers globally. 
---
A full scale MMORPG that doesn't have a subscription! If anything you should be praising NCsoft going on such an idea. Yes NCsoft made money from the venture - A LOT OF IT - but its a huge risk. Especially when big bad acti-blizzard would know that they would do everything possible on the game side to keep their market share intact. And an impressive job of that over the last decade. 
---
So to rail on NCsoft as they make restructuring requirements for the greater good of the whole NCsoft organization (not just the one game you guys love). And while you PC gamers will always hate mobile gaming, that is not to say mobile gaming is bad. For all the loud-mouth master-race gamers there are tons of silent gamers who do enjoy Lineage on their phone. NCsoft needs to make the decisions that are right to as (mentioned above) to stay alive in this market - that means supporting GW2 AND the rest of their portfolio in the best way possible. 
---
TL;DR Big companies help small companies survive and do what is best - keep the lights on in the game you love. Small companies cannot afford the infrastructure to do that without the cash flow that comes from subscriptions. 
---
&gt; It had potential for sure they just ruined it.
---
Like every aspect of GW2 that isn't LS? :) 
---
&gt; Anet's refusal to do a more traditional questing system or to iterate on the collection system has hurt them in the long run. Arguing if there is or isn't a end game in GW2 doesn't really mater when the end game is not remotely discoverable without a fair amount of research.
---
And this goes for more than just "the endgame".
---
The game explains you **fuck all**. Even a game as feature-overcrowded (by now) as FF14 does a **significantly** better job teaching you about its systems and objectives while playing, due to quests explicitly being marked with a `+` and those introducing you to things.
---
Easily fixable in GW2. But I feel that like many other things, a stubborn "We don't want to be like other MMORPGs, we're unique!" has worked against the game here, preventing it from adding a traditional quest system for tutorial reasons.
---
&gt; we the players never even had a word of it.
---
that is a common practice actually. there are so many suggestions and people that think they have the greatest ideas for the game or a very strong opinion on how the game should be that whatever ArenaNet would have done they would have upset the community.
---
I clearly can understand that they wanted to do something different because "having only one iron in the fire" is a bad thing. Something happens to this one thing and you are screwed. Especially if you are financed by the goodwill of your players.
---
Personally, I don't need to be told everything what they want to do or what they are doing because this is so much information in such a fleeting state that not many can actually process them or will not be able to put them into context and interpret them incorrectly.
---
ArenaNet tried to do something else and got burned by it and we found out about it. This happens a lot in the industry.
---
It's better than rushing in with the next new thing when you barely know where to go now, and let's face it, old content really needs some refurbishing.
---
&gt;We can confirm that due to the cancellation of unannounced projects, ArenaNet will make staff reductions. This is part of a larger organizational restructuring within NCSOFT in the west, but **the Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 game services will not be affected, nor is any upcoming game content canceled.**
---
I mean it's not like the information isn't there...
---
The game will continue as before. Anet always was careful with informations about "Not-yet-release-ready" stuff like the alliance system, but why should they make a statement to every single thing in the game? Alliances, PvP, PvP balancing, PvE balancing, WvW Balancing, new PvE maps, new PvP maps, LS intervall, thousand questions about achievements, armor skins, outfits, infusions (auras), halloween, wintersday, SAB, festival of the four winds, lunar new year, mounts, mount skins, weapon skins, novelties, tonics, new mobs *And So On*.
---
The list would be endless and the answer would be still the same. 
---
&gt;the Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 game services will not be affected, nor is any upcoming game content canceled.
---
-&gt; everything as always.
---
this doesnt make any fucking sense on multiple levels
---
that's not how it works
---
Agreed.  Some of his pieces could never be replaced and absolutely make games:  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O92FP7MX1c 
---
for instance.
---
I know this comment will earn a lot of downvotes, but what I gonna say is a non comfortable truth.
---
With all bad is to be laid off, McKenna Berdrow didn't make a lot of friends in the community with her decision about WvW. First of the biggest mistakes was the World Linking, one of the worst ideas ever that killed a good portion of the game mode. She kept defending it even when people already noticed how wrong was going the game mode: less and less players staying 'cos the stupid support to bandwaggoning, causing more lag in the most full servers, less incentives for playing the mode... showing a complete disconnection with the reality of the game mode.
---
Maybe NOW WvW really can be reworked for good.
---
WvW
---
Sounds legit, hope we get swimsuits too
---
No one seems to be talking about why very senior and well-loved devs are leaving or were fired. It's not about the amount of people or how profitable GW is, it's why their brightest and best are leaving. 
---
Until someone can tell me that, I will always be skeptical of something bad happening to GW2
---
Other games; it's been confirmed that ANet was working on "other prijects" that ended up not getting made; this is the fallout from that failure.
---
She seems like a really nice person and it's sad that she's gone. I imagine it will be a difficult adjustment for her after being in one place so long. 
---
However, if she was the one responsible for the heavy-handed moderation on the official forums, it might be for the best. I know a lot of people, myself included, who don't post there because of the lack of open dialogue.
---
Where can I watch the entire stream?
---
Living Story dungeons would be cool as hell.
---
Depends if that 100 were relatively new hires and 300 is back to just the GW2 core dev numbers. 
---
Yer pickin' flyshit out of pepper.
---
People are still under the impression that this is an anet problem. Please redirect all hate towards NCsoft and their greedy South Korean P2W business strategies.
---
Too soon
---
You are right there is definitely a strong performative aspect to the communal grief. The number of times I have heard people on this sub ridicule gaile gray, her role on the gw2 forums, criticise her communication with the community, and literally call for her to be fired! Then when it happens it's all tears. Classic bullying.
---
People more interested in playing = people more likely buying something from the store. Also simple economics.
---
&gt;something goes wrong
---
Wow, it's almost as if you've intentionally taken an objectively serious situation and trivialized it to create a false premise on which to ridicule others instead of addressing their points.
---
Hardcore-Mode in GW2. I like it! :D
---
I don't do serpents Ire because I don't want to bother explaining people what cc is. 
---
A lot of the devs fired were veteran gw2 devs unfortunately...
---
they said PoF, and DH is HoT, so I bet they just mean Ranger
---
If you played for 'fun' only then why did you state how much gold you make?
---
If you did not make gold playing raids, then you would probably not play them.
---
Problem with a social game is without lot of players is it's not as fun for me to play events alone. So hot metas it is then. I'd love to do PoF metas also! But yeah reward driven community or something I don't know so not enough people for the other stuff we can do.
---
I loathe all PVP. 
---
Otherwise, yes, dungeons and Fractals would be cool.
---
&gt; If you like the current state of the game, keep playing. If you don't, find something else to play. It's that simple.
---
I hope that dismissive attitude comforts you when too many decide it's not what they want anymore and NCsoft takes GW2 out behind the shed like they did with CoH.
---
Fanboys of this game should look themselves at the mirror and realize the damage their shilling has done to the game.
---
We wouldn't be where we are today if valid criticism wasn't constantly shut down by the white knights.
---
People looking for endgame are looking for games that continually add endgame content. As of right now, you can play the game a few months before completing the availible content and getting bored, then you need to wait the better part of a year to get a small new raid wing.
---
I’ve voiced recent criticism of Gaile in recent year. Especially considering her evolution since GW 1 Launch. However, when I saw that she was leaving, I legit mourned. 
---
She’s a gem and someone I look up too. Even if I didn’t always agree with her methods. 
---
Don't worry about not understanding.  I am a native speaker, and I can tell you that it's pretty poorly worded.  He's saying that Anet has worked on a lot, and only GW2 made it out to the public.  He's proud of GW2 for that.
---
Just checking, (Dragon) Hunter and Ranger are two very distinct classes.
---
bug fixing, every single bugged out map and quest fixed so that the game shines as it's meant to.
---
i feel embarrassed when i'm doing dailies in a map, there's an event marker and i am standing there waiting for the event progress only to realise it's bugged and never going to update, and having to say to newbies "it's bugged"
---
I think you misunderstand the design philosophy of GW. It was meant to be different, yet compelling.  That's why it touted things like the abolishment of the trinity, team combo-effects, and an endgame geared toward the modern-day casual.  They kept this philosophy through GW1 all the way to GW2.
---
There are reasons why GW2 are still alive and why other standard MMOs, like FFXIV and WoW are still alive. They cater to different experiences and audiences.
---
&gt;We can confirm that due to the cancellation of unannounced projects, ArenaNet will make staff reductions. This is part of a larger organizational restructuring within NCSOFT in the west, but the Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 game services will not be affected, nor is any upcoming game content canceled. [Source](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/22/arenanet-confirms-upcoming-layoffs-guild-wars-game-services-will-not-be-affected)
---
I mean "everything like always" is simple, but enough. Why would you want a roadmap (which are actually leaks) and informations about every single thing of the game, if the is always "nothing changed, everything like always"?
---
Isn't this more like trying to drag out some information about future stuff we hadn't before? Anet always was careful with talking about stuff that's (only) planed and not ready for announce yet. It's understandable, if people (ab)use every situation to demand more informations.
---
Brb killing my self 
---
I quit this game as soon as the first LW was over with, having completed all the dungeons and early fractals enough times that the game was done for me. I came back 3 months ago despite reading that it was in a decline, bought the expansions and some QoL items. I did this because the game is fun, the world is vast, and the story is amazing. None of those things are going to disappear and I want to experience them while I can. Now that I've done that, I am sticking around, because no game has come close to being this exciting for me. If anyone has a suggestion, I'll take it, but I'm not jumping ship, I'm going down with it if I have to.
---
That's what happens when any new rewards added to the game are cash shop only, so people only want gold for gold - &gt; gems conversion.
---
Don't blame the players, blame the greedy developers.
---
&gt; NCsoft has a history. They killed off City of Heroes abruptly, when it was doing pretty well for itself (had more upcoming content planned/mapped out than GW2 does now). 
---
City of Heroes was my first MMO and still holds a place in my heart, but doing well is probably an exaggeration. It was aging badly and, while profitable, was seen as a resource drain. I think NCsoft's recent actions have been to prevent something like that happening again and remind them they need to act like a business and less like an arthouse. But, anyway. Only time will tell.
---
Sorry buddy but guardian already does that 
---
They definitely should have! Polymock and Southsun sprint spring to mind.
---
They could have put a team on those and really turn them into something.
---
Days like these show how fickle the gaming community as a whole is.
---
Stepping back and taking a broader perspective of what's happening in the game industry, there are big changes going on that are rippling out to affect developers all over the world.  I've worked for 16 years in large game studios, and during the last year there have been some big changes blowing in the wind. In the last couple of months, I've been in a few meetings with some of the larger publishers. In most of those meetings, there has been a palatable nervousness about huge shifts in gamer interests of late, and in the forefront among online discussions is Fortnite. Some of EA's big titles (Battlefield, etc), for example, have failed to attract even a fraction of the audience they expected them to, and many of the larger MMO franchises (WoW, Gw2, etc.) are obviously not immune. Looking at various metrics (like Twitch viewer rates) it at first appeared that Fortnite wasn't eating too badly away at existing online games, but as time has gone on, those numbers have changed.  
---
Given that underwater is not very popular, a movie like this would be puzzling. Also boats when there are airships?
---
[Seen one](https://imgur.com/a/63TbdbQ) in dragons stand today.
---
I will be stocking op on some [fireworks](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fireworks). These ones can be dropped on the floor for others to pick up and use as well.
---
They also last forever and dont run out of fireworks.
---
Extited
---
that roadmap should have happened before 2019, now it's just damage control
---
"Boring open world PvE" is the main part of the game, you know? lol
---
However, look at the update notes since LS4 start. It's way more then only "boring open world PvE". But well, to know that you had to inform yourself...
---
No. I don't want this.
---
I mean they could always mix the two together.
---
There are so many things they could have done...
---
The wasted potential is what hurts me the most about this game.
---
&gt;How about we all take some chill pills and realize that Guild Wars 2 is financially way too stable and way too well off to be closed down anytime soon?
---
Can this be a PSA on this sub? My god are people fickle in here.
---
Honestly, now may be one of the best times to start up the game and get into it. 
---
There was a huge layoff wave that started a few days ago, and we saw some big names in the company part ways. So people were panicking thinking that this may be the end for the company
---
But from the sounds of it, based on what now-former employees have said, is that Anet may have been stretching themselves too thin and putting GW2 on the back burner for a while, and that now they have to refocus their attention on the game as a company.
---
We'll have to wait and see what changes come about, but regardless of what happens, we'll still see the game alive at least for another few years on the low end. So come on in, have some fun 
---
It's not a problem at all though, you guys are trying to make it one when you shouldn't.   
---
The mods already said no as well, so it should be clear.
---
They also promised meaningful progression outside of vertical and frankly they utterly failed there
---
Mount &amp; Balance 2: Mobile
---
So you're hoping people will continue playing a game even if they don't enjoy it in hopes that NCSoft won't shut it down. 
---
I have bad news for you: people will find other games to play when they are no longer having fun with their current game. No amount of "we must support this game at all costs" posts on Reddit will change that reality. 
---
Yeah, I got the gist of it, but thanks for clarifying.
---
Oh definitely, it's just that, given that OP has their origin in WoW, The hunter/ranger mix-up is something that I see pretty regularly 
---
I was lucky to work directly with Josh on a few projects and be desk neighbors for the last year. Josh is just as awesome of a person as you think he is. I'm heartbroken that he won't be at ArenaNet anymore but I know that just means he'll be using his time to continue to build and create awesome things. If you guys are fans of his please check out his twitch and youtube channels.
---
He's got a lot of exciting things in the works and I am hyped to be able to watch him start revealing them!
---
&gt; Why can't there be content I can choose to grind for or to buy?
---
**Because it ruins the game for everyone else**, how often do I have to repeat that? Not necessarily that one instance, but the fact that the game is being designed with this demand in mind across the board.
---
If you can't even consider a logical argument presented to you that contradicts your preexisting opinion and preference, then I am afraid there is no point in arguing anymore.
---
I’m curious how you’re so familiar with the office politics of ArenaNet. You speak with so much confidence.
---
Who the hell reposts TEXT.  What a classy guy.  Shit.  Copypasta is real in that dude.
---
Their comforting us is still on the table
---
&gt; highly inconsistent episodes in terms of replayability (Kourna eg)
---
I don't know, I hear "lack of replayability" so often, yet I still have to hear any good ideas to make it better. People demanded being bound to spend more time on the maps and Anet somehow delivered by making some collections (Commander Backpack, Elegy and Requiem Armors, Dragonsblood Weapons) require huge amounts of map currency. To be honest, I didn't find it very enjoyable to farm all the hearts on one map over and over until I've grinded what I needed. Those farming processes could take - dependant on how many characters you can use a day - literal months to complete. Still, people complain all the same.
---
So what I'm asking: What do you think Anet should do? What can you imagine that would keep you playing a map until the next one is released AND being a fun thing to do?
---
I got two from pre-ordering HoT and PoF. Then I bought one because I wasn't quite ready to get rid of my first character, a Thief. And, well, then I had eight and was missing an Elementalist, so... okay, you're right, it might be a problem.

I ones told her in GW1 how sylvari inspired me to study biology, but after graduating I couldn't find a job for 2 year. Now I am working in a industrial company on temporary contract. Hope they all find a new job soon. Though jobmarket is hard. Specially after I have read other game studios (blizzard, EA mobile) also fired people :(
---
gw2 immortal
---
 **Here's my uninformed opinion** 
---
......really?
---
It was unclear if this was some sort of high or some sort of low. GW2Efficiency still has around 10k more people. :p
---
That's the worst analogy I've ever seen. If the football breaks you can always buy another football, and all the time and effort you've put in will still be useful. No one wants to spend time and money on an MMO that is percieved to be on the way out (however valid or not that perception is) because newsflash, video games are not football.
---
I have been playing since the launch of GW2 too and that's why I can tell you she hasn't been a part of development teams, ever. She was always a community manager she doesn't write code, design or write.
---
I don't know Jost because of how talented of an artist he is. I know him because of how well he interacted with the GW2 community. I look forward to seeing his new projects. Maybe thy will include some insane jumping puzzles.
---
Idk why you would care about ascended armor for pvp, but you should just craft it. It is really annoying the first time, then easier for each time after that. Plus you can get rid of all that dust/ore/fragments.
---
Though it is stupid that they now need to throw the other project just in the bin after working on it for already a long time.
---
They're surely under NDAs about any of the unannounced projects or the internal goings on at ArenaNET.
---
To be fair, the subreddit's a bit......insane.
---
So your hypothesis is that NCSoft told them to stop working on new projects that could earn more money to instead put all efforts on an aging game with bad optimization?
---
You are saying that NCSoft...a company known for shutting down MMOs that simply aren't profitable enough in favor of pumping out new things to pump for cash decided to push ArenaNet to stop trying to diversify and make more money and instead force themselves into a death spiral on an aging game whose popularity has never been lower?
---
Why would this be a good thing?  I love GW2 and want it to grow and be more successful but when the company working on it has nothing new in the pipeline and let's go a quarter of their workforce that something is horribly wrong.
---
I’m trying really hard in DR chat to get people to give me their stuff, but nobody is!  Based on this research, I can conclude that nobody is really quitting the game.  
---
This guy (OP) took MY comment and made it into his thread! I've never ever seen such plagiarism, this is fcking disqusting, I don't even know how to react and handle this situation. At least credit me!
---
If we get one (and I doubt it) it won’t be any time soon. Studio is closed today and most will still be processing what happened yesterday for a while. 
---
Why are you twisting my words? 
---
Your first post and you already write stupid shit. If you think that ANet isn't partly to blame for this then you're retarded.
---
painful to read
---
Play what you want, but raids came out after release, and same with fractals. Do not push it on others to play. I can dislike it if I want. Have a good day. 
---
The time spent not equaling up to rewards is a problem with the whole of the game not just raids. And if you think people should play without the ability to unlock new items, then you have some issues friend. This is an RPG game after all. 'Fashion Wars 2'

Having done a very cursory search of avg wages for game design, the average for South Korea seems to be upwards of 34k/year USD, which is honestly about the average wage for a lot of employees at anet. They hire right around if not a little over the Seattle minimum wage, and wage stagnation has been a thing within that company for quite some time.
---
I think you need to stop treating south Korea as some impoverished nation. 
---
‘tis true. There’s precious little about “Living Story” content that’s different from regular old MMO content patch/expansion stuff.
---
Yes.
---
Oh i'm sorry, i thought you asked whether or not you were insane.
---
There were plenty of times when Anet was raking in plenty of cash. They had enough to keep 300-400 employees on staff.
---
They couldn't even bother to package instanced content with either expansion, the points when they got the biggest injection of both players and money
---
Bravo! I agree completely, and you even said it well! 
---
OP is a shameless karma whore who apparently thinks it's okay to copy and paste someone else's comment as his own post.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/at9kak/guild_wars_2_developer_arenanet_plans_for_mass/eh184jt/
---
"Good for the game, but perhaps not good for the studio".
---
A lot of people here are ignoring the elephant on the room. Arenanet has all eggs on one basket right now and for the foreseeable future. Let's hope for the best.
---
Damn, there's goes SAB.. You will be missed. I guess, he'll have more time to sculpt things. So, I'll be looking forward to that too.
---
New festival content instead of same copy each year and god realms like UW and FoW in GW1 (instead of raids). Those were fun for everyone, before they added dhuum and made it like a raid. Content for all is in my opinion better than content for minority of people.
---
It looks like they are cancelling other projects, then sending what employees they can back to GW2 and firing the rest. This will likely be good for the game, despite the cost.
---
The real question here is did he volunteer because he wanted a change of venue, or did he do it because he knew this game is circling the drain?
---
Haha go homeeeeee haaa
---
I dont think it is. People are still as active as 2 weeks ago in game, and nobody is giving away their stuff before deleting all chars and quitting the game
---
&gt;it was overall just too political for a fantasy online game. 
---
Possible that this is the reason that many people loved GW Factions.
---
WoW has had shared mob kills for several years now. Open world events were introduced in 2016 and don't require you to wait around for a pre event to spawn. You just go and do it.
---
If I don't want to grind dungeons/raids, I can just shit around the open world, do pet battles, world quests, or achievements.
---
I'm not stuck with playing 1 specific spec of 1 specific class if I want to heal or tank effectively.
---
I'm so glad you're here to say this. It's directly opposite of what so many people hold up as a positive about FFXIV, and what the outcome of some of my comments look like.
---
There really is a narrow line between "OMG it's so predictable, I like that" and "OMG it's so predictable, how boring."
---
Honestly I was surprised when it was announced they were losing so many people. Outside the art and story team, since they are constantly making new assets and thus pulling the weight, how many devs actually were freaking working on gw2? NCSoft is trimming the fat and it is long past due
---
Sure, no one did, even though it was an NCSoft-wide thing and didn't affect ANet alone.
---
I know the mount got delayed, but is the balance patch delayed too?
---
Repetitive content can feel worthwhile if you add an exciting skin or such as a reward. If every cool skin is in cash shop, it kind of does take value out of them. That's just how MMO games work.
---
It isn't reasonable to assume that an MMO could produce enough content that's fresh all the time without repetition. You can make that repetition fun possibly though, like grinding a boss encounter or such. However that sort of difficulty level is already in raids, and since there is no real gateway to learn how to play the game properly, it can't really happen I guess.
---
Likewise! &lt;3
---
&gt; If you like playing football you dont stop playing it because maybe in the future the ball might break.
---
Games aren't fungible though. What you have in GW2 isn't something you can find in another game, even if other games of the same broad category exist. Considering on top of that that MMOs are especially demanding in terms of time investment and it's entirely legitimate for people to worry about the long term future of the game.
---
While on one hand what you say is rather true, the difficulty level do reflect the actual amount of new content added. So, what is the value of a count that does not factor it in - what does it reflect? 
---
But you are just missing so much! There are prompts in the game for these things, which I am learning that most folks don't read or discard to quickly. GW2 has the agony system in fractals to continue that upward progression. Someone with full ascended and maxed out AR with stat bonus is noticeably strong than someone without. Most of the prompts come through in game mail to let you know what is open as you open it up. As well as each level you gain, now shows features you have unlocked. Recently playing and leveling a character reminded me of this. 
---
Odd to say that GW2 hurt itself by not doing something traditionally. What is the point in having different games if they are all gonna be the same? I love that I can take a break from GW2, come back and hop right into what is going on. Most other games, I can't play with my friends right off because I need to go replace all the gear I worked hard for. (Which you kind of touched on, so we may agree there) There was some video a while back from Anet about horizontal progression. Once you get your ascended gear and such, you are then striving to get better. 
---
There is something to be said about empty space, it creates mystery and suspense. Maybe you started the story of HoT and find this big red portal while you are exploring... You might ask in map chat (results may vary) and find out its a raid portal/Alternatively you can bump into the portal for it to give you some info as well. Just like any other game out there you might look it up, or learn from someone in game about it. While other systems point out that they are there, it can be much more engaging to find it on your own.  
---
And just curious, because I want to understand your viewpoint better, are you a big player of the game? I am sitting at about 4.5k hours in game, playing since pretty much launch. Wondering if you are a new player, in the middle, or a seasoned person?
---
Last one I saw was on Friday. I've even raided with a dev https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/374287536354230283/533708472383176714/gw948.jpg
---
It's funny, cause part of their ad campaign for the release of GW2 was that you don't have to wait around to have fun.
---
That would be the most ideal outcome but let's not pretend that Anet's past performance means they're guaranteed to capitalize on this opportunity to streamline and focus their activities.
---
They could just as easily fuck it all up or go full paypig mode and give us horribly monetized grind fests. 
---
Reactivating the old Istan and Tarir farms with a newer, even worse, BLC would appease far more people than I care to think about.
---
What I'm still trying to understand is why the playerbase is so infatuated  with the devs who ruined the game. Sure they have given us a beautiful game that is GW2 but after HoT the quality of every patch was diminishing. 
---
Balancing the OP builds taking way too long, PvE content that lasts for a couple hours coming out in several months, raids and fractals also taking too long. In the past 2 years, what even has Anet provided for the WvW players? Like bro, Anet what are you doing each day you come in to work?
---
Maybe these layoffs will cut off the plague that is clearly within the company so that they can grow again and provide the players with content that we deserve. I'm willing to do my part and support the game, but first Anet must redeem themselves and show they are worthy of support. 
---
&gt; In my opinion the best game to compare Guild Wars 2's releases to is ESO. It has an excellent business model that is sustainable for the developers and fair to the players with its optional sub and DLC.
---
One thing to note is ESO's sub includes the material storage, which is a core feature of GW2. I would vastly prefer if ESO's crafting bag was like GW2's system.
---
I also think ESO took crown crates too far. While GW2's BLC exclusives are bad enough, ESO takes it way farther. Crown Crates are usually better value than Black Lion Keys (Crown Crates contain far more and are more generous with the ability to deconstruct unwanted items into currency to buy wanted ones) but the Crown Crates are also pervasive (they hold a greater share over the new cosmetic content for ESO).
---
Overall I think ESO is better monetized, but neither game has a perfect system.
---
I do think there is room for GW2 to add an optional subscription (especially with ESO's design which bundles store currency equal or greater than the sub value in addition to sub features) but any features including in a GW2 sub would need to be completely new and unintrusive. Things like completely unlocking all dyes, access to all undiscovered WPs (something Maplestory 2 does), access to permanent makeovers for free, access to all Living World releases even if you don't own them etc. Things that don't make GW2 players feel cheated for playing without but make having a sub feel good.
---
There are some lessons to be learned from ESO for sure.
---
&gt; By that I mean making raids and fractal (really bringing back dungeons) part of the LW maps and content.
---
It feels like they've tried to do this with some of the stories in Fractals recently, explaining the backstory of the LS happenings... But that's not quite it, I agree.
---
A directly-tied dungeon at the end of a LS episode would be far closer to what FFXIV does, which is basically 1-2 of every 3 dungeons *is* a key part of the story, good or bad.
---
It may be a good way forward, but I doubt it'd happen under the current content strategy.
---
The worry isn't so much about those people finding new jobs - they're competent and have a solid reputation, I'm sure Amazon is already lining them all up - but in how ANet as a whole is losing a lot of talent and experience. Replacing an industry veteran who's been with the company for over a decade with a fresh new face is a risky proposal.
---
300 people is like two times the Blizzard's WoW team. 
---
It's kind of end of work time/most people still at work/getting home?
---
Highly profitable game isn't really true.  NC soft has had a taste of the mobile market.  Their mobile version of lineage made more money than the entire company running in its entire duration in one year.  Guildwars isn't even a visible slice on that pie chart of money anymore.  
---
Yeah for sure. It's a hard line to walk. I think I'd be OK with FFXIV's patch cycle if they stopped taking resources away from dungeons, or put more into the open world. They seem to have siphoned it all to other side content that doesn't appeal to me (Eureka for example).
---
The dungeons have gone from 3 to 2 to 1.5 per patch, and imo they've degraded in quality over the years. Expansion launch dungeons are amazing, but patch dungeons are stale. I'd forgive lack of dungeon content if there were new maps (or even existing maps) to explore. However, FFXIV severely lacks in the open world content department.
---
As an aside, I love your flair.
---
One of the good things that might come of this is the idea that GW2 is the #1 development goal. Before i got the idea people were being shifted to 'new priorities' pretty regularly, hopefully we can keep a dedicated set of people on improving what we have or adding new content. 
---
if the priority is expansions over living story then can we please have a conclusion to the shadowstone sidestory?
---
Standard disclaimer of not an Anet dev, but:
---
Usually when it comes to an individual's work, it won't simply be left unfinished.  Managers will keep track of what projects people are working on.  Any in-progress or pending tasks will be reassigned as needed/prioritized.  Any in-progress code should already be checked in to the relevant source control system.
---
Only caveat would be personal side projects, which may still be handed off to someone else to finish.
---
I know. Which was just as much of a faulty statement as Play Your Way.
---
He mentioned multiple errors to be precise.
---
I'd hope not, but at the same time we've already seen ANet discard entire parts of the game once the team was disbanded or its key members left. SAB is definitely in jeopardy, JPs might be less numerous or less well designed, fractals might be buggier, etc. Not outright gone, just... worse off.
---
I’m not crying, you are
---
Sarah plays GW2? That's awesome... she's fantastic! 
---
I have spent about $0.50 for every hour played of this game. Even if the servers shut off tomorrow, that's still insanely cheap considering all forms of entertainment I could be spending money on. I hope content continues for several years yet, but if it doesn't, it's still worth the money I spent on it.
---
A flawed vector of comparison, frankly. But it's one that just keeps coming up, so it was worth it to actually lay down the numbers on as close to generic terms as I could get.
---
Shoot, I'd like to see some NCSoft layoffs in the midst of all this. Fortunately they saved enough money laying off Arenanet staffers.
---
So much this... as someone who's been playing Guild Wars 1 since Prophecies release... her name is still synonymous with Anet for me. It's going to be really odd not having her there. 
---
&gt; As an aside, I love your flair.
---
I feel like I ought to change it. It's been there since the rework to Guard Staff 1-3 skills (we hardly knew ye, lootstick) but it kind of feels a bit out of place now.
---
So much this.
---
A variety of rewards goes a long way. The fact that there are earnable mounts and armor sets in game is significant for me. And they are paired with new content. I don't have to do an event that came out 5 years ago to get a new weapon skin. And when there is a quest that takes me back to old zones, there's new dialogue and story. I'm not going back to talk to a farmer who is literally still trying to get rid of spiders in her orchard 5 years later.
---
it will be a 3 hour event and if it's not me \[EU\] who keep the tag up after that, i'm sure somebody else will do. &lt;3   
---
Same for BluJasmine i guess.
---
Lol, they couldn't even produce content on time with more staff, now they have less staff. Anet is fucking done.
---
It's not a fair comparison, honestly. Some of the fractals in GW2 are so small you can't really label them as a dungeon. What does "major story update" mean? You can't just put a number to it and call it even as if everyone delivers the same quantity every time. You don't even include things like new races which guild wars 2 obviously never had, not to mention all the content that's completely missing from one game or the other.
---
I agree, it does come off a bit insensitive at this time. However, I just love puns.
---
Can someone elaborate on this a little bit or refer me to a reliable source? I'm new to GW2, but quite familiar with Soule's repertoire. Is he not liked in this community? 
---
I feel you. Lack of information has always been this game's weakest point. I want hype, but I can't get any like this.
---
What money? You aren't paying a subscription fee.
---
MMO's peaked with Wrath of the Lich King in 2008 and have deteriorated somewhat since then in favor of other genres.
---
Mobile is king now, but BRs aren't doing bad either. Fortnite had 10.7 million players attend the Marshmellow concert/event. The next weekend, with no event and with the "exodus" to Apex, Fortnite hit a new (non-event) record of 7.6 million simultaneous players. Fortnite has a total of over 200 million total accounts, which is insane by any standard. Even Apex has about 25 million accounts already. All MMO's combined were never that big.
---
There's so many raid teaching groups / guilds / discords that I'm surprised this is a thing. I can only imagine if you don't have ~2h in a straight sit that raids are difficult to get into.
---
Yeah, I'm part of a team that works on story. Lots of talented people remain at ANet, but we also lost a few good ones in Narrative. We're all rallying behind the scenes to help them find their next home, but it's going to be rough for a bit.
---
A cooperative would be an awful model for game development.
---
Cooperatives are an effective governance structure when risk is low and most of the required capital is backed by physical, recoverable assets.  These two together mean that most of the value of the enterprise can be backed by debt via loans, with only modest equity investments by the co-op founders.  Housing co-ops, for instance, are almost fully funded via mortgage debt, with only a minimal equity down payment, made possible by the value being tied to the physical property inhabited.  Retail co-ops are somewhat more risky, but again most of the value is in retail and warehouse space (rented) and inventory carry (physical goods backed by business loans).  Again, very little residual equity that can be divided between members for modest capital investments.
---
In contrast, game development is both extremely risky and completely unrecoverable as involves virtually no physical assets.  As a result, there is nothing at all to secure with conventional bank loans, and nearly the entire enterprise value needs to be secured by equity investments.  This is the job for deep pocketed venture capital that can float that risk, not for individual employees who do not have six figures of free cash apiece to buy in.
---
Also, the argument that you don't have to be as profitable as a co-op is deeply misleading.  When you have external shareholders, they want to see a competitive return on capital invested.  But if the capital comes from the employees themselves, do they no longer deserve a competitive return on their capital invested?  Why should they settle for less when they could take a job elsewhere and put their capital into an index fund instead?  There are some non-fiduciary benefits to being an employee-owner that can offset return on capital somewhat, but the idea that employee-owners should settle for a low or even zero rate of return on their investment strikes me as deeply problematic.
---
We've got a few. ;)
---
Thank you¬
---
Have you tried doing 2 heal necs, heal rev, heal temp? Literally nobody dies to anything but one shot mechanics (like spikes on MO).
---
For me it's expansions or bust. I want new spells and new builds, hopefully also a new class this time. Without all that, GW2 gets way too stale.
---
They affect visibility, and don't let players see there's many others with the same problems.
---
But what if these long term employees have skills that cannot be easily replaced? What about the long term direction of that company? 
---
Treating humans like replaceable parts often leads to less performance, not more of it. Which is why I prefer my country's employment law to that of the US.
---
Then again, Arenanet had 400 employees, everyting indicated they were going to diversify, which is okay in my book and follows common sense, that you may want to have other games eventually, maybe rebuild the engine, or run a few successful spinoffs. Nothing too outlandish, considering GoodGame studios in Hamburg had over 1000, before they had to cut back their bloat, InnoGames, their competitor, has some 500 employees, but these guys make games that certainly don't take as much effort as GW2 does.
---
Ultimately, I interpret this as NC-Soft trying to limit Anet's long term success, maybe out of fear that Arenanet could buy back the majority of its shares and thus its independence in the future. 
---
&gt;Sounds like argument from authority to me. My opinion isn't valid unless I pull out some diplomas or what?
---
Diplomas are one way to show experience, and experience is one way to support your point with evidence. In the best of times, saying "I know better than the professionals" without any evidence to back that up is some Monday morning quarterback bullshit. 
---
Doing it after a hundred people lost their jobs completely unexpectedly is just callous, on top of being a poor argument. 
---
Anet needs both a profitable game and a new game. If they werent siphoning so much from gw2 people wouldn't mind. Most people understand or would even support Anet working on something new. 
---
If they werent working on multiple new games it would be fine, one large profitable game and one in development is a good split of resources. Like it or not GW2 requires a huge amount of resources to keep it profitable which is important for future development.
---
If -any- of those projects they were working on were either close to completion or showed a hint of promise I'm sure NCSoft would have supported Anet as would the players.
---
Lets call a spade a spade. Anet was deliberately making GW2 less profitable with their nonsense while also working on multiple projects that were apparently going nowhere.
---
That Tower of Nightmares was SO fucking fun. One of the most "open world" fun things to be had in this game.
---
That's freaking awesome. I swear, some people have more energy than the sun.
---
&gt; we will not be making any mega-threads with regards to developers  leaving. This is a sad time and we want each person who is leaving to  have the dignity of having their own post 
---
one thing doesnt deny the other. i'd love to see a mega-thread, with links to each post.
---
Ever heard of this thing called the "gem store"?
---
Based on the list, I would say GW2 falls just about where I expected.
---
I know the community is in a state of panic and internet fans will always be demanding, but ArenaNet has never been afraid to do things their own way.
---
The methods have changed over the years, but in essence, attempting to break the mold is what made GW2 so popular in the first place.
---
Also keep in mind that Square Enix and Blizzard were very well established before GW2 was even announced. So against all of that, I would say absolutely GW2 is keeping up with the standard set by this industry. There is a difference in content focus, but that is to be expected.
---
Can vouch that FFXIV trashes GW2 when it comes to raid content, even midcore content.
---
Theres already a very large number of senior staff / team leaders being let go, and afaik then theres only 2-3 top "managers" left. Both Mikes and someone for marketing. Thats as flat as it gets tbh. You'd have to look at NCSoft for "higher ups".
---
Love these armor sets, if you don't mind me asking what are the armors you're using for the 3rd from the right in the middle row, both the 2nd from the left and the 3rd from the right in the bottom row? Huge thanks in advance
---
I see people say they have a hard time running it especially cyrodill - but I'm impressed with how good it looks and exactly how much can be on my screen at once before I'm under 60fps. I'm just running an i7 6700k factory no over clocking. Meanwhile GW2 is sub 40 fps in amnoon and most heavily populated new zones and capital cities... It's very playable but takes a fair amount of my enjoyment out of it... 
---
When GW2 launched I had an amd fx8350 and oh boy was that not fun, even in the most desolate of zones it was at 40 fps regardless of graphical settings.
---
Seems worth sharing since everything we seem to know suggests he was just as worried as the rest of the company. This seems silly - if they want to fire anyone responsible, why not chase down NCSoft?
---
Thankyou for the insight. There was no doubt to me MO would do it this way.
---
Again: Condolences and Love towards the entire team.
---
#Love4ArenaNet 
---
Without any context this just feels super rude.
---
Hmm, that sounds reasonable and cool. I like it! Thinking about it, this could also play out great by combining it with map- or other currency to provide some more specific loot that just some blues and green with a higher chance of seeing them than the rare item has.
---
I mean what did you not like about the raids? What more were you looking for?
---
MO is a glorified DPS golem with somebody good on Claim and Dispel. However, in my opinion, MO actually becomes one of the hardest bosses to play properly with people who don't know what they're doing, and learning/teaching it can be interesting. If you were with a good group though, then yeah, it's basically a DPS golem that you occasionally move for.
---
Gorse is another one that the main mechanic gets skipped on. With a good group, it's mostly stand in the center in DPS. 
---
Not liking VG is interesting. I find that fight to be straightforward, but still pretty engaging. It's got a good amount of mechanics that all players have to do, so the individual responsibility is higher. It's definitely an easy boss, but, he's got some depth to him.
---
&gt; attempting to break the mold is what made GW2 so popular in the first place.
---
Absolutely. It's a highly approachable game with a great history, unique storytelling, and loads of value.
---
The experimentation... Had mixed outcomes. I think if they had begun where they are now, we'd be in a better place, but I doubt we could have arrived here without some of the early missteps.
---
&gt; I would say absolutely GW2 is keeping up with the standard set by this industry. There is a difference in content focus, but that is to be expected.
---
Yes. A very important point, and I agree.
---
Gonna be honest, GW2 is more weeby at this point than FFXIV.
---
As an MMO ages and the influx of new players dwindles, the continuing health of the playerbase depends on retention of existing players.  Raids (and to a lesser extent, fractals) may not be universally popular, but they are some of the longest-lasting repeatable content that the game has to offer.  You benefit from that even if you never set foot in instanced content.
---
It's easy to see raids and the community around them as a net negative when your only experience is seeing the loudest and most obnoxious members.  What you're not seeing, though, are the guilds and small groups who never show up on the LFG tool, but are still around the other parts of the game because raids and fractals give them a reason to keep logging in.
---
You may not notice their presence, but you will notice their absence.
---
Did they force you to buy gems?
---
Sure, that's absolutely a valid stance to take, but a lot of people won't necessarily make friends they'd play other games with. For a lot of players, myself included, the game's only worth is in its experiences (i.e. the intrinsic fun of play) and the material value your characters accumulate over time, e.g. achievements, armor, collectibles, etc. For those players, continuing to play a game whose future is uncertain makes little sense.
---
Also, there are people for whom investing in a car or bike is less interesting than investing in a virtual world where they can be someone else without their woes, flaws and concerns.
---
If the view is that these layoffs were due to the studio failing to complete projects, then it was MO's responsibility. It does seem remiss to not direct it at NCSoft though.
---
**What.** I've not even read it but from the title alone it sounds stupid and random on so many levels. 
---
If it wasn't for MO there wouldn't even be a GW1 let alone GW2. What is this shit exactly? Just some wannabe mob? 
---
&gt; ..Trials...
---
I think they're similar enough to the 8-man raids to be counted as such. The Hard+Extreme difficulties that Trials use is analagous to the Normal+Savage difficulties the 8-mans use, and both are essentially a single boss fight in an arena.
---
Both metrics would exclude wierd trials like Rathalos. Which is fine.
---
Not sure if I would call Gaile a developer, as the article suggests
---
&gt; The fact that DPS rotations exist is a testament to poor game design,  not an innovative community 
---
The rest of this paragraph I liked, but this is straight up bs.  
---
DPS rotations will always exist, because a DPS rotation is the highest damage you get out of your class, the only way it can not exist is by making all skills do the exact same damage, which would suck ass for everyone in every game mode.
---
&gt; it means the skills have so little impact  that it's more important to press the buttons in a certain order than it  is to know what the skills are, how they work and interact, and most  importantly how to treat them as a toolset.
---
This is so misguided I can't really understand where you are going with this, are you implying that people in raids stick to their rotation whatsoever and don't use any out-of-rotation cooldowns even if it would be more helpful ? Or are you implying that stacking in a point and unloading your rotation is more efficient than keeping in mind what's going on around you ?  
---
Tbh from someone that has played a lot of GW1 (build sets were mostly just like rotations from gw2), I can tell you that people who just "press buttons in X order" are terrible people you would never want to group up with. Rotations are a GUIDE on how to achieve max DPS, if you have no idea what your skills do and follow your rotation perfectly, you will probably just end up fucking the run up, for you and everyone else involved, then go on reddit and complain about "muh meta raid elitist unrealistic expectations". 
---
Maximizing DPS can also be a case of situational awareness "oh this mechanic ends if we deal 10% damage, I'll hit harder instead of blowing all my defensive cooldowns to tank it"
---
&gt;DPS rotations treat skills  as number generators, not tools - and when you boil them down, most  skills in this game are merely number generators. 
---
Why would all skills need to do something outside of damage ? That's why you have utilities AND weapon skills, you'll almost always have utility loaded (Basilisk venom on thieves, Banners on warriors, spotter on Ranger) but you'll have some skills that actually straight up deal damage and that's A GOOD THING. I mean, if people want a challenge they can pick something with difficulty built-in and a toolboxy skillset (rev, engi), but some people just like dealing damage (Daredevils, Weavers) with a bit of utility thrown in to feel like you're helping others aswell. Wanting all skills to have additional utility is as stupid as wanting all skills to be about raw damage.
---
I think that's what happened.  NCSoft came in and told them to focus on their cash cow and stop developing new projects.  For the time being I think it will be good for the game, but the future of Anet may be in peril.
---
Thanks for all the responses everyone. I’m gonna dive in head first. I think I’m just salty from all the time I’ve dumped into wow and it’s just not satisfying me anymore so I was hesitant to jump back in to another mmo but I’m def liking parts of this game. 
---
That'll make comparing expansions harder, but since they're all named DLC maybe I'll just exclude that and put in a disclaimer...
---
Interesting strategy though.
---
The industry seriously needs to unionize and fast. While I don't agree with how they are going about this it is completely unfair to put the entirety of the blame for this situation on just NCSOFT. The heads of ANET put these people on other projects. A dev himself said the focus of ANET recently has not been towards GW2 up until the mass layoffs. 
---
Don't get me wrong, NCSOFT is trash but the management at ANET pulling people into other projects at the cost of gimping their one and only game creating profit/revenue is equally as trash &amp; pretty damn stupid. These workers were laid off because of decisions their bosses made which lead to their bosses' bosses stepping in. 
---
They want NCSoft to fire the last founder of Arenanet are they morons. They do that and GW2 will die. At least the GW2 community has more sense than this.
---
So I can punch someone as long as I throw some loose change at them afterward? Good to know. Lay-offs happen, but I highly doubt this was a quick decision for NCSoft so they could very easily have given the company some warning.
---
nope
---
Well GW2 yes I agree but GW1 was a project by all 3 founders.
---
I just don't know how living world is supposed to compete with the level of content generated by other games currently while still staying true its current design. I want episode releases  every two months with updates to include expansion-like content like new elite specs, craftable cosmetics, and masteries that are actually game changing. But gw2 is already dated and another expac would probably even have problems reviving revenue. I just hope we get some kind of end of life update that at least builds a servicable endgame that can be repeated for fans but I doubt it will come.
---
Gaile is an Arenanet legend like everyone who was laid off.
---
Meh, I was hoping for some hot scoop, like a disgruntled former employee... Common trolls are dime a dozen.
---
Yes physically assaulting someone and laying someone off are the same thing.
---
Yeah but still, he is a Massive pillar!!
---
I am 100% positive higher ups at anet knew about what's going to happen.
---
I am really sad for both who lost their jobs and the people who could keep their jobs but I hope you could use this as a motivation to show the world how great of a team you are and make your former colleagues proud!
---
More like profiteering. There is a difference.
---
But it could have been Mike who pushed to work on these other projects that led to GW2's neglect.
---
The stat swap is really great, I made Dire gear and swapped it all to Vipers this way.
---
Sure he probably shares in the blame. That said, do we really want ncsoft choosing his replacement. At least Mo cares. That's more important to me right now.
---
I agree completely.  Big Daddy wants their profits and Anet got taken to the wood shed.  I think it will be good for the game, but long term for Anet might be less so.
---
Not saying he wasn't but we need to the other founders some credit for coming up with the idea of GW1.
---
You"re speaking about two different problems, you're feeling bad because of your disability if you need to execute on ele for a long time, a class that is KNOWN FOR intensive apm when executing rotations... What about trying on another profession first then ? Daredevil has decent DPS and has the simplest rotation I can think of, maybe that's the issue over the "sustained dps" one
---
Easy mode raids I won't argue with, they'd probably be great
---
but didnt have anything to do with game development...
---
But she's not a dev. Never was.
---
i understand alot of what you are saying in this post... however... 
---
you are making quite alot of claims about the affected people in your post, without any source (from what i see), which is just ..... assuming
---
and we all know how media thinks about "assumptions"
---
&gt; They do that and GW2 will die
---
why?
---
The most important take from your table is that GW2 has very little instanced content, yet those bring the most replayability and retain players because of long time goals (CMs, LIs, Legendary Armors...).
---
* 6 fractals in 4 years, no new dungeon despite the huge potential with each new map, new lore, new story instances. The average for the two other MMOs is 28.
---
* 6 raid *wings*, not *full raids*, with 22 encounters, 1/4 of those being meaningless events and not actual bosses. The average for the two other MMOs is 59.
---
It's very apparent that GW2 is becoming more and more a "one-trick" MMO with all the resources being funneled into creating more and more maps that nobody asked for instead of balancing the resources to diversify the releases.
---
In my humble opinion of rando asshat on the internet, that is the main reason for the downfall of GW2 over the past 2-3 years. I'm fairly certain a better balance could be found to sustain more game modes than just Living Story as it is right now, with half as many maps but instead new dungeons tied to these new maps, new skins to give an incentive to play the game once you're done with the 2 hours of story, bigger dungeons/fractals/raids team(s), and obviously sPvP/WvW attention. 
---
The current state of releases is targeted at casual players and only casual players, logging in for the occasional Living Story episode then gone for 3 months playing other games. The lack of effort to retain the more invested and faithful players that love and play this game the most is disheartening. And I can imagine the incentive to please said players is fairly low because the more you play the more likely you are to convert gold to gems instead of swiping your credit card at every new outfit, but isn't playing and keeping the game alive just as important of a support to GW2? 
---
The Campaigns were not expansions. Close to, but no. You're brought to a brand new giant region with roughly 25+zones (Campaign), new professions and old which you can start at lvl 1 and play throughout the entire region or bring an old character to help defeat what is going on. Then they added new elite zones etc. All with replayability and beautiful rewards. That is a brand new game. Not an expansion. All we get now is 5 new maps and new story with a major feature(mounts, elite specs) which in reality isn't really much. 
---
1 thing i kinda wish was for them to bring Hard mode and Vanquishing. That was fun and rewarding. 
---
Good comparison, on a site note, FFXIV will have another expansion in July 2019.
---
&gt;ncsoft did nothing wrong
---
GW2's version of Thanos did nothing wrong version of The Empire did nothing wrong?
---
Since you have PoF, you have access to the Soulbeast Elite Spec. If you're wanting something meta, I'd go a Condition Shortbow Ranger leading up to Soulbeast at 80, and get a feel for that.
---
Just note that Soulbeast's mechanic is to merge with their pet, inheriting a set of three new skills on the F keys and a good stat increase, but at the cost of not having your pet out on the field. Which is fine, you can merge and unmerge at will for the most part, cooldowns being a consideration.
---
Once you get a better feel for the builds, switching between them will become a lot more natural. Also note that your build preference is unique between modes. If you have X utility in PvE because it's helpful there, but it's less helpful in WvW, you can replace it with Y utility in WvW without your PvE utilities being altered when you head out.
---
If you're intent on Longbow and pet, I might suggest eventually getting Heart of Thorns expansion for the Druid Elite Spec. I run a Staff and Longbow Druid Sylvari, and Dagger/Dagger and Short Bow Soulbeast Human. I think you're going to love the class
---
i think some colleges said on discord that he would stay 
---
no, that's Joko did nothing wrong
---
Glad to see you're too stupid to understand.  
---
And of course you're gonna use the "i used to work on game development!!" excuse, yet i still don't see your idea, just your ranting and bitching.
---
&gt; We don't even need a roadmap, just some kind of confirmation that there will still be new content coming and we're not just heading to maintenance mode.
---
I agree with everything you said except this.
---
This kind of generic "confirmation that there will still be new content" is what I'm expecting when they finally do make a statement. That's not enough to convince me. They could do pretty much anything and fulfill that commitment.
---
I just build a new PC to play this game! Nothing is going to stop me! 
---
I don't have an issue with the maps therefore I don't have any complaints about them. That means I don't need anything fixed on them. However if I was the person in charge of fixing them, I'd want something more specific than "THIS SUCKS!!!" to work with.
---
So let's say for example, what is the #1 thing about the latest map for Thunderhead Keep makes you not want to play in it?
---
ripperoni
---
Probably down votes incoming but the lack of responsibility placed on Mike O'Brien when discussing the recent layoffs seems odd. It would have been his decision to create a publishing division in 2015 (which was quite useless as no new games were being published) and the failing mobile projects running since at least 2013 were also on his watch. Same with any other side projects that led to no results but, and we have confirmation, were draining resources from Guild Wars 2 - Arenanet's major, by far, revenue source. 
---
What happens with Arenanet absolutely sucks but it sucks due to what appears to be mismanagement. While removing him may not be the best strategy, a statement clarifying his previous position and what has now changed with respect for the game (more focus, a road map, whatever) needs to be made.
---
The thing that's been keeping me playing is the thought of maybe they will wake up and let Josh Finnish SAB oneday, SAB being the only content left that I really enjoy, now I know that will never happen and im thinking about uninstalling. It's not the number of people let go that concerns, it's the quality of those people.
---
Some of the well known devs are people who joined GW2 after launch. There is a change of guard but it's an opportunity to appreciate the work of the people stepping into new roles or becoming more visible in old ones.
---
This kind of thing has always been happening at ArenaNet, just not at this scale, new people stepped into their shoes and have built great things on the work that was done before them. That is the pathway forward from here as well.
---
Source? Link? Screen cap?
---
It is an awful analogy. 
---
To each their own. I think ESO really knocks it out of the park with their content releases, and this is coming from an MMO vet.  
---
I play the ESO "micromaps" a hell of a lot longer than I play the LW maps released in GW2. The size may be smaller, but the amount of content is FAR more vast. Hell why hasn't GW2 ripped off the arena idea of Dragonstar/Blackrose Prison (the new PvE arena that was just released in the last "micromap")?  
---
I find every quest in ESO to be much more engaging than the events in GW2. Even if they are not repeatable, there are literally hundreds of them. I firmly believe World Completion in ESO takes much longer than World Completion in GW2.  
---
Finally, you get access to all of the DLC with a subscription AND 1650 crowns per month. The monthly crowns allow you to buy all of the DLC that goes on sale for as low as 500 crowns, so that you can play them even without a subscription... I find it's truly a well thought out system for both developer and consumer. And I have no idea what you're referring to with cosmetics locked behind real money, are you confusing ESO with Guild Wars 2? Just about all cosmetics are unlockable with in game gold via motifs, did you not know that? O.o  
---
P.S. One final point: ESO releases fully fleshed out interesting dungeons, the closest GW2 has is fractals which come out less frequently than ESO's dungeons.
---
I usually buy a small handful of gems at the start-ish of a month, or sometimes, if there’s something I really really want (looking at you, Shrine Guardian). I’ll probably keep doing that, but $50 is a bit much for me.
---
How do we know this was without warning?
---
&gt; The Nightmare Court is unrelated to Mordremoth.
---
I wasn't saying they were. Just that they were right about the tablet.
---
Yes every online game.
---
does he have reddit ore similar?
---
Why not both?
---
Do it. Extra points for editions in different languages.
---
But muh veteran game devs
---
Raymond Lukes and the potted plant seem to still be there D;
---
It's a very nobel action, indeed.
---
But it won't work, if NCsoft says "fire people and cut these projects". It's not like Mike O'Brien had a choice.
---
We could have both, but I despise sailing in games. Otherwise great games for me have been ruined by it (i.e. Wind Waker, Black Flag)
---
Yeah, since they're rolled into one package
---
&gt; yet I still have to hear any good ideas to make it better.
---
Rewards.
---
It's that simple.
---
There's a reason people show up to do the chak garrent and shatterer 2.0 but generally don't care too much about the Verdant Brink meta.
---
Unique skins and things like rare auras will keep people engaged. Requiring some kind of lead up tot the main event keeps people on the map for more than 10 minutes every 2 hours.
---
It's not a good idea to focus on this as the main game content, but it's a proven way to keep non-leveling overworld maps populated.
---
Even then you would survive...I'd be up for the challenge.
---
Thanks so much.  All the outpouring of appreciations is staggering and more than I deserve.  I appreciate it. 
---
Dang he has Shining Blade, the family line is looking pretty sweet at this point lol
---
Sorry, but the dragon won and we lost. Why did you expect something after it?
---
Simple.
---
 go back to the living world with regular updates . Epic events and festival like the invasion of the Karka , Marrionette  ,The destruction of Iion arch etc 
---
Personally , I’m bored of the living story . Never liked them . Would rather spend my time playing proper story based RPG like The Witcher ,bloodbourne etc .Better the resources is spent on community based event than instances people will never go back to after completion . 
---
 I am not saying that the living story be abandoned for those who love it but not at the expense ( which was what happened ) of the huge community based events. 
---
If fact , for a start , they can upscale those cursed shore  bosses for a month ,build quest around them ,make them painful and give rewards to reflect achievements 
---
We need more dungeons .A lot of them . Painful rewarding dungeons but just a bit less painful  than raid .
---
More raid for those who love raiding .
---
Fun map with replayability like Heart of thorns map . 
---
Consolidation of currencies . There are too many currencies in the game .Develop a currency exchange market where currencies earned on one map  can be exchanged with currency from another map
---
Stop by breaking builds . 
---
Vanilla Trait should be different based on the specialisation chosen . 
---
Balance should be done based on specialisation and not on vanilla . 
---
E.g If someone chooses to be a Druid , tabs like marksmanship , nature magic and survival  should different for the same trait to reflect the choice . 
---
That way , the traits and their effects on say Marksmanship on a Druid specialisation will be different from vanilla or soul beast 
---
Let say soften the fall or moment of clarity last for 5 seconds on a vanilla . For Druid or soul beast , it might maybe 2 . 
---
Bosses who look like bosses and not walking plants or zoo animals. Proper ugly looking , evil bosses who move around , cast spells,and spread damaging conditions  like those cursed shore champion when they are upscaled . 
---
Crafting 
---
A market should be created for items produced when crafting . A lot of crafted items are useless and only useful for salvaging. 
---
The item produced when players are levelling crafting should form a core of what is needed for legendary crafting or other future weapon ,armour ,amulet,ring ,back back  releases .
---
No more new currencies or new material. 
---
Dragon bash was amazing.  I wish we could have done it one more time.

Add more skins (shiney stuff too) and outfits every 2 weeks and do a daily Rotation and ppl will throw their credit cards at anet.... Fortnite and others are making in 1 month more with that system than GW2 within a year ...
---
The layoffs damaged Anet's reputation along with NC, but they didn't have much of a good rep to begin with. Regardless of who caused the damage, it'll ultimately come down to Anet to fix their own reputation. 
---
That's looks like a healthy lifespan for a game.  Numerically, It's certainly not outstanding when compared to industry blockbusters like GTA V and CoD.
---
If the focus of this post was the data's declining trend, I'm not sure why this would be considered "alarming." Every game will have declining sales figures, dlc may remedy this in the short term but eventually; yes a game will start to "fail" or "die."
---
Even if this game is "dying" (I don't believe this to be the case at all,) it should be primed for a sequel. Nothing about this data reads as "unsuccessful," especially since it's unclear if it encompasses all digital purchases (gems.)
---
So the latest thing we have from Anet is before they started doing all of the lay offs. Got it. No need for clarification since then, nope. Not at all.
---
They might still be commited to LS5, but we don't know how much of the work for that is already done or if they have anything planned beyond that.
---
it really doesn't. if this were the first sign of trouble then that *might* be true, but the cracks have been showing for over a year now, all this did was confirm peoples fears in regards to the game.
---

---
I think you’re off with your count for the number of zones for FFXIV, each expansion added 6. Then there’s also Eureka… but let’s not talk about that. 
---
This is why early liberals have argued against the publicly traded model. It breeds a class of people, who gain from the company without investing any work into it. This leads to neglect and to investors, who know nothing about industry and are the least capable of making a management decision, but somehow end up having the ultimate control over management. In a private company, it is often the founder who is owner and CEO in personal union (or his heir in older companies). Since he's invested in his company, he's going to build it up.
---
Now NC-Soft is owned by its CEO (12%), the Republic of Korea's National Pension Service (11.7%) and another Korean publisher called Netmarble Games (8.9%). The rest (67.4%) is held by the anonymous market.
---
If only I could get an ownership overview of Arenanet. I suspect that its three founders each held 33% and the last remaining founder holds somewhere between 33% and 49%. If Arenanet could be bought out of the NC-Soft corporation, it could at least make its own long term decisions.
---
I mean, I will keep it simple and reference this 
---
 "make sure you're making the most of your cooldown and pressing all the buttons that light up and don't let dots fall off."
---
This comment does not signify "raided both at high level" to me, because that is a gross downplay of most classes in WoW even now in BFA. 
---
I could say that FF14 is just "press the buttons every few seconds that maintain your stuff" in reference to how easy it is, but that would be just as unfair. 
---
Keep in mind, you also tend to get MUCH more haste in WoW so GCD often goes even below 1s. This is with many classes not ever using the same ability twice, so you actually are reacting quickly AND making decisions. 
---
The point I was trying to make is that you don't just hit every ability that lights up. There are tons of procs and numbers and things going on in the background that will make you change that priority that if you are ignoring any one of them to focus on the encounter as well, your dps will show it. 
---
You're basically allowed to verbally abuse people on the forums if you do it in defense of Anet.
---
&gt; long overdue projects they literally wasted money on (because no release means no revenue)
---
Source? Last we know it was just "projects"
---
I swear you are the Liquid Perfection guy they banned yesterday. Account creation day plus your way of argumentation (empty arguments) fits like a shoe. Stirr your drama somewhere else
---
I've advertised about this since the morning in Dragon Stand and Ley-Line Anomalies event ;)  
---
We'll have people. &lt;3  
---
[What is promised is promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/auudcy/a_celebration_of_those_weve_lost_today/ehb8bip/?context=3)  
---
Are you counting cities or endgame hubs? Because I ignored those in WoW as well.
---
WoW does not have content patches every 77 days.
---
Yikes! That's really intense lightning.
---
I 100% agree with you. I'm in the same boat. I can't be arsed to even log in anymore until this is clarified. 
---
I'll take a look when I'm back from work :D
---
&gt; Yeah no. Josh left. Now we're left to assume there will NEVER be a new jp, 
---
The JP on Siren's Landing wasn't built by Josh. Other JPs in the game weren't built by Josh. This is just hyperbole. Josh is a great dev and he made some of the best JPs in the game, but he isn't the only one who makes JPs. It's also possible for other devs to fill his shoes and come up with something cool for us.
---
Personally I think JPs have been an undervalued concept for years now anyway - the core game was full of them, HoT, PoF and Living World maps barely contain any.
---
Fair point about me oversimplifying WoW's rotations, you're right there.
---
But at the end of the day, the average complexity of the rotation/priority system for each DPS class in FF14 is much more complex than WoW's. The trade-off is that GCDs are slower in FF14. It has to be, or either game would be impossible to play without lightning fast fingers.
---
I stopped playing in Legion, but didn't they remove most positional bonuses for melee abilities from WoW, with the exception of Backstab and a handful of other spells? All of the FF14 melee classes have abilities that require you to transition between striking enemies from the sides OR rear to maintain DPS, while having no less positioning requirements for mechanics than in WoW. Put another way, basic combos REQUIRE constant movement and positioning around the boss's position - that's a layer of complexity for every melee DPS class that WoW only has with rogues off the top of my head.
---
People also always bring up the "hurhur why would they hold your hand back in my day games didnt tell you shit" bullshit.
---
probably.. i mean.. how many retarted people with a personal hate against anet come to your mind?
---
Ultimate is in the raid list, yeah - Trials I left out specifically, but may add later.
---
I am sorry but this is utterly bs and this people do not realise they hurt the game more and us players then anything else. So you want to fire Mike? And then he have a new job in a few day but we are still here with a game we want to play and stay alive. You think anyone can fill those shoes from the outside better then Mike? 
---
Get the hell out of here!
---
You compare things that are incompatible. Like WoW and it's not even in it's prime anymore.
---
Oh, that is DARK.  &gt;.&lt;
---
Considering the news of the lack of focus, we may actually get one now.

And boats. And fishing. And fishing on boats. And fishing on skimmers. And fishing on skimmers while on a boat.

They didn't want Canthan themes within a western city.

&gt;Go back to the living world with regular updates 
---
Looking at the updates over the past couple of years, it seems highly regular (almost the exact same release dates as FFXIV which is heralded as the most regularly and predictably patched mmorpg). For reference, here are the dates:
---
releases are:  
---
Nov 28 2017  
---
March 6 2018  
---
June 26 2018

FFXIV comparatively had (which is often touted as having consistent and frequent patches)

Definitely.  I love this game to death but seeing it this way over the last year has been pretty rough.  Now, I don't even want to login because what am I gonna do?  Do some hearts or map completion in PvE?  No thanks.
---
&gt; But GW2 didn't evolve in that direction
---
Come to think of it, that single sentence sums up much of my frustration with GW2 since release better than anything else.
---
GW2, at release **had sooooo much potential**. More than any other MMO at release. It had fresh ideas, it wasn't afraid to try crazy things such as the story actually happening with or without the player there, it shed much of the cruft other games accrued and it dug out a few ideas which just didn't get the spotlight they needed before like RvR.
---
But... nothing ever truly game of it. The anemic and glacial post-release development had highs and lows, but the highs were centered around adding **even more** "has potential"-elements to it, like Guild Halls, gliding, mounts, raids, SAB, randomized-layout dungeons, etc etc. And again, instead of realizing that potential afterwards, truly unfolding a great design from a great idea, they instead forgot about it, did nothing for months, then pushing in another unfinished idea which could be great in the future.
---
Come to think of it... that sounds like the Google of game design, actually. And they have that problem supposedly because of the management issues  they have coupled with how their teams work, everyone wants to "leave their mark" before they're out the door so instead of fixing up existing things, everyone adds something new **they made** instead. :(
---
Case in point: Bosch has remained a private company and has an odd voting structure: Most of the company (91.99%) is held by the Robert Bosch foundation. The foundation has no voting rights. The Bosch family holds 8% of the stock and 7% of the voting rights. The Bosch Treuhand KG, which consists of former Bosch executives, employees and industry people holds 93% of voting rights and owns (0.01%) of the company.
---
This ensures profits are reinvested back into the company and that the company cannot be sold out. I'm not sure about the legality of this in the US, but in Germany making your company unbuyable via foundation is legal. If we fans were able to raise the funds, we could do the same thing with Arenanet.
---
Aight yea i get it if you are looking at the game  from the point of view that it is a diploma/checklist/accomplishment on your wall instead of as an activity or as you said the intrinsic fun of it. You might be concerned that the diploma might not exist in "x amount of time".  Then sure i guess i get why you would be concerned. 
---
and just to clarify i didnt want to sound judgmental if thats how someone sees the game. If you are happy with that way of viewing/playing the game then go nuts, its no skin of my back!
---
I am not calling ncsoft good guy. But they are not bad either. They are a business. And business is about profit. Anet also is about profit. Since Anet couldn't bring profit with cancelled projects, they had to step in.
---
honestly, I'd love it if they added some boats, with the option to fish off them.
---
Give me a little dinghy and a fishing rod, a decent fishing minigame, and GW2 is revived for another 5 years for me.
---
Do you have a count that's better which I could credit and adjust the post?
---
This was done based on readings of the patch notes, which are formatted in a way I struggled with.
---
You're thinking far too deeply about why or why not it might interest me.
---
I have only played PvP in GW2 for the past 2 years when I logged in, dabbling heavily into it beforehand also. If it was literally only a PvP game I would be more than happy. It really is that simple for me.
---
Learn punctuation, then come back.
---
It may actually be the best time, since they have shifted all of their focus to it.
---
People get laid off all the time in the world. It’s just a fact of life. Doesn’t mean there needs to be a union. I don’t see any evidence of these workers being mistreated. They’re all getting at least a couple months paid salary &amp; were likely well-compensated while employed.
---
Unions have drawbacks. They can introduce corruption, like getting kickbacks from politicians they help get elected, making a continuous cycle. And making life difficult for workers that don’t choose to join their union. Especially public-sector unions, whose members are essentially employed by taxpayers.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/03/02/public-sector_unions_deserve_to_be_destroyed_136413.amp.html
---
If you have more accurate counts I'd love them - the misrepresentation wasn't intentional, I struggled reading the documentation.
---
I think NCsoft just wants more control over what projects money is being spent on. Maybe they will fund projects for Arenanet in the future with more direct say in what kind of project it is.
---
Quiet literally every one of those sections has misinformation about each of those games. You clearly don't play all three and you clearly didn't look into any details pertaining to content releases. What a joke.
---
I am definitely for it, if it's an optional thing (as most things tend to be). I'd just hate for it to be forced for map &amp; story progression (i.e. mounts/gliding)
---
Last night we have introduced him to Vaporwave.
---
I hope it goes well alongside his sculptures. 
---
I literally have 6€. 
---
Being good person doesn't qualify you as good manager.
---
Coming into them as a raid noob, it was surprisingly easy to get into Omega and Ivalice; gearing is simple (since there's only one set per class, give or take), and once you get your head wrapped around using the various post-70 tracks to climb the ilvls, not too painful. The fights are complex (AoEs and mechanics like Great Hall turned up, except even with a couple dozen people all firing off spells, you can see what's going on and your skills fire on schedule) but learnable (except for the Math dude in the Lighthouse; F that mech). Still need to try Bahamut and Alexander once I finish the (base) others.
---
Yeah, that's what we need... even more uncertainty.... 
---
I was trying to line up the details with the way the developers communicate than more than anything.
---
The same can be said with FFXIV - there's really only one raid per expansion, with 3 wings each, but does that detail help communicate the content volumes properly?
---
I have no interest in Raid content and I absolutely hated the legendary medium design to the point I felt trolled, and disliked his reasoning behind the buttcape debacle because it made no sense. Woulda preferred they stuck with dungeons instead of going that cliche direction. GW2 was supposed to be anti-cliche and do things differently than other MMOs.
---
Definitely true, but to say you can't enter without kp / li isn't. LFG is still plentiful on peak hours for those type of fuck around / teaching groups as well.
---
So I'm trying to practice the Condi Renegade rotation, the one on Metabattle for the fractals build is super long and hard to follow. I remember reading in a previous question thread that there's an easier rotation for small hitboxes that's used even on large hitboxes. Should I use that instead? Also when practicing in the aerodrome target golem area, should I set any boons on (mainly alacrity and quickness since those can affect rotation)?
---
It think you're making the same point they are.
---
&gt;  or build one or two large maps like how Dry Top and Silverwaste built over time.
---
&gt; So many GW2 gamers have been defending the idea of Living World season over Expansions.
---
Do they just... not remember anything that happened before HoT?
---
Is something , wrong with the punctuation. presented in the post . above ?
---
This is beautiful. This game saved my life as well. It is a story I am still not ready to tell, but GW2 and ANet are directly attributed to me being here now.
---
&gt; For one, the number of senior leadership let go. Yeah, that's normal. Companies see labor as a cost and not a productive asset, I get that.
---
Or they were offered a financial parachute in the form of a voluntary redundancy and someone who had been working there for 10+ years saw it as a good opportunity to bow out and try something new with their life, with a nice little financial buffer to help them along the way.
---
&gt; Two, we don't know that they're working on other projects. But here's the thing. "Guild Wars 2 will not be affected but with fewer developers working on it." The final sentence of that article. I have very little reason to believe that we will see volume and quality of content improve if that is true.
---
That't not a quote from ArenaNet and it's not sourced to anyone. It's new information and it's not sourced - to me that's bad journalism. Either she made it up (or conflated ArenaNet will have fewer people working for them with Guild Wars 2 will have fewer people working on it - that's two different things) or she has been given that information from someone and has not sourced it in her story (which is also a mistake - you have to source new information in a news story).
---
&gt; Three, we have no idea what the future holds beyond season 5. We have no insight into the plans for this game.
---
That was true before the layoffs and it's been true several times in the past. The sky didn't fall then. I do agree though that in the coming months ArenaNet should clarify the future of GW2 - using inconsistent terms like Seasons (which have delivered a different quantity, quality and type of content over the years) "with features usually reserved for an expansion" is too vague in this context. Basically I think it's announce an expansion is in the works (the only detail needed is that one is in the works, no other details necessary) or bust.
---
Some people need that treadmill to keep them going and I totally respect that.
---
I diversify my play time between WvW (zerg, roam), sPvP, and PvE (open world, fractals, raids) so I feel like I always have plenty to do. My long term goals in this game are mostly wealth-based like crafting legendaries, collecting new skins, converting gold-&gt;gems to unlock more account upgrades like character slots, bag expansions, or gem store cosmetics. I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what's available to collect and on the days I feel like it's too repetitive I just play something else.
---
pardon the tangent below :V
---
For me, I like the freedom of being able to quickly swap my builds around and remain really effective. The massive differences in how a class plays just based on the weapons you use alone is great for versatility. Want to try some new stats? Just craft up with the resources you've collected or stat swap your ascended gear and get some new runes/sigils. I don't think I could stomach the grind to make a different build for my elementalist every time I want to try something different. My current builds I float around between:
---
**PvE builds** *(including open world, dungeons, fractals, raids)*:
---
* condi weaver (sw/d, d/d)
---
* power weaver (sw/d, staff, sc/f), power tempest (overlaps with pweeb + warhorn)
---
* support tempest (heal variant with staff, boon variant with x/wh, hybrid with condi+boon, all with diff stats/runes)
---
**WvW builds** *(including zerging, havoc, roaming)*:
---
* Sage-like roaming weaver (sw/d, possible d/d)
---
* FA or Lightning rod weaver (some overlap with pve builds, sc/f primarily)
---
* Marauder+Zerk combo zerg weaver (staff)
---
* Minstrel support tempest
---
* Hybrid support joat tempest (big mixnmatch of gear)
---
Having Legendary gear is really helpful to that end since I can freely try out new stats/runes/sigils/infusions on the fly, but it was really easy to put together Exotic (and sometimes Ascended) variants for the sake of experimentation. I don't think I could go back to a game where my only option to get better gear is to run a raid each week wherein I'm competing with a bunch of other people for a random drop or relying on a fallback token currency to pick it up after a few weeks. Granted most other MMORPGs are generally more simplified in roles: a Mage in WoW basically used the same gear across all builds with minor adjustments between haste/spell power priority iirc whereas a Druid could legitimately use almost every possible stat for different builds.
---
Going back to a more traditional loot treadmill just feels so... Deflating? All of the gear you grind for just gets invalidated every couple of months, most often with major stat differences that give a serious edge to those who get it first.
---
Give me full analysys of how MO's salary could stop the lay offs. I dare you. Show me numbers and graphs and stuff.
---
And what evidence do we have of this? I didn't realize I knew what was going on at ANet
---
Why'd you assume he didn't do that?  
---
Also, a basic level of punctuation isn't language specific.
---
Ya factoring a sizable chunk of sales to staffing alone, never mind operating costs, marketing etc, makes these numbers far smaller. 
---
You're still a child...that much is obvious from all the responses I see from you.
---
There's a significant difference between a lay off and fired.
---
This is probably off topic, but I see this analogy often and it annoys me. The problem here is that presidents or other politicians are generally not experts and should not be given that kind of authority. For example, a common strategy of politicians is to use the natural shifts of economy to support their views. An economic boon might have happened regardless of whatever the politicians did, but many politicians will still use it to support their views. This is why you need to read actual experts, i.e. academics.
---
I feel I was one of those people. At the very beginning of S4 I thought it's what LS should have been from the beginning. And then it got worse... I hated sponge for healthbar bosses in LS3 and hate them in LS4. I hate that half of the maps is just deserted.  
---
If they kept the schedule, maybe put out stuff faster, from 3 to 2 months maybe, I mean it was three teams, kept improving stuff like Sun's Refuge after initial release instead of one time stuff that is never mentioned again, sometimes return to previous maps (I would LOVE to see core maps updated) instead of pushing for a new one every time then maybe it would be on par with an expansion.  
---
As it is now, I don't believe LS will replace expansions. Too small of a scope, releases stretched too far away from each other.
---
I dont know if its been said but, you can press up on the arrow key to repaste your last send message!
---
The number of in-game cosmetics added would also be interesting. It's something that's been talked about pretty frequently here.
---
"STOP THE PANIC" sounds like something the Captain from the Titanic would have said as the ship struck the Iceberg.
---
soooo... no jumping puzzles in the novels? do we know that for sure?
---
Thank you - I noticed that in their messages they were targeting him rather than NCSoft, which is the one who did the layoffs from my understanding.
---
We had the devs that were fired telling us. 
---
True that, but since I'm no Anet employee nor close to one, I can only assume.
---
Please tell me they aren’t actually this stupid.
---
Correcting the count now, thanks!
---
He was hired by ArenaNet quite some time ago. While OP sensationalizes speculation, he oversaw a team of designers. I’m not sure if he entirely had his hands in GW2

If Guild Wars 2 demanded people spend 15$ a month on top of paying for expansions every 2 years. This game would lose 90% of it's active player base.
---
That doesn't mean people are conservative with their money, it means Guild Wars 2 is a shit game. 
---
Also, story instances and story in general ARE player retention tools, those tools don't work in GW2 because it's a shit game. Doesn't mean they aren't useful tools to keep players engaged in FF14/ESO/WOW
---
ESO runs better? Ha, not if you hear them talk about it. And it has to go down once a week for hours.
---
IMO it depends on the players system. if you have a good system, both games run great. but is you dont... you complain on reddit/forum because GW2/ESO arent "optimised" when really you need to optimise your own system and internets connection first.
---
No way MO's salary could be cut in half to save ~100 people.  Now some of those scumbags at EA making tens of millions a year, yeah.
---
&gt; Doing it after a hundred people lost their jobs completely unexpectedly is just callous, on top of being a poor argument. 
---
LOL no it isn't.
---
Companies don't fire staff if they're producing profit. Games don't produce profit unless they're "doings things right".
---
It's that simple. I can't even imagine the levels of blind devotion it requires to cope post like this right after Anet canned all other side projects AND just lost massive chunk of staff while being forced back under direct NCsoft management.
---
I'm at a loss to think of anything else that could happen to demonstrate that they were, in fact, not doing things correctly according to those who cut the checks.
---
I only have experience with unions in the UK and they usually take a certain stance on stuff. So if this union hates bosses then no they won't. 
---
Lmao should ask the people on reddit instead who think the world is ending. The people playing the game are continuing to play.
---
Agreed and people are angry because good people lost their jobs. u/kiskoller made some [great points](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/auwcrx/unpopular_opinion_my_take_on_the_current_situation/) and I think it would be best if Mike O'Brien spoke on this change in direction to set the record straight.
---
Possibly too soon. 
---
You can always deduce a lot from a few words .  Thick people never learn beyond what comes to them in their natural environment . He obviously has issues in his life. 
---
Back to topic . 
---
GW2 do still have 300 employes but will very likely not be able to go on with their sideprojects outside of GW2 (since NCSoft pulled the plug on those) which in the far run should mean GW2 will be the main focus again. 
---
But at this point we don't know much about how they will restructure or any other info but they still have content for at least a year to come with season 5 and if you start today you have litterally hundreds and hundreds of hours of content to play through and GW2 is very active with enough players around in both start area and endgame. Sometimes you need to use the lfg-tool to get in to a more populated map but that is something you learn along the way.
---
&gt;Or they were offered a financial parachute in the form of a voluntary redundancy
---
I'd assume the "they" is ANet, but I have no idea what a voluntary redundancy is.
---
Somebody else who can do the job?
---
&gt;someone who had been working there for 10+ years saw it as a good opportunity to bow out and try something new with their life, with a nice little financial buffer to help them along the way.
---
I'd prefer to believe this, but regardless of the circumstances of their leaving, they left. Their absence remains cause for uncertainty until the new leadership is proven.
---
&gt;That't not a quote from ArenaNet and it's not sourced to anyone.
---
I know. I said as much when I wrote "*if that is true.*" I've been looking for a source and haven't been able to find one.
---
What bothers me about it is that it flies in the face of what I heard. But so many things are still becoming clear, so many details are still developing, that I don't feel I can discount the possibility entirely.
---
&gt;That was true before the layoffs and it's been true several times in the past.
---
Yes. But layoffs have called the future into question. And the previous actions of NCsoft, where there was more information about the future, indicate that even the plans given by the subsidiary (I am presuming City of Heroes was operated by a subsidiary) may not align with what NCsoft is planning.
---
A lot of games have roadmaps and development plans up these days. And when the future of the company is in question, it's reassuring.
---
You've offered more positive interpretations or possibilities. But the thing is, fear, uncertainty, and doubt isn't alleviated by that. It's just more uncertainty. The only thing that gets rid of it is proof, something that eliminates uncertainty - or time, for the future to become the present and so become clearer.
---
I will say that the words of devs and the fact that GW2 performs better than Aion are good signs. But the situation with City of Heroes does give me pause. If it was producing a new expansion, if they hadn't already closed it, then presumably it was in the black, right? Were they actually propping it up? Were the margins not high enough? Dunno. But that's sort of why they call it FUD I guess.
---
Why are you personally attacking him?
---
Fake news
---
Completely agree with your point. 
---
Losing experienced people does suck, but it also opens up opportunities for new talent.
---
Fair point. Can't really argue with that.
---
\&gt;  the renewed focus on Guild Wars 2, because we were not incredibly focused as a studio 
---
Implying that there wasn't a focus on GW2 to begin with.
---
omg i dont main ele

i just used them as an example.

---
show me where I said it is
---
Oh goodness. I'm not sure how you found Vindictus's hack and slash play to be more engaging than Guild Wars 2 raids. Unless the game has changed massively since 2009-2010 when I played, which is always possible I suppose.
---
Sure, it was exciting, and it felt good, but man it wasn't really all that challenging, to me. I'll grant you the aesthetic design of bosses were more interesting, and it certainly *looked* exciting. But, in reality, it was extremely easy and shallow gameplay, with one strat pretty well working across the board. Mechanics weren't anything new, I'd seen them in a hundred games before.
---
So I suppose it's what you want. To me, VG the model being bland doesn't bother me (though I disagree, I think it fits the theme of what they were going for well. Mysterious, magical guardian type thing that's all silent and has mystical powers. Not something you can interact with and talk to, it's more like a force of nature than anything else). 
---
And I guess a giant polar bear paw, for me, is easily telegraphed and generally boring and trivial to dodge. Having to pay attention to the entire map, looking for the green mechanic (if you're doing greens) while also dodging blues, making sure you have seeker control...That gives each person in the raid personal responsibility. It makes it difficult, it means it requires skill and coordination to pull off.
---
That's more than enough to make it exciting for me, and I'd venture to say most raiders are more interested in the mechanics. Designs are always cool. Deimos's hand-made scarf is a thing of beauty, for instance. And of course all the bosses in Wing 5 and 6 are beautifully designed and really cool. There's a lot more character to them.
---
You don't even have to go to Wings 5 and 6 to see some more character though. Matthias, Xera, and Deimos are examples of fights you would probably find more interesting from an excitement/aesthetic design point of view. Even Sabetha in Wing 1 will have a lot more character than VG.
---
But, to each their own. If you're looking for Vindictus style play, you certainly won't find it in GW2.
---
YOU MEAN PAYING CUSTOMER WHICH ACTUALY THINK,THAT COMPANY ANOUNCING SOMETHING AND THAN ITS DELAYED BY  3 WEEKS IS NORMAL? ARE YOU FROM EA? YOU SEEMS KINDA LIKE SJW BRAINDEAD IDIOT,SINCE IM PAYING FOR IT,IM ENTITLED TO CRITIQUE OF PRODUCT. STOP WITH YOUR IQ 50 FANBOY WHITEKNIGHT SHIT. YOU FORGOT *TOXIC MASCULINITY* IN YOUR RETARDED POST. YOU ARE PURE HUMAN GARBAGE.
---
Honestly, I think we're all expecting them to not retract, and I will be surprised if they do.
---
When it comes to any account with 17k+ followers, retracting ANY statement of ANY kind usually means a weakness in their organization. If anything, large groups tend to double down on their false information in order to drown out the fact they were wrong.
---
I somehow remember gw1 differently especially if you went for some hard mode missions or dungeons...
---
I'd consider it a stand alone expansion similar to Dawn of War Dark Crusade, Assassins Creed Freedom Cry or Gat out of Hell. 
---
They use the base game as the foundation, the player is locked off from a lot of that content but not all of it. In the case of Guild Wars they retained the original professions as well as a core set of skills and kept things like PvP and Guild Activities together to an extent.
---
The same textures were carried over, and ultimately expanded on the original core gameplay. In Factions this was through the introduction of two new professions, more skills, Elite Missions and new PvP activitives. Nightfall was through the introduction of two more professions, more skills, Heroes (literally the definition of a game changing expansion mechanic in every way). Factions and Nightfall were by no means new titles, they just took the existing foundation, cut a little off and built on top of it.
---
Most important of all, in some places people who owned any of those 3 could interact. PvP, Guilds, certain outposts. Didn't matter so long as you had one of the three you could play the same content. 
---
The kicker, was the 3 campaigns together formed one massive connecting storyline building on the original title. You couldn't fully understand Nightfall without playing the previous two entries and vice versa the other two without Nightfall. Each subsequent campaign expanded on the same storyline.
---
Eye of the North took everything from those campaigns, Elite Missions, Heroes, everything and really honestly it might have been the first proper "expansion" but because it was a smaller team than the two seperate teams doing Prophocies, Factions and Nightfall it wasn't that impactful.
---
One of the big reasons for the cancellation of Utopia was it was getting too big. It was going to carry over everything they'd learnt and the tutorial was going to get too big. They had to cram it down to get new players to get it whilst giving enough to older players to buy in. The new mechanic was to be branching questlines. EoTN was built off of that and some very basic work on Campaign 5 and cut down ultimately as a lot of the team moved to GW2 realizing that was a better place for many of the expanding ideas.
---
A very similar conundrum actually to what potentially happened here.
---
Link me to the fire please.
---
You are right about the new account. The source can’t be shared but it is highly credible. Not being a troll. Just sharing what I learned. 
---
DLC chapters often have much, much more story content than living world episodes, in my experience. If GW2 put out content like ESO does, they'd be in a much better spot.
---
Your flair, presumably.
---
I'd rather not.
---
Fuck them. Mike is such a great guy. There are demons in every industry. 
---
Better start laying off NCSoft! :kappa:
---
Is it your 7ncle at nintendo?
---
1 hour of minimum wage (in Canada)
---
I'm memeing. Since when a flair is part of discussion?
---
How could I forget the day Jormag attacked the Anet hq.
---
Technically GW2 has 4 raids so far.
---
Spirit Vale, Salvation Pass and Stronghold of the Faithful are the 3 wings composing the Forsaken Thicket, the first fully shaped GW2 raid with 3 wings, 8 bosses and 3 events. It's a decent sized raids for the MMO standard.
---
Now it's a bit difficult to talk about raids in GW2 as 3 out of the 4 are ridiculously small in comparison to other MMOs, both in scale and number of encounters since the average is around 8 bosses.
---
Bastion of the Penitent, Hall of Chains and Mythwright Gambit are raids on their own but with an average of 3 bosses which is basically the same as a single wing of the Forsaken Thicket. Forsaken Thicket was probably the original size for future raids, back when Anet announced their plan to release 5 of those wings per year, before they realized this community is too reluctant on raiding even when it's intentionally easy and cut the resources of the raid team because there's no way raids would ever be profitable with such a niche playerbase.
---
So does GW2 have 7 raids, or 7 raid wings, or 4 raids, or 2 x 3 mini raids... Yeah, it's a tough comparison. I think the best way to compare is by counting the number of bosses. And I insist on bosses, because some event rewarding a LI just for being on the way to another boss doesn't count as an encounter imo. GW2 has 17 bosses. Spirit Woods, Siege of the Stronghold, Twisted Castle, River of Souls and Statues of Grenth are not bosses and should not even reward anything, that's just silly.
---
-Consistently downward maybe.
---
-People don't care about "the studio" as an abstract entity, they care about the game. Go ask WoW fans if they'd be okay with Blizzard ending WoW to focus on some kind of lootbox filled, Warcraft themed, Battle Royal game.
---
-Neither does Anet apparently from what we are being told.
---
-I'm well aware of the histrionics surrounding CoH. If Anet couldn't operate in such a way that kept that sword of Damocles from falling on them then that's their fault.
---
I don't doubt there are many good and passionate devs at Anet, but the fact is that he was one of the very few that was going out of his way to make/improve/fix things that would most likely be left untouched otherwise. The lack of engagement with the community has been considered one of Anet's biggest flaws so yes him actually taking feedback directly from the players and working on stuff WE WANT to be worked on is something that didn't happen often. I'll be very happy if someone with the same skill and knowledge steps up and fills that spot, but I don't see it happening. 
---
Don't expect anything in the next month. Literally everyone has had their job/responsibilities shifted around. It's likely some people don't even know what teams they're on till the restructuring can be completed. This kind of mass firing can really impact a developer study like Anet so they're going to be trending water for a while. Things are going to be rough but in the end they'll pull through. 
---
Just a clarification, I realize it’s borderline pedantic but I feel it’s important. 
---
No one was fired this week. There is a difference between being fired and laid-off. A firing happens when the employee has done something to warrant no longer working at the company. A lay-off happens when the employee no longer works at the company through no fault of their own. 
---
Beyond that, the term fired has a massively negative connotation that no one from the lay-off deserves attaches to them. 
---
Time will tell ;)
---
I have over 4k hours since Launch, I 2nd these statements.  2,376 days and the game has had its up and downs, but its no longer a top interest of mine. Personally I hope that this NCSoft change brings some much needed attention that GW2 needs. But time will tell. 
---
Yeah I was in a few over the years
---
And this is the response from Games Unite to my email.
---
Thank you so much for your feedback, I genuinely appreciate it. That tweet you are mentioning has been taken down and we've put up an apology. The original tweet about O'Brien was made by one of our social media managers without permission by our general membership and members who work at ArenaNet.

Just because it's a modified GW1 engine doesn't mean it's *bad*. Most game engines have the same broad architecture, it's what the modifications were that matter.
---
i dont agree tho.
---
Ive finished murkmire story in 2 afternoons, clockwork in 3-4 just because i was going for dailies and other side quests which isnt much different than the rate which i "consume" new LW story content.
---
Im not counting side achievements and collections as i wasnt counting them for living world in this case either.
---
Ill leave the OP to research the amount of content eso provided and to compare it to gw2 (including the cost of it all i guess, be it via sub or not). 
---
as for community moral, well, eso does try its best to keep it high ,and one tamriel update did wonders for it, as well as all the bug and feature fixes it did over the first year or two since its release
---
What's the armor on the blue sylvari? It looks magnificent! 
---
I did not keep up with WoW raids after I left mid-Cata but WoW always had some "encounters" that are not technically a boss fight. Executus (arguable), Karazhan's Chess, Flame Leviathan, ICC's Gunship... I guess you could say there is one of those "odd encounters" per xpac, that's one out of 40 bosses roughly, not nearly as common as it is in GW2. 
---
Why Bear- Bow ranger of course!  :&gt;)

[Here's my charr scourge!](https://i.imgur.com/FqKDpHI.jpg) My headcanon for her is that she was born and raised an Olmakhan, but left for the solitude and dry climate of the Crystal Desert, where she spends her free time using her sandshifting talents to craft and sell desert jackal pups. Ironically, she has a hypersensitive nose, which she has to keep covered while outdoors to prevent the dust and sand from causing massive bouts of sneezing. 
---
I got into the game because of Path of Fire. Not any Living World seasons. Which I still haven't really played.
---
This x 1000%. I loved guild wars 2 to death, until they started nickel and diming me for everything. I know I didn't have to buy things, but I'm a roleplayer and tend to play games more for aesthetic/story/collecting things (pets/mounts/dyes/outfits). I took a long break from the game due to the practices and realizing I was spending 2-3x more a month on their shop items than I was in a subscription based game with just a few shop items.
---
What pissed me off was they'd put something up and be like "X AMOUNT OF TIME ONLY! THEN WE TAKE IT AWAY AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE IT AGAIN!" The third or fourth time they brought something back that was never "meant" to return I caught onto the shitty pressure-based sales and was pissed enough to leave the game.
---
Then they put in mounts and that horror show of mount skin packs being the new "here-then-gone", "lootbox to collect them all" thing and I left again. Which really sucks, I loved the game but between the megaserver merging making it so roleplaying was infinitely harder to be grouped with people despite what they said, the gem store manipulation tactics, and things that might be weird to some people...but the wave of content every 2 weeks that made it so my friends were all too busy farming 24/7 to get all the things (items/achievements/etc) and felt too pressured to actually spend time with each other...I just didn't have it in me to play any more. I'm also a very private person so I always had a hard time getting over the "everyone has your username and can therefore see all your alts" thing. I protested heavily the use of battlenet tags. Sometimes I just want to log on and do my own thing but not necessarily be on invisible, unable to chat with my guild on an alt or what have you (and the invisible function still updated when you moved location so it became easy enough to tell who was "invisible" lol).
---
It's a beautiful game, I love the lore, I'll always appreciate it but you have to go in with your eyes opened to how they operate and while some things were just my personal preference - other things were tactics the company used that disgusted me too much to enjoy when I was playing because they left such a bad taste in my mouth.
---
Why do you loathe all PvP out of curiosity?
---
Just dont do pvp. You kinda have first hand experience. 
---
~~I'm sorry if it's too lowbrow. My humor is pitch black~~
---
This, so much.
---
I have attempted to level an engineer just to play a holosmith AGAIN, but then I stop to ask myself... "What for?"
---
Gearing my character has become much more expensive since the Rune/Sigil rework.
---
Leveling isn't a joy anymore. I envy the new players that come here and praise the exploration because it's their first time in the game but... Hearts and Vistas lose their charm after that, quickly. There isn't much you can do once you reach the endgame, when you complete a map's Hearts, there's virtually no reason to go back to them besides farming materials and doing a couple dailies. This wouldn't be a problem if the instanced content wasn't so stagnated :/
---

What a cute backstory! I can just imagine her carefully putting the finishing touches on a desert jackal, and then - *ACHOO!* - accidentally blowing it all apart and cringing before she sighs and starts over from scratch :D
---
[Karmic Retribution](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Karmic_Retribution) from the living world adds up to a ton, especially doing something like Istan. Tequatl daily rewards a ton as well.
---
Why is the whole building empty today? Because thay booted 25% of their staff. So promising that it would not affect GW2 is already a broken one (and an utterly redicoulus one). Now take your hurt feelings out of here and start thinking before being rude.
---
How was condi scourge and spellbreaker nerfed? Don't see them as much in wvw now
---
You hurt whatever feelings I got left :'(
---
That counts as content, things people work towards.  Having attainable goals in an mmo are important.  You absolutely can compare gw and ESO's sets as they are both considered endgame content to work for.  Also since they are direct competitors in the market, it would be strange not to compare them.  If you want to compare transmuting to ESO's wardrobe, well guess which one is better, ESO's.  Far more customization options, it does fashion wars better than GW.  I'll always love GW, but their content doesn't compare to what other MMOs offer.
---
Pichu wasn’t around until G/S.
---
I'm curious why a man like this was let go though? In his case was it a voluntary thing or was he on the list?
---
Yeah lot of fans of COH. Myself included. But yeah I think part of it too was the f2p conversion. Back then most MMOs that weren't Korean were still subscription, COH was never created with f2p in mind and a lot of their f2p model was fairly generous which I don't think NCSoft liked at the time.
---
I suppose it also didn't help that it was an older MMO also, since probably 2010-2012 or so it's been far easier for companies doing something like an MMO to host parts of the game in the cloud. They wouldn't have to operate their own servers and just pay for what's actively being used and scale what they need dynamically on the fly. Unfortunately back then running an MMO would have meant dedicated hardware to keep it all together, I imagine today it's probably far easier to run an MMO from a hardware perspective than back then. Think GW2 was probably NCsoft's first cloud based MMO I'm pretty sure GW2 is hosted in Amazon's cloud if I'm not mistaken
---
Just my thought. I played 18k hours since release and will now go in standby mode (aka Weekly Raidclear only) until I get a trustworthy schedule that isn't PR Bullshit.
---
Well there’s 11 total achievements, but you only need ten for the back item. 
---
WvW was laggy before linking, same with bandwaggoning. It didnt really change much except for low populated servers being in the action now aswell. 
---
Will they introduce a USB dick-sucker too?
---
Really? That's great, I guess I missed that part. 
---
I will make this easy for myself 
---
- regular updates for all game modes 
---
- more communication for upcoming stuff and stuff in development
---
- a tease for either lws6 (god please dont go there) or expac 3

Found the source link if that helps: [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/836170/#Comment\_836170](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/836170/#Comment_836170)
---
Believe it or not, there are positions between "PANIC" and "everything is perfect" you know...
---
The game has direction, but there is only so much you can do to steer that direction if you don't have the resources necessary. 
---
Im aware but this subreddit is sat at the panic end.
---
Mobile titles with prospects of making far more money at far less cost.
---
It's pretty much just this:
---
1. Get a piece of ascended gear (weapon/armor) you want to change to a new stat
---
2. Get an inscription/insignia for the stat you do want
---
3. Follow the recipe on the wiki page I linked above
---
Step 1 can be achieved by crafting something with core stats, taking a piece of armor you've gotten via drops, or just straight up converting a piece you already use. Note that any runes/sigils/infusions will be destroyed on swap, so extract them if necessary (especially infusions since it's relatively cheap to remove them) 
---
You're going to have the same cost to craft the armor aside from the inscription/insignia anyways for core stats, but HoT and PoF direct crafting add a bunch of extra stuff. I don't remember which is the cheapest to craft, and it kind of depends on which recipes you already have / can easily get.
---
[deleted]
---
I guess it's a few reasons...
---
The first would be that I find the competitive nature brings out the worst in people in almost all respects. This manifests in a number of ways, including toxic behavior, bullying, and general meanspiritedness.
---
Another reason would be that in the current massively multiplayer online format that most games find themselves in (including but not limited to GW2), there eventually will come to exist a "Meta" that crushes creativity and is further grounds for toxicity. To snag a quick example, if you play a MOBA poorly enough you can be harrassed and your team will quit on you. There are others.
---
Then there is the flip side of this coin, where you can wind up as the punching bag for the kind of people who live and breathe these games... or (admittedly) skilled players who intentionally drop to slaughter less skilled opponents. Or people who twink their characters, in some games.
---
Basically, in some instances it can be pretty cool to be in complete control of your character, fighting at the best of your ability in a true contest of skill... but if the other person cheeses, twinks, or even if they're just flat out way better than you, then you have a bad time.
---
I'd say more than half of my experience in modern PVP games ends up in the bad times zone. Maybe it's because I'm getting old, or maybe I have the wrong expectations going into these games, but I prefer a solo or cooperative experience where I don't have to worry about griefers or trolls ruining my game.
---
don't listen to him we love you Sam! continue comme ça!
---
I hope that Mike's mood will at least lighten up a little, when he hears the news and apologies. 
---
Also take into account how this content is perceived, doesn't matter if Game A pushes out a ton of content, if noone likes that content, or it messes with the game in a way that is a detriment (most notably for WoW, WoD and BfA)
---
I do have a harrier druid but me not a good druid player so she’s sat aside lol. Now I only do pwr warrior and healerquickbrand (firebrand with harrier full set) I used to play mesmer, hqb and spbkr are easy to play too
---
lol, the problem is GW2 *isn't* a CPU hog, it just bottlenecks itself on one thread
---
I appreciate the input on gold farming. Currently playing pretty casually and log in usually once a day for rewards but am only actually playing several hours a week. My current gold farming strat has been:
---
Basically every day:
---
- Daily Ascended Materials sold on TP (going to stop selling these to begin crafting gear)
---
- Account Dailies (2g is not much but it's usually pretty quick/easy)
---
A few times a week:
---
- Fractal Dailies
---
- Do daily iron/plat/elder wood/flax gathering runs (have my route down to 30mins per character -- 20 mins if I skip plat)
---
Probably once a week or less:
---
- Istan
---
- (Every now and then) Silverwastes RIBA
---
As you can see, and because of my schedule, I rarely make it all the way down to Istan/RIBA. If I'm trying to prioritize gold income, do you think that's the right "order" to be doing things in? Or, for example, is Istan so lucrative that I should be doing that first? I guess I'm effectively asking for a tier list of gold income, in your opinion.
---
Another question for you if you don't mind me pestering you...
---
Can you go into more detail on the "Elite spec collection"? For example, I have a Thief @ 80 that could get the staff. Is it account bound and stat selectable to ones I'd want? I'm just not familiar on what the proces sis.
---
THIS^
---
I tried repairing it again and it worked. :P im on
---
No, other games just hide it better or they develop with the process seen in my #2 point above (i.e. Nintendo's long dev times).
---
The entire Agile and DevOps movements in Software Dev came about to help ensure the quality of work in Dev products while trying to account for the fact that teams simply "don't know what they don't know".  
---
I cannot count on 4 hands the amount of times we made changes to a codebase in preparation for a new feature and an unknown bug was suddenly triggered by the new code that was always there but never seen. It happens when code bases are in the thousands of lines (let alone millions or billions of lines). Even with automated testing and manual QA, you will never find it all and, simply put, some of Development is R&amp;D just to find out if a desired feature or product is even possible.
---
Removed: I understand your interest given the current situation, but even in light of the ArenaNet layoffs this topic is in no way related to Guild Wars 2. 
---
I hope you'll share what you'll do instead. I totaly understand not everybody will want to join. But only by playing the game, and doing your own stuffs, it's a thank to the devs too. While you play and enjoy what they built you tell them this: "well done" ;-)
---
People vastly underestimate the size of the casual and competitive playerbases.
---
The entire reason GW2 was successful to begin with was because ANet knew that those two groups of players define both a vast percentage of the market share for profitability (which is why selling power is bad).
---
Hardcore PvE and completionists are the tiniest groups in most games, maybe aside dedicated PvE titles.  And even then, games like Wildstar and Runescape EOC, focused entirely around hardcore PvE, failed, because of the fact the niche was too small.  These players may be some of the more passionate and vocal ones in the game (nobody who plays casually will write a lot on the forums, learn spawn timers, care about their account worth, hunt down lost pages of story, etc.), but they are the absolute minority with some of the fastest burnout-per-dollar and overall usually weigh a net negative on dev cost : earnings based on how much time needs to get invested into development and how little time it takes to complete the content for this group.
---
I hate to say it, but right now a roadmap for the future has probably never been more non-existent. Whether they had an internal one before or not, everything is out the window until they have some time to let the dust settle.
---
No balance changes have gone in, last changes to them was the [December patch](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/December_2018). Any difference you're seeing now is just chance.
---
I'd like to point out an interesting effect called the Pareto Distribution. Essentially it's the "80-20 Rule" that is observable in the workplace ( as well as others, but I digress.). What it means is that 20% of the workforce does 80% of the work. They just cut 25% of the workforce.
---
I know that it's pessimistic to assume that means things are going belly up, but it's not a rare phenomenon for cuts like this to happen in companies that are in a death spiral. And, when they cut the highest paid members in an attempt to save costs, they also cut the people who were doing the majority of the work. I only say this to temper blind optimism.
---
As I do not exactly know where your problem lies this is a good build guide for core Mesmer https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mesmer_-_Greatsword_Burst
---
For the three trees(starts at level 21 if I’m not mistaken )I would start with the dueling tree, after that you can pick the one you like more of the other two. For stats you want berserker gear or in lower levels it’s called strong like strong ring of xyz the stat priority looks like power&gt;precision&gt;ferocity as to how to use your skills the guide tells you under general use. If you have any other questions feel free to ask. 
---
The problem is that this decision was imposed by NCSoft, who has a history of shutting down games arbitrarily because they're too much hassle.
---
Well he didn't make the decision but ultimately anet lost the staff due to poor development which MOB is accountable for, or should be.
---
Spot on.
---
I see a fanboy here.
---
For starters, gw2 has a ton of ways to get any kind of stats, and once at ascendant tier it becomes account wide, and also stat swapable for a small price. This also includes ascendant trinkets which also have a few sets that can be stat swapped.
---
In eso , everything is streamlined trough cp160, and in order to get any better at anything you need synergies and 2-3 stat sets.
---
Now yes, some can be crafted, some come from dungeons, some from raids, some from undaunteds , but they are all separated.
---
You cant get Dreugh King Slayer set from random loot, mercs, crafting, etc...you can only get it from 1 dungeon as rng loot. 
---
But you can get berserker stats anywhere in the game in any way you find more fun.
---
And eso is full of rng loot. 
---
Say i get my 5 random gear items with Dreugh King Slayer (and hope i got it with good traits, otherwise ill have to grind more to be able to change them...in someones "guild hall" with the station for it if i dont have the expansion.
---
Now i need to work on another set to get stronger...except if i get ,lets say a glove with a 2nd stat set, but my first stat set is on my glove already...whelp time to deconstruct it for mats and grind some more.
---
2 part monster sets are the same. Do specific challenging hard mode dungeon for 100% helmet, but then do your dailies for rng keys and hope you get the right shoulders.
---
Trading with other players in eso is shouting in map chat, OR join multiple trading guilds so you open up your self to a larger market, namely auction houses that belong to those guild. However most of those guilds require you to make a specific amount of profit per month (some asked me for specific amount of profit per week) , if not i get kicked.
---
So if i want to have the choice of something like an auction house (which are all basically limited inside guild members, and some specific local areas if they own a shop somewhere in the world) i have to farm and find out ways to earn a profit constantly to meet my weekly/monthly quota...
---
Addons are amazing in ESO, specially the ones that add things that should be in a mmorpg,but are not. 
---
Things like better inventory ui and filtering, icons for points of interest on maps, better UI in general with skills, damage, buffs, debuffs...a minimap as well since the game doesnt have one...
---
Now im sure people say its a tes game, its a design choice, no other tes game has minimaps...true...but no other tes is a mmorpg..and 2-6million people downloading minimap,sky shards,lorebooks,destinations addons would agree.
---
The games buggy, people hack using cheat engine (in a mmo...in 2019), and the game is not really alt friendly unless you have friends or already have a high lvl character that can fund them and craft sets for them...which you need and lots of loot to research traits and lvl up crafting..and also buy the dlcs that offer the good craftable stat sets
---
The balance? Seriously? Eso pve end game has a meta that hasnt changed for a very very long time now, and you only see a few skills swapped here and then and maybe get a new stat set form that new content that just came out. And lets not even start on pvp...
---
Combat? Do you call "weaving" combat? Is that intentional? A feature? Imagine,like in any other game, where the devs try to balance skill effects and damage with cast time and cooldowns, and then the players completely ignore cast time (or animation, call it what you want) by spamming auto attacks....turning "normal" attacking and spell casting from 14/16k dps into 28/30k dps by "weaving"
---
But zenimax is working really hard to fix a lot of bugs, problems, and issues troughout the year i can give them that. Im not joining white gold tower as a lvl 15 newbie anymore via random dungeon finder anymore after several years...but steam users still cant log in randomly after game patches is still a thing going on which doesnt seem to be going anywhere.
---
Good for you :)
---
&gt; 2. NCSoft is a Korean company, and I'm pretty sure an American union group has no power over them.
---
NCWest exists, and is essentially the same as NCSoft; it's a division they made so that they can publish games in, well, the West.
---
How much of this news has to do with guild wars 2 being completely over staffed? I thimk I read Anet has 400 employees while games like ESO that are also on xbox, PS4 and yearly expansion only has 350. Anyone know if Anet was originally over staffed? 
---
Also other companies emplyees:
---
-path of exile has 120 
---
-Warframe has 200
---
-Funcom has 135(and it shows)
---
-Final fantasy 14 has around 270
---
-I have read that wow is around the 200-250 mark before  the lay-offs. 
---
Thanks for the answer. You seem to know more than me about the subject. I'm not saying that a co-op doesn't have to be as profitable: I'm just saying that instead of sending X$ to shareholders, who always ask for more (and thus requires sometimes cuts to increase dividend further), this money can stay within the co-op and be reinvested in the co-op as increase in salaries or services.   
---
For example, I've work at a company for 7 years that was literally making billions of dollars in *profits* **but** they were still asking us to do more with less and cutting everywhere to increase the *already decent* shareholders dividends. Because shareholders always want more. The co-op model would have prioritize our well-being (increase our salaries or benefits).    
---
I don't know about the details of starting a new game company as a co-op, but I feel ?? that transforming an *already established* and profitable one to a cooperative could be a good idea when faced with the threat of closure from shareholders who are somewhat unsatisfied with their dividends. I don't know about Anet situation, but from my understanding the company is profitable ***as is*** and the cuts are mostly there to satisfy upper management and shareholders. Also, I think there's studies showing that co-op workers are usually more productive because they're happier at work and feel more invested because they communally own the workplace.  
---
But thanks for your insight, it's true that the co-op model probably can't be apply to every field. I just feel that it's not considered often enough.   
---
Sorry if I have some trouble explaining myself, english being my second language. 
---
When Molten Facility came out I was blown away at the idea of Living Story. At the time ANet felt very strongly about it and said they'd dole out expansion style features through living story. I thought "Wow!, we'd get a patch every month and each patch would be an addition to a different game type. A dungeon in Feb. Events in March. Story instances in April. Another dungeon in June. I wouldn't mind this over an expansion."
---
If you think so, you really don't understand PETA. I mean that in a "holy shit PETA is so much worse than this" sort of way.
---
&gt;Are you using meta for T4s? If you're doing meta T4s because you know how raids are with meta builds. You should be fine just reading up and watching a few vids on the encounter. If not I have no idea what you are doing
---
It doesn't matter that I learn everything about raids if I don't get the chance to use it. There is no killproof given from watching videos.
---
&gt;You generally burst them and dodge... You don't get the big damage if you dodge the explosion at the end you know :/. Just bring some cleave/utility if you don't have much cleave such as necro well of darkness/sandstorm.
---
Cool, next you'll tell me that you need is infinite dodge.  
---
&gt;What do you mean by this? There are many groups that do not require this in the general T4 LFG? Unless you join a group that specifically states that, you don't even ping anything, hell you don't even ping your build, you just go and do it.
---
It means because of difficulty tiers, people have confidence on T3 players that is getting into T4 to know how to do each fractals. You say that Fractals are harder than Raids. Yet, barely anyone cares about builds or kill proofs in Fractals and vice-versa in Raids. 
---
With difficulty tier, a person like you, who learn in getting killed over and over again in T4, can get the opportunity to learn T4 because Fractal groups knows that you can bring some weight. Whereas without difficulty tier, any new player can't get into fractals because they'll force you to ping 250 Fractal Journals in order to get in.
---
Gaile was let go...
---
Gaile of all people. One of the most widely liked Devs/Customer Support Liaisons.
---
Any reason why they forbid him to talk on forums/reddit?
---
The game is getting stale
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Armor_of_Koda_(medium)
---
The people attacking you are blowing the whole thing out of proportion, but your habit of putting spaces before each period and comma is kinda weird and not correct.
---
What's your first, though?
---
I have my own opinions on balance priority etc which I will keep to myself because it tends to not be popular on this subreddit and I'd rather not have to defend myself again.
---
On the other point:
---
I mean my experience has been the opposite. Both my most welcoming, fun and long lasting community memberships have been because of PvP/WvW.
---
In fact, I have never had a purely PvE focused group of friends/circle in the game last more than a few months.
---
Man, WvW especially we would shoot the shit for hours for 2 years ish, it was a great time I can't lie.
---
To each their own I suppose.
---
Have you tried getting gud?
---
Anet management are responsible for the development of any projects by anet so whether the initial idea came for anet or NCSoft is  irrelevant.
---
\&gt;  Someone at end-game in GW2 is doing *all of the raids, and all of the T4 fractals*, and living world. And they're gearing horizontally into different roles. 
---
Some people have been doing that for years, but how much time do you want to spend running the same mini dungeons from 2013. I don't quite see the appeal of doing old content over and over for years and years.
---
You can also go back to older raids and dungeons in some other MMOs, either by soloing them for cosmetic rewards, or through special events that scale those instances up. That's in addition to the current "endgane" that gets added periodically.
---
trials are raids yes, like wow raids, harder than dungeons and offer epic/legendary loot (exotic/ascendant)
---
There are normal dungeons, hard dungeons, trials, hard trials
---
Public dungeons can be compared to what the first HoT personal story step has to offer. 
---
Its an instanced zone that multiple random people can join in. 
---
It has a few quests, a couple of "elite" bosses that most people can solo even on low lvl by kiting a lot and a few achievements tied to completing the quests and killing all "elite" mobs.
---
The story in eso ,as far as i understood are done like this.
---
You have your "core" personal story (often instanced) and then every zone has a main storyline quest chain with multiple side quests, all of them are open world.
---
Dungeon dlc offer a few quests and dungeons.
---
"zone" dlcs such as murkmire and clockwork city are essentially like all other open world zones, as in they offer 1 main storyline for that specific zone + side quests.
---
However ,they only recently started to tie in the lore, npc characters in the storyline across multiple zone dlc and chapters (clockwork city storyline continues on into summerset chapter for example). Almost everything else till that point was its own storyline in its own zone.
---
Sure there are some mentions that happen in other places of the world and some "medium-major" characters re-appear from old "core" open world zones into zone dlcs and chapters but its not really much important.
---
Same way as bandits from queensdale are important to lake doric white mantle, or as lord faren from human act 1 is important to HoT verdant brink events with lord faren.
---
Public dungeons could be considered as a very large mini dungeon/jumping puzzle ,but with a few quests , champion mobs and achievements i guess but instanced (but still open for anyone to join in...soo..idk what was the point of it being instanced)
---
Yes, especially if you are doing it to the point where you are noticeably affecting the markets, you risk getting banned. But... I have heard of "some people" who might use macros for tedious things like the mystic forge and candy corn gobbler, and it doesn't seem like Anet really monitors it or cares about it. As long as you're not: A. making lots of gold from it or B. a total moron talking about it in LA map chat you probably won't get caught. But it's against the rules so don't do it. 
---
I'm a player and I'm living my life. I'm not worrying at all. Whatever it happens I won't change it, I made quite a lot of completion of the game and only play it to spend some time with friends. Eventually a game ends its cycle or the player gets burnt. Getting obsessed is the bad thing.
---
\&gt; a la transformers bullshit
---
Had a good laugh at this. Upvote for you.
---
I'm guessing you main Asuran
---
I'm so happy to be proven right after all these years.  I want to thank all the shilling white knights that downvoted all my posts over the years. 
---
Yup. Letting him save face so he can look like he parted ways for another opportunity in a few weeks. Just remember this post when this happens so in the future you all know I am for real. 
---
&gt; You could put the WoW team through a blender and they would still know to put out expansions with dungeons, new item tiers, raids, and some casual over world content.
---
And, yet, Warlords of Draenor happened. I still don't understand that disaster. (I understand why BFA shipped the way it did, but WoD was inexcusable.)
---
Cool thanks. I've seen the rascal mask before. I think the closest I'll get of the Bladed Mask :-/
---
It's very hard to have repeatable content without a gear treadmill but hey, what do i know? 
---
No no no. *Peace* is an undiscovered country. The future is what we make of it. Or what our corporate overlords make of it, in this case.
---
In GW2 it's "more of the same shit I'm all ready doing, with a tiny patch of new wallpaper taped onto the exact same wallpaper from years ago"
---
Removing this for a combination of trying to stir up drama and also because they have withdrawn that call.
---
Well, for a start Anet was still profitable so that doesn't work. And my point isn't that they shouldn't have laid people off, it's that they did it with absolutely no consideration for those people or the company - some of Anet's best devs got shafted because they happened to be working on other projects.
---
oof 2pm PST. I'm going to be in class.
---
Despite most of Archeage being.. well.. Archeage, the swimming and sailing mechanics there were pretty good tbh.
---
Too many people blindly fan boy
---
Some people are still trying to spin this whole ordeal in some way or another, trying to shift blame away from ArenaNet, like no one there was at fault for any of this.
---
Shills, white knights, fanboys, call them what you want, the point still stands.
---
&gt; Can you go into more detail on the "Elite spec collection"? For example, I have a Thief @ 80 that could get the staff. Is it account bound and stat selectable to ones I'd want? I'm just not familiar on what the proces sis.
---
Each spec has one collection for an ascended weapon with a couple stat choices. [For instance, the Daredevil's Staff will let you get celestial, marauder, or minstrel's stats.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bo) You can click the "Bo" right under "Acquisition" to get the collection's details, and if you search for "Bo" in the in-game achievement panel, you should find it.
---
The only "fanboy" here is you, since you are arguing against yourself about something that is provable by just looking at update notes.  It's obviously been a long time since you've played ESO, but the PVE meta changes every quarter with the balance changes. They literally rework gear sets at least once a year to keep competitive sets in all areas of play (crafting, AvA, BGS, overland, etc) I mean it literally changed yesterday with the new DLC. How can you knock ESO's meta, when GW has a meta for far longer for all game modes. And then as far as matching gear sets, it does take more work than GW and that is a good thing that keeps people in the game participating in different areas and old maps/dungeons, unlike GW.  As far as hacking goes, there are far more instances of hacking in WvW than AvA.  I'm not sure I've every actually come up against a hacker in AvA or BG's in ESO.  As far as bugs, every mmo has those and I think it's hard to say ESO is in a lesser state than GW2 when one is claiming millions of players while one is laying off staff.  I personally like weaving as doing it well has a higher skill cap than most of the combat in GW.  It's ok that you like GW2 better than ESO, however you're straight up lying to yourself if you believe that GW has content releases near what ESO puts out, with a similar pay model.  
---
He talked too much. Didn't say anything huge, but PR is North Korea levels of policing, so he was spanked for it.
---
400 employees and this level of output is an embarrassment. If it was me, I wouldn't be surprised by the layoff.
---
Companies make one product: money. 
---
Maybe if less time was spent being touchy feely, mailing devs cupcakes, and singing their praises for every trickle of content, we wouldn't be in this situation. 
---
Devs are arent heroes. They have to produce content, make money, repeat. No content, no money, no game.
---
Super stoked about that Kung Fu tea and zine, tho.
---
I'm now convinced she was the troll ruining the forums. Thanks for the link. SJW down!!!
---
We didn't knew about the layoffs! Thank you!
---
A Guildie of mine, wiped Dhuum CM at 0.61%, hr feels you^^"
---
Mind sharing some examples for that? Could come in handy to show people here how other companies do things.
---
&gt;Roller Beetles need decent mount races. And no, what we got isn't decent, it's just some checkpoints and speed boosters. We need a whole game mode ala Mario Kart for the beetles to be worth their inclusion.
---
Kind of like when FFXIV added chocobo racing and added a Mario kart like series of instanced tracks and a chocobo raising/breeding system?
---
It's not as though GW2 hasn't done it before, either. Sanctum Sprint is a proof of concept.
---
Synthwave is where it's at, you filthy peasants!
---
I get more fps in ARK Survival Evolved on max than Gw2 lol.
---
NCsoft would have known about them and had reports on them, so what, doesn't make Anet management any less responsible.
---
Awesome answer. Didn't even know I needed this info but it was great. Thank you. 
---
Cool thanks. Dumb question but... do you need to be on your Thief and/or specced as daredevil to complete that collection? I have a Thief so I can do that if needed, just curious.
---
Yup, roller beetle races are an improvement from PoF races, but still far from what they should be.
---
How do you know anet was still profitable? What was their return on investment? Was the ROI at the required level for NCsoft? Clearly not given whats happened. 
---
And they have given them full severance, and had a voluntary scheme. They gave them as much consideration as they possible could.
---
