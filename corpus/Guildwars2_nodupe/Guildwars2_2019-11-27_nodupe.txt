I run Personal Battering Ram when I'm doing open world stuff. Sure it's a not the best dps utility, but I find that I always need some extra CC when I solo champions etc. other than holo forge skills. 
---

---
You could also look into CC consumables like planks and rocks. They are a couple of coppers each and deal quite a bit of breakbar damage. You can buy both from Skritt in Brisban Wildlands.
---
---
---
This is probably a prerequisite to apply to be an Anet dev nowadays :P
---
Could you give me the source? Seems very troubling if true... I'm hoping it's not but I could be wrong.
---
1-2 weeks if you were extraordinarily casual maybe. You could do it easily in a few days as well.
---
In theory you're correct, but this is his personal Twitter account. If the game were truly winding down and going into maintenance mode chances are he would feel at least somewhat down about it. He certainly wouldn't be going out of his way to respond to peoples' tweets to reassure them in his spare time. He has no incentive to lie to people about his thoughts about the future of the game there.
---
*Laughs in flamethrower*
---
&gt; So to say that they are better raids is just wrong and false. 
---
Well you could say they are better if the speaker is looking for easier content.
---
&gt;Last week, Rubi laid out a roadmap of 3 updates, and today announced that the first piece is landing Dec 3rd.
---
Please could you provide a link to source this?
---
I wasted 3 hours on raid lfg today and we wasn't able to fill our group. Because we missed some specific roles. Guild Wars 2 was announced as mmorpg which lets you play whatever class you wants to. Meantime looking for players here is harder than in average mmorpg with holy trinity... In these mmo you need just: tank, heal and dps. It's simple. In Guild Wars 2 it looks like you need a lot more weird roles and builds. This is totally dumb. Furthermore every single raiding guild I joined is not raiding anymore.
---
&gt;So if you are asking if anyone requested build loadouts, the answer is yes.
---
I'm asking why people requested ~~build~~ equipment loadouts but kept calling them Build Templates.
---
[Roadmap](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1105123#Comment_1105123) &amp; [Dec 3](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1105123#Comment_1105123)
---
Everyone talking about Jacarandas but what about those verteran dust mite twisters that break off into three dust mites that will give you permanent blindness? Fuck dust mites.
---
&gt;“living world” games are going to change over time
---
Funny, since it's actually as formulaic as it gets. Even the new saga is, so far, taking the same approach as season 2...
---
&gt; 4-5 would be straight up defense for you and allies and apply aegis. I want this now.
---
...anyone going to tell them about offhand shield?
---
There are new People, like me, who dont know that ;)
---
[minimizing button clicks was important enough to showcase](https://twitter.com/GuildWars2/status/1188844083294326785)
---
&gt; Jackal here is a fern hound. 
---
No. We just want a big regular fern hound.
---
And the bigger regular fern hound can teleport. Nobody cares if that wasn't in lore. We just want our giant good boi!
---
Remember karma buff stacking that worked on karma pots
---
well, frankly, I think there was a time when GW2 was the most content rich mmo, especially since it doesn't invalidate any of it's content with new releases like other mmos. season 3 into path of fire into season 4 was really really good.
---
Lol Jessica Price used her personal Twitter too. I think they’ve all learned to only give good pr.
---
I think if you really value the greatsword that highly you could take it over focus, but I still wouldn't run domination. WPs build has no source of fury, which is a significant damage loss. You could mitigate this by running pack runes (as this will occasionally give your phantasms fury, which will then be transferred back to you), but even then dueling should be more damage.
---
People like to shit on Revive Orbs, but they're one of my most liked BLC drops.
---
Through parsec?
---
Nope. Steam link app. Just linked my account to steam so
---
It was never intended to be obscure. We're looking into ways to make this more obvious to the player.
---
The logic for disappearing is when the enemy dies or 15s has gone by. The reason behind that is a bit of a time pressure to use the skill as they are reactionary skills but also so you don't have a bunch of Special Actions Skills stacked up at once in areas like the meta where that can be excessive.
---
Nobody stops you to make your own group without any of those needs. Those special roles are there because they are effective for that certain content, with good synergy, or whatever. If you have skilled players, you will kill anything with any builds.
---
Meta is jsut suggestion for people who don't know better.
---
No. Not all wrong memories are Mandela effects. They're shared. There aren't a group of people misremembering the quote from the movie.
---
Also nothing says you can't use more than one plant in the design.  Borrow from several places. 
---
For example you could have the central body of the skimmer be a large flat rock(you know the kind good for skipping)  and then have mosses, vines and aloe wings all growing from the top of tree stone to create the skimmer. You could have it dripping and the drops/puddles could be bioluminescent (and dyable?) Just like some algae.
---
That's another thing I would expect of a sylvari based mount set would be bioluminescent dye channels btw
---
Honestly, I greatly enjoy GW2 PvP. I think it's my favorite PvP implementation in any game I have played (including Guild Wars, where Alliance Battles are a close second).
---
I totally understand if you don't like PvP. To each their own. I personally don't care much for this game's PvE. That said, I sometimes feel that this community is harsh towards PvP because of survivorship bias. Anet only really cares about PvE, so only PvE players remain.
---
Admittedly, there are a few toxic folks, and because the game mode is somewhat neglected, it ends up being sparsely populated at times, leading to poor match-ups. These problems can be fixed by getting more people to play.
---
I would strongly recommend giving PvP another shot! The more people to play, the better the community becomes!
---
I loved them!
---
Nah man, I understand that feeling. I love to see how each race looks with different armor and skill animations but... I can't afford both fashion wars and too many additional slots :P
---
Still a little worried about spending money on a game that many people are claiming is 'dying'
---
Why ask the narrative guy these things?
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the clarification. Happy to know the obscurity is being looked into, and to see Arenanet staff actively engaged online to address player questions/concerns. :)
---
I wish I’d gotten to do them :(
---
I think it stems from WANTING to come back. It’s good to have people that want a reason to come back. If everyone were completely ambivalent the game wouldn’t have made it this far.
---
Jessica Price going on a rant on her personal Twitter has absolutely no relevance to the point I was making. It's just a random red herring.
---
Why would someone working on a dead game bother to reassure fans on their personal Twitter? He's a dev. He's not the president of the company. If he didn't honestly believe the game had a future it would be very easy for him to jump ship to another company - he's narrative director, which is a fairly senior position that carries some weight.
---
Whether you think he's correct about the game's future is another question. It's perfectly valid to question that - he may well be wrong, or misguided, or deluded. But to argue that he's being intentionally disingenuous to make ArenaNet money just doesn't make sense. We're not talking about a corporate mouthpiece.
---
Some months it was mere hours, with the main one holding you back often being "Complete dailies 4 times" or something like that which of course took 4 days no matter what when it showed up.
---
Should be deep path now, you can always check the wiki before heading in too: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aquatic_Ruins_Fractal#Walkthrough
---
Okay satan
---
So, the player base decides to force the trinity into a game by introducing meta and BIS and rotations etc...  and this is all the devs fault.
---
That exposed chest tho
---
I made and only wasted 3 hours today because I wasn't able to find people.
---
Bl keys are getting utterly worthless.
---
Don't be a creep.
---
Here is my unpopular opinion.  The meta was built by people who were used to the trinity so they rebuilt it as best they could.
---
What happens when players expect there to be roles for each person is that builds develop to be good at one thing and one thing only.  While if organized this usually creates a stronger team, as all the weaknesses from going all in on a build are outweighed by the benefits multiplying over the rest of your team, in the pug world it isn't very useful.  The meta makes some builds critical to a group so yeah the boss cannot be killed without them.  If everyone is full DPS the skill level required of the entire team is too high to be expected out of the average person.  (Guaranteed one person on your team doesn't care if you lose)  Additionally if everyone is playing support and tank builds the boss never takes any significant amount of damage.  GW2 allows quick build changes out of combat that, if people wanted to, allows them to adapt to the group's skill level and play style.  However, the big word in there is "wanted".  Not many people actually want to log in, talk to new people, and coordinate a team build every time they play.  Humans love habit.  We love to know what we are getting into for regular play.  So yeah in my opinion it really is just that we are using an open system to try to recreate the traditional one because we like the old system.
---
Why do you keep making new accounts to make the same kinds of shitposts tho?
---
Eh, MMOs just have to adapt. UO died when people who didn't want to be ganked and looted got EQ as an option. EQ died when people who don't want draconian punishment for dying got WoW as an option.
---
WoW managed to adapt with LFR and such, a lesson games like FFXIV took to heart, but somehow gets repelled by the innovation smithy that is Anet.
---
MMOs are fine. They learn that you can't force player to play a certain way, they just won't play at all. It's the game designer's job to make the different movements within their playerbase co-exist.
---
[Options](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Options) &gt; [Graphics Options](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Options#Graphics_Options) &gt; [Advanced Settings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Options#Advanced_Settings) &gt; Effect LOD. Turn that option on and you'll limit the particle effects, will help with some of the skill spam. Lots of other graphics options you can tweak too if you need like Postprocessing  and shaders but that has effects on other aspects of the game. Also speaking of condi soulbeast there are actually some new builds and options being benchmarked including [34k stance share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rj50-4dWs) and [36k OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOndsRqSB4) (build links in the descriptions. Also for fractals specifically check out [dT's power soulbeast build](https://discretize.eu/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast) or even [Snowcrow's power raid build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/power/).
---
This is no reason for the game to be so badly organized. Some players can adapt to everything but it means nothing. Game should be consistent.
---
Pixel 3 a
---
Imagine not being the blueprint for how people feel about a thing. Humbling.
---
Charming.
---
The build that the player can operate well will always be well performing. Good player can beat any amount of people who copied their build from some website. Meta builds usually expect certain team compositions and if something is off by tiny margin, the performance sharply drops. In such situation good player knows what to adjust , and even if it diverges from meta, the performance can increase.
---
I think I / you missed the reference to [Radiohead Creep](https://www.songfacts.com/lyrics/radiohead/creep).
---
My point still stands. They could've poured in some more assets, expanded the instance map, hidden a few collection items here and there, and hello, a raid wing is done. Personally I LOVE wing 4 for its heavy lore and overall intricacy, yet I wouldn't mind a bit less if that means more frequent raid releases. I'm asking a rhetoric question of why Anet refuses to not halfass stuff.
---
Ah, I see. Sorry, I genuinely thought you're serious.
---
Sense of pride and accomplishment, but unironically. It's a thing.
---
Just because you are scared to go out of your comfort zone to achieve something, doesn't mean the good feelings that come from achieving that something are not worth it.
---
Being bad on purpose at something you love makes no sense, you'll never enjoy it as much as if you felt that you are progressing. That goes for games, drawing, cooking, sports, and everything in life.
---
It happens. I was hoping you and I would do all of the verses together but, it just wasn't meant to be.
---
Imagine people not playing computer games for their sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
90% ppl will kick any non-meta player,even if hes better than someone who plays meta (badly). Its just way of things in this game.
---
I really hate them jacas. Aggro so easily and they're so damned dangerous.
---
Well duh. Monthlies were never intended to keep you busy a whole month.
---
Iam not arguing with you about needing specific support characters and some extra for specific mechanics in raids.
---
But the part with the 10 different characters each with their own stats is nonsense. A regular dps needs nothing but ordinary exotic berserker armor, which you can get for sub 20 gold from the trading post, Runes and Sigils, also cheap from the trading post, an ascended weapon or two, which you get from specialization collections, or the thorn story part, and trinkets, which you can farm in a couple of days on LS3 maps.
---
The Support classes need different equipment, which can be easily bought from raid merchants after you started raiding a bit. You also get a full set of armor after beating the first three raidwings, for free.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you, and your friends, are really interested in raiding join Crossroads. The gear above and the will to listen to you commander is basically the only thing they ask for.
---
They gave up on macro geography some time around PoF.
---
because ANet never managed to hire anyone who can design encounters for that sort of game play
---
Ok, reply to this honestly.
---
If you come across something in the game that you fail the first time, like a JP, an adventure, a Hero Point, whatever...
---
And then you try a second time, and the experience from the first fail helps you beat it, does that not feel good to you?
---
It was forced by the content difficulty. They weren't clearing with 5-6 people on day 1. I do sorta agree with OP though, I was ok with Anet doing away with the trinity but what we got instead was worse.
---
She's got a "wolf" pack!
---
the worst pun, ill excuse myself
---
ah, those were the good ol days
---
my OP = my Original Post
---
For fuck's sake.
---
Queeeen
---
Lemme know how that extra, vitality saves you from a game entirely designed around heavy hits and active defenses.
---
Why does it feel like the rewards get worse each day? Lol?
---
Oh yeah I know from how many times I hang out in AC helping new players that there is a disconnect between the game design and the player expectation for classes.  There comes a point where you feel like you are "breaking the system" and you hope they don't patch your build to death.  RIP chronos.  Ironically this makes me feel like we're all being forced to not play how we want, which is bad design.
---
&gt; Feel free to ~~leave~~ **leaf** your constructive criticism, questions, and highlight any discrepancies I may have left.
---
FTFY
---
This is my main complaint.
---
I keep wondering if it's all that same cat who had the 60 accounts that got banned from the game since they keep bringing up, for lack of a better term, "wedge issues".
---
I mean, if you have the time to make 60 accounts to cheat with you have the time to spam Reddit.
---
I loved monthlies so much! I was so hyped and motivated to finish them all super quickly and get all these ach points and stuff
---
I actually dont remember what the other reward is
---
since that passage was wrecked by Bangar's people and then the Icebrood Construct I think it might kill some people...!
---
LOL!!!  It doesn't take much to see the bigger e-dick foreign policy theory at work.
---
Meantime this game was announced totally opposite...
---
Well if you're doing dailies that alone is 56g. I use the home nodes from ls3 and 4 to get the magics to convert into gold too. Alt accounts are definitely worth it imho

i don't want this new build templates at all. give me back the old ones where they automatically change your build based on pvp, pve, or wvw
---
It can become a grind, some days I don’t mind it, others it’s like meh, but good money though
---
you can still move from map to map on foot in all of the pof maps except for thunder head. there is even a boat you can take for istan.
---
Well that's not really possible these days and this chapter is currently free for everyone
---
I’m happy with rubis announcements! She’s gets me excited! #THICC CHOYA QUEEN!
---
I miss those. I remember going to Caledon Forest market and reviving lots of allies in the water. :)
---
Raids. Every single time I hear that I've to make something else. Power dps. Condi dps. Tank. Healer. Bannerslave. Kiter. Boonstriper. Solo lamp. Another kiter. Pusher. Another condi / power dps. Another healer.
---
I feel you’re frustration! I felt the same way when I started raiding. Best of luck to you! I hope you find a decent guild or group that isn’t too toxic! I’m still searching lol! :&gt;}
---
I’m assuming your main is a thief or necro?
---
They're a right pain in the ass, but the trick, if it's available, is to just AoE nuke them the moment you kill the twister. You get a couple seconds after the twister breaks to take them out before they do their little flippy jump thing, so you can just wreck them. Failing that, they'll always initiate with that attack, so just try to dodge it. All three should try at once, and fail if you dodge.
---
I every single mmo I was playing only as my main character. And I was able to achieve everything.
---
It's not random. Every class people list as meta for a fight is for a reason. It's not random that boon thief only works on 3 fights, there's a very specific reason why it only works on 3 fights.
---
You can kill bosses with everyone being hybrids. People have just found more effective ways to play the game. Besides, it's hardly this strict meta anyways. A source of full boons for the party, enough heals, and DPS that makes sense. That's not really asking for too much.
---
Now you're just making things up. But hey, if you want to be one of those guys, go for it. I have played a ton of MMOs, and nearly every one has bosses gated by raid or dungeon content. If you played them all, then you either beat the bosses by raiding, or you're a liar.  \*shrug\*
---
You can really just reduce it down to just needing power and condi DPS. If you can do those two things, you can fight every boss in the game. Even if it's something off meta like cdps Daredevil. If you do it well, no one will kick you.
---
[removed]
---
That was the only time I ever got a precursor in game (besides buying outright).  I remember almost crying when I got it.  That was back when the hammer was worth about 600 gold too.
---
Okay then you should have no problems here.
---
Old MMOs where much more strict about what classes are viable. In this, literally every class is viable. Just cause you play one class, and a group only needs something like a healer, doesn't mean you can't play the game. You just don't have a spot in that group right now.
---
&gt;Yeah, I'll just bend over so you can reach in and pick any answer that suits you.
---
Great excuse there.
---
I mentioned it back then; they wrote themselves into a corner.
---
It reminds me of this popular radio novel from my country, back in the old days. This psychic hero is thrown into a pool full of sharks and he has no way of getting out. The show ends in that cliffhanger, and the audience was excited. The writter had no effing idea how to get him out of there; he had the idea of the cliffhanger, but didn't consider how it would continue from there, as the hero had no abilities that would let him out, and by the next show, the cliffhanger is resumed with "Our hero swims with vigor to the shore and makes it out!". 
---
Suffice to say, it was a dissapointment.
---
Mmo's I played: Ultima Online (Mostly roleplaying), Ryl (top player), Runescape, World of Warcraft (a lot of realm first kills).
---
but why?
---
[But you need not fear me, champion.](https://youtu.be/cSD2aXhfCIE?t=79)
---
Okay buddy
---
I doubt we'll get two story paths, but I could see elite specs being themed around our bonds with Aurene, The Spirits; and Jormag if we end up allying with it. Aurene's undying crystal magic for necromancer, an icey Elementalist, a Ranger or Guardian channeling the spirits of the wild, etc.
---
Power Thief. I love min-maxing and I love raiding. I don't want to be carried by others. I wouldn't be happy with playing something useless or just not that good as it should be. Game should allow me to do this on my main character. As every other game does...
---
REASONS.
---
I don't think it should be split in two story paths either, but rather be one story path and at the end you can keep the elite spec like any other. Or if it's a class, give the player the choice between keeping the new class or return to his original class (it would be possible to create new toons with this class though).
---
Is this another one of those *"I main longbow ranger (for of RP reasons), why can't I raid/fractal at range with my longbow?"* threads?
---
You'd think with all the fashion, we'd at least have a pair of shorts for guys. I ran through the hot steamy jungle with a coat so heavy, Victorian guys would call me a prude.
---
Maybe something to do with them destroying the bridge in the prologue, so we just heli over instead
---
&gt; I would not mind having to pay for GW2 again
---
Careful what you wish for, remember ~~templates~~ loadouts.
---
ur're telling me there's a wvw team? because i kinda doubt that heavily. must be rather 1-2 persons that sit together each month once and drink several  bottles of some hard liquor, then decide to change nothing.
---
or they decide to lure pve'rs into it by introducing a warkitty, which is not very useful for the most parts of wvw. the newbies likely get ganked 50 times before they realize whats going on, that's likely not fun for them.
---
or think about re-introducing tournaments for wvw with rewards finally again. but you forget things fast with enough promille i guess.
---
or they laugh about how EotM has unique models and setting but is even more pointless to play than anything on the WvW-maps, bc there are no killpoints. this might be debateable surely, since you get literally no rewards for beeing tier 1 in the wvw ranking, which is super disappointing.   
---
they could even just close one alpine border (that stuff is just a copy of the other alpine BL...) and remodel EotM to a ranked map.  
---
\_\_\_
---
still, they missed out that wvw won't get people without proper and adequate rewards. also unqualified statements like "it's designed for and balanced about 50 versus 50 player fights" is such bonkers... even in tier 1 servers, these are the freaking exception and mainly happening on weekends. bigger zergs of 30ish ppl are far more common, often its just roamergroups sniping smaller roamergroups -  or one blob steamrolling till it gets slowly clouded and picked up one after another.
---
Marjory and Kas are starting to feel a bit like dead weight at this point. If I'm being forced to guild with these people, I want guildies who aren't going to disappear for a year when they get upset.
---
No. This is totally off the mark. You can go through every raid boss with the same character with the same build. You might be less efficient and more of just an extra body but you still can do it regardless. And if people kick you for off meta, find a group that doesnt care. Ultimately saying you "need" 10 characters is flawed. A guard, warrior, mesmer, ranger, and ele can all be used efficiently by themselves to multi slot into at LEAST 3 different roles
---
Aha, and i want 10k gold.
---
Spoiled child.
---
Ok.
---
I've killed every boss in the game with the same character. Not sure why that's a major fixation. Actually killed every boss with multiple characters at this point. My question: are you refusing to adapt from power thief to run boon/heal thief for the bosses it's good for, or deadeye for what it's good for, or condi dd for the few bosses it's better for. If you're stubbornly refusing to change a build on one single character and want to beat everything, its gonna be harder. But going off on a tangent about "needing" 10 characters at least is beyond flawed
---
Don't you guys have word suggestions above the keyboard?
---
And each of it will cost 2000 gems :-O
---
i don't understand the aversion to the desert BL map tbh. when i came new to wvw, i rather was confused by the two copies of alpine BL. i only can comment about this from view of our server; when we have desert homeBL, we hold it the same as each other homeBL. (we rarely to never are red though)
---
as i wrote above, i'd rather close one alpine BL and remodel EotM into a rated BL.
---
plus better rewards for wvw match victory. (erm, actually ANY rewards would be a thing to start with)
---
idk if strikes become a real thing. they're fun, but not necessarily hard. some openworld pve metas are harder than strikes lol.
---
Let's not forget all of the loose plots that are just dropped and never mentioned again. 
---
* Who is E? 
---
* Is the Pale Tree still dying and we don't care anymore? 
---
* What about the Mad Soul in GW1 who predicted that Kormir would kill the other gods to start the cycle again? 
---
* Did we give up on clearing the ghosts from Ascalon?
---
* Why did Balthy have Lyssa's mirror?
---
* What's the purpose of the reforged shadowstone / krait oil?
---
* Where did Lionguard Lyns go during the Battle of Lion's Arch?
---
Introducing mechanics that require a role (tank) leads to the necessity of bringing at least one tank. Going a step further, having more damage threat means actual healers have to be present. DPS still is relevant because the boss has to somehow die. Not sure how the trinity in GW2 is just people trying to revive a habitual set up from other games
---
It's a bit too intense just for seeing a couple of characters idle-standing and staring back at you with an expressionless face.  
---
It would feel out of place
---
It's sad if they don't even have an internal roadmap, even if it's never intended to be shared with the wider public... something to keep them on track.
---
Or Ryland.
---
&gt; If ANet had given a preview of the template system early, we would have been able to point out how unfinished and unserviceable as it is now before it got released.
---
I got my free one from the gem store because.. well, it was free... but I haven't even clicked into it yet because I don't want it to succeed in its current form. It should be free like it was in GW1. Hell, considering GW2 was built from the GW1 codebase, the code was already there and they removed it.
---
Yes. Anet has no balance goal and only balances things after the players have figured the game out.
---
I can tell you that the endgame content would be much more accessable if there were properly designed roles. It doesn't have to be the holy trinity but anything where you can quickly create a setup with random professions that fill all roles without feeling like you are lacking something.
---
You can of course just go full DPS with some healing but if you are playing with inexperienced players you will WANT to have all buffs. And naturally players will try to optimize their setups to avoid failures because of non-optimal player skill. (Some players are also just bad mechanically and can't do better).
---
I think it's ridiculous that people just ignore this huge problem of this game. Of course it's not the only one but it is one of the bigger ones. I mean WHY do players use the meta, BIS and rotations? Because these players FAIL the content without it (or have a lower success rate). And since Anet doesn't design the meta on their own it ends up in this convoluted mess that turns off new players.
---
&gt; ... and paying for a very high-production trailer if they're just going to dump the game...
---
You do if it's a last ditch effort to save the company. Look how much marketing Square did for the original Final Fantasy when that game was literally the 'make or break' for the company. If they didn't get the word out about the game that company would have gone under in the 80s.
---
&gt;Soooooo, guess I'll have more money for drugs and hookers.
---
Pretty sure that also falls under the category of shiny skrit stuff 😅
---
actually, the lws3 hearts aren't hard to fill, but not many people play those maps usually i think.  
---
i likely the designed of them (just bought them at the recent sale) but i couldn't imagine going through it without my skyscale... that must have been a severe pain.
---
Had this issue today, it only worked at the top level of the astralarium at a very specific location around the beam of light. I just ran around the beam of light spamming \[F\] until the dialogue appears... Wonderful.
---
To be realistic, game directors / publishers will scrap things for time or budget reasons. It may be a super engaging story (doubtful) that redefines the genre, but it is just as likely it may cost 10 times the current budget to realize it. Narrative directors have some control over a game, to an extent, but do not have absolute power to add things in.
---
Yes, that's why they think everything should be easy and that raids were a mistake.
---
Entitled toxic casuals.
---
Honestly I would if I saw a reason for it. Gear templates freed up 40 slots, I bought 2 or 3 bag slots with gold before that gear templates were announced, I got the ecto gambler item and a copperfed and the game mostly drops unidentified gear now.
---
I will be doing the strike mission and an essence chest run as often as possible in preparation for the potential grind collection at the end of the saga. I just finished the restored boreal collection and already have 1000 hatched chilli stored.
---
It's too much.
---
Like it's a slapper, but it's in the same essence as having a mudcrab aggro to you and the epic Skyrim fight music comes on... It ends up making it feel kinda lame.
---
sub classes p2w, lolwhat?
---
&gt; What we've had so far has been a new low for the company
---
Even lower than that ill fated Quizno's promo?
---
I come back every so often to do the living story episodes for a day or two and then go off to play other games.
---
It's definitely too intense for the login screen. I'd like to see it in more places but for something you experience every login it will get grating very quickly. 
---
I think a slightly ominous but more ambient piece will be best.
---
The problem when you make everything so easy is lack of depth, lack of innovation, lack of engagement. You can't make exciting gameplay and at the same time easy for anyone to do by spamming autoattacks.  Anet made the game too easy which means it becomes boring, fast. The moment you turn the game into a "fan service" the game dies.
---
Kojima, the mastermind behind dark souls, sekiro, metal gear solid etc etc read a lot of complaints from casuals about the extreme difficulty and the inability of some players to complete content at all. His reply was along the lines of "Im not gonna compromise the quality and depth of the game just so players can complete it, the mechanics,depth and difficulty are what make a game interesting and replayable". 
---
This guy has balls, a true developer and no matter what the critics say every single of his titles have been super successful simply because he is uncompromising. Anet are the opposite of this, they compromise at the first hurdle and have turned the game into a fan service in order to please even the lowest common denominator that plays 2h a week but still feels entitled to any and all rewards.
---
Can confirm. Am Linux user. 
---
(I have a bar at top and bottom)
---
You must use Ubuntu. They're about the only ones I know who put it on the side.
---
Yeah, I just didn't have enough time to get to mobs on some events or wait long enough to iWarden end (well, if mobs die before it can hit them, then it's def dps loss or sometimes you just won't be able to tag something), so I went GS and never looked back (not really true, but same situation as in case with shield; I like to use iWarden on chaks before and mid Gerent).
---
I go with runes of the pack and in practice you get perma-fury if you have some diviner pieces, so I never bothered to min-max with duelling because of that. Also, double iBerserker is so nice (and fast) to tag multiple mobs (and transferring boons). Also, even on stronger mobs more clones = more alacrity = more everything.
---
Ofc, if only tagging is important (like in Mad King's Lab), then pMirage with sigil of stamina (iirc) is better than almost anything else.
---
Nice first step, so what about two through twenty?
---
There are good dragons too like Glin, Albax and Kuunavang. My money is Jormag is neither good nor evil, but somewhere in the middle.
---
Bangar blew up the bridge, tho
---
And you still dont need all classes. Every class have build that most people will find useful in instanced content, even necro. Sure there are some elitist that whine "35k+ dps or kick" but they are more speedrunners than good raiders.
---
One thing you need to understand is that your main is a Thief, not a *power* Thief. Thief is able to take most kiting positions if you know what you're doing, solo the lamp, run condi, and even situationally act as a boon support/healer/tank. You also have access to a surprising amount of utility including excellent mobility (which makes you a good volunteer for some mechanics), projectile hate, portals, and huge breaks. The game allows you to do this by virtue of having multiple types of gear and specializations available to your class so you can set yourself up for different situations.
---
Obviously some things will be harder than others. If you aren't willing to use the right tool for the job (some classes are better suited to certain fights), then accept that you're making it harder on yourself. If all you want to do is an afk power dps rotation on every fight, then I don't have a lot of sympathy since your class can do *so much more*.
---
The only real exception is Twins. Mirage is *still* ludicrously overpowered and probably twice as good as the next best class on that fight. This, however, is a balance issue that, while relevant on multiple fights, is only really a dealbreaker on one. With that said, if you get a static and prove to them that you're one of the best Thief players on the market, they'll probably let you run it on Twins anyway.
---
That's what I mean, why don't then chose the correct words?
---

Oh hey! I know you too!

You're very naive then, that's all I can say.

Queue another 500 posts about the end of the world.
---
Removing monthlies and reducing the amount of AP you could gain from dailies is still in my book the worst change GW2 ever made. Now anyone who's new and wants to go AP hunting has no choice but to spend years on dailies before they have a chance to catch up to established players.
---
Oh give me a break already... This is getting sadder by the day.
---
And some of us sitting at 10 k games ...damn
---
Yes it’s killing me. I’m poor and I share ascended trinkets across characters and the templates make it a pain in my butt.
---
Anet didn't make the decisions about the layoffs NcSoft did.
---
Join a chill guild that does raid training. I am in a guild that accepts everyone into the squad, even meme builds. We sometimes run with no druid, only alternative healers, and never have a chrono (but Alacren or Healren and QFBs). Obviously it's not optimized but we don't care what the timer says when the boss eventually goes down. It can be fun playing in a off-meta squad, but also frustrating, depending in the boss
---
Or the last dragon is a wurm and every wurm is a corruption.
---
AHAI
---
We could kill Braham. That's brilliant.
---
If your main character is a guardian, with the current balance we call that "meta".
---
\*sigh\* Man even I can't come up with a way to keep things positive after this. Waited 7 years to finally get to Jormag and it looks like things are falling apart just when it starts...
---
ArenaDead
---
you can also move from map to map in HoT.
---
reason is pretty simple and has already been stated in the comments: those are expansions, which are delivered as a whole. so a player that owns the expansion has also unlocked all the maps that come with it.
---
with bjora its the same as with any other LW3 and LW4 map. you have to go back to core tyria after each map to make sure the players that haven't unlocked the previous episode can get to the new one aswell.
---
Lws4 and this saga feel so disconnected from everything around them. I wish you could just walk there.
---
I have the money to play any game I want. I have enough money to play ALL the games if I wanted. I've done pretty well in life. 
---
I play this game because I want an MMO and out of all the MMOs I've tried and researched this fits my criteria for an MMO better than any of the others.  ESO would be second and TSW would be third.
---
You don't care. You don't like the game. That doesn't mean no one likes it.
---
But I already have permanently encumbered inventory on every single character I have...
---
the road to Bjora goes through the Grothmar Strike Mission. And the bridge is out.
---
The devs did not start leaving until after the layoffs, which were caused by NCSoft intervention likely based on income figures.  Once that bombshell hit, those that remained apparently starting trying to line up other gigs, and now some have found their own next episode.
---
I had Internet connection issues after a win10 update, turns out a driver related to ethernet connection hadnt been updated.
---
Check your drivers?
---
I am using the reddit app and the standard keyboard, no extras.
---
Ngl the format of your reddit looks horrible.
---
Someone guess that Raids have been transformed into strike missions...
---
The places where your stats will matter in PvE (fractals and raids) are where you want to be capping crit and taking buffs into account. In open world it won't matter (you could even hold on to your gear and put it in your second equipment template to swap to). You can see the [meta fractal weaver build](https://discretize.eu/builds/elementalist/power-sword-weaver) as well as the [meta raid builds](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/sword/). Some things to note with the gear differences: Fractals expect you to have the bonus stats from potions there by the time you reach tier 4 and that gives precision so you need less of it (225 of it with 150 AR, higher AR means more stats too), raids will have access to druid's spotter (100 precision), which you usually won't find in fractals. So in general I'd suggest gearing the raid build and being slightly over cap in fractals. Use [this guide to help with gearing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) too.
---
Moving onto Guild Wars 3?!?... 😭
---
maybe ppl in ANET need to actualy work to work,so they leaving? :D
---
Weirdos.
---
Hammer attacks from across the map were an experience.
---
Obviously, i wasn’t really expecting an answer :P
---
I'm glad, most if not all artistic devs from Anet are crazy talented, having them move on to better jobs is something I wholeheartedly support.
---
The only thing you're "forced to create alts" for are crafting professions and achievement points. That's it. Just because some flavor-of-the-month class can out-benchmark you, doesn't mean you're forced to play that class or go home.
---
both of you #getGud?
---
noooo not him, he was a treasure 🍆💦
---
I'd rather have old Eye of the North theme back.
---
They’re perfect for Druids
---
How did people clear raids in early HoT with random group compositions and nowhere near as much powercreep as there's nowadays?
---
You can kill bosses with 8 berserker daredevils and 2 cleric/magi scourges in all exotics and it doesn't get more braindead (and easy af to gear up) than that so skill has nothing to do with ability to clear raids.
---
Nothing wrong. The best way to do it is play an unniversal class which can fill multiple roles, like guardian (dps, condi dps, healer or quickbrand).
---
You can play ranger, because druid is needed everywhere.
---
Or mesmer. It can be power dps, condi dps, tank chrono, supp chrono.
---
Elementalist — power weaver, condi weaver, heal tempest.
---
Revenant — condi revenant or alarene.
---
Warrior — BS, power or condi.
---
But if you stick to the single role with single class/character (e.g. thief as power dps), it can be... very difficult to find group that would take you to every raid boss (SH, Cairn).
---
But everything outside raids can be beaten with every class.
---
Copters? Kasmeer portals? Gliders? 
---
Honestly the "bridge is out" problem in GW2 universe has many solutions.
---
I don’t understand why are you upset? They all had missteps and they are doing great now. The same happens to GW2 they have missteps but the future is looking bright!
---
That thing 100% always visually bugs in my game every single time without even using build templates.
---
Yeah, spending 2 hours every 3 months pressing "F" and "1" is so much more fun than Raids.   /s
---
Changing nameplates has little impact on gameplay
---
Or like that mental illness where you're clearly in denial, and obsessively try to defend something
---
We all knew that alliances were 1 man project. When there's just one dev working on something there's less chance of something like this happening.
---
And the scouting team is sent to look for another way up and runs into Icy and finds that the blizzard is still strong. I don’t know if you are familiar with this, but typically you avoid mountain passes in a blizzard. Following Bangar over the mountains by that way would be extremely dangerous. That’s why the fly to Jora’s keep only when almorra sounds the all clear
---
&gt; Nope I think we will trust Jormag to kill another dragon but in that way we super charge Jormag.
---
I really like this take. Jormag with their powers and ours kills Primordus, does sucky sucky to the magic and then goes rawr Xd so we have to take them out while being much stronger. 
---
We do know Jormag and Primordus are each others weaknesses so it makes sense one would want the other out of the picture so as to avoid death.
---
I don't feel challenged by current strike missions. If a group of randoms tried it for first time and they didn't get wiped — it's easy. Something's missing there.
---
I honestly can't tell if you are being serious or forgot to add the /s. Hopefully you just forgot to add the/s or else you are incredibly delusional or a troll.
---
So you weren’t being sarcastic? Jesus dude you are deluded if you think anthem fallout 76 and andromeda are in a good state
---
Colleagues and friends get the axe, people are less motivated to go to work.
---
Replace this jackal with a Sylvan Hound. It would be perfect.
---
Skyscale could use the look of that tree-dragon we saw in the Dream and LS2.
---
And this right here ia part of why the game  is taking hits. Whiny kids that want to press 1 button for ez loot blaiming an excelent addition to the game because he himself is so terrible he cant press more than 1 button to play
---
You got it all wrong, you only press 1 once because it's an auto attack! /s
---
I didn't realise which dev this was until you said this
---
Oh look, the toxicity people claim comes from raiders. How interesting.
---
Of course it's sarcasm.
---
Nobody really believes that alliances will be released. At least not before 2022 and than it's too late.
---
They still haven't explained why they went full character assassination on Balthazar, have they?
---
Ah, the toxic casual and a fine specimen on top of that
---
Imagine just wanting challenging content immediately being elitism, lol.
---
I'll say it again, the table is the shit they aren't working on, the whiteboard is. We saw in the background of one of the pre HoT videos that they had things they were working on on on the whiteboard, and a table filled with stacks and stacks of paper was behind the whiteboard, in the same room.
---
“working as intended” is not an excuse for a badly implemented design. 
---
&gt; the building collapsed killing 3 people! 
---
&gt; yes, but it was designed to fall over. Working as intended. 
---
It just doesn’t really cut it as an excuse lol.
---
It would not have been difficult for ArenaNet to create a simple text file reader and writer like they did in GW.
---
Monthlies... two hours of playing reset in wvw and they were done, lol.  
---
In pve, monthlies did help me to get better at doing jumping puzzles though. I was absolutely terrible at them, even the easiest ones took me forever. So I had a few easier jumping puzzles I always did for those monthlies and with time I got better at them. (I'm still far from good at them though.)  
---
Sometimes I feel a little bit nostalgic when I am doing one of those easier jumping puzzles now, thinking about how I struggled with it every month for the monthly achievements.   
---
But I don't really miss them to be honest. Yeah the nostalgia is nice thinking about them. But to me they were somewhat irrelevant as a wvw player, and a chore for the pve ones. The AP was nice though.
---
As people said already, Strike missions have potential which hasnt been reached yet. In their current state they are nothing more than a world boss that you can fight whenever you want with pathetic rewards (looking at bjora marches one). Hopefully this gets better soon.
---
It is completely beyond me how ignorant the majority of the playerbase towards the current development issues. It is the concensus that as long as we get Living Story patches every 3-4 months there is no point in complaining. Hell, a certain guy posted that he/she does not understand the complaints about Raids and Fractals becuase if you are into these types of content then you should play another game mode until a Raid or a Fractal gets released. This is mindblowing to me. I see these types of content as endgame although due to work I cannot play them regularly anymore but it doesnt matter. These are archetypes of content that drives any MMO further that allows the so-called LADDER to be present which gives a new player a thing to look forward, offers a steady improvement scale that you can climb and at the end you go from completing autoattacking open World events to I don't know doing orb duty on Dhuum or covering a pylon at Qadim. If these things are being neglected then it hurts the game as a whole even if you are not playing that specific type of content. I don't play WvW, but it is one of the best game modes in an MMO in theory. I would never play it but it was a beautiful thing if Alliances came because it'd expand the game and the community. If you ignorant towards Raids that's ok, but ask youreslf: is it normal that we get 1 Raid and 1 Fractal a year? Is it normal that the WvW community has been bleeding out for ages now? Is it normal that PvP is hardly touched for many years now? Is it normal that every endgame type of content just get abandoned (Dungeons, Bounties, Raids)? Just because you don't cater towards a game mode that does not mean that they should be forgotten about. Hell, I don't like the living story as a concept but I play it every patch and if there's something good about it I'm not hesitant to say it.
---
Hey i'd be OK with gw3 after icebrood.
---
You're confusing cause and effect. The game modes were neglected *because* not enough people were playing them *ever* to justify significant development. They *did* try, there have been tons of balance patches, attempts at some tournament structure or reward pool that would draw players in, that whole inventory merging thing they did fairly early on, they certainly *tried* to make fetch happen. Fetch isn't happening.
---
Not like EAnet actually has a roadmap to show, and even if they do have one then its somewhere on the table but they can't find it anymore.
---
Currently the only known future is Icebrood Saga with its story content. No future for raids, fractals, pvp or wvw.
---
God no the game is not dead. There is a wealth of content for you to explore and enjoy!
---
Right now people are upset at the devs for not communicating what they are doing and we have no idea about future content. but tbh this kind of complaining comes when any fanbase is discontent.
---
It’s fun
---
&gt;on reddit
---
Found the problem.
---
Avoid reddit and enjoy the game, it's fine.
---
&gt; A few posts can still be found calling for an Armory (mentioned in the preview livestream as the devs' inertial name for equipment storage) by name.
---
The concept of an armory is quite interesting. For me personally, such an armory would need to fullfill:
---
* Storing Armor, Weapons, Runes, Sigils, Infusions
---
* Account Wide
---
An equipment template with such an armory could then link to the items in the armory.
---
It would also allow to easily share gear between characters, as the armory is account wide.
---
Removing an item from the armory should either
---
* de-link that item from each template or
---
* leave the templates as is. This would require to add an check on template-load if the item is still in the armory; and if not to skip loading that slot.
---
I'm not upset at the devs for not communicating enough. I'm upset because they have been straight up lying to us for months
---
Well said and its along the lines of what I keep saying about mmos needing to keep a variety of content alive.
---
The fanbase is scared...
---
2019 has been a rollercoaster for the game
---
if you are looking for Anet to give you the contents  like many other people here
---
then move on 
---
if you can make your own contents from the game itself then there should be no problem.   
---
there are still stuffs you can have fun by playing with friends and other people
---
things like pvp wvw have been the same for years  people who still play it    they already live with the fact that there won't be much update.
---
Anet made the decisions that led to NCSoft needing to step in and make much-needed cuts to put a stop to the cash flow that ArenaNet was straight up wasting with nothing to show for it.
---
You dont use f3 for "only" aegis mid dps rota. You use f3 for prebuffing  defensively, stab / resi / reflect / prot / ...
---
If only fb had access to blocks / aegis outside of f3...
---
LMAO, well done.
---
Why even try when you are bashed for anything you do....
---
not yet, but it probably wont get any more major expansions. slow fizzle to the end.
---
It's okay if you mentally close and lock the fact that at the moment there's no foreseeable future for the game.
---
Great... I was complaining to a friend about the state of the game, because nobody of mine plays it.   
---
He then asked me why don't I just forget about it I started telling him why I love this game and he actually became interested in checking out the living world, mounts, classes etc,..   
---
He downloaded the game last night. I told him how I still have some hope and shit, I get to work, make myself some coffee, linked him the build editor and PoF trailer, open the reddit and see this on top.   
---
HOW FUCKING PEACHY
---
We can get to broja marches via Grothmar chopper though?
---
&gt;https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bjora_Marches
---
&gt;Using the Vigil Chopper located upstairs to the west of the Great Hall point of interest in the Blood Keep of Grothmar Valley.
---
Bruh I'm slipping... I've been holding on for so long..
---
## bruh 💯💯💯😎😎
---
It basically means that the primary "team composition" cell is based about guilds. You create guild and make alliance with other guild, and you will be in same WvW team for next matchup. That way players have certain level of direct control who they are with. Still the system would put together also solo guilds and solo players to balance things, but towards certain limit, you can directly affect it. Also means that if you change your guild, it effectively changes your team for next matchup (matchup in terms of "world linking schedule", not week schedule). It would make guilds very important and it would ensure possibly better balancing of amounts of people. But many are sceptical to it, as many people don't care about balance, they just transfer to winning team to get free loot so it is impossible to balance...
---
Where would I be without you.
---
ok I would be super down for this
---
esp. if the next step is Jormag vs Primordus
---
legit for so long dragons have been treated like sacred mystical gods older than the earth itself and then the PC just shoots them with a gun and they die, no diplomacy, nothing. I'm so done with it
---
So cool things  coming meant the Living Team leader leaving Anet?
---
If next release is really in january-ish, then it will be that same small. That's how stuff works with 2 month release cycle.
---
The person i was responding to is the one that (unfortunately) decided to use the "mental illness" card.
---
Using it back at him was more of a personal dig than anything else. I obviously don't believe he's genuinely mentally ill.
---
I can do thinner hairs, and I agree the leaves do look a bit odd anyhow.
---
Thanks. =3
---
Yeah let's try not to be stupid anymore.
---
The ship is sinking and people who see this are leaving the company.
---
There is nothing else that awaits us after the Icebrood Saga. I hope they can still put the game into maintenance mode.
---
No specific name. Just plain denial   
---
"In the psychology of human behavior, denialism is a person's choice to **deny reality** as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable truth. Denialism is an essentially irrational action that withholds the validation of a historical experience or event, when a person refuses to accept an empirically verifiable **reality**."
---
The Mordrem one?
---
U wot.
---
There was literally a content patch a week ago :/
---
It's fair if people can't do it because of disabilities, but I'm not sure they'd have the gold. If they do, good on them. That being said there is plenty of players who never want to improve.
---
Pay attention to class!
---
Mate you literally gave some of the worst games today as examples. Almost all of them being very fucking dead...
---
We had this in some way in Heart of thorns when we fought Mordremoth. When you play a Sylvari you will switch sides for in the fight.
---
There is something each player will experience and every game developer has to address in one way or the other.
---
Jeremy Bernstein made a very interesting GDC talk about this back in 2014 on how to create string Game characters. The talk is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mgK2hL33Vw) if you are interested.
---
The thing he talks about are the following things:
---
* Unity of Action = What does the character do to get what he wants?
---
* Unity of Purpose = What does the character want?
---
* Unity of Trait = How the character seems!
---
So for example, If you play as Batman and you are confronted with the choice of killing someone then you have a bit of a problem. Batman is a character that doesn't kill people! (there are probably exceptions but just bear with me) So if now Batman starts killing people this would contradict what it seems and losing the Unity of trait. Now that wouldn't be so bad if the other Unities are fulfilled because Batman would want revenge or is controlled or whatever. The more Unities you lose with the character the more the Character you play won't fit into this narrative.
---
In GW2 this would get even worse because we have a very linear storyline with only a few differences or choices that have not really much of an impact on the story like back when we could choose who we align with, in PoF. IIRC there wasn't anything different after that choice other than getting the backpack banner.
---
With your idea, letting Jormag control or convince us to stay against our friends and guild, this would create a bit of a problem and disconnect to the character we play and the commander as a character.
---
ArenaNet has made the commander to an unbreakable object that can't be swayed and if Jormag suddenly does this then this would contradict the unity of trait. If a Player decides he aligns with Jormag because they want to be a Svanir you already have a disconnect between what the character the player is playing and what the commander as a character does.
---
This is actually a bit of a struggle I have with a few instances in the story, I play an Asura Character and there are a few dialogues in which "the commander" pretty much says "cut to the chase I don't understand you" when Taimi technobabbles. But my player character should understand this and even engage in this and maybe even point out errors in Taimis calculations but instead, my Asura behaves like a bookah.
---
Long story short, while I like the idea it has to be a choice to the player! My main character wouldn't be swayed by Jormag, that is how she is. But maybe a different character or some other player might want to be swayed! So instead of forcing it onto the player you would have to give them the choice.
---
And I can't see that happening even when your idea would pretty much the same "battle" just from two different perspectives.
---
Oh you know full well what I was asking for!
---
We wish m8..
---
Not bad ideas. If I do a second pass on Sylvari mounts I'll give that a go.
---
=O
---
Nothing needs to be happening, this is natural process. People move around, to get different experiences, to work on other projects....being in one job for more than 5 years is totally getting into your head and burnout syndrome starts to kick in. You can actually see the burnout even with players after this time period, they tend to be cynical and not really care about stuff anymore (see this sub). Even people in relationships tend to change partners in 4-5 years cycle if they have chance. 
---
The change is natural for humans, it is exciting, new stuff to do...boredom is real threat for a lot of projects. Positive side of things is that other fresh people will come in on those free spots and will bring in new energy.  That's just how it works.
---
Also have in mind, that we are in times when economics shakeup is possibly about to happen (some people really think that new crisis might arrive soon) and subtle signals of such are already around. For people that are already bored in their job, this time is good one to still find new job, once crisis arrives, they will be stuck with what they have....for years until it goes away. So if one is not happy now, it is best time to jump ships now.
---
No, game is not dead.
---
Not surprised by this. GW2 is a game where content is released about every 3-4 months and it's usually just living story or occasional expansion. As a dev I'd be bored if I only released content every 3-4 months.
---
Also at the people who still thought AreaNet would be working on fractals and raids. GW2 is a game for casuals and always will be for casuals.
---
New content for this game has been coming  out every 3 months for the last 3 months and the latest one just hit a few weeks ago. The community is tripping balls.
---
If you prefer PvE and story content, this game is thriving.
---
ANet vs Trinity, a flowchart:
---
* WoW has Holy Trinity
---
* Holy Trinity sucks because DPS gets to be cool and Tank and Support are bleh
---
* ANet makes all classes suck at healing and dodgeless tanking, gives every class buffs and dodges
---
* If every class does every role, DPS is the best role
---
* Best DPS is Greatsword Warrior
---
* If you are not GS Warrior, you cannot join our dungeon
---
* Warrior nerfed, Thief OP, if you are not D/D Thief, you cannot join our dungeon
---
* etc. etc.
---
* How do we make more than one class relevant at a time?
---
* AoE healers are back in, boonshare is back in. Now at least 3 classes are relevant
---
* Whoops Holy Trinity is back in

GW2 is now an ongoing struggle between allowing every class to do everything and restricting boons, mechanics, etc. to keep classes relevant. It's ok to have a Rock&lt;Paper&lt;Scissors meta if it means variation. But balancing unique mechanics is hard, when they suddenly become so required they're "meta". Warrior Banners, Druid, Chrono, etc. I think the solution is to just lean in and make 1/3^(rd) of the classes boonshare, 1/3^(rd) healers, and 1/3^(rd) DPS, but honestly, who's to say? ANet had values, it's easy to see where they went wrong. But it's hard to say where we should go next.
---
Pffft
---
Yeah, work slowdowns after a round of layoffs are a GREAT idea. That'll teach em.. to call the other guy back
---
I thought Living Story was monthlies since that's main content.
---
She uhh, wasn't around for the battle with Kralky.
---
We encountered her earlier on in LS3 and... well, she met the same fate as most creatures that are hostile to the commander do.
---
*babymad* Seeing this reminded me of my utter hatred and frustration at the Daily AP cap of 15,000 AP. I wish to hell ANet would increase that cap--even just 500 points a year or somethin'. Dammit! 🤬
---
Why do you have the task bar on top?
---
The beetle was the most natural idea; that is, it only took me a couple of seconds to figure out how it should look, whereas the others took time to figure out what would fit best, which probably explains why the others seem a bit off. I'm not used to working with plants so I'm not really familiar with the correct way to approach their design. 
---
But yes, the function of this piece, as with most of my GW2 concept art, is more intended to get people thinking about the designs and to provide ideas, rather than actually function as final designs.
---
What can go wrong?
---
Go into the game, look, around. You can see for yourself if it's dead. Reddit hasn't reach any consensus at all.  A large contingent of hard core players definitely think it's going that way, and they post more than everyone else combined.
---
If you're into the open world stuff, living story and new zones, you won't likely think it's dead. If you're into raiding or maybe PvP or WvW you might think it is.
---
My money is on it's not dead. Anyone can say anything they want, but this game isn't making less down than it did in the aftermath of HoT.  Any game making 12 million a quarter isn't dead.
---
as much as i love guild wars 2, this game will die in late 2020.  no chance they can entertain such a big playerbase with that little of content
---
why you referred china here
---
Curiouser and curiouser... Tell me... Why do you assume "elitist piece of shit" when the statement was pretty much correct? Story just gotta really hit 1 and F, and you can finish it..
---
I'm not really sure why people are surprised at this point...
---
Idk what was the straw that broke the camel's back but when a company has to lay off half it's staff nothing that comes afterwords is ever positive. 
---
People are going to say thinking this way is pessimistic. They are not wrong, but they are also still in denial, I've passed acceptance a long time ago. All that's left is a long and slow death...let's hope I'm wrong
---
It's not dead, this subreddit is just extremely toxic. If you say anything positive about the game you are considered a white knight.
---
its already too late. Guild are dead so no one will care for alliances, no guild drama, nothing. So it will be just like normal wvw but you will be randomly assigned to grupe of players. I personaly think its too late for everything. The only option would be gw3 and living world in gw2 for maintance mode (so exactly what we have) but they are not working on gw3 because all devs left.. So its just maintance mode without future
---
Someone saved himself aswell from this dead game im happy for him hopefully he will be successful in his life.
---
Except most World Bosses have an exclusive loot that has a lot of value. Dungeons still give exclusive rewards to this day, some are even used in meta builds (Monk/nightmare runes) or in Legendary crafting. WvW has its own Legendary backpack and Armor, plus other exclusive rewards (same as sPVP you mentionned afterwards).
---
I don't think Jumping puzzles have rewards that can be that good, but I don't consider JPs as a game mode, more like a side and enjoyable activity that hasn't a lot of gameplay in them but are still fun.
---
In the end, the important thing isn't about if the reward themselves immediatly suck, but about their exclusivity. Bonus point if they are long term rewards. 
---
Now on the other hand, fractals and raids aren't played as much because you need to LFG your way in. Or even harder for casual people, find a guild to do them with. You have to hard interact with people, and then, they are endgame, somewhat hard content, and you have to do more than just pressing one and seeing the mobs melt. Hell, even sPVP falls in this description. These gamemodes aren't less populated because of the rewards but because of the mental barriers most of the playerbase keeps on hiding behind.
---
Raids made the game measurably worse. Outside of raids, you can still play the game as originally intended though.
---
The most we can hope for now is for a company to buy out the IP and manage it properly
---
weren't first the dungeons?
---
Like how baby Lemurs travel around on mommy's back, only instead of Lumurs it's giant war kittys, and they're wearing heavy armour.
---
There was never a time in which you needed to be meta DPS to join a dungeon party. *Some* groups will inevitably be jerks, but you could never not find a group that was open to anyone so long as they had a vague idea of which end of the mouse to click.
---
Back in my day, we had 7 professions and 3 races.
---
maintenance mode soon boys, get ready :,(
---
I'll take either, just a little extra something we can do each week would be nice, even if it only take a few hours to complete.
---
The release will absolutely be the same size as ep 1. We know the size of Drakkar Lake based on [that_shaman's datamined post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dz3i7o/that_shaman_the_actual_map_boundary_of_bjora/). What we're looking at for this saga is pretty obvious. Previously: 1 ep 3-4 months, now: 0.5 ep in 2 months. Same amount of content but delivered faster. Hoping for anything else is setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
Yea and now I know I’m done here because I’m talking with a person that:
---
A- compares video games to relationships
---
B- doesn’t know how MMO are played 
---
C- uses Japanese for some reason 
---
But hey, I don’t expect much from people that settle for less, when even the CEO and lead devs left the company!
---
And it seems like another lead “living world” design just left today, awwwww. 
---
Reminder: don’t forget to buy gems, and set yourself a reminder to come back to this post when the game shuts down &lt;3
---
while you trying to save yourself for one year now but you still around
---
Dont speak about them, they are forgotten ;)
---
Well if something is not being developed, its still on the table till someone else picks this up ;)
---
Why do you think you are the only person in a raid group? Are you just triggered by LFGs that are 9/10 and search for a healer, and you join anyway on your power thief, and then go on reddit to complain that they didn't want you in their group and kicked you?
---
You basically make up the problem. I have a friend that only plays engineer. And he has killed every single boss in the game as a power Holosmith, with the eventual switch to condi. You don't NEED to do every single role in a raid for it to be successful. You improve your chance to find a raid group faster if you can do these roles, but it's not needed.
---
so where is reddit gonna hold his 500th dead game party
---
Because it's cheap to outsource to China.
---
I got baited, I'm dumb.   
---
Don't look...
---
Damned if I do, damned if I don’t? Guess I’ll go work on another game, one that doesn’t have such a rabid fanbase.
---
Mordrem are often just corpses moved by plants anyway, so a lot of Mordrem aren't actually corrupted beings.
---
Not to be a total downer, but the idea of this game not being in maintenance mode by 2022 seems almost unthinkable at this point
---
There are no breaks on the dead game hype train. CHOO CHOO!

---
Power thief has really good sustained DPS. It's more than viable for every power fight. DH just beats it out because it has a little better burst, which ends up being a little better when speed running, but even if speed runs are the goal, Daredevil is still a great choice.
---
Unless you mean that's the build you use. Well yeah, for condi bosses, condi is better. Daredevil has a condi build, it's not the absolute best, but benchmarks at like 32k. It's really easy, and really easy to hit that benchmark. Doing about 30k on a boss is never "being carried".
---
The way the build system works in GW2, any class can really do just about anything.
---
You are not the only one, look at the other replies and the downvotes he got. It's kinda sad how even this kind of shit gets believed as white knighting.
---
Keep in mind that not long ago the opposite was true and their community would hype GW2 to the heavens even for marginal or slow changes.
---
They soured their community goodwill, and frankly it's not something you can recover from in an existing game. Not really.
---
Fuck I just realized the same thing when I read both of your comments. NOT JASON!!!!
---
Casuals raid and play fractals.
---
You can, just not the way anet is doing it
---
Don't ruin their fun as long as they have one. There is huge amount to be get for new people that never seen stuff. Even for you, playing with them and teaching them about the game is the best endgame you can ever get in MMO.
---
If there's not enough players playing at the same time then the whole structure of open world breaks. There's a certain point where the game becomes unplayable and gw1 doesnt have that problem.
---
Chill Guys this is completely normal. /s
---
It leads to a cliff.
---
Its trying to solve a genuine issue (how do you divide people into servers in a way that is fair and fun for all sides and parties involved).
---
Presently, anyone can effectively swap to any team they like. Imagine a shooter with lobbies, where the teams arent balanced and anyone can swap to any other team for 10€. That's wvw.
---
Obviously people swap to the winning teams or teams that take care of pugs 24/7. This in turn means those succesful servers dont exist very long or become very bloated very quickly. No reason to try and be a good teammate or improve, just join the winners every few months.
---
Also leads to some fringe issues. Lets say you play off prime as a pug. Most servers don't have any comms or much activity off prime. You go to reddit and ask for a good server. They tell you x and y servers have activity at your time zone due to some guilds, lead or server preference. Over time - the system trends to avoid balance and promote stacking (atleast a certain timezone) rather than promoting even sides.
---
Alliances will try to divide players every 2 months, based on the alliance they choose to play with. An alliance will be essentially a group of guilds.
---
The issue is this doesnt even solve most issues, barely bandaids them. It will continue to group pugs with alliances almost randomly, every 2 months. It still wont promote balanced sides (no system in place that converges towards balance outside of ppt which is defunct).
---
Frankly alliances is anet saying "we can divide players into reasonable groups" when in reality, they cannot.
---
&gt; I just happy someone is calling them loadout slots.
---
As if that's not repeated ad nauseum on every single thread about build templates ...
---
As if they would tell us that. This is only based upon the lack of content updates we have received. The slowdown of content updates is very noticable for those who have followed the game.
---
Your math assumes that Anet's workforce consists entirely of software developers.
---
Huh, the icebrood has a cc phase, never noticed
---
why is this downvoted?
---
To be honest I doubt at this point that they will finish season 5. I think they don't even know what comes after episode 3.
---
Aren't there corrupted Wurms at Dragonfall at the death part of the zone?
---
Because anyone can join, press 1 to win and get a feeling that they completed the equivalent of a raid boss. Really loving how progressively easier this game is becoming...
---
Every bit of content that isnt living story has been axed entirely. I understand you dont SEE it, but that is still a you problem.
---
In that 9 month post hot period, the only thing that had drought was living story. We had development and releases / updates to hot. Yet you call it drought.
---
Yet 9 months between releases is a dream for literally everyone except living story. Living story which, spoiler, wont grow the game.
---
That is untrue. I mained a Thief most of the game, and had no trouble finding teams in LFG. Like I said, you would find "Zerk Warrior" LFGs on offer, but there were plenty of other teams on offer too. Finding a casual group that wasn't so picky was effortless.
---
Indeed! Imagine sucking at something you like on purpose.
---
Y'all still playing this game? This game already dying.
---
My guild is still active but no one expects that alliances is still in development. We are active because at prime time we still find fights and we like to talk about our daily life. But we lost a lot of good people the last 2 years.
---
I doubt they have one.
---
People are in denial.
---
The new one.
---
In that 9 month period we had PvP seasons and raids, and that was it. There was no new content besides raids. And I 100% guarantee you more people called that a content draught that what we have now. I agree raids and fractals and WvW and PvP don't get much attention.  Those formats are definitely in a draught. But that's no worse than the 9 months after HoT.
---
I agree.
---
Then let's skip directly to "And now genuinely imagine not using computer games to get their sense of pride and accomplishment.", shall we? But this time we'll only progress if you're actually willing to touch that subject.
---
I'm willing to bet most of the people I used to raid with that still play, play more casually than all these self proclaimed "casuals". After all only doing 3 hours of raidclear every week, at most, is pretty laid back.
---
You must be new to raiding.
---
Schadenfreude
---
If you want some easy condi build to play, go firebrand for nice burn or soulbeast.
---
Great? Andromeda is dead as dead a game can be, zero support, no updates.....nothing.There isn't even a team for it atm. Maybe 1-2 devs monitoring servers stability.
---
Fallout 76 has been a shithole since the start and even my brother who has played all fallout games religiously gave up on it. From the bugs,hideous optimization, greedy monetization... they now made an optional subscription for  people to rent "private servers" and after next year they will move to a full subscription model cause they dont actually make a profit anymore. Bethesda have given up on the game half a year ago and are just milking whatever little playerbase is left.
---
Anthem was the worst possible release of the last 5 years. Even the Lead left a couple of weeks ago saying "im sure the team is good and will provide good content " and all that PR bullshit.
---
within all the garbage items that the BLC can drop it's probably the only one that has an ocasional use. At least until a perma-revive orb is released.
---
Difference is, Firebrands have been doing this all along in WvW even when chronos were meta in PvE.
---
It is a good boss fight and at the same time it is easy. I have seen a lot of people dying because they were to lazy to move out of the aoe or to jump over the circle and then they were screaming for ress. Well, in the last 25%, if you try to ress you will be nuked, so no ress there. Very good content.. I love strikes.
---
And yet arc managed to provide templates that users were generally happy with.
---
Imagine one is designed with the needs of the players that want / need a template feature in mind. The other is designed to extract money from your wallet without regard for functionality.
---
This won't be a provlem for long time yet. Maps are still full and megaserver map will solve this problem. If they could add bots for filling party would be perfect
---
3 hours a day. Casual
---
I think that if they do something like GW2 Remastered where they re-release the game on a new engine with better graphics and improved optimization would better in the long run. At the moment new releases with better/new technology is hard to accomplish and some older content does not look as good as it used to upon release. It would take a ton of work and time, but it could actually be beneficial if the game wants to have a long future ahead.
---
Casuals are wiping at new boss in strikes . But hey . I hope all raids will be changed into strikes . The sooner the better
---
"People are in denial" 
---
No just you....
---
They can't even deal with the code base to make a decent template engine and you want innovative game play?
---
&gt;Ok, that can be your opinion. I disagree, at least for the time being. It's possible that when all's said and done I will agree with you that they did take the wrong course, but at the moment I can't agree to that, since we don't know where they are headed with it.
---
* Dungeons - long gone, officially dead
---
* Fractals - it's been a year, since the last one
---
* Raids - gutted high end community
---
* Guilds -Abandoned
---
* Ascended gear - not even necessary (except t4 fractals)
---
* Masteries - more and more specific to one map/region (not horizontal progression -&gt; because it's NOT character progression! it's only "map" progression and in the wrong way: making it easier, not harder
---
* PvP - no esport community since esl, secondary playmodes like stronghold and 2v2 never really supported (swiss not coming)
---
* WvW - no updates since HoT launch?
---
Meanwhile, new release:
---
* Among the smallest maps to date.
---
* Among the smallest stories to date.
---
* No new mechanic introduced
---
&gt; What about Infinity War and Endgame? 
---
What about them?
---
1.) Gw2 is not even remotely on the level of infinite war and end game. 
---
They aren't masterpieces by means obviously, but they have basic competence when it comes to their writing.
---
2.) Infinity war has a proper structure for a movie that give you an ending with enough answers and questions to hold you over.
---
3.) Marvel movies in general are a good example of this. They have an overarching story but they all hold as standalones.
---
4.) Infinity war and endgame are the end of a 15 year or so project and they have an extremely high standard for quality. Gw2 writers have said they don't even know what to do after this episode with the masteries.
---
5.) They can actually handle a character death, gw2 still struggles with that.
---
Gw2 is still struggling with basic concepts like "cause and effect", so stop comparing it with things that its not even close to and saying "Well they did it so gw2 can."
---
&gt;What about TV series that end on a cliffhanger, and then return in 3 months, or a year, or more?
---
Because usually the story itself in the season has some sort of closure to give you also again, its composed of several episodes instead of just a 30 minute long tidbit.
---
&gt;What about comics that only come out intermittently? There are plenty of forms of media in which they can leave a storyline unfinished for many months or years before picking it up, and often these projects are considered quite successful. 
---
Leaving a specific storyline unfinished does not mean they don't provide any sort of conclusion for the current story. Again, stop comparing gw2 to things its not even close to writing quality with.
---
&gt;And this episode had a three act structure, with a beginning (arriving and finding the fort), middle (finding the norn and charr), and end (fighting the shaman). What's your point?
---
"three act structure" doesn't mean "three big things happen" right.
---
If we're being generous the episode ends at the midway point. The confrontation with the shaman didn't give any resolution, to any conflict. That episode doesn't work as a standalone.
---
&gt;But the Raven Lock is a new ability. 
---
No its not. Pressing F to open a door is not a new ability. It does not function like a new ability and it serves no purpose of a new ability.
---
&gt;where Sheppard is given a link to the Reapers automatically at the beginning of the game, and this provides her with special insight into their behavior for the rest of the franchise. Many game heroes are just "handed" a certain key to unlock tasks that are automatic or trivial from their perspective, but impossible for the 99.9% of other beings in their world that do not have this trait.
---
In those games it doesn't cost a mastery to unlock that. Its part of the story and you just get it as a part of you character. Anet presented this as a mastery, not as a random pickup.
---
&gt;Again, I presented several examples of long arcs that take months, years, or even decades to fully play out. 
---
None of which are relevant for several reasons ranging from "They still have standalone value" to "They have an actual plan", to "Their writers actually know what they're doing." to "They actually give you a conclusion at the end of each part" to "They were actually planned".
---
&gt;I mean, what even are "stakes" in a game like this? 
---
For one lets start with the basics, making it so its actually possible to die in the open world would be a good one. Lets get that basic thing down and we'll see after that.
---
&gt;I call it "not bad design." Like I said, if the entire success or failure of this episode hinged on the Raven Bond ability,
---
I mean, the story was incredibly short and pretty bad by most writing standards, the map was tiny, no new mechanics were introduced, no legendary, fractal or raid, no balance, pvp, or wvw changes, literally nothing.
---
The episode doesn't seem to succeed in anything.
---
&gt;You can, but we don't even know if that will be the case. 
---
"The company has been fucking up nonstop for the past year, but we don't know if they will keep fucking up" is not an adequate defence.
---
&gt;I would rather that they be adaptive to player feedback 
---
Player feedback has been asking them for replayable content that is worth doing past first completion since season 3 and they've been ignoring it.
---
that's not quite how the math works out though. e.g. splitting a map into chapters requires more terrain wasted on artificial borders. that huge mountainrange in the west that serves for a nice landscap but actually just serves as a visual obstruction of the unreleased half of the map? that's not going anywhere.
---
putting out half an peisode every 2 months also means that the release cadence for a full episode worth is now officially stretched to *at least* 4 months, with two opportunities for delays instead of one. and then there is the tiny and unimportant fact that these release appear to be story and nothing but - no legendaries, no raids or fractals on the horizon, and no other updates/reworks either.
---
and i didn't even touch on the quality of the content the first half of the new map provides...
---
it's the thin layer of butter we got during S4, just even thinner and replaced with margerine.
---
Tha basic code monkey does not care if the game is in maintenace mode or else, he just has to deal with x shits each week. A leader can see where the project is going and if that's nowhere -&gt; his position is not worth shit.
---
maintenance mode coming closer and closer
---
Then make a group of likeminded people. No raid boss prohibits any class in the game.
---
Resources are already stretched pretty thin. You want to design say five new raptors? Five new skimmers? It's a lot of work for very very little payoff.
---
Who said anything about 3 hours straight? 
---
I often didnt make it from work in time for full clear. Others would leave before we were done. During the weekend we would have meme raids where we fill the bosses people still wanted or needed.
---
if your concept of being alive is gw1, then yes, gw2 will be alive any time soon.
---
What do you mean by "the event"?
---
Nothing surprising. Every normal and not delusional person already see that game is dying. And we already move on to other games. Are you going to lie to yourself even more guys? Accept the truth. You can downvote people which tells you the truth but its just childish. It won't change anything. Such a wishful thinking no matter.
---
Dry Top and the Silverwastes doesn't have the portal while sharing border and connection to Brisban W.
---
On the other hand, Kourna and Jahai weren't connected at first and portal was added later - so same situation may happen here as well
---
Amen
---
Remove envoy armor from raids. Pvers who do not raid deserve it.
---
I would like them to be designed for a race but usable by every race. Race exclusivity or racials for examlle just exclude content based on an arbitrary cosmetic choice.
---
But they are wiping . A lot
---
Well you can say that those in general do like to immitate other living beings (that's why sylvari have human shape) so looking like others is not very surprising in general there.
---
Some older bosses are already a problem, would be good idea to do weekly bonus rewards for killing bosses/events in certain areas
---
*Ya bring me something?*
---
You don't understand, people come and go from companies all the time! It's *perfectly normal* that the lead designer for the Living World is leaving right when ANet focuses the whole game on the Living World! /s
---
I think both can have it.
---
Don't you guys have a ray of hope?
---
What about guild missions?
---
Compared to dungeons, guild missions got recently updated, during HoT :P
---
There are some GW1 fans in the Path of Exile upper management, would be amazing if they did.
---
Dude, they already officially announced that they're not going to add new fractals or raids. What do you want more? They have to send letter with this information to you? Use your brain sometimes.
---
Point of view.
---
I prefer smaller maps
---
I prefer strike to raids
---
I love new map and the boreal weapons
---
And 
---
Most of all
---
Build template is nearly ok to me even if I would prefer a single key to switch template and equip
---
But hey you have the truth and all the others are wrong. So self centered
---
[Houndskin Mantle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Light_Houndskin_Mantle) looks nice and cozy.
---
Valve buys GW2, fixes the engine and makes it VR enabled... Wouldn't be bad.
---
Plus this game is already full of hats.
---
This is why the merged dailies so ppl are on the same map
---
do you really think gw2 could run on a phone with more than 1 powerpoint presentation per minute?
---
Right.
---
Normal pug do not work that way. They do a straight clear 
---
Well till they wipe and cannot move forward
---
If u do not need to pug you are not the avarage player 
---
That's is
---
His work on raids was universally praised.
---
At my age? I'm lucky I remember my wife? 
---
Completing the dungeon wasn't particularly rewarding for me. It took a long time, it was nice I could do it, but I'd seen the dungeon before, many times. The new story I hadn't seen. I liked the feel of the story and the cut scenes. Generally speaking I remember story instances and even zones more than dungeon and fractal completions, unless something goes wrong.
---
But it's not a matter of rewarding. It's what I'm focused on generally. As a writer I focus on story in pretty much every game I play.
---
Time spent vs reward seems to be the metric here. In that case, yeah, sirens reef (and deepstone) feel like shit. The Twilight Oasis updates make that one feel much better for time spent vs reward and that instance is pretty engaging imo
---
I agree talking to other people means you're not an average player.
---
There are literally more raids doing only a few bosses or 1 wing than groups that do full clear. Only exception is reset mondays where clears are more common.
---
Please stop posting this over and over again, with a newly created account at that. It will not be more true if you repeat it more often.
---
https://twitter.com/RomOnCoke
---
I don't want to be less efficient and more of just an extra body. I don't want to be carried. I want min-max my main character and be able to do top dps on every boss.
---
There are tons of raiders, most of them are in guilds, statics or they pug near reset or they pug on the training discords. Go open up your own group and see how fast it fills.
---
Man, this community has been at least 50% negative at almost all times since HoT. *Some* people will hype releases to the heavens, but definitely not all.
---
&gt; now this content is just unplayable!
---
Strange, I play it.
---
It's Rom, [https://www.twitch.tv/roms\_hut/](https://www.twitch.tv/roms_hut/videos)
---
He hasn't been streaming in half a year though
---
I can only wish that you're right, because I'm past putting hope into this game.
---
so..
---
you can't raids^ with your main and so you want to nerf them ?  
---
Oh and btw if there is no raiders anymore that's not because of the difficulty, it's because raids are not released often enough and raiders have guilds to clear at reset.
---
I can't play on mondays
---
I can't see how buying the xpacks would be a waste of money for a new player.  I got back into GW2 a year ago after buying it at launch and basically not playing it, and there was enough content for a solid 9 months of serious playing.  That was well worth $50.
---
I don't see what is a scam about that lol
---
You still mad?
---
Luckily Monday is not the only day of the week!
---
You don't need to succeed for the collection piece though?
---
If you go to the Helicopters in Grothmar, they can take you to o Bjora. Isn't that essentially the same as a connecting portal ?
---
No, but that is on sale as well.
---
I think the usual implication (the reason we come from central Tyria/ heart of maguuma/ Crystal desert) is that the story isn't one single chunk of time. We have other business to attend to while we figure things out. That's why rytlock calls us to the black citadel. We're not going from grothmar to bjora, we're going from wherever the heck our wacky commandering adventures have taken us in between.
---
Also the penalty for death in pvp is loosing the point you are contesting, then while you wait for a respawn your team are out numbered, therefor more likely to die, therefor more likely to loose the conquest point therefor more likely to die??therefor loose the game? That’s a massive penalty? Ths whole reason you’re playing is to win
---
I don't know why this announcement would mean anything to a new player.  There's an enormous amount of quality content that is well worth playing through.  Someone who is new is not going to give a crap about the lack of new content for the game for at least a year
---
Hrm, nah, wouldn't really say. I mean sure you always had negative voices, but the **tone** was very different.
---
Even when HoT was received... let's say... mixed, the negative comments tended to be of the "X sucks, why not make it Y instead?". Now it's "X sucks" or "X sucks, no wonder, no one is working on it, fuck off".
---
Let's have all three
---
Im not complaning about bosses difficulty. They're easy. Im complaining about that there's not enough raiders in this game anymore so it's impossible to raid here.
---
'i don't like how the game is so the game is bad for everyone'
---
see we can both do this, what is the point?
---
I remember getting 30 Mystic coins form them.
---
Do they ? I think it is still the best content when it comes to reward structure and diversity .
---
Especially the cms are big daily fun
---
It will not.
---
And? You can always play other games during the slower times.
---
When are you raiding? Off-hours will always be empty no matter what you are doing. You can also join a guild or any of the training guilds that have multiple runs every day ranging from training, killing X boss to full clears.
---
It will. Look at strike missions. There's plenty of people. Lfg fills up in a few seconds while in raids it requires hours of waiting and after all you won't find anyone.
---
Or someone who just likes the core experience. I'm and alt-o-holic and I'm still enjoying the loop.
---
Afaik there is no brand over the desolation or any Junundu spot. 
---
And since Kralk corrupt by branding -&gt; mostly by flying over them and creating the brand, Junundu seems just to be lucky. As another example there weren't any branded centaurs too, until Kralk met them in the mists, because centaurs don't live near any brand spot. 
---
For Destroyers, since Primordus don't seem to corrupt living beings, but stone and lava, wurms just aren't his "corruption target". Like any other living being too.
---
For Icebroods wurms maybe are just not "worth it". For example Mordrem too didn't corrupt tigers, smokescales, pocket raptors or birds. Maybe for Jormag wurms are on the same level. 
---
Maybe because they are bad in fights or who knows.
---
Calling bullshit on that clear time but yeah that seems to be the OP's claim. That's generally true for MMOs as well: the more you can repeat content, the more valuable it is. The more rewarding content is, the more likely you are to repeat it.
---
From a Dev pov that means you designed something which is built to last and from a player perspective that means the reward is still desirable after umpteenth runs. Because Fractals are rewarding through a daily system which rotates 3/20 different almost every day, you get a good amount of variety with effectively the same rewards with a very comparable overall clear time each day. Aside from rotation 12 which has sr+ds :|
---
solid ocean might not feel all that engaging, but it is still very rewarding for the time spent when it's one of the dailies. Versus, say, aquatic ruins feeling kind of shitty now compared to what it was like before because people both don't have their underwater gear sorted still or know how to play for ideal rotations underwater + the general padding added to drag out the instance.
---
In my grind to fractals god I made a shit ton of gold. Even for how expensive fractal god is to unlock, I made a lot more gold than I spent. I stopped running it daily after achieving that goal... But that has more to do with build templates than the reward value.
---
Fractals come with a progression scale (ar + level unlocks), raw gold payout, valuable and sellable item payout, account bound currencies (journals could stand to have value improvements imo), and daily calls to action. They're pretty much always worth running for the dailies (though recs are ehh).
---
I can only assume that some people are seeing maintenance mode looming, and interpret it as something akin to the Auto Assault shutdown where the GAME was abandoned and rapidly taken offline.
---
Meantime I put lfg for strike mission and it fills up without any problems. You really can't see that there's not enough raiding people anymore in Guild Wars 2? Do we play the same game?

---
Wow. Is that Anet's goal? To make us play other games rather hook us on their  own? Like pretty much every other game tries to do?
---
death spasms
---
Open lfg . I do need to prove nothing just open lfg
---
For those who believe the game is dying: Just wait and see. I do believe we are going to get great things in this saga.
---
Personally I feel that community has a merit to the state the game is. And ofc anet handpicked the praises of one part of community neglecting the criticism from the other part. The last straw for me was when anet pointed fingers on the critisist part of community telling them that they are abusive.
---
Oh but I am wrong and raiding community is so wide... Plz
---
Oh absolutely. I really don't want to load up my spreadsheet and actually *see* how much I've put into this game over the years... 
---
I recall buying the The Secret World Grandmaster (lifetime) subscription.... right before the game dropped to F2P and then straight into maintenance.....and then straight into a "remaster" and instant abandonment. I was gutted, and that was only 200 bucks. I can't imagine how hard this'll  hit some people in the future.
---
But it’s like you said before if you focus too much on one type of content you disenfranchise other poeple. A net focus too much on the casual side and the story, that might be alright for you. I personally think that in an MMO having a good rewards and reward content is incredibly vital for a healthy MMO and prioritising this and encouraging and making your player base actually have to think about their builds and how best to invest in their characters is absolutely fundamental, even in open world and story instances. It is a determinant to the game that they purposely make the high light and selling point of their game the living world/saga easy by design and tell you it’s expansion level content when there is no new raids no new dungeons and no new fractals(strike missions have potential but the rewards from completing still aren’t there)it Just isn’t enough for a lot of people. If I wanted just story I’d go read a book or watch a film. The reason why I play an MMO is so I can invest in something fun. The fact that the majority of the content they release is easy there for isn’t fun and the rewards not that impressive for me it fails as an MMO
---
An asura riding a bear lore-wise instead of a golem is just silly but that's just my view. The point is to make the races feel more special, we already have enough options to make everybody look silly like glitter splashed raptors or what have you.
---
If you drastically change the game from what it was, you also disenfranchise people. That's what HoT did and the game lost a lot of players over that. Casual players. Some came back...some didn't.
---
If you are transformed to the boneskinner, **all minis** are giant. I though everyone knew it?
---
Sorry I are right. Many lfg sell to those without dpk
---
and then kralkatorrik branded them.
---
The only problem I see is Anet tends to hire new generation of devs who dont want to go out of their comfort zone and challenge themselves and others by producing challenging, grinding, repetitive content. The whole game is set in an awesome environment but players get to use about 5% of it, rest is discarded as used condoms.
---
The same for me. Managed to get to 32k AP without touching pvp or wvw for the past 5 years lol.
---
Disagree that it's silly. It's a bear. Enough Asura rangers have that as a pet. Asura would still be able to ride a golem, they'd also just have the option of riding a bear. Just like humans would be able to ride a golem. Races don't need to be special, they're already visually different. Restricting cool cosmetic options (when that's what the endgame rewards are) to a single race only is arbitrary.
---
Let's do that again without the loaded question, okay?
---
Ah, right.
---
Huh. Damn. We might be on to something.
---
You are an abomination of a player for playing in a guild.
---
This is the essence of our disagreement. I believe that vast majority, not a small group but the vast majority of people who play MMOs are casuals. The evidence is as I've said many times, and this is from the devs, a good player does 500% more damage than an average player. Not a bad player...and average player. I think you'll find the vast majority of players in this game really don't know how to play it at all.  Probably true of most MMOs.
---
Lets hope riot buys anet and give us a gw3 :)
---
NOT JASON 😭
---
&gt; Calling bullshit on that clear time 
---
Well, it is normal for high kp cm+t4 group, t4-only groups are probably such a clusterfuck, that it takes longer for them due to wipes. But it can also take less, if you tryhard it with a static. I don't think fractal should be aimed for the kind of people t4-only groups have, because if t4 SR is too hard and isn't worth it for them, they can always go and do lower tiers. With so much talk about easy mode raids, somehow everyone feels themselves entitled to nothing less that hardest mode fractals. 
---
&gt;The more rewarding content is, the more likely you are to repeat it.
---
But it isn't just that, if by "rewarding" you mean only gold and currencies. Would you be doing boring non-engaging tasks  just for some imaginary money? And if you would, why won't you go, do some RL job and buy gems instead? 
---
 Gameplay is a rewards on itself in fractals and SR surely provides better base  for it than jade maw. I would come back into SR (and fractals in general), because  it provides me with opportunities to react to various situations, to try new things and to perfect old ones with the obvious impact on how my run goes. And jade maw (and current openworld content) has very little of that.
---
How does arbitrary exclusivity add 'depth', and how is that 'depth' taken away if other people can use mount skins how they prefer though? Does it impact your roleplay experience if somebody wants to ride a fern hound as a human? You're not forced to do it yourself.
---
I like these concepts! Would like to have such mounts. I think some people don't know the difference between raw concepts (THE IDEA) and concept *arts done by professional artists*.
---
thats a good video KEKW
---
I agree we simply have to agree to disagree and there’s nout wrong with that. I’m enjoying your take on gw2. the difference is other MMOs the good Players that do 500% more damage rise to the top and have the better gear the better rewards that is seen as a good thing. That is seen as desirable and something to work towards and envy and want to aspire to be . In gw2 that is not the case and is almost frowned apon and seen as a bad thing by the community. That’s the impression I get anyway
---
tx go they are not. just imagine not being able to do that instead of having groups doing every hour. ù
---
a wing is just arenas with corridor in connection each other
---
The formula "new map, new story, new mastery" wasn't that boring when they used to put some new current events in between releases. Which is kinda close to LS1. The bandits attacks and them dropping white mantle insignas, the rifts and Auris Weirdbringer, the Ley Anomalies and the Shadowstone/Krait oil, even Seis Burntheart and her moving every few days to follow Primordius' signal and hinting towards Draconis Mons, these were great to experience, and filling a bit the void we had from the lack of repeatable content inbetween episodes. I wish more current events were implemented to supply those times.
---
I believe that it's a few days of fractals t4 to buy a single episode
---
Just as a heads up, there is a Copter in Grothmar that takes you to Bjora, effectively serving as a portal. As some have mentioned, the story flow was a consideration for those who don't own prologue.
---
Hope this helps :)
---
I don't know, I just ignored the fractals for some months and now, when I went back for some clovers, I found the bad news. Some t4 groups, t3 is empty. I ended up doing my dailies on t2 even if I can easily handle t4. I tried hosting a group, no class restriction etc, but still nobody joined.

Are there any good spots like draconis mons jp to park alts for accessories? DM and bitterfrost cover all but 1 accessory.
---
OMG ITS SC
---
Oh that's awesome, didn't know that. Thanks! :)
---
I believe that something many people don't realize is, even if you're not interested at all in some game modes (typically higher tier instances like fractals and raids, and competitive pvp), those modes are played by a part of the playerbase (the most dedicated) that is *vital* for the health of any community because they are those who write the guides and teach the best stuff to everyone else.
---
So abandoning those game modes affects everyone, even those who don't play them.
---
Some parts of this community have absolutely been abusive. That's not even a question. Not so much here, but Twitter is a cesspool and God knows what PMs devs have received.
---
Those patches are usually small just to mostly nerf something that's really outclassing everything.  Full balance patches are fewer and father between.
---
I want bik to return so he makes another quitting video.
---
Imagine how the family pet feels eating the same dry kibble for years, but players have a choice to leave unlike the dog.
---
You know what, you're right about the undertones to the negativity. It's changed.
---
Whether or not you trust anything they say is up to you. You don't know anything about my interactions with Grouch, so calling me naive for believing him is just rude and ignorant. Anyway, my main point is that you're tying too much legitmacy to your own assumptions because you aren't willing to even consider the alternative. I guess that makes you 100% right on at least one thing, though. There's no point in having this discussion.
---
Back to bunker wars we go!
---
It hurts to think about, though, doesn't it?  What I used to be able to sink in several hours at a time in, reduced to less than a week every few months.  The close-knit guild that recruited me all the way back in Cursed Shore farming days, now more-or-less completely drifted apart.  Sure, a few of us log in every content release, but even then it's only like 4-5 of us for maybe a couple weeks at best.
---
Call me too emotional if you want, but that emptiness hurts.
---
Every new episode we will be starting from black citadel cuz devs are too scared people who ddnt play the last patch cant go to the new map.
---
You may want a regular Fern Hound, but you also *already know what a fern hound looks like*, so there would be *no point at all for me to do a concept for it.* So, instead of *wasting my time depicting something that has already been depicted in-game*, I'm going to present a *new idea*, as *that's the whole point of concept art*.
---
Probably only the 2 on one side and stuff is sliding off, they just forgot to tell us what hit the floor.
---
I would say it's a bit of each, the svanir area in Bitterfrost is both overtuned and really weird AIwise, it's one of the most dangerous areas in Tyria imo. But they also probably had a little bit of "make enemies easier"-itis that tends to creep into any mmo in newer content.
---
That said I think the balance is fairly okay in Bjora, some of the champs can definitely downstate you. And that is a death in gw2, I suppose. :)
---
I was incorrect in my WoW example, apparently other races can get other races mounts, but they have to earn rep for that race to buy them, instead of having them from the get-go if you were from that race to start.
---
Ask anet to give less outfits and more armors

fractal pugs dont get far without HB, and no pugs ever want to play HB. I'm not ashamed to admit i "main" HB but it's for the same reason i mained monk in gw1 - necessity.
---
that being said i can play every role more than competently and solid idea fucking sucks (but any rework they do would only make it worse so)
---
Yep, wow does mounts really well. They don't lock them arbitrarily by something like race. Unfortunately they still have racials with pretty big power differences and lock races by faction.
---
That's one of the many things I loved the most when they released Jahai Bluff. It was the first time in the history of living stories that not only two LS maps connected to each other, but *also* served as a link to a core expansion map. It made Elona feel way more cohesive. You can literally walk from Crystal Oasis to Kourna without once opening the map.
---
I wish the same happens with future saga releases. Right now Grothmar and Bjora feels... disconnected, but hopefully future far Shiverpeaks maps connect better.
---
Plus the feedback of the invested players will motivate the studio to insert certain needed changes. I don't want to be offensive towards anybody but the typical GW2 player who logs in to spam 1 and complete a World boss won't offer a structured, cirtical feedback that can be used for further developments.
---
Do you know how you end up with "all cards are on the table"?  When everyone just picks up and leaves, and nobody remains to gather them and return to the package.
---
Most mmos are fairly anti competitive. Most of the remaining mmorpg playerbase wants this, too. Hate towards genuine skill based competition is pretty wide spread.
---
I suggest moba's instead. Smite is closer to mmorpgs because of its third person nature. I havent played it in about 5 years but it was fairly enjoyable at the time. Lol and dota are both still options as well.
---
Agree to disagree. 2021 to me is still very far away. I was being extremely generous by even mentioning the second half of 2020.
---
AHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHA
---
Eternal Magic pvp is literally a copy of gw2, I played the beta some time ago and it was fun, but sadly I dont think many people will be interested in this game
---
The same reasons why people nowadays fail with meta builds and all other resources that exist about bosses.
---
which class tho? looks like maybe guardian. could be warclaw-mounted in wvw too
---
I do have to say that afks are pretty rare. I remember a few years back they were extremely common in my games.
---
I don’t see it as cheating. I see it as studying the game, feeding my need to want to be good at the game not only that but become better than other players and make good money in said game.just the same way you’d get a good job in life or study for an exam to be better and get a good grade.
---
Sounds like you want mostly the RPG I want the MMO RPG a good mix of two, gw2 focuses on the RPG too much in my opinion and let’s the MMO part suffer which is argue is probably more important than the story but ah well, you enjoy it and I’ll find something else. Like I said I just think gw2 could be such a a good mmo RPG if done right, especially with the graphics and the art style paired with how good the combat system is.
---
I feel ya. I play other necros and I completely bomb lmao
---
Omg why didnt I think of that? Such an easy solution haha xD
---
so like jormag then
---
They really need to make AR progression not linked to gear but progression of the lower level fractals.  Many newer players that just arrived at the point where you are supposed to get into end game do not get into fractals because the lower levels are dead.  Even if they weren't completing them does not progress your ability to do higher tiers.  They are hit with a hard gold gate to get ascended gear to participate with all the players running t4s on a regular basis and quit the game instead.
---
I care about any project that I fell part of, when you are a monkey that has to del X of the 200X of the same code refactoring / testing / migration per week it doesn't matter if you are working for NASA, Facebook, amazon, googgle, municipla motorization...
---
[here's mine](https://imgur.com/pXZHeBj), I think the earmuffs and raven mantle go well together to make you look warm
---
That's implying they like all of the content. He has no interest in gw2's structured pve or wvw. He wanted to try the LWS more than anything, that he has to all buy. 
---
It's not a very enticing offer when you have to buy episodes on top of the game for content you MIGHT like and it's basically 100% the game is already dying and lost a lot of people + if any content is released it's trash.
---
Sry but even I wouldn't wanna play in that environment and I like this game... There's others I'd rather he directs his money towards, not a lost cause.
---
Pugs are a mixed bag, in non-cm groups it's hard to know what you're gonna get. I can play QB and HB decently, but with pugs of unknown skill I start as HB and adjust from there. Hell, some t4 pugs still can't CC or like...dodge.
---
I agree if the game seems empty of players it's more of an empty experience, but the game doesn't seem empty to me.  Maybe it's trending that way but I think you still have plenty of time before it becomes a ghost town
---
This us vs them mentality is amazing.
---
They used it to marginalize every group of players that isnt super casual and into living story for years. While reeeing about elitism for bonus points.
---
We're a appearantly a strict minority and have been forever, yet still get blamed for anything that goes wrong. Bonus points if they suck anets dick and also blame ncsoft at the same time.
---
Just enjoy the reality TV level entertainment the us vs them mentality provides. Embrace it. 
---
You can be moderate and nuanced, but that's doomed to be irrelevant more often  than not.
---
If it cant be expressed as a simple one liners that make you feel gud (FLUFF) then the casuals wont like it. And the veterans are here out of spite, if it doesnt represent their grief they wont like it either.
---
Friendly reminder that gw2 by making only content ANYONE can complete, we achieve natural selection towards gamers that want trivial gameplay. It's a wonderful social experiment tbh.
---
I can understand that - the LW story is such a mess as it is.  You follow along thru leveling, and then randomly skip to season 2 where you have no idea what is going on, who any of the characters are, and why you should care.  And the stories in the xpacs are pretty good imo but there's a cohesiveness that is missing that is sad.
---
Still I don't know why the game being in a 'dying' state would prevent you from enjoying what it is - it's not like we're in ghost town territory here
---
And vice versa.
---
This.  AR Progression isn't healthy for the game mode.  It's a poorly explained mechanic that requires gear progression which is something that GW2 really isn't super compatible with.  I've always felt that ArenaNet should cycle the BL skins within Fractal Encryptions from Aetherized to something else every major patch or every other major patch.  As it stands the loot tables inside FoTM other than 99/100cm are pretty unexciting.  
---
Ever since ArenaNet introduced agony impedance and the fractal titles they've had the tech for account-bound AR.  I think the big catch-all is that they don't want to re-work agony and gear infusions again (versatile vs. offensive/defensive infusions).  With Fractal Ben (Benjamin Arnold) gone this seems like something that isn't ever going to happen.  If it were up to me I'd link some account bound AR to the Fractal Initiate, Adept, Expert and Master achievements.  The challenge is preserving AR for people that optimize AR to give them extra stats like precision or concentration as well as ensuring that account-augmentations mean something.
---
Makes sense.
---
my point was, that a hardcore scene and casual scene can coexist. thank u for the information, but i feel like you should have replied to the dude above xD
---
I mean heck, fractals were designed to be a 5 man dungeon.  As in singular, FotM was our first new dungeon and simply designed to be a bit new an innovative where a single run of said dungeon would be different every time.  As of such the length was made to match a dungeon run.  When Fractals released they were supposed to be a glimpse how future dungeons might be designed with how they would scale using various methods.  Of course eventually dungeons were shelved entirely and Fractals became *the* endgame dungeon and not *an* endgame dungeon, but yeah it makes sense they are designed the way they are.
---
That said with them making fractals the "all or nothing" endgame dungeon, they really should rework a few to make them follow a bit more in line with what they are now and not what they were supposed to be in the past.  That said, instanced content doesn't appear to be much a pryority at Anet.
---
The game may be dead but the memes live on!
---
Longevity? LS1? For about 4 weeks, yeah...
---
Less quickly than grinding out events though, imo.
---
It was a good run.

Oh I found it y' know, I just love to see people like you still denying that this game really goes downhill

When getting 5x25 might was a team effort and now druid does double that by accident.

Rude and ignorant sums up your posting for the recent history. If you're expecting me to believe second hand claims on face value with no actual data or indication as to how accurate the sourcing is, then I will continue to laugh at your "alternative".
---
... you realize the subreddit isn't a mirror of the game, right? Anet could very much still recover from this unpleasant state of decaying repute, if they actually release a bunch of good stuff for all the famished departments and then... just kinda keep going. 
---
The thing is just, to get there, they need to... actually do that.

---
It's impossible to be both a long time player, well informed about the happenings of the developer company and have a positive outlook for the future of this game.  This is the case for many people on Reddit, a place to stay current about the game and Anet.
---
Yes it does feel like we get a gut punch every two weeks or so, either by anet under delivering or continued signs anet is not doing well.
---
Is the game fun in all its rights?  Of course it is.  But many of us are on this road and the further we are down it the tougher it looks,. Those of us that have been playing since day one are expecting a road closed sign any time now.  We love the game, but feel it's potential and life has been cut short by blatent mismanagement by Mike O'Brian diverting developer resources off Guild Wars 2, the company's bread and butter to the point he got half his company laid off.

I know how you feel : (

So..this is how the end looks like? Well...at least I feel peace..

---
&gt;Truth hurts. While OP's post might be unnecessary at this point, there's no single Word in his post that is not true. Reddit may seem to be a bad place bcoz in most of the cases only the more invested players come here, registrate and post. The peeps that love autoattacking story bosses every 3 month (sorry, no offense!) won't come here and argue or debate anybody. You can't find any online community that posts good things in majority. The good things are there, it's good, but the bad things must be fixed and although it is not necessary to create a post every day, that is still true.
---
Nobody says the game is dead in a way that is unplayable or close to shutdown. If someone here says dead it means dead in terms of stability, continuity, cadence and endgame content.
---
I would say that golems can't be corrupted is because they're not living. As all corrupted creatures were at one point alive or are alive. And Primordus creates elementals and hasn't been shown to actually corrupt creatures into Destroyers.
---
4g. VPN to use is blocked which is dumb. So used 4g data and it uses a lot of data for just playing for 5 minutes
---
All game communities become more toxic as time progresses. It's a crust of dissatisfied players that can't move on and that builds up and up until their toxicity drives away everyone enjoying themselves and starts a negative feedback loop.
---
The biggest issue is that all legitimate concern gets drowned out. It's not the religious sticking to the same formula that's a problem, it's "2 hours of content every 3 months" which is factual bullshit, because everything is made up and nothing matters. It's not about abusive people sending vile messages to developers, it's suppressing legitimate concerns! (like the 2 hours, 3 months meme), because nothing matters and everything is made up anyway. It's not enough that the build templates are EA-levels of monetized and killed ArcDPS KILLING the playing field of highly involved players without offering a solution, no build templates are literally the worst thing for everyone, even those who never used ArcDPS in the first place and factually GAINED a fuckton of functionality, because everything is made up and nothing matters anyway.
---
Not to mention that this sub has been condoning wife-beater "fandom" since ... forever. *Of course* that drags everything down.
---
I mained MM necro in GW1. Whenever my friend on ele died I used their corpse for another minion and thanked them for giving me their dps
---
good old days
---
From what ? Server shutdown ? Gw1 is still up. At least they will reduce wvw servers merging . We have years yet so np from meif this is your downhill . Even more or they keep on adding content like last map
---
And now the train is burning, devs are jumping out the windows and upfront is that crazy dude from [Snowpiercer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowpiercer) sitting on nice gourmet food and wine and having the engine run by brainwashedfan boys. Meanwhile in the very last wagon the longterm players are living in extreme poverty and are starving (for worthwhile content.) 
---
In the middle are the casuals, not living really either, but buying the crap causing gourmet guy upfront to enjoy life.
---
you forgot lordkrall

**Snowpiercer**
---
Snowpiercer (Korean: 설국열차; Hanja: 雪國列車; RR: Seolgungnyeolcha) is a 2013 science fiction action film based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand and Jean-Marc Rochette. The film is directed by Bong Joon-ho, and written by Bong and Kelly Masterson. A South Korean-Czech co-production, the film marks Bong's English-language debut; approximately 80% of the film was shot in English.The film stars Chris Evans, Song Kang-ho, Tilda Swinton, Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, Go Ah-sung, John Hurt, and Ed Harris. The movie takes place aboard the Snowpiercer train, operating on a globe-spanning track, carrying the last remnants of humanity after an attempt at climate engineering in order to stop global warming has unintentionally created a new Snowball Earth.

There's so much content in the game, and i guess it's not top of people's lists to do. Honestly, i think the game has too much content. I can finish the Wheel of Time series (4.4 million words) in 6 months but all the GW2 content will take me years.
---
What's the point . It is new content .
---
Quit
---
It's like that huge space between The Desolation and Vabbi.
---
One can clearly see the gates under Awakened control that connects the path between the Desolation and Vabbi, and there's even roads marked in the uncovered map, but we skip all the way through a different passage. 
---
It would have been cool if there was intermediate instanced maps connecting two maps that are too far from each other, with random enemy encounters inside. Kind of like the maps for ambushes in Baldur's Gate games.
---
Be first with your fields ;) I also would like to know which field i would blast, instead of 3 random condi cleanses on mursaat.
---
&gt; Many newer players that just arrived at the point where you are supposed to get into end game do not get into fractals because the lower levels are dead.
---
What? I had zero issues running fractals in any tier when I started from zero. There's loads of people runnning tier 1.
---
The rules said, no pictures without context, but i think many people relate.
---
"Dodging is a DPS loss."
---
30s later - dead to Skorvald's Whirling Defense because split off stability-stack.
---
&gt; All good things come to an end, and online games do suck a lot of your time. I’ll keep an eye out for whatever new they release but its time to move forward now, same as they have done.
---
If GW2 ends, and they announce GW3 I am done with the franchise. In part because just disappointed at how poorly the last year has been managed, but like you say online games take a LOT of your time, and I have family and career to think about now that I didn't 12 years ago with GW1 (well, had family back then, less career). 
---
I'd rather stick with well polished, single player focused games with good story moving forward, or drop in and play games like Rocket League.
---
Lol all of us who played gw1 pvp disagree with you...
---
We want actual gvg for the mAT and as the premier pvp game mode again
---
AND we want real competitive pvp like gw1 had... not randomway cloaked as “ranked” pip farm
---
Thunder field is also great if you time it early.
---
I know I'm gravedigging here, but I've played healing spec'd thief in WvW for a long time. P/D SB in Apothecary since southsun cove and the apothecary set was released. I've been on a hiatus, but I just came back, and I'm updating my build. I picked  up Daredevil when HoT came out, but never really stuck around. But most recently, they've released the Plague Doctor set, and it looks perfect. Here's a build:
---
[http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PawAoiVlFwEZHMH2IO2OrteA-zVJYvRHfhkSF0dIESC4+nIQ7hHA-w](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PawAoiVlFwEZHMH2IO2OrteA-zVJYvRHfhkSF0dIESC4+nIQ7hHA-w)
---
Now, I never intended this to be a heal other people build. So rather than shadow savior, I have leeching venoms, because my intention was to heal myself. I would recommend instead of merciful ambush, that you use hidden thief, and run shadow step and shadow refuge, taking advantage of the deception cooldowns. You have enough shadow steps that you can burst heal just fine, and I've never had trouble ressing people with shadow refuge.
---
Actually there is also a helicopter to Bjora in Grothmar (not a path, but apparently Bangar blew up the only one, so I suppose taking a helicopter is easier than rebuilding a bridge in a blizzard). In the area in the keep where the commander and Rytlock get jumped by charr hoping to take out Rytlock (from the prologue story) there are two helicopter pads. One currently goes to Bjora, not sure where the other one will take us (possibly the other side of Bjora once the map gets expanded next episode?)
---
It never gets better lol 😅😢
---
I wish they would give a modified boneskinner look to the flesh golem.
---
&gt; This adds nothing at all to the conversation
---
There was a conversation?
---
PSA: There is a way to get to Bjora directly from the Grothmar map. If you go to the area to the left of the Great Hall POI in Grothmar, there are 2 choppers waiting, one of which will take you to Bjora (you also have the option to go back to Grothmar from the Bjora chopper)
---
gw2's current meta is to criticize or whiteknight the game and see who is louder. There are valid points for both fronts but most people fail to recognize the adversary's rightful claims.
---
So basically real life and it's wayyyy more entertaining than the current shitfest the game's future plans are.
---
Going by this, the next big mission in the pattern will probably just be a swearing match.
---
Well, we've seen the Elder Dragons corrupt the land and rocks themselves (like what Kralkatorrik's corruption does in Fields of Ruin by creating Branded elementals out of rock) but we also see in *Edge of Destiny* that Kralkatorrik's magic couldn't penetrate Big Snaff which shielded Snaff within it until Kralkatorrik sent the Branded to tear the golem apart to get to Snaff, so using such bigger golems as "power armors" for us mere mortals could be quite useful in combating the dragons' corruption. So whatever the asura are using for their golems makes it different from the typical minerals etc. the Elder Dragons corrupt in the landscape. It would be nice if the devs explored this more to show us what the dragons' limitations are in this matter. :)
---
Incidentally I think the steam creatures might also be impervious to dragon corruption. They're a bit confusing in that they were originally created as artificial beings by Scarlet but began incorporating organic matter into their expanding models by the time of personal story. I imagine their shell casing (given the steam creatures' ingenuity) would be sturdy enough to protect them from corruption; it would also be a good reason for devs to answer the old question from Season 2 about what happened to Batch 2 that Scarlet sent to Brisban Wildlands but which is nowhere to be seen there (as opposed to Batch 1 which has established a foothold in Lornar's Pass).
---
well, i can get around 95% uptime of fire fields with my fb when in fractals :p
---
&gt;  The original Guild Wars is still one of the most unique MMOs of all time and it's timeless
---
The original Guild Wars wasn't an MMO.  It was Diablo-style, except that instead of chat rooms between games to form parties the chat rooms were represented in-game by cities where you could see other players and talk to them.
---
Beyond that, what you ask for is entirely unrealistic.  Guild Wars exists in two dimensions, there is no vertical axis so adding jumping (and the associated falling) would require a complete rework of the game code, while your 'refurbished maps' would likewise require a ton of new art.  This is way too much effort to put into a 15 year old game that they're still selling at full price 99% of the time.
---
Honestly no, not really.   
---
I have no real feeling of want to go back.
---
But then, it wouldn't be a "Guild Wars Classic". There would be so much to change, it would almost be a whole new game.
---
Here's what Im here for:
---
Waiting for Alliances.
---
Waiting for New World.
---
Waiting for Ashes of Creation.
---
Its sad to see senior staff go, but hey, thats the natural way of things.
---
Also, I mean.. Bjora map is only half released... common guys. At least wait for the other half to get all dhuumy about it. Enjoy the strikemission. Its fun.
---
retention is pretty key for most if not all MMOs, you know.
---
The 1% lol, are you blind?
---
Or just give us the [GW1 Flesh Golem](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Flesh_Golem) look back at the current art quality level. It's not exactly the same but better than the potato we currently have.
---
Mountains are to Rocky to burrow in. But maybe the snow would work?
---
Sure but most of new players who want PvP plays moba and most of old player are grown older and have no more as much time as 7 years ago
---
I'd much rather have Guild Wars 2 with the Guild Wars 1 system to be honest, instead of the other way around.
---
Lol no. Like wowclassic you are just looking with pink Googles of good old times
---
It comes down to ppl,like aways,i just did cm fractals with SC and they though that  3 sec phases are slow...
---
Are you sure?
---
Even rats are sensible enough to try and jump off a sinking boat.
---
&gt; Basically a Guild Wars on the current GW2 platform
---
But it wouldn't be a "Guild Wars Classic" nor "Original Guild Wars" then.
---
&gt;but could be a good method to recycle what ANet already has, **saving up resources** and delivering a new revenue stream.
---
Ehm...
---
&gt; a Guild Wars that's updated with the current mechanics (jumping, swimming, dodging etc.), character voicing, better graphics and so on but with the classic story, refurbished maps and so on
---
You talking about programming a whole new game. It would be as big as the current GW2 including all expansions and LS episodes if not bigger. How should this "saving up resources"?
---
meh as long that you didn't blame your mates in everysingle games and aknowledged your mistakes trying to get better, you're pretty far from garbage mate.
---
Turned me from a skeptic to a believer. That was amazing. Thanks for sharing.
---
Is there a viable Power DPS / Boon support build for Guardian? I liked the DPS approach using boons (especially retaliation and aegis) while leveling, and also want to help the group with something apart from raw damage. 
---
It's mostly for open world and Fractals, at most Strike Missions, but not Raids. I have access to elite specs (though I still need the HP). Note I said "viable", it doesn't need to be "meta", as long as it's fun to play.
---
Bring back slippery slope (twice as slippery) as a challenge mode for every fractal for the memes
---
I do quite like Fractals. They aren't perfect by any stretch, but I find they actually give a pretty satisfying sense of progression that you don't really get anywhere else in the game.  Running dailies doesn't take that long, and they're pretty rewarding. You have good short term rewards (gold, encryptions, t5 &amp; 6 mats), good mid-term rewards (ascended rings, stat infusions, account rewards, fractal weapon skins), and a good long term reward (legendary backpack &amp; Fractal God title).  Seeing your fractal level rise, as well as your AR, and unlocking the various potions, gives a consistent and tangible sense of progress.  It went through some serious growing pains to get here, but I think it's a pretty good system now.  If only we could get more fractals to get to at least 25 so there's no repeats in a tier.
---
I loved Dragonfall (other than the Skygate grind). The credits rolling made it seem like an END though.
---
Quickbrand is fun :3 Healbrand is funner !!
---
Never played GW1, he looks like a true elite minion !
---
I hate it too. But you know what I hate most? The fact that we’re SO close and they couldn’t even bridge the map art. Like seriously anet PLEASE just draw a little more mountain to connect the maps
---
You can't move map to map on foot to Sandswept Isles or Dragonfall either.
---
&gt; At least wait for...
---
and as soon as the ~~next episode~~ second half of the episode releases and a majority of the (decently informed) expectations and predictions come true someone is gonna parrot that statement again in a slightly different flavour. this pattern has been repeated for seven years. it lost its validity years ago, and frankly i'm somewhat glad that a broader spectrum of the playerbase is finally catching up to that fact - not because i want anet to land on its face, but because it means the delusional and irrational naiveté that reigned here for years can't drown out any and all (valid and reasonable) criticism anymore.
---
Scared? 😂
---
While it's never been confirmed, I could see two ways for why Sohothin needed Balthazar to ignite it:
---
1) Sohothin, having once been Balthazar's own sword as confirmed by Connie Griffith, returned to him after Rytlock lost the sword in the Foefire cleansing attempt. Balthazar, recognizing the sword, took its fire into himself maybe in an attempt to free himself before Rytlock barged in. Realizing he could trade with this charr, he offered to light the sword with the fire he had already taken and maybe keeping a tiny bit of it for himself once Rytlock had freed him. It would explain why he was able to open a mist portal despite being depowered, and why he could form a lesser version of his armor to protect him as shown in the cinematic.
---
2) Sohothin's flame was simply extinguished because the failed Foefire cleansing ritual depleted it. Balthazar still had a spark of divine energy within him (despite no longer being a god; whether it suggests he was originally a demigod before ascending to godhood is unknown) and used it to ignite the sword to manipulate Rytlock.
---
We get some additional insight about Balthazar and Rytlock's meeting in the [Requiem short story](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Requiem:_Rytlock):
---
&gt; “Is that your sword?”  
---
&gt; The stranger’s voice carried far in the Mists. It was deep, powerful—maybe in life he’d been some great lord, crossed someone he shouldn’t have, wound up chained in these wastelands. Didn’t matter to me.  
---
&gt; My eyes were on the blade buried deep in the stone, its flame long extinguished. My goal, finally in sight after—how long had it been? Time is strange in the Mists.  
---
&gt; “I only ask,” the stranger said, “because it looks like Sohothin’s lost its spark.”  
---
&gt; I stopped. Or maybe just my heart did.  
---
&gt; “How do you know its name?”  
---
&gt; The stranger smiled. People are strange in the Mists, too.  
---
&gt; “Who doesn’t know of Sohothin?” he asked. “Legendary blade of fire and war, taken up by a charr.”  
---
&gt; Word travels around, I guess. He offered to reignite it.  
---
&gt; I should’ve known. That was the moment I should’ve known. Idiot.  
---
&gt; But it was also the moment I realized I could get Sohothin back. I’d wandered the Mists for what felt like a lifetime, ancient battles repeating for eternity—and now there was a chance to take back the light. My light.  
---
&gt; I didn’t ask who he was or why he was chained up. I just wanted my life back.  
---
&gt; “You can reignite it?”  
---
&gt; The stranger raised his arm, and the flame within Sohothin sparked, piercing through the gloom of the Mists.  
---
&gt; I should’ve noticed how easily his muscles ignored the weight of his chains. I should’ve noticed the hungry flicker of flame in his eyes.  
---
&gt; But how much did I really see? How much do I just wish I’d seen?  
---
&gt; Sparks and cinders filled the air as I wrenched the blade from the stone. Its heat felt familiar. Now I was smiling, too. With Sohothin, everything always seemed just a little easier.  
---
&gt; “That blade is truly a marvel,” the stranger said. “I see how you look at it. You appreciate how special it is.”  
---
&gt; I told him it was good at its job, but I won’t lie. Part of me was vindicated. The stranger had no answer except to raise both his arms and stretch out his chains.  
---
&gt; And then I freed him.  
---
&gt; It was my fault. Everything that came after—all because I wanted that damn sword back.  
---
&gt; I told myself it was to free Ascalon of its curse, but that excuse didn’t last long. I wanted Sohothin because it was mine. Because I earned it. Or at least—I paid for it.  
---
&gt; When the stranger—when Balthazar—saw how I looked at it, could he see what I thought of myself without it?  
---
It would be nice if we ever got an explanation to why Sohothin's flame was extinguished in the Mists. Balthazar certainly has quite a few mysteries surrounding him, some of which may hopefully be answered one day. :)
---
While I understand that feeling, I'm not sure about how effective the AR system is in weeding out players who don't belong into high fractals. I've seen too many people in T4s who didn't have a clue about anything.
---
Yeah, what else is there to talk about with this game.  
---
“The episode was spooky! It was dark and the doors opened by themselves, isnt that spooky guys?”
---
“omg did you see the thing that happened in the story, crazy right?”
---
All right, then what? What further conversation needs to be happening in a game where nothing exciting happens?
---
Good point. Wurms and dragons may be closer relatives than we presently realize.
---
It's like the reverse of Primordus/Jormag.
---
Fire comes from above while the ice rises up from below.
---
Not that old . But if u started with mmo with Ultima u are over 40 now
---
So don't do Fractals with them if you don't like it.
---
Im tired of Going into wvw and spamming fire ring to be the only one that actually blast it Lmao. I run dagger dagger
---
Seconded for Smite. Although the gameplay is a lot slower and strategic than GW2, which I think it’s mostly to smite’s benefit.
---
&gt;None of the posts I made here ever mentioned raids which is why I straight up said you aren't writing anything related to my OP, aka the start of this comment chain.
---
I'm allowed to bring up things that you didn't. You said "So yeah, we all play story at some point in varying degrees, that doesn't mean story is the most important aspect of the game."
---
To which I replied "I've been playing constantly since launch, and haven't entered PvP or WvW in over two years (and not a ton before that). My only raiding experience is a few hours attempting Vale Guardian and Goreseval. "
---
I was making the point that while you seemed to believe that players only did story when they had "nothing better to do," I felt the opposite, and felt that given how very few players engaged in those other modes at all, it likely meant that more players would relate to my experience than yours. 
---
To this, you made a petulant personal attack, and then went on a tangent about how you didn't think I was paying enough attention to a post several back, without detailing how that should be an issue. 
---
At no point did you present a compelling counterargument, which indicates that you do not have one, and just wan to give the appearance of having a point by being dismissive.
---
Hahaha. Good one!
---
gw2 has streamers?
---
okay buddy.
---
Well I'm sorry for you then, that must make it really difficult to enjoy things. There's a decade of content to check out. My wife started playing a year ago and she was absolutely enchanted with even the really old stuff. And I had a blast making new toons to play along with her.
---
If the point of gaming is to enjoy yourself, I think we accomplished that very well.
---
Your negativity is only hurting you and getting in the way of your fun. And I think that applies to a lot of people on this sub. It's a game, not a career. Treat it like one.
---
He made it sounds like as if there was genuine communication between Anet and the playerbase, but some people like OP were drowning it out and derailing.
---
Ultima is still somehow around. My it was my roommates first Mmo and he's 25
---
I would really like that. Path of Exile is a great game with a great community. That might even increase chances to see GW: Beyond Elona
---
wow with all the information we just got im definitely going to reinstall
---
Rerolling until you got a swamp fractal was the worst part for me.

I was got damn unlucky regarding this part.

Some people get very, very offended when they learn you're aware of their DPS.  I've had 30k+ AP players completely lose their shit.
---
People have talked about the dailies/masteries. People are actually disappointed about them.
---
So when Ring of Fire like GW1?
---
And then they became best friends.
---
With everything so bleak, I guess im leaving.
---
Yep, I've been suggesting new players to avoid this place for quite a while now. Most of my GW2 discussion these days is on discords.
---
after playing casually for 20k hours in the game and having x trillion posts on the forums he ended up with the same fate, shitposting on reddit because there is no content. :^)
---
It's hilarious because you have people who supposedly quit negativity years ago, but can't bring themselves to stop stalking this sub's negativity comments and threads, and hating on them every chance they get. Find another sub, go play GW2, or something  
---
  
---
You can't tell the sub is dead or bad, i'm enjoying it and I don't see why do you have to bring negativity to my complaint hub.  
---
\^The logic of people saying "im enjoying the game, leave if you don't" applied to comments.

Nice try bik

It’s very satisfying when I’m playing Minion Master power reaper to have a boneskinner running around with me that’s larger than the bone minions
---
Some weird symbols/textures appear on some of the ice in Bjora Marches, including what looks like a face at the top.
---
I'm on this subreddit for potential bug reports after an update, generic gameplay information (builds, raid/fractal mechanics, hidden achievements, guides etc.) and have fun with drama queens.
---
People must remember some players don't know the existence of this subreddit, instead they enjoy playing instead of reading. I happen to like both, GW2 is one of the best games in the world and this subreddit is one of most enjoyable drama I've ever come across.
---
Well, that might be one way. At least as long as it doesn't mean you are constantly running on timers. And the game felt like that at some point.
---
I mean, I had to play with a website that shows me exactly which event starts when and I was constantly chasing those. This was actually kinda ... stressful. I really don't know why they had such a long cooldown period between events.

F-1 Beetle Racing /s

I did no such thing. I searched for threads of similar ideas and the most recent ones were archived.
---
My idea has nothing to do with a 5 pack of mount skins either, we already have enough of that. 1 unique mount truly encapsulating the heritages and cultures of each race. ONE, not one skin for  every mount, just ONE mount or skin per race, exclusive to the race. That's my suggestion.
---
Can you post some logs? I'm curious to see how you perform in no healer pug runs. From my experience (200+KP pugs) it's always better to run with healer

I used to try and drag new people into the game all the time. Now I question myself really hard if I should keep at it, and how will I look those people in the eyes if what we're witnessing now is really a slow, agonizing death of a game.
---
Daww lookit them babies!
---
For the first time, i am playing engi and had a easy fire field and blast finisher. Every fight, i ends with 25 might. Unless it is some weak ass core enemy who died with before i can even finish setting up my combo.
---
You don't miss tree-stacking on Mossman? That was my favorite part!
---
It's not that easy to get good feedback unfortunately.
---
The majority of the playerbase doesn't read the forums, even less participate in discussions, so the feedback you have is already from the most dedicated of players.
---
While there are some stellar posts with very good points and constructive criticism, not all posts are that level of good, so even among the dedicated you have to choose what to consider and what not.
---
If you're looking for something like WvW with its persistent maps and large scale, Planetside 2 has that but in first person and with guns, knives and sci-fi instead of swords, bows and magic.
---
I mean there has to be some content for epeen seekers. I'd be pretty tilted if someone could get the same celestial infusion I spent hours in CM for by just doing see ez mode shit.
---
No. Why would it change a single thing? I like the game as much as I liked it all these years. 
---
People just have many expectations that aren't accomplished because they dream too big and have no patience:
---
&gt; "We want 20 raids, more fractals, wvsw alliances, proper balance, in-game dps stats, more maps, more stories, bigger maps, lws1 back, the marionette, group-mounts, lfg rework, ui-customizable, contacts rework, guilds rework, more guild halls, new races, new skins, new legendaries **AND WE WANT ALL THAT NOW!**".  
---
Okay, good luck trying to get all those at same time. They will come, but just as they are ready. That's how development works.  
---
/shrugs I just accept it as it's.
---
im just saying,that some ppl think that 3 sec is slow and some ppl dont mind if its 15.
---
Yeah, my biggest complaint about GW2 PvP is that the damage output is so high and the defenses are so low, which is also worsened by glass cannon meta builds that everybody uses, that while self heal utility skills are necessary, they don’t actually help all that much because of how fast paced combat is. There’s no breathing room, you either play fast or you die fast, and that kills any real strategizing in actual encounters. You’re just mindlessly executing a memorized rotation and popping cool downs when you need them and even then, it’s a game of who’s got the right numbers on their side.
---
What makes other PvP centric games so good is that wins and losses per game encounter aren’t instant unless for instance, you’re really good with a high skill maneuver. There’s an actual real time strategy involved in surviving encounters. You don’t die because of dumb mistakes like accidentally being feared within range of a bunch of stacked wells that you’ll instantly die if you step in.
---
Fair point.
---
They would have to hire all new writers if they were to make a Guild Wars single player spinoff. No way I want to play that game with the current team.

Imo, that is an extremely unhealthy psychological behavior. Hard content should be done for the reward of beating it, not the shinies to show off to others or to feel superior. My favorite game, shadow of the colossus, has an extremely laborious extra climb that doesn’t give an achievement or any reward other than making it to the top and it is the single most rewarding game experience I have ever had.
---
good old dungeons times with blasting stealth and might...
---
I uninstalled the game already. Only reason I come here is to watch the train derailing.
---
So anyway I started *whirling*
---
I don't like watching dying MMOs per se, but I enjoy watching the denial that goes on in the communities. I find it fascinating.
---
&gt;If just accumulating abstract numbers is enjoyable enough for someone regardless of the gameplay that is going on, ok fine, I'm not going to judge (but I already did and called it a "hamsterwheel").
---
Dude, seriously? I can't tell if you're being hardheaded or this is just whooshing you.
---
The enjoyment is not from the pursuit of these "abstract numbers" — they serve as a metric to gauge progress within the game and are the result of your activities. If seeing number go up big is all it takes you can just write a quick algorithm in a spreadsheet to fulfill your heart's desires. I mean there are actually really popular click spam games and they make a lot of money for mobile devs. For some people, that's the quick dopamine hit they're after. Having a way to gauge your progression is a core part of almost every game and number go up is the easiest way of showing progression.
---
It doesn't matter how engaging you find a particular activity in a game. Given enough time, you *will* get tired of it. You'll seek out something novel and different. 100 CM is always going to be 100 CM and the instabilities rarely ever change the way you'll handle the encounters. The variables are the pugs you run with and if they're god enough for xyz or not, but it's not really as exciting as you seem to make it out to be. 
---
Sometimes there are balance shakeups which lead to learning a new rotation, sometimes even a new profession/role, or the rare redesign of the encounter itself. Reward design is what draws players to different parts of the game, though. There is so much to do at any given time in GW2 that it's tricky to try and funnel players together for everything. For most cases, general map events and such, almost everything can be easily solo'd by the average player working on story/achievements/collections. 
---
It's the larger scale events which are a bit harder and require collaboration with others. A newer player for example would likely have trouble soloing an Orr temple event which is part of a collection they are working on. It's not a particularly rewarding event chain so it's difficult to pull together players for it. AB meta on the other hand is relatively easy but requires around ~20-40 players to go smoothly across the 4 lanes (yeah yeah it can be done with less). It almost always pulls in a crowd regardless of the time of day because it is so rewarding with both HoT exp for people working on masteries, daily amalgamated, and misc loots. The rewards funnel players together to the events which pay out better.
---
That's what the daily fractal rewards do: They funnel players together for a daily activity. That's part of why it's so rare to see LFGs for misc fractal level progression / collections and why you'll always see groups pop up for the daily resets. Yeah, the gameplay itself can be pretty fun but the reward is the call to action.
---
Druid cannot provide the plethora of boobs that a FB can so they kinda got moved out.
---
Too late, 2 hour WP lore video incoming
---
What I'm tired of is coming here to see practically everyone circling around anything Anet does like vultures so they can chant about "maintenance mode" or whatever new buzzword they got to shit on the game
---
Well that wouldn't be GW3, that'd be a spin off...
---
the handsome Jason leaving?!?!?! :O
---
Credits rolling...?
---
Snipp snipp
---
...How long have you even been playing this game?  Because we JUST GOT new leadership after the layoffs and after Mike O leaving.
---
It was more the symbols themselves that I found interesting, which are pretty likely just reused assets from somewhere else. They can be seen both on mount and off, as long as your graphic settings are high enough.
---
guys  
---
he's still trolling   
---
calm down lmao
---
True, they just look more "friendly" rather than the grisly horror look of GW1. I miss that aspect of minions where they actually look like you raised a monstrosity to fight for you instead of what amounts to the "creepy but adorable" meme.
---
Yeah, I completely agree. Id prefer that amount of detail go into a monstrosity rather than "why is its heart in its mouth? Its kinda cute tho"
---
If they make GW3 single-player, they need to step up their game...a lot.
---
I won't tell you that because it is. Anet seriously struggle with its identity
---
Fixed. Thank you very much!
---
Aurene: "OMG uncle J. Stop stealing my employees."
---
&gt;Yeah, my biggest complaint about GW2 PvP is that the damage output is so high and the defenses are so low, which is also worsened by glass cannon meta builds that everybody uses,
---
I think this is part of the issue, but the crux is a little different. The sheer amount of invulnerability moves in this game causes a serious problem. Rolls, endurance regen, invulns, mesmers, blocks, there's just so many ways to stop damage that it means the game HAS to be built around having extremely high burst damage, just so you can time your attacks to land in the extremely small windows when your opponent isn't invincible.
---
Honestly PvP would have been 10x better if we never had dodge rolling to begin with.
---
In raids all you need is one druid to stack 25 might on 10 people with [Grace of the Land](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grace_of_the_Land). With 100% boon duration they last for 24 seconds and the chrono(s) keep on extending it. Two celestial skill pulse and each pulse stacks two might.
---
Why is a normal mob allowed to instantly knockdown you with no tells from 5000 units away
---
&gt; and we're now granting elementalists and engineers the ability to swap weapons while out of combat
---
This is really incredible QoL for PvE, while a huge game changer for PvP. 
---
It may be OP for Elementalists in PvE, but I'm curious how it will go down for Engineers.
---
Stability would be nice, but what use is superspeed when trying to stomp someone? Lol. The whole spec is in need of a complete rebuild.
---
They gave up on Stronghold before it was released, actually. There were things they were going to change before launch that I guess they never got around to. Then they just never went back to it.
---
Lesser Grenade Barrage on heal skill.  Uhhhh 'kay.
---
Strike missions are done and finished on day one the same way events like AB are. They're not all that challenging or deep, it's just a series of sequences to complete in order to obtain the reward. Grothmar strikes are still run daily by people who want to get the rare armor drops, Bjorn are run daily by people who want more daily Eitrite Ingots (collections/32 slot bags). Who knows if Strikes will stand the same test of time Fractals have, but Fractals have been reworked quite a bit to improve their replayability and reward structure over the years with instance structure, new zones, new masteries, new drops, new instabilities, etc. We already know from the datamine that they have CM structures for Strikes so that's at least one avenue of new potential for them.
---
The "interesting situations" you're imagining in SR are probably not the compelling force to get people to come back to it. When was the last time you saw an SR run in LFG when it wasn't a daily? Solid Ocean might not be all that exciting, but it's quick and painless enough that people don't skip it when it's rotation. I have friends still working on Fractal God / Ad Infinitum / Pristine farming in general who just skip rec days when SR is in rotation :V
---
&gt; Starting at level 10, engineers can now swap weapons while out of combat, gaining an additional pair of weapon slots on their Hero panel.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Starting at level 10, elementalists can now swap weapons while out of combat, gaining an additional pair of weapon slots on their Hero panel.

Can't believe this is finally happening! Gonna be a lot of people losing NNN.
---
1 - If you only have the base game and don't plan to learn fractals or raids. If you have the expansions I'd recommend Thief (Daredevil in specific) above anything due to it being very easy to play and amazing at surviving due to the massive amount of evades and the life leech.   
---
2 - Professions are somewhat balanced, you can get away playing it anywhere. Rangers excel in fractals as Soulbeast Power DPS (provided you perform well enough), as Druids in Raids, they perform really well in PvP too, the only content people avoid using them is WvW.   
---
3 - You can stick to your Ranger. You have the ability to swap between Core Ranger (no elite spec), Druid and Soulbeast anytime you want.  
---
4 - Leatherworker and Weaponsmith if you plan on playing Soulbeast, which I recommend you learn to make it easier to ease yourself into the game, as you will very rarely get the oportunity to play Druid outside of raids.   
---
5 - I'd wait until level 80 as professions can be a bit expensive to max out when starting out. While you can technically make profit while leveling them, it requires knowledge about the Trading Post.  
---
6 - Yes, you can just join up. Just keep in mind that people are much more... "passionate" in GW2 PvP than they are in a WoW BG. Don't feel bad about being a burden for your team though, everyone has to learn.  
---
7 - There are forums and discord servers about RP, you can also ask in the map chat about guilds that focus on it. There is always a handful of people at Salma District that roleplay.  
---
8 - It's the Hero Panel, you press H to open it.   
---
9 - Sorry, I have no experience running the game on Linux.
---
&gt;Utility Goggles: This skill no longer grants fury or provides **immunity to blindness**. It now grants resistance and removes blindness when used. This skill's toolbelt skill has been changed from Analyze to Detection Pulse.
---
Does this apply to the auto stun break Utility Goggles from Tools too? Because if yes, it's such a garbage. Nobody uses this skill and nobody is going to use this skill either. 
---
The only place this skill will be in use is just before a GvG starts and Scrappers try to land reveal on enemy team, then immediately swapped to Purge Gyro.
---
&gt;we're now granting elementalists and engineers the ability to swap weapons while out of combat.
---
*Internal screaming*
---
So that's it? That's all I get? A straw man and some ad hominems?
---
&gt;&gt;Positive Strike: The power coefficient of this skill has been reduced from 0.88 to 0.7.
---
Negative Bash: The power coefficient of this skill has been increased from 0.88 to 1.
---
Equalizing Blow: The power coefficient of this skill has been increased from 1.2 to 1.4.
---
I hope someday we see a good dps benchmark for Scrapper.
---
I thought 250 was the peak, and then they laid off 100+. Even if some of the 100 were typical turnover, the total workforce is probably a lot less.
---
Please rebuild scrapper from scratch.
---
Won't work in PvP.
---
Sounds... \**cough\** useful.
---
This actually sounds pretty damn awesome.
---
I highly doubt you'll be able to pull this off in PvP. Bet it follows the same rule as utility swapping.
---
can you read, friend?
---
1. Easy yes, and it can make you lazy. Keep in mind that a "valid" PvE build isn't necessarily good anywhere else.
---
2. They're acceptable in a variety of content.
---
3. All classes work off of unlocking their elite specialization after 80. It's free to switch from Basic Ranger to Druid or Soulbeast at any time(out of combat).
---
4. Making your own weapons and armor is useful, it can save you gold, but you can ignore it till later if you like.
---
5. Currently buying PoF gets you HoT for free, IDK if that's an ongoing thing or not.
---
6. Yeah it's free join on WvW (BG equivalent) and structured PvP has generally low wait times.
---
7. RP guilds exist, I'm sure someone can drop you an invite.
---
8. H 
---
9. Win10 runs fine, I've only ever dabbled in Linux once.
---
What are you even talking about? game is better than ever, pvp is doing great, it takes me 3 to 5 minutes to find a match, the only thing i hate is most of my team mates run to a wall non stop during the whole match, or some don't know how to jump... maybe we should buy more gems!! to encourage devs to make some tutorials
---
same with wvw, every time i step out of starter waypoing we have a lot of players... standing there in keep... doing nothing... fun gameplay!!
---
but besides how good those game modes are doing, as another reddit user told me the other day, the only game modes that matter are doing great! and those are open world pve farming and the gem stor... i mean the SINGLE PLAYER story mode! so my suggestion, stop spreading fear and go buy some gems!!! support anet and they will deliver... whatever the crap they want but at least they deliver something right? avoiding maintenance mode since 2016 ;)
---
For open world and fractals, Scrapper is still amazing. I don't understand why people keep denying it, even after the spec has received tons of damage buffs to shredder gyro, hammer, and added might stacks to blast gyro.
---
Berserker Scrapper doesn't even need to dodge in fractals. You free up most of your evasion time to keep dealing damage while standing on targets, and shrug everything off. Holo will benchmark higher, and will perform better practically in raids where you rely on support to survive, but I have serious doubts that it actually performs significantly better in fractals.
---
I've been running it for quite awhile since the last rework and it is just stupidly tanky. Nothing interrupts your rotation.
---
Well, since they are mostly dead weapon in combat, I suppose bloodlust sigil will be usefull on them ?
---
they moved it to the daily login, less work, more days to entice you to enter the game.
---
IDK, the former part of that last sentence is a no brainier.
---
Why can't they split this into the different modes?
---
Something something spaghetti code?
---
Something something ineptitude?
---
During times like these I'd be the first to admit that I don't know Jack about programming. 
---
But if they were already able to some splitting in previous patches, why not continue the trend?
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Additional weapon slot for ele! :O
---
This is güd.
---
Too many letters in tooltips, apparently.
---
I’ve done the strikes and they were really easy. I have no idea why people would buy them. I couldn’t figure out how to open the rewards on the new one though 🤷🏻‍♂️ totally not worth it
---
Please rebuild engineer from scratch. FTFY
---
Hate the reveal change, I already swap bomb kit for a smoke if we don't have enough scrappers, ugh.
---
Thieves new job: elementalist respawn camper
---
All the cleanse traits only work on bandage, so probably not.
---
And Braham is puking into a bucket.
---
Oh I completely agree with you. It DOES function well in open world and fractals and such. But not in PvP, due to different mechanics. The "damage for barrier" isn't sufficient in that game mode.
---
Can't seem to edit the title - this is about PvP for the most part everyone. Sorry, should have specified.
---
I really don't understand the fall damage removal. I may have missed something? Core players don't have mounts of gliding. PvP doesn't have gliding either?
---
Fun fact! After they were differentiated in the 2018-07-10 patch, Lesser Lava Font is actually superior to Lava Font on almost all fronts (base damage, power scaling, duration)!
---
Comparing gw2 to a single player game because they are basically the same thing at this point, aye
---
Nice to see the PvP and WvW updates listed separately. 
---
&gt; Traits that affect attributes now display icons that represent said attributes instead of a generic up arrow.
---
We could use something like that next to numbers in skills too. You would be surprised how many people do not know the healing and the damage from life steal are affected separately by power and healing.
---
&gt; Starting at level 10, elementalists/engineers can now swap weapons while out of combat, gaining an additional pair of weapon slots on their Hero panel.
---
Well, now gear loadouts will feel a bit less of a waste for them. Now I can always keep staff and rifle in one slot. That'll save time when I'm going to have to hit something ranged.
---
&gt; Utility Goggles: This skill no longer grants fury or provides immunity to blindness. It now grants resistance and removes blindness when used. This skill's toolbelt skill has been changed from Analyze to Detection Pulse.
---
More revealed skills could use being PBAoE.  For example, "Nothing Can Save You!".  Steath is something, and it can save you from reapers, it only makes sense that a skill meant to bypass defenses would also bypass that one as thieves do not rely on protection or blocks.
---
They completely ignored feedback on falling damage traits, and touted that Griffinrook change like it was the only part of the game affected by their removal.
---
So fucking disappointing.
---
Wow. So many departures. Doesn’t mean the game is dying. Mike Z left and the game is still functioning. Sky isn’t falling. Calm down.
---
It could be if we got a new set every few years. After a while no amount of reworks will get people to do them daily. Well maybe a few people but most people will considered it old content. And well rewards when have rewards really been a thing in this game? It's one of the most common complaints.
---
Okay?
---
So ele and engi have the ability to swap weapons out of combat....
---
So basically the same thing as opening up your inhibitory and double clicking on a weapon... just without pressing I.
---
My friend, get well soon.
---
&gt; I just have the vague notion that there are crafting professions...
---
Here's an important bit of knowledge. Crafting is worthless with 2 exceptions.
---
First, why is crafting worthless? It's worthless because for any item that can be bought/sold on the trading post, the value of the crafting supplies for the item will be higher than the value of the item. So, if you have all of the supplies to craft a Zinc Sword of Asskicking, you can sell the supplies on the trading post, buy the sword on the trading post, and either break even or end up with a bit of money left over. If you *don't* already have the supplies, buying them on the TP will always be more expensive than buying the item on the TP.
---
**Exception 1: Power Leveling**. If you want to buy character levels, it's simple to do by following the guides at gw2crafts.net. The guides are automatically updated every 15 minutes to show the least expensive way to level up each crafting discipline. For each discipline you level up to 400, you'll get 7 character levels, so about 195 gold will get you 56 character levels by following the "Normal" guilds. The "Fast" guides will cost about 250 gold for 56 character levels. Frankly, the Fast guides are 100% worth it unless you really enjoy meticulously following guides for at least an hour. Realistically, doing all 8 Normal guides will be more like 2 hours.
---
This is the reason for the price disparity on the TP for materials vs. finished goods. Every item on the TP was found or crafted by a player. Players craft stuff because they want the crafting XP which is why they're willing to use 2g worth of materials crafting something that's only worth 1g.
---
**Exception 2: Account Bound Items**. There are some items that *can't* be bought/sold on the trading post. This includes things like Ascended weapons/armor (although there are other ways to get them). Those items are the only items you can craft that are "worth" more than the cost of their materials, but they have no value at all unless you need them for your personal use.
---
As a side note, pay attention to the Account Bound gear you get when completing story steps in your personal story. That equipment is [leveling gear](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Leveling_equipment). Basically, it has stats and damage that are at least 4 to 6 levels better than its actual level restriction. So leveling gear armor that has minimum level requirement of level 10 will have the same stats as normal gear (the stuff you get as loot drops) with a min level requirement of level 14 to 16. There's even some Exotic leveling gear that's only minimum level 18, but that has to be crafted. The point is that it's Account Bound, so you can save it for future characters to make it much easier/quicker to level them up, or you can use your first character to craft it for later characters.
---
All I'm trying to say that strike missions could please that crowd if they were a little more challenging, without the need for the increased spectacle that exists in raid wings.
---
"Fall damage" is an exploration thing more than a combat thing, like gliding and mounts. 
---
They started as simple copy of other effects triggering on fall with very niche uses, then they got alternate effects so they could be adjusted separately, then they gave them alternate conditions to trigger then, but they reminded pretty niche.
---
Finally they realized that an exploration ability should not be using up the space that should be used for more useful and varied combat abilities. So they will first remove the fall damage part, and eventually over time rework them into something that works better with the rest of the trait line.
---
yes
---
1. I'd say this is true.
---
2. Professions don't really feel stronger than the next.  It really depends on your weapon, skill and gear selection.
---
3. You need to master your Ranger (which happens by level 80), then you start spending more hero points to learn the Druid Elite Spec.
---
4. Don't worry about crafting professions until you hit level 80.  Too costly to get started with them.
---
5. You can get the expansion at any level.  Buying an expansion will give you a Level 80 booster.  You can use the Level 80 boost on a character just to unlock the Raptor Mount on the first Path of Fire story mission.
---
6. WvW will upscale you to Level 80, but you keep your low-level gear.  SPvP will upscale you and give you top-end gear.
---
7. WoodenPotatoes has a series about Lore in the game.  Go watch some of his videos so you understand the world more.  My RP character is Donald Trumpalump.  He's going to Make Ascalon Great Again and rebuild the Ascalonian Wall and make the Charr pay for it.  He's also engaged in a trade war with Cantha.
---
8. H Key
---
9. Windows Master Race
---
If you're gonna ask me how things *should* be, then I would say all elites should have a place in all modes with different builds. But they're not going to put the work into making that true.
---
Funny thing is they they can hide the pets instead removing them.
---
The effect used for mounts and chairs does that.
---
its the same reason blizzard canceled second diablo3 expansion and go into making diablo4 (later needed to do it again as first version of D4 wasnt good). Its because if internet would say game is shit, even the best, game changing expansion wont change their mind. New game can. Gw2 is considered shit game , with no endgame, or anything to do really.. Expansion wont change that unfair opinion. Also gw2 engin is the source of many problems even something as simple as changing 2 traits in place between 2 trait lines take weeks of coding (devs said that) , they cant just crtl C, crtl V, they need to delete and write from 0...
---
Since this is streaming, your phone wouldn’t know the difference. It’s basically just playing a video stream while sending inputs.
---
you think so? if you go like PoE2 or overwatch2 and do lots of integration, so people wont feel bad leaving gw2, as they will get lots of things in gw3 for playing gw2, it would not be a big problem for veterans. And other , potential new players? I think new game would have way more marketing power then expansion of a game people still consider having nothing to do ("gw2 have no endgame" comments - that naither HoT or PoF changed)
---
7 years fall dmg reduction was OK and than BOOOM,BROKEN ASF/CONFUSING/TOO COMPLICATED&gt;REMOVED. gj
---
Oh sure! But even then a lot of people would keep saying “ded game”. That is what I meant lol
---
 Rampage: Some Rampage skills have been adjusted as follows: 
---
* Kick: Power coefficient has been reduced from 1.2 to 0.01 in PvP only.
---
* Throw Boulder: Power coefficient has been reduced from 2.0 to 0.01 in PvP only.
---
* Seismic Leap: Power coefficient has been reduced from 1.6 to 0.01 in PvP only.
---
* lmao
---
too much challenge and none will do it again. moreover you must add reasons to do it. strike in new map do not drop anything interesting. i stopped doing it.
---
get raid boss and change to strike. same drops and same reward i can guarantee u will find run every hour
---
point of view. it is to me. you wanted a new raid. i did not. i got new content
---
Yeah, I agree with that.
---
It's mainly not viable in pvp because the barrier conversion only works if you can fight uninterrupted. In pvp, you have an awkward engage with no barrier, and a CC will cause your barrier to drain. So it ends up not really working.
---
Should maybe give us a fall damage mastery at the same time they remove the traits instead of Soon™, but that's just my opinion.
---
Crafting no longer gives xp? I remember leveling cooking with my first character cause I wanted lvl 80 faster
---
Well that explains a lot, thanks!
---
I actually didn't know that before
---
Absolutely.
---
I just can't believe they haven't been parallel developing the single player instances as fractals. A lot of them could be split up into smaller sections or even just plopped into a fractal full stop. Especially the ones with the bosses. Kralky, the one from season 5 episode 2, The end of Joko's Palace.
---
So, they just made functionality splits to mesmer and necromancer skills between gamemodes, rather than just numbers. Can we please now get back some skill functionality lost in PvE due to PvP? Like CoR hitting 5 targets per section instead of 5 targets total?
---
Then you'll have to stop playing with guardians :')
---
If you don't have a symbol down, you're not doing it right. :&gt;
---
I can't belive i find this cute :D
---
Dead game lol
---
As if it's not already here lol
---
It was. The spots where it was useful got it re-implemented in other way.
---
Crafting still gives xp afaik too.
---
well yeah you can do all that with just one press of a button now. It's a major QoL improvement for many
---
This change is fine actually. The charge and auto attack remain unchanged, which means that rampage users now have to decide between hard-cc or damage. I think it's a fair change. A cc skill hitting for &gt;6k Dmg? A bit overkill in my opinion
---
They already have it now with gear templates, so this is just a given qol update.
---
Yeahh there's always those kinds of people around lol. But launch was great, beta was amazing. They had so much steam and could have started working on end game instead of trying living story. I like the story aspect, don't get me wrong, but they emphasize so much on it that it's all they develop. A new map every 2-4 months to dick around in for a week or two and a story development with a usual cliffhanger. Hell, holiday events are the same old grind as the year before with little to no difference in content.
---
I haven't played in a couple months, I haven't had much interest in the new LS update. I wish they redirected resources from gem store + story to fixing the game and revamping everything so it can survive. Asking the community for a little ray of hope is just stalling the inevitable. All that needs to be done is admit that the direction of the game is not good and fix it, make the game fun again. I miss getting on with my friends and having fun trying to complete content.
---
WHAT THE HELL reddit, an actual post merely talking about lore and suggestions is at 0, 38% upvotes? get fucked the lot of you... you know who you are.
---
&gt; nothing that couldn't be done with gear templates
---
But it makes each template slot better. Say you have 2 power (full zerk) builds, one with staff and one with dd. Now use a single template for both without having to use 2 slots for nearly same gear.
---
if you weapon swap to a set without the same on kill sigil as the other, it goes away.
---
Oh my bad I thought it was running on his phone
---
There's mastery points obtainable in core free areas.
---
Maybe it could be as part of a set of masteries available to free and core players to give them a taste of the system and entice them a bit more to get expansions.
---
You're an idiot.
---
1. More or less, although it's probably the hardest of the three you listed. Still, having a pet to tank for you is very forgiving, so you should manage just fine.
---
2. I can't speak for the early years, but nowadays "weaker" and "stronger" only really matters for harder endgame content. Ranger has more than enough tools and power to get the job done, and it certainly isn't notably weaker than any other profession as far as I'm aware.
---
3. You can swap back and forth as much as you want; Elite Specs aren't so much separate classes as modifiers you can apply to the base class, and they don't require separate leveling (although they can take a while to fully unlock).
---
4. Crafting isn't really something you need to worry about early on, although if you're interested it can be a good source of gear and supplementary XP. Leatherworker, Huntsman and Weaponsmith are most relevant to a Ranger, but if you'd rather give it a pass just remember to salvage any gear you don't plan to use and hold on to the materials - it will save you time and money in the long run.
---
5. Not really - all the expansion content is level 80, so before that you wouldn't really be able to do anything with it anyway.
---
6. Not really my area of expertise, but you've got the right general idea - structured PvP has fixed levels and stats, so your PvE level doesn't matter. WvW is a bit more complicated, but as a general rule each mode has its own progression completely divorced from the others.
---
7. There's a LFG option for it, and probably a subreddit or forum somewhere, so that's probably your best bet. I've noticed the most RPers in the major cities, for what it's worth.
---
8. That would be the H key (for "Hero").
---
9. Not a Wine expert, but there's a good chance that's the engine rather than your OS. GW2s engine is pretty solid in most areas, but tends to freak out when there are lots of particle effects going on or more than 10 or so players on screen at once, which can lead to a rather inconsistent framerate. Mess with the player model settings and such if it's a major issue, otherwise you'll just get used to it after a little while.
---
Mike O left, Mike Z is still there. Get your Mikes correct.
---
impossible. there is no way you will be able to top dps every boss with the same build without changing something on it. that's not how this game and most mmos work. you can perfect rotation on largos as a power dps and a mirage is probably going to beat you just because of how the boss is made. you're trolling if you're upset that you cant top dps every boss with the same "min-max" build.
---
They both left you stupid bitch!
---
AR should have been mastery like from the beginning.
---
It could have been done with achievements, since there were no masteries back then.
---
But there is no reason it cant be turned into a mastery now.

Isn't Jason the awkward hunk that would squirm during the Guild Chat about Joko's bone sounds?
---
Cool guy, a shame to see him go. I wish him the best in his future endeavors.
---
No Mike Z hasn't left..
---
Until the mob move to FFXIV because they done with GW2 and now want to sink FFXIV reddit instead. People actually do this on purpose which is kind of mindblowing to me.
---
That deadly ambition change is gonna make shortbow thief sad.
---
we only had to wait like 7 odd years! totally worth the wait
---
Most JPs already allow the glider so you don't need it really
---
*sigh*
---
OK, the Signet of Undead changes started out great... and then quickly devolved into utter shit and capped off with a "huh, can't complain" change.
---
Reducing the amount of allies you can rez from 3 to 1 across every game mode is just fucking stupid. Who's going to want to waste a 75s cooldown for ONE person? Might as well as just stop and rez the normal way.
---
I actually saved two of my pugs with this skill a few days ago, and with the shitty 3 second cast time. Which was punishing enough. 
---
I rather they keep it the way it is than reduce the ally cap PLUS the addition of a 50% base HP cost. I just can't see this skill being useful anymore beyond another "slot this skill you're never going to click because the passive is actually better than the active".
---
Literally there is.

&gt;one step closer to weapon swap while infight for the ultimate piano gameplay

Holy shit are you delusional.

Still codes left!
---
1. I love the use of dingus lol
---
2. Dead serious. He left almost a month ago.

Engineer rotations jsut got that much more complicated.

Did they add it for griffinhook run somehow?

[Black Lion Chest/historical](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Chest/historical)
---
* 2018-11-13 to 2018-12-11
---
* 2017-12-12 to 2018-01-09
---
* 2017-11-07 to 2017-12-12
---
So *maybe* soon.
---
Annoying as it is, its kinda how ANet seems to do a lot of their skill updates: we get some seemly arbitrary change that doesn't make any sense (and they don't elucidate their future intentions at that time) until months later when they update the game with the *rest* of the changes...
---
So, who knows what it'll be. The second part of the whole "falling damage" thingy will show up within probably the next 3-5 months, like... a Tyrian Mastery or something else that is taking them much longer to implement.
---
The secondary effects are so weak that they are not worth taking over other traits.
---
&gt; Dungeons - long gone, officially dead, /// good. few people actually wanted to do them in the first place.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Fractals - it's been a year, since the last one /// good, see "dungeons."
---
&gt; Raids - gutted high end community, /// not gutted enough, there's still work to do. They need an alternate path for Envoy armor.
---
&gt; Guilds -Abandoned, /// They added a new Hall with PoF, and keep adding new decorations you can add. There's not a whole lot I can think ot add to them.
---
&gt; Ascended gear - not even necessary (except t4 fractals) /// Ok?
---
&gt; Masteries - more and more specific to one map/region (not horizontal progression -&gt; because it's NOT character progression! it's only "map" progression and in the wrong way: making it easier, not harder /// I don't know, they are trying to keep old masteries relevant, but I do think that there is some value to having progression within the new content, a system where you start out at "less than you need to be" and then earn "the level that you need to be," without it being linear stacking on top of the core builds in a way that a player who clears all of HoT is significantly stronger at PoF content than one who skipped HoT entirely.
---
&gt; PvP - no esport community since esl, secondary playmodes like stronghold and 2v2 never really supported (swiss not coming) /// Also great news.
---
&gt; WvW - no updates since HoT launch? /// Thank Aurene. Hopefully they'll let it fade out.
---
"All replayable content that keeps games alive is dead... and here's why that's a good thing: Because I do not care about it."
---
&gt;We're just talking basic concepts here. You seemed to completely reject the concept that a story chapter could be considered less than the whole, so I pointed out a story told on a long time scale that ended on a cliffhanger and was fine.
---
Except the example you pointed out is not valid. Books that come out years appart still have resolutions and conclusions of their own, same for multi season arcs, individual seasons come out sooner than 4 months, infinity war had a plan, an arc and proper stakes and literally every single example you brought has more story than 30 minutes every 4 months.
---
&gt;Agreed.
---
* Who is E?
---
* Is the Pale Tree still dying and we don't care anymore?
---
* What about the Mad Soul in GW1 who predicted that Kormir would kill the other gods to start the cycle again?
---
&gt;It resolved the immediate threat, the "little bad" that had caused all the immediate conflict over this episode. It's no different than on a show where you have a "monster of the week,"
---
Here's the thing, you know why monster of the week is called that? Because episodes come out every week. Not every 4 months.
---
&gt;Again, lore. 
---
Again, gameplay &gt; lore
---
&gt;It didn't cost us a mastery either.
---
Anet has a checklist of 1 mastery per episode, so yes it did. It was either this or something else.
---
&gt;Again, death in this game has never been a serious problem, barely an inconvenience. And I wouldn't want it any other way.
---
God forbid the game have any sort of stakes or challenge?
---
&gt;Ok, you can have that opinion, nobody is saying you can't. 
---
The thing is, its not really an opinion, you're free to like a story but the instant you start examining it critically, you notice that its filled with deus ex machinas, dropped plot points, asspulls, retcons, hacky dialogue and flat characters. Its not good by any stretch of the imagination.
---
&gt;Again, that's your opinion. I think that for the most part it's been an enjoyable year.
---
According to what metric? Story wise they solved the plot that was building up for 5+ years of the clashing dragon energies with an asspull and a deus ex machina at the same time story wise, and content wise this has been among the dryest years in gw2 history.
---
&gt;You're confusing some stuff. Verbal feedback is important, because it lets them know how to change things, but data is important too. Some people have been asking for "replayable content," by which I guess you mean instances, or something, but most people have been relatively happy with the content they've been putting out. They see what things players do, and what things players don't do, so they know what is and is not working. Verbal feedback helps them decide what to do about it, but just because they've been ignoring you doesn't mean they are ignoring the players.
---
Here's a fun little bit of information that just came out. [The lead living world (Which includes "sagas") designer just quit.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e2b7ov/from_his_instagram_guess_jason_reynolds_lead/) 
---
[Merely 2 weeks after the lead PvE boss designer left.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dv56c3/crystal_reid_raid_designer_pve_boss_designer_has/?utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=Guildwars2&amp;utm_content=t1_f8uk9xh)
---
And this is [not even a full month after the founder of the company and executive producer of the game left the company.](https://massivelyop.com/2019/10/03/mike-obrien-is-leaving-arenanet-and-guild-wars-2-to-form-a-new-studio/)
---
Clearly, most people are perfectly happy and the game is clearly doing extremely well and everything is working great since they are listening to all that feedback!
---
Oh but lemme guess your response based on everything else you've said:
---
"These people were holding the game back, good riddance the game will be better off whithout them and don't let the door hit their ass on their way out."
---
Im quite happy about the change, the thing is Cancer mesmer is rly bad to fight for meele classes or classes with bad cleansing. I understand ur consern but look on the pvp meta now and u see C mesmer was to strong.
---
Logging in now just to stand around in town to swap weapons for 30 minutes.
---
I feel like we're watching the studio bleed out slowly and it's sad.
---
The OP didn't, but then his post isn't about just what he said. There are dozens of posts all over the place where people are essentially speaking as if they're speaking for everyone. I didn't create a new thread. I'm responding to someone else's.  That's a difference, even if you don't see it.
---
&gt; I currently use for the main monitor (2 monitor set up) a 27" IPS at 1920 x 1090 resolution
---
I see tremendous differences between 1080p and 1440p on this display size in daily use, and differences are also quite high in games, especially ones with worse anti-aliasing. 4k... will depend on your pickiness, really, I only notice pixels on 2k if I focus on them; that said, any upgrade from 1080p for such sizes would be great.
---
There's nothing really OP about this in PvE, I have been carrying a staff, sword, and dagger ever since PoF came out. It's some nice QoL so I don't have to fiddle with my inventory and find which slots my sword and dagger went to when I need my staff.
---
The idea that he says the game is dying, when in fact, it's just maybe dying for raiders and PvPers...or hard core guys is significant. The game isn't dying for everyone, or everyone doesn't agree. He says "rightfully so". Indicating he knows what will happen in the future. He may believe it, but you know, games have a lot less population than this and make a lot less money and continue on, with content updates even.
---
I did laugh a bit that they reduced it to 0.01 rather than just removing the damage entirely. Feels very "Smiter's Boon".
---
Do you count condition aoe dmg applied in 1 hit? Signet of Fire seems prety good :)
---
No, its not like that u use in PvP all thre traits what i named out of serveal reasons, by ranger is it the extra condi clean and the immb and slowness. By Weaver is it for better sutain in fight, because u swap near to every 2 second. By Mesmer espacily CMesmer u use it for the boons and the condition to pessuer ur enemy more.
---
Staff/Staff abusing Quick Pockets/Acrobatics was the worst possible thing that could happen to Staff Thieves that used neither.
---
The game does a piss poor job of explaining itself in game. More people would be better if there was more in game tutorial/explanation.  Expecting people to have to go outside the game to learn basics, to me anyway, is not good design.
---
I'm not even a PvP player and Anet would be crazy to ever give Ele weapon swapping in combat.
---
Yeah, they talked on the forum with us over there plans. And we gave them some proper feedback. U are right there stand not that much new, but that is only for give a inform befor the patch what will come and for let us now when it comes.
---
The map's world boss (karka queen) spawns every 3 hours so probably most people show up around then.
---
&gt; and capped off with a "huh, can't complain" change.
---
What's the can't complain change?
---
While writing this I literally thought to myself "I bet this guy ad homs me to try to invalidate my argument."
---
I guess at least your username is a good forewarning.
---
Condi Staff Mirage Mesmer isn't really even meta. Axe/Scepter w/ Pistol/Torch is the meta for condi mesmer. Staff Mesmer has a very slow ramping speed compared to other condi builds. 
---
Anyone with blocks, reflects, or condi clense can counter Staff Mesmer pretty easily, but a lot of people keep just doing pure power builds instead of making a build to help counter other builds.
---
The patch is coming next week, no? They are just releasing the notes earlier as they have been doing for a while now.
---
I am more talking about staff/staff infinity horizon builds. Most of the damage in the meta builds aren't coming from staff.
---
I was thinking of Lord Taeres shadow on mine.
---
"Fall damage mastery" is the best thing I've ever heard.  
---
"You may trip me, you may knock me down, BUT KNOW THIS!  I have mastered falling, and you shall weep when I get back up."
---
I remember a while back seeing a PvP or WvW clip where someone baited people into jumping off a cliff to continue the chase. The guy that baited the other had the fall damage trait while the 4 or 5 people who followed did not. While it's amusing, it's also kinda bullshit.
---
Only tenth? Pfft, these are rookie numbers.
---
Yeah but that do not changed the fact that staff is part of the meta build from C Mesmer. And with that a soild point to nerf it. U can actully nerf scepter or the shatter but yeah. (EU btw.)
---
Hello. Im the person that asked you for Plant like mounts (Now, please, draw a set of plant-animal (like fern hound) mount skins XD).
---
I think you got a good beetle version but the others need something more appealing.
---
Some suggestions:
---
Raptor - Mordrem Guard Mount
---
Springer - Iboga
---
Skimmer - Waterlilly "surf"
---
Jackal - Fern hound
---
Griffon - Jacaranda
---
Beetle - your water melon version is awesome
---
Warclaw - MossHeart
---
Skyscale - Shadow of the Dragon
---
You can also check TESO "Wild Hunt" mounts for more inspiration.
---
Should be more than enough for GW2. Other games will need lower settings.
---
Sword and shield :p
---
I don't but we can guess that anet has internal map building and scripting tools for the content teams. 
---
&gt; otherwise we would probably see a lot more of them. 
---
Designing fractals is not easy. You have to account for different difficulties and it has to work with instabilities. Also you might need new art asses, voice acting, gfx and new boss mechanics. So i assume that new Fractals are actually quite work intensive. The last one they added had all of the above and is pretty fun (and a bit on the hard side).
---
necros already get great sword, its time for some shitty weapons like shortbow, too many swords..
---
Even better, what they should do?  Have the escort event spawn Icebrood/Svanir, then have the step after that be clearing out the Fallen mobs in the ruins near the forest, THEN have the "clear out the Abberant mobs" event, and then spawn the Boneskinner.  This way players can get a full charge of every one of the essences, and then everyone should be prepped to murder the Boneskinner's break bar for the achievement.
---
*Deep breath*...
---
.
---
...SCRAPPER BUFFS!
---
Gamechanger for stealth blasting in WvW though.
---
Triple Trouble is 3 heads, Bubbles might be a hydra... Worms definitely are the eyes of the Deep Sea Dragon.
---
&gt; Revenant is pretty fun. I mean, you can play it as braidead alacrity bot, but there are a lot of things that can be done on top of that.
---
I play Revenant now since it's the closest I can get to playing Chronomancer in Fractals, but it just isn't the same.
---
&gt;People keep saying this as if it were fact, "the game needs 'replayable content,' 
---
That's because it is?
---
&gt;No it does not.
---
Yes it does. Replayable content is what keeps players playing a game accross literally every singe game meant to be played more than once.
---
&gt;The simple fact is that most players do not engage with ANY of that content, EVER, so if the game "needed" that content to survive, then it would already be dead.
---
Like 100 people got canned, the lead designer for PvE bosses quit, the lead designer for open world quit, the founder of the company quit and 90% of the gamemodes haven't been updated in nearly a year if not longer.
---
&gt;As did Whisper in the Dark.
---
You do realize that even anet said that whisper in the dark was not meant to resolve anything right? They've said that the reason the episode exists is to open up future plots.
---
&gt;Not typically, it depends on how they roll out, but even the longest seasons only take up half the year, so either they release all episodes and then take half a year off, or they release ~8 episodes, take 1-2 months off, ~6-8 more, 1-2 months off, ~8 more, and then a 3-4 month summer gap. And that's not even considering the shorter 8-12 episode seasons.
---
A single episode out of any bundle of episoides from any of these serials is longer than a whisper.
---
&gt;I'd like to know the answers to these things. I actually believe the Saga system is the best way to answer them. These were always tricky to tackle using the old episode system, since they had to be too focused on "advancing the plot" of the moment,
---
Um. You do realize that saga is literally the exact same thing as living world but with a new name yes?
---
&gt; but I think it's overall quite good for an MMO that has to handle all the varieties of player choice in an efficient way. 
---
What player choice? No choices you make actually mater or affect the plot in the slightest. They briefly tried that in the personal story (which only led to branching paths, not branching endings) then completely ditched the concept alltoogether.
---
&gt;True, This would be "monster of the quarter."
---
&gt;Otherwise the same though.
---
"Except for this overwhelmingly massive difference that literally makes or breaks the concept its named after its otherwise the same."
---
&gt;And it is your opinion that it containing those elements is a bad thing. 
---
No it isn't. Writing has actual rules and standards that have been cemented over centuries from the best stories that make the most cohesive narratives.
---
&gt;Nope.
---
You're playing a game not reading a book. 
---
You don't even have the excuse of this being bioshock because the story here is shit.
---
&gt;According to my own personal opinion, just as your position is by the metric of your own personal opinion.
---
Except my position isn't based on my own personal opinion. Its based on the objective factual ammount of content that was released.
---
&gt;That was basically how I expected them to solve it, so that didn't bother me. 
---
Bad writing not bothering you doesn't stop it from being bad writing.
---
&gt;In the past 12 months we've gotten eight story episodes, each with their own maps,
---
Which are completely superficial and vapid and after you do map completion there is no reason to return to them ever.
---
&gt;two new mounts, a new raid, 
---
In a vacuum? Good. In a year? Bad.
---
&gt;and several returning festivals. 
---
You mean already existing content that we've already played?
---
&gt; People come and go from companies all the time, 
---
Ah yes, the lead designer for living world which is literally the only thing anet is currently focusing on meaning the saga is going to be without a him, leaving? Completely normal.
---
The CEO, Lead Open world designer and lead boss designer all living with a month of one another? Also completely normal. 
---
People in high ranking positions do not jump ship en mass from successful companies.
---
Also JP claims that the decision to make LS5 happened during the LS4 planning. Its just that they started LS4 planning with that being uncertain, came up with a skeleton story that could work either way, and ended up mostly keeping that.
---
A "Lead" doesn't mean the same at every company. Either way it's not a management or even a leadership position. Many times it's simply used to denote someone who is the team SME or p picnic face of a team. Sometimes it's a technical lead. Rarely, if ever, is it a true leadership position.
---
The other thing being discounted here is reason why someone leaves. The Gaming and Tech industries are extremely competitive when it comes to hiring. If someone is good enough talent, it's usually not hard for another company to poach taken by simply giving a better offer than the existing employer can match.
---
Sometimes people also just leave because they want to do something new or they are better at starting companies than running them. The team behind Torchlight left Runic Games to start a new company, yet they are still working on the new Torchlight game for PWE.
---
There's a lot we don't know.
---
What happens when you're in game and try to access the HoT content / start the HoT story? The website may just not reflect what's going on in game.  If it's still giving you issues there I would contact support and ask them.
---
The kernel of truth? is that she did claim that when they first started planning LS4, they were not sure if there would be an LS5 or not, which guided them to come up with a story that could work if the game happened to end. That they weren't sure if there would be an LS5 (let alone an expansion) tells you exactly how "invested" they were in ongoing GW2 content at the time.
---
