Clearly the way this will end is that we trick Kralkatorrik into eating Menzies and then the Balthazar energy and the Menzies energy start fighting each other inside of him and Kralkatorrik has to go lie down and take a nap for a few thousand years to shake off the indigestion.

There are some pretty dangerous ideologies in the world nowadays, but last I checked the Social Justice crowd wasn't the one shooting up places of worship on the regular.
---
A non gemstore mountskin? Never!
---
Character creator doesn't determine your profession beside its kind; you'll work towards your specializations (kind of skills tree) during regular gameplay. You can chose 3 specializations from pool of 7 on each profession (5 core, 2 elite specializations coming from each expansion). Bottom (third) specialization slot is reserved for expansions elite specialization and only one elite can be active at the time; using either of two grants you access to weapons previously not available to your profession (warhorn or sword on elementalist, for example).
---
"" work to achieve social justice. " yeah no. Justice should always be individual. Will not support"
---

---
That is literally your opening post in this thread.  If you don't see how that is starting off with a nasty attitude I don't know what to say.
---
Gold and WvW in the same sentence just makes me so sad.  I've even written out paragraphs outlining how they need to handle it but got no replies back.  I don't know what to say anymore or if I should even care.
---
It will be 5 about half of the defense portion with Hero of the Wastes. For RIBA gold to really kick in you need to kill Vinewrath once. It only comes truly good gold after 1 Vw.
---
If you feel like a bunch of 15 year olds on tumblr are a danger to you but not the racists shooting up churches then I dunno how much we can trust your threat assessment abilities
---
The difference is that gw2 raid bosses are probably 90% dependent on mechanics and only 10% dependent on gear.
---
Most of my big skins were gifts from friends in the game. I remember when I was new I unlocked many dyes out of donation too! One of my first friends in game bought me Hot cause I couldn't afford it and my other best friend gave me Gw1 so I could hunt for the fire sword. Many other guildies helped me to get the points required for it too! These are all people I've never meet irl.
---
 I can't get over how many nice people I meet in this game. I know I can never play frequently enough to give them return gifts just as good so I do my best to be a a good friend, a nice player and help whoever else need my help.
---
The newbies I help nowadays get so happy from the dyes and other small things I give them and I always think like "you have no idea how little this is compared to the kindness I was shown".
---
This game was designed not to abuse players money wise and the community shows the great result from that. I feel like praising the devs everyday for this big decision they made in their business model and mostly of course, the community for not being selfish like we are so used to see in other games!
---
oh really? im sorry i dont remember buying the HoT
---
I'm sure you know a lot about this charity and exactly the things they believe and represent and aren't just making up a boogyman.
---
Get real dude.
---
That's what I have now, it's just not the same. But I'm being picky.
---
Yeah, the only worthwhile map is Istan which was already nerfed because it was too good... you know... instead of buffing other maps.
---
oof
---
I also just realised they chopped off the thief! Blasphemy!
---
No hardcore grinding at all - that isn't fun! In fact, I would guess 300 hours + were spent chilling with my girlfriend on Teamspeak :)
---
It's just simply my nature to be efficient, all my gold is made while I'm asleep on the Trading Post, so I don't need to farm it. And every time I play, it's to do a fun and exciting achievements - there's probably 2,000AP+ that I'll never get because I'd rather play like Apex Legends or some games on my PS4 than waste that time doing silly mini-games or GW1 content. 
---
My favourite part is doing 100% of Living Story Achievements when they come out with my girlfriend. The collection puzzles are really rewarding!
---
Thank you! I am doing my best o7
---
Yea you are. Probably never even skipped mechanics in CM100 lul.
---
Yeah, i know they are out there, i just don't want to spend my time trying to find them tbh.. i don't have a lot of playing time right now so I'd rather spend my time knocking out dailies and finding mats..ihope one day soon i will make that step to find another home though :)
---
Kralkatorrik on the last page. It looks like you put some serious work into that. It's amazing.
---
Welcome to the 30k club!
---
So we shouldn't help people if it might spark political debate?
---
We shouldn't support a charity for homeless or suicidal LGBT youths because it can be seen as "political"?
---
Helping people and politics are not always mutually exclusive. In fact, it never is.
---
Yeah isn't it like almost harriers and 1 magi ring/accessory? Haven't checked in awhile.
---
&gt;Fairly certain with full harrier and pots in fractals you over cap on boon duration
---
Yep, that's what I said.
---
&gt; Oils are better
---
Eh
---
&gt;You say you die a lot.
---
Never implied that, all I said was that I'd rather be safe than sorry and not minmax too much. I'm a pretty casual person so I don't really care about pushing damage.
---
Turning it into a public event is kind of how they get the funds to donate in the first place, genius.
---
&gt;People can gain without other people needing to lose anything. That's the difference between distribution and redistribution.
---
What's even your point here? 
---
If you intervene in the distribution of any resource you have re-distributed them.
---
If you don't intervene you havn't done anything.
---
Explain to me how you think you can intervene without it being considered re-distribution.
---
Flipping tp
---
Should be fine. Could always be verbose in what's being sent in the mail or via whispers. People do this all the time to sell Gifts of Exploration. I never had any issues selling two Gifts.
---
Think youd be fine. If they were really worried they would just look into the activity on your friends account and see it's not a bot.
---
I think ANet will not bat an eye. But I must ask...why make a legendary only to sell it :p
---
&gt;You arent being unjustly treated simply by existing, that is moronic. 
---
So then what would you call a kid being kicked out and shunned by their family for being gay and then the system failing to help them if not being treated unjustly for simply existing?
---
&gt; they would just look into the activity on your friends account and see it's not a bot.
---
Like i said though all they do is farm and craft legendaries, they said someone in their guild got a 7 day ban on review atm for trading 45 ecto stacks for a legendary with someone.
---
tis but a drop :)

Man now I appreciate more this ascendant boxes that fractals had gave me, I got 4 full sets until now.
---
Again
---
&gt;If you want to argue the definition take it to Google/Wikipedia, not me.
---
Until then, sorry  but I'm going to trust the literal dictionary definition more than a random on the internet.
---
Cheers.
---
Thanks for the reply, I got a usb3 and am downloading the game to it right now. Fingers crossed the load times are too terrible.
---
Wait, I'm not familiar with this part. Where is she in that instance?
---
 I have 1,7k hours but only around 8k AP,big oof
---
&gt; Why exactly would any of that be less credible than a dictionary
---
1) You havn't provided any.
---
2) You havn't proven that it is more or less credible either.
---
That being said, you seem irrationally invested in this discussion and keep bringing up communism for some reason. I don't think this will lead anywhere healthy so im going to quit, you can treat this however you like.
---
Hope you can find your peace.
---
They don't NEED them, but they can be done and nothing is harmed by certain explanations. Certainly it is better than the mixed muddled bag that is Dragon's Stand.
---
&gt;Diversity has always been portrayed with respect in GW2, from Kasmeer and Jory's relationship to Taimi's health problems. We never had any problems.
---
There are people who disagree and say their relationship is "sjw propaganda" just by itself for essentially no reason other than they're a lesbian couple that exists. You need to realize that for some, ANY representation is "too much" or "too political."
---
&gt;This subreddit isn't your battlefield for identity politics.
---
I didn't know you were a mod of this sub and could tell people what they can/can't talk about.
---
This means the new episode drops in Two weeks?
---
The titles can have multiple meanings or one really dumb one. Like "A Star to Guide Us" is just a reference to the big character moment in that episode. YES, it also references an Olmakhan saying, but that has zero impact on the story, which is one of the reasons why I rolled my eyes so hard when I realized that's what they were doing.
---
Not saying there isn't room for the Eternals, they certainly wouldn't need any developer time to make (tint the Ascalonian ghosts an ugly shade of teal and you're good), but I'm not really sure that's what they're going for. Even if they are, what would the Eternals be doing fighting Kralkatorrik unless they were fighting him forever in this fractal state we set up? We can't kill Kralkatorrik anymore, not safely anyhow. so any fight  is going to need a new bottle to put the Kralk juice or keep him busy forever.
---
How you do this magic
---
There is no individual leaderboard for specific matches. All you see are your raw stats and below that the percentages compared to your team etc. 
---
The names in the grid are probably arranged alphabetically, by join time, or just random like you said. 
---
While top stats are nice to get, they shouldn’t be the metric by which you judge whether you played well or not. Focus on being in the right places at the right times and winning fights.
---
[Condition firebrand](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition/) is better in viper unless you're going for something specific or don't happen to have [HoT](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-29808). If you do decide to go viper (which I suggest) take a look at[ this guide on gearing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character). If you still want grieving there is a long [list on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grieving) to look at but many options especially exotics are expensive or hard to get. IMO you're better off gearing another stat set for now (like rabid or a power firebrand in cheap berserker) while you work on ascended gear.
---
People who play for 6 years do not need a lvl 60 scroll
---
I want to use this and I don't even plan to stream.  Can you make it so that when I stomp a player in wvw or pvp the lower left character walks out and gives me a thumbs up.  It'd be cool to see that once or maybe twice a year.
---
I haven't read your post about it, but I think simply adding a small amount of actual gold in the pip reward chests, similar to that of pvp, but a much lower amount, woild be nice. Say 25-40g per full week (I think it would greatly outcap the pvp pips, since they're slower to accumulate (or so it feels) and it's capped at season, rather Than weekly.
---
What were your thoughts? Would be able to tl;dr or perhaps link where you posted?
---
&gt; What's WvW?
---
some might say it's a large scale player vs player experience where 3 factions fight for supremacy..some call it a PvD(player vs door) or PPT(points per tick) fest..oh or that place you **have** to go to when you want to make a legendary
---
&gt; What's a fractual?
---
nobody knows
---
&gt; What do you do once you hit level 80?
---
delete and start again..according to some people leveling the normal way is very important so keep doing it
---
&gt; How do you start getting really good gear?
---
credit card or in-game gold, sometimes achievements or rng
---
&gt; What do I need to start researching to go from being a lvl 80 nobody, to running raids with confidence?
---
i made a short [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/akqzij/how_to_get_into_raiding/ef7ejou/) and i'm also working on an encounter-specific guide but i've been so busy doing nothing i haven't had the time yet..work in progress
---
Elder dragons are one way to maintain balance. We were working on a different way based on sharing magic freely rather than elder dragon cycles of death and rebirth. Now we will probably need to work on a third way, assuming we can get Kralkatorrik out of the picture.
---
[Good find, those are pretty rare.](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Skill_Pin)
---
You can get ascended gear in wvw.
---
The price you have to pay for it is quite high.
---
Crafting is in most cases still the cheapest way to get ascended gear.
---
We should just be able to buy asc. gear boxes for a cheaper price.
---
That way we dont pay extra for a skin.
---
Better than the useless magic find and bag of gear.
---
Gratz!
---
I messed up the drop down after 5 and slid down the slope, so I reckon I can shave 5-6 seconds if I can squeak out a perfect run.

---
No way there's another side to this story.  yep yep yep.
---
I thought it it like we all knew this was our only good chance period to take him down, what's the best place to do it? His eye most likely. LIke it was such a desperation move, we were accepting ANY CHANCE to do some damage and hopefully take him out. I read the sotry a bit deeper than how it's presented to us, that we're improvising a lot of shit on the fly, and just GOING with it because we don't have time, and we really have little to no idea what could work. 
---
On the same note, i thought the resonance thing was supposed to do the damage to him. I thought we were going to crack and shatter Kralky like how you'd shatter glass with a high frequency and we only disoriented him twice and the third time he legit didn't give a shit for some reason. I suspect maybe that's cause he changed his own resonance to withstand a third blast? That'd be a cool explanation. 
---
I guess in the end we thought the resonance blasts were fucking his whole body up.
---
They may not save chat logs which is stupid anyway so idk.
---
In the case of how Dragon's work, you actually couldn't. Dragon's eat magic, her magic (supposedly if eating Joko wasn't a ting and they wanted to completely kill her off) was eaten by Kralky when she died. Just like how Joko couldn't die, but Aurene just fully ate him, with completely obliterated his magic and fully killed him. 
---
There is no place in the afterlife we can go to find her, or at least there WWOULDN'T be if ...again, Joko's Resurrection magic wasn't assimilated into Aurene when she LEGIT devoured him whole.

Here we examine the siamoth in its natural habitat. An expert climber for certain.
---
You can clears raids just fine on exotic gear. Learning raids prob takes 10-20 minutes if you're commited to listen to people talk. 
---
Magnetite Shard cap is 150, and Gaeting Crystal cap is 100, and turning in minis or salvaging weps/gear ignores this cap. 
---
It isn't hard, it's only difficult if people don't learn stuff.
---
Pretty much any class is viable if you’re soloing to 80, pre 80 core Tyria is pretty forgiving and most maps have active populations to help with the group events. 
---
Genuinely best option is to pick one you like the look/sound of and have a crack rather than try to meta your way to the end. 
---
Having said that some classes have an easier learning curve than others - LB - sword/axe ranger and GS / mace/shield warrior are very easy to play, offer a nice mix of damage and survivability up till end game when you can spec into something you like more. 
---
Probably don’t start with Ele if this is your first go because they are squishy AF.
---
That's what I did too, to get the minstrel instrument. :P
---
Never thought I would be getting sorting tips in GW2 sub. Thanks!
---
"I said nothing to him really. I MAY have said "fuck off" or something of the like." So you said something then, case closed bois.
---
I love this community. I came from BDO, which is so cutthroat that players will kill other people going AFK (And you will be afk every minute you cannot play or you’ll fall even further behind) just to make sure that no one can have better gear than them. It’s common practice that everyone does it. There is not talking or helping in BDO because the final hit is what gives you all the loot and working together splits the rewards (which are needed because you will be grinding for hundreds of hours just to get decent gear and a decently leveled character). I come to GW2 and the first thing someone does is give me 5 gold, some dyes that they apparently don’t need, a costume, and a bunch of buffs. Yeah, I’m here to stay. 
---
I hope your wife gets better. Remember, she’s strong enough to pull through, and things will be back to normal soon enough. If ya need someone to talk to, just send me a message.
---
/u/Dornsinger? It's smackdown time!
---
Dude, I’m one of those newbies that got so happy about 5 gold and some dyes. I came from BDO, a game with a community exactly the opposite of this one.
---
Kinda a follow up. PvP is a **team** endeavor. If you actually do stuff to help get your team to 500 points faster you are being helpful. Everytime you are killed the other team gets 5 points. Not dying is being helpful. Being fast and moving around the map to neutralize other points (not fully cap) is helpful. Moving around to split up the other team is helpful. Fighting on a node but not killing or capturing is helpful since you are stopping the other team from getting points and tying up one of their players too. Specializing and being effective at killing a hated class like Scourge or Mirage is super helpful.
---
... I said "God that's a *really* ugly baby"
---
I have a small pile of those things in a box somewhere! GW skill pins! :) They're quite neat, although I never really found a good use for them. Got them by winning some of the old contests and maybe some other way but I forget now. I think I even had duplicates, though.
---
I'm assuming that they are very afraid of people abusing a system that awards significant amounts of gold in WvW. In PVE they can control timers and difficulty etc, in WvW not as much.
---
Of course, your situation is a huge pile of BS, but thats not the fault of the playerbase or the game, but arenanets policys...
---
Also don't mirror the behaviour of a single asshole onto the whole playerbase -.-
---
If I were you, I'd report the guys back after your ban runs out.
---
I wouldn't report all accounts, only his main one that he used in PvP, and I'd make it clear that he kept on harrassing you with new Alts.
---
I don't know the rules by heart, maybe it's not allowed to use Alts.
---
Mayve you can clear the error of Arenanet up that way as well.
---
...so you're telling me I'm not human?
---
30k+ is annoying. Ughh.
---
The real concern is if someone used RMT gold to buy mats or bought gold directly. Then you can get in trouble. If the stuff isn't bought, then it should be fine.
---
&gt; Yeah so that's how this game works?
---
Actually that's how the *world* works. 
---
Rules are rules, they are the same for everybody. If you insult someone, even "only" with "fuck off", you have to deal with the consequences. 
---
And if someone insult you for ours, but your are totally *fine* with it and allowing him to him to insult by not reporting it, *don't* expect any consequences for that person than. 
---
If you didn't defend cowardly behavior like that, you would have reported him. You actually promote those kind of behavior by not reporting it.
---
This isn't a game suggestion thread. This is a "Get answers from the community" thread.
---
Arenanet does not actively go through this thread for suggestions.
---
So what does elderly mean to you?  30s....
---
I got the flesh wound and vow of silence, still up on my cork board since 2007
---
&gt; Of course, your situation is a huge pile of BS
---
I agree, but for other reasons. 
---
I mean OP make this reddit post and start flaming about that guy and Anet. Accusing both for things he can't even know (faking pictures, not ready [but still answering] mails etc) and telling us, that one guy is insulting him for 4 hours. 
---
Not only that, this guy threatened him and his family with murdering and raping, but OP didn't want to report him, because "he isn't a snitch". 
---
Instead he "may" insulted him back but "nothing ban worthy" and blocked him (after all these insults?). But ofcourse his bans didn't work, because this guy immediately came back with another account and continued his insults. 
---
So the guy made F2P accounts after every block? Not possible, F2P accounts have to be on the same map as the whispered person, so he had to play the tutorial every time first and OP had to stay in PvP lobby for 4 hours. 
---
And even if this guy had multiple accounts, with blocking every 3 minutes (which is pretty much time) he would need 80 accounts to insult him for 4 hours. 
---
Not to mention that all this effort is only to insult some random guy. If you read everything OP wrote properly, it sounds very shady. Not very credible. 
---
Keep in mind that those people, who complain about their ban on reddit, always want to present themselves as the victims and therefore don't tell the whole truth. They want to get consents about their "unfair treatment" and don't want to discuss about what (really) happened.
---
You got a laugh out of me - take my upvote xD I shouldn't laugh with this cold...
---
They farm a lot and can make a legendary in 4 days if they want to, don't k ow how they do it o-o
---
Swapping elements is just like weapon swapping on other classes.  As far as gear, it is not hard to level with completely offensive stats as long as you are dodging and using your skills to mitigate damage(blindness, knockdown, etc.).  It is a different play style than other classes, but *it's not hard*.
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/welcome-back-to-guild-wars-2-week-four/
---
This says the 4th episode is going to be free
---
I heard heal scouge was a "bad way to train" because it teaches raid teams that mechanics don't matter since you have such good res (i.e the class is so hard carry people don't learn) lmao !!
---
Na not from metas they can't, either flipping reasonably well on the TP or swiping a credit card.
---
Also what's your ingame name , could use some advice and would like to bounce some stuff off you. T4 dailies is my goal
---
The "less privileged world" aha, you are funny. 
---
However, there are no "less privileged" people in a game like GW2. Nobody has more privileges than others. And if you give up some of your privileges, it's your own thing and only your own.
---
Well, we got a non-Gemstone Mail-Carrier allready...
---
Next week free All or nothing ?, it's already free since this is the current episode :)
---
Boon duration in fractals is already boosted and HP loss is forgettable.
---
I don’t know why its only 3 marks per week. I wish they’d also put one at end of platinum and mithril tracks, making 5, and also something nice at end of diamond (the mystic coins are nice but feel somewhat insufficient - maybe double the number to 8 so that we get 10 per week when you add the 2 from gold track). It always seems that PvE swims in gear, PvP swims in money, and we just get hvy loot bags with t5 mats.
---
I play on EU, i THINK my account name is Bunz.5789, but just give me yours, because im not entirely sure right now.
---
There are 2 sides of the coin on this topic imo.
---
1st side is that having a heal Scourge to rez in training you makes the experience more worth it, more interesting and more enjoyable because the group has less risk constantly having to reset in the first 30-60 sec of a fight. That means that in the same try you get to experience more mechanics (or more of the same mechanics) while not having to redo the same part of the start of the fight ad lose some time because you have to respawn, walk back to the boss, etc, etc. If you are in the right mindset it will make you learn mechanic in a more fun environment.
---
The other side of the coin is when you're not ready/in the right conditions to learn and you mostly wanna leech. In this case then you might get a kill thanks to the effort of the rest of the group and a heal Scourge but never really learn anything from it. However you wouldn't have learned much in any situation and the heal Scourge might be able to compensate for your lack of involvement so that the overall experience of the rest of the group (assuming the number of leeching people is like 1-2 not 5 :p) is still very enjoyable.
---
So it benefits player that are in the correct mindset, helps to compensate a leeching player and does not change much on what the leecher would get out of the fight so it's a very win-win situation imo.
---
Could easily be a grandpa selling things that ended up in a junk bin from his family.

I thought FB Bunker  is the meta build for guardians?
---
Hi folks, semi-newbie here. Two quick questions:
---
1. I am level 24, and I have 20 tomes of knowledge saved up. When it the best time to use these? Fine now, or should be saved for later, to get to 80 or after 80?
---
2. Today I got a log-in reward of "Chest of Loyalty". It offers a) Ascended crafting materials, b) Legendary crafting materials, c) laurels, or d) tomes of knowledge. Which is the best in the long run? I haven't done much crafting yet, but I had something similar to this awhile ago and some people told me to choose materials.

Thanks for the help.

I think the problem is their rarity. They're like a Nuka Grenade in a Fallout game - so precious you don't end up using it at all.
---
I know this thread is old af, but I'm hoping you're still around to answer a question? What armor pieces did you use for your Guardian? I've never seen those Charr boots, with the steel claws up over the real ones.
---
I need the BL Salvage Kit waaaaaaaay more than the Revive Orb - so that's not a problem from my side.
---
That's why I came up with the point of how many accounts he would need to insult OP for 4 hours. 
---
&gt;And even if this guy had multiple accounts, with blocking every 3 minutes (which is pretty much time) he would need 80 accounts to insult him for 4 hours. 
---
Even if it takes 10 minutes to get blocked and log into another account, this person would still need 24 accounts. 
---
I mean there *are* people with such amount of accounts, but that's only a few and it's very unlikely that this person is one of them.
---
Prior statement still stands. It IS an ugly baby.
---
oh... well.... nevemind
---
Just a game. Play how you want to play it. If it gets a kill you're happy with then alls well that ends well.
---
Anet definetly looks at chat logs. That's why you want to stay calm and just report and block them, as the system is intended to be used. Responding in anger just mean they got what they wanted.

That's good to know! I think I mean more in the sense that I did a majority of my open world progression with the ele and I don't know enough about the game to know what I lose and do not lose by switching to another class.
---
I agree on the loyalty options, though I'd say legendary crafting is the best option IF you are going to use the clovers, otherwise laurels then ascended materials materials. So for a new player laurels 100%.
---
Well since I was crying about it not coming two weeks from now and the fact that people have suggested that my thought process was wrong, by my crappy logic any time after 22-Apr.
---
I would happily convert stack of them to lvl 80 booster
---
Minstrels is expensive and suboptimal. Why would you do this to yourself
---
You can use the boost to try the class at 80 as it is reversible. basically, click once get ported to silver wastes, do stuff, then you can chose to revert or to confirm the boost. Oh, and you'll get full exotic soldiers gear with the boost (or some weird condi stuff on Necro and maybe some other classes). The wiki has probably more info if you want to read more. Just /wiki and shift click on the boost to get directly to the wiki page of it.
---
For me is the opposite, I hate quests system, talk to the npc then go do some stuff and come back to npc and so on, I think is boring. The point is that in GW2 you don't need to do something because you must, but you can do everything you want and for each things you do there's a reward (not always a good reward indeed). Maybe for someone that come from traditional mmorpg is uncomfortable, but for me is like a breath of fresh air. I agree that the achievements pannel navigation system isn't the best if you want to search for specific achievement and a little confusing, maybe an improvement wold be welcome.
---
Already have it for my scrapper
---
Ha I wasn't actually using it, it was my first and is still my favorite legendary, so I put it on in anticipation so I could grab some screenies. I do play firebrand pretty much all the time but rarely with hammer :P
---
Core necro seems to be making a comeback too.
---
Sucks man. It's called guild bombing. Back in GW1 people tried to bomb my guild on a weekly basis.
---
They never did. I was the GL and had only two officers, my the gf and our best friend.

For some reason my Gw2Hook Reloads all the effects whenever I minimize the game.Any fix?
---
♪Spider Siamouth...♫
---
I don't think that's a good way to describe it.
---
The bigger problem is that the feeling of "I don't know what to do" is questionable to begin with, learned behavior from previous MMOs from the WoW era forward. And considering how gaming expanded around that time and how influential WoW was, it's natural that its mechanics become the gold standard and hence what people expect.
---
Now, GW2 is - or was, at release - a MMORPG meant to not do the same thing. Gameplay was supposed to be done **because you enjoy the gameplay in itself**, not because of an extrinsically rewarding quest or achievement added to he process.  
---
As far back as ascended gear, this was already weakened, now a layer of "have something to grind at 80" was added. Which isn't bad in itself, buy the devs caving so quickly goes to show just how pervasive the expectation of external reward structures is.
---
Now, I do thing GW2 could be perfectly fine without. We don't need to make people use their achievement log as a "conpletionist quest log", what the game however needs is better tutorials.
---
Everywhere. For everything. And that includes, importantly, teaching the underlying design idea in a better way. Back before the NGE changes the newbie zones did an amazing job at conveying the game's focus on freeform exploration and gameplay, but they just no longer do. The game however should show players how it is designed. It shouldn't be upon us the community to work around it.
---
Took me a minute
---
Character that &gt;!dies in the new Game of Thrones season premiere!&lt;.
---
Okay I’ll take a stab... probably get 95% close so watch and learn from a former athlete.
---
You: normal guy playing rank PvP (I’m thinking g2-3?)
---
 
---
Him: killed teq &amp; Tt a few times and now thinks he should have legendary PvP badge (plays high silver lol)
---
Match: standard que.. probably a shitty team comp on his side.
---
You guys play and he dies.... dies again.. dies the 3rd and 4th time to you and feels as if you are purposely “targeting” him or like you are farming him over and over with base/spawn camp technique (which honestly can happen to anyone at almost any rate with bad team comp).
---
Fast forward... dude is all up in his feelings since you “targeted” him even as they was losing (so dude thinks it’s personal and send you a PM)
---
PMs turn toxic and the behavior turns from attacks to baiting (a point I’m guessing you missed)
---
By responding at all you open the door and whatever you said.. End result is he baited and reported you so YOU catch the ban!
---
(Why would they ban him no matter what he said or did... you never reported it right?)
---
This happens in sports a lot... bait, tease, pinch, pull shirts, just dgameo everything to make the player foul you so the ref will throw his ass out!
---
(And all the while he’s been standing on your shoes, grabbing jerseys.. just basically cheating and still since you took the bait.. you catch the foul/ban)
---
My advice: Never reply to spvp shiz talk. Also... win with honor and lose with grace and ALWAYS make reports.
---
It’s not “tattle tale” or “snitch” bro get over that shit it’s a game (NOT the streets... different rules apply).. Its actually cleaning up the mess before someone else has to step in it.
---
Or say it like this... someone before you let him slide so that’s why he even attacked you (when with that behavior he should have been on a ban before you even saw him)
---
So if everyone reports the bs... Nobody else has to deal with the shit you allowed to grow (since your to “street cool” to report.. you got baited and got a foul and now.. an actual good guy like you can catch a legit ban when your ass should have got him 1st.. as you said.. hours before and on his main account during, or just after the match)
---
Arming children with guns and sending them to war but not letting them drink legally for 3 more years.

mesmer is awful for leveling

Well not just that, but if you use say a level 40 scroll it is a total PAIN to have to click through EACH fucking level as u go through them....
---
**How can I raid/dung?**
---
Your first dungeon will unlock at lvl 30. With story paths opening on each dung every 10 lvls. You can use the LFG interface (shortcut: Y) to look for people queuing for dungeons. The description will usually imply what path is being run and in what fashion, along with any other reqs. Raids are end-game content. You will *typically* need a fully asc geared char with a meta role to get anywhere with raids. Consistent raiding is very structured, with many guilds recruiting for raiders to take up a particular role on a particular schedule. Be ready to invest heavily in to raids. If you are after a slightly more relaxed/casual approach to instances similar to raids, take a look at fractals of the mists. They are smaller and quicker, and most can be done on exotic gear with PuGs. T4+ fractals will have harsher reqs.
---
**How do I become the healer?**
---
GW2 doesn't really adhere to the *holy trinity* of most other MMOs. Most classes can fulfil most roles, but some are preferred over others. In lower tier content I wouldn't be concerned about picking up a healer/support role. They are only really sought after in high end-game content (T4+ fractals/raids) - and even then most will be off-heal of sorts. Ele has healing capability in its water stance, but is not BIR and groups will not pick it up. Meta healing comes from Druids and sometimes Mirage.
---
**Grinding dungeons is necessary for skins!**
---
Yes and no. Dungeon specific skins can be unlocked with dungeon specific currency. Which will require several playthroughs. Most skins are obtainable through TP or other methods.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hope this helps.
---
So that's why the old man didn't want it anymore.
---
Ignorant people being vocal and toxic while spreading misinformation isn't something you should listen to.
---
He said she said they said, you don't have all the details behind that ban.
---
Though it wouldn't be exactly the same, wouldn't it.
---
50% chance to get glancing hits (50% damage) is a difference than hits do 25/50% less damage.
---
The 50% chance doesn't mean "every 2nd attack will do 50% damage" but rather each attack you have a 50% chance to do only 50% damage so you can do 5 times 100% damage and the next 5 attacks only 50% damage.
---
With your Suggestion the player would always do 25% less damage whenever weakness is applied to them for the whole duration.
---
If you have a "every 2nd attack" type of system then the outcome would be pretty much the same but since we are talking about a chance here you could do more (more hits are at 100% "strength") or less (more hits are at 50% "strength") damage overall than your suggestion.
---
Granted, it would remove the randomness but it also would "cheat" you out of additional damage you might be able to do.
---
I personally like the randomness more because it brings a bit of uncertainty and fluidity into the game because you can't say for certain that this attack will slay the enemy because you might not do the full amount of damage.
---
"Random ascended boxes... Yeah no biggie
---
On average it would be the same yes, just by numbers but "by chance" might not behave as you expect it to. It depends on your data points and how many you have. If you just have 5 and are lucky enough to get 5 hits without glancing then you don't have a 100% ineffectiveness but rather you got 5 times on which the weakness didn't trigger.
---
With your suggestion your would reduce the damage regardless.
---
&gt; because you expected the enemy to be dead
---
I would use the same point as a counter argument towards your point.
---
&gt; You could also say the same about being "cheated" out of additional damage when you do a glancing blow.
---
But you wouldn't because the condition is how it works now. you would change it in a way that players always do the same damage over the duration of weakness while with the original version you could do more or even less damage.
---
While I never faked my LI and instead did my early runs always with the same guild I have to say that I didn't need alot runs to get the bosses. For some they are not hard to understand especially if you play a role that doesn't have to do anything besides dps. The required LI or Kp are in most cases excessive and if you don't hinder your raidteam I see no reason to not fake the LI. You know yourself  if you are capable to do a boss and if so join a group that is capable to kill such boss aswell. However if you want to get carried and fake you LI for it I'd strongly recommend to not do it. You only get kicked and blacklisted.
---
Even people who don't fake LI are trash
---
Thats some magic find u got there...
---
Probably trying to sound smart and/or edgy.
---
when you at it,rework slow/chill/criple.
---
Wow, thanks... that's... that's not what I asked about at all :D
---
 The following contest is scheduled for one fall and is for the Tyria Continental Championchip! Introducing first the challenger from the Nebu Terrace, Kryta, weighting 120 pounds! The master of social skills, the grown up man! u/ubdemark216!! And his opponent from the Mists weighting 119 pounds, the destroyer of wrongfully banned people, the exposer of bullshit! u/Dornsinger!!!!
---
(As far as I know dornsinger is female, let me know if I am wrong)
---
This shows your lack of situational awareness. If this truly is what happened, then you are probably not doing the right thing either of your goal is to win.
---
PvP is about adapting to every match and not doing the same thing every time expecting the same results every time. If you 1v4ing won you many games it doesn't mean it's a good stat every game, because there's too many variables involved in each match.
---
I still have the ones from Nightfall.
---
LI  don’t proof nothing , the community needs to learn that , I saw lots of people who faked LI who is better than the others who didn’t
---
I mean with current system you might as well get 50% reduction on all of your hits, and OP's suggestion would be a buff.
---
At least you get cheaper armor once you reach rank 2000. with all stats available. But tickets do not replenish fast enough that you can think about grinding for one set. Every reward is made for people who had these unused currencies. You don't play WvW to get the armor, you play WvW because you want to and people who played long enough are rewarded with non unique trinkets and almost free T3 armor. By the time you can buy these you already have ascended gear on all of your characters. It's only useful for expensive or rare attribute combinations
---
Who fakes like is just wasting his and everyone else's time since 1 he'll most likely be kicked asap or 2 the team will just disband asap
---
Bet you're fun at parties.
---
they should fake LI if that is the only way they will be able to get into a group. This LI gate is stupid.
---
Honestly the amount of people here saying "Just fake your LI, KP means nothing" is one of the reasons why LFG is such a toxic mess. People who make no effort to respect the rules of the LFG just end up wasting people's time and sanity.
---
If the group is asking for 50 LI, 100 KP, or hell even only female charr mesmers and you don't join meeting those requirements you are the one in the wrong. If you don't like the LFG requirements make your own, that's what I did early on.
---
50% reduction would make it a more powerful condition than it already is: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Weakness
---
Currently, you have a 50% chance to do 50% less damage and 100% less crit damage. My suggestion is a 100% chance to do 25% less damage and 50% less crit damage.
---
Do it as me - never tell anyone your number of LI. It is after all absolutely useless number. 
---
I got *some*. Half a year ago. What is their value now, with me not raided in a while? Would groups accept me if I ping them? Maybe. Would it be useful? Absolutely not, as my actual skill at this point is determined by recent plays, not by halfyear old clears that I barely remember.
---
I either know stuff and join based on that, or not and then don't join. It is that simple. But same goes for those who require it from others. It is pretty useless to see proof that some years ago, that person raided.
---
Legendary Insights, just like Achievement points or certain kill proofs are just a player invented classification of someones skill which no real value behind it.
---
It is just a flawed system overall. I remember people looking for players for Fractals 100CM and Unstable Cosmic Essence, problem is that you could either get 1 or 6 of those "kill proofs" each time you did it. So you could do it 100 times and could get 100 or up to 600. Does this now make you better if you have 100 or 600?!
---
Legendary Insights are the same thing, You could do Escort mission all the time and get 1000 of Legendary Insights (I'm exaggerating here), does this make you a good player? Obviously not.
---
I'm not saying it is ok to fake your Legendary Insights but with the amount of ridiculous statements and Legendary Insight requirements it is really no wonder why people do this.
---
IMO, it is okay to get into a group if you are experienced and know how it works but don't have enough Legendary Insights that people want you to have, but if you don't know anything then obviously don't try to get into a group who expects you to know.
---
Basically, don't try to enter a marathon as a snail.
---
Www.gw2bltc.com
---
I understand that there are some who have done escort/VG for 3 years or something stupid but I doubt those are in majority. Those people probably have quit ages ago too. Or focusing on open world.
---
It's just shame how hard is it to get into raids. Don't blame em, some gw2 players are so casual they peobably play twice a year. And it's their group their rules. But still, :(
---
Better return to wow, you're way to pro for us!
---
But a stack are 250 lvl so you are losing many lvl on that..
---
Still processing, but:  [https://youtu.be/OFu4rvkarZ0](https://youtu.be/OFu4rvkarZ0)
---
I had great success with posting bananas instead of li, no kidding!
---
I saw people advertising LI faker websites in raid lfg.
---
Ty for input!
---
But No thanks. I ain't going back to the gear lottery race. Specially after changes on classes and grind. Still miss my warlock tho.
---
yeah but very few people ask for 300li raids from what i see, normally its like 50 or 100
---
I had great success with posting bananas instead of li, no kidding.
---
Because having requirements is toxic by default?
---
But the point is that it's not the only way to get into a group. There are tons and tons of training runs, guilds, discords, forums, etc. available to everyone literally a single google search away.
---
so any group that doesn't take a player with less than what they asked for is toxic?
---
Anyone who still uses LI as a requirement is a pleb and encourages toxic behavior.
---
Maybe I've LFGd bad times but all I see is 150li min for like "cairn training". 250 for w1 clear. There is no hope getting to w2, 5 or 6 without something silly like 500li or 50 KP.
---
Only way? You can always make your own group lol
---
better off joining a static but 150li for training is something ive never seen lol
---
Seriously. You can grind LI on escort. In the end, why waste so much time policing your pugs? Just put your group together, try, and see what goes wrong.
---
People with actual KP have a significantly lower chance to wipe to those mechanics than random pug that's never done the boss that decides 'I'm good enough to join these people looking for experienced other players'.
---
If you are 100% certain that they have not bought anything of their stuff with gold from gold sellers then sure should be fine. But unless you are not 100% certain then i would not risk it. We seen posts from other players being banned because they thought their best friend would never done so but they did. Or their brother hacked their account and did shit and so on. This things happen, so just be sure this is not one of those cases.
---
&gt; you join not meeting those requirements, you are the one in the wrong
---
In many cases for relatively easy bosses (the ones where 1 person has limited risk to cause party wipes) people joining and telling "you asked for 250 LI but I only have 100 can I come" are welcomed (as long as they do not end up making 50% of the squad :p). And even if they are not well not time was really lost most of the time.
---
you surely learned in wow that raiding in a guild is better than with randoms right  :)
---
If the req is 250LI and you join with 50LI I would kick you myself. Not all groups are toxic because they kick you for low reqs. 
---
In EU in fact, just yesterday this happened to me, I joined a 250LI W2 Run, some people asked if it was okay if they had 150LI (2 people total had only 150LI) and the comm said yes no problem and they joined. The run was almost flawless. Matt was a bit nasty but we got it after the 3rd try.
---
The problem is that this takes a shitton of time. You set no requirements, you get a nomads necro being outdpsed by the chrono. You kick the necro, you now get a new player on a berserker thief that dies to the first mechanic in the fight multiple times in a row. You kick the thief, etc.
---
High LI players have a much lower chance to be not total shit.
---
What have you tried doing that made you think that raids are hard to get into?
---
Kill proof does not translate in performance very well. There's plenty of anecdotal evidence to support either side when it suits them. 
---
For example people new to raids can easily outperform veterans who have gathered over 1000 LI since the launch of raids but only played on and off without ever looking into rotations and strategies for particular fights and there are also those people faking either LI or guild decorations to get picked up by a group which is able to carry them through the fight without much effort. 
---
In the end it doesn't really matter if LI/KP are being faked, you're still playing the lottery when accepting people into your group. This is one of the reasons why I personally stopped looking for that when I decide to use LFG. My LFG will simply read "IQ above Room Temperature". 
---
But hey, if you really insist on Kill Proof being genuine it would be best to advocate the use of user created tools like https://killproof.me/
---
LI means nothing.
---
I would agree that LI should be faked under the condition that they actually know the fights and are good. For example, I started raiding with wing 1, but couldn't play the game much after that due to irl. I just recently came back, and learned wing 2 (in a training raid) last week. I would have no problem joining any group for wing 1 or 2 at this point, they're piss easy once you've done them a couple times and know mechanics. There's no circumstance where you'll find me in a group for wing 3+ that is not a training raid or at minimum knowingly accepting an inexperienced player.
---
The problem is people aren't honest. People think they're good at this game because they play it a lot when in reality they're complete trash. People are so incredibly bad at this game it's astounding, and I'm only referring to people who engage with raid content with that statement.
---
i smell a salty openworld dude who got kicked
---
Idk, i pug alot and 99% of time when someone joins with insufficient kp most pug commanders just kick without saying a word. That is not toxic behaviour.
---
I consider the person joining to be the toxic one, expecting to be carried by a better group.
---
And we get a Fractal based on the war.
---
I agree. But they did, always, have forms of gatekeeping in the game.
---
Happened in dungeons, happened in fractals, happened in raids, happened as arguments against dps meters, happens in wvw, ...
---
So anet ignores the issue completely while it continues to get out of hand increasing toxicity between two ends of the spectrum. What do you call this? Benchmark for competence?
---
[removed]
---
Thought this was /r/hmmm for a second.
---
Average gw2 player doesn't know what's dodge and what's CC so trainings are the only way for such people to get used to such content.
---
3 years ago there were plenty of groups with low LI requirements because maximum cap was 100-150. If all these people who said that raids were hard or who are faking LI would post lfg instead of joining random ones, it would be just as easy as it was back then.
---
I'm not doing trading post flipping nowadays, but just doing PvE dailies, timegated crafting and 2x amalgamated gemstone from VB and AB gets me 8+ gold profit in under half hour (you just need to login to VB and AB at specific times). Plus once a week or so I look at my [material storage](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/materials) and sell stuff that's over 1 gold. Plus sell Charm of Brilliance that drops from green gear with runecrafter's salvage kit. It really builds up quickly if you don't spend it. According to GW2Efficiency I make about 100 gold a week with about 1.5 hours of super-casual play a day.
---
Haha nostalgia.. I love playing gw2 but I truly do miss the old gw1 days (and stuff like this)
---
I've seen players with 10 to 30 Li who faked their way into groups and still played better than the entire group demanding +500 Li, just an observation I made when I lead raids.
---
For EU, Monday LFG tend to be a bit extravagant because it's the weekly resent and that's when many old/experienced raiders do their full clear. so some will put over-the-top reqs This may also happen on Friday night. For the rest there are quite a few trainings everyday: in the past 2 weeks I think I saw training LFG with no reqs for all the bosses/encounters (except maybe River?) while looking at them from time to time during EU prime time.
---
Then again trainings without any vocal communication (except on very easy bosses) is a bit of a loss. Joining a raiding community or a small guild doing/starting raid trainings (if you can come at fixed times every week for the latter) is usually the best course of action imo.
---
but arent wow raids tied to some kind of ilvl of gear? and you can easiely clear old raids with more or less good drops of higher ilvl from newer areas?
---
I'm someone currently stuck at that point. It's not that I don't know what I could do. I even have some things that sound interesting. But there's just so choice that I'm basically paralyzed and can't decide. I legitimately login, then start doing one thing, but remember this other thing i could be doing and then end up doing nothing.
---
was his name Metatail ?
---
But then you get a full level 80 armor set as well (Like the booster). #WorthIt
---
Missed one which is great for attacking. When the gate is broken on QL you can blink up from below the supply hut, bypassing a nasty choke.
---
You're on
---
True, but there's nothing about low LI that says that player is good and I say that as a player who "commanded" 50li groups with 15li.
---
There's still higher chance to get a better player with high li than one with lower.
---
Is toxicity really "increasing" ?
---
What alternative would you then propose that would still take roughly 30-60 sec per player (which would still be a lot) and is easily available for everybody on a generic boss?
---
Europeans mostly don't use ISO (yyyy-mm-dd) either, like OP did, even though that's the most logical and consistent with other measurement units.
---
&gt; We need to have more information that would help us to evaluate other players, not less. 
---
Kills, not KPs ... I have a friend who killed Qadim 7 times, 13 KPs.
---
ur excpectations of an averag gw2 player are wway too high
---
If you are in that situation then making a plan might be a good thing.
---
I had this a few years ago in which I didn't play that much because there was just so much I could do but at some point I just did what I wanted to do at that moment like doing fractals or finishing up my legendary or doing WvW. the rest fell into place after that.
---
&gt; My LFG will simply read "IQ above Room Temperature". 
---
Man, that'd be harsh on EU (Celsius).
---
&gt; Only soft little nerd boys
---
Hey manly man that was raised on the streets, you're playing a videogame just like everyone else here.
---
Everyone wants a group around their skill level. LI is not a measure of skill, it's a measure of participation.
---
Wvw rangers trying to be relevant in blobs.
---
A star to guide us refers to Aurene guiding the people of thyria (and the commander). During the episode a song is played by a wind instrument without any lyrics. Then in the next episode, after the story instance Scion and Champion the Commander enters Thunderhead Peaks and instantly the same song is played, this time with lyrics, sung by the Zephyrites:
---
Aurene aurene
---
Dragon Full of light
---
Guide us through the night
---
Rise up fearless, lead us with your sight
---
Take flight take flight
---
Answering the question who the star is that guides us.
---
Which forms of gatekeeping are you referring to with regards to dungeons or fractals?  
---
And I certainly wouldn't say that not addressing the issue by implementing an official alternative form of something is incompetent. Anet can't help that people are being dicks to each other. Can they try and employ stuff that would reduce the level of toxicity? Sure. Could that create problems elswhere? Absolutely.  
---
Listen. Just because people do use certain aspects of the game for gatekeeping purposes doesn't mean the devs should give them what they want. I wouldn't applaud a road builder for making a crosswalk on a highway just because people regularly cross there. Don't shift all the responsibility for this situation to ArenaNet.
---
Most people don't want to create/lead a group, at all. That's not only a raid issue.
---
Getting full ascended, is the first one I would go for, you can acquire via multiple ways, crafting, buying from fractal/pvp/wvw/living world vendors, fractals random drops, there is a quest following Hot story that rewards an ascended sword/greatsword/scepter/dagger, you choose which one.
---
You also have elite specs weapons collections.
---
This should keep you occupied for a while, especially if you go for different sets.
---
They're not.
---
Shame they can't be converted in Dias ... :)
---
Lol yeah when only 4 specs are allowed to participate in a game mode, I think that's pretty piss poor effort
---
NA pug lfg uses KP not LI. Still full of fakers. Bored and joined a pug kp Xera lfg. Wiped pre three times then proceeded to Xera. No might from double druid setup and the tank being some newbie deciding to stay center when it was obvious that we would fail first DPS check. Rage quit after. Keep faking your LI/KP.
---
It will even out eventually, over the large amount of kills. 
---
But somehow I doubt that people who are arguing against kp as a whole would appreciate a-net exposing them even further with the actual kill count.
---
Not sure what HoF is but fractal builds is
---
https://discretize.eu/
---
It looks awesome ! Reminds me of Protos longbow . Yes its kinda meh when you look on the Chaos skin but till I love it ! Wish I would have a character I could use it on =(
---
Eh, I quit because of more than that. This is just the biggest reason. I really enjoyed the classic trinity system, and I didn't care for how ANet awkwardly tried to implement it later on.
---
Well, that's one way of losing your Charr's horns...
---
"You should just roam if you want to play ranger." A comm chooses who's going to be in his or her party. Other classes ( Like herald ) outperforms soulbeast in both damage and boon output. Firebrand puts out stability more reliably than soulbeast. There is nothing stopping you from following the tag even if you're not in the party

"You should pick another class if you want to play WvW." Atm soulbeast is very strong as a "roaming" class. Noticed I put quotation marks on roaming because even in 1 to 10 vs 1 to 10, soulbeast is very effective.
---
because spam clicking with each level up lighting up your character in an animation spam is glorious
---
30k AP in less than 4k hours? i call shenanigans!
---
seriously though, congrats
---
To be fair, the whole ranger in a zerg thing is a non-issue. The zerg literally can't stop you from running with them. The most they can do is waypoint somewhere and outrun you, but if they're so petty that a build's going to make them fuck over their run, then I say go for it. Facts are that stances can help a zerg, it's just that other classes help MORE and so groups only want them. Block the people who whine at you for following a zerg on a ranger.
---
All that said, I totally sympathize with you. I was kicked from a zerg and mocked in their voice comms as being a "stealth bad scrapper" or some shit \*because I joined a zerg with the wrong food buff\*. Because no one ever logs in with their characters for anything other than WvW and might need... 2 seconds to put up the "right" food buffs (that are almost meaningless in a group of 50 people). I was kicked from a zerg, after spending more than a week running daily with them, because I joined as reaper. I was a reaper because I hate taking camps on my own as a scourge and needed, again, 2 seconds to click the elite spec icon to change to what the group needed.
---
At some point people have to understand that it's not class balance or meta, etc. It's just that the WvW community is a shit community.
---
At least you can pew pew players off their mounts, if they are too far behind the zerg.
---
Well fuck me sideways.
---
All your pings mean absolutely nothing...fake or real.
---
It says absolutely NOTHING about your personal skill, performance level, nor experience.
---
All it says is you managed to grind out some stuff...regardless of if you were carried through it or took 5(+) hours for that VG clear. It means NOTHING!
---
Ranger adds a lot of things, but for example spirits and spotter is worthless in wvw.
---
WEll, if you have doubts, ask them to ping theier own kp right in the squad chat. If you aren't satisfied with the answer - leave and let other people in the gorup draw their own conclusions. 
---
Tbh looking at the sheep in this thread, sometimes it is better to have someone less experienced in the actual fights, but with better organizational/leadership capabilitites to create a group.
---
Usually D20+playtime/1000 days
---
Right, but that's not really a revelation, is it? Has Aurene ever NOT been that? Also, look at basically all the other episode titles and I'm either dumb (likely) or they're all pretty devoid of double meanings. All I'm saying is that it's not this long-standing tradition for ANet to make clever titles. Usually they mean what they mean.
---
This isn't an excuse for the absolutely pathetic state of game wide balance that we have.
---
3 random ascended raid boxes and 3 random ascended fractal boxes. more or less a weeks worth of daily T4 fractals and a raid fullclear.
---
the 4 similar boxes you see are the guaranteed boxes you get once for a raid CM.
---
everything else are basically trash trinkets that are worth the amount of stabilizing matrix you get from salvaging them.
---
"Pharus: the poor man's Chaos Longbow"
---
You could try contacting support about this and see what anet can do
---
:(
---
&gt; yet adds things like li, KP,
---
I don't think that a-net consciously adds these things as  kp. It is 100% player initiative. But even if they'll start to take it all away, players will be resorting to more and more absurd and unrealted means of appraisal (like AP),  while high level organized parts of the game (raids, cm fractals) will be collapsing in chaos. "Gatekeeping" is simply essential in demanding social activity (and also in preventing people who are using this term unironically from entering the society).
---
But plagued by the old stigma of "casual game" (which is indeed supposed to be something that gives you 100% success no matter what you do, apparently, worse than GW2'12-13, a.k.a. "that mmo with no endgame"), a-net are still too afraid to embrace it and provide us with means to structurize our playerbase.
---
Magical bowstring, only touches hand and magical arrow.
---
&gt;Yeah, we can be ~~relevant~~ Revenant our time will come
---
Thats the spirit!
---
I agree the content is easy. But the easier the content the worse the players.
---
You've shown that elitism wont be gone in your later paragraphs. AP, APIs, they'll find a way.
---
Requirements increase because due to leeching and laziness average skill at more reasonable numbers decreases. It also makes the fake li players stand out more. 
---
Whining about how mean or toxic it is wont makenit go away. As long as most players are too bad to do easy content half decently, requirements will stay. Aka forever.
---
I bet I saw *more* people who actually have LI and are better than those who are faking them. Wanna argue with that? 
---
You seem to have a very binar way of thinking if you consider LI to be either 100% way to prove something or completely unrelated thing.
---
Lol wow, you gathered that from me having a problem with a game that is objectively imbalanced. You ever heard that stupid people are the most sure of themselves?
---
with buffed toughness and vitality he should be able to facetank more damage than he could heal with lost healing power, not to mention it's passive defense whil HP requires him to actually use skills :)
---
&gt; Meanwhile they never did half the mechanics.
---
Well, I can confess never having kited Deimos/Qadim, nor tanked ... or even done the towers at escort (besides portal). Not that easy to rotate roles, even withing your static (and not always willing, I despise chrono gameplay).
---
I can however say, as a main canon/shroom/xxx, that the average player seems really afraid of doing mechanics ...
---
I agree anet never meant them as KP. But i do think it's an extremely logical and obvious result. So if they didnt see it coming and also didnt address it later, ... how does this make their case better?
---
Then they ignore the issue without even considering how players will play their content and what different players want.
---
They can ignore the issues and go we didnt mean for KP to be used this way!!!! But if they didnt see it coming then they're still incompetent. What did they expect?
---
Could it be a possibility that he has a bank material tab expansion and that he linked it from there? I have a mat expansion so my max for mats in bank is 500.
---
I hope this is a joke
---
I have a female charr mesmer. Damn I'm good.

Anyway, google "the cycle of SJW inclusivity". It is all the same cards that are played here.
---
And yes, your lfg OFFENDS our LGBTQIC (C is for casual) community!
---
I have SSD internal (windows) and DR load times keep increasing.  
---
As they added features and appearance items, there is more information that the server has to send the client.  Part of load time is server communication, part client CPU running gw2 and then the graphics drawing on the client.
---
Woops! \*youdidn'tseethat\*
---
oh god put it back on this is horrifying
---
Which classes or specs are currently unbeatable? The problem lies with the player base demanding a meta to be adhered to, not with Anet for failing to deliver the impossible task of making every class or spec perfectly balanced. Even if one class is 0.1% better than another then the players will demand the 0.1% better class to be chosen.
---
Class isn't worthless though. It just has no role inside a big squad.
---
AP isn't better. Titles are going to lock pugs incapable of doing cms, especially w5 and w6, out of those raids completely.
---
Yet you think it makes requirements more manageable?
---
If you want requirements more manageable, you make them more accurate. Making them less accurate just makes players exaggerate just to be sure.
---
Careful, I'm martyring myself by speaking truth to this subreddit of bootlickers. If you agree with me you'll get downvoted too.
---
Lol in a game mode where it's big squad v. big squad it seems pretty crucial that a class shouldn't be worthless in a big squad.
---
great skips!
---
Show me a single gvg comp without fb.
---
Or herald.
---
Or scourge.
---
Or spellbreaker.
---
Show me one where people use, I dont know, reaper. Or weaver. Or mirage. Or holosmith. 
---
Wait you cant? Damn.
---
You don't have to play around big squads though.  No one is forcing you to follow commander.
---
you know this is a pretty weird question
---
it's like asking humans if it's still worth breathing
---
it depends
---
most people enjoy breathing, the ones who don't can't be quite asked
---
you like breathing? breathe. You don't enjoy it? Then don't.

You know you can actually spoiler text with &gt; and &lt;

I just had this issue as a returning player.  
---
Support had my stuff resolved in about a week's time.  They were very helpful and willing to work with me.
---
Thanks!
---
Do you want Anet to completely overhaul the core mechanics of a class just to make it good in zergs where everything is about spamming AoE anyway, thereby, pissing off an even larger group of players that do not zerg and enjoy playing ranger as it is right now? It's just not going to happen.
---
Unfortunately you're going to have to decide between wanting to play Ranger or elitist WvW commanders not allowing you in the zerg squad. The problem is not Anet.
---
Man,  I wish I saw this before I did the storm wizard collection...the long way...16 times...
---
Awesome run though!
---
How much money have you spent on the game?
---
Hiya! As I look back at this post, I see that mistakes were made with URL links. The guardian was supposed to be my ranger and vice versa.  You're probably referring to my ranger because the soulbeast merge can be seen for it. 
---
But I'm just gonna give you both armor sets

If I don't want to play in a big squad or follow a commander for massive battles, what's the point of playing WvW? I was so excited to play WvW again after playing OG DAOC. I was so excited to play Ranger, the class I played in Guild Wars Prophecies. But due to the horrendous balancing, an empty slot in a big squad is preferable to having me in it.
---
So I took my business elsewhere.
---
hmm, i'm pretty sure thats not possible
---
A lot of people don't understand that, yes, you should be able to play what you want, but no, I don't gave to play with you. Wanna play direbrand? Sure, thats fine, but you're not getting the squads boons. Commanders also have the freedom to choose how their squad plays.
---
looking fora guild that will let you play reaper? join MR 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf8xJSrZESk
---
reaper squad!
---
It takes me that long to figure out how to get taco set up. lol
---
Great run!
---
Done , are you on EU by the way ?
---
I joined an experienced Deimos run a while ago where the commander clearly had never killed Deimos and knew nothing about the fight. Needless to say, that group was not going to get the kill and I left after a few pulls.
---
Definitely seen this before.
---
Leader of the Pack should honestly be buffed for WvW at least. I just feel like it doesn't last long enough to really be relevant. Duration for AoE should be at least 100% imo.
---
It shouls have been a different shape, like that sort of web like design (not to sound weeby) they used in Bleach.
---
There are people who have 250 LI and don't what is happening during the fight. Don't judge players by their LI.
---
Well yes you're supposed to ask for KP
---
Deimos ranged 300 LI.
---
you may not have a place in a squad as ranger, that doesn't mean you can't run with them. there is a lot of confusion nowadays about this, but essentially the common wvw "meta" squad classes harmonize very well, the key word is boon priority. now obviously rangers aren't optimal, but they are very viable even for squad based play, however they are very self-sufficient in providing everything they need, and have little to nothing relevant to share. as such, to not mess with the boon distribution order, it is better for them to run alongside the squad.
---
The EBG Midgett-pasta bot is going to be extra delicious tonight!
---
It does look good.
---
Congratulations! I got my 30k AP last week, feels good to finally be there! :D  
---
And now it slows to a crawl, considering I've capped my daily limit. According to gw2efficiency, there's a little over 7k AP available to me, with almost 4k in PvP. Which means I can forget my dream of that gorgeous Radiant back piece because I haaate PvP. Oh well. There's still plenty of fun achievements to look forward to!
---
I'd love to share what different communities have came up with together, but I don't think the tone of this comment chain is the best place to talk about it. Especially since any of those words you used were meant to be positive.
---
&gt; #WorthIt
---
Yeah, soldier's, totally worth it /s
---
Depending on playtime, less than you probably think
---
I'm not sitting here saying titles are better. You are. Meanwhile only one boss in the game has a normal title, all other titles would be more inaccessible for pugs. So you want new easy titles and expect players to ask for those rather than cm ones. I expect plenty will ask for cm titles.
---
Oh I've already contacted them several times. The last reply was that since the guild has been left it is unrecoverable. They refused to help both when it still existed and have no avenue of recovering it now that we re-acquired the name 😒
---
As a Ranger player I agree. I feel like the potential for WvW zerg-play is there for SB but anet wants to be stingy with the balance. If that aoe on the stance trait was buffed a good bit at least for WvW only I know that alone would be enough.
---
What's the point of playing a class? Because I like playing the class. Why should I be punished for playing a class that I like? Lol dude you're flipping this literally every way you can imagine. The game isn't balanced, and it's so poorly balanced that classes are useless in game modes. You're agreeing with me, but using your agreement as evidence that I'm wrong. Are you trolling me?
---
Yeah they deleted it (or got a name change but I don't know if that would allow for the guild name to be available). I have the VotM shell now on my main account (see above edit screenshots). Not sure what to do with it now though....
---
Wow: on normal modes it's very easy to clear some bosses under 10 people. 
---
As is "cheesing" bosses in Gw2 (no green tactic, just burn it, ignoring mechanics, delay cc and heal thro)
---
Power creep happens in both, but obviously higher gear makes wows "older" same expansion raids easier due that.
---
Since they introduced gear rng on top of rng ("forging" your gear for better ilvl and extra stat) you can get very very high levels of gear thro "dailies" and dungeons. You could get highest level of gear possible thro sheer luck from some low tier dungeon run ("mythic+" which is kinda like fractal tiers cept it goes to +10 and above) and you could potentially be set for rest of expansion even if you killed hardest boss in game or they raised ilvl significantly.
---
So that makes it possible for someone to have amazing gear without too much of effort and get into pugs. And since higher gear means better dps, it's not even that bad unless the player is totally clueless on rotations
---
Try reading first before commenting, you'll go far in life that way
---
Don't you guys have lvl 60 scrolls?
---
Didn't knew you could clip and skip the start like that, that's some nice skipping done there. Good job.
---
guess i was wrong then. not that i think of it, i think i just tried using a scroll _before_ entering the tutorial instance.
---
Same here, I wish i knew about the cloud path shortcut before doing the stupid fish tower 16 times...
---
Now we just need a 5 minute path that skips the long way around for 2-3 too.
---
What tier? Is it a group mostly consisting of a guild? Is it a pug commander? What was the group's objective? Because in T1 and T2 my ranger and my ranger only friend both never have problems joining pug commanders and some of the friendlier guilds running. Either you're letting the few instances where this has happened to you affect you the most mentally regarding the subject or you've had a very unlucky streak. If you're trying to join a Commander who's only running a meta-slave group then of course you won't get in, but those are rare and not the norm.
---
Don't let the few instances where that happens seem like it's what happens every time, from my experience it's very rarely that I ever get kicked or denied access to a group running on my Ranger. The few times it happens is from shitty guilds who think they're good so they only run meta groups, or pug commanders who don't know how to fight with what they have.
---
Since someone will say it, i'll get it over with. They have a lot of disposable income so they can do what they want with it, you're just jealous that you don't have one, it's perfectly normal to be able to grind over 10 legendaries, people who buy these are the reason the game's still going (yeah someone has actually said this), it's not negatively impacting you, grinding gold is too hard in this game so using real money is fine, people I personally know/myself have bought legendaries so it's fine.
---
Those are probably all of the excuses i've heard people say, referencing real posts.
---
Those are two different things. Getting into a training discord and practicing the fight until you get the mechanics and kill it is one thing.
---
Having to slog through months of not being able to find regular groups even after you have finished your training quite another.
---
If i didn't have a guild to get the first hundred i probably would have quit during that time as well.
---
I think they should go the other way.
---
Have all the randomness in the Weapon Strength property in weapons. Maybe even increase the ranges a bit, but keep all randomness in that one weapon property and combat interactions, then remove all random chances from anywhere else, and change precision into a new attribute that does something else. Like:
---
* "Agility", increases attack speed.
---
 * Quickness would be changed to work like Might, giving Agility attribute instead giving speed directly.
---
 * Fury would also be changed to work more like blind and aegis, dealing one guaranteed critical and ending on crit.
---
* "Wisdom", increases effects of boons and other 'indirect' combat effects that cause damage indirectly or add damage on player's skills, changing the main 'damage increase' attributes from 2 to 3: Power, Condition damage and Wisdom.
---
 * Boons that can indirectly cause more damage would scale with Wisdom: 
---
     * Might will give more power and condition damage the higher Wisdom is, base might would be reduced from +30 damage/condi per stack to 25, and scale up to 50. 
---
     * Fury would also be changed to give a guaranteed critical on the next hit and end, the final damage caused after ferocity calculations would be improved by Wisdom.
---
     * Retaliation would scale with Wisdom instead Power. 
---
     * Quickness base speed would be reduced to 33% with 1000 Wisdom, and scale up to 66% with Wisdom.
---
 * Support damage boosts that affect allies giving them power or damage like warrior Strength banners and glyph of empowerment would also scale with Wisdom, but not passive effects like traits and sigils.
---
 * Summoned creature/object damage will scale with Wisdom too. That'll go for both summons that do not scale their own power with the player's power like minions, and summons that do like phantasms and turrets. 
---
 * Life steal will no longer scale with power and healing power individually, scaling both effects with Wisdom. All forms of life steal will consistently scale with Wisdom regardless of source.
---
And Taco, tekkit, markers and dodge macros...but we dont talk about those.
---
If rangers weren't complete garbage I wouldn't kick them... 
---
I'd much rather have a game with more variety and effective strategies. I'm just not willing to feed the delusions of snowflakes that think their comps and alternatives are effective.
---
I dont hate ranger for it being ranger, the class just gets bad stigma because those that demand on playing it in groups either dont care about performance or cant evaluate their performance, or both. Hence nobody takes them seriously.
---
Unpopular Oppinion:
---
The bigger problem are the people demanding excessive amounts of kp for what is essential easy mode once reached a certain amount.
---
I want to slap those plebs demanding 250kp for CMs in the fucking face. Those are the one destroying the game because more and more people can't find a group not because they are bad but they have 50 to 100kp. Not to mention that the droprate of fucking kp in CMs is 1-3 RNG you fucking donkeys. You can have 250kp faster if have you more luck than someone that gets 1kp every run
---
Just thinking about seeing this shit in the LFG drives me mad. I am sorry. But this is why I went casual mode in this game. It's the LFG.
---
On his other foot.
---
I really doubt they'll give all the stuff a level 80 boost gives just for 170 more tomes.
---
It literally doesn't matter when half of a 250+ li squad dies to sloth's slams and shakes. Fake all you want, if you don't know the mechanics you get kicked anyway
---
This one is a valid point. Anything above 30-50kp is unnecessary IN MY OPINION.
---
Okay, what do I judge them by?
---
Lesbian, gay, bi, trans, queer, (incest?)
---
Try joining squads on your core ranger. Any self respecting group that isn't ktraining will boot you out.
---
Success is relative. In my experience most players arent what I'd consider successful playing meta, much less on their personal builds. 
---
Of course if successful means tagging downstates in won fights, everything is viable even if not useful.
---
But's it's the players' fault for playing the poorly balanced class, offering nothing to a larger group, and yet demanding to be included; but refusing to conform for said group they wish to join, and calling said group toxic for not letting said players play as THEY choose. 
---
\#rangersaretoxic
---
Deimos and Qadim with their unique mechanics are problematic in their own right because the stupid kiting sections remove players from the main portions of the encounter. They are bad design elements but well considered raid encounters have been lacking recently with fights that force condi or power instead of accommodating both. 
---
I've got about 90 Qadim KP. I've DPSed the fight once, played Chronomancer on it twice and healed it as a Druid once. I've still  never done the lamp because in previous statics I was to solo kite and in any pugs I join, the group usually needs two healers on the stack so I end up solo kiting even if I joined as dps. I didn't see the demon realm of Deimos during the main encounter for about 6 months after release because I actually bothered to gear a hand kiter...
---
good job missing the point
---
1.Yes
---
2. You can wait till 80
---
3. Very casual, even more so than release
---
4. Crafting is pretty simple, just smashing the materials together, mostly automated.
---
5. Dual pistol thief is fine for open world PvE, just spam 3 (unload). 
---
Either of these work if you get the expansions - http://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Deadeye_-_P/P_Unload
---
http://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Daredevil_-_P/P_Dash
---
A guy in my guild was bragging about how he faked quadim KP to get into a raid. Two of the people in the conversation were leaders who are into the elitist raiding scene. Despite them taking screenshots, he blatantly lied about the whole event to an officer when confronted about it. It didn't affect me and I wasnt there for the conversation, but they guy was apparently asked to leave/kicked
---
Ok thanks! Didn't know how to do it
---
You may not necessarily be wrong, I've only tried it in the human tutorial.
---
Exactly, that's why there is nothing wrong with giving them away.
---
In my experience... LI generally doesn't matter, and is a stupid metric to base anything off of.
---
There are players with a high amount of LI, but are genuinely hot garbage. I rarely find issues, because I don't -ask- people to show me their LI. I just ask them a few questions about the encounter. If they get some wrong, I politely correct it.
---
1. Correct.
---
2. You can wait until you reach lv 80 unless you want mount to help you travel faster. Expansions are mostly end game content.
---
3. Game is pretty casual, open world is quite easy for the most part. Some groups will have higher requirements, but you're always free to create your own with your rules (or join ones with same mindset).
---
4. I dont remember it ever being hardcore. Time gating has nothing to do with crafting being hard to do. I dont think that crafting system has changed at all.
---
5. Metabattle has open world section with various fun builds. Engi p/p isnt viable outside of very hardcore pve build (which isnt particularly great even there, especially when not played perfectly). P/p thief is mostly a meme build that works great in open world or some niche pvp/wvw situations (killing squishy targets easily).
---
But again, open world and solo play = play whatever you want. No one expects anything from you except some CC on a bigger boss when the breakbar is up (find it on gw2 wiki).
---
Are you saying we can use ranger spirits in WvW!?
---
If you follow BlishHUD development you will soon have the opportunity to test out one of my two modules I am currently creating. 
---
One is called "Musician" and you will be able to play songs like a rhythm game.
---
Wait, how the hell is following a zerg griefing?
---
mainly google.
---
Islam. 
---
"Intersex", actually, but I had to google it. And also found out that I'm horribly outdated, should have used "LGBTTQQIAAP"
---
You have to do them without spaces
---
Hello
---
Is there a pvp area? How do i fight other players?
---
There isn't really other ones, but with the new skips of you just run a deathless full run you will break it fairly easily
---
I'm sorry, did you say 12 legendaries? I've been playing on and off since beta and I've never even considered having the time for a legendary.
---
BuT ItS AlL wE hAvE!
---
What a cool skips, I have to include then to my tribulation route:-)
---
i meant its weird because i was sure i couldnt use it on my asura.
---
though after reading your edit i remembered that the asuran tutorial includes a 2nd instance, maybe thats the reason.
---
It's really not that weird. I'd say it's a fair question, especially as I'm asking about the Core game and not the expansions and coming from a time when the game was fresh and flowing with people at launch to a free to play fanbase at level 1.
---
Last time I tried the game out, 3 years ago, the maps were barren, I've never been in a guild and not sure how the guild base is still.
---
Yeah that's what I figured. Just incorporating some of the newer skips with mistakes I beat my last year's PB easily. It's just a matter of everything lining up, which I've had super bad luck with this year @_@ If only SAB wasn't seasonal!
---
Do you have an upload of your full run anywhere? I must study it and discover your secrets!
---
One and only!
---
If you enjoy killing your squad with lb2 into a reflect bubble then go for it.
---
I did test on asura master race.
---
My mom of 54 stays up until 1 to 2 am every night playing video games
---
Probably not which is why it's dumb someone said that, hence the parenthesis.
---
I'm probably going to try to run another full run today or tomorrow since I had 1 death at w2z3 costing me 40 seconds and upload that one instead
---
1. The Game is not pay to win but you can pay for Quality of Life. And Pay for shiny stuff.
---
2. You will miss abolutly nothing if you wait till lv 80. In fact you cant even jump into the DLCs befor you hit max lv.
---
3. The game is now more complex than it was before. But this is only normal because since launch there happend a lot of stuff, like two DLCs. There are for example more Stat combinations for armor and weapons. But on the other hand there are now a lot of sources for Builds. If you only intend to do some open World content you dont have to worry about things like perfect builds at all. And if you want to jump into endgame somewhere in the future there a lot of sites that provide rly good builds. So if you dont want to you dont have to create your own build, you can just use builds from sites like [metabattle.com](https://metabattle.com) (many builds for all gametypes and also casual builds for open world stuff.) Or [snowcrows.com](https://snowcros.com) (Endgame Builds) and [lucky-noobs.com](https://lucky-noobs.com) (endgame builds but in german) 
---
4. Crafting is in a somewhat bad place atm. From 0-400 its rly cheap these days and can be done in like 20 minutes (you will find many guids for that, i use this one: [http://gw2crafts.net/de/](http://gw2crafts.net/de/)) But also everything that you can make from 0-400 can also be bought for gold. The good stuff can be crafted if you hit crafting lv 500. Its also easy with guids, but a bit more expensive (30-60 gold for lv 400-500). With lv 500 you now can make Ascendet stuff. Thats the best gear in the game, it has the same stats than legendary stuff. Your first armor and Weapons you will have to craft. But after you get one gearset for your char you can jump into endgame and from there on you will start to drop Ascendet stuff. So in total: you have to hit lv 500 once in crafting for one armor and weapons and from there on you will start to drop the good stuff and you wont have to worry about crafting anymore. (ascendet gear can not be bought for gold)
---
5. This one is kinda tricky. It depends on what you wanna do with the build. Only do Open World, or maybe endgame stuff ? 
---
Engi: You can play engi with double pistols as a Condi Build (damage over time). Or as a power Build with rifle. Only the Condi build is viable in endgame tho. With PoF you will unlock the Holosmith for Engi. From there on you should switch to this Class. You cann still play Condi Holo with double pistols. And Power Holo with Rifle. Both are viable in Endgame. The Builds can be found on the sites i mentioned before.
---
Thief: Thief can be played as power class with double pistols. It is not viable in Endgame, tho. With PoF you will unlock the Deadeye and now you can play rifle power thief. This class is viable in endgame but it is rly hard to play and i would not recommand it for a new player. 
---
I would recommand the Engi. You can play pistol/pistol or rifel from start and with Holosmith you can upgrade both the builds and still stick to you weapons. The Power build is easier to learn and easier to gear. But it only gets rly good after unlocking the Holosmith. 
---
But if you 100% only wanna do some Casual stuff you can basically play what you want and dont worry about stuff. Everything is good enough for open world stuff.
---
If you have more questions or if you did not understand something feel free to pm me :)
---
So there isn't normal pvp are, just matchmaking?
---
I see you don't play gvg and have to rely on awful comparisons to try to make a point.
---
Starcraft 1v1 is just that. At least at a competitive level, many champions will never see play, barring major changes to their kits, because they provide nothing to the comp that can't be easily exploited by competent players.
---
If you honestly think that every elite spec can be equally balanced in wvw, gvg, pve, and spvp, idk what to even tell you. Most classes excel at least somewhere. DH excels in pve but is seldom seen in wvw, for good reason. Should it be reworked around wvw despite already being good elsewhere?
---
I'll be waiting for it then! I'm wondering if you know more skips I have no clue about, there's been a lot of recent discoveries that have been crazy.
---
Again, good stuff on your run! :D I gotta catch up, you have a crazy lead in time on me.
---
It appears when you fire. No need to waste magical energy making an arrow before firing it, like that crappy bow Hank the Ranger has.
---
Performance rewards would make the game unplayable / not enjoyable.
---
If you are interested in this collection of GW1 pins, Wooden Potatoes has a video where he shows and comments the complete collection:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-\_NabRyctdo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_NabRyctdo)
---
That Meteor Shower pin would be amazing to have! Bringing back some ele feels.
---
I adore Pharus. I waited so long for the second longbow legendary, and it was worth the wait. The fading on the edge of the bow and the projectiles looks so good. Absolutely worth its legendary status.
---
That Pharus doesn't appeal to so many doesn't bother me. It's a good thing that many people instead prefer Kudzu. Not every new legendary should usurp previous ones. This one fits for some players, Kudzu for others, thus meaning more variety for what legendaries you see out in the world.
---
That's one big reason why I have no interest in the current greatsword legendaries. Everyone and their mother has them and they have lost much of their appeal to me. I still like them, but I'm hoping Episode 6 gives us a new unique design that I'll fall in love with.
---
now do [Desert Crafting Material Coffers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Desert_Crafting_Material_Coffer)!
---
I hate these so much
---
I'm loving the hate here... Because the title is a direct quote from our servers "favourite" rangar advocate.
---
I play Weaver pretty much exclusively btw.
---
ever played another mmo?
---
ff14: i play ninja but i want to tank! this game sucks! its not allowing me to q as healer when im ninja. whyyy! every class should be viable! i pay my sub! 
---
wow : i main warrior but the game really sucks cause warriors are not getting groups when i say im a heal warrior!
---
Dungeon Master why does Hank have such a crapp.....Dungeon Master?  He's gone again!
---
The projectile for DH LB3 looks like a normal arrow with Pharus
---
Which I guess is nice for pvp but it just looks so bland
---
so whats the point of this post if it isnt even your opinion?
---
I honestly don't understand this "don't report" mentality. If you're getting persistently harassed, you don't just assume it'll stop. If they jump through hoops to harass you, they're obviously not going to stop without an authority's intervention.
---
Would these people tell their children not to tell a teacher when a strange man in a van is trying to give them a ride home from school? Would these people not go to HR if an employee kept making vague sexual passes at them in the workplace that made them feel unsafe?
---
I hope these "don't snitch!!" types can pull their heads out of their butts for five seconds in these situations at least, but it seems like the elementary school "heinous crime" of telling on your bully carried with them into adulthood.
---
Yep, I remember going over to my MawMaw's house as a kid and watching her play Diablo.
---
Agreed! There's a lot of kindness and empathy in the GW2 community. Much more than a lot of online games I've played.
---
ill try it myself ;)
---
Pssh, the Sleeping Dragon was scared of Xiahou Mao!  He ran and hid, unable to do anything until he bribed Jiang Wei to defect. ;)
---
It may sound boring, but consistency is important - especially in competitive settings like PvP and WvW. I would prefer Weakness being boring over it not working on an enemy's burst but mitigating something like auto attacks instead.
---
You da real loosetard!
---
gw2 literally has 27 classes. other mmos only have half of that, some even less than half.
---
Imagine this guy thinking that the person who has been deliberately excluded from getting stealth with the zerg is at fault when the zerg doesn't stealth them.
---
So THAT'S who's been owning my ass on Mahjong Battle Royale at 1:36 am.
---
Real talk, the people who think it looks like the chaos longbow are blind. It looks nothing like the chaos bow at all.
---
It's almost as if raids were a dumb gimmick to sell one expansion whose energy could have been used to make dungeons of a similar caliber of content and difficulty.
---
[Fury](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fury) isn't really random, as it always gives you 20% crit chance. You could argue that crit chance itself is random, but you can counteract that randomness with certain traits, gear with precision extra precision and fury itself to possibly reach 100% crit chance. With weakness, there's no way (afaik) to make it less random.
---
Thanks
---
&gt;So, by "gatekeeping" (whatever this SJW shit is) you mean "not letting them leech from good players"?
---
And the award for unwarranted politicization goes to...
---
:D ye they aren't that nice to do. Eventually you get used to them but at the beginning it takes ages to pull even one off
---
I think the fact that Ranger hasn't been good for zergs since probably launch contributes to the stigma. We had something promising with Druid but it was stamped out and now it has worse healing potential than afking Tempests. It has no range AoE capabilities and any single target damage it does needs to be under Unblockable for it to even land in a zerg. Its boon support for the most part involves killable and immobile Spirits, of which Anet nerfed in last patch anyway. Not even talking about how until Soulbeast, Ranger's whole class mechanic was (still is) basically void in a zerg setting. 
---
How is it that devs allow the 'role' of the Ranger in WvW zerging to be limited to ganking people away from the bubble I can't understand.
---
The what now?
---
There's a limit to how many people can receive stealth from fields/blasts. If your group runs 15 and drops 3 fields, pugs won't get stealth. Closed raids have been a thing since 2012.
---
I dont know if this relates to you. Some anecdotes as I kick plenty of players from squad.
---
Ask people to go discord repeatedly. Doesn't seem to work out. Ask a simple command on discord and kick those that dont do it... immediate angry whispers or chat. 
---
Ask players to swap specs. Ignored for days. Kick the specs you ask to swap. Immediate angry why u kick me response.
---
Ask players to form parties and move themselves out of party 1? Same stuff.
---
Write basic intros in squad message? Still not happening. Kick them for not being able to read and follow basic instructions? Reeeeeeeeee 
---
Regularly inform players rangers will be kicked through teamchat? You guessed it. How dare you kick players reeeeee toxic. Followed by "omg there is queue on this map, where is commander?" 
---
Even funnier with guild raids. Theres 20 guys from one guild and they dont accept the squad invite from a pug that sees them as only tag. Pug cant figure out why he isn't accepted...
---
Because it does not shoot lightning unicorns with wings
---
The ignorance is real. Pathetic.
---
When you said you did the fractal 3 times I thought you were making fun of the other guy who also thought blue orbs didn't heal you.
---
i can tell you exactly why people hate it. the time and mats that go into making a gen-2 legendary are not worth an upgraded chaos bow in their opinion.
---
Not convincing enough - needs more bearbow &amp; babyraging in /t chat.
---
When's the last time you replaced the d3d9.dll?
---
Because bad players would get nothing?
---
If I remember correctly this was pair with divine boon and a mesmer elite enchantment that awarded energy upon ending. Boon monks were a big part of meta in the gg scene for a LONG. Popularized by its use over in Korea by The Last Pride and War Machine.
---
I know they don't pay for gold, but they play a lot, as in all day. Idk how you van subject yourself to so much grind.
---
I don't give _smackdowns_, nor do I 'own' people with my posts. 
---
I simply give information so that the average reader does not feel like they have to be scared of the GM team.
---
Excuse me, I weigh a LOT more than that - I am a Norn.
---
How would you implement an Performance Reward? Top Dps in raid gets more gold? Dying makes you get no rewards?
---
I've seen at least 3 groups where pinging bananas was the requirement.
---
They aren't telling you which class to play. They are telling you that if you don't play optimal classes you won't be accepted in their squad.
---
Create your own squad with rangers and thieves and show them how it's done, yeah? See how it that goes.
---
&gt; How is going "they literally cant stop you from running with them" not griefing?
---
Because you cannot negatively affect them in any way. I can kinda understand the logic of kicking you from their group because they don't want to share their boons with you, but if you're literally just standing next to them and sharing your stances with some people nearby, you are only a benefit to the zerg and not a detriment in any way. If they get mad at you for being there, that's not because you're griefing them, it's because they're illogical whiny elitists who are angry that, at worst, someone is *helping them less than they would like them to be helping*. 
---
That's insane. You can't police who chooses to play next to you in WvW. If I ran a useless sentinel warrior build whose sole purpose was to selfishly survive and contribute nothing, I **still** wouldn't be "griefing" you by standing next to your zerg. Your rights in WvW concerning who you play with begins and ends with being able to kick them from your squad. Everything after that is you being the demanding asshole. (This does not extend to the forms of griefing that are actually possible in WvW, namely spying for other servers, draining keeps of supply on useless siege, and stuff like that; I'm talking about people honestly playing for their server, even if they're playing poorly).
---
It's great as a weapon skin, but not a legendary
---
We don't accept pictures or video as sole evidence, no. Actions must be taken based on our logs and / or in-game observations. We might use a picture to check "does this reflect our logs", but we don't go: 'Oh, JimmyJones sent a picture in which TimmyTomes said a bad word, hey GM Ex Nihilo, ban that guy.'
---
If any GM on the team skips the part of checking the logs, and I check their work and find no records being reviewed, that's the time they get in serious trouble with me.
---
Lol a class playing a specific role it's not designed for a class accepted being played at all is the same thing. Stopped reading there.
---
i still don't get it, what will such a huge overhaul achieve?
---
you already have flexibility within the confines of kits..as i said it would either make it a spam-best-dps-skill or autoattack-only because the energy is depleted for utility
---
you're suggesting a massive rework but for what? engi is in a decent places in all game modes with quite a lot of build flexibility
---
i mean at this point why not suggest something like customizable kits..as the main drawback is the limit imposed by having only 3 utility skill slots which are filled by said kits
---
also this seems for pve only as in pvp/wvw people often run stuff like elixirs(which are removed completely in your design?)
---
it's just a bad idea overall
---
I love you man &lt;3
---
Try on reading the "its not working" part from the [Main page](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/).

TL;DR: Download this two files and install them.

---
Usually this solves the main startup problem, those files are installed by default while "installing some kind of games", but doesn't come natively with Windows, so must be installed manually sometimes.
---
If people are intentionally harassing you, report them. That's what the button is for.
---
&gt;Because no one ever logs in with their characters for anything other than WvW and might need... 2 seconds to put up the "right" food buffs (that are almost meaningless in a group of 50 people)
---
This attitude is awful 
---
You also have to understand WvW has limited population cap for every server on every map so yes everyone on weak classes even if theyre not in squad are hurting chances of winning fights/taking objectives
---
Yes class meta sucks, and WvW community can suck, but it goes both ways with people lugging around their staunch victim complexes making huge fusses about everything the zerg does

New in the Gem store! Hazmat Suit Outfit! 700 gems (and 250+ LI)

---
Ritualist package next week I guess!
---
and [lockbreaker kit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Lockbreaker_Kit), too
---
I agree with you. I have had plenty of people who don't meet the requirements of my LFG but join and ping what they have and politely ask if it's okay for them to join. It's easy to carry 1 or 2 inexperienced players so I generally don't give a fuck and let them join.
---
The chat code fakers get a decent amount of hate and attention but the bros that are transparent and honest are rarely mentioned and quickly forgotten about which contributes to some sort of confirmation bias towards toxicity in raids.
---
&gt; The Maguuma Pact Operation Portal Device gives you information on approaching, imminent, and active threats, and it can teleport you directly to the field of battle. You’ll also have the option to enable world boss notifications in chat, which will keep you updated without needing to check your device. 
---
Does that mean that the Maguuma Pact portal device includes the world boss one ?
---
And for this I love the GM team. All of my interactions with support have been fantastic. I don't always get the answer I want, but I get the right answers. &lt;3
---
We're going to need a batman-esque toolbelt for all these portal devices pretty soon.
---
Imagine people wanting to play with their own groups in their own ways. Wild concept.
---
Can you do the same with Scourge's sand portal? For science...
---
I believe precision is a bit different. You have certain utility skills that cause your next few attacks to 100% crit, so you can only build power and ferocity. 80-90% precision is consistent enough IMO. It sure is possible to engage in combat and not get any crit out, but at the same time how would you do it? Precision determines how many hits will crit when you engage combat? That would totally kill the stat in pve. 
---
Also, currently if you want the precision you gotta go all in, which makes sense because you will be doing a lot of damage. If all of a sudden you can get easily guaranteed crits without going all in I don't see that as a good idea.. 
---
Ultimately, precision is another issue entirely, an issue I would not classifiy as an actual issue .. and you can't just remove the rng of it without completely changing pve.
---
Bah, shared inventory slots. Obviously you gotta use the [free Golem Banker](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Golem_Banker_(consumable)) that's sent to new characters!
---
Content booiisss
---
Does that mean the Maguuma Pact portal device includes the World boss one ?
---
It's called shared inventory slots
---
Butcapes!
---
Yes I did, I also unblocked the d9d3.dll in its properties
---
Ich
---
&gt;!Okay now this is epic!&lt;
---
I confirm soulbeasts are pretty solid in both fractals and raids, no worries.
---
while it's wrong from an ethical/moral standpoint sometimes it's a necessary evil just like the LI/KP system itself
---
while i never faked them cuz i think it's lame i know plenty of people that are simply fast learners and pretty much knew everything there is to know after like 2-3 kills..and those people that progress faster usually resort to faking them without any issues
---
hell, i even know people that faked their way through their first kills without any issue..especially on easier bosses
---
yea it's shitty, but the alternative is wiping for hours in training groups that might not be as motivated towards improvement as the aforementioned players..when i wanted to practice druid i joined some trainings and boy, the horrors!
---
i wish we had better API implementation so there would be no faking, perhaps this way the ridiculous 100kp+ requirements would die out..bonus points for shafting those 20LI commanders that demand 500LI+100kp(yes they exist, yes they're obvious trap runs)
---
it's also pretty hilarious how nobody ever questions the commander and you can easily invite a bunch of your clueless friends before posting the lfg and nobody bats an eye..it truly is a flawed system
---
Light.
---
Because you have a better view on dem tidies, especially the cleavage and sideboobiez.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
anything that isn't medium tbh
---
&gt; Because you cannot negatively affect them in any way.
---
You can lol. 
---
&gt;If they get mad at you for being there, that's not because you're griefing them, it's because they're illogical whiny elitists who are angry that, at worst, someone is *helping them less than they would like them to be helping*. 
---
No, you literally can be damaging by being there. Just becauase it doesn't fit your narative doesn't mean you can't negatively affect them in any way. This isn't open world PvE. 
---
You can rallybot. You can and will reveal stealth. Is this not a negative effect? 
---
You can arbitrarily increase numbers (which leads to issues for groups that prefer even fights). 
---
&gt; That's insane. You can't police who chooses to play next to you in WvW.
---
I get you say a guild can't show up and tell you not to defend the tower because they want to fight on their own. But if you're stalking the group no matter where they go, don't be suprised if the group doesn't like you and don't pretend they're the evil ones. You're literally stalking them wherever they go. 
---
&gt;If I ran a useless sentinel warrior build whose sole purpose was to selfishly survive and contribute nothing, I **still** wouldn't be "griefing" you by standing next to your zerg. 
---
Funny that's what a long-term griefer does to GvGs. Goes full tank warrior and adds to every fight. Sure is the friendliest way to interact with your allies, by ensuring they can never play how THEY enjoy because you don't feel like allowing them to enjoy the game they like. 
---
&gt;Everything after that is you being the demanding asshole. (This does not extend to the forms of griefing that are actually possible in WvW, namely spying for other servers, draining keeps of supply on useless siege, and stuff like that; I'm talking about people honestly playing for their server, even if they're playing poorly). 
---
The most succesful community servers had plenty of closed-raid guilds and groups and the servers pugs respected them; because their players and leads did a LOT for these servers. The servers that didn't respect their guilds ended up losing them, and typically didn't exactly get a better environment for it.
---
You literally think you can't do anything wrong. Cute, but this isn't open world PvE. You CAN negatively affect your team by playing awful; hence why teams often don't want baddies around. Sorry!
---
Yes, and playing in a 1v1 doesn't depend on the comp of your "1" because you can't mix and match between the races. 
---
Yes, and the champions that weren't played aren't played for the reason I stated, especially a champion like Tryndamere. 
---
\&gt;  Given how each spec still has a wide range of diversity in traits, stats  and weapons providing at least one build that is viable for each mode  is doable yes. 
---
Cliff Ranger is already a viable strat for Ranger. Are you just unhappy that the viable build isn't viable the way you want?
---
\&gt;  E.g. you can reduce necros wvw power relative to pve by shifting power  from aoe to single target, or corrupts to dps, or allow them to trade  support or safety for dps. 
---
Yes, take away the necro's identity because its strength are actually useful against real players. 
---
\&gt;  You can promote berserker in wvw by not completely gutting it right  before you add spellbreaker so it can survive as higher burst spec in  pvp / wvw. 
---
Neither see much play outside of small groups. 
---
\&gt;  Or even as condi spec. 
---
Condi specs are \*awful\* right now.
---
\&gt;  The lack of balance is also shown in how specs and setups can be  irrelevant in all modes. Scepter ele isn't top tier anywhere in the  game. Neither is staff ele.  
---
I'd understand complaining if a class only had a single weapon to choose from, but making all of the weapons equally viable isn't worth the time. 
---
\&gt;  Dagger on nec is pretty awful all over 
---
Must be why it's used often in wvw lmao
---
\&gt;  Scepter is meta everywhere 
---
But you just said it wasn't on ele anywhere
---
\&gt;  I also think balance state where all specs are viable in all gamemodes is possible in gw2 
---
It's not.
---
you either click less, or you don't move your mouse. neither is objectively better than the other.
---
Put a tag and a leg before the event starts. Basically asking for help.
---
Trust me, it works. I did it yesterday and even asked to do the ach where you blow the doors of 4 other prisoners. Good luck!
---
only 50?
---
Collectibles are like half the content in the game nowadays, game is pretty alt friendly but not exactly as much as FFXIV. There's some minigames, especially in Heart of Thorns there's cool little games. Housing is pretty much non existant but Guild Halls are kind of like that. Exploration is as meaningful as you make it, there's a lot of random and hidden lore if you care enough to slow down and see it. You do seem pretty suited to the game from your description.
---
&gt;iirc
---
https://lionsplaza.com/
---
&gt; From WoW i like the huge open world to explore and the alt system, i like to create multiple characters, also, i love how much collectable stuff like mounts there are in game.
---
You'll love gw2 then because a huge majority of content is open world and achievements.
---
&gt; Fron FFXIV i love the out-of-combat stuff like pet racing and other minigames, also the crafting (i would like to know how crafting works here), and the developers that have shown total commitment to the players, also i'm a big fan of housing, i don't know if there is something like that in this game.
---
Gw2 has jumping puzzles, some mini dungeons, adventures (HoT maps mostly; PoF introduced griffon adventures), beetle (mount) races (kinda same like adventure). Housing isnt that developed, but guild hall has some elements of that.
---
&gt; From ESO i love how the questing always means something and how exploration feels, i love to discover the world and enjoy every aspect of it.
---
Gw2's basic model is not telling you what to do but let you explore all you want instead.
---
New meta: play a ranger in wvw, know nothing about your role and the current state of the class in the mode and complain about getting kicked.
---
If people would not fake LI, there you would be no people in LFG at all because you need to fake LI in order to get LI in the first place.
---
As you play the game and unlock the things you want you end up with gold piling up quicker than you think. This ends up with people crafting legendaries just because they can. It's not always about who's credit card is the highest level.
---
its part Mass Effect Mako, part Skyrim horse
---
some bosses are still optimal with epi bounce spam. Condi necro is basically required in pug mursat overseer and souless horror, and heal scourge can hard carry VG.
---
More bright white light.
---
Honestly, they need to make the portal device and addon if you already have the world boss one.
---
&gt; I know a lot of the community has come to expect big, complicated and over-the-top for legendaries, but I find the best looking things are the simplest.
---
Sure, but that doesn't really seem like the point of legendaries. To me, legendaries are a way for the developers to go absolutely wild and make weapons we would never get otherwise, if you want simpler weapons, why not just use simpler weapons?
---
How would that work?  Serpent's Ire, Palawadan Raid, Death Branded Shatterer, Keep/Oil meta?
---
Precision can't be removed, only replaced with something else, only replaced with something else that would 'spread' more dps builds rather than them being mostly Power or Condition.
---
Such a drastic change cannot be done in just any skill update. It'll have to come along a new set of elite specializations.
---
I wish I could upvote this comment more than once. This is the reality behind kicks in WvW 99% of the time.
---
Had this even funnier experience this weekend where the commander wanted people to first join discord and then whisper him/LT a specific thing to be able to be invited to squad; everyone that tried to join would get refused unless they had veto'd them. So night is going fine, we're having fights and things are pretty active when suddenly one guy starts YELLING in discord about how he joined discord and just won't stop getting kicked from squad, really angry and aggressive towards the group/commander. We were all quite stunned he was that mad especially... We had no idea who he was or that he had joined discord at all since that was literally the first words he said out loud. We tried to calm him down and explain to him and he just ragequit the discord!? People are crazy &amp; entitled.
---
Episode 6 trailer? :)  Yes...? :)  
---
Ok   :(
---
Cripple: -50% movespeed
---
Chill: -66% movespeed AND +66% skill cooldown
---
Why do you believe that there was edited proof? Op does not know if that was the case, he just assumes and claims that.
---
Silverwastes are unlikely included since the meta is not on a fixed timer. Originally I preferred map-based progression like SW but with such a gizmo I guess fixed timer makes more sense.
---
for path of fire stats, I completely skip exotic weapons and go straight for ascended because its only about twice as expensive
---
How the fuck did you manage to warp my words that badly?  Read "this attitude is awful" 
---
that's all i said with respect to your comment
---
Also in all honesty i doubt this actually happened like you say it did, comms simply aren't kicking scourges.  Unless it was some guild 50/50 raid or you didn't join comms and there was 50 or more or something lol
---
Considering next week is "Remember Episode 5" week I don't see why anyone would expect a trailer for Episode 6 today.
---
A ROLE is not the same as an entire GAME MODE.
---
They could implement it like wvw skirmish chests which you can open in bulk though a vendor
---
I like light armor a lot, but I think that's mainly because I've always been in fond of mage classes in MMOs.
---
What I like is that it is looks very simple and elegant at the same time. It does not cover your character with a massive armor, only most part of the body. It's like wearing town clothes, nothing very fancy but it's very simple and offers a lot of diversity to explore.
---
As for the least appealing, I'd say medium especially due to the amount of trenchcoats it has lol. I find it really hard to play fashion wars on a medium character because of that. Even though they don't look bad, it is just not my thing.
---
Also heavy armor, I don't really like the way it looks in general (in other MMOs as well) because I dislike "bunkering" my character kinda. Nonetheless, the legendary armor comes with great effects and a beautiful design so that'd be the exception for me.
---
Those are pretty much the reasons as to why I prefer light over the other two, but again that's my personal opinion and I have to admit that some people come up with really nice armor combinations no matter the kind of armor.
---
Light. It's the only armor that can properly have some pants along a variety of chest armors.
---
I'll be honest: I have hundreds of LI and one set of Perfected armour and I still down to shakes way more than I'd care to admit.
---
Sound great! I've heard that in GW2 looking good its very important for most players , how is the looking system (transmog, outfit) here and why people say that?
---
This is very situational. Basically, the op is complaining that he can't be accepted in a role that is a role rangers are not build to be. They can get by but they are the last option of commanders cause there are maaaaany disadvantages that come with them. Rangers can also do great in wvw, but not in the situation mentioned: large group battles.
---
According to gw2profits, there are around 0.5G-1G worth per salvage.
---
Sounds like a game for me, Sound great! I've heard that in GW2 looking good its very important for most players , how is the looking system (transmog, outfit) here and why people say that? Also, besides dugeons what other PvE stuff people do?
---
I know, I know. Was just wishful thinking since episode 5 is currently available and therefore there isn't much to remember, it's fresh in everyone's mind.
---
&gt; I also think balance state where all specs are viable in all gamemodes is possible in gw2. I.dont believe anet is capable of it.
---
But Anet doesn't decide what "viable" is, players do. And you have to really reach that 0.1% difference before they loosen ...
---
wow im out of time for this year but tagged for next year
---
Eh, since 5 is the current episode it was possible we weren't doing a 'remember ep 5' week and we'd just jump in. That or we'd weirdly get a trailer a couple weeks out.
---
Or just host your own groups, or join training discords, or join groups with no LI requirements...
---
oh lucky you!!! I wish I had it to cultivate all characters :D
---
Wew SPOILERS!
---
I skipped that actually... Still I wonder how it is gonna work....
---
The flying system will get you hooked for sure
---
That might be easier if you only consider raw DPS in PvE, without how and where it's applied, just a few numbers to tweak here and there. But WvW is more complicated. You must consider the aoes, the boons, the frequence of boons, the quality of boons, the personal survivability....
---
All of these point out some very lacking classes in the game. For balance to come, it would need a huge rewriting of their core (even if it's just for WvW).
---
I mean, yes, the balance is awful. But what's the solution ? How would you rewrite ranger ? Even a very vague idea ?
---
I mean I guess Casino Blitz also counts as a meta?  The majority of Path of Fire content is instance dependent and not on a set timer.
---
Sound great! I love the fact that there is no gear treadmill
---
Nah no worries. Like I said, the class is buggy at a core level lol.
---
Interesting how I first adressed what you were talking about which was that you "cannot negatively affect them in any way" by giving you 2 examples that prove that statement wrong and then I added another perspective and you're crying "how dare you be so goddamn toxic"
---
k, i'll be toxic then; fuck off, leech
---
tbf it was pre gyro patch, and scrapper effectively neutralized almost everything mirage did, so rip them again
---
I thought I was missing something, googled "umber" first thing is game of thrones, me: "NOPE"
---
Could have had a [GoT] tag or something. :\
---
Sure, but this way you would have 90% less people in LFG.
---
We could of course get in-game system that allows to check one's kill count but this community would consider that elitist and toxic, so instead we have to work with what we have.
---
I only ping 252 LI as a joke when I've already got a "verified" spot.
---
do you happen to have any links for the new skips in W2Z3?
---
Massive fights, which typically occur with some range of stand off, should absolutely be a ranger's specialty. It's the same concept as a hammer revenant, but they actually have effective boons and better damage output. The problem isn't necessarily the core design, it's that it's outperformed by other classes so egregiously it's completely excluded from grouping. If you want to join a tag you typically get laughed at before being kicked/denied. Having a class like that in a game is not healthy for the game.
---
People just seem to be unable to take small chunks out of the process at a time, and think they need to do everything straight away.
---
I play Mesmer only but I gotta say, Asura's tier 3 Heavy Armor is my favorite skin, wish I could somehow mix them.
---
That bow was the MacGyver of bows though. It was almost a Green Lantern Ring so much it could do.
---
Why remember the current episode?
---
If you are going for the infusion only 1 of them is worth it and it saves you about 10seconds a run. And I've never seen any videos about that skip, I just randomly found it out with my friends.
---
The other one is too inconsistent to do on normal runs.
---
Sound advice! My problem is usually failing to read the animation in time, though. (If I do see it coming, I try to jump right into Slothasor with Distortion)
---
This was back around the Warclaw launch. I had found this group because they had sounded nice on launch day. The comm would come online and ask for players in map chat and team chat. We were having a fun time casually running around for about a week. I had even gone in these squads as a reaper, asked if it was okay, and they said that yeah it wasn't meta but they could always use my DPS. It was that group that got me to grow out of my comfort zone and run the meta scourge build. Nice, right? Open to new players, exactly the thing new blood coming into the scene needs to see. You're welcome here, and here's where you can be more effective.
---
Then one night the same requests for players goes out to map and team chat the same as always. Since the last time the group met, I had been taking camps to casually build reward track progress/pips and Reaper tends to feel better for doing that (since realistically no one's jumping people flipping camps and, when they did, they were often bad and I had a 50/50 chance of killing them first). So the request goes out, I join EBG where the tag is, join their discord, join the squad, and go to write to the squad asking a basic question about scourge that I wasn't sure of. Before I can finish starting my question, I'm kicked. asking around, my sin was that I had MF food because ... that's what you fucking run in open world so you get better loot.
---
This wasn't a tryhard guild raid, this was advertised in the map as something they wanted normal people to come to. The squad wasn't full, it was just starting with about 20 players. This was from someone who had previously been very open and understanding with new players doing an about-face for seemingly no reason.
---
As a bonus, it continued a few days later when the tag, in discord, told everyone he was going to ping the wrong waypoint in map chat in hopes of trapping new players in the wrong borderlands. This basically killed any enthusiasm and hope I had for getting into WvW. That someone would be that fucking two-faced and insidious over a fucking meaningless matchup with no reward for doing better than the other two teams. I realize that I'm probably an edge case, but it's just disgusting the level of glee and enjoyment these people get out of fucking with people.
---
nope, core sword/dagger thief, with deadly arts, trickery and acrobatics
---
Personally i hate being told what to do and that's why i love gw2 so much, i can do anything i want without a mandatory story quest (FFXIV for example).
---
Sounds like you found your home :)
---
For alts your wallet is shared on all alts.  Even your lvl 2 has access to your level 80s bank account.  When you hit end game masteries you unlock for all the characters at once.  Alts get birthday gifts so the older they are the better the goodies.  Things like very rare/expensive dyes of your choice.
---
For the out of combat content, there are jumping puzzles, mount races, several time-limited festivals, and activities.  They usually line up with common real-world holidays.  The Mad King shows up in October, Wintersday in December.  
---
For crafting you can gather from all the nodes provided you have the right tool so you don't have to strategically choose what you can gather.  You can deposit all crafting mats into your bank remotely.  What gear you don't need you can salvage using kits to get mats back. Check a crafting guide to see what ones will appeal to you.  You go to your workstation, try mixing mats to find new recipes, craft gear with the stats you want or the skins you want.  (We are called 'fashion wars' for a reason)  
---
Since you like to explore you are rewarded for exploring by XP, goodies, transmutation charges to change the look of your armour, occasional keys for the Black Lion Loot chest (which is some utility stuff and some cosmetics.  But also by events.  As you run around you will see an orange marker.  That is a live, group event.  You don't need to party up, just jump in and start fighting.  The more that get involved the tougher the event becomes.  Even if a lvl 80 pops into the starting zone they are scaled down to your level so they will not one hit kill everything.  And you cannot kill steal so don't hesitate to jump into a fight.  They also regularly release a new map with more story called Living Season episodes.  These events can be timed events like defend a town from centaurs for 5 minutes or one where you fill a bar by killing, collecting and the usual quest stuff but if it is not your cup of tea feel free to head off to find something else, your contribution is noted and when the event is over you get XP/reward according to how much you participated.
---
Housing is not as good as in other games.  You have a home instance and NPCs from the story will start appearing in there, you can lure cats into your home instance if you like cats.  I think I have 20 or so now.  But overall I just never visit it.
---
Then there are the collectables... there is a collection of just spoons you can work on.  There are so many miniatures you can get ranging from notable people to, generic NPCs to animals.  Personally, I love animals.  There is a baby Gryphon you can get in one of the older living Season maps that is my current favourite.  You get several base mounts that have different uses but the different skins are a money purchase, I wish a few could be earned by achievements.  
---
Other than buying the expansions and the Living Seasons that you missed (if you are active all new ones unlock for free as they are released) you do not need to spend money.  The store is cosmetics and some quality of life stuff.  You have to earn the truly high-end gear, you cannot buy it.
---
When you log in and finish the starting instance ask in the map chat if you have any questions, you will get lots of help.
---
Pasta'd
---
I like Pharus a lot, and couldn't be bothered with
---
 the chaos LB skin, it was a suitable skin for my warrior. My ranger wields Kudzu, being a sylvari ranger with racial armor and the druid backpack, it fits. As does Pharus for my female Norn warrior, in raid leggy armor, with Ad Infinitum. As for leggy count: per 1000 hours played I have roughly 1 leggy. 2 Bolts, Kudzu, Pharus, Bifrost, Nevermore, Meteorologicus, Howler, Rodgort, Shooshadoo, Ad Infinitum, Warbringer, Leggy Armor (6 pieces counts as 1), Aurora.... On 14k hours played. I'm happy as is, but no longer striving for more leggies. Then again, I said I was finished crafting leggies before the release of Pharus.
---
Well, if we count my characters of each armor tier, it would appear that I like Heavy the most: 3 Guardians (1 Dragonhunter, 1 Firebrand, 1 retired bank), Herald, and 2 Warriors (1 Spellbreaker, 1 retired bank) = 6 Heavy characters.
---
Compared to my Medium characters: 2 Rangers (1 Druid, 1 Soulbeast), 1 Deadeye, and 1 Scrapper = 4 Medium characters
---
And my Light characters: 1 Scourge, 1 Mirage, and 1 Weaver : 4 Light characters
---
However, I tend towards the "Medium" aesthetic almost across the board, if we disregard trenchcoats lol. My Dragon Hunter and Herald both make "heavy" (hehe) use of the Braham's armor pieces. The Dragon Hunter, a female Norn, also makes use of the Houndskin Mantle and some Norn racial pieces with fur and leather aesthetics. My male Human Herald makes use of some Vigil pieces that have an even mix of leather and metal aesthetic.
---
Out of my Heavy characters, my Firebrand is dressed like a Largos and also makes equal use of leather aesthetic. Out of my non-retired Heavy characters, only my Asura Spellbreaker has a truly "heavy armor" aesthetic.
---
Meanwhile my Light armor characters are anything but lightly dressed, each mostly covered from head-to-toe in combat-appropriate cloth/leather armor. They may look like mages, but all three are battlemages at least and make use of a mix of cloth and leather.
---
The context of this thread was a soulbeast ranger getting specifically excluded for his build. Not because he was just a PUG player, but for his build. That's the context in which you replied and said that he was "griefing" the zerg by trying to follow them when they didn't want him. That's the context in which I asked how the hell is the soulbeast griefing, when he can only help the zerg by stance sharing? That's the context in which you replied that, well actually, he can be a rally bot and he can reveal them in stealth, and that's the context in which I replied to you and said that you're not talking about Soulbeasts anymore, you're talking about all PUB players period, and that's a separate discussion that has nothing to do with the original guy saying that he was excluded for being a Soulbeast.
---
That's why your "proof" of me being wrong wasn't proof of anything; it missed the context that I was comparing a Soulbeast PUG to any other random build PUG, not a Soulbeast PUG to **nobody**. 
---
Now, if you want to talk about your idea that following a zerg with **any** build is griefing: yeah, screw you, you're toxic. It's not "leeching" to want to play in the open world PvP game with a big group of people; that's literally the game. That's how new people get into the game. If you seriously do not want that, the best you can do is not tag up, because then you won't have randoms thinking that you're somebody to follow and maybe they'll lose you the next time you WP. 
---
But you have no right to your own private gaming space in the massive open world PvP mode, and you're shooting yourself in the foot long-term trying to force people away from you. You have no tools to police that. Don't even try. Be welcoming, ffs.
---
I mean, you can have a mix of both. Over the top art but a simple and sleek design.
---
Dolyak stance is Jesus button. 30 second ICD, AOE (if traited), stability and immunity to all movement impaired conditions as well as cleansing on activation. Not op at all. Totally balanced. How long has POF been out and this still exist?
---
Healthy game design requires rewriting their core; balance itself does not. They can iteratively shift balance where needed, they just seem to be so slow and bad at this that a balanced state is never even close to reached.
---
So rangers are actually worth inviting into squads?
---
If I say 'medium' do y'all promise not to kill me?
---
People are just mad about gem store weapons competing with legendary shines. I mean who care about running around being the only shiney player. Let's all make these little lights of ours shine baby.
---
I usually see Daredevils running with Sword/Dagger and Staff, and Deadeyes leading the charge in ganks, but base Thieves not so much. Just my experience though
---
That not everyone gets (source: have been playing GW2 on and off, haven't played in a year, didn't know)
---
Norn cultural ftw.
---
I actually like the heavy armors. Carapace, Gladiator, Order's armors, Draconic and all the scales variations... as someone who love a semi-realistic look for his toons I found in the heavy armor more and better options than in the other two.
---
Medium and Light have some design I like, but for something way more specific.
---
I've asked people to ping jp.
---
I just want to know their favorite jumping puzzle.
---
I don't need them as shards, I need them as levels on my newly created alt.
---
If only those didn't exist, people would still run dungeons for experience :(
---
&gt; but ingame is 12s
---
9, and the 50% duration applied to allies is 50% of the base duration, so it applies it for 3 seconds.
---
Dolyak Stance, and soulbeast in general, have legitimate potential in Zerg v Zerg, especially lower mans. The 2 reasons why dolyak stance in particular is lacklustre are-
---
The 360 radius. This is a huge killer. People dodging damage in the wrong direction can put them out of range, and you have no re application if the first proc misses, which brings me to point B-
---
Soulbeast lacks the support to be a support class, or the dps to be a dps class, making it impossible to slot when you consider you are removing scourges or firebrands for it. The DPS of a frontline soulbeast CAN be amazing, but it’s not as high as a staff thief or even just power scourge for a much higher risk. 
---
If stances become 600 radius, and some slightly better aoe power dps options because available, soulbeast could be a legitimate pick. If ANet leave sit in its current iteration, it’s destined for meme life :(
---
The trait gives you 12s of personal duration, but still only gives half of the base duration to allies. They get 3s. This is for the Dolyak effects (soft CC immunity), not the stability buff. The stability is always 5 stacks for 6s (before boon duration) and isn't affected by the trait.
---
I see most of questions got answered. Im just going to refer to 5th
---
Thief has great solo open world build with 2 pistols. Also it has okay build but not a meta with a rifle, which is based off being a sniper.
---
Engi does have rifle and pistol, but it rarely uses it since most of its time it spends in kits/holo. So youll more likely fight with holo sword, bombs or grenades, switching between them in a rotation, where you would use maybe just 1 or 2 skills from rifle in that rotation. 
---
Afaik rifle is used also by warr and pistol by mesmer(not sure tho). They wont use it in any meta build tho. 
---
This is why id rather go for thief if you fancy using black powder weapons, since it will be closest to what you would want, actually fighting with them and using them
---
5 (soon 6) Living World updates, 2 (Soon 3) raids, and a handful of Fractals are the big things.
---
yer I noticed you edited your post to include the other one :)
---
I own the whole series on disc.  It is mostly cringe-worthy, but there are some nuggets of gold in there.  I just wish I could retroactively remove Bobby and Uni from the whole series.
---
Just by logging in, you get the latest one. You get a green Story starburst above your minimap to indicate it.
---
If you mean the ones they are giving out as part of the Welcome back promotion, they *arr* in the gen store. On the main page, there is a big banner about it. Click the banner. Starting this morning is Episode 4.
---
But, but... Gary the Snail is in all regards better than Patrick &gt;\_&lt;.
---
you missed a few elona events - casino blitz, burried treasure etc etc
---
just sounds like you never learned how to farm optimally.. I make a full set of leg armor recently.. took 2 weeks
---
That isn't what I meant, I'd imagine they are all useful to you since you've gotten all the slots for them, I'm just trying to think of how I would be able to fill 24 slots. I only have 9 slots, I could definitely use more like 12 and I could imagine 16-20, but I can't imagine 24 unless I just filled it with raid/fractal food/pots.
---
Well, we're talking Guild Wars 2 here. You can leave to any of the multiple political subreddits you already participate in if you want to waste your time any further.
---
Most of us around here aren't even American to begin with, and we could give less of a damn about your petty first world problems.
---
Are you okay? Would you like me to call the whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaambulance?
---
or you could learn how to farm properly?  try joining a silver wastes guild
---
That one got removed ages ago when they did the last trait revamp.
---
It's no longer in the equipment panel, and it exist only as traits in the profession mechanic trait like, like Discipline or Beast mastery.
---
No it doesn't. You pointed towards how detailed the weapon is, and I pointed out it only has 2 basic elements. Its not about the weapon looking good or bad. My point was that the weapon itself isn't any more detailed than a non-legendary weapon from BLC.
---
As for the on hit effects, it is again not very detailed. Beam of white light and some smoke. Compare it with Kudzu with its vines, grass and flowers on hit and its variety of colors and you can see how it doesn't have that much detail.
---
We have images and videos of the weapon itself and all of its effects. I don't see why we need to own it. If anything owning the weapon can make an owner biased in evaluations, given that they spent over 2.2k on it.
---
Nah they'd rather deny it.
---
I think any game is going to have that, really, especially if you have any ideas or concepts you'd like to see realized but probably never will be. Hell, I come up with Elite Specialization concepts frequently and then have to remind myself not to get so hyped because chances of them happening at all, let alone how I imagine, are next to zero.
---
You know day 1 of the next Legendary Greatsword's teaser you'll have some loudmouths crying that it isn't what *they* wanted or how *they'd* imagined it being. Some will love it, some will be neutral towards it, but we'll get memes about how the "surfboards were way better" and "combine these two weapons and it's basically the same thing, so lazy Anet!!"
---
So I think it's not only normal that you find a game both joyful and also disappointing at times, but it's the mark of an invested fan.
---
Heavy, light, medium. Medium armor is the worse in My opinion (and i'm a main thief)
---
Dragon's Stand is what happens when you try to explain what doesn't need explanations.
---
Agreed, I’m running with Azureflame on my DH and I think it looks way better
---
Right, but if they could remove it from the UI entirely I'd prefer it honestly.
---
No worries!
---
The best part about warrior is our first elite spec. Sure, mesmers learned to manipulate time, revenants channel an ancient dragon champion, whatever. But warriors? We just learned to get SUPER PISSED and set everything on fire!
---
* Story as it exists in the stock game is vastly different from later releases. The "1 on 1" cutscene style is removed completely even from Living Story Season 2. Quality slowly goes up more and more throughout the years. Season 2 you don't talk at all (or very very little at least). HoT kinda set the bar for how future releases would work: Fully voiced but outside of "1 on 1", as in your character just talks in the world. Beyond that, you'll get some highly detailed cutscenes during very significant points in the story. The overall quality of boss fights DRASTICALLY increases as well, so keep that in mind. No more using some boring ass cannons.
---
* By far my biggest pet peeve in MMORPGs are, yes, fucking guilds that act like they're doing you a favor by allowing you entry. Mandatory Discord participation, mandatory event participation, mandatory lotteries... But, there are always bad guilds in every MMO. It's particularly irritating in ESO where being elitist is basically required. Keep trying, and look in particular for guilds that are "just starting out" or "are casual".
---
2) Well... yes? Why would you be in a guild if you have no interest in doing things with the guild?
---
Sounds like Serpent's Ire, maybe?
---
From what I can tell you get a lot of shit for existing at all in PvP anyways.
---
1) I agree - I don't enjoy the story mode either or the long movie dialogue. I only do story for the rewards and stuff but other than that. Nothing much. Nice views to take screenshot for the gw2 instagram though!  
---
2) Find a better guild. I found mine. \[DRNK\] - No rules but don't be a jerk. If you are NA and in Yak Bends; we are wvw guild but we do other things within the guild. Play whatever you want however you want. We still kick butt even while we are drnk on thursday LOL.
---
No thanks. This should be a feature in-game for everyone by the way and they know it.
---
1- Yeah, the OG personal story is mostly lame. Some of the 1-30 stories are really interesting and you can see some forshadowing of a few things at least in Sylvari story in what came in HoT. One of the funniest stories I found was the norn "blacked out at a moot" story eventhough I don't enjoy playing norn.
---
2- It really depends on the guild. My main PvE guild used to have organized events but the leader is mostly off working on his pHD so we can now do guild missions on our own and socalize among ourselves. Guilds like that tend to feel "dead" sometimes which leads to the opposite end of the spectrum with guilds that demand you rep them 99% of the time or be kicked and you must do their events etc. A nice middle ground would be a guild like SAND. They do guild missions, run events in Dry Top (and sometimes other places) and they're generally talkative in guild chat and just overall an awesome part of the community.
---
Nice skin. Terrible weapon. Do enough fractals wvw and pvp and you hate every range you see wielding a longbow because all they do is afk lb12 and thats it
---
They will finally be able to put back Gen 2 legendaries on their site: https://heartofthorns.guildwars2.com/game/
---
I forgot when they finally took it off, but they were on there for a few years.
---
Well, you certainly "aikido" them with facts at the very least.
---
cheaper waypoints, bar boosts
---
*stealths but stands in the exact same spot as before*
---
1) gets better
---
2) na/eu? can hook you up.
---
You mean formerly rich, right?
---
ok
---
Medium, sometimes heavy.
---
really? i know a lot has changed but is this not true:
---
youre squishy, weak auto attacks, you rely on damage from shatters/phantasms
---
phantasms are long cooldowns, they die when you shatter and die when the target you summoned them on dies, so their damage is wasted
---
phantasm spawn is random so you often dont get good use of their attack (example GS phantasm vs warrior GS3)
---
That second, in organized groups, can mean the difference between surviving and dying.
---
Compared to the story in season 3 and beyond, the initial core vanilla story is like a still-life painting whereas the later seasons and especially the latest episode are like Michael Bay films. The cutscenes in the vanilla story were, in my experience, universally hated by the majority of the player base at launch so they've departed from that format for good reason. Even as a GW1 veteran since 2005, I found the story slow and hard to get into until season 3. I attribute this to the notion that ArenaNet wasn't super clear on the direction of the living story and how it would fit into the game until around HoT. They've definitely come into their own since and I highly encourage you to not just discount everything story even though you have had bad, though valid experiences thus far.
---
From now on all my lfg's will be female charr only state your legion upon entry.
---
If only :-/
---
It is a scam, but it's also the only way for a dedicated wvw player to get legendary armor, so there's that
---
I’ve spent good money on this game but never to buy a legendary. 
---
http://i.imgur.com/KY7ICWr.jpg
---
being alive in the end only means you spend the event sating safe, not risking it all to make it happen. who does determine good or bad players.
---
but that's a good thing
---
We dont even ask for kp. Just if youre new or semi exp just say so ffs. We. Were paying attention had a druid scourge for no green vg and noticed after that we had a power quickbrand and a healer dh? Both joined together and said dps and healer kwe werent payin attention about the healer part lol) i personally watch for plat pvp badge on dragon hunters and w4 cm titles. Those 2 are a no go for me because they end up dieing within the first minute
---
For what it's worth, I enjoyed Path of Fire and (so far) living world season 4 *a lot* more than the core story and Heart of Thorns. The writing is a lot better than the dialogue is "real time" instead of those cutscenes you get in the core story.
---
Discredit LI as a rate tool altogether, demand valid in-game option.
---
Sure would be awful if matchmaking suddenly became more social and people were forced to get to know the people they're playing with /s.
---
I declined an invite to guild missions from a guild that has advertised here on reddit and was kicked after with no message or warning. Sorry I have limited playtime and would rather spend my 45 minties of playtime productively rather than earning 3 guild commendations. The same guild wouldn't let me join them in w6 when it released because I hadn't killed dhuum although I met the rest if the requirements, geared professions, correct roles, met benchmarks, etc.
---
Heavy outfits on light classes, Light outfits on heavy classes.
---
I will get a lot of downvotes but i will be real about the MMORPG genre.
---
Do you Want a lot of endgame content and challenge content? FFXIV
---
Do you want the BEST PVP in a mmorpg RIGHT NOW? ESO
---
Do you want be casual, still get the shinie stuff and NO ENDGAME(you have but is really nothing challeging you have fractals that you will get bored after half year, dungeons are dead and raids are a meme right now)? GW2
---
Do you wanna know WTF is Blizzard doing wrong? Wow
---
Those are the best but if i going to be real there is no such thing as hardcore gaming in gw2, but if you have like only 1\~2 hours a day and wanna acomplish stuff, this is probably the game for you.....
---
Gw2 is probably one of the best mmorpg out there but the lack of content just makes me sad....
---
Medium, tho light has the most variety
---
1) That's what a story is. Story is not for you if you're not interested in the story as a whole, and only there for the action.
---
2) Those guilds are around and don't advertise their guilds, because they have a very specific clique. So, even if you join them, you may find yourself having a tricky time becoming part of the clique.
---
Cliques exist in all guilds, but it's especially bad in the type of guild you're looking for.
---
Someone from my guild always does this just to check if anyone is paying attention.
---
250 KP? Thats just silly though. The only kp people ask for is Dhuum or Qadim. Nobody has 250 Qadim kp at the moment, and youd have to be insanely lucky to have that much Dhuum kp.
---
Also, Ive seen the opposite happen regarding wipes on high kp lfgs, where people are way more impatient and unforgiving and leave straight after a single wipe. Its silly, we're all human and mistakes can happen, but these people are out there too
---
Sounds awesome
---
No, the problem is that the map is inconsistent with that explanation they're going with. The "official" explanation is that the map is not repeating and that the only time the pact takes down the Mouth is when the Commander takes down Mordremoth. But because of fucking Laranthir, there's this weird bullshit about repeating events. It's not an area where explanations hurt, it's where poorly-done explanations hurt.
---
We sometimes ask for bananas, sometimes for a food item of your choice, or like "something you would put in a salad." One guy pinged a stack of spikes, so that was solid.
---
I guess I already own it because it doesn't appear free to me in the shop
---
Please stop faking it.
---
Please stop pinging it.
---
Please stop asking for it.
---
let a muted YT video run in the background.
---
"Play a class that other people want you to play"
---
No
---
&gt;You want people to get hooked and turn into long-term WvW players? Let them get a taste for what large scale combat looks like. I promise you, the one time out of a thousand that they a) stick with you tight enough to give away your position, b) miss the Veil or whatever other group stealth buff you're throwing down, and c) are noticed by the enemy who correctly deduces that this one guy is indicative of a larger mob, will be more than made up for by the fact that you're going to be getting more people into the game mode and you'll get more and better fights as a result.
---
This was exactly the experience I had the first couple days of the Warclaw. Routinely massive queues and huge, fun, messy fights everywhere. Aside from the calls in team chat for new players to "GTFO of my game mode," it was fucking awesome.
---
Would be a good idea, but so many traits would need to be completely changed, lots of Condi builds a have RNG Condi procs on crits, or Condi flat bonuses that get stacks Everytime you crit.
---
Raid and fractals DLC - some REAL content for a change. Not just living story blabla.
---
There's temporary things like foods, amulet upgrades and boosters. Those can still be shown in the rewards panel.
---
All other MF is account bound since they removed it from gear, and there's no permanent  mf bonuses.
---
Lul imagine kicking someone from your guild for faking something to get get into a raid instead of just... ya know.. helping them?
---
Probably part of the reason he faked it in the first place.
---
My raid group loves Soulbeasts. Can't speak for everyone, but at least you'll know some folks will take you. Power Soulbeast is excellent DPS, and even Condi Soulbeast is pretty good in my opinion. The Shortbow-only rotation is very easy and at minimum is good enough for bosses with no invuln phases, like Cairn.
---
Guild hall total max deco limit increased and the substantial increase of the local area deco limit!
---
Maybe try clarifying with the dude recruiting you that you wont be able to attend guild missions all the time?
---
So.. what you want is basically them going completely away from the core principles of Guild Wars 2?
---
Why not both?
---
You can have a simple weapon with all the features of a legendary (footfalls, projectiles, etc). They just don't all need to be supernovae. I think variety is the way to make the most people happy.
---
Amen to that, I use a combo of norn cultural on my warrior and guardian!
---
What is LI?
---
Their gameplay?
---
If they join with real or fakes 250LI and then suck, They're going to be kicked anyway.
---
The whole 250LI thing is a waste, especially as you can fake it.
---
It'd be quite an undertaking, so it's not something that can't be done  on just any skill balance. It's require preparing things before hand, changing some skills, traits and sigil in preparation, then adjusting after the change.  
---
And it'd be something that would be done better along a huge change that shakes the balance a lot, like when new specializations are added.
---
i have crafted 3 legendary weapons, legendary armor, legendary trinket and legendary back without gems to gold.
---
you wanna know a secret?
---
its usually the people who have only crafted 1 or 2 legendaries who did it with gems to gold.
---
those who craft "20" are usually also those who play quite a lot and developed an understanding whats most efficient to make gold. also its those who enjoy actually playing the game, and not use twisted logic like "gold to gems is the most efficient time-wise. i make X$ per hour, converted to ingame gold thats more than anyone could make by just farming"
---
just my 2 cents.
---
Light since there's a lot of skins that don't have any kind of cape. There's a lot of flexibility.
---
That and my main is mesmer.
---
However there can be some nice heavy armor combos that seem bulky but not too much. So I'd call that my second favourite
---
Dulfy you're the best. All hail the AP Queen.
---
I wasnt the one who kicked them. I think the reason they were kicked was more because of how disrespectful they were to people on the matter. Said something like 'it doesnt matter if I lied, it's only in a game'. And the hardcore raiders in my guild have their own set teams of 10 usually.
---
Yeah i was actually worried about replayability but for what people says it seems to be a lot
---
I would like better optimization. 
---
Now I haven't played in a long while, other than lining story run throughs with the wife, but I would gladly dump another 4k+ hours into GW2 if it just simply played better.  It's hard to justify the struggles to get 50ish frames on low/medium when newer games still max out at 120/144 at medium/high.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
Can you also /gg to checkpoints people have reached in SAB tribulation mode?
---
They really should have made a proper looking Stormbow and had that as a legendary.
---
Because I like creating numbered lists:
---
1. The combat. It's very freeing and not stiff, yet it's still pretty robust.
---
2. Loot is shared. None of that 1990s who shot it first crap.
---
3. Events are amazing. No need to check quests with your party every 10 minutes. No need feel like you have to walk away from a cool fight because you forgot to talk to an NPC 20 miles back.
---
4. Fractals. It's just a cool way to reimagine dungeons and progression.
---
5. The music. It's good.
---
6. The economy. You can accumulate quite a bit of wealth almost everywhere, you don't have to do the best of the best farms to get rich.
---
7. THE PLAYER CHARACTERS. Like seriously, I still can't name many unmodded game where the characters look better than in GW2. They may not be the best from a tech/graphical standpoint, but they stand the test of time.
---
8. The business model. The fact that you can use ingame gold to buy the cash shop currency is great. I'm a bit of a purist, I could afford to buy this stuff with real money, but that ruins the fun of the game for me.
---
9. The animations. Everything feels so alive.
---
10. The ease of getting back into the game if you take a long break. I don't think this game suffers from much of a "flavor of the month." A vast majority of the time new content does not kill old content and there's not usually a time rush to get there.
---
More raids and cultural armor.
---
The petty tell of the shake always makes me double check what the hell sloth is doing. I still get caught more often than I care to admit. The slams are where I get triggered by now. Joining a 150LI group only to have two downstates in the first slam is infuriating.
---
Theres currently soo much story to go through right now so youll have plenty of time. And to build your first legendary (if you go for gen 1 legendaries) youll need to map complete core tyria so youll be busy for a long time lol. Legendary gear is just super shiny special effects and qol stat changing ability.
---
The amount of collections titles and just achieves to complete is just stupid. Played since launch and i still only have half the ap done but i also dont try to burn through it all.
---
For real. The obsessive overemphasis on a garbage, contrived "FACTIONWAR!!!!111" storyline is part of why I'm not playing WoW and *am* playing GW2 right now.
---
Arenanet...how difficult was it to include the functions of this portal in the portal that was already there? (World bosses).
---
Literally played WoW for years... it's in a horrible state. 
---
WoW doesn't have factions under trademark lmao
---
Stepping on the checkpoints in trib mode does not update the checkpoint location. You need ALL players there for them to activate. The same thing with checkpoint clouds. Having more players in trib mode doesn't offer much of an advantage since you all need to make it.
---
So if WoW is in a horrible state, why do you want to bring that shitshow over here?
---
It's not that bad for roaming! The only big issues I find are mesmers and scrappers. I find I can't \*beat\* a scrapper, but can hold indefinitely denying a camp. Mesmers I just don't know what to do with. Everything else is down to skill. I don't think I'm particularly good, but i can still beat the majority of people I find in WvW at 1v1 (if they aren't a mes or scrapper).
---
I think holosmith or spellbreaker would be a strictly superior choice for roaming because they can hold more people more effectively, but revenant has been really fun to roam with lately!
---
&gt;thief is about dps/burst/evade
---
Correct
---
&gt;Mesmer is about illusions damage/boons
---
&gt;ranger is dps/healing?
---
Druid is a very popular healing class, but the 2nd elite spec of the ranger (Soulbeast) is very much about damage and self-sustain (think pvp bunker)
---
&gt; is thief all about waiting for the team to engage, then go in to assassinate and clean up?
---
No. Thief, like all other DPS classes, is about dealing damage with the rest of the group while everyone else is dealing damage in Fractals and raids.
---
In PvP Thief has more mobility than anyone else and can do that whole "quick burst then break combat" approach.
---
&gt;Is Mesmer played like a fight initiator with its illusions? Which is more depend on mechanics to survive or more tanky? 
---
Mesmers usually have 1 or 2 items with toughness so the boss targets them, but they by no means tank the hits. They use evasions, blur, aegis, and distortions to avoid the attacks.
---
Username checks out
---
I understand. I just like the idea of open world events that are world pvp based with pve elements and whoever wins the battle and kills the mob gets a chance at a nice reward, takes control of an area for needed end-game resources for crafting, etc.
---
&gt; Dagger on nec is pretty awful all over. 
---
except in raids/fractals when running heal/support scourge.  it has the best life force return.
---
You're a pretty short sighted fellow, aren't you? lol
---
The GW devs have clearly done a great job at taking old or normal concepts and making them refreshing and really fun. I have confidence that they could do a good job with this idea, as well.
---
To add to this, it'll be quicker and easier for them to get you access to your old account if you can provide them with as much information as possible.  Character names, serial keys if you purchased the game, around when you played, when you stopped, even what guilds you might have been a part of are all bits of information that can help prove it was yours.
---
I started in WvW as a Herald and I just cannot go back to it once I saw the effectiveness of Spellbreaker and Weaver over it, both in roaming and in Zerg utility they bring. I love my Revenant but I really cannot in good conscience advise a player pick it over literally any other class for most content.
---
My personal record in w2z3 is 25 minutes, what is the world record or how do i check?
---
its 11:26 by lulleh or 11:27 cant remember
---
Don’t play ranger if you don’t want to get kicked from a parties every other patch
---
I mean, the dogmatic adherence to not letting you play with your friends in TYOOL 2019 isn't the *totality* of why WoW is in a god-awful state right now. :P It's just a very glaring omission when even its relative "peers" allow for it.
---
The worst part is that if it were a technical limitation and the tech debt that would be required to be "paid off" to allow it would be actively detrimental to content development, I think people would accept that. I know I would. But the fact that it's always couched in banal chest-beating "WE CAN'T FORGET THE ***WAR*** IN WARCRAFT!!!!!!11111" nonsense is where I lose the plot entirely... *especially* after we just spent multiple years in a "yeah, the facts are fuckin' morons who can't get shit done, I'm going to strike out independently with other members of my class and *actually* make a difference" as a story beat.
---
Personally I'd prefer not. I thought that was one of the stupidest bow designs I've seen in along time
---
2 things then: the game you want already exists and you admitted yourself that it's a shitshow, and if you're looking for FactionvFaction content, we have WvW in this game which is kept distinct from PvE and will continue to be so.
---
Buuuuuuuut I might need it!!!
---
Agreed. I have Opinions(TM) about WvW and the fact that if you want an original-flavor legendary you're required to participate in it, but that's not a discussion for this thread. It's very nearly sequestered off on its own where you can participate if you want to and not if you don't (to wit, I've never even entered WvW both because I'm really not interested *and* have no idea where the hell to even start), and that's how it should be.
---
What I've taken away from this is that everyone who is salty here feels insulted because they go around reporting people all the time.  A typical milenial attitude.  Tell mom and dad or the police every time you have a small problem.  Because they are incapable of handling anything on their own.  Just shove your responsibilities off to someone else to supervise you since you are children and apparently require that.
---
Okay sure, it's toxic to call out that what you're wanting is a WoW port. I see we resort to buzzwords instead of backing our arguments, huh?
---
The game has had some pretty huge changes over time, and while it's due for something new once again, PvP in PvE just isn't going to happen. It goes against the core philosophy and separation of game modes. "Faction" fighting exists in WvW, that is where that type of content calls home. PvE events that spontaneously pop up have been added over time, and they, like the rest of PvE, require working together towards an objective. And frequent, small scale skirmishes and objective control exist in PvP. Could each mode receive changes and see growth that shakes them up? Yes, and they should! Should each mode bleed into one another, blurring the lines and forcing PvE-only players to engage with content they'd rather not, or forcing PvP players to second-guess their mode, or stick smaller guilds against titanic guilds in a fight for resources the smaller guild will never be able to get in such a case? Hell no.
---
Not worth an inventory slot ;/
---
What's your bar for mistakes? When I pug, or when my static uses pugs, the bar was "can we likely get the kill" which leaves a lot of room for sub-optimal DPS and some mechanics failures (even deaths).
---
Thief is a high mobility, high crowd control, DPS oriented class.  It's a bit squishy, but has tons of escape and mobility options. It also has great melee and ranged weapon choices. In PvE, it is primarily a Power DPS class, although in certain raid encounters it has incredible support capabilities with its steal mechanic.  In PvP, thief likes to use its mobility to create pressure around the map, and gank to turn even fights into advantageous fights. 
---
Mesmer is a weird class.  It comes packed with tons and tons of utility, and Chronomancer turns that up into high gear making it an incredible support class.  Its damage won't match thief's, but it can be built to do pretty good damage.  Mirage turns it into one of the best condition damage DPS classes in the game.  In PvP, Chronomancer is one of the best bunker classes in the game, holding down points and drawing enemies to you so your allies can do things across the map.  Mirage is a burst damage duelist who wants to pick off isolated targets.
---
Ranger is the class with the most diverse build choices in the game; if you like buildcraft, then Ranger is the class for you.  Each ranger build can be adapted to provide as much party utility, or as much selfish DPS boosts, as you'd like. Druid is primarily played as a supporty healer, pumping out insane boons and buffs to party members.  It can also be a hybrid condi DPS+support, which is my personal favorite PvE zerg build.  Soulbeast can either be a strong power DPS, or a condi DPS, with a bit of party buffing on the side if you chose to.  In PvP, Ranger has a number of build options: from the duelist "Boonbeast" build, to a mobile longbow build, or bunker druid.
---
&gt; Also, are there any class that plays like a battlemage (tanky but also deals decent damage)? 
---
I'd say that Necromancer, specifically Reaper, is the tankiest damage dealer we have in the game.  Firebrand (Guardian) is a tanky melee-ish mage fantasy as well.
---
Imo season 3 is where it starts to get better. HoT is annoying as shit just because of how the maps are designed in layers (Tangled Depths is rly the only issue) PoF was awesome as hell and loved the season after. Core is boring but also consider how long ago it was made
---
What do you mean, just blow the bomb in the stack and you'll be the only one left to dps! Sure way to win!
---
100% agree on your assessment of heavy. Personally I gravitate towards light instead of medium though.
---
I think it depends on your character type. Light armor looks great on my asura.  Light armor looks like absolute crap on my charr.
---
1. Season 1 refurbished.
---
2. Cantha.
---
3. The Domain of Winds.
---
4. Areas never visited before
---
 * Charr homelands.
---
 * Janthir
---
 * Doern Velazquez's original lands.
---
5. The far North.
---
1) Yes, the story gets a lot better as you go. It gets more interesting, as well as being more refined (mostly drops cut-scenes, advances at a more reasonable pace, etc.). Personally, I think it really starts picking up at the end of season 2 (and later, PoF is also another big improvement step), so since you're most of the way through the worst of it, I recommend to just keep going. Skipping to PoF would be a really bad idea, because the main plot in PoF is built around subverted expectations that you've had since very near the beginning. On top of that, one particular 'arc' would have a greatly reduced impact, especially because it involves looking back at what you've already done (or haven't done yet, in your case). If you're interested in the lore/story itself, it's worth doing it in order. 
---
2) I've not really tried guilds yet for this reason. I want to play on my own terms, and don't want to feel forced into doing certain things at certain times. That being said, I'm sure there are some guilds out there that are happy with that; just keep looking, and drop the ones that get pushy.
---
But that still goes against the core principles of Guild Wars 2? Your answer doesn't really have anything at all to do with what I said.
---
A student of the Skyrim School of Climbing.
---
You will be fine. My husband pretty much sent me all the mats for one of my legendaries and no one got into trouble.
---
The other thing to consider is the fact that everyone else in the match is connected to the same server. In fact it's also the same instance. A desertion also means OP didn't rejoin the match so that was either more than just a disconnect or OP intentionally abandoned the match.
---
&gt; You have no idea what "meta" even means. 
---
There has been one in any multiplayer game for quite some time now ...
---
Your scenario is awful to imagine, but I can see it happen basically everywhere online, especially in a competitive environment. What we can work on is not getting rid of the metas (we can't), but explaining and guiding those players, not laugh at them.
---
Boon support heal isn't bad in fractals.
---
Move the raid team to this. This is less of a waste of dev time than raids.
---
&gt; A desertion also means OP didn't rejoin the match so that was either more than just a disconnect or OP intentionally abandoned the match.
---
In fairness to the OP, they also might have disconnected near the end of what looked like a very one-sided game and not managed to get back in to the match before it ended.
---
Unlikely, but I've had it happen in other games, so I'm at least a mite sympathetic.
---
Yeah after doing W4 1-3 for 3-4 times I started faking LI. Never got kicked.
---
1. You can always make it to gold: https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/karma Personally I bought all the karma skins (both weapon and armors) which you can get ingame for fashion wars and the rest is mostly for miniatures and things like that.
---
2. Again, https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/legendaries is a dream for this since it takes all the stuff you need to do and puts it into smaller goals. Also, once you enter your API at the page it already factores in stuff from your material storage and bank, so you can easily see what you already accomplished and whats missing!
---
As for the second reason, why do you want to build a legendary then? Just because you like the flashy look (nothing bad about that)? Because of the convinience? Personally I build only one legendary so far and that is because I can use it on quite a lot of different characters and I like the look of it. So maybe build a legendary which a lot of your classes can use.
---
One more thing: if you've stat swapped a raid weapon in the forge (for example, it's "Zojja's Spire" now instead of "Malicious Spire" or "Malicious Treasured Bough"), it's no longer a "raid weapon" and will not give shards when salvaged. Transmuting a raid weapon will allow it to maintain raid weapon status.
---
Light is not too far off from medium for me. I just play medium classes more than light classes, so maybe I am a bit biased.
---
Cantha and some Cantha-themed elite specs pls thx
---
I want WAY more "current events" content. I feel like right now it seems like something happens in an area, then there's no more reason to go there, unless you are re-killing world bosses, doing world completion, or gathering.
---
The Awakened invasions and Anomalous Occurrences were fun, but their play-ability is limited to whenever you max the achievements for them.
---
Tyria's a big world, Anet - make it a LIVING WORLD! Random monsters spring up out of the ground, terror in the streets, world-wide call to arms, that kind of stuff!
---
You fly almost anywhere, there are specific areas like jumping puzzles where mounts in general are disabled, and older instances.
---
But 99% of the game is mount friendly.
---
Ahhhh I see. Instead of linking an achievement or gear, people link how many of these they have? (Coming from the WoW raiding universe)
---
Well, in guild wars 2 all races can be all classes, and it encourages alts through a ton of shared content, like the bank and high level gear, and materials.
---

There ya go, not worth going for imo, really inconsistent.
---
Superb run!
---
1. You can use karma to buy obsidian, which you'll need a fair amount of for #2.  There are also some guides around for converting karma to gold
---
2. Go to gw2efficiency.  If you have an account and add your API key, look at the material list for whichever legendary you want to get (when you decide).  You may be further along than you think!
---
2a.  If you like your current build, and don't plan to change your weapon choice any time soon, go with one you currently use.  Getting a leg for a build you're not using is entirely pointless.
---
It's not that silly. You don't have to waste time on people who lie about gear if you can check.
---
Per the release article: “Keep track of where the Pact’s next big battle is going to be with this clever portal device for meta-events around the Maguuma Jungle, Dry Top, and the Silverwastes.”
---
I am
---
Shitty guild leader made officers hate him, they made a new guild which has like, the same members, same casual guild, I forget what the guild name is.
---
You dont remember [this](https://i.imgur.com/2Jyqs1X.jpg) scene?
---
Curious to see how it aligns the metas for Silverwastes. Guess I'll find out when I get home.
---
1. Obsidian shards, especially if you want legendaries. You could also see if there are any skins you want that you can buy for karma.
---
2. Just start! It's a long term goal that's going to take a lot of time and resources. Farm every node you see and don't spend gold on things you don't need. If you want to plan ahead, use the wiki or gw2efficiency. If that's overwhelming, just assume you always need more of everything and keep gathering your resources.
---
Only you can choose what legendary you want, but if you want to make one you'll currently use, scepter and torch are both good options; a few other classes can make use of them. If you do like the greatsword, go for it. You might eventually have a character that will use it.
---
I made them unlisted at first, they are delisted now.
---
Here's a few though there are other skips:

There are ways to determine at which point connection is lost between you and Anet. Go google.
---
 My personal character on Guild Wars 2: Yaru Magitek. She's a Necromancer / Reaper and I love it &lt;3 It's been a long time since I had in mind to design all my characters, I wanted to start with her because I currently enjoy using that profession XD Next.. Mesmer or Ing, maybe :/
---
This was so good, so glad I tuned in to watch that lol
---
I don't want it to be removed, I think is fine as it is. 
---
Look at the biggest games esports wise, LoL and the likes, they have precision as a stat there. And you either give yourself in to luck and lucky shots, or you go all in, 100% crit chance, but then you're very squishy.
---
To give you some perspective - there is a farm place which is much more interesting than the usual "stand in one area and kill respawning mobs" which is 5 years old by now, and doing it you can easily farm 15 gold per hour.  
---
So about a week of 1-2 hour farm everyday and you can have a rad mount skin which you can dye to change its look dramatically.
---
Slow is a condition that increases the activation time of skills and abilities, reducing animation speed by 50%. Dodge and skill movement speed is also halved for the duration. Crippled : Movement speed decreased by 50%; stacks duration.Chilled characters appear blue tinted, move 66% slower and skills recharge ~40% slower. For every 1.66 seconds chilled, only 1 second of cooldown will have expired.
---
Exotic to ascended is only a 6% improvement btw. For condi vs power: power is better for trash mobs but condi does get stronger vs high health enemies. Also for stuff that has phases power is better. But ya theres a lot that helps to know while going through the game for the first time but doesnt tell you. Rip
---
&gt;Gear is not the carrot on your stick
---
Probably the most important thing for people coming from other MMORPGs to be aware of. There are *many* endgame pursuits, but having to get new gear because your equipment is made obsolete by a new update coming out is not among them.
---
When Will Coalescence release ?
---
Thanks for the response!
---
I love Gw2 efficiency! I'll have to take a look!
---
It would be up the the devs to think of how to introduce that. Political issues, or maybe completely introduce an invading force from elsewhere.
---
[EG] the drama queens of GW2, second only to /#first from Nike and DnT
---
Thanks for the feedback :) Honestly I love the black and white style, almost minimal :P or like comics. I also made another version of this design, adding a color or two without shades in some parts, but I didn't like it very much :(
---
If this device warns you every time Breach/VW begins and let you teleport on correct IP... Thats worth money, imo.
---
Oh right, I forgot about those, thanks. Will add them when I get home, editing this in my phone would break the format.
---
Looks like that Crystal Palace from some of the World Expos.
---
Cc and breakbar should actually be mentioned. Completely forgot my self lol
---
The sickly-pale-yellow watermark on a black-and-white art piece looks very unsettling.
---
You won't see it as much in action-oriented games than in stat based games.
---
GW2 may be kind of a hybrid in that regard, but it's still more about action, movement and dynamically adapting that stacking buffs and using skills in any particular order.
---
I'd be happy to skip the rewards. Most of them is unsellable unsalvagable garbage gear. Losing the two or so unidentified dyes and three boosters would be completely worth not having to click through all that.
---
&gt; new elite specs
---
IDK about that. They're already having a hard time with balancing the ones we have. Adding *another* set on top of them would just be putting salt on the wound.
---
this for 2500 g? are you mad? :D
---
Non science, also not feels, facts. Whether its Sokal his hoax, the grievance study hoax or all the other hoaxes inn the past, if the same group of fields is regularly shown to be a field in which the biggest nonsense can be published, even trough peer review (not the case for Sokal BTW it lead to peer review) and is generally accepted without question by "academics" just because it uses the right political keywords then it is pretty clear there is no more science to be found there. The people in the field made a complete joke of it themselves, they have become trash and are hopelessly corrupted, and above all no place of actual science.
---
&gt; They are now non science, also not feels, facts.
---
Present evidence. Oh wait. There is none.

Since you were playing last time around end of Living Story S1 and you weren't here during introducing lots of features, I suggest you keep any of your old characters for birthday gifts (dye packs, skins, leveling up scrolls etc.) and roll new one because in comparison to March 2014 game differs much in features and how some things works.
---
As for crafting: recipes are now unlocked account wide (since July 2016) so that makes leveling up crafting on other characters easier. As feature crafting is easy - 4 items combined discovers the recipe; once you get the recipe you want and if it's profitable to sell the intermediate product you can do that - set the amount, press button and then sell or list crafted items. Crafting does require materials but you can obtain these during regular gameplay; some people prefer to allocate their time on farming trees, ores and events in order to obtain materials. Moreover, salvaging items also gives some materials in return - for most of the time it will be tier 5 and 6 after you hit level 80.
---
Regarding builds: there are dedicated sites maintained by community. Be aware that both expansions introduced two elite specializations - kind of "sub classes" for each profession available in game. Thief can become daredevil who can wield staff or deadeye who can use rifle, while engineer can be a hammer-wielding scrapper or sword fighting holosmith. Equipping elite specializations grants you access to new pool of skills, while maintaining core profession skills. Only one elite specialization can be used at the moment but you can freely switch between these (if you own both expansions) or core profession.
---
Unfortunately, much of the community doesnt share your sentiment. It's not any wonder why the game hasn't been able to maintain much of an audience for WvW and PvP; which is consequently why most of their money is funneled toward PvE. Like I stated before, I love this game. I love Guild Wars. I spent so many hours playing GW1 when I was younger. It breaks my heart to see their game modes are as mismanaged as they are, but it is what it is. Pretending it isn't a problem isn't helping anything, downvoting me when I bring up valid criticism isn't helping anything. It's your game I'm trying to make better. I already left. Whether you voice your own support and make change for the better is on you.
---
No not CC. Focus on the concept of Interrupts and Stun breakage and we'll get better community.
---
Lets ignore the evidence I have given right? Sokal hoax, grievance studies hoax.
---
Add [Pact Scout's Mapping Materials](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pact_Scout%27s_Mapping_Materials) to the list of items in need of a "Consume All" option.
---
Well, I play for the journey not for the reward, if not i would have quit the game long ago
---
oh, right! man, I totally forgot that entire part took place.
---
I need to work on my memory lolol.
---
Leave the guilds that bother you, keep looking around, there's some great guilds out there, but they are not as common as the bad ones :)
---
Honestly, a large problem is the negative connotation people have with “social justice”. People look at it as trying to keep others down instead of what it is: trying to raise people up. 
---
As an example: I’m a nerd, love video games. As a kid those were generally frowned upon. Now, video games are generally more accepted. Esports are slowly becoming a thing. Schools have esports clubs and teams even sometimes. I love seeing this sort of positive representation of what was once looked down upon. 
---
Given the opportunity to host a club at school I would absolutely host an esports team or club over a like 12th athletic sport team/club. 
---
I’m not trying to put down the people who want a lacrosse team, I’m just trying to help make video games more acceptable.
---
This game has none of that.
---
1. They changed how the dialogue works after the core story.  Now it is delivered as you are running around/fighting with no cut scene.  
---
2. Some guilds are very task-oriented, but normally they tell you outright the expectations.  There is always another recruiting in chat you can check out.
---
Based on the stuff you like from WoW, you'll probably really like GW2. Exploration is a very big part of the game, and the world is pretty huge by MMO standards - it can be hard to tell due to scale and speed differences, but by my estimation you could fit an entire region from, say, FFXIV inside one of the larger maps in GW2, and there are a fair few maps to explore even in the core game. Making and leveling Alts is easy and rewarding, as it lets you try new classes and unlock valuable rewards, and there's plenty to collect as well, mostly in the form of Weapon and Armor skins. Unfortunately a fair amount of the things available are obtained primarily from the cash shop, but many can be bought from other players as well and you can buy Gems (the premium currency) with Gold if you're really desperate to get something without spending money. Mounts are very different from other MMOs, but I think you'll like them one you get to that part of the game.
---
FFXIV definitely does a better job of things like minigames, crafting and player housing, although I would say that GW2 does a much better job for seasonal content. The crafting system is pretty solid but it's nowhere near as engaged as the one in FFXIV, and minigames exist but they aren't particularly well supported and a lot of them are tied to seasonal festivals, or otherwise aren't particularly rewarding. Housing sort of exists in the form of Guild Halls, which can be decorated with a wide variety of placeable objects and the like, but it isn't really designed with single players in mind - the time and resource costs are very much balanced towards it being a group effort. It's a feature that there has been a lot of demand for, but it isn't something that the devs consider a priority at the moment. The dev team at ANet is also very committed to GW2 and the community, although they've been going through some rough patches of late, and while they don't have the same rock-star quality as Yoshi-P and company they're still pretty good people.
---
As for what *I* like about GW2, the distinct lack of grind is probably the single biggest selling point - the game is designed with a focus on horizontal progression rather than vertical, and it makes for an experience that I, as someone who isn't a huge fan of grinding in MMOs despite loving the general gameplay structure, find very enjoyable and rewarding. The combat is also excellent, combining the best aspects of a traditional tab-targeted system with some more action-oriented elements to create something fast-paced and flexible with enough different ways to play for anyone to find something they enjoy. The story is also pretty strong (by MMO standards at any rate) in my opinion, which is nice if you're into that sort of thing.
---
Or they are lagging
---
Read my first sentence... I clearly referenced how it's not about the actual weapon look, it goes beyond that. In fact, most of my comment was aimed at legendaries in general. Don't even see the point in mentioning Kudzu since I wasn't even comparing the two in the first place. But what you mentioned about it is exactly what I'm talking about. It's those details.
---
As for bias, that may or may not be possible, sure. But then again it goes the same way for people who don't own it. Not having it, or even worse, not being able to or not having the patience to make it can result in more negative feedback in some cases. Humans are humans. 
---
Take tech reviewers for instance. There's always that speculation before they have their hands on something. Once they have a hands on its a whole different step, and once they've had it for a month or two there's a much better review. Same goes here.
---
I personally collect legendaries. I also own lots of neat looking BL skins. Some looks are just better off with a regular skin instead. That's the beauty of fashion wars.
---
If you wish to differ in opinion, that's great. There's no right or wrong here. I've stated mine and stand by it.
---
just show 1 kp and you are golden. even if you dont show any i am fine, as long as you can write "used all kp" or something. as said, we can see if you are unexperienced.
---
Thank you!
---
fair, guess i have to kick myself now :D
---
All guilds are just drama, and then they all just quit. Bunch of casuals.
---
If you mean the checkpoint after the ice bridges, yes, there is one coin right next to it, so I guess this was No. 7.
---
You need 18x +9 Agony Infusions wich go for less than 7gold at the Tradingpost.
---
You can go for 12x +9 Infusions and 6x +7 to get exactly to 150 Agony Resistance. Its less than 100 gold to get the needed AR and you will gain about 50-60g from fractal dailys so you're even after two days to begin with.
---
haha, wups
---
You’ve been lied to for 5 years.
---
"Jumping and holding forward and hitting the wall the at a certain angle, while spamming dodge." 
---
That's what i was looking for, thank you for posting the videos! C:
---
I'm not downvoting you, but I guess that's a global "you" (damn English) ?
---
And even for PvE, they don't know what they want, going from left to right, and coming back ...
---
Alright that sounds alot more reasonable than what i recently encountered.
---
How about not using it. I don’t use it and my gw has never crashed.
---
Again, I hope to not lose the rewards just for the sake of convenience. But to each their own.
---
Blame A-Net for not including a proper kill proof system four years since raids released and counting.
---
Encounter clear speed (as a percentile)
---
If I am not wrong, thw whole zone go up the mountain. I remember falling in some parts and being at the start.
---
I dont know extacly where you guys are, but maybe if you keep forward, you will find places to jump to previous floors.
---
I assume by second mountain you mean where you take the portal that leads you to the areas with lighting all the tiles to proceed rather than straight to the yeti fight. I know of no way to return to that first mountain area.
---
But there is a shop that sells keys in the second mountain area that you can still access and return to the chests in that section. It's the one shop in the foggy area with all the rams and ice bridges that's well hidden if you didn't know to look for it. It requires you to play a song while hopping amongst disappearing clouds to open a secret room leading to the shop.
---
I know that sounds confusing, but it's hard to describe otherwise. The chest before that whole open area with the fog and all can be backtracked to by facing the way back at the tall ice ramp area and jumping up on the ledges to the right. I thought I had no way back up without infantile clouds for a while before I realized there was a way to jump back up.
---
I'm on EU
---
Those runes are so expensive 😥. I want it!
---
The luckiest I've gotten is getting a focus called "The Bard" which went for about 90g
---
Thanks that's really helpful
---
Pretty sure this is based off the photo of a developer's baby, which means they are probably an adult by now.
---
Pretty weird to think about.
---
I completely agree with you. I only have 43 LI and 9 LD from my raid training guild, but I tell the groups that when I join. (If the LFG is almost full, I'll whisper the commander so I don't clog up or close the LFG only to get told I don't fit. I make sure I'm playing one of the classes they ask for (and know how to play it) and if one of my alts is another class they might need, I'll say that. If I've only done the boss once, I'll say that, too. And the golem in the Special Forces Lobby isn't there for decoration, so far as I know, so I'll spend time in there a couple times a week beating on it and practicing. Almost always, commanders are okay with this. It's about communication.
---
[Legendary scepter Xiuquatl](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Xiuquatl) is one of the prettiest legendaries in the game in my opinion, **and** as a bonus it gives you a permanent companion snek. Sounds like the perfect legendary for you.
---
In organized groups you probably have resistance anyway.
---
Sure thing. It's spam dodge jump though, otherwise you'll just roll off the wall or do a normal wall jump.
---
I can recommend rti.enjin.com and maybe few other discord based guilds once i find my bookmarks
---
I consider LoL to be much more action oriented than Gw2 .. not really sure what you mean with that. I thought the whole point was that having rng in crit damage can win or break a fight, but if in a game like LoL, that, as I said, has a much bigger competitve scene and is way more balanced (to some extent, comparing the 2 isn't exactly a good thing to do). having rng in crit damage works, I don't see why it wouldn't here. Its not as if this is a game breaking thing.
---
May be a good stab but other classes can bring stab and so much more to the table
---
If that's how it works, then it's very good value indeed.
---
TL;DR: L2P.
---
Guardian can be built as a battlemage, in heavy armour either as a power core/dragonhunter build with a scepter, or as a burning tome wielding firebrand.
---
I really don't think that people who might manage this wall of text would have problems with understading the game.
---
It is others we have to deal with.
---
I just wanted to make the point that from my experience there is a massive difference between 250KP and 50KP groups. And some people (like me) have fun in clearing content in a very clean and effective way with the least amount of mistakes.
---
And to add to this: I dont mind if someone joins a high KP group without having the required KP and then asks if he can join because he knows his stuff. I did this myself and was thankfull so many groups in the LFG didn't have a problem with that.
---
It's a curve. For the average, casual player, your gear won't be invalidated by general game updates. For people who are super into raids and Fractals, balance patches almost always force gear changes.
---
I still find it weird that people tout GW2 as the pinnacle of the "no gear treadmill", but in GW1 a single 1.5k gear set and 4 headpieces would cover 90% of all your gearing needs. Meanwhile in GW2 any time they change a single Chrono skill I have to redo my entire set, and any time they modify any amount of crit buffs I have to do the DPS carousel where I have to turn a bunch of berserker into assassin's or vice versa. I also have a bank tab with piles of trinkets that have been made obsolete (grieving in particular) but can't be changed because they've already been infused or attuned the maximum amount of times.
---
[There are options!](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/)
---
Quit your damn crying.
---
It's not really elitist to say that, obviously I get downvotes for defending an unpopular opinion
---
I did not recognize him being the same boy... oops
---
I just want to add that dungeons are not really dead. Sure the lfg seems empty for the most part but thats because people refrain from making one. If you take the initiative and put yourself on lfg the group fills up rather quickly.
---
As a new player, thank you.
---
Every time someone asks me "so then what's the point of playing? What do you achieve?" I always struggle because it seems like all you *really* achieve is unlocking cosmetics.
---
Just think about how many skills you can use while moving in games like wow and lol than skills you can use while moving in GW2 and games like first person or third person shooters.
---
GW2 may be based on using skills, but it has actually more in common with other games with free movement than with games that cancel skills if you move while using them. In free movement games, criticals come more from how and where you attack, like aiming for head shots. We can't have 'headshots' in GW2 because of the shared collision boxes to prevent people from picking smaller races, but we can still move while attacking much more than in more static games.  
---
Because of that, it makes more sense to have criticals from positioning rather than RNG, like with flanking attacks.
---
I guess deleting the unsellable gear is an inconvenience itself.
---
I love those pants but holy shit 90% of all human heavy armour females use it
---
Because other than its very brief draw animation it looks incredibly similar to other bow skins that already exist.
---
Eg chaos bow
---
You made a comment to legendaries in general *in a thread about Pharus, where people are discussing Pharus*. I talked about a specific point you made about legendaries, in that legendaries are detailed. Since its a thread about Pharus, and Pharus is a legendary, I countered that Pharus isn't actually detailed. 
---
Then you responded with a comment about the looks of legendaries, which I didn't comment anything about. Then you talked about how Pharus has more effects than normal weapons, that still wasn't relevant.
---
I countered by comparing the special effects of Kudzu with Pharus, since comparing Pharus with BLC weapons when also taking special effects into account isn't fair.
---
Then you said you were talking about legendaries in general.
---
It took you 4 comments to finally say something about the details on Pharus, of which you just said 'I disagree' with nothing else to add.
---
Well the story moves on to season 2 were you still read a lot of the dialouge but then at Heart of Thorns nearly all dialuge in voices so your character will feel more alive and the story mode more intersting. Imo it is totally worth it but hard to tell how others should feel about it.
---
As for guilds, imo ask this questions before you join a guild. Ask what rep rules they have, what they will demand of you and what you need from them and so on. This way you don't get to join guilds that do not suit you.
---
Looks like you’re using your head as an arrow.
---
I used to whisper the commander and ask before joining. I feel that's more polite.
---
Fair enough. I like Pharus, very much. There.
---
Updating dungeons to make them new and more challenging would be really cool
---
Yes, and that still doesn't have anything to do with the details on Pharus.
---
Great write-up, thank you!
---
I have played this game for 6 years, gw1 before that, and I am realizing now that I don't truly understand these basic concepts of the game. So I'm keeping this up and re reading it a lot to absorb it. However, this is really my first game I'm really getting into and long term. I never played any game for any length of time, to ever get to understand any basic concepts of the game. I'm not even really good on endgame. \[And this one is not really an endgame one, more like which endgame are you working on now?\] So now I know some things, I have some hand-eye coordination familiarity, some idea of what is going on, and what each area of goals require and what you can get, and what some things mean \['utility skill'\]- and I can survive harder things...without hubby- all the time....now I need to go back and see what 'cc' is and means, though I've ran all way through dragonstand meta, and what each skill actually does and what that means, and how that coordinates with other skills/people/healthbars, and traits and coordinating armors...which I am understanding some concepts, but not what they really mean for implementation....and I am not a quick study. I learn well, not fast. Plus when hubby wants to help...its hard not to go easy route sometimes...I mean....I am not ready for feeding a fish to a beedog....I just have gone to all the festivals in last year to really get into them \[steve was scary fun\].
---
So, in conclusion, this is a good read for someone who has been around, but still 'one of them'...but hey..I'm always good for a loot bag in DB... ;)
---
You don't understand. I'm talking about people who, for all of their MMO careers, have been progressing. Doing content to progress by getting better gear. Doing content to unlock other content that contains better gear. Grinding skill upgrades. Character points. Whatever you want. Once you hit Lv80 and get your set of exotic gear, progression suddenly slows dramatically. You are, essentially, done. The only progression left is masteries and those don't actually do anything dramatic that makes you better in content.
---
Playing just "because it's fun" without any kind of progression-related reward is an utterly alien concept to most of the people I know. Not just foreign, *alien.* "You keep playing for six years even though you don't get any stronger or progress your character any further" is not something I can say unless I want even more disbelieving questions.
---
I'm guessing this isn't actually cannon since he reappears in the event where we go to Joko's burial.
---
I wish I still had birthday boosters. I already ran out. I've still got the means to get heroic boosters/Black Lion/bonfire boosters, at least, as well as LNY fireworks.
---
I'm still stuck in early Bronze, and I know it's going to be quite a long time just to get to Silver for its pip bonus. I heard EBG is the place to go for power-leveling, but from my own experience, that depends largely on how busy your team is.
---
Honestly don't even know why they bother with Armor Tiering in this game at all in terms of skins. Everyone's running around in outfits or stacked infusions in PvE anyway, and if people are that annoyed by having the easily recognizable wieghts in WvW/PvP they can just turn on standard models. As much as the slow erosion of the game's visual design through outfits and shinies irks me at this point Id be willing to take it for the sake of putting heavy shoulders on a Necro.
---
oh, i also used a macro so i didn't have to dodge jump on my own, how does that make you feel?
---
I've never made a legendary and may want the new GS legendary when it comes out. What do I need to start gathering?
---
You can lose every game and still make progress, but you'll go faster if you win. It goes about 60% slower if you lose all your games. Even with that, though, matches tend to last 15-20 minutes, and realistically you will win SOME games.
---
i bet you look down on people that haven't done deathless runs in dark souls
---
It finally died off from drama and a shitty leader iirc, I think a bunch of the members made a new guild but can't recall the name.
---
Yeah haha, started playing a few days ago and was pretty excited to see this post.  The concept of this games endgame is pretty alien to me.  The game was pretty cheap so it wasnt the biggest loss in the world but kinda realizing that the game just might not be for me.  I guess the moniker fashion wars 2 wasnt a meme.
---
Well, *the* [Crystal Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Palace) was built 1 and a half centuries ago in London; and looks like *this* [Crystal Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palacio_de_Cristal_del_Retiro) was built only some 30-something years later in Madrid, also for a fair. Seems like a trendy thing to build for the time :3
---
&gt; I don't get many ranged attacks as a Weaver.
---
What? Youre kidding right? You have staff and scepter.
---
Needs less Charr
---
Because protection, heals and simple dodge are not something that enemy can do.. Or they can simply push through you while you're casting your lb 5.
---
There's nothing to rez because they won't get downed or they'll just rally because rangers would die much faster to cc and bomb from revs and eles.
---
Pure stubbornness and being an idiot apparently.  I’d give a lot to get weapon swap.
---
Contemplation of purity is one of scariest skill icons from gw1.
---
The 4th category of sylvari cultural
---
wow almost like it was based on somethign hmmm
---
Hmm. A scepter might work well.
---
I feel like Chrono is the profession people complain about being nerfed the most but... well, basically what this post is saying.
---
Lets take [Pharos](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-89854) as a good example. You'll need:
---
* Mystic tribute (that's always going to be the same so lots of mystic coins, clovers, T6 mats, etc)
---
* Gift of Maguuma Mastery OR Gift of Desert Mastery (again, normal gen 2 legendary requirement)
---
* The gift for the new weapon
---
* The precursor
---
So besides all the stuff that is staying the same, expect the precursor and gift to take the new kind of shards and replace things like the gift of wood with metal and oiled longbow parts with greatsword.
---
For the shards you'll need huge amounts of elder wood and mithril for he expected 290 new shards. For two handed legendary weapons it is better to [craft 400 off-hand shards and convert them](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Enormous_Chest_of_Legendary_Shards#Notes) to 300 of the new shards (meaning you can start working on the shards now if you want).
---
If you're on NA and want to join a guild that doesn't care what you do with your gaming time, send me a PM. As long as you don't care about hardcore raiding and competitive PvP, because we're casual scrubs.

And I understand /u/Zosin's reasoning. If a group is asking for each person joining to have *three hundred* raid boss kills, then it's perfectly valid to expect the group to not have to rely on a crutch strategy that is an absolute snoozefest and makes 70% of the fight irrelevant for 70% of the squad.
---
If you're doing ranged strategy, specify on LFG. I've left multiple groups that don't specify and then say they're doing ranged strat, because I raid to have fun and if I wanted to stand still auto-attacking I'd play open world.
---
What purpose does that serve? You'd be right back to the same place you were before.
---
Next time someone has an exam: Good luck to your brain.

Easy world record, already did it. 10min 20sec. 1min 7 seconds faster than the previous

---
I remember getting kicked from a Caudecus Group for having less than 3k AP. Pinging the collection achievement reward didn't help, I just wasn't experienced enough for them.
---
Luckily, they've spent another 20 minutes on the LFG finding a really experienced fifth guy.
---
Hey, True Shot crits for 8k, you can one-shot a Dredge with that Big Boy Damage :v

The Simpsons did it.
---
If you don't want people to fake LI, you should stop asking absurd amounts. I've been raiding every week for three months now, done all bosses from wing 1 to wing 4 multiple times. I do Wing 1 about 3 - 4 times a week and can almost do Sabetha in my sleep.
---
"W3 Xera, 300+ LI" - are you fucking kidding me?
---
My response to these absurd requirements is: Whisper the person posting them, ask them if they are serious? If not, join the party and have fun. If they are: I don't want to raid with people who need a 300 LI party to do a glorified DPS check.
---
I know what these conditions do, the question was why do you want cripple to be reworked, it's a simple movement speed debuff.

Mhh seems the only difference is the Axe/scepter, rest is the same
---
It is, though. In all my years of pugging, i dont ever recall kicking an underperformer for not having the the proper gear...90% of the time its because they are simply not doing mechanics and dying alot, at which point it doesn't matter at all what gear they use because they will suck at it regardless
---
5+ year and I’ve only reached 9k last week 😅
---
You are awesome, wonderful skip btw
---
*Tell me your secrets, master*
---
I can’t join a group because I donated all my KP to guild bank for decorations, since I thought groups only required LI.  Which is fine, because raiding in this game is donkey balls anyway.
