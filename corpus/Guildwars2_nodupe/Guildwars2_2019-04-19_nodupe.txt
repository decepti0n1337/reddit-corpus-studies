In case there is more than one flag, a loop should do the trick, right?

It's funny because I actually just ordered the collector's edition this week as well. Hoping it comes next week!

I hope you enjoy it!

Fractals are dungeons, just renamed. The same basic concepts apply as far as gameplay is concerned. Group of 5, tackle bosses/boss events with trash in between, get loot at the end. 
---
They ARE dungeons. In every sense of the word, except the actual word.
---
I'll upload and link you sometime this weekend
---
Not only is it a bad idea that would mean we'd have people running even worse builds it would also limit future elite specs.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The way it's set up now they could release a future Guardian Elite Spec that also uses an axe, but gives you completely different axe skills. There is no need to decide which set is the "default" and no need to handle how that default would conflict with someone not owning the defaults expansion. 
---
It would also cause issues and limit future elite specs whose weapon has strong ties to their elite spec mechanic.
---
The bleeds are stronger with Viper, and basically negligible in Sinister. However, the burns are stronger in Sinister due to more raw condition damage stat.
---
But that isn't burst. Power != Burst. If you have a boss that would phase every 4 sec and become invul/unable to target for a few, those classes that would be able to do good damage in that time window would be considered burst. In that case, power mesmer couldn't do good damage. Power is just power, burst is something completly different. Just as a burst heal is healing but alot of it at the same time.

Thank you man, I'll repost there ^^
---
Agree with this so much. I played minstrel Chrono for a long time til all the nerfs; it was easy mode. Switched to full diviner’s when it came out and realized how crappy I was at avoiding damage.
---
I also have a chrono and not stealing conjures :D
---
Please do.

Since people always ask: Yes, Nuuvem is on the approved vendor list.

fuck spoilers
---
Yeah it's great, but I'm hoping they can divert their gaze over to Mirage for just a second. The changes to EC actually look to be beneficial for Mirages too.
---
I 100% guarantee an expansion is being worked on but it probably required a lot more time to make it work
---
I personally think v is a brilliant place for dodge. At least with the way I hold my hand, I can comfortably use v to dodge and space to jump with my thumb.
---
Even WoodenPotatoes would say this is extreme over-analyzing.
---
can i use these codes on eu servers? it says content to be played only on US, but I've Rea somewhere that codes are universal and it won't matter?

That's a cheap infusion.

Wtf. I mean if it was mountain dew then cool.

OP really needs to use a different title next time, it reads like what an upset 14 year old would write and Im sure quite some people will downvote just for that without even reading the post...

From Arenanet's side: Yes. Absolutely. There are no conditions. Yes you may activate a code bought in EU in NA, or vise versa.
---
From the retailer sixe: Some retailera don't let you buy things from countries they don't operate in, for tax purposes mostly. **If you can buy the code it will work.**

I can still hear her laugh... :(
---
Can we stop using "political" as some kind of dirty-word?
---
*Everything* is tied up in "politics". There's no way around it. If you're trying to advocate for literally anything -- that is, if you are a human being who has opinions and believes in *anything at all*, then you are being "political". *Everyone* has an agenda. *Everyone* is trying to get their voice heard about what they love/want/believe in.
---
And what's wrong with that? How do people expect these things to happen, if not by raising awareness via charities, or rallies, or advertising, or any other thing that people use to bring attention to the issues that are important to them? The alternative is sitting down, shutting up, and watching your life pass by as nothing happens to change the things you believe should be changed.
---
If you want to support a cause, it's almost certainly going to be a political movement of some sort -- or tied up with one, at least. If you don't support the specific cause, then say so -- don't pretend that your distaste is because it's pushing politics on you.
---
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Thanos. I'm kind of like the leader in here. I'm made of balance, as all things should be. But don't let that intimidate you. You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of Gamora. Just a little father-daughter joke for you.
---
That is a nice notion, but WoW Cataclysm was a lesson to the entire industry. It takes the same amount of work to re-make the old as it would to make something brand new. As much as players talk about wanting devs to fix the old, the data says the opposite.
---
To be fair to the players, they really do want the old stuff to be fixed, they just (perhaps appropriately) think they deserve it. Like, it should just be this bonus thing that gets thrown in. Unfortunately, whether not a studio *should* do something is irrelevant if a business case for a strong RoI can't be made for it.
---
You selling any/all? I just found out these exist a few days ago and would love to own them but can't find them online anywhere.

Fortunately you'll be able to have fun again next year now that it's part of the new Annual Festival Rotation.

Maybe they'll finally make World 3 and 4 as a result of that, too.
---
idk about Djinn map that always felt small and zergy hopefully they can work on those factors as well. It's especially annoying with the center event for the lamp thing - a lot of newbies get distracted and go for it when really we could've needed them at the time is it just me that this happens to?
---
I'll get used to the LoS objects in Coliseum, after all, it was kinda heavily in favor of range spam pew pew'ing you off point. I still hope that things like shadow stepping to targets work via valid pathing. It's gonna be amusing dropping traps in any of the choke points instead of captain obvious on point style. Beware... the hedges.
---
I think I'm going to chuck a few on ebay this weekend. I'll let you know if I do!
---
Why can't it be both?
---
Why can't you empathize with all human beings, but also empathize with the specific struggles of specific groups of people (which are often different from your own struggles)?
---
The fact of the matter is, it's impossible to truly empathize with everyone *without* acknowledging the truth of their circumstances. If you try to say you actually care about everyone, but in the same breath dismiss their experience (which is inherently shaped by their race/gender/ethnicity/orientation/etc.), then you are lying to both them and to yourself. And this is the biggest lie that the low-key racists-who-swear-they-aren't-racist tell: that they actually value everyone equally, while simultaneously looking an entire group of people in the eye and saying "what you're saying about your experience is false, because I -- a person who isn't even in your group -- know you better than you know yourself".
---
If you're not willing to listen, then you're not empathizing with *anyone*.

Last year there was this huge Kung Fu tea promotion. It was actually the easiest and most and straightforward method to obtain one.

But right now your best odds are to pay attention to future streams and twitchs.
---
I was being a smart ass. I've got the FDS.
---
You can get it.. part of HoM
---
I wouldn't call it easy. Between the awful app, the lack of communication from anet and them changing the rules so only US players could obtain it, it was a fucking headache.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyv50R-AzUM
---
Oh I definitely understand. They did try a few changes and then decided they weren't worth it
---
Yeah, it's not perfect, but there's a lot of things that could improve the time, including some other small skips. 
---
The afk time gives me time to stretch the hands xD
---
I knew of a skip used in the w1z1 since last year (showed the record holder there) and then started experimenting with stuff when I got to w2z2 when doing a casual full clear. Just started to see if I could get past those spikes. I tested to see if I could get a wall jump and once that happened, I tried dodge jumping and it eventually worked. Showed some people participating in the sab speedrun competition and more areas were found as a result (I've got a few of the wall jump skips on my yt channel if you're curious).
---
I didn't find the one used in this run though.
---
Wall jumping is really only useful for these trib runs, but could essentially be found in many areas across the game though it would be kinda be pointless.
---
Registered sure, online and playing not so much lol
---
There have been times I've used mag shards to buy things.  More so early on in raiding, its been quite a long time since I've used mag shards to buy ascended.
---
Have my upvote. 100% agree with most things you've compiled for us.
---
I thought I was the only one who thought new dragon boi looked... off-putting(?) in some areas. I understand it's just a teaser trailer and part of me is genuinely hoping that the thing will be more polished upon release but if there's one thing that grinds my gears is that the body "rig" looks way too similar to that of the griffon; back legs + front legs so close together... cat-like. I can never get over Warclaw either. It's just chunky in all the wrong areas and that applies to Skyscale also.
---
I know, it's easy + cheap AF to use the same rig &amp; certain animations for a new mount but man what really blew me away with griffon and raptor etc is how unique they all look &amp; feel. I think you nailed the wording &amp; expression regarding being able to notice the 'weight' behind landing etc not being as evident in Skyscale.
---
I love seeing how anatomy works in slow-mo for visual references in drawing etc so little things like muscle movement + bounce back when landing makes these 3D models all the more appealing to the player.
---
Keep up the solid work, thanks for sharing with us.
---
Holy shit congrats
---
By itself it was a headache, but among all the available methods of obtention for this outfit, it was still the easiest and most accessible one nevertheless.
---
The expansions are end-game content meant for level 80 characters.  You don't have to buy them right now.  All of the QoL updates were applied game-wide regardless of who has what expansion.  I would say, though, if you can find them on sale from a decent retailer or website, definitely get them now.
---
OP, this is from 2014
---
Which makes it perfect since Thanos has no weapons.
---
I want an ascended greatsword.  Would it be better/cheaper/faster to go for Caladbolg, or craft it straight up?  It would be my first ascended weapon.
---
Thanks! Oh, I'm sure you will. ;-) Came close to getting a better time here too, but made mistakes near the end on those runs. I'd like to add some more optimal stuff/small skips in the run, but didn't have time, plus it makes the route even more fun...
---
Imagine if they replaced the tail with an Arrowhead's one.
---
You’re the hero that fantasy deserves, that isn’t sarcastic by the way, my least favorite thing in fantasy creature design is creatures that just feel like they don’t work, no matter how fantasy heavy something is, if you’re designing a living breathing animal, it should look like it works, even if it just works within the pre established rules of the setting, the skyscale just doesn’t do that, kudos.
---
How could OP prove my sarcasm?
---
Other redditors confirmed it in this thread earlier today:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ben9ct/can_you_buy_the_expansions_from_official_listed/
---
Raiding does take some focus to get the rewards though. Farming has a place because you'll always be able to just go farm and listen to a podcast or watch a video, versus finding nine other people
---
Cheapest would be caladbolg, fastest would be crafting it outright if you already have weaponsmithing at 500, and a decent middle ground would be getting the reaper specialization weapon collection done if you already have an 80 necromancer.
---
Cheaper is probably Caldabog, also potentially faster if you haven't been making timegated materials. For future reference there's [this list](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/ascended), though it's worth noting the price quoted for Caldabog assumes you're crafting everything (and not using the free stuff the first time quests give you.)
---
At first glance they still look like textures failed to load :/
---
&gt; GGG update their engine continuously.
---
So do Anet. We can see it ingame and we heared several statements about that. The whole SAB were broken for a long time cause of engine changing, gliding and other stuff came with HoT, they even changed the engine to be able to animate the legendary armors.
---
Congratulations \:D/
---
They called me a madman
---
Thanks.  I guess I’ll check in again in 6 months.
---
thanks man i'll go full zerk. Thank you for explaining this in such a concise way.
---
My wallet is too small for my $50s and my Diamond shoes are too tight!
---
They have good animations on the Asura too.
---
There's two reasons that you might want to pick up the expansions
---
1) if you're interested in the revenant profession, you can't play that without expansions
---
2) starting the first story chapter of both expansions gets you the glider (HoT) and the raptor mount (PoF), which can immensely help with movement. Note, both story chapters are level 80, so you'll probably need someone to help you out if you choose to do this
---
Other than that, everything expansion related is for level 80 after you've gotten a hang of the gameplay and your profession.
---
That might get more players running them, but that wouldn't make me like them, and I think would just scootch the time-frame of how long someone plays them, gets their desired reward, and moves on.
---
I did a route of cadecus manor recently just for completion that it was fucking atrocious.  I am never setting foot in that dungeon again if I can avoid it.
---
I keep playing fractals because I actually have fun doing them.
---
I don't see a reason for this. I mean Anet said they don't plan to update the engine, because the performance win would be too little. So the main reason (I think) -&gt; performance isn't there. 
---
I think the whole Engine topic is only because of the misinterpretation of "Anet uses a heavy modified GW1 engine for GW2". Without any clue of what "heavy modified" actually is, people start to mostly ignore this part and equalize the GW2 engine with the GW1 engine. And also taking this to bring senseless arguments like "the engine is way to old" etc. 
---
We actually don't know what these heavy modifications were, but we can see ingame that it's more a "based on GW1 engine" than a "modified GW1 engine". 
---
In GW1 we weren't even able to jump, a map contained up to 8 players, the largest ones up to 12 in PvE and 24 in PvP, most areas of the maps were inaccessible, we only hat certain ways and some flat areas. In GW2 we don't only can jump, we can glide, fly, dive, swim (summarizes we have physics), we can fight underwater, the whole fight system is way more dynamic, we have mounts, we have platforms that thrust us to certain points, we have animated armors and weapons, the maps are way bigger, all areas are accessible and each map contain ~80-150 players, the largest maps (WvW maps) contain up to 500 players. 
---
So we see these modifications are huges, so huge that both engines aren't comparabe anymore.
---
Oh and my username thingy is Toxic Robbie.5807, if anyone wants to add \~
---
Neither do adults.
---
Tbh if arena plans expansion after season 5 It IS in development atm.
---
the shield actually looks really good imo
---
The problem is people who did dungeons did enjoy dungeons, they were just small in number as a percentage of the playerbase. I had a few people in my guild who ran dungeons regularly. Those same people who didn't run dungeons don't run fractals either. That's the issue.
---
They're not running dungeons because they're buggy. They're not running dungeons because they're casual as fuck, solo players, or don't want to involve themselves in an organized group to be judged. Some are just shy. At any rate, most people who don't do dungeons wouldn't likely do them if they fixed them either.
---
Ah, I see they saved the 'best' till last... my poor eyes.
---
Some years ago (before the crimson assassin skins were released) I had to choose as well. I took the pistol as it compliments nicely with incinerator. Next thing I would google the different sounds of the SAB weapons, as every warhorn has a different unique sound. If you like it, than take that on. Other good skins are the shield, GS, sword, dagger, staff and axe. Bows are ok as well.
---
I certainly appreciate the effort you put into this! However, I'm in the boat that we should see what comes with the full release before making some of the judgments you made.
---
I will admit, though, you're right that the concept art for the various dragons makes me a bit sad they didn't go with a more illustrious, flowing style of dragon. I guess we'll have to see what they do with skins. I would never have guessed a skimmer could be made into a humming bird, so maybe there's hope.
---
Triddy &lt;3
---
If Desolation is analogous to Tangled Depths, I'm starting to see why people call me insane for liking TD, lmao. Not gonna lie, the maps are growing on me though. Similar to TD, Deso has the most areas where I can spontaneously kill people :']
---
Not quite. With PoF's release, they updated Sohothin's model so now it's different from the Fiery Dragon Sword model from the HoM. The main difference is that the head looks closer to Zhaitan's (if Zhaitan had a jaw), with horns that curl backwards.
---
Hi, I have been doing Raid/Fractal/CM for more than a month with different Condi Firebrand build.
---
General observation, reaching 100% Burn duration is really important even in Fractal. Your burn duration is short enough that even doubling it keep it short and effective during burst. You could reach highest spike damage in around 15sec when DH reach in around 10sec. Tradition condition build reach highest damage in around 20 to 40 seconds.
---
Grieving =&gt; Power damage help a bit for the spike but nothing significant because condition damage is around 80% to 90%. If you use scepter a lot, grieving help but if you camp axe the gain is nearly visible.
---
Sinister =&gt; This one try to maximize burning damage. On fight where you cleave multiple ennemies and refresh F1 (bosses with ads or trash mobs), this build really skyrocket.
---
Viper =&gt; Similar to Grieving but your spike damage is a bit longer because you rely on bleeding a bit.
---
By playing a lots of Firebrand, I found that those build has an amazing carry potential and versatility, but some gear combo lock you more or less from them. The best gear combo I found is a fourth option; Plaguedoctor or Seraph. I found Seraph less interesting because you gain pretty much nothing from crits. Plaguedoctor will increase your health to 25k with Balthazar runes. With this health you gain survivability to get your ally out of problem.
---
Plaguedoctor with Balthazar =&gt; This gear set open up all the possibility without sacrificing to much Dps. You will have the same condition damage has Viper and 100% Burn duration. Bleed is worth ~5% of your total damage in full Viper. So IMO its worth sacrificing some of it and you will not have the traits in Quickbrand that bleed with Axe anyway. You will lose some power damage too, but again when 5% to 10% of your damage come from direct damage. Sacrificing ~1100 Power and ~600 Precision will not affect a lot of your damage. Over all you lower your theoric damage by ~10% but in really its harder to say due to how F1 refresh and proc in fight. In fight with a lot of ads, your damage lost will be lower. But on a single boss you will ~10%  With this sacrifice you gain ~40% Boon Duration compare to 10% Boon Duration (40% for Quickness) for viper. This 30% Boons Duration might not be a lot but it can make the difference. Fury, Might, Protection, Aegis, Stability are all increase and help keeping uptime. F3 tomes will give you over 30sec protection with the right traits. The Healing Power is an other nice have. Group need spike heal you are there with 40sec Cooldown(32sec with 100% Alacrity) that isn't to long. Did I already say that this build have 25k Hp compare to 10k for the others... You have no idea how usefull having 25k Hp could be. Someone down in aoe ticking 5k/sec damage, no problem I can stay in it for 5 secs. This even give you the possibility to give Aegis with heal mantra to someone that need it without keeping it for you. You could swap Virtue traits for Honor if more support is needed. You could swap scepter for mace or staff too if needed. This give you the possibility to be Buffer/Half-Healer/Dps.
---
IMO the possibility to carry your group and adapt is higher with this build. Personnaly if someone ask me what's build I should make for Firebrand and I just want one Ascended armor, I will show them this Plaguedoctor Firebrand build.
---
Bro I’m one of the regulars there
---
That is actually really good! The armor is basically spot on.
---
If you're thinking about raiding, you really can't be using rabid because toughness could throw off the tanking mechanics in probably around half of fights. Beyond that, you can do pretty much anything in open world and WvW, and there are more casual fractal groups that don't mind if you're not running a 100% optimal meta build. 
---
That said, I can't offer any specific details about how much better viper is on mirage since I don't play it ha.
---
Expertise is a damage **multiplier**, it's very important. Without any expertise, you're doing half the total condi damage you should be doing. Half damage is a huge difference.
---
Wow this is pretty amazing.
---
Decided to vent some frustration on struggling with Deimos this week by turning it into a little silly video. Enjoy.
---
I made my first Warrior recently and the Asuran animations definitely add extra fun to the physical skills.
---
It was too favorable to long range spam, like longbow rangers or rifle deadeyes. Often there is no way to hide when you’re doing simple like capping a point or rotating. 
---
The change is long overdue imo.
---
Wow, who made this... taking it's fan made and that is quite a considerable effort!
---
If you're able to recover your old account you'll get birthday gifts on all old characters and you'll have an account that doesn't have any free to play restrictions. The expansions are mainly level 80 content and you'll need a level 80 character to do them (though you can unlock a mount at any level with the help of a friend if you like, I'd offer if you want). So it's up to you if you want to hold off on them or get them now, personally they are a huge amount of content and definitely worth it if you plan to play the game after level 80. There isn't really a "complete the first map" type of thing but you could finish the full personal story and optionally the season 2 story before moving on the the expansions in order. The story line goes: personal story &gt; season 1 (no longer playable) &gt; season 2 (gem store) &gt; Heart of Thorns (expansion 1) &gt; Season 3 (gem store) &gt; Path of Fire (Expansion 2) &gt; Season 4 (current season, current episode number 5 is active and unlocked for free with login and episode 4 is on the gem store for free the next few days) &gt; Season 5 (next living story season, not out yet). I did write up a [shortened story recap here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Story_Recap) if you want to go over missed content (I'd suggest doing personal story first then reading or watching season 1). 
---
As for the DLCs themselves I always recommend [DLGamer](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911) since they have a constant sale of some kind going on and right now the pack is 37% off. If you wanted to wait the expansions both go on 50% off sales pretty often but it's only a difference of ~$8.
---
Peak shitposting
---
That is really impressive.

Can someone tell what exactly im looking at?
---
People who pay for skins don't care about balance or bugs. And skins is the only reason for these mounts to exist :)
---
Something [like this](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Power_Greatsword) with greatsword / longbow would work. I mained soulbeast with many similar builds for a long time, feel free to ask questions on builds or gearing.
---
The amount of time he put into the clockwork DR must have been insane.  It felt like he just rushed the other homelands, but I did appreciate the Gypsy Danger-like Black Citadel.
---
That font.
---
This needs more upvotes!
---
Where did you get the picture? I'm sure the content creator would like a little credit. :)
---
DR was mind-blowing; the rest was sadly just amazing.
---
Note that dT build has not been totally updated to the latest Repaer changes and in Soul Reaping you should take [Soul Barbs](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Soul_Barbs) as Master trait for better DPS and burst potential.
---
[SC build page](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/reaper/power/) (website more dedicated to raids) is currently a bit better for this build and a good idea of the current rotation but dT will give you more fractal specific situational advice.
---
Game of thrones intro made to look like GW2
---
Btw dT website is not 100% up to date on this build as they do not use Soul Barbs in Soul Reaping.
---
I mean if they've implemented longterm goals like Fractal God I don't see why people having hundreds of ascended boxes is such a far and inconceivable reality. OP bringing up this problem isn't a humblebrag, it's just a minor QoL suggestion that rings true for a lot of us. It's not a manufactured issue; it's a natural consequence of people playing the game consistently over years.
---
Like I'm not grabbing pitchforks saying this must be implemented or anything; I can live with bank tabs full of ascended boxes. There are probably more pressing issues. But I don't know why OP making the suggestion alone merits so much backlash from you.
---
I think the rotation has slightly changed too because of Soul Barbs. Before your clue to exit shroud was roughly the 50% shroud mark while being close to being able to weapon swap and now it's when the Soul Barbs buff is about to expire. Fortunately I think it changes the time you exit shroud by like 1 Shroud AA chain or something like that (in ideal conditions).
---
Your first Caladbolg is essentially free since the achievements give the things you need.
---
lol op complaining about the realism of dragon's anatomy
---
Naw but will be awesome wolverine tho xD
---
This is so awesome ...
---
What game are you playing that mirage is still a problem
---
I agree with comm, dont sac. You're wasting too many dodges on nothing.
---
Game of Wars 2
---
lol ranged strat.. people are really bad
---
Really impressive but it’s too dragged out imo, comparing it to Skyrim’s GoT intro which is a lot cleaner. Either way, well done!
---
That might be because there are a bit less parts to fiddle with except maybe for Hoelbrak.
---
Holy shit
---
**THANOS CAR**
---
*(insert Thanos car here)*
---
With this embrassing issue he lost his face.
---
I think you should repair your client.
---
Nice work! Any links for downloads?
---
Dayum, DR was insane.
---
&gt; There are some for terminator, Pokemon, and GoT as well. They're pretty funny and I would like to collect them here with you.
---
So why dont you post them?
---
Farm the Tp
---
my characters lost their faces in character select menu yesterday, but no crashes happened
---
Your mom is ugly.
---
just use google drive or something :)
---
Careful with the sword.  I broke mine off years ago when i bumped into it.  It broke off at the hilt so i could probably just glue it back on, but i never bothered.  Haha.
---
DR and Hoelbrak looked the best, rest was meh sadly but still nice effort
---
Dungeons were run every day often, there were loads of LFGs and speedruns. as soon as they lowered the gold people stopped doing dungeons as frequently.
---
people would still be running them today if the gold was still at old rates I guess?
---
nothing more adorable than seeing a huge great norn on an ickle bunny rabbit though! :)
---
So, I have no idea how this exactly works....all I can say is that it works PHENOMENALLY!! I have an i7-8700k with a GTX 1080Ti and the performance boost is HUGE. My framerates previously had very wide variations and stutters depending on the area in which I was playing. Now, that variation and stutter is almost COMPLETELY nonexistent, no matter which map I choose. I am forever in the debt of the creator of this addon. This is probably the BEST thing that has ever been introduced into GW2. (P.S. I also used this wrapper with Arcdps and buildtemplates and it still works perfectly.) 
---
All in all, I could not be happier that I decided to try out this addon!!
---
I wish he hadn't, it drags
---
he just chillin there with half the chickens
---
Your best bet is to do a full clear and stay after the end and explore to your heart's content. That's what I did to see all of Twilight Arbor.
---
Giving us 1 or 2 elite specs every patch doesn't seem all that unrealistic. 
---
In terms of voice acting and animation work, they already do a ton of that in each episode, so that's not an issue. The only issue would maybe be balance, but that seems like a lame excuse to hold back such impactful gameplay additions. They could even tie them into the story and flesh out the lore of them even more than they did with PoF specs.
---
Gains would be huge going for viper. Playing through HoT will give you a few exotic pieces of it and the trinkets are easily farmer in Bitterfrost Frontier. Might help you get a good head start doing that!
---
It’s not that but in DR there are so many parts that’s working, while in the other cities there’s not much in comparison
---
I tawt I taw a puddy tat!
---
I think that it would be best to make it just DR because it was simply amazing and perhaps it could be fit into the timeframe of a single song length. 
---
Still, that is an incredible piece of work and I had my jaw on the ground during the DR sequence.
---
When you just want the hp and you carefully dps it down to not agro anything then the stupid djinn dashes and agros everything within a 5 mile radius. The real hp is the fauna and the forge patrol that seems to be there whenever you do the hp.
---
There's another in ER with the awakened general. Oh you wanted the hp? Nope. Scarabs. Nope. SANDSHARKS and one earth djinn.
---
This may sound like something strange to you, but you aren't 90% of the population of anything.
---
We all'be been killed by that fire Hyrda before :P
---
I can't seem to 1v1 mesmers, engineer or necromancer and 4 out of 5 times their team only has these professions. Not gonna lie I'm pretty bad.
---
The real hero point is the fire hydra + sand lion wombo combo.
---
The shield is amazing but i prefer it for things like cuphead/ori and the blind forest/hollow knight etc. Everything thats better with a Controller :) for gw2 its also ok but i prefer my usual Desktop setup. For Coop SAB it was nice though ;)
---
&gt;Fewer paths, different reward structure, and more polish.
---
so fractals?
---
I'll just leave the wow definition i found. 
---
&gt;Burst damage is a term used to describe dealing high amounts of damage in a very short period of time.
---
Just like Anet.
---
Nah, on the other cities he basically showed the "finished" city with one or two things building itself. The Black Citadel could be shown constructing itself from scratch, The Grove could be shown growing, and in Rata Sum there is a lot of glowing Asura Tech that could be built, but even the portals were already there and just shown on "camera". That being said, the entire animation was a real drag. In the GoT intro everything builds up way quicker.
---
Yeah, good for the animator for having the skill to do this in the first place, but, if looking at it from a critical eye: way too much time was spent on each city (especially DR)--and only the starter cities, at that.  
---
For a longer term goal for the animation (if trying to reflect how the GoT intro is), the pacing for each city would need to be sped up immensely, and the other cities on the map should be explored too. LA and Ebonhawke come to mind first, but others like Vigil Keep, the Priory, Tarir, and Amnoon would also be awesome to see.
---
Aurene replacing Zhaithan confirmed
---
look how few and far between raid releases are though, especially considering they only really make new gemstore outfits, a couple hours of LW and *maybe* a fractal every couple of months. it appears as if they are just lazy in addition to being mismanaged.
---
Take more offensive weapons and traits. Staff and glyphs do nothing when it comes to damage. GS and offhand axe are your main damaging tools (or shortbow and torch if you play condi).
---
The only thing you can do is change how condition numbers appear.
---
Seriously, all I see is just the obsession with semantics. Fractal, in every freaking way, is pretty much a dungeon. Story, checked. Gear drops, checked. Reward tokens, checked. Difficulty level, checked. Group content, checked. 
---
The only thing they need to expand is the length and stort, which, by the look of it obviously shows that the length of fractal is pretty much what anet wants to go with in term of instanced group dungeon.
---
Arguing about the "wholeness" of fractal's features is one thing but it is still a dungeon.
---
Some people need to get the fuck over it and argue the actual problem that is the depth of fractals not whether it's callced dungeon or not.
---
THIS IS INCREDIBLEEEEE. 
---
Major fan of GOT and GW2 here and as a designer I always love looking at ending and opening credits. Great work there!!
---
I don't really know what to say. Either you can't read English, or you're being disingenuous. I think I know which it is, though.
---
O.o Tovargent who used it in his speedrun just said its patched so never bothered to try it myself
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
&gt;Moral of the story, don't be a bully
---
Ever. No matter the reason.
---
For something like this, it's probably either because the person who made it started with dr and thought it would be cool to do others as well or the good old "first impressions are what counts" what a lot of "triple A" games go for with their intros and trailers.
---
My guess would be the first though.
---
You have to do get up in the checkpoint to the wooden part at the right side and then do a really hard dodgejump (previously a simple jump was enough) but still doable.
---
Press enter instead
---
Oh sht cool. Ill use that next year
---
You don't know what to say because you don't have a leg to stand on. The loud, proud association with extremist ideology is right there on their website for all to see.
---
&gt; the information from the wiki is more convenient and understandable for player
---
I agree.
---
so you didn't want to look at guides and manuals, so you looked at the wiki's guide and manual to compile your own guide and manual :')
---
anyway, welcome to the game. glad you already found something you can work towards.
---
Yeah till the sales for "gw2 "come up...u could do that.
---
Well, there's GW2Efficiency for recipe/crafting breakdown.
---
Amazing job! If you would be improve the sound it would be perfect. The way that the music stops and starts again and the ups and downs in volume need some work. But overall, I am impressed!
---
That fucking hydra.
---
A full rewrite of dungeons isn't going to happen, and at the same time Anet isn't going to scrap dungeons. We can leave the system alone (dead, broken, unused), or we can find a low effort fix that Anet can use to make dungeons relevant 6 years later.
---
As far as running cetain dungeons, we do have [Tyrian exchange Vouchers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tyrian_Exchange_Voucher) that address this.  A system to convert tokens from a path you like running into (fewer) tokens of a path you just don't enjoy would be very welcome.
---
Finally on the subject of hating dungeons, that's totally fine!  You aren't expected to love every fwscet of endgame, which is why we have so many options!  This update might not be for you.  It's for the people like me that do enjoy dungeons and fractals, but who find themselves unable to or unrewarded for doing so.
---
The idea was always supposed to be "I want to run dungeons today" or "I hate running dungeons," not "dungeons are a waste of my time."
---
We copy builds from SC and MB too.
---
i whoud rather see some usage for Ball of Dark Energy,that whoud solve all issues with surplus of asc shit you geting.
---
How close are you gear and build wise to this [openworld trapper druid](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Druid_-_Condi_Trapper) or this [meta raid version](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/druid/condition/)? Obviously that second build is designed as a support so if you don't have allies you'd need to swap skills and traits. Mainly it will come down to actually using a damaging weapon with damaging skills and gear. 
---
There is an option in the settings for simple condition floaters but honestly it makes it more obnoxious for me since you then get a bunch of white numbers instead of the condition icons but feel free to try that and see if it works for you. Can also try turning down the skill LoD and some of the particle effects in graphics settings if you have too much on screen.
---
They're evolving! D:
---
Mate it’s a video game. Nobody’s gonna shank u if u fucking report them lmao. If u want problems to be solved then go to someone who can solve them, and u should’ve reported the harasser to anet who can solve ur problem. It’s simple logic it’s not that difficult. And as for your little analogy, are you saying you’re a criminal, and in this case a toxic person as well? Maybe you should just try not to be toxic then dumbass.
---
Snatched-looking character though.
---
There is some extra bits of performance if you want/able to make a custom config. Ask on discord if you are need it.
---
"elder dragon 'dragon'" or not, it's still a fictional creature, of which we do not even know the origin - for all we know they are just another spawn of kralkatorrik - as such we can not even reasonably speculate about potential evolutionary backstory that would cause limbs to develop one way or another.
---
and yes, he is using a gemstore skin in his comparison, it might be a simple one, but it's a gemstore skin nonetheless, easily identified by the pattern, and the fact that parts that are undyeable on the default skin are dyed. and as the skyscale image to my knowledge stems from a low res twitter video, i won't judge the detail presented in it, as twitter video compression tends to be unflattering to the subject.
---
I also noticed that the lens at the beginning is supposed to zoom in onto the "battle plan" but here it's just unneeded epilepsy
---
Nice the flat designs
---
While i will agree with mirave balance i disagree with your other points.
---
Unblockable effect is very short on ranger so dodge the initial burst where its up and then you just need reflects or projectile absorbtion which there is plenty of in the current meta. And their damage is far from oneshot.
---
The pets knock-down and skills have wind ups and animations which sre visible, in a sustained fight they might seem random but you can see when its being cast for the most part. 
---
Scrapper is still a really good bruiser but you just have to wait for the barrier burst to wear off and then burst them, they are really easy to play but also easy to outplay.
---
Herald is indeed very strong in terms of sustained and burst damage, and they have access to a lot of mitigation, but they crumble to condi pressure or hard bursts.
---
Edit: sorry for bad spelling, i am on mobile
---
He probably believes in Dragons irl, most likely he is a Flat-Earther and Anti-Vax aswell.
---
Dragons don't exist irl, there is no anatomy bound to them. Quit your Bullshit.
---
Yeah. One thing that dungeons do better, is how engaged and related they are to story. In the mists however, they put whatever comes out of their head. I am not saying that it's not cool to relive the charr invasion of Ascalon, but it's a pity to not also have new dungeons that have a place in the world and the story.
---
They do have legs. They're tucked up underneath.
---
I love watching them play their own game. Kind of like it's actually meant to be played, not how jaded veterans make it look.
---
Getting some Alice in Wonderland vibes here. Tastefully done, though I think the right kind of face mask would make it even better.
---
Fair mistake to make.
---
How can I effectively farm gold? I want to get into raiding and I am unwilling to delete a charecter and need another slot
---
&gt;  I still have no idea how to get viper gear
---
Buy the insignia recipe in Auric Basin, craft exotic or ascended using recipes looted in Auric Basin.
---
Which GPU do dou own and how are your framerates?
---
I'm on the verge to buy a 21:9 Monitor, but I'm also afraid of low framerates :(
---
can you please direct me to where i said at any point during my writing that people aren't allowed to enjoy the skyscale or be excited for it? i'd really appreciate that
---
Gotta try this next year
---
They are so ridiculously strong
---
I agree. Bunch of wannabes.
---
LOL no I am not wrong you failed spectacularly in reading my comment.
---
A lot of people seem to be saying this which is very confusing to me because if I was asking for realism I would have demanded that all mounts be removed immediately, since none of them exist in the real world. I praised the griffon and raptor for their awesome fantasy designs. Understanding how far one can stretch the suspension of disbelief and how to extend that reach through use of understanding of real life animal anatomy is an important part of creature design, one that Arenanet is really really good at.
---
I am very glad that they got ammo.
---
I wanted ammo-style recharges for GW2 since release, and the way the improve physical skills is a testament on how well ammo skills work.
---
Thanks to ammo recharges, you can throw a few kicks in a row, while still being unable to keep spamming them indefinitely. This allows improving the individual power of the skill without making it overpowered.
---
PoF would've been improved a year go if they cared. They simply don't.
---
Charr. The Charr seem to do more elemental based magic then the other races. The Flame legion is all about fire. The recently introduced Olmakhan use a lot of earth and lightning magic.
---
Seconding the shield being amazing. I only have the OG tablet, but it's my go to device when I need something larger than my phone (that happens less and less as they get bigger).
---
It is - or was, when I still played - common parlance in EVE Online. That's where I picked it up.
---
Note: Are you sure you want to mail Gift From Scarlet to Samarog?
---
I am absolutely open to suggestions on that because I honestly have no clue what would be appropriate.

---
Cheap Rabid gear on the TP
---
This is correct however, we’re not really sure yet whether you will need PoF for LWS5 (which isn’t out yet).
---
Actually, the Earth Djinn is considered the hardest bounty in the game, wiping most of the groups who attempt it.
---
Source: ANET yearly statistics.
---
I love all the people arguing against this because they don’t play enough to collect ascended gear out the ass. It’s a very simple change that won’t effect you in the slightest, guy’s. There’s no need to give a counter point.
---
Sadly, you can tell from the trailer that they are AGAIN reusing the griffon animation skeleton/rig (after already reusing it for the warclaw). Really disappointing and indicative of a "that's good enough" work mentality.
---
I really regretted not getting it when the game came out, so when I saw one for a decent price I snatched it up real good! Got a physical copy of HoT the other week for $10 CAD too. Time to build up the GW2 goodies!
---
Interesting idea. Can't commit to it personally but just wanted to say you might wanna include info on whether it's EU or NA server (unless I missed it in the post somewhere)
---
The jump at 1:30 isnt as easy as the OP made it look, they have practiced that jump a good few times, it also looks like some of these jumps require glitches in the terrain to actually catch you, but having not done it, and we cant test it atm, 
---
If the jumps can be easily done, this is a good path for people who struggle with Trib mode.
---
Thank you, I saved this.
---
I look forward to making all of my charr scantily-clad.
---
I don't understand the down votes here and furthermore am thankful that you asked this question, as now I have saved the valuable list that someone responded with. Thanks.
---
Rev single handedly drives the current meta. It needs major nerfs. 
---
Additionally when played well, rev will never die.
---
The dungeons were only added very late in development, meaning the boss mechanics and attacks were very poorly tuned to the combat system and there were bugs and skips everywhere. 
---
Meaning that the only way to really enjoy dungeons is to break them even further making speedrun the default way to play them.
---
Also the whole 'no/flexible class roles' design philosophy they had pretty harshly limited the mechanical depth that they could have in the fights.
---
Additionally the main reward from dungeons was exotic gear which was quickly obsoleted when they added ascended gear because exotic was too easy to get.
---
This thread: Charr shouldn’t be elementalists lore-wise! ESPECIALLY not Iron Legion or Blood Legion!
---
Me, sitting on my Iron Legion Charr elementalist: Whoops.
---
Seriously though, it all depends on what kind of story you want to tell. A human with a knack for fire so strong that the priests of Balthazar see them as blessed by the War God himself? A norn who feels the strength of their affiliated Spirit in the wind and ice they command? A charr of earth and fire, who wants to prove their place in their warband and finds kinship in fellow elementalist Euryale? It really depends on what speaks to you the most.
---
WHAT, WHY WAS I NOT INFORMED OF THIS.
---
flower hair
---
&gt;If a naked person is immersion ruining, but angel-winged Charr with enough glowy bullshit to rival the sun *isn't*
---
I'M SORRY! I just want to get focused in WvW, stop judging me!
---
All races make sense, since Tyria is littered/overflowing with magic. Every class is using it lorewise.
---
Their motivation/view of magic differs though:
---
* For humans it's a power given to them by the gods (or it has been often seen as that), maybe casting is a way of worship for them. They will use whatever is given to them to survive in this world, so magic is also a means to that.
---
* Sylvari are themselves a race formed by magic, it's a "new" or "other" way for them to experience and interact with a world they know yet so little of
---
* Norn see it as a way to greater things - in honor of their strength story and legend as well as to honor the spirits with. They are an ancient race in Tyria, said to have dwelled among the earlier great magic users in the age of giants (Jotun, Lupicus being examples of that)
---
* Asura have a natural affinity to magic, use it for almost everything, even worship the flow of magic in Tyria as the eternal alchemy. As a highly intelligent race their spellcasters have high proficiency, use it for their way in life (academics/research/their societal duties)
---
* Charr see magic as a tool, and a tool of war in that. Elementalists might have it a bit difficult to shake the association with the flame legion, but in their upbringing, their time in their farahr they'll be taught how to use spells to the benefit of their warband. A tool must be mastered, espcially when used in war, so they'll be able to weild it well.
---
The Bittervets only want a game. Gw2 sometimes is not a game, is a cinematic novel. Last episode you cannot die literally. I get that sometimes not dying serves the narrative more than it serves gameplay and immersion, but that has been the trend for a long time now. 80% of the content put out in this game is unfailable. 
---
We Bittervets care about this game and we are affraid of bleeding people out because there is no challenge anywhere. I enjoy easy content because it has quality but I beat it in 2-3 hours then I'm done. Hard content lasts way longer.
---
And just to add to the raid thing, if you join traning groups you will most of the environments are actually really friendly.
---
you bought an account or sealed game?
---
oh, look, suddenly the difference isn't all that prominent anymore.
---
The jump has been around since 2018 shown by Grimjacke iirc. I tried it this year and the only trick behind it is to jump when you think it’s too late. Also if you fail the jump, getting back to it takes 5seconds. OP took a longer path then the known tho which consists of arc jumps that are tricky to pull off. I’d use that path to just skip the Ravine (checkpoint 2 to 3) and the gap (checkpoint 3 to 4).
---
&gt; Arenanet tracks data showing exactly how players interact with the game and exactly which content is actually being played.
---
ArenaNet is also awful at interpreting data.
---
They "officially" gave up on dungeons after Twilight Arbor Aetherpath, which was severely underplayed.
---
Players don't play it? They must not like it then. They didn't even stop to think of the reasons why, the totally awful shitty loot being the biggest of them, which wasn't addressed until many years later.
---
This was back when the world boss train was at its most profitable time, so do your math. No one played the new dungeon because loot was garbage, and afking at the svanir shaman wasn't only easier, but more profitable as well.
---
It's good analysis, but they might have fixed a good amount of the issues by the time it releases. Last minute tweaks are by no means out of the question, same with post-release updates/fixes to the animations.
---
That was beautifully explained. Another sidenote would be, that humans play the role of elves in GW2. Vast, magically-inclined race that fell prey to its own decadence and now fights for survival against industrial upstart nations.
---
Personally, while I agree that we should have a wide open map, something about it really feels low quality. Like if someone told you that this was a fan's first attempt at making a PvP stage, you'd probably believe them. It looks like really basic assets plopped in a big field. I don't know if killing the sight lines is the thing that needed to happen, but it certainly looks like a more professional map from what I see.
---
Spending tons and tons of resources into new systems to then abandon then after a few weeks.
---
They have a great problem with their design philosophy.
---
I often make and delete chars to try other classes  and professions when ever I do this HP I just clear everything around, lions, forged or of course Hydras, I died the first time I did it tho
---
10/10 would hang out in thorny bushes again.
---
Dont get me wrong, im not disputing the jump or when it was found, but when i first seen it done, i tried it, and people like yourself who have mastered it, make it look super easy, my comment was more for the people who think ohhh easy mode.
---
The ravine is by far the worst part of W1Z1, i had so many sync issues with that part this year, like the blocks jumping before i was near them, or me landing and then the game deciding no way and then suddenly slamming be off the edge.
---
You know I -still- haven't seen that movie, and I have been telling myself for ages I need to.
---
I should really go watch it.
---
pink eyes
---
Well nevermind then. Been a while.
---
Ah no worries I only wanted to provide a bit info about the skip. Yes it’s a godsend for high ping when trying the ravine. Had to find that out the hard way last year and only figured out this year that there’s a skip.
---
Daddy Rytlock
---
I think if he just did everything simultaneously instead of in series, it would have cut a lot of time. It is awesome the way DR is, but I kind of felt the others were more of a fly-by. Whereas if you just had all the stuff in DR going at once, and just focused on cool things but you can see the others in the background, it would've been a shorter clip. But yeah. To emphasize your point. Pacing.
---
In my experience, my Asura Tempest is definitely the best fit with his focus on Air overload and his story involvement with the Weather machine invention.
---
If you aim for weaver, do note that the profession originated in Elona with [this human](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Acolyte_Sousuke) studying the djinn.
---
No, EVE just takes a very long time to play.
---
thanks for the detailed feedback, i really appreciate! the last picture was absolutely meant to be taken as a joke, hence why it is after everything else. i am aware that the 'spines' on the neck of the skyscale are simply modified scales, much like the raptor possesses.
---
as for your horned lizard, you aren't quite correct in your mapping, which is totally understandable because that image is pretty confusing because of weird perspective. [here's my own mapping](https://i.imgur.com/QYAL6vA.jpg) plus a few other horned lizard examples to round it out. my point wasn't that reptiles can't have a singular row of central spines - they absolutely can, and you need look no further than any [iguana](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_original/bzqzpft0koq18kvn6b0h.jpg) to confirm this - but rather that all reptiles' scales follow some form of pattern. (you can read papers on this but honestly unless you're actually into reptiles it's pretty boring, and i know i'm not) the singular ridge just seemed arbitrary and out of place to me, which is why i described it as annoying.
---
I do hope you're right about the teaser being an in production sample
---
for the griffons movement during straight flight, that's an intended animation and it's easy to tell it is. the jittering on the skyscale would not be. i don't believe you can honestly tell me you think [this](https://i.imgur.com/bsMw3UK.mp4) is equivalent to [this](https://i.imgur.com/6O6JHyj.gif).
---
i also don't expect them to try and correct every thing i mentioned, or even any single thing i mentioned. arenanet are an accomplished and experienced game studio that have proved time and time again they are capable of producing beautiful and enjoyable content. i wrote this as a fan and because i love guild wars 2, and expecting anyone to take it as anything other than fan content is silly.
---
with regards to the elder dragons, i always viewed them as a physical amalgamation of facet of pure magical energy, an ethereal being brought into existence only to consume, unbound by silly things like practicality and evolutionary theory
---
&gt; the people who care and enjoy some challenge get shitted on.
---
The people who care and enjoy some challenge have raids and high-tier fractals/CMs. They're also massively outweighed by the number of people who aren't into that. ArenaNet needs to make money; where's the most effective place to spend their development budget? Is it on the extreme minority, or is it on the majority?
---
Riba doesnt have 100% uptime I check for it all the time
---
Fire Hydra be like :
---
#AYO WASSUP HOMIES :D
---
It starts fitting especially if you use the decadent fancy elves instead of the naturalistic hippy elves. The kind of elves that live in gigantic cities of white stone, are obsessed with their own nobility and spend most of their time backstabbing each other on court while jerking themselves over their own superiority and magical prowess.
---
That's humans in GW2.
---
And then, bam, the elven kingdoms start to fall.
---
&gt;Look at me, I don't know what a hyperbole is
---
There is no debate to be had that the player count in PvP has been in constant decline since PoF. We don't have the stats to track the exact number but 90% is probably not too far off.
---
Good to know

Dredge weapons. To acquire them, you have to increase steel production.
---
Hodgins in Ascalonian Catacombs P1 makes an offhand remark about how Ascalonians preferred fire magics. GW1 elementalists can attest to how true that is.
---
In the Crystal Oasis just outside the Amnoon refugee camp you can see a Warthog, a meerkat, and a Lion ki-err, i mean lion cub crossing the road.
---
Timegated materials are usually ascended craftable materials; usually the main components of finished ascended gear. The material itself will advertise whether or not it's a timegated material at the bottom of the crafting screen.
---
Otherwise, map specific nodes (think bitterfrost berries on the Bitterfrost Frontier map) are timegated in that you can only gather a certain amount per day.
---
As far as home instance gathering, most of the LS3 maps have a home instance node for each unique material that you can earn by spending time on its respective map. They may be tied behind an achievement, or are purchasable from a vendor on the map. For more common nodes, you can usually buy them on the TP, but they may be expensive.

---
One can hope for a Charr homlands expac sometime with a focus on Charr story progression. The Olmakhan are already shamanic and not flamelegion indoctrinated/titan worshipping. But as Charr are one of the least played races... who knows. :)
---
"New, Sealed" game.  No code inside.  Seller changed their ad description *after* I had bought it and now it says "disc only, no codes."  But ebay archives ads when they change, which I didn't know before yesterday so I have proof.  I've already initiated the refund and mailed the package back to the seller.
---
When I get home, I'll buy it legitimately. :)
---
These ads are based on cookies and your facebook history. So they actually advertise you the game you're already playing.
---
I have never, across over 10 characters and helping random people get that Hero Challenge, *ever* fought this Djinn **without** the Fire Hydra showing up. The Sand Lions, the Sand Sharks, and the Forged Patrol aren't always there, but the Fire Hydra never passes up a party (wipe)
---
No to everything you wrote. Just no.
---
It's really weird how excited GW2 fans are to see traditional advertisements for this game.
---
I think it has a lot to do with how a lot of Anet's previous approach to advertising was... random, weird, and honestly just disjointed. I still want to know how they thought that care giveaway sweepstakes was going to work :|
---
This outfit is a mistake but gw2 fashion style has already been lost long time ago.
---
&gt;  I still want to know how they thought that care giveaway sweepstakes was going to work :|
---
compared to taxi advert long time ago, KungFuckYou was closer to regular advertising than ever before
---
I don't really care but I find it pretty weird that some people will watch an animation a random guy made and then just post their criticisms. Nothing about what they liked, what was interesting or noteworthy, just criticism.
---
Not sure why these weapons get so much hate. They are great for a monochromatic character. Look awesome if you make your armor look like a Chess Piece.
---
Half of the video used on the DR. Rest of the capitals "aaaaah fuck it".
---
Also, audio montage is abysmal.
---
Still very good concept with potential of being polished to something good.
---
Charrnier
---
Does this ad make you buy PoF now or why are you so excited?
---
people talk about them separately because the locations and mechanics differ(in GW2, no agony in "dungeons" for example), so that you know they are discussing one over the other.
---
He deserves A+ for effort tho
---
Because we never got real advertisements before.
---
you know what has to happen next right, "The Avengers take on Guild Wars 2"
---
what if you're not on your period though
---
Something something, mesmers op something something
---
you can buy most inscriptions, some are account bound though.
---
It's actually the most consistent walljump since it's a similar corner jump to the one in 2-3 trib's start. If you can do that one, you can also do this one. Since it's a tight jump, you get the walljump 75% of the time, but if you do it perfectly you get on it normally just fine.
---
A Consortium Sickle
---
The faster animation helps to gather all the nodes before the mobs can attack you.
---
i'm not using anykind of stealth, just playing with the camera
---
First person mode allows your character to rotate on the spot.  Using about face does the same thing too.
---
No daily recs? 
---
On average, you get 18.2 fractal relics from picking any arbitrary T4 fractal, so let's just say 18
---
That means doing 3 T4 fractals will meet you about 54 relics
---
If you choose to convert pristine relics to normal relics, you get 12 pristine relics a day, each worth 15 relics, so that's going to net you an extra 180 a day, bringing your total up to 234 relics a day
---
Assuming you buy discounted fractal encryption keys, let's estimate that you overall spend about 15 relics to open all your chests, which brings you down to about 220 relics a day. 
---
It takes 20700 relics total to buy the omnipot, so about 94 days? If you include recs, relics/day goes up, so let's say you could probably manage in about 2-3 months using pristine relics, but it will take proabably about 4 times as long otherwjse
---
I agree with 98% of this post.
---
The 1 % is that we should wait till its released, hopefully they will polish this animation out. And apperance wise, they will fix it with gem store skins.
---
Other 1% is that httyd 3 was rly good
---
I definitely formatted it way too literally but it was not a question.
---
You don't need to move it back and forth all the time. You only need to move it for "Just in case" and "fun builds". "Meta-following business-as-usual" doesn't need more than one or two sets of Ascended and those can stay on their respective characters.
---
Alternatively, make them easier for smaller groups to accomplish
---
Some weapons are rather...ugly yes, but I personally like the GS and axe for example. Chest piece is light Corsair top and leggings T2 human cultural, I believe.
---
If I have to farm them, I do it on a many characters as possible. 4-5 chars get you around 200 berries without gathering enhancement.
---
To your original question :
---
For me it's the easiest to run through in support build with high self sustain and Condi cleanse like Heal tempest, support scourge /Firebrand
---
Good job saving Spiderman Anet! too bad you weren't there to save uncle Ben :(
---
thats a nice breakdown! thanks a lot! i did mean to include the recs xd
---
and yeah i sell the small potions i get from the chests but keep the big ones since people usually want them to be used in dailies.
---
hate to break it to you son,but 99,9% of thiefs are NOT on your lvl,they gona  +1 feed and thats about it. till they got to half of your skill,they shoud just decap =))
---
I like to do my gathering on Mesmer who has Mimic+Blink+Blink to instantly travel so far that you get out of combat.
---
I don't need to avoid combat.  
---
I just bring a poison spam shortbow thief, spam choking gas, and the enemies get interrupted and die by the time I'm done with the winterberries, since I bring the Glyph of Bounty and I get to use the nodes up to 4 times each. That means less time running between nodes, and more time gathering them, plus extra materials, exp and karma from enemies.

---
&gt; Greetings all!
---
&gt;
---
&gt;We have a Balance Update slated to release next week and wanted to get the Release Notes to you early so that you can theorycraft and discuss. Enjoy!
---
&gt;## Profession Skills
---
&gt;Elite specializations were introduced with the _Heart of Thorns™_ expansion and have become a regular sight throughout Tyria. These specializations have sometimes come with trade-offs, and sometimes they&amp;#39;ve been purely beneficial compared to a core specialization, often because they add something on top of everything the profession already does. We believe that elite specializations are a more meaningful choice when they have some trade-off or change some core part of a profession&amp;#39;s mechanics.
---
&gt;To use the example of necromancer, by choosing an elite specialization, you lose access to your core Death Shroud abilities, but you gain different abilities. This is a clear trade-off. In the case of elite specializations like druid, herald, chronomancer, berserker, or scrapper, this type of trade-off isn&amp;#39;t possible because the specialization adds a completely new ability. With this update, we&amp;#39;re targeting a few elite specializations to receive trade-offs, and we expect to continue doing this in future updates. As for general changes, we&amp;#39;ve made a few consistency updates to aura naming and introduced dark auras to the game. We also changed a number of abilities that would destroy missiles, making them block missiles instead.
---
&gt;### General
---
&gt;- Dark Leap Combo: Performing a leap finisher from a dark field will now grant players 5 seconds of Dark Aura.
---
&gt;- Dark Aura: This new effect reduces incoming condition damage by 20% and inflicts 2 seconds of torment when you are struck (1-second cooldown per attacker).
---
&gt;- Fire Shield: This effect has been renamed Fire Aura.
---
&gt;- Chaos Armor: This effect has been renamed Chaos Aura. Fixed a bug that prevented this effect from triggering some elementalist traits.
---
&gt;- Skills that destroy missiles will now block missiles instead. This change affects the following skills:
---
&gt;  - Elementalist: Swirling Winds
---
&gt;  - Engineer: Launch Wall
---
&gt;  - Guardian: Deflecting Shot, Refraction, Sanctuary, Shield of the Avenger, Zealot&amp;#39;s Defense
---
&gt;  - Mesmer: Illusionary Warden
---
&gt;  - Necromancer: Corrosive Poison Cloud
---
&gt;  - Revenant: Inspiring Reinforcement (Underwater)
---
&gt;  - Thief: Sniper&amp;#39;s Cover, Smoke Screen, Concealed Defeat
---
&gt;  - Warrior: Winds of Disenchantment
---
&gt;### Elementalist
---
&gt;With the addition of the weaver and sword abilities in _Path of Fire™_, the main-hand dagger weapon set has been struggling with its identity. The weaver&amp;#39;s sword is intended to be a single-target, high-DPS weapon that relies on direct hits to deal damage. In this update, we&amp;#39;re leaning into the dagger&amp;#39;s close-range area-of-effect damage and burst attacks.
---
&gt;- Cone of Cold: The base healing value of this skill has been increased by approximately 20%.
---
&gt;- Cleansing Wave: The base healing value of this skill has been increased by approximately 20%.
---
&gt;- Evasive Arcana: The base healing value of this trait has been increased by approximately 20%.
---
&gt;- Arcane Abatement: Cleansing Wave: The base healing value of this trait has been increased by approximately 20%.
---
&gt;- Swirling Winds: Reduced the radius of this skill from 400 to 360. The visual effect of this skill now displays a red ring for enemies and a white ring for allies.
---
&gt;- Vapor Form: Fixed an issue in which this skill would sometimes fail to revive a poisoned player. Fixed an issue in which applying barrier to an elementalist in Vapor Form prevented them from being downed when the skill ended by timing out. Removed an unlisted function of this skill that caused it to apply regeneration to nearby allies.
---
&gt;- Dragon&amp;#39;s Claw: Projectiles from this skill now pierce enemies.
---
&gt;- Ring of Earth: This skill has been slightly reworked. It now delivers an attack early in the animation, and then another attack upon impacting the ground. Bleeding duration per impact has been reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds. Initial impact damage is 27.5% of the final impact. Final impact damage has not changed from the skill&amp;#39;s initial value.
---
&gt;- Magnetic Leap: This skill has been renamed Earthen Rush and reworked.
---
&gt;  - Earthen Rush: Quickly dash along the ground, summoning damaging spikes along the way and then delivering an area attack, immobilizing any enemy struck.
---
&gt;- Lightning Whip: The range of this skill has been reduced from 300 to 240.
---
&gt;- Lightning Touch: This skill has been reworked and renamed Convergence.
---
&gt;  - Convergence: After a 1-second delay, lightning strikes the elementalist, dealing damage and weakening foes in a 240 radius while granting the elementalist fury for each foe struck.
---
&gt;- Invoke Lightning: Fixed an issue in which this skill ignored the Disable Player Camera Shake option.
---
&gt;- Glyph of Storms (Air): Fixed an issue in which this skill ignored the Disable Player Camera Shake option.
---
&gt;- Imbued Melodies: This trait now uses the Lesser Sand Squall skill instead of the Sand Squall skill.
---
&gt;### Engineer
---
&gt;Following the previous gyro updates, we&amp;#39;ve had the opportunity to update gyros for underwater use as well. With the change to Blunderbuss, we&amp;#39;re aiming to give clarity about the best-use scenarios for this skill by reducing the size of the tooltip and making it clear that closer is always better, rather than using complicated, staggered range thresholds. If this goes well, we&amp;#39;re likely to update other abilities in a similar fashion to provide more best-use clarity in future updates.
---
&gt;- Blunderbuss: Rather than inflicting between 1 and 4 stacks of bleeding for 7 seconds based on range, this skill now inflicts 3 stacks of bleeding with a duration of between 3 and 9 seconds based on range. This skill has been reworked to scale damage dynamically based on distance rather than at various tiers so that closer is always better, not just when the engineer crosses a particular range threshold. The range of this skill has been increased from 700 to 900.
---
&gt;- Jump Shot: This skill now animates more smoothly when used to reach a lower elevation.
---
&gt;- Poison Dart Volley: Projectiles fired by this skill no longer fire in a randomized cone. Updated skill facts to show the full attack damage rather than the damage of individual darts.
---
&gt;- Holographic Shockwave: Fixed a bug that could cause this skill to fail to hit targets at the center of the attack.
---
&gt;- Shredder Gyro: Reduced the casting time of this skill by 0.3 seconds, and increased the damage inflicted by 33%.
---
&gt;- Experimental Turrets: Fixed a bug that caused the underwater Supply Crate&amp;#39;s Rocket Turret to apply might instead of retaliation.
---
&gt;- Gyros can now be used underwater.
---
&gt;### Guardian
---
&gt;This update focuses primarily on tuning up core guardian skills and traits that haven&amp;#39;t aged very well. Mace skill improvements and some fixes to how torch skills interact with the Radiant Fire trait should help these aspects of guardians fit in better with new specialization options. We&amp;#39;re also extending ground-targeting functionality to all spirit weapons to give players more precise control.
---
&gt;- Hammer Chain Skills: Adjusted attack animations and damage to get a smoother attack sequence. The full attack chain is slightly faster with less damage, resulting in a small increase in overall damage per second.
---
&gt;- Faithful Strike: Lowered the full casting time by 0.3 seconds. Increased damage by 10%. Lowered healing slightly.
---
&gt;- Symbol of Faith: Increased damage by 30%.
---
&gt;- Protector&amp;#39;s Strike: This skill now uses full-body animation for the finishing strike, even while the player is moving. The recovery animation is now shortened if an attack is not blocked. If this skill does not block an attack, it fully charges Virtue of Justice.
---
&gt;- Zealot&amp;#39;s Flame: This skill now displays an effect when it pulses to show the effective radius.
---
&gt;- Zealot&amp;#39;s Fire: This skill now uses the ammunition system. The Radiant Fire trait now adds 1 cast to the skill if it triggers while Zealot&amp;#39;s Flame is active.
---
&gt;- Spirit Weapons: These skills are now all ground-targeted while the player is on land.
---
&gt;- Shield of the Avenger: Reduced the range from 1,200 to 900. Reduced the explosion radius from 1,200 to 360. Reduced the projectile speed by 25%. Added missing skill facts for shield radius and explosion radius.
---
&gt;- Hammer of Wisdom: Updated the tooltip to display the sink effect instead of the knockdown effect while underwater. Fixed an issue in which the sink duration was 1 second instead of 2 seconds.
---
&gt;- Right-Hand Strength: This trait no longer gives a flat critical-hit chance. Instead it gives an additional 80 precision, plus an additional 80 power while wielding a one-handed weapon.
---
&gt;- Zealot&amp;#39;s Defense: Damage has been increased by 50% in PvE only. Fixed a bug that caused some visual effects to display on the player when enemies were hit.
---
&gt;### Mesmer
---
--- continued below ---
---
^(Beep boop bleep. I'm a bot. Message me or /u/Xyooz if you have any questions, suggestions or concerns.) [^Source ^Code](https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/docker-polarbytebot-gw2-submission-transcriber)
---
&gt;Mesmer traits that influence shatter skills typically affect all shatter skills, which has caused a lot of design bloat over the years. In this update, we&amp;#39;re moving to change some of these traits to affect specific shatter skills in a stronger way, in order to both cut down on this bloat and to make the individual trait selections more meaningful. Other traits, such as Flow of Time and Seize the Moment, have had their boons changed from multiple stacks to a single stack in order to make it less likely that rapid shattering will cause the mesmer to run over the stack cap. Finally, Mass Invisibility has fallen behind other mesmer elite skills—as well as other sources of stealth over the years—so we&amp;#39;re giving it a boost to help it compete.
---
&gt;- Magic Bullet: Stun duration for this skill has been increased from 2 seconds to 2.5 seconds.
---
&gt;- Counter Blade: Daze duration for this ability has been increased from 1 second to 2 seconds.
---
&gt;- Illusionary Counter: This skill now uses an 8-second cooldown in all game modes.
---
&gt;- Confusing Images: The physical damage of this skill has been split and reduced by 50% in PvP and WvW.
---
&gt;- Signet of Illusions: This skill&amp;#39;s recharge now begins at the same time shatter skills are recharged.
---
&gt;- Mantra of Distraction: Daze time for this skill has been increased from 1 second to 1.5 seconds.
---
&gt;- Confounding Suggestions: This trait no longer increases daze and stun durations. Instead, Diversion stuns foes for 1.5 seconds and no longer dazes foes.
---
&gt;- Blinding Dissipation: This trait no longer blinds foes on the activation of each shatter skill. It will now cause Cry of Frustration to blind every target it strikes. Blindness duration is split between game modes, lasting 1.5 seconds in WvW and PvP and 3 seconds in PvE.
---
&gt;- Dazzling: This trait now applies vulnerability when stunning a foe, in addition to when dazing them.
---
&gt;- Flow of Time: This trait now grants the full alacrity amount as soon as it is activated instead of waiting for illusions to shatter.
---
&gt;- Seize the Moment: This trait now grants the full quickness amount as soon as it is activated instead of waiting for illusions to shatter.
---
&gt;- Master of Manipulation: Instead of granting the mirror effect, this trait now grants superspeed for 3 seconds. This superspeed is also applied to allies affected by your manipulation skills.
---
&gt;- Mass Invisibility: Reduced the casting time of the land version of this skill to match the underwater version. Increased the base stealth duration from 5 seconds to 6 seconds. Reduced the recharge from 90 seconds to 60 seconds.
---
&gt;- Evasive Mirror: Increased this trait&amp;#39;s cooldown from 1.5 seconds to 10 seconds in PvP and WvW.
---
&gt;### Necromancer
---
&gt;Necromancers have some solid roles right now across each game type. With this update, we&amp;#39;re touching on a few core weapon abilities whose functionality had not been updated in a long time. We&amp;#39;re also reworking the reaper&amp;#39;s Soul Eater trait into a more general trait that can be more competitive with the other damage options in its tier. Since this trait previously affected greatsword skills, we&amp;#39;ve done a pass on the weapon skills to keep them up to par.
---
&gt;- Gravedigger: Increased the range from 170 to 180 to make the range a standard multiple of 60.
---
&gt;- Crimson Tide: This skill now grants 2% life force per hit.
---
&gt;- Locust Swarm: This skill will now inflict its effects every 0.5 seconds instead of every second. The duration of this skill has been halved, so the same number of attacks will occur, but they will occur faster. The radius of this skill has been reduced from 210 to 180 to make the range a standard multiple of 60. Finally, rather than inflicting damage on each pulse, Locust Swarm will now siphon health from enemies within its area of effect.
---
&gt;- Reaper&amp;#39;s Touch: This skill has been significantly reworked, and it has been renamed Soul Grasp.
---
&gt;  - Soul Grasp: This skill has two casts. Each cast sends forth a disembodied hand to inflict vulnerability on foes, grant the necromancer life force, and steal health from a foe.
---
&gt;- Death Spiral: Reduced the recharge time from 12 seconds to 10 seconds. Increased the range from 220 to 240 to make the range a standard multiple of 60. Adjusted the visual effects of this skill to be more pronounced. Narrowed the attack cone so that this skill&amp;#39;s attack region more accurately matches its animation. Removed bonus damage to targets above 50% health. Increased base damage by 28% in PvE and 6% in PvP and WvW.
---
&gt;- Grasping Darkness: Increased the range from 750 to 900 to make the range a standard multiple of 60. Fixed issues that caused this skill to unexpectedly fail when hitting some objects. This skill will no longer be stopped by projectile blocking or reflecting.
---
&gt;- Sand Swell: Fixed a bug that could prevent movement for a short time when the skill failed due to targeting an invalid location.
---
&gt;- Soul Eater: This trait has been reworked. It now increases the strike damage dealt to all foes within a range of 300 by 10%, and it causes the reaper to heal for 5% of the damage dealt to foes within that range. It no longer reduces greatsword-skill recharge by 20%.
---
&gt;### Ranger
---
&gt;With this update, druids, who gain a new mode and access to additional abilities by slotting the specialization, get the trade-off of their pet becoming a bit weaker than a core ranger's pet, as their focus on celestial magics means less time strengthening the bond with their pets. At the same time, druid glyphs have been reviewed and brought in line with design standards. Glyph of Empowerment has been replaced by the former druid elite skill, Glyph of Unity, as Glyph of Empowerment was deemed too passive. Glyph of Unity&amp;#39;s radius has been reduced to a standard radius (a multiple of 60), and its duration has increased. Finally, we&amp;#39;ve introduced a new elite skill, Glyph of the Stars, which you can read about in its note below.
---
&gt;- Nature&amp;#39;s Renewal: Added an additional ring visual effect to indicate the range of the toggle skill.
---
&gt;- Druid: The base attributes of pets have been reduced by 20%.
---
&gt;- Glyph of Unity: Reduced the radius of this skill from 400 to 360, and increased its duration from 6 seconds to 8 seconds. This skill is no longer an elite skill, and it replaces Glyph of Empowerment.
---
&gt;- Glyph of Rejuvenation: Increased the healing multiplier across both versions of this skill by 40%. In celestial avatar form, the base healing to the druid and their pet has been increased by 50%. Outside of celestial avatar form, the base healing to allies has been increased by 50%.
---
&gt;- Glyph of Alignment: Outside of celestial avatar form, this skill no longer inflicts 5 seconds of cripple or 2 stacks of poison for 8 seconds. Instead, it now inflicts 1.5 seconds of immobilization and 3 stacks of bleeding for 8 seconds.
---
&gt;- Glyph of Empowerment: This skill has been replaced by Glyph of Unity.
---
&gt;- Glyph of the Stars: This new elite skill heals, prevents allies from being inflicted with conditions, and removes conditions already on allies at range. In celestial avatar form, it heals, prevents downed allies from losing health while being revived, and grants boons at range.
---
&gt;- Pack Alpha: This trait now grants its attribute bonus to condition damage in addition to the attributes it previously affected.
---
&gt;- Poison Master: This trait no longer grants poison on the next attack when swapping pets. It now grants this effect upon the use of a beast skill.
---
&gt;### Revenant
---
&gt;In the case of revenant elite specializations, we felt that the herald and renegade didn&amp;#39;t necessarily need trade-offs. Instead, we felt that the core revenant was missing something. To address this, we&amp;#39;ve added a new F2 skill that is only available when players aren&amp;#39;t running an elite specialization that grants a boost to energy and a legend-specific effect. Heralds and renegades won&amp;#39;t have access to this skill as they have their own unique specialization F2 skills.
---
&gt;This update also sees a large overhaul of revenant healing builds through changes to the staff weapon and the Salvation trait line. Revenant healing is heavily focused in Legendary Centaur stance and suffers greatly when the need to swap legends presents itself. We&amp;#39;re leaning into the unique healing-orb mechanic of the staff&amp;#39;s weapon-slot 1 sequence and spreading it around to other skills and traits. This should allow revenants to have better healing to fill the gaps when they&amp;#39;re not channeling Ventari. Salvation traits have been reworked to focus around more cohesive themes in order to better allow revenant players to tailor their experience to the style of healer they want to play.
---
&gt;- Ventari&amp;#39;s Tablet: The tablet will now display a red, glowing visual effect to enemies.
---
&gt;- Energy Expulsion: Updated the description of this skill to refer to the created objects as &amp;quot;healing fragments&amp;quot; rather than the misleading term &amp;quot;energy fragments.&amp;quot;
---
&gt;- True Nature: Fixed an issue that prevented this set of skills from being considered Legendary Dragon consume skills for the purposes of traits.
---
&gt;- Drop the Hammer: This skill now displays a red ring visual effect to enemies. Fixed a bug in which this skill would rarely display its effects a second time.
---
&gt;- Ancient Echo: This new baseline revenant skill grants the revenant 25 energy and a benefit based on the current legend. When not using herald or renegade elite specializations, this skill will be available in the second slot of the profession mechanic bar.
---
&gt;  - Legendary Assassin Stance: Gain 2 stacks of the Unblockable effect for 5 seconds.
---
&gt;  - Legendary Centaur Stance: Gain 3 seconds of the Alacrity effect.
---
&gt;  - Legendary Dwarf Stance: Gain 3 seconds of the Rite of the Great Dwarf effect.
---
&gt;  - Legendary Demon Stance: Gain 3 seconds of the Resistance effect.
---
&gt;- Healing Orbs: These objects were previously dropped only by the staff&amp;#39;s weapon skill 1 attack, but they have been reworked and are now created by other skills and traits.
---
&gt;  - Increased the size of the healing orbs&amp;#39; visual effects for better visibility.
---
&gt;  - Healing orbs now heal up to 5 allies in a 120 radius when picked up.
---
&gt;  - Healing orbs now activate even if the character that triggered them is at full health.
---
&gt;  - Healing orbs now activate if they appear on a character.
---
&gt;  - Increased the healing of the orbs.
---
&gt;- Punishing Sweep: This skill is no longer a sequence skill and has been renamed Mender&amp;#39;s Rebuke. This skill&amp;#39;s functionality has changed.
---
&gt;  - Mender&amp;#39;s Rebuke: This skill strikes foes in melee range, and then heals allies in the area after a short delay. The healing is increased by 50% if a foe was struck during the attack.
---
&gt;- Warding Rift: Clarified the description to specify that this skill blocks incoming attacks. Instead of shooting projectiles, this skill now blinds foes in front of the revenant when it ends. Increased the number of targets from 3 to 5. Increased damage by 100%.
---
&gt;- Renewing Wave: When this skill removes a condition, it now creates a healing orb near the target.
---
&gt;- Ventari&amp;#39;s Will: Reduced base healing by approximately 25%. Reduced healing-power scaling by 18%.
---
&gt;- Salvation traits have been reworked and repositioned within the specialization. The new structure is as follows:
---
&gt;  - Minor traits:
---
&gt;    - Healer&amp;#39;s Gift: This new trait causes a healing orb to be created near your location when you finish a dodge roll.
---
&gt;    - Life Attunement: This new trait grants 120 healing power and converts 7% of healing power to concentration.
---
&gt;    - Serene Rejuvenation: This trait&amp;#39;s functionality is unchanged.
---
&gt;  - Adept traits:
---
&gt;    - Vital Blessing: This new trait allows healing orbs to grant 2 seconds of vigor to affected allies.
---
&gt;    - Blinding Truths: This trait&amp;#39;s functionality is unchanged.
---
&gt;    - Tranquil Balance: This trait&amp;#39;s functionality is unchanged.
---
&gt;  - Master traits:
---
&gt;    - Words of Censure: This new trait creates a healing orb near foes when blinding, immobilizing, or affecting them with a control effect. This trait has a 0.25-second cooldown but can create multiple orbs if a single skill hits multiple foes with a single strike.
---
&gt;    - Resilient Spirit: This new trait causes the revenant to gain barrier every 3 seconds while in combat, based on the number of boons they have (to a maximum of 5 boons).
---
&gt;    - Invoking Harmony: Icon updated. This trait&amp;#39;s functionality is unchanged.
---
&gt;  - Grandmaster traits:
---
&gt;    - Generous Abundance: With this new trait, Legendary Centaur skills create 3 healing orbs by the tablet. All other legend skills create 1 healing orb by the revenant.
---
&gt;    - Unyielding Devotion: With this new trait, revenants gain 15% damage reduction for 2 seconds when they heal themselves and 5 seconds when they heal an ally.
---
&gt;    - Selfless Amplification: Moved to bottom row. Icon updated. This trait&amp;#39;s functionality is unchanged.
---
&gt;### Thief
---
&gt;Our focus on the thief in this update has been toward daredevil, its traits, and the trade-off that it was inherently built without. Daredevil traits have been reworked to focus on three categories: choosing your defense in the Adept tier; choosing your damage in the Master tier; and choosing your dodge maneuver in the Grandmaster tier. With this update, we are adding a trade-off to the profession skill that keeps the theme of a melee-oriented specialization.
---
&gt;- Repeater: Initiative cost of this skill has been reduced from 4 to 2 in all game modes.
---
&gt;- Staff Strike: The damage of this skill has been reduced by 6.5%.
---
&gt;- Staff Bash: The damage of this skill has been reduced by 6.5%.
---
&gt;- Physical Supremacy: This trait now causes Steal to become Swipe, which reduces the range from 1,200 to 600 and makes the attack unblockable.
---
&gt;- Marauder&amp;#39;s Resilience: This new trait converts 7% of power to vitality while reducing incoming damage from foes within 360 range by 10%.
---
&gt;- Weakening Strikes: This trait has been moved from the Adept tier into the Minor Master tier and has had its functionality changed. This trait will now cause the daredevil&amp;#39;s next strike after dodging to weaken enemies. This weakening effect can be applied to multiple targets at once if the skill used is an area-of-effect skill. Reduced the weakness duration from 5 seconds to 3 seconds. Increased the damage dealt to weakened foes by 7%, and reduced damage taken from foes by 10%.
---
&gt;- Escapist&amp;#39;s Absolution: This trait has been merged with Driven Fortitude and renamed Escapist&amp;#39;s Fortitude. It is now an Adept-tier trait.
---
&gt;- Staff Master: This trait no longer grants a percentage damage increase based on endurance. Instead, it grants 120 power, and grants an additional 120 power when the thief wields a staff. The endurance gain per initiative point remains the same.
---
&gt;- Havoc Mastery: This trait has been renamed Havoc Specialist, and it has been moved to the Master tier. This trait now grants 5% bonus damage for each bar of endurance that is not full.
---
&gt;### Warrior
---
&gt;In this update, the warrior&amp;#39;s berserker elite specialization is seeing a drastic overhaul. The goal of these changes is to give the specialization more compelling and thematic core gameplay that better distinguishes it from base warrior and spellbreaker gameplay.
---
&gt;To this end, the first major change is that we&amp;#39;re moving the berserk-mode activation to the F1 slot and removing the F2 slot entirely. In order to use primal bursts, a berserker must now activate berserk mode first. Removing access to normal warrior bursts and putting primal bursts behind berserk mode focuses the specialization around its unique mechanic.
---
&gt;Additionally, berserk mode itself has been changed and will grant power and condition-damage bonuses in exchange for a toughness penalty. We&amp;#39;re doing this in order to solidify the berserker&amp;#39;s identity as a powerful but fragile combatant. Those willing to take the risks should find higher damage output than other, more durable, warrior options.
---
&gt;Another major change is in how berserk mode is managed. Previously it was a limited-time mode with a set duration. This update changes the primary functionality of rage skills to extend berserk-mode duration rather than granting adrenaline. While they are still useful skills outside of berserk mode, proper use while in berserk mode can dramatically extend the damage window to use primal bursts.
---
&gt;Finally, we&amp;#39;re making some changes to several berserker traits and primal burst skills in order to allow power-berserker builds to exist alongside the more popular condition damage variant.
---
&gt;- Double Chop: Adjusted the attack timing so that the hits occur later in the animation. Adjusted the damage so that the second hit deals more damage than the first. Total damage and casting time are unchanged.
---
&gt;- Battle Standard: Fixed a bug that caused this skill to have a shorter casting time while underwater than on land. Adjusted the timing of the visual effects so that the attack lines up properly with the banner&amp;#39;s arrival.
---
&gt;- Banners: Adjusted timing for skill warm-up visual effects.
---
&gt;- Magebane Tether: Fixed a bug that could cause this trait to fail when the warrior used an unblockable burst skill against a blocking foe. Fixed a bug that caused this trait to fail if the warrior was airborne.
---
&gt;- Rampage: Fixed a bug that caused this skill to show an incorrect duration in PvP and WvW.
---
&gt;- Berserker elite specialization changes include the following:
---
&gt;  - Berserk:
---
&gt;      - This skill has been moved to slot 1 of the profession mechanic bar. Slot 2 of the profession mechanic bar has been removed when warriors use the berserker specialization.
---
&gt;      - Berserk mode is no longer instant and has a casting time.
---
&gt;      - Entering berserk mode now initiates an attack that damages nearby foes and inflicts burning for 3 seconds.
---
&gt;      - Berserk mode is no longer a rage skill. Instead, it is considered a level-3 burst skill.
---
&gt;  - Primal Bursts: Removed some visual warm-up effects from these skills that could obscure the character.
---
&gt;  - Decapitate: This skill has been reworked. It is now a long-range melee attack that does not leap forward and only hits 1 target. This skill recharges instantly if it hits and can be affected by quickness and slow.
---
&gt;  - Arc Divider: This skill has been reworked. It no longer deals bonus damage to low-health targets. Instead, it now spins and strikes 3 times. Each strike increases in radius.
---
&gt;  - Rupturing Smash: Cleaned up animation, and reduced casting time by approximately 0.1 seconds.
---
&gt;  - Flaming Flurry: Updated the description and tooltip of this skill to clarify that it blocks missiles.
---
&gt;  - Rage Skills: These skills no longer restore adrenaline by default. Instead, rage skills extend the duration of berserk mode.
---
&gt;  - Wild Blow: This skill no longer gives adrenaline or removes conditions. Instead, it extends the duration of berserk mode by 3 seconds if it hits. It also grants 8 seconds of fury if it hits.
---
&gt;  - Sundering Leap: Cleaned up animation, and reduced casting time by approximately 0.1 seconds. This skill no longer grants adrenaline. Instead, it extends berserk by 5 seconds if it hits.
---
&gt;  - Outrage: This skill no longer grants adrenaline. Instead, it extends berserk by 1 second. It extends berserk by 5 seconds if a stun is broken.
---
*weary stare*
---
&gt;  - Blood Reckoning: This skill now only recharges primal burst skills instead of all burst skills. It extends berserk mode duration by 2 seconds.
---
&gt;  - Shattering Blow: This skill no longer grants adrenaline. It now extends berserk duration by 2 seconds on hit.
---
&gt;  - Head Butt: This skill extends berserk duration by 2 seconds in addition to its previous effects.
---
&gt;  - Dead or Alive: This trait now increases incoming healing by 10% in addition to its previous effects.
---
&gt;  - Bloody Roar: Increased the damage bonus of this trait from 10% to 20%. It no longer causes berserk mode to taunt.
---
&gt;  - Eternal Champion: This trait no longer grants stability when first entering berserk mode. Instead, it grants 300 toughness in berserk mode.
---
&gt;  - Savage Instinct: This trait no longer removes conditions. Instead, it gives 100% damage resistance for 1 second when activating berserk mode, in addition to breaking stuns.
---
&gt;  - Fatal Frenzy: This trait no longer gives boons. Instead, while in berserk mode, this trait reduces toughness by 300, increases power by 300, and increases condition damage by 300.
---
&gt;  - Always Angry: This trait has been reworked and renamed Burst of Aggression.
---
&gt;    - Burst of Aggression: Grants quickness and superspeed for 3 seconds when berserk mode is first activated.
---
&gt;  - Smash Brawler: This trait no longer reduces recharge of berserk mode and primal bursts. Instead, it extends the duration of berserk mode by 5 seconds.
---
&gt; How about i send you under the map?
---
&gt;

&gt; ​
---
&gt; How about at the other end of the map?
---
Nononononono you get it completely wrong. 
---
To make the portal most efficient you place *both* sides, entrace and exit under a chest. This way you cover *two* chest with only one portal.
---
I had this exact same problem last year. Pressing play crashed the game and characters' faces were gone. First I would try repairing your client, but if that doesn't work, it might be a problem with the integrated graphics in your CPU. Unfortunately I don't remember how I fixed the graphics issue, but maybe try updating your integrated graphics driver.
---
I don't know if it's still accurate, but according to [this chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1stw9RIOjS2ENOelHPhp494ne90e2G3xQNUUfmQ6mXBs) consortium (and molten) behave like that as well.

That link is misleading and outdated. He's using a setup that doesn't even work anymore: trapper and nightmare runes combined. He's using class builds that don't even exist anymore, like afk mirage that let the phantasms autoattack, which they no longer do. His numbers are wildly off too, he's getting only 2/3 of the damage he should be getting for his Viper benchmarks. 
---
Don't come in here trying to "gotcha!" me and act like I'm spreading false information, and then link blatantly false, outdated stuff. That doesn't help anyone. I understand that it's fun to try to prove someone wrong on the Internet, but check your sources and information first, dude.
---
lol what a dumb comment
---
A patchnote without changes to Mesmer boon spread. What is this sorcercy?
---
What gate? I only see the meta male human infront of the attention-grabbing mounts behind him.
---
/s
---
&gt;Chaos Armor: This effect has been renamed Chaos Aura.   
---
&gt;Skills that destroy missiles will now block missiles instead. 
---
Not sure how I feel about these
---
You should have added the complimentary hydra...
---
Is power berserker really going to be viable? Couldn't be happier!
---
Druid still has Glyph of Empowerment, which is great for fractals and generally burst down a boss with a coordinated team. 
---
Although not exclusive to Druid, Spirits are great too.
---
Hey, I took a 6 months break but finally came back to the game. I decided to level up an Ele as that's one of the only class I know pretty much nothing about. I'm not level 80, with a mix of berserk / assassin ascended gear (followed the snowcrows [build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/sword/)
---
I'm still learning the rotation, and while it isn't perfect I'm doing fairly ok right now so I decided to try Fractal T3 daily yesterday and today. My DPS is good, but fucking hell every trash mob 2 shot me. Was wondering if I'm doing something bad, or if it's just the fate of every melee Elementalist to die in 2 hits.
---
Chaos has a nice Staff trait + similar traits. Chaos Storm is a really nice ability.
---
Crazy how nature do that
---
My poor lightning whip, why?
---
Mesmers unite:
---
&gt;Confounding Suggestions: This trait no longer increases daze and stun durations. Instead, Diversion stuns foes for 1.5 seconds and no longer dazes foes.
---
This obviously results in less potential Breakbar from Shield 5 and Moa/Gravity Well, but can anyone tell if Diversion will provide more CC than before with this trait, or about the same? Probably means no more reason to go Domination even when more CC is needed.
---
Lion's Arch could start off being the old LA, then burning down, and then rebuilding into the new LA.
---
all i want is for power warrior to be at least viable.
---
Can you stop making such changes to Berserker? There's nothing wrong with it, stop touching things simply because you don't know what else to do.
---
🦀GoE Gone🦀
---
Man I would love to. But all my friends and guilds are on NA servers since ex girlfriend tranferred me there some years ago :\ cool idea tho. Hope some muricans will do the same so I can join.
---
High elves = humans and wood elves = sylvari from Elder Scrolls
---
&gt;druids, who gain a new mode and access to additional abilities by slotting the specialization, get the trade-off of their pet becoming a bit weaker than a core ranger's pet, as their focus on celestial magics means less time strengthening the bond with their pets. 
---
Wait a minute, has the lore team infiltrated the balance team?
---
They better bring back old Aura visuals.
---
Seems like they realy wanted to shake things up with this one. I'm realy curious about the new heal rev o/
---
&gt;Reaper's Touch: This skill has been significantly reworked, and it has been renamed Soul Grasp.
---
&gt;Soul Grasp: This skill has two casts. Each cast sends forth a disembodied hand to inflict vulnerability on foes, grant the necromancer life force, and steal health from a foe.
---
necros rejoice
---
Gyros go un-nerfed. Thank god.
---
Also rip some pvp DD builds.
---
I remember having the issue but I forget if I ever managed to fix it ( i now use dx12 so.. :/)
---
You remind me of my kids being around 2 years old, never could sleep along the bed.
---
Man, I was just getting my daredevil rotation down too (not that it's hard, I'm just bad at this stuff!)
---
Yeah, Throw Bolas really needed the ammunition system. Before the charge it was considered the worst utility in the game, and now it functions as a high uptime of Peak Performance.
---
&gt; ArenaNet is also awful at interpreting data.
---
A baseless claim arising from your position of complete ignorance. The only thing you know is that Arenanet made a decision contrary to your opinion. Since Arenanet has a successful game and you don't, I'm going maintain my opinion that they know more about creating games than you do.
---
&gt; They didn't even stop to think of the reasons why
---
More ignorance. You have no idea what discussions or meetings occurred inside Arenanet.
---
&gt; No one played the new dungeon because loot was garbage, and afking at the svanir shaman wasn't only easier, but more profitable as well.
---
Another conclusion based on no data.
---
Yes. It did say on the description.
---
This is coming next week?  Does that mean we're not getting Episode 6 until May?  Or are they hopefully going to break their standard and release patches 2 weeks in a row.
---
&gt; Skills that destroy missiles will now block missiles instead
---
Functionally, what does this change?
---
Presumably those skills will now trigger on block or when blocked abilities.
---
I guess I'll just wait till August to buy HoT then.. Q_Q
---
the projectile block seems to be both update to clarity and to affect few selected traits
---
&gt;Confounding Suggestions: This trait no longer increases daze and stun durations. Instead, Diversion stuns foes for 1.5 
---
So chaos or dueling for cc now. Neat?
---
make sure your windows language didnt change
---
Another balance patch, another Reaper buff, I'm pretty happy.  I think the reworked Soul Eater will crowd out the other two choices in the tree though.  
---
The 5% lifesteal makes Reaper even more OP for solo play, and its DPS boost should make up for the loss of self-might gain.  It should be the best DPS option for fractals/raids (Although with this change, I'm pretty sure Reaper will need some Assassins gear to crit cap since it requires dropping Decimate Defenses which is a nice free crit chance boost.)

Hi, I'm new to these "meta portal \*lellies\*", but the picture just shows the starter and exit portal between chests? -- is one portal actually somewhere else, not actually on the next chest?
---
I've experienced the box'o'fun, though. Was hard to be all pissed off when I saw my asura running around pretending to be a child, hearing airoplane noises.
---
Me too!
---
🦀A-Net won't respond to this thread🦀
---
🦀A-Net still hasn't paid the ARP contest winners🦀
---
Ah, I didn't think about this. My first thought was whether or not you get put into combat, but I wasn't sure if destroying projectiles did so.
---
Confounding Suggestions in the new change keeps the increased daze duration for the Diversion shatter that it used to have, basically. However it's a somewhat significant nerf because all other dazes and stuns are no longer affected. I wouldn't say it's game-breaking though. 
---
* old: stuns +25%, dazes +50%
---
* new: diversion shatter deals 50% more break (1.5 sec vs 1 sec) and is now a stun instead of daze
---
Dead game, all the mesmers left.
---
I have been floating in T2 plat EU with my core condi mesmer build. With these changed it will be nerfed to ground sadly (but I agree scepter needed a nerf, although 50% cut seems excessive)
---
&gt;Arc Divider: This skill has been reworked. It no longer deals bonus damage to low-health targets. Instead, it now spins and strikes 3 times. Each strike increases in radius.
---
SPIN TO WIN!
---
Anyone has an idea how to buy from them through Europe?
---
Could you buy through europe?
---
It's fate of every glass cannon in high fractals. Tempest makes it slightly more bearable though.
---
That music level that keeps going up and down though.
---
Viper is a huge upgrade. You can get the trinkets pretty easily from the LS3 maps if you have been playing in them and saving resources. For the armor and weapons, I find the easiest thing to do is craft  non Vipers ascended stuff then convert it to Vipers.
---
&gt;Physical Supremacy: This trait now causes Steal to become Swipe, which reduces the range from 1,200 to 600 and makes the attack unblockable.
---
this is horrible its a huge nerf for spvp. Im not going to quit the game because of that but its definetly going to make me enjoy the game a lot less i dislike playing s/d core and now im forced to do that or stop playing.
---
I swear to God those things are coded to know when you are in combat with another mob and run straight to you.
---
I can't count the times I've thought "better kill this hydra first before fighting this mob I need," only to have the thing practically run from me. So I let it go, because I don't really want to fight the 5 other groups it will pull me into. Then when it is half way across the map I'll pull the mob I need to kill. Then that fucking hydra will straight up sprint in a straight line directly to where I'm fighting.
---
I see what you're doing Anet. I see it.
---
Since it hasn't been mentioned yet...  
---
&gt; Poison Dart Volley: Projectiles fired by this skill no longer fire in a  randomized cone. Updated skill facts to show the full attack damage  rather than the damage of individual darts. 
---
No more random volley spread!
---
The new F2 ability on Core Rev will be a big boost to Power Rev too, 25 free energy will go a long way.
---
Master of Manipulation change is one I really do not like.
---
Slowly my ass. Bloody thing sprints straight at me.
---
I had just geared up my harrier druid, at least the trinkets can swap over :P lol
---
More like druid is gone.
---
Noooo, why force Daredevil into a 600 range Steal. Don't make it a minor trait, I don't want that shit, leave Dagger Pistol Dash alone for fuck sake.
---
obviously berserker and daredevil needed the serious changes while power revenants and reaper have been obsolete in PVE.
---
Same clueless gimmicks as usual. More druid nerfs and a buff to renegade healing despite renegade being a superior druid.
---
If this isn’t proof that these developers base every design choice in pvp then I don’t know what is.
---
I guess it's fine because Unblockable already makes it so ranged projectiles can't be destroyed or reflected. Now it will a little more consistent and less complicated.
---
Strike damage is direct damage from active skills. So it's basically all power damage, but it might not affect things like lifesteal damage.
---
Looking forward trying out the new berserker. Hoping its going to be viable
---
the expressions of the mounts on that pose hahaha
---
It is still nearly 2x the range of every other melee weapon attack in the game.
---
No it won’t lol. The 5 useless unblockables won’t be either.
---
End of season means announcements, as has been the trend since LS2.  Meaning that the episode itself may done, but the company restructuring means they must have their future plans in order before dropping a teaser. Especially now more than ever, they must show they can persevere.
---
Was it even meta? I don't get why the extreme nerf. Especially with the more bunker meta seems to be developing.
---
The worst one is coming out of suns refuge, and that one jacaranda near the grave that always goes for me the moment I load into the map -_-
---
its such a minor difference comparing druid/chrono to like firegade setup. Not enough to impact success of a raid.
---
Going to need to put on more concentration gear/food
---
Bro this is sick
---
No, leave me alone.
---
;_;
---
Its a black magic of making fractals fb+rene only. Chrono already had some problems with 5ppl boon generation, and instead of adressing that, they are removing druid.
---
If it is flat 10% boost, I'm eager to see numbers on how it fares against Decimate Defenses as far as dmg output goes.
---
The scepter itself? I think so. Both chronobunker and condi mirages were using it
---
I wait to open caches.  Only at jp's or a known situation do I take a mesmer portal or trust one to not troll you.  I wont knowingly rez a mesmer in open world either.
---
Oof big nerfs to main meta classes with this one it looks like:
---
Ele: nothing much changed, support slightly buffed, condi slightly nerfed
---
Engi: nothing much changed, a couple bug/annoying issue fixes
---
Guard: nothing much changed, mostly hammer changes
---
Mesmer: big shatter changes for mirage, slight buff and nerfs to cc capabilities
---
Necro: nothing much changed, just a few range fixes to be in-line with a 60-range multiple
---
Ranger: druid glyph reworks rip GoE
---
Revenant: big changes to heal/salvation rev, no longer has a source of regen beyond the kalla trait which grants it on a successful evade
---
Thief: straight power nerfs for daredevil
---
Warrior: this one's a biggy. big nerfs likely for condi berserker as there are now cast times for things that werent. power berserker might see a dps increase but still be pretty bad from what I can tell.
---
Oh well, mesmer still useless in wvw...
---
Me too.  Dropping Decimate Defenses will require taking assassins gear for sure.  But even if this new trait goes even in DPS, 5% lifesteal makes it the clearly superior option.
---
I don't think there was such thing as "optimal 5 man comp" for every encounter at once, but now they  are really making chrono composition one man show.
---
You lose some break bar damage on shield though, so it might be a wash
---
Stop, this is just too true.
---
That's really cool! thx
---
i meant raids as in pve but apparently it's fine as an SB, will have to reroll for WvW though
---
Cries in power DPS druid solo player. I love the longbow + greatsword + glyphs combo too much.
---
underwater
---
Based on their wording, that's what it sounds like. If you manually press torch 4, and proc the trait before you throw the fire, you won't just waste the proc anymore. It sounds like you can still proc torch 4 from the trait as normal, throw it, activate torch 4 manually, and throw that. 
---
So FB gameplay doesn't sound like it'll change, other than not accidentally wasting procs. You should still wait for torch 4 procs and throw 2 fires before going into F1.
---
Underwater?
---
&gt; SPIN TO WIN!
---
DEMACIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
I wanna join in the mesmer! How much do you guys aim to play?
---
whatyearisit.jpg
---
And chronos have already been struggling. Kind of a shame for those people who enjoy playing chrono. Playing ren isnt really an option for them, because the gameplay is so radically different. Personally pressing f4 for 100% alacrity uptime just feels wrong....who needs engaging gameplay anymore?
---
Good to see them giving some love to core revenant. Hopefully it won't be lackluster to play revenant without an elite spec.
---
And other joke you can tell yourself
---
Any projectiles which are unblockable could previously be destroyed (see death's judgement) however now unblockable projectiles will not be stopped by those skills
---
Its because it allowed Mesmer to go full defensive while relying on Sceptre 3 for the Damage.
---
The Chronobunker build for example goes full defence and with some setup (as in CC so they dont dodge) you can still hit people for like 10k (depending on armour and lower on heavy armour) with Sceptre 3. it just scaled too high with power on a predominantly condi/duelist weapon.
---
This will make it so Mesmers have to commit to damage or bunker, not both.
---
RHS no longer changing crit when swapping between sets
---
Ground-targeted spirit weapons
---
Torch 4 ammo system
---
Hammer auto speed increase
---
Mace speed increase
---
Sword 3 buff
---
this patch is full of QoL for guards
---
Ahhh you're right. I forgot Chronobunker was using it. I'm assuming that's mostly what they were looking at. Still frustrating but oh well.
---
is it really true that without Glyph of empowerment was the reason druids were still used in fractals? will it be gone from 5 man content now? if so what class that isnt revenant can be used as support without a rotation like dps classes have?
---
I think its because they also buffed them in areas, while nerfing the most cancer parts.
---
They now have more CC, traded off for  neutering more aids builds like chronobunker.
---
&gt; In the case of revenant elite specializations, we felt that the herald and renegade didn't necessarily need trade-offs. Instead, we felt that the core revenant was missing something. 
---
FUCKING
---
THANK
---
YOOUUUUUUU
---
Now I have to choose between having 30k health or having 5% lifesteal on everything.
---
Check website gw2efficiency. You get crafting order, prices of mats, what you have vs what you need to buy, makes you shopping list, show you when elements are easier to buy than to craft and MUCH more.
---
Praise Joko
---
&gt; Guard: nothing much changed, mostly hammer changes
---
...what? only one of the changes is hammer related
---
I might go back to my elementalist for a while, I’ve always liked dagger main hand and these changes seem interesting.
---
So is Rifle DE just not good for most situations, not in terms of damage but playability. From what i have seen its like ANet just didnt do that good of a job with it
---
I don't think people denied that they did buddy.
---
The argument is on whether they should, not if they do or not.
---
you mean the build that's been overpowered (in all gamemodes) since its inception?
---
So, they bring up that the Scrapper has no downside, and then they don't give the Scrapper a downside.
---
I welcome more Shredder Gyro buffs. I've always liked the theme of the skill.
---
Another reduction in unique buffs with the removal of Glyph of Empowerment. Makes sense with their changes overtime to such buffs, though I would have easily accepted adding such a buff to another profession at some point instead. I just like having multiple options.
---
Interesting change to Ventari and Salvation for Revenants. I don't often run my healing build, but I may check it out once more when these changes hit.
---
Aside from the various welcome quality of life changes, the change I'm most excited about is to Berserker. I love playing power dual-axe Berserker with Rage skills already so I'll be very eager to check the new Berserk mode mechanics out.
---
It still outranges almost every melee attack in game, talk about overdramatic lmao
---
I imagine those will still be there.  It doesn't say anywhere that Daredevil is losing its F2 ability, like it does for Berserker.
---
I like chrono and I'm fine with rene, outside of pressing f4 there are plently of utility options and variations you can do, imcluding even going memestrel ventari, if group needs a dedicated healer. 
---
It is just we are yet again moving to  having a single, obviously superior composition. Why.
---
Sounds like we agree. Not sure if you care about fractals, but I expect to see firebrigade to be much more common now, where before there was still some people holding onto the legacy comp.
---
Welcome back to the game Tempest.
---
At this point I can no longer tell if you're actually narcissistic and uninformed or if you're just a trolling account or parodying others on the sub :V
---
You're not the only person who saw that ad. You are part of their target demographic, but you are not the only person in it.
---
While it's true that marketing campaigns can be expensive (and sometimes even take up a greater portion of a budget than actual development), it is the only way to expand your potential reach to a new audience. Word of mouth only gets you so far, sometimes you have to actively try to get the attention of a market. It is highly unlikely ArenaNet has blown their budget on a campaign that likely didn't take more than a month to set up. It is highly unlikely it is the reason for recent layoffs, especially in light of the news that they had several other projects/games they were working on which are now on indefinite hold.
---
[What's a troll?](https://soundcloud.com/user-19077365/the-truth)
---
Rev has fine DPS already anyways; every single class in this game is way past the minimum threshold to do any of the content with ease. This one should be interesting in PvP with the potential to burst through with even more unblockable attacks
---
Pointing out the bad things means that the other things not pointed out were ok/good. Plus how else is he supposed to learn if everyone says that the video is perfect.
---
What Mesmer boon spread?
---
Absolute madlad, window management is aces!
---
It means there was at most only 1 mod who didn’t like it ;\^)
---
really good job, maybe you can do a cut to bring it to normal length
---
Thief is already borderline useless in every game mode, why are you nerfing it without compensation?
---
ANY thief nerf is completely unjustified with the state the class currently is in.
---
Druid is already useless in every game mode not raids, the nerfs to the spec are also unjustified. It will probably be useless in every single game mode next patch.
---
&gt; On top of that, it can allow them to stretch into other minor areas of the world without having to commit to a full open-world map or raid.
---
I think you're missing the value of this point. There's always value in fleshing out the environment of the story. Raids do this, but do it behind a wall many players find daunting. Fractals, while they can be relevant to the story (Twilight Oasis comes to mind), they don't exist as a side-adventure in the "real world" that can elaborate on minor threads that actually exist in the world.
---
Fractals have a ton of creative freedom, but I think that means ANet is pretty unwilling to make them grounded in the main story. And why should they? That's not what fractals are about.
---
So I'd say there is worth to having in-world proper dungeons that allow for minor arcs to explore here and there along the way. Even really small ones can be fun and charming, as shown by the Secret Lair of the Snowmen during Wintersday. Like really tiny raids or something.
---
The point is that Fractals can't cover everything. There are still ways to make "dungeon dungeons" properly unique.
---
oh, i just noticed that rev centaur bubble apparently didn't get changed or forgotten
---
But they nerfed mesmer too, what are you talking about?
---
Is swipe going to be any useful anywhere in pve?
---
Awesome idea. 
---
Would love to discuss about it, i'll add you in a hour.
---
&gt;Also is that a 15% damage mod on Havoc Specialist when endurance is empty?
---
Yes. And you need to maintain at only one Endurance bar in order to get the current benefits. It's a nice risk-reward change that ties in beautifully with the specialization's name.
---
Guard sword buff, hell yeah. Wondering what kinda impact the right-hand strength changes are gonna have.
---
Mesmers only useless days in large scale were after confusion changes and before focus party started. 
---
So if my memory serves me right, about a year?
---
Ofc now its been useless for half a year already.
---
awesome, thanks for the good work!
---
Yeah since november there is none
---
It's more for clarity and streamlining skill descriptors. Too many keywords with similar meaning can be confusing, and this is likely their attempt at cleaning up.
---
 I fear it'll be this. Wanted this outfit, but I am not holding my breath :(
---
Hm. We nearly have the same setup, though I have a 1060 6GB in lieu of your 390.
---
I have everything maxed except shadows, character limit and and post processing are at their lowest, and I still get ~30 nearly everywhere and 100+ in instanced content.
---
I'm not sure if turning off shadows would make a noticeable difference, but it's something worth checking out.
---
Thank you. I i appreciate your support :)
---
It's going to be useful in most of the same ways steal is now?  Unblockable doesn't add much in PvE but the range isn't as big a deal either.  Sure, a bit of a loss, but not major compared to some drastically improved traits.
---
........
---
The point is not whether he hits max benchmarks. The point is to look at the relative differences between rabid and viper. Feel free to rebut with your own benchmarks.
---
Yea I spaced when I wrote my comment and forgot about Chronobunker using it. Definitely agree. Was more concerned about the other builds that use it. But it's still kind of sad that it will likely be useless as a weapon again.
---
 Would have been cool if there was some way to nerf it depending on the offhand or spec instead of just a flat 50% nerf into oblivion.
---
god's work
---
Old Grace of the Land will be waiting you there friend.
---
ah yes it seems I put the comment on the wrong part of the tree, sorry about that
---
https://gw2efficiency.com/
---
Mitch Conner?
---
Hmm, mine is still in the game. Maybe try repairing your client.
---
Exhausted after a week of work and read the first sentence as
---
    Elite specializations were introduced with the Heart of Thorns™ expansion and have become regular shit throughout
---
You got free 10% damage though, whats not to like?
---
Druid with 5 spirits is now the only way. Such gameplay.
---
I know, the NPC is using stealth.
---
*Necromancers have some solid roles right now across each game type. With this update, we're touching on a few core weapon abilities whose functionality had not been updated in a long time.*
---
And yet, still no dagger changes.  I'm pretty sure necro dagger still has the aftercast delay they removed from thief years ago.  Wouldn't know for sure since I haven't touched necro dagger in ages.
---
Pretty good changes all around.  The warrior changes in particular are huge, though I'm concerned that the rotation will consist of spamming decap.  Handful of QOL changes for necro, guardian and engy.  Interested to see how healing rev will turn out.  Druid's probably gone, at least in 5-man content, and it was already not a great choice there.
---
Everytime they say something like "touching on a few core weapon abilities whose functionality had not been updated in a long time" for necro I hope it's either dagger damage numbers or staff #1 projectile being updated and it never is. Hope the focus change is good though
---
great one!
---
&gt; It's really weird how excited GW2 fans are to see traditional advertisements for this game. 
---
Why are you even in the sub? Legit question.
---
&gt; I do have some sweet karma though, 670K, does that make me rich?
---
https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/karma
---
Btw with like half hour of play every day (multiple times few minutes), you can get 2 gold for dailies, 2-3 gold for timegated crafting, 2x 1.5 gold for VB and AB Amalgamated Gemstone (each needs 1-2 mins of time). Which is 7 gold with almost no effort at all.
---
Plus all the laurel and mystic coins login rewards. Every 4 weeks you get 55 [laurels](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/laurels) (which is currently worth 42+ gold), plus 20 mystic coins which currently gives almost 23 gold profit.
---
All in all, even if you do nothing else in the game than those quick dailies, every 4 weeks you get at least 261 gold with the current prices.
---
&gt;Gyros can now be used underwater.
---
If the Shredder Gyro doesn't proc Water combos on its own, imma riot.
---
And yet no one seems to mind them getting replaced by rev....which brings a unique buff as well. Why is one okay, but not the other?
---
Deadeye's Mark keeps those, but isn't steal and has its own set of skills.
---
Who's to say swipe won't be similar? Nobody can say, and I feel if it kept Steal's functionality, Anet would have said.
---
I’ve wanted berserker to work this way for a long time, can’t wait to see how this turns out
---
Yeah I am surprised they haven't nerfed the durations of Moa and Dolyak Stance already. I think they are either ignoring them in WvW for now, or they keep them in a halfhearted attempt to make Soulbeast desirable in zergs due to stanceshare but it hasn't worked.
---
Hmm very interesting changes to rev, going in the right direction, however I don’t like what they did with punishing sweep, they should have kept the daze and I really hope they add it back.
---
Also missed opportunity with buffing staff 4, should have the healing increased and should remove more conditions.
---
Furthermore we need buffs on the revs heal skills on the core legends. Currently for power rev the only sustain is via the glint heal skill, if you don’t have that you couldn’t sustain a single fight because all other heal skills are bad, this forces you (in pvp) to always use herald instead of core or renegade, that’s why you‘ll never ever see a renegade in pvp (atleast not in top tier)
---
i made a forum post that is exactly adressing this issue and yes you could but you would have to waste a utility for it and thats bad im playing oneshot daredevil in spvp so i need assassins signet. I know that im pretty much the only one playing that in spvp but it is like a hit in the face
---
The interesting thing is how you need your utility slots for rage skills to extend berserk, so it's not going to play nice with banners.  Maybe that gives them room to make it a real DPS build though?
---
Repeatable farm means that you can run it over and over unlike once daily farms like istan or bosses like Tequatl. If no one is leading a RIBA farm you could always tag up and run it yourself as I have.
---
These are new ads regardless, which I think was the point of the post.
---
Berserker is sounding pretty nice.

None of what you've said is necessarily relevant. The point is not the accuracy of the benchmarks in an absolute sense ("can these numbers still be achieved with these builds"). The point is that it is a benchmark allowing you to see a percentage difference between viper and rabid.
---
Do you have a more updated one? Feel free to link it, I am always interested in theorycrafting and would love to see. Otherwise it seems as if you're simply criticizing any aspect of the benchmarks that can be criticized, regardless of whether the aspect in question changes the calculus of viper v. rabid, in blind defensiveness.
---
Same issue here since the lastest version I think. Gonna try 1.1.0 back again.
---
Still very much meta in raids but a soulbeast can be the one taking Frost spirit in fractals. It has been this way for quite a while where the better groups don’t have a need a healer but the pug groups want one.
---
&gt; Not sure why the pets weren't touched overall, given that many of the most recent pet nerfs were due to druids excess of power… 
---
Yeah, particularly Iboga. I miss tearing through Open world with that little guy.
---
you not playing much game modes do you? XD
---
"Soul Eater: It no longer reduces greatsword-skill recharge by 20%." This is a massive nerf to what is already the slowest executing weapon in the game. What absolute bullshit!
---
I'm so hyped for these Berserker changes someone pls pinch me
---
Very nice work! (The only thing I like about GoT is the intro, so appreciated xd)
---
DR got like 10 times the attention than other cities though ;D Also I got a bit nauseous from all that camera circling from the 2nd half of Rata Sum to the 1st half of Hoelbrak.
---
What does HL mean?
---
In any case, you'll do fine with either spec; Reaper will be better at Power damage builds, and as a result *slightly* better in PvE open world and story missions. Scourge is better in a group setting, and is the better condition damage spec between the two.
---
In WvW, Scourge will be the better choice in zergs; you *could* roam with Reaper but you'll likely have a tough time against better roam classes, and Reaper won't outperform Scourge in zergs.
---
In general:
---
=
---
Open world - reaper
---
Instanced PvE - scourge
---
WvW - scourge
---
But it entirely depends on what you want to use. I personally prefer reaper because it's more fun for me, but some may find scourge more fun. It all depends on what you want to play.
---
why would anyone be excited for ads? especially when they look like some age of empire mobile shit ads
---
Thank you :)
---
that is true. honestly just find it much more fun to play druid and likely wont bother playing if i cant do t4 fractals easily if people dont want me. i cant get into many raid groups since i havent gotten a ton of li.
---
I'm not entirely sure it's better than Decimate Defenses but that might be because I don't have enough precision.
---
Shadows are one of the most complex things to calculate, so turning off shadows should make a difference, but by how much, you'll have to try and see.
---
Reaper is better with viper gear... And it's fun as hell. One of my favorite builds.
---
Yeah its a bit of a downgrade in pve but still usable.
---
The map-chat (/m, red colour) ist for your current borderland, the team-chat (/t, dark red) ist for all borderlands (including OS and Armistic Bastion). 
---
In the chat options (sprocket on the left top of the chat window) you can activate the channel tags, then you can see where the team-chat message is comming from (e.g. RBL for the red border land).
---
Then they should start buffing the other aspects of the druid's kit to put it on par with other healers. Renegade can give alacrity, unique spirit effects, and projectile blocking; firebrand can give quickness, aegis, stab, and projectile blocking; scourge gives barrier and has the best rezzes in the game; tempest has some of the best raw heals. Idk what scrapper has going for it. 
---
Meanwhile, they just keep nerfing druid so that it doesn't have much more going for it than power, fury, and heavily-nerfed spirits.
---
Joko, we know that's you.  Don't get salty just because we used the 'Hungry Dragon' stomp before you could rez.
---
I may even play it now on my main!
---
That's only part of it; they also serve based on a genre/field of interest. Say, for instance, Anet purchased ads for "MMORPG" or "Fantasy RPG" keywords (including but not limited to names of games), the ads could serve to someone who plays WoW and never heard of / played GW2. It could even serve those ads for people looking at games like Dark Souls, The Witcher, Darksiders, etc.
---
They could even target under the general umbrella of "Fantasy" to reach out to fans of Fantasy in other mediums such as tv shows or movies.
---
What I'm getting at is that of course we're more likely to see posts on this sub made here about ads — we're already fans. It doesn't mean that existing players are the only ones being served, only that we're the most likely to *talk about the ads*. To everyone else, it's just an ad. Either it grabs your attention or it doesn't, and you move on.
---
I left GW2 a little over 2 years ago and I'm looking to come back, so im out of the loop. What's happening?
---
As someone who occasionally hangs out in LFG, helping people: the amount of story instances with special mechanics for guests is surpsiring.
---
Hi! I'm interested in joining on Guardian! Currently away from my computer for Easter weekend and cant remember my acc name.. but will message in-game or wherever when I get back :&gt;
---
I guess they are gonna keep hitting druid with nerfs until players accept the fact that other healers are also viable. ANet wants to change the meta the hard way. And I don't blame them.
---
Hi, thanks for the heads up. Appreciated. :)
---
I believe that these are not PvE Mesmers.  Ask yourselves this, why would mesmers want their portals nerfed? These activities are from others who DO NOT "normally" play mesmer.
---
If I'm not around, I'll be around tomorrow!
---
I've seen several change now with the Thief skill, Repeater. Is that really a good skill now? I would totally make a character with just a pistol.
---
 Anet is powerless against PvP Wintrading Clans
---
I don't see in any way Tempest coming back with those changes!? Am i missing something?
---
Tempest can do 10 man might, the spirits are from ranger, not from druid.
---
You sound like a person who enjoys non-sequiturs and strawman arguments.
---
Had no idea you celebrated it every year, Well happy hot save to you! May your grinds be not in vain.
---
Except people have widely accepted other healers already, just that druid remains as the first healer, while other options are taken as a second healer.
---
And ANet isn't changing the Meta the hard way, just making it less and less enjoyable to play the Class. Pretty much the same thing they did/are doing to Chrono. Everything that even vaguelyneeds skill on the Supportclasses gets removed.
---
I barely trust my eyes, a Salvation update! And with orb mechanics!
---
I asked for this thing like two years or more ago. 
---
Well fuck me silly, what will they do now to surprise me? Reverse Renegade shortbow #3 to the beta bug?
---
I am so bummed by the Druid thing. I feel like Druid isn’t even close to the best healer, and with recent changes I think team comps won’t ever use one. If they need healing, they’ll swap out a dPS for a healing Ele
---
Ahh, yes. Vanilla HoT. Sat down and went grinding for three days straight to finish all the initial masteries. Veteran spiders, CoF, all the boosters. Good times, good times.
---
Tempest gets much longer CDs if they use OLs.  That's the tradeoff for tempest.
---
Reapers onslaught grandmaster trait.  300 ferocity while in shroud.
---
since the new level of communication and work that is put again into gw2 i have some hope that it will happen
---
i dont think so, since unblockable is a thing.  
---
if projectiles are destroyed, unblockable ones are also destroyed. now they won't be destroyed and hit you, even with swirl up for example.  
---
or was this the case before also already?
---
Free shared inventory slot!  More dungeon rewards!  Whats not to like.
---
This reminded me of the yellow bird from Angry Birds xD
---
[Was it that hard](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=gw2+shrine+maiden+outfit).
---
Not a chance.
---
Got a problem with RP?
---
Weird, my link also works but ty :D
---
If they make us pay for episodes or whatever, they better make it worth the money
---
Look on CPU load, GPU load and adjust settings accordingly.
---
if GPU load is high - shaders, shadows, textures, sampling, antialiasing
---
if CPU load is high - shadows, character limit, environment
---
Note that you should look at per core CPU load!
---
That would be interesting to see :D
---
\&gt;&lt;
---
No, you aren't.  But it is better to stay positive!
---
"Season Pass" has a very negative connotation whenever it's used, and it's going to leave a very sour note for anyone that hears/reads it.
---
If it's just a story and mounts, no. If it comes with gameplay features (i.e. specializations), yes.
---
Leads to this page:

---
Might work with RES, but without it, you needed to put the escape character `\` so that the `)` wouldn't be interpreted as closing the Markdown hyperlink syntax.
---
&gt; oh no, this trait is too strong. should we improve the alternatives? nah, just shred the good trait!
---
&gt; it keeps happening.
---
yes, because that's how you properly balance a game.
---
constantly improving alternatives so they match with the dominant elements is a vicious cycle called *power creep* and it's the first thing you learn to avoid when balancing a game.
---
Heart of Thorns aged amazingly well. Dare I say better than PoF and the base game. And it was all thanks to this update. (Along with HoT's own epic open meta event designs)
---
I only hope next expansion is more like HoT.
---
Hopefully it only takes a small team to improve rewards across the board, change enemy scaling, and a few extra events here and there
---
Yes, I would.
---
I have to say I'm baffled by the removal. GoE was well past the point where it was overpowered, it was merely keeping druid relevant. Without it what is druid? A zero-damage, low-healing might-stacker with spotter. In fractals where precision basically doesn't matter why would you ever run druid over the other options?
---
My face flew off when I read these changes. I'm still trying to find it.
---
Gonna rename my character garen and spam demacia in chat while cutting enemies down with my spinning greatsword
---
The repeater buff also has some nice synergy with the Shadow Strike change from the previous patch, allowing you to spam it during the window it's available without burning through all your Initiative.
---
I would, but overall it would be bad for the game.
---
I'd pay for an expasnion pack. Which I have been doing... If that's not good enough anymore, they should let me know, so I can invest my money elsweyr.
---
Beta 1.9 is totally fine and the newest version. All releases except the major releases like 1.0 and the upcoming 2.0 are usually in beta or alpha state, because i lack the time to bugtest every little thing
---
No. I would not.
---
i hope they fix the animations in a year's time at the very least. its been too long for an overhaul of some of the absolute worst animations ive ever seen in a game, the way human, sylvari, and norn males swing one handed things in general, the absolute goofiness that is norn running at the same pace as asura. this axe animation for sure. even the new mounts have animation problems right from the start like when you mount the skimmer, it doesnt even try to connect to the idle stance, it just warps like a glitchy unfinished animation would. most of the animations in this game are very fluid and pleasing but the ones that arent \*\*REALLLLLLLY\*\* arent and its been like that since launch unfortunately
---
That's a hard pass from me.  I'm happy to pay for expansions, but I don't want to see LW seasons get monetized like that.
---
Woooo as power shatter mesmer since day 1, I'm glad to see some love. I definitely thinks there's a lot of mesmer traits and utilities that needs rework because they aren't as useful, not even situational. I'm glad that there's development on that side. I also wish there's another main hand for power besides a sword.
---
Wow these improvements are fucking dope. Keep it going, this is a step in the right direction.
---
&gt; In addition to all the things I’ve talked about here, this update includes a large series of improvements to Fractals and PvP, plus a full balance update for skills, **a new legendary short bow**
---
Is this a typo by any chance? Why short bow and not GS?
---
This will be third short bow and GS was the last weapon from second generation that we didn't got.
---
Repeater is also on P/D, if you hit someone with the stab on the 3 it turns into repeater.
---
its a three year old post
---
Still no Dragonhunter Bow changes...
---
Team chat also includes players from same server on EotM maps.
---
I 100% agree. I still feel bad for shitting on Colin and his direction for the game. Years later its still my favorite part of the story as well as repeatable content that I play. Sad that we were all so excited to go to the desert in PoF and when we got there all we found was a desert of content
---
Nothing and Anet would never do this what they have now is good log in once and its free if you don't log in during the episodes release e.g. 2-3 months or till the next update then you need to pay.
---
Considering how long it took me to max out my HoT masteries, no thank you
---
and I wipe my butt with _______ .
---
Didnt they just say that for season 5, they are looking at not making a new map for every episode but let some of them play on already existing maps?
---
They changed some traits that are typically used by reapers (at least in pve). You now get something like 300 ferocity while in shroud from grandmaster traits in soul reaping and reaper trees. This means you can cast stuff like WH5, GS4, and wells, pop into shroud, and now they have 600 (ish, I think) bonus ferocity, which is quite a big boost.
---
Heal glyph healing output got increased a lot. A lot of skills affect 10 people as well.
---
Sadly you dont use bolas and kick for their utility but for the peak performance buff.
---
Unblockable projectiles can't be blocked or destroyed (try with Basi Venom or Ranger Warhorn 5). Big diference here is probably that now you can get the effect for "on block" runes/traits/etc.
---
meta on 3 bosses in raids, has not seen any gameplay in fractals for ages and welp, we dont talk about dungeons these days.
---
I think they could get away with reintroducing into the game under some other name and for some other rewards purpose. They may as well since they developed them already right? They aren't all necessarily terrible, but they were bad for something that was supposed to be a prestige and unique set to sPvP/Wvw
---
Lol, ‘balance changes.’ Anything involving the word ‘balance’ from Anet is a joke. Maybe if i was a new player I’d be optimistic, but let’s be real.
---
pSlB swaps the poison stance for Frost IIRC, for little personal DPS loss.
---
Read the article
---
Hm yes, that's true, I copy/pasted that a bit too fast.
---
I think spirit weapons being ground target will maybe help keep some enemies from drifting out of the bone zone during traveling combat, but I super don't like the idea of the extra inputs it's going to add to my regular rotation. Meh.
---
I am still using Version 1.0.3 because I like that one a lot. If I get the new version and happen to like the old one better, I can just go back to the old one, right? ♥ Anyways, thanks for all your hard work!
---
Wow... they noticed Rampage, but in the way I didn't expect them to change. Sooo they really think this skill is balanced and is fine as it is? Good to know, at least they are clear about it.
---
Good point! And this is awesome to hear!
---
So it is possible!?! Awesome :O
---
awwwwww-wwwwwwwwwwwwwww it's soooooo long.  summarize it all in one word
---
Not gonna touch this with a 10 foot pole.
---
...streamlined?
---
Even that isnt really true. Thief is only "the best" (even then its not by much, other classes are still really good) on Samarog and Qadim, and in Qadims case its mostly the fact that thieves can kite that encounter. Which, with these changes they cant.
---
How i see the new berserker playstyle. 
---
https://www.deviantart.com/king-salomo/art/Mega-Gnar-504651876
---
Yes, this is what they said. Which was the exact feedback the community has been giving for a while, so I guess it was nice to read.
---
&gt; RIP Raid Druids.
---
Another patch, another comments like this one.
---
People still forget that spirits/spotter exist and druid's the best at might stacking.
---
I mean Staff Mastery is now 240 power boost with a staff completely passive, that alone is a significant boost. Havoc Mastery is now for non-staff DDs.
---
it's viable now. it's just very selfish
---
I trait the bring downed to you and some metas it seems like i spend more time rezzing ppl from downed state than dpsing.  (Looking at you DB Shatterer.)
---
agree, but autoattack may need some attention imho
---
or a proper purpose for marks effect, is it a condi weapon? a power weapon? just a stick to poke stuff aoe and get some little effects? keeping the skills as they are but tuning up damage to make it a power weapon, or tuning it down and adding some conditions to make it usable in condi builds wouldnt be bad.
---
If you also trait your healing well in the Blood Magic traitline then you can drop both your healing well and the one that procs from ressing to quickly auto-res a lot of people.
---
Eh, its 240 power instead of the previous 10% damage multiplier. Based on Dagger Trainings results, Im pretty sure thats a pretty steep damage loss (And why you still will go for Havoc Mastery anyway).
---
One thing that'll be interesting though for Power Berserker.  Which Rage skills do you take, and which Physical skills do you take for Peak Performance to proc?
---
WTF is that thing...?
---
If they put in a season pass, they can tout how well they listen to the community when they subsequently take it out.
---
I agree on guardian. Aegis let's you get in, farm, and on to next as long as there is only one hit.  Plus, focus 5 gets you a bonus 3 blocks if you use it first when getting there.
---
Amalgamated Gemstone for daily PoF metas... done.
---
This is my concern, too -- particularly the shortened range on lightning whip. I have actually always liked dagger mainhand on ele, but forcing the squishiest class in the game to hug the enemy even tighter in order to do good damage (and being able to do good damage is supposed to be the tradeoff for being squishy -- glass cannon and all) seems counter-intuitive.
---
The only upside I can see to a shorter range on lightning whip is making it easier to tell where you need to be in order to actually do damage with it. The animation is so laughably awkward that it took me a long time of playing my ele to be able to know where the range is instinctively without having to double-check if I'm actually hitting or not. Now newbies don't have to guess -- they can just assume they have to snuggle the enemy.
---
Interesting changes overall, though. I'm eager to try them out and see how it actually feels!
---
&gt; big nerfs likely for condi berserker
---
You do realize that condi berserker will get to stay in berserk for almost twice as long now, right? Needing to spend less than 1s casting berserk (which deals damage and applies burning) every 39s is not a "big nerf"...
---
True, they dont have to provide anything, but its still a bonus. And while thief hypothetically is (with Rifle, but few play it due to its unreliability and complicated nature), Daredevil isnt. Daredevil is outclassed by anywhere upwards of 3 other classes (if we include bigger hitboxes which quite often there are, its actually 5 classes that simply do more damage while also being useful). And thats without getting into the problem with Daredevil not meshing well with some fractals and instabilities, and the fact that its already not terribly reliable. And this is a nerf, and a pretty steep one at that. I wouldnt be surprised to see thief go from number 4 to number 7 or 8.
---
Those were just asura. Yes, they're little and a bit strange, but some of them are quite friendly.
---
But really tho yes its the most recent skin for skimmer - a hummingburd!
---
Ads mean more players and more revenue and more improvements to the game

You're correct, with that hardware you should be able to run the game much better. Do other games run without problems?
---
There are a few traits that interact with blocking. like Guardian’s Amplified Wrath (burn enemy on block) and Might of the Protector (gain might on block). We’ll have to see if these traits actually work though, they may refer specifically to blocking with aegis.
---
Yup, and this Initiative change seems to show that you can likely spam Repeater for the full window while it's open to stack up decent Bleed.
---
Slaughter them all and leave nothing left
---
No but i would pay for expansions.
---
See, we're working from different priors here.  Daredevil is top or near top DPS on most power-focused raid bosses.  It has one of the highest power golem benchmarks, and has a fairly easy and safe pattern that is easy to execute.  It did not need to capture a full 5% buff to its peak performance.
---
I figure you're thinking about CM fractals, which are much more heavily focused on AoE and burst damage than single target DPS.  You're right that staff didn't need a shave there, as it doesn't have a lot of PvE-style burst damage.
---
Still, with the auto shave you're looking at closer to a 3.5% peak performance buff and a 1.5% shave if you play it safe - numbers that aren't going to alter things wildly.
---
Efficiency will give you a map to resource nodes. The wiki is a wiki and  [http://gw2crafts.net/](http://gw2crafts.net/)  will give you the cheapest/fastest path from 1 - 500 crafting
---
Nah it's the worst, kiting is one of the best things about pvp and helps enable more off-meta builds. If you liked this map for that reason that much and dislike that there's more kite spots then odds are you get kited by players better at the game than you and don't like that.
---
The bonus damage from the new weakening strike is balanced by the loss of damage given by the old havoc mastery, so no net change there.
---
I'd wager /u/GeneralHavok is talking about the mainhand Dagger changes.  Tempest is already about PBAoE support, so the Dagger tweaks give it more of a PBAoE damage ability as well.
---
I dont see why not. We Necros got our minion to be an undead shark after all
---
Like honestly LW season maps are already such saturated market that only insentive to buy would be new meta stats from new maps, witch intern making GW2 p2w... no shitstorm afterwards...
---
To be fair, it being Unblockable means that one trait that makes Steal inflict Daze can interrupt channeled blocks.
---
is that pic actually something from the game?
---
Never underestimate people's ability to screw up the simplest things, eh?
---
The thing is that druid has carried so much unique, passive group buffing for so long that it's necessitated nerf after nerf after nerf.  If there's an upside to burying GoE, it's that dialing that back further opens up power budget for things that ideally have some skill expression.
---
In the meantime though it's a character that's both unsatisfying and not terribly good outside of buffing an entire raid passively, and that is something that'll need to be addressed.
---
240 power is effectively a 6% modifier. That’s a strict nerf from the old 10% trait.
---
I deeply hate this. Reaper's touch was one of my favourite abilities. It was interesting to have it ricochet, and you could pop into shroud to give it extra damage from your traits, and now they're changing it to just "press button for damage." I thought one of their core design philosophies was not to do that?
---
Whenever I try to launch an account it tries to patch for some reason? I'm fully patched, so not sure what's going on
---
I hyped to see all these tradeoffs.  I strongly believe elite specializations should always lose or replace something to make them different from the core profession, not just getting something added on top.  
---
Other than not being able to bring 3 core specializations, that is. 
---
With berserker, revenant and druid getting tradeoffs, that leaves only 4 missing trade-offs:
---
* Engineer - Scrapper
---
 * Scrapper could use a profession mechanic that is more widely useful in more of PvE since the you do not usually need to finish enemies in PvE, and you don't need to revive anyone if everyone is doing their job properly.  For example, replacing the Scrapper's F5 toolbelt skill from the elite skill with an "Action Gyro" that stays over the other shoulder of the engineer, and lunges at enemies to deal damage, and that has a bonus functionality and gains charges based on the selected Scrapper Grandmaster trait: 
---
 * Action Gyro: Deals damage on target enemy, maximum count of 3 charges.
---
     * Adaptive Armor: Action Gyro gains a charge whenever the scrapper loses 33% of their base health, Action Gyro gives barrier to self and allies around the enemy.
---
     * Kinetic Stabilizers: Action Gyro gains a charge whenever the scrapper interrupts an enemy, strikes target enemy with a dazing lightning strike. (plus Final Salvo's own effects, of course)
---
     * Applied Force: Action Gyro gains a charge whenever Applied Force triggers, and it is now an Explosion, a blast finisher, and gives might to allies.
---
This way, core F5 skills could be greatly improved as they'd be exclusive to core engineer. 
---
* Soulbeast
---
 * Soulbeast can't use their pets while merged, but their pet mechanic is identical while not in beastmode. So it's an addition, not a tradeoff.  Reducing pet stats would be a bad idea for an elite specialization more meant to do DPS, but since beastmode heals the pet when leaving, that's basically like having an extra pet swap. With that in mind, their tradeoff could be a longer pet recharge on defeat as they have two skills to keep the pet from dying, making it riskier.  
---
But going too high over 60s would be a a tad too long for pet recharge, so instead core ranger could have their pet recharge on death reduced to just 25-45s, while soulbeast and druid would have 60-75s recharge for their pet, and that would help newbies get their pet back sooner as they level up in core maps.  
---
 * Another possibility is giving core ranger an F5 skill that does something that isn't spectacularly strong, but at least unique. For example, using F5 as core ranger could make both your pets do 'tag-combo' attack. You use F5, the other pet appears, both pets use their pet skills, and the pets swap places, like the tag-combo attacks in games like Capcom vs Marvel.
---
* Mesmer x2
---
 * Mesmers don't lose anything when specializing. Since their shatters represent "power", "condi", "CC" and "tank", maybe they could get a 5th could be "utility", maybe they could get a core F5 skill that does something like creating a clone with your alternate weapon set instead with the current, or that shuffles their location with a random clone.  
---
Then Chronomancer would replace it, and mirage lose it.
---
LB waits until a character is fully started now in order to make all settings work. SO if you have two way authentication on, you still have to enter all that information by yourself, after that it will proceed normaly
---
&gt;  is it a condi weapon? a power weapon?
---
its a back up/support/utility weapon, akin to thief shortbow
---
&gt; keeping the skills as they are but tuning up damage to make it a power weapon
---
Thanks! Will do that. :D
---
 * Mesmers don't lose anything when specializing. Since their shatters represent "power", "condi", "CC" and "tank", maybe they could get a 5th that would be "utility", a core-only F5 skill that does something like creating a clone with your alternate weapon set instead with the current, or that shuffles their location with a random clone.  
---
This was probably about PvE rotations. So you would cast WH 5 before going into shroud and get the bonus ferocity on Locust Swarm ticks.
---
Cool, I wasn't aware of the pattern.  I was gone for quite a while.  Thanks!
---
I successfully logged onto my account + character fully loaded but the prompt stays opened after I close the client window. Whenever I click on "Cancel" sometimes it would crash LB.
---
They are shitting on the game in every thread I see them in. Don't pay any attention to them, it's not worth it.
---
If you refer to SC benchmarks, you can stuff it. Classes that are higher than Daredevil are practically equal (difference ranging from whooping 5 dps to 1k, practically nothing in a real boss scenario and DD still gets more on average) or they are power Chrono/rifle Deadeye.
---
&gt; simply do more damage while also being useful
---
Horseshit. DD's loaded with CC and most of its steal skills is extremely strong. Weaver, condi Zerker and power Chrono do barely anything other than damage and Renegade's always energy-hungry. Only Firebrand is worth mentioning when it comes to usefulness, but you don't see every group stacking them.
---
Changes in the patch are a mixed bag, the only nerf is staff auto 1 and 2, there are also some buffs to traits. I'm maining thief and I outdps many other classes on any boss that doesn't require condis on regular basis, so I'm fairly sure thief is and will be one of the best dps classes even after the patch.
---
Love this!!!!!!
---
Wow this is exactly what I was looking for, thanks so much!
---
I have concerns that such a change would result in the death of HoT metas.
---
Well, youre right, its only slightly below them. Mind you, if you do the numbers on the new things, it falls over 1.5k under the others if you still play it reasonably safe. Specifically, chilling out at Core Condi Engies levels. Oh and as far as real boss scenarios go, looking over GW2 Raidars stats, looks like Daredevil actually performs worse in those than the other classes, with only a few exceptions. Not surprising really.
---
Power Chrono provides CC as well, but also has a pretty nasty reflect. Ontop of doing considerably more DPS. Firebrand also has its usefulness, and only Zerker and Weaver dont do anything useful. Zerker is truly just outclassed, but Weaver does just do far more damage than thief to still outclass it.
---
Theyre not a mixed bag. The staff nerf is the most obvious one, however, Havoc Mastery is also a nerf unless you go literally dodgeless (as in, you maintain 0 dodge bars outside of the dodge in your rotation). Specifically, if you maintain 2 dodge bars you lose 4% overall damage, 1 is 1.5% overall damage, and with 0 you gain a whooping 0.8% damage. Needless to say, the 0 dodge one is also just stupidly risky and not worth it. Even the 1 one is rather risky. So if you want to play like right now, expect to be doing about as much damage as the core engineer or the power soulbeast in your group.
---
That's just GW3
---
Whatever it takes to have broken mesmers. ANet manages to have strong mesmers in every patch and I've been playing since launch. What do I know though??
---
Y'all downvote like it's r/politics
---
They should be 100% healer. That's their whole point.
---
You know damage multipliers are also multiplicative right?
---
If you were always below full endurance before, staff master is 10%.  If you stay at lowest endurance after the changes, that'll be worth 15%.
---
1.15 / 1.10 = 1.04545
---
That's a net 4.5% increase before the AA change if you play it perfectly.
---
so 10.294 * 1.0455 = 10.762 compared to the 10.464 before the changes.  That's a 2.85% damage increase if you play it perfectly.
---
If you play it with 1 dodge in reserve at all times, you'd end up with a 1.62% nerf.
---
So this change is somewhere between a -1.62% and +2.85% depending on how well you manage your endurance.
---
If you didn't nerf the AA, you'd have a straight 4.55% buff on the expertly played version, which would push it up above everything other than rifle DE and Domination Chrono on the current DPS golem charts.
---
Damage multipliers in this game are multiplicative.
---
S-s-shut up!
---
Tell that to all the bunker builds in sPVP
---
Why would you think that an unblockable CC is irrelevant?
---
I've been away from the game for a while and I miss my old mesmer. I always hated shattering since 2012 launch. Is there any way to play a non-shatter mesmer anymore now that phantasms are just fancy clones? Doesn't need to be a super competitive build, I'm pretty casual.
---
That could only be name change. Not clear if it's a nerf as well.
---
That kind of re-leaunch would lead to months of non-development and such an high cost that it's much more profitable to just do a new project. And NCSoft doesn't want exactly that.
---
lol that's true, I do definitely trust that their recommendations are based on something solid  
---
I guess I should've been more specific in asking, because I'm wondering if it's worth flushing all those scholar runes when I'm a more average player. SC usually min-maxes as much as possible, with the best food and appropriate infusions. But personally, I'm not concerned with reaching the top tier, only with being a solid DPS. So I'm not sure if they chose thief runes to really keep pushing that damage, or because it's more or less a necessary part of the build now.
---
I mean there is only 5 Races and 8 Classes represented in the original image, meaning there will be overlap. As far as I can tell, both the Ranger and Thief are Sylvari.
---
As long as people make mistakes, they'll be thankful that the guy stacking 25 might for them can also heal, manage conditions, bring a decent amount of cc, and insta-res.
---
GW2 itself
---
GS 1 is a MASSIVE 8.08% of your damage on power reaper.
---
GS 3-5 make up 10.55%
---
PLAY THE GAME HOWEVER YOU WANT.
---
As long as you play and cater to the most casual players at all times, because anyhting else is toxic and elitist. How dare you make raid groups with decent players or run WvW groups that aren't a cloud of random gankers?!
---
Not nearly enough chin. Go back and do it again!
---
&gt; Zealot's Defense: Damage has been increased by 50% in PvE only. Fixed a  bug that caused some visual effects to display on the player when  enemies were hit 
---
Is ok, but I don't see myself using sword over greatsword on DH.
---
&gt; Right-Hand Strength: This trait no longer gives a flat critical-hit  chance. Instead it gives an additional 80 precision, plus an additional  80 power while wielding a one-handed weapon. 
---
It is basically a \~50% loss on critical-hit chance. How wonderful.
---
It's OK not to like RPGs, there  are plenty of other games you can play.
---
An example of different functionality is winds of disenchantment will now reflect projectiles when traited with shield mastery
---
All accounts get wiped and you have to pay another 50 bucks to start playing again.
---
What the hell.
---
I mean, not saying that stuff doesn't sound great - I'd kill to have all of it. But, at the rate we see new content and the amount we see in expansions? 
---
Yeah, no. 
---
I don't see it ever happening, and that's not just me being negative about ArenaNet's development pace or otherwise - this sort of thing is a massive undertaking that we don't see the likes of in any game, with the exception of maybe FFXIV going into A Realm Reborn and essentially relaunching the entire game (that was a much bigger project that might as well have equated to another game, though, which is why the stuff Teapot talks about here makes more sense for a GW3.)
---
yeah, Deadeye D/D is pretty good, but it's too dependent on conditions on foes and boons on you, so I was wanted D/D daredevil to be a thing, do you think that now with more general traits that might become reality?
---
Honestly, Scourge. Sure, Reaper comes ahead a bit in open world but Scourge is good pretty much anywhere else so might as well stick to that. Also condi gear is way cheaper anyway.
---
I mean you can still gather people and do most early parts of the metas with a small party if you have a tag. So casuals can still experience the smaller stages of the meta without reliance on a full map the entire time. This allows the maps to age well after people have completed achievements and collections they need, because no one is trying to spend 1 hour in the map for no reason.
---
Honestly all of underwater should automatically be a water combo field.
---
OMG Berserker changes ! I cant wait for that new arc divider, its finally the spin I've always wanted on warriors
---
The financial cushion is there *because* of Hearthstone. The engine overhauls occurred during financial declines of WoW *before the subsequent games were released*. Sometimes you have to spend money to make money, and that's where a company like ANet tends to falter (disregarding the engine overhaul discussion, this goes beyond that). Most game companies are businesses first. ANet has tried to break that trend (which it ironically didn't, because Blizzard originally wasn't a business first but when it became one, the ANet founders split off. ANet is not trying to be a business first, but NCSoft has been pushing them since before GW2 launched).
---
Additionally, a game that has been successful for 10 years and is no longer successful doesn't have that big of a cushion. Most of the money from the success goes back towards development. The development needs to be driven towards profit unless the company truly has a big enough cushion they don't care (see: Google). The remaining money doesn't stay as a "cushion", it goes to the executives as bonuses or raises.
---
Now you might say that, well, the money going back into development **is** the cushion. Sure, but when you're tasked with a subsystem and given a certain amount of money, that means you're given fairly strict constraints. Sure, most of the employees are salaried, so that means the money given isn't necessarily in terms of money, but in terms of work hours. So you have X amount of hours to complete this task. You will have a team of Y size, and yif you go over that, the money just isn't there and you're pulling into other project funds.
---
This happens in Blizzard, this happens in FFXIV, this happens in GW2. 
---
Now to your other point...  
---
&gt; GW2 has undergone minor engine re-works such as the removal of culling, but somehow, that's not really what people have in mind when they talk about an "engine re-work,"
---
Except, minor sub-systems, like culling, are natural in a game's progression. Technically any and all changes to the game are changes to the game's engine. Do we consider balance patches as important game engine changes? Not really. While they are necessary for the future of the game, they aren't improving how the game plays on machines. Additionally, specifically for culling, that doesn't end up helping optimization. It generally just means tweaking a few values in the back-end and then updating the way draw calls works (which, ironically, ends up slowing certain parts down). When a character gets loaded, it now loads the "base model" first, then it loads the specific items. Sure, adding one base model is not that heavy on your RAM, but the client now has to process when to make the switch, as well as it still suffering from not loading models when there are too many (ie culling) and the GPU (or, in this case, CPU, thanks DX9) chugging away to monitor, update, and output all the draw calls.
---
I'm going to switch to a more technical analysis here, as I do have a background in programming. DX9 has a fairly large overhead when ran. You can't really reduce this. It also shoves many of the calls to the CPU before the GPU, which defeats the point. The GPU is capable of handling many more calls than the CPU because it's just a sweatshop churning out what the foreman (CPU) tells it to. Ideally a game will send as many calls as possible to the GPU, specifically draw calls, to make use of it. The simplest way of doing that is to have multiple foremen each shouting at the GPU (it makes stuff really fast, many times faster than a foreman can shout). However, DX9 tends to be single core, as it was created before duocore, quadcore, and other multi-core solutions were fully adopted. This means that you generally have one foreman, but you can add more it's just more work and the original foreman has to yell at the other foremen, making it a bit redundant in most cases (and sometimes slower than just not running in parallel). The largest issues in terms of client performance with GW2 are it using CPU more than GPU (which can be fine, we have CPUs that are vastly powerful, but it isn't because...) and mainly one thread (running on a single core, which means that your sweet i9-9900K [this is a real processor] is only using **one** of it's 8 cores).
---
I'm metting the welcome back to gw2 event will lead up to the next episode.
---
Fuck no.
