There are lots of great stores in Reykjavik!

The cake is not a lie
---
I perfer etom over regular wvw maps to be honest but it got a sequence of nerfs
---
Because you would get given a guild that covers that timezone, that's the whole point of using playtime data while creating the alliance.
---
I’ve got my 6-0 skills also set to in order RTFGC. As well as my F1-F5 set to Shift+F1 etc.
---
My fondest wish for 500 jeweler is it unlocks a way to reset stats on any selectable asc trinket in the mystic forge, same as ascended weapons and armor.
---
/r/screenshotsarehard
---
How do you Get the recipe?
---
Does it count every buy ever on the account from gemstore or you need to buy it now to unlock it? I recieved that title today but i havent bought any items from gem store since like years as i just came back to playing again.
---
&gt; 2 people replied to the first comment. The other guy doesn't like heros. Nice statistic.
---

---
Let's say it wasn't a joke, for simplicity. I mean, it was, but let's pretend it wasn't to see if your response was still constructive.
---
(spoiler: it was not)
---
&gt;You saw the joke, I didn't. Congratulations. I bow down to you.
---
You could try not being petty and instantly rushing to correct people, that might help avoid the situation in the future, jokes or no jokes.
---
if anything there are way too many and should be reduced. The abundance of builds, while a good thing for older players and pretty much one of the strong points of the game (*or at least used to be*), increases the entry level for new ones and makes balancing a mess for the most part.
---
The guild wars was a historical event, that the game was named for. It's like saying Star Trek Deep Space Nine isn't on a trek because it's stationary.  It's an IP name. Every game in it isn't going to literally follow the IP name. 
---
Anyway I think you'd be surprised at the percentage of the Guild Wars 1 playerbase that never GvGed at all.
---
Oh totally - I was paraphrasing one of the memories he left for us. He said that "mine never arrived"
---
d/d celestial ele disagrees.
---
Aren't you doing the same? Correcting me, telling me what I did wrong?
---
Pretty good, a bit lower than what I see from DHs on VG. Dunno why you're showing me your logs though when I asked u/wheadna for his.
---
Picking up rabbit food does not have an alternative, though, - but, on the other hand, that's a much better way to teach you to dodge (compared to just reaching some lame chest)
---
where do you buy the recipe
---
"more effort for less output" seems to sum up engineer builds in general. I still like playing base condi engineer and I'm probably about 80% consistent with the rotation, but man does it feel awful still getting lower numbers than some of the easier condi rotations out there.  
---
Condi weaver is definitely an easier rotation in comparison. But it lacks the same fluid feeling as engineer so I don't play it much any more.
---
ye, obviously I do. sadly.
---
XD
---
Well, more importantly is how many people see my designs. If no one sees them, I can't get them excited by them.
---
I'd like to see that. Not sure what would be more impressive, doing it blind or like that.
---
Seems chaotic lol, maybe fun too.
---
lol poor Gandara...wtf
---
why couldn't they just pair together the same language-speaking servers?
---
Nah playa
---
Sounds cool, let me know how it goes or if you see anyone do this.
---
No need to buy a recipe, you should be able to discover it
---
I guess xD
---
Bigger maps take longer to complete. And combining maps takes rewards away from people who map complete. 
---
For a lot of people, map completion and it of itself is a thing. People use it to get mats, transmutation charges and the occasional black lion key. 
---
In my opinion this wouldn't make the game better.
---
Thanks. I'm genuinely considering gathering up all the comments over the last year from here and the Forums of people saying they want a Charr Rollercycle, just so I can prove to Anet that there is demand for it. My hope is they're already working on one, but I have no way of knowing for sure.
---
Fs in the chat boys.
---
This is really nice. Good job!
---
This is the dumbest and down right stupid answer I think I’ve ever seen on anything posted on the internet in my entire life time. 
---
You ordered a hockey stick. Instead arrived a T-shirt with a hockey stick printed on it. 
---
***The hockey stick is an historical event bleh blah bleeh blooh blah*** 
---
OP is right. I love the game but goddamn stop kissing arena nets sweet and innocent asshole. The more people who act like this, the more they can do whatever they want and ignore their community even further. Don’t encourage that as it’s already bad as it is.
---
I checked the wiki and some WvW features sound pretty good like the giant radar above a structure or the dragon banner but somehow I never those buffed dolyaks. Despite those buffs actively defending especially camps and towers doesn't seem worth it from what I experienced. Only roamers who are passing by try their luck in keeping enemies away. No one seems to care about desert bl. 
---
I can see why people do guild missions. Nice and easy, do stuff together for an hour. Get ascended trinkets.
---
5 gold to the first person who sends me a build with Bringer's stats. Expertise++ precision+ Vitality+.
---
Thanks. It would be nice if one day Anet found a way to tie-in a detail to the story that causes the mercantile district in LA to be knocked down and rebuilt like that. Maybe not destruction again, as that would be too predictable, but maybe if LA had a sudden massive boost in population or The consortium got kicked out. Maybe that could warrant knocking down the decor, and putting up some more infrastructure.
---
Yeah, I figured since some Charr players request wanting to be able to show off fur patterns (and Norn for Tattoos) without loosing the protection of a chest piece, that armour set would make sense. If they're going to be working hard, very possibly in hot conditions, then they would want to keep as some fur uncovered to avoid heat exhaustion, and it does give off the impression of toughness.
---
happens a lot. closing and re opening the window usually fixes it for me.
---
trading post is slow as fuck all the time
---
&gt;he ended his last one early after people kept pushing for it, and has been radio silent ever since.
---
About how long ago was that?
---
I've been wondering the same thing. I've been hoping he picks up the Let's Play again for LW2 and the rest up to current content. I want to hear his thoughts on some of the cool stuff we see in the later content.
---
I afraid I just blue myself
---
It is overloaded with transactions. A normal thing during larger events
---
Reminds me of Wakfu.
---
Here's something that might change your mind then:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars
---
From this page in the original wiki:
---
"The name of the series comes from the Guild Wars, a series of conflicts between Tyrian guilds which led to decline of humanity and allowing the charr to invade Ascalon, and other events of the first series of the games."
---
That's what the name of the series comes from. It's common knowledge. It's been known for years. You may not like the answer...but that's the answer.
---
How can quoting the wiki be a dumb answer?
---
.
---
[removed]
---
It happens, especially because sometimes you just reply directly from the mailbox rather than opening the thread. Happens to me, too.
---
I like WvW but have a lot of PVE goals to do still so mainly work on those. I do however do like 30imutes a day in WvW just helping any tags up, taking camps solo or various other things. It is not hard and as posted. Don't need to farm for 8 hours solid
---
join a GvG gui- oh wait. dead scene cause no support
---
I'm not a fan of snow biomes quite frankly, unless the music is really kicking. Like Phendrana Drifts in Metroid Prime or the snow levels in Goldeneye. Gimmie snow but gimmie chill music, too. Shiverpeaks themes on live right now make me sleepy instead....
---
BUT, that being said! I'm also looking forward to what they can do now 7 years later. Bitterfrost Frontier looked pretty good for a barren, white wasteland and they finally added a forest that actually felt like a forest. So, let's see what they can do next!
---
Whether or not you'll like the story depends on you, so obviously I can't speak for you. 
---
The story was fine, but I didn't play the game for the story, I played it for the endgame, so take that with a huge grain of salt.
---
So to be clear, all I have to do is purchase a single donation item to get the achievement?
---
Do you notice how educated your audience seem? Your equally minded xD xD me on the other hand, who is now your sworn internet enemy from r9k for the night understands what you said lmaoooooo
---
Random nonsense backed up by wiki quotes, which I know you read since you replied to where I posted it. Or at least, you could have clicked on the link and read it yourself.
---
Guild Wars 1 was factually named for an historical event called the Guild Wars. That's just how it is. Deal with it.
---
Invalid comment. See if you post answers without explaining how you got to them, it don’t matter how much smarter you are than me, what happens is that your reply is invalid and fails the tests because they didn’t ***show their solution*** to the teacher.
---
You’re right! You win and I.... win more: a game that says “zombie game” in its title is expected to have zombies in it. Not to be made about that guy, a non zombie, who wrote a song called zombie.
---
and 100 elonian wines for new weapon skin
---
Because everything is literal and context is nothing. That's not really how the world works. All  you've won is a bit of entertainment which ends now, because I won't be responding again. Shrugs. I have no problem with you believing you've won an internet argument.
---
Nah its not on caps
---
Tangentially related, but "orr" means "nose" in Hungarian. It was quite surprising and funny to see it first time on the world map.
---
The living story seasons are an important part of the overall plot of the game, so if story is something you value you should get an play them, they're not side plots for the most part, it all ties in and there are some VERY major developments that happen in living story. If you value the story as an important part of the game (which not everyone does, and that's fine), you should absolutely invest in them
---
That being said, LS2 only brings story (and some achievements and a few collections and an ascended backpack to go for). There are no new maps, and the rewards are limited. If you have a friend who can play through season 2 with you, you can play most of the story content without paying for it, so it may not be worth it to spend gems on if that isn't your priority.
---
S3 and S4 come with their own maps, some of which have incredible metas (especially S4's Dragonfall), all of which have easy access to ascended trinkets (most notably S3's Bitterfrost Frontier), so if you want to play S3 and S4's story, you'll need to purchase the seasons, and even if you're not interested, they have their own benefits.
---
It looks like everything but an elementalist
---
Oh, they may do it out of spite. For many months, it was the very same thing with Kodash (and it was crystal-clear that the server was dead/dying), until people got fed up after another link-less re-link and moved to Dzagonur. Guess ANet simply transferred Kodash's special treatment for forcing the server open once, too.
---
Oh hardcore raid scene is dead for sure. Or has moved to FFXIV a few months ago. Most of it at least.
---
After the end of the prologue story, I can’t wait to see what’s next. It’s a given that Bangar’s crew will become icebrood but I can’t wait to see how.
---
I usually don’t care much about the story due to not owning full living world episodes but the prologue was pretty exciting!
---
L2p issue.
---
Lol dude they are all about making shit moves for money. I thought it was clear by this point.
---
Even if they add more build diversity you are still locked behind 6 gear templates. Because you know, the clowns in anet just pulled a number from their asso. If any, the new build templates fiesta will only reduce the build diversity. Until delta decides to revive arc templates which is was a massively better system than anet's "official" solution
---
I just returned and got Grothmar and felt the same way. It was a GREAT zone. Had lots of horizontal landscape similar to old world zones and had some vertical components too. Very beautifully designed
---
Skybox is usually oval, spherical or semi spherical not literally a box.
---
That's literally my point. Not everyone is this dedicated to reddit. But you can't even fathom it
---
But did you watch the video
---
Its 40g for stat selectable all armor pieces that you dont need to make again ever since they are account bound
---
Imagine a Squad of 50 PvE players in WvW. No need to explain they would get crushed and the whole server would complain how they drag everyone down.
---
Now imagine the same in PvE. A squad of 50 WvWers doing map completion. Nobody would care.
---
And I think thats the core of the "problem" OP is adressing.
---
It's new elite spec with dark elements
---
you wouldn't find more than 30-40 pugs on an average day raiding in gw2, if thats not a definition of a dead game mode then i dont know what is lol.
---
Thats only during the good days sir.
---
I played it but tbh I don't remember after that many years.
---
But it's content, aren't you entertained?
---
i guess he didnt :))
---
So, it's been a long time since I've played. I thought gw2 wasn't supposed to have a tank/dps/heals system? Did that change since launch?
---
My guess would be the VPN. Basically you used the VPN to disguise yourself as someone else. One or more other people probably violated the rules while using the same VPN and got banned. Since you were all using the same disguise you could have been banned in an attempt to ban their alternate accounts. Additionally they might tie new accounts that any of you make to the banned ones and keep banning them. It's the only way to keep repeat offenders out.
---
If you need to use VPNs for work I suggest using split VPNs that only tunnel the traffic destined for computers at work into the VPN and keep letting the normal internet traffic (including guildwars) take the direct way.
---
No raid/CM purchases surely knocks the shine off of it and takes away a lot of the prestige.  Prestige is earned not bought.
---
Good Apple
---
&gt;On that we can agree on.
---
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 . This was my point indeed.
---
Try again
---
:D
---
Wait it doesnt ?
---
is it "Visiting" or "Fisting"...? Not sure...
---
Burden of Koda gang
---
But it's usually West or north, south is always amazing
---
In my experience its South or West. There may be some cultural effects in P A N I C
---
Same here.
---
That might be true, I'm a native south so maybe that's my ancestors hatred for North
---
expansions kind of ruined it. Right now, each class has sth they can do specifically good. Guardians Elite "Firebrand" is the ideal Healer in most situations. Big Heal Output and gives Boons like Quickness, Aegis, Stability.
---
So especially in Raids you get stuck in Class roles and theres not much variation. (Kind of why i despite Raids)
---
Tanks are still not required, but its Healer, Renegade/Chrono for Alacrity, Warrior for Banners and DPS in most groups.
---
Not relevant to Guild Wars 2
---
All the posts must be somehow connected to Guild Wars 2. You can use other games/books/etc. as an example, but you must somehow connect it to Guild Wars 2 and why it is relevant. I.E: "Here is a video of a WoW raids, I think ArenaNet should

---
&gt;I find it sad Anet didn't do more with ___
---
That's basically GW2's mantra.
---
This feels like something out of the early 2000s
---
Not as much as you apparently. Thanks for correcting me though
---
Time zone? Hello i am from EU we have night and day. And we also have a by far more active WvW then NA do so i would hope that it would be a fix for EU rather then NA.
---
And on top of that guilds, i assume that you play WvW for a while and know how many guild that are no more and those that are have shrunk in numbers to a point were they are around 10-15 maybe 20 at the best when raiding. 
---
And again you decide who is in the alliance but not on your world. So you will have a shit ton of players on your world that play what they want and do what they want just like today. You have no say about those players at all.
---
Not Anet hate tank meta, the sPvP players hate tank meta. It was BY FAR the worst meta to exist!
---
I can't see shit. Help
---
Contact support for old account when creating new account use a different email
---
I miss Amala, such a great character, and we never saw her again :(.
---
of course - people with a consumerist mindset will do anything for gold
---
Nice artstyle, post more art :D.
---
You clearly fail at fashion wars.
---
But.. on the entire map there are like 10 enemies alive at the same time without events.
---
Made ticket yesterday and ofc I use different email for new account. Thanks for reply, tho
---
Best 8h content I ever played
---
The new hubs don't have bank, trading post, and crafting stations. That's what made the interim version so great.
---
If you have a guild you'll visit the guild hall for the daily gathering anyway.
---
If I remember correctly, there is a keybind you can set that lets you have auto targeting while that key is being held down.
---
Aw c'mon, I am west and I just hate East (which is the lane I most often see fail or be late because of AFKs)
---
War never changes
---
I donated at all the tiers and got nothing... :/
---
Old LA was so much better..
---
well the original idea on gw2 was, that you can play each class as you want but still be able to do the content.
---
So you wont ever see for example a Warrior who uses his shouts as heal backup. Elites destroyed the "balance" and Raids and the way they are played reinforced that.
---
except for their "Role", theres no use for some classes, or at least they dont get played when you follow current Meta.
---
Guardian is a very bad example btw, since its the most versitile class right now. try it with Warrior or Engineer.
---
&gt; an experienced veteran running a meta-build can do 2-3x as much damage (be worth 2-3 homebrew builds)
---
I remember a dev recently saying that there's up to 10 times the difference in DPS between players on the two ends of the skill spectrum.
---
Erza?
---
is it time for ... P A N I C ?!
---
Play your toons up to 80. Follow along the personal story track. Complete the expansion story tracks. Go for works completion. Run dungeons/fractals. Play WvW. Build a legendary. Barbie out your favorite toon.
---
Lots of options.
---
Fair enough, but I remain weary. We've never gotten a proper non-humanoid combat tonic.
---
honk honk :)
---
That we have not, but they wouldn't list something like this as a combat tonic if it was just for brawling.
---
I mean the top raid guilds can clear most raids with like &lt;5 people, so I’m sure you can run shout heals if you really want. Just a matter of if you are good enough
---
Is your character a coffee creamer? Cause it looks vanilla as fuccckkkk
---
Best comment I'd say. Perfect 5/7.
---
&gt; Balloons were supposed to fall
---
&gt; running out of Helium
---
Hmm. Maybe we can try putting air in them? Then they will fall too and we can replenish our balloon supply for person 1 000 001!
---
He mentioned Firebrand so I went with it. Every profession except for warrior can do heal and damage (except for rev everyone has good power *and* condi builds). Warrior has it's own op role next to a condi and power only build.
---
It sounds like you honestly want a gear grind to give you a sense of progression after hitting max level, and to make up for your lack of improvement in playing a class. 
---
GW2 doesn't have this one, fixed goal of getting stronger gear, it will never have that. It also doesn't often dangle a definite carrot in front of your nose, even though there is a ton to do. 
---
This has a strange effect on some people: They either start seeing a thousand things that are worth doing, or they start believing that nothing is. The sad part is that there is no solution: Either a reward appeals to you or it doesn't. If you don't like skins, you could still to after Ascended or Legendary sets, however. They offer a small boost in stats and Legendary items allow for stat swapping. 
---
Liking GW2's combat is a matter of taste, but it's definitely a well-crafted combat system that a lot of people enjoy. 
---
You don't enjoy casual gameplay but shy the hardcore? Entire game modes like fractals, which even have a faceroll tier or two? 
---
No wonder you're feeling like you're in purgatory. You need to get in touch with guides and with people that can train you. 
---
This is under the assumption that you haven't really paid attention to your classes while levelling them. (It would explain your urge to re-level classes that you didn't even like.) Central Tyria is casual af, you can basically faceroll everything. If you want a challenge, you need to intentionally seek out zones that challenge your character, don't stay within the appropriate range. 
---
Don't feel bad about it. I get your situation. Getting into something with no proper guidance can be exhausting. 
---
But in order to find something to like in this game, you need to play it with an open mind. Try everything. Join a training guild for a game mode you want to get into. Level your classes with dedication, read what your skills do. Check out WoodenPotatoes' open world builds for classes you've already maxed. 
---
Skip season 2 and play some Heart of Thorns. 
---
It's easy to not like something one has given not too much thought. Pick a class, maybe even ranger. Go on a real journey. Read some guides, like those on metabattle or Snow Crows. Don't just copy them, try to make sense of each utility and synergy. If unsure, you can ask questions, even here on reddit. 
---
And look out for people that can teach you. The game won't do it, but they are there, and they are waiting for people like you. 
---
However, keep in mind: 
---
- no gear grind
---
- no tutorialization 
---
- no definite carrot 
---
- the combat system will never be overhauled 
---
If these things really end up killing your enjoyment, you must leave the game behind. No point in clinging to something that doesn't fulfil you.
---
They would need to reward the track with a part of gift of exploration like 1/4 (to forge it later in the mystic forge into gift of exploration) to relativize the time investment like in pve to make it even. Maybe even twice of 1/4 parts of gift of exploration since you get 2 gifts in pve. Gift of battle in comparison requires much less time but rewards you only with 1 gift if I remember correctly.

If i craft precursor and make it legendary, will I be able to sell it or it will be account bound like pre once crafted ?

In pvp (firebrand) tome 3 recently got nerfed. I know that skills 2 no longer provides aegis. Was part of the nerf getting rid of aegis in skill 5 as well? Or has aegis never been a part of skill 5 and I’m just dumb? I’m confused because on the wiki it says tome 3 skill 5 grants aegis but the last time I pvpd (also about maybe 2/3 weeks ago) Yhe skill wasn’t granting it. Is that some sort of bug or?
---
The legendary is not bound until you equip it.
---
tyty good sir
---
It's fairly clear that the original GW1 campaign was designed for PvP to be the end game.
---
Pre-Searing ended with a PvP fight. Every city had a PvP arena.
---
The whole Crystal Desert section basically had you practising PvP mechanics, with Heroes Ascent originally being in the Tombs right at the end of that section of the game.
---
as long as the option is there to buy gems with ingame gold I am justified in saying that something costs 45 bucks just is false because it doesn't and I sure as hell wont pay that to get the gems I need
---
Condi bs is currently one of the strongest dps builds while buffing the entire team.

I've heard he's appearing on The Masked Singer. And when they reveal his face, it's a potato.

Skip LWS2, it's not worth the price and there'll already be a gap thanks to LWS1. So level up to 80, start HoT. By the time you're done you should be able to afford LWS3, it'll be a smooth ride all the way to the current content. If you want to go for Ascended gear, start crafting time-gated materials right after buying LWS4.
---
Exotic gear costs less than 20 gold total, so it won't be a big deal. If you want to make sure to have enough spare cash without needing to touch the material storage, just take the time and gather stuff as you explore maps. Iron ore and elder wood logs are especially plentiful and worthwhile. 
---
Once you start PoF, try to spend some time in the maps to earn trade contracts for the mounts, as it is possible to hit the experience marks without earning enough trade contracts. Masteries for each mount unlock once you acquire the mount in question (train Canyon Jumping, then High Vault, and finally Shifting Sands to get the most out of them. After that you can just coast the rest.) Hero points will be easy to come by, and there's more than enough points around to unlock everything.
---
Remember that there's no hurry. Do whatever you enjoy. It's an MMORPG, every little thing moves you forward, so just have fun.
---
Fastest is probably rushing the hearts on all toons and gathering close nodes, took me 2 or 3 days and maybe 7h~ of hearts to go from 0 to 250 on every currency, it's boring but it goes fast if you have a bunch of toons, all hearts are really easy and quick other than 2 Kourna ones iirc.
---
Couple more questions now that I'm a bit more interested in 'certain' aspects of GW2.
---
1 - So, Ranger, I'm quite fond of how rangers function, but I'm not overly fond of the choices of animals. How soon would I be able to get rid of my base starter pet? Any specific level or training/skill/whatever?
---
2 - I'm assuming you cannot change your character customization anymore right? e.g. hair style change
---
3 - What's the fastest way to gain transmutation charges and dyes? Yeah I'm only 3 days in and I'm already planning for fashion wars (at least for as cheap as I can get them so far)
---
Season 2 does have a couple of notable collections in Mawdrey and Bioluminescent Armour, but the value isn't the same overall as Seasons 3 and 4, I agree.
---
Again, the difference between sword and dagger is within 300-400 dps. It will never make a noticeable difference. Pick with ever one you think is better, cooler, sexier etc.
---
Is LWS 2 rly that bad? I enjoyed it very much, and I caught up on the story thanks to the LWS 1 movie from DreammyAbaddon. There are plenty of ways to bridge the story.
---
our daily shilling thread about Gr\*thmar V\*lley
---
Feels like you are jumping ship too early, I would recommend at least putting in the effort to experience raids and fractals. If you don't want to put in the time learn classes for fractals, then what are the chances you put in the effort to learn LA weaving in eso? Imo the combat is a little more complicated in eso with all the animation cancelling; much harder to master. But I will say it sounds like you are more interested in the world and story, eso won't disappoint you there with many dlc stories and its original 3 faction story lines. But graphic wise gw2 is much better imo. I can say so much more about both games, but I'll leave it here.
---
I'm actualy thankful for the low draw distances lol. I just want them to fix the high saturation that they're very fond of, even with post processing off it can be a bit excessive.
---
Definitely based on the [spooky dog](https://i.imgur.com/HkG8zSC.mp4) and not the spooky mount.

*[Previously on No Wars Today.](http://www.nojamtoday.com/eng/mmorpg/)*
---
Maybe "Archeage" and "Rift" are the only right names
---
That_shaman found out in the files that the blue title appears on top because it uses a (hidden) color code symbols at the beginning of the title name and alphabetically symbols always come first.
---
So should they proceed forward with a colored system, it would become an alphabetical mess even amongs colored ones.
---
I didn't think it was. But that's just personal taste. Again, I'm not a fan of snow biomes in general.
---
Wizard hat and still keeps her hair!?
---
How can this be?!
---
I agree the Orr maps need some ramping, 
---
They definitely need a some way for players to know the current progress of the map and how long may it take for the next meta to start. 
---
Either a progress bar that fills as events are completed like Istan, the Queen's Pavillion and Silvewastes, or fixed times like Dry Top, HoT/PoF/ and most other timed metas.
---
But merging is not a good solution for these maps. I'm pretty sure merging maps isn't as easy as you may think.
---
Looking at how many events and NPCs each map has, it's clear that each map can only have so much stuff going on inside. Events, scripts, NPCs, etc...    
---
And of course each map can only have so many players per instance. From about 50 players on smaller maps and maps where players will stay very close for a long time, up to about 150 on the largest maps where players will be spread most of the time. 
---
PoF maps are larger, but there's also much less event density. 
---
It'll only be possible to merge or expand those maps with half or less than average events and NPCs inside, like Bloodstone Fen and Southsun. 
---
For example, take Like Dry Top and Silverwastes. There's a huge empty area north of Dry Top just as large as Silverwastes that one can visit by leaving the map with a skyscale of the northern wall of the canyon. It's pretty clear they considered expanding Dry Top to make it large, so the Silverwastes would have been part of it.   
---
But merging those two maps would be rather counter-productive, since  Dry Top has a map-wide timed meta and Silverwastes a map-wide progressive meta, they each have their own currencies, and both maps have lots of NPCs and events. So it was better to make Silverwastes its own thing.  
---
It would be cool if they went back to the small and empty maps to expand them, but I don't think it would be a good idea to merge maps, unless they were able to upgrade the server and game engine to actually make the world seamless by splitting each map into 'chunks' and stitch them all together, so players only have to load adjacent chunks.
---

In the 2nd raid tournament, there were mentions of cheating by pre recording raid wing clears, so the clear wasnt live and thus to ensure that this wont happen again on the last raid tournament they made sure that 1 person from the raid is from teapots team that just ggs and watches the clear. When real money is involved in community organized tournaments, you want to make sure everyone is following the rules.
---
Bg pa ba kayo?

The map has a tonne of similarities to Pre-Searing Ascalon from GW1, I feel like it had to be intentional. The citadel is like Ascalon City, the beautiful wooden hills and flowers, idilic forests nestled against the cold of the Shiverpeaks with hint to a threat from beyond. Even the area the jumping puzzle is in is a lot like the area Nicholas Sandford is in.
---
I think it might be intentionally mirroring Ascalon and if the map wasn't so heavily built around the celebratory atmosphere with the metas, I'd be expecting a future episode to bring some kind of invasion from the Shiverpeaks down upon the place.
---
Personally I love how bright and saturated the colors are, especially in comparison to the rest of Ascalon!
---
A mix on future maps would be nice. Areas of low mob denisity and areas more heavily populated. It may even be fine to see areas become more or less populated based on meta events or day/night cycles.
---
Interesting. Pre-searing has such an iconic feel to it, which I don't quite get in the Grothmar. But when you put it like that, they are somewhat similar, aren't they? I mean, yeah, they might be the only pristine Ascalon maps from each game.
---
My guess is that it’ll work like the [Wolf Totem](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wolf_Totem_(gizmo)), which is a novelty transformation that you can craft when you do the first Howler collection. The collection requires you to become a wolf with wolf skills and kill ambient creatures. So I’m guessing you turn into a fiesty cat with cat skills but instead of costume brawl it can do “real” damage. Doubtful it will be a cat that can still use full skills and utility.
---

Don’t send gold to team members or opponents in ranked spvp.
---
What you are doing is one small step from pay to Win trade.(anet see what you do and don’t care if you ask them to quit or ask them to play their best.. you pay its win trade if you win)
---
If anyone else in the match knows they will /report and you could easily catch dishonor (which slows down your que time to zero) or even a temp ban just because of how bad it looks for you to send money to opponents when playing pvp.
---
(I would especially never do this in the AT/mAT.. you are risking a perma over nothing)
---
For some players it takes longer to 'click' with how the game works.
---
There's players who never got the game until years after leaving. 
---
Don't forget you yourself change over time. Just because it isn't working for you right now it doesn't mean you may not get it later.
---
Something similar happened to me with the Diablo franchise. I liked each game when they were released, but I would not like them as much now. If they ever made a Diablo IV I would prefer if it wasn't an much of an isometric gear-grinder mowing down enemies before their skills matter and had more focus on less but more difficult enemies.
---
"your burns are so weak, a -50% condi duration buff does nothing"
---
Its replay value is pretty low for sure, but for me getting those easy points for auto-loot was high value.  And that was after trying to grind out points from the hardcore world bosses. 
---
I definitely haven’t gone back after that, though.
---
Nice analogy there with the trek.
---
Have you looked at metabattle and snowcrows? I've found it's useful to look at classes you aren't playing to at least understand how they work and what they're going to be doing in a fight.
---
Well my problem is that I never really experienced content in GW2 when it was released. I finished the personal story a few months ago, after not finishing it for about 5-6 years.
---
I played some LS1 when it came out, maybe one mission. That's it.
---
I'm just afraid that I will always be late. I don't want to always have to play content that is months or even years old, knowing that others experience all that new stuff.
---
On the other hand, I don't want to skip chapters because it feels wrong to just jump in time and play it in a different order :(
---
I often think it has something to with how I perceive the game, but this makes me thinking that it must be my fault that I kinda don't enjoy it.
---
Ok that is a very good point for why you feel so disconnected from the game, to that I would advise you "IF" you wish to continue to try and connect to the game alot of what was said still applies with regard to learning you classes and possibly find a guild or guilds that train you in the different parts of the game you want to try but also see if you can a few new players that are experiencing parts of story (in your case the Living Story) and move thru those chapters together mind you only need to find a few people to make helpful. If I found myself in you situation that is direction I would taking. Just my opinion and best of luck.

That sword is pretty representative of the [Iron Greatsword](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/1/1a/Iron_Greatsword.jpg) with some motion blurs and a bit of artistic license adding the cloth coming off the grip.  It's incredible how good looking the basic skins can be on their own, and how fancy they can become with only very minor additions.
---
Yep, it's exactly just a simple crafted sword with a red cloth to sell more motion and go along with whole floating buttcape situation
---
Well the last tournament happened 2 months ago, no cheating happened, and the right people won the prize, so whether you agreed to how they organized it or not, it wouldn't have mattered. Idc either way.
---
indeed. the halloween shield is a good example. remember when anet hinted they were about to add a way to get the coveted halloween skins as a drop from mystic forge? the shield went from 5500g to 200g \~ in zero seconds flat.  the skin hoarders panicked. showed just how many of them actually existed.
---
You're right. I watched the clip too, but thought he said "build template" instead of "new build". Or maybe I just remembered wrong.
---
Standard, Deluxe, or Ultimate i see the listed differences but don’t really u Derek all that they have?
---
In a vacuum, just go all berserker. There's a bit of space to optimize in organized group content, but you really don't need to worry about that.
---
I may be a good person to ask. I just downloaded and played it for the first time last week.      
---
I have played most big MMO's. World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls Online, Final Fantasy, EverQuest, Star Trek Online are the ones I probably played the most.     
---
I don't know why I thought this but I thought Gw2 was a Tower capture MMO, so I dismissed it as I am not good at those games.      
---
I downloaded the free game and within a few days bought the complete game. So did my fiancee. It really is a cross between a lot of MMO's. It isn't as cartoony as WoW, it has the feel of ESO but not as sad and dark, it reminded me of Final Fantasy but with more of an American flair.         
---
It's perfect for people who aren't into the story as much. It was level 10 before my too  was introduced to the storyline. I like how I level out in WoW before I can even complete the story line. Not so with Gw2, it's a bit random running around looking for different icons to play the equivalent of world quests and dailies. Maybe the story will pick up after I play a bit longer.      
---
The actual game play to me was super easy. My toon was auto killing the mob once I got her started. I don't like how you can't move the spells around or anything for the matter on the UI. You can change the keybind but I can't drag and drop my spells in the order that I want to. There are virtually no add-ons, the few I saw didn't offer anything I needed. Gw2 discourages their use.       
---
Over all I have found it enjoyable, the community in game seem to be friendly. Well worth the $30 to me for probably a couple years of gameplay.     
---
There is no obligation to play if you download and try it. I even downloaded League of Legends to see what all the hype was about. I deleted that after 10 minutes of gameplay. So it's that simple if you don't like Gw2.
---

she should have 100% been the leader of the free awakened after Joko's death. We would have had history with her and it would have been a far more uplifting end for her character arc to become liberated from Joko in the end, rather than to die as his slave.
---
It sounds like you are sticking one way of playing, open world pve and personal story. Branch out play fractals, raids, pvp, wvw give any mode you try give it a good go tho. People will often enough try something new have a bad experience for w/e reason and give up on it right away, dont be one of those people. Gw2 is a mmo that has more to it than some players want to realize, just because you like PvE the most doesnt mean you cant get something out of the pvp modes, or any of the other activities in the game.
---
As for getting into other game modes Anet does a terrible job of helping you out with in game tutorials. Gw2 has a built in /wiki feature so I think its fair to say anet expects players to use the wiki and other resources outside of the game to get information on the finer details of the game.
---
Guild wars 1/2 are 2 games I have played alot over the years and the nature of them not having a sub fee or gear progression leads very well into a drop in drop out play style. You wanna to scratch that itch? Log in go nuts. You want to spend your time on other video games or irl stuff? have at it guild wars will be there when you want to come back. No game has to be the sole game you play that dominates your attention and last forever, its okay to move on to other things either temporarily or permanently.

Thanks for the update i was so worried i couldnt ssleep

By premium he means the 2000-2500 gems skin. All we got is a 5-warclaws-pack and 2 licenses.
---
Ty for the heads up Touch! 
---
My question is though, I am not paying anyone INSIDE the actual match. I am paying people to queue up, which means they have a chance of being in the same match as me. I guess how anet could see what I am doing and ban me, but I am merely incentivizing people to queue up. This could not affect matchmaking since that is done by algorithms.
---
You make a fair point though!

I don't think Anet does black Friday deals.
---
It’s really fun, actually. You have to go find a variety of ambient creatures and kill them as a wolf. They’ll never see it cominggggggggggg!
---
Gift of Battle is the one chance I'm forced as a PvEr to dip into WvW.
---
Now, "forced" may come off as a strong word. But I'm actually thankful because I do enjoy the brief times I spend in WvW, even though I'm forced to do it. 
---
It's weird how game experiences work that way. But the point is I think Gift of Battle is healthy for the game mode.
---
GW2 (ESPECIALLY in the LWs) really do an amazing job blending UI with storytelling, don't they?

You are correct in that it cost you 0 cash to purchase, but you are wrong in saying that it cost you nothing. Sure, you got that gold from playing the game, but you didn't get to use that gold on other things in game because you converted it to gems.
---
That gold has an opportunity cost, you have to spend time to make gold, just like you spend time to make money.
---
You could have earned far more cash in the time it took you to earn your gold to gems. So, you actually invested MORE into your gem purchases than if you had just bought them with cash.
---
At minimum wage (at least in the US), you can earn the cash equivalent of 800 gems an hour, easily. Can you earn the equivalent 200 gold in an hour? If you can, please share with me your secret farm, because I'd love to get in on that.

As the commenter below said, there's sadly not much voice acting, but texts imo are very much worth reading.
---
100,000 builds and the game still can't save bank position in the ui
---
That’s great! We go back to play regularly when we’re revisiting familiar locations in GW2 and I’m always surprised to see I still have all my Monk muscle memory from all those years of GvG. 15th anniversary is coming up soon! I’m officially old!
---
It's pronounced "clawrr".
---
"a sudden"
---
They won't fix it for the same reason they won't go smooth out the cinematic sequences from the old dungeons: it garners them no gain.
---
So many builds yet so little content.
---
Wow, this is one of the coolest GW2 arts
---
This is great work! Caudecus would gladly (and creepily) hang this in his bedroom.
---
This is way late.. but, I used my stored XP Boosters, Birthday Boosters, food, and banners. Without them it would take significantly more
---
It took me around 10 hours to go from 7-80
---
Probably the fastest way to level other than tomes or crafting.
---
theres a third party addon to fix this? is it legal? don‘t wanna get banned but you got me interested! 
---
i have a rtx 2080 ti and an i9 processor yet the game has framedrops quite often. could you tell me about this third party addon?
---
So it was roughly 80k builds in when they shipped a living story patch that would crash your game when trying to go to kourna?
---
But then you lose MF
---
you could cast 1 or 2 skills that give the target a vulnerability, or bleeding or chill or something like that or one that is a combo starter, then follow that up with a direct damage skill that takes advantage of whatever condition you placed on that target so that your direct damage skill is further modified and does amplified damage. your build trait might state that if target is chilled, next skill critically hits. or if you used a combo starter, swapping weapons might have a combo finisher for a lot more damage.
---
Best case scenario is you using your skills to adapt to the situation. If you use the same skills all the time, you either found a cookie cutter build or you're doing it wrong.
---
Naturally there are synergies, but no amount of synergy in the world will work 100% of the time, so sooner or later you will be better off by changing things around a bit.
---
Keep also in mind that almost everything is viable in GW2. Especially in open world, but also in the lower difficulties of group and/or organized content. The gap between the lower end of everything viable and the higher end between everything viable, never mind meta, is fucking colossal however. So if you struggle with X but still make it, changing to Y might blow your mind.
---
I was sort of with you there until you used the word retarded.
---
"Oh, Minister Beetlestone, you did not disappoint"
---
But that's a genuely good idea  
---
The game has to earn money, and I'm much more willing to pay for a convenience item and a slot to have it shared between my characters, than for two outfits, which is the same gem pricepoint XD
---
Thanks a lot, I guess I understood it right then. I tried to play around a bit with rotations but wasn't too sure how connected everything is.
---
Seems pretty comprehensible :) would you say that I can play end game content even with a self-made build or do I have to use meta builds?
---
And is condition DPS viable in most cases? I tend to enjoy it a little bit more than power dps.
---
I can.

a build usually happens when a dev checks something into a branch that has automatic builds enabled. maybe (though imho unlikely) they don't do that for dev branches and it only happens when they merge stuff into a testing branch or whatever. estimating 225 work days per year (with \~5 weeks of vacation/sick time) that means about 40 builds per day. quite frankly, I don't find that impressive, on the contrary. I easily trigger 5-10 builds per day when I do bugfixing, when working on projects it may only be 2-3 though. and since I'm in a small business, I also have a lot of meetings to do requirements engineering, project planning and even support, so I'm not even a full time programmer. if I consider the lower end of 2 check-ins that result in a build per dev and day, it would mean 20 people actually do any work. for an mmo, that seems like an awfully low number of devs, but kinda makes sense, as some features apparently take years to be developed.

&amp;#x200B;

I do like when they share internal stuff and I don't want to discourage that, but unless their build and automated testing procedures are very different than the ones I'm used to at my workplaces (which may have a bit higher standards in terms of q&amp;a and automated testing; I couldn't say as I've never worked in the entertainment industry), this number is really disheartening.

Candy corn, nougat, plastic teeth and skulls can be combined into refined currency at the rate of 1000 to 1 at the vendors in Lion's Arch. Candy Corn Cobs are the most useful, but all of them can be deposited into your bank's material storage by clicking on the gear at the top of your inventory.

Foods... sell em at TP or use the composter for chef ingredients if you do that (this is a very cheap way to get compost, I recommend doing this if you can).
---
Tonics are just funsies. I let 'em stack til the event is over and then sell/delete.
---
The utility items like pumpkin oil... eh, use em. There's zero reason not to have hours' worth of buffs that are purely beneficial.
---
The rest, like toilet paper and eggs, you can open once to get the collection credit, then delete at will.
---
Sure, in this case I don't mind it, but it's clearly what they're going for.
---
Thank you for sharing! Will definitely follow your pages if you dont mind op \o/
---
Or any infusion while we're at it
---
How is a lv1 going to use something that requires lv80?
---
Ah I see. I did change my email in the paat but thats at least a year ago. Think it could still be the case?
---
d912pxy. I don't think it's officially approved but it doesn't break any rules and nobody got banned for it either.
---
afaik infusions get "destroyed" when inserted into gear so i can at least kinda see why that's a pain in the ass. i still think it should be an option too though
---
Toons/characters
---
Depends on the game, but it is often indeed a box. There is no way to unwrap a sphere into a sane square UV, so if it needs to display any complex animations, it has to be made of planes. It can be hidden fairly well by distance and a lack of shading.
---
Amazing! And kinda ominous, for some reason
---
Yeah sad to see that even such a nice little information gets pissed on.
---
&gt; Use at your own risk because Anet can't oversight them due to limited resources.
---
this is such an infuriating statement in this context... from anet mind you, not yourself. people are asking about the legality of the *advertised* functionality of these addons, and whether or not *that* functionality is likely to interfere with ToS compliance. and their response is "there is a security risk". yeah, no shit, but that doesn't answer the question.
---
people, including galrath here, are asking whether or not their account is at risk of getting *irretrievably sanctioned by ANet directly* for using it, not whether using some rando third party program is posing a general *security* risk.
---
I mean meme aside is he ok ? Did he post anything anywhere ?
---
And yet i can count with 2 hands how many were actual balance patches
---
thats reddit for you
---
wow the salty replies to this thread are pathetic ._.
---
The support can take a while depending on how much information you gave them. Just wait and don't submit another ticket. We can't do anything for you here.
---
Darn, that's a shame. I heard there's a free to play version now. Is there any way I can play that while I wait? Or am I still screwed because my email address is attached to that account?
---
And yet the balance is still shit.
---
Haters love to hate basically is what he is saying. Anet does quite a number of head-scratching things that make it hard for some people to praise the things they do get right or downplay it.
---
GW2 is great for many players. You will want to try it to see if you like it. It's much less guided than WoW is. You're out on your own exploring and doing whatever you want, right out of the intro mission.
---
I really love GW2 because it's super solo friendly. You can definitely party up with people if you want to, but since everyone gets loot as long as they contribute to the event or fighting a mob, you can pretty much ad-hock join into any fight you see anywhere in the world.
---
If you're into dungeons, raids, etc, there are plenty of guilds you can join for a regular group to play, though raids will require expansion purchase. There is an LFG tool where you can list for people to join a dungeon or whatever, but there is no system to automatically set you up with a PUG.
---
The game is generally considered easier than most MMOs, and it has a very wide range of skill levels of people you will encounter.
---
Other players have summarized the F2P restrictions better than I can.
---
Quite possibly. That was my issue! Support should be able to help, they were really helpful it just took a few days is all
---
It's been like this for a few years. It's doubtful anything will change. They should hire some of these people, but I digress.
---
I wasn't trying to bring drama I was just answering your question. I personally loved the meme and gave it an upvote.
---
Well, yeah. Welcome to the modern day development cycle lol.
---
Really wish he started using his hammer again. I get that his brothers sword is sentimental but that doesn't stop Brahm from putting his bow away to use his mace and shield every so often.
---
It took me a week to get my original account back from launch. Instead of waiting I just started a new account. The old account is barely used now.
---
Bloody Prince Thorn: How dare you. You struck my name from history!
---
Mad King Thorn: I would have given it back to you the moment you learned your lesson.
---
Bloody Prince Thorn: But I died in that box!
---
Mad King Thorn: What can I say? You were always a slow learner.

MightyTeaPots channel might give you some insight. I hear he's into end game content like raids, but I haven't watched his stuff.

Bow AA does more dps than scepter, has a longer range, and bounces to a 2nd target. Every 3 seconds the bow AA can tag 8 individual mobs and the scepter can tag 6. Bow skills 3, 4, and 5 help tag big groups when they spawn similar to scepter 2 except you can pre-fire skill 5 and then use 4 and 3 consecutively as opposed to just using scepter skill 2 once.
---
OP asked about open world PVE and asked if it's good. The answer is yes.
---
It's meta to say bow is bad on DH, but it's simply not true
---
dont buy the deluxe version go for ultimate it's much more worth it you get deluxe goodies for free that way on top of the standard version and if you would have bought 4000 gems later on
---
Changing a typo to count as a build and then creating more bugs to fix...... ♥ how fixing errors are added to that number. lolz
---
A decent portion of our GW2 guild still plays GW1 together weekly (most of us didn't originally play GW1 together, we were mostly in separate guilds). I'm still so happy that those servers were kept online as I love just vanquishing or mapping to relax now and then :)
---
1. You can tame any juvenile animals you find out in the wild. The wiki has an in depth [list of all locations here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_pet_locations).
---
2. As mentioned already you can buy [total makeover kits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Total_Makeover_Kit) or [self-style hair kits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Self-Style_Hair_Kit) for gems from the store but they can also be purchased with black lion statuettes from the chests. There are also [permanent contracts](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Permanent_Hair_Stylist_Contract) for sale on the trading post for 2k gold to change your hair as much as you want. Also the kits both have exclusive options that you can't get with a new character.
---
3. Honestly just do map completion, achievements, daily login, and you'll have a ton. If you really want more than you'll know what to do with PvP and WvW both drop a ton.
---
4. Was already mentioned but gold, materials, bank, other currencies, any account bound only gear can be moved (but that's mainly ascended as *most* exotics soul bind on equip). Things like guilds and friends are obviously the same on one account too as well as mastery unlocks. Story and map completion is split though so each character starts from scratch.
---
His wooden potatoes 2 channel was more active last I checked but that is just live stream uploads.
---
it's a large amount of builds but without any reference to how their pipeline works I can't really comment on how big an achievement it is.  Where I work as a web developer we have an automated build kick off every time code is merged into a monitored branch where it gets deployed to a test server for a QA team to evaluate.  this can happen anywhere from 5-10 times a day with our small team.  We also have nightly builds for a separate production branch that contains verified fixes, new features, and what not that are production ready for the next day or for a hotfix release that has to go out same day.  But before all of this automated stuff when working locally on stuff I may do 20-50 builds just developing and slowly testing each thing I do before committing my work to the codebase.
---
truth be told i don't think most developers really care about build numbers because we do so many local builds in a day that it all becomes an automated blur.  So in the end, it's an interesting little tidbit of information and for anet if they think it's worth celebrating then more power to them.
---
Turns out that it indeed was still linked to an old email. Luckily I still have access to it so im playing as we speak! Haha.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Also try gw2efficiency.com something like the daily page checklist or the boss timers might start h giving you a sense if purpose. 
---
Do you have all the mounts? Maybe take up beetle racing. 
---
Also nothing says gw2 had to be the only thing you play.  With wife life and kids I get to dip in once a week if that and still have plenty of fun without feeling behind
---
Is this an actual combat tonic, or just a tonic that gives abilities similar to the cat tonic you can buy with laurels?
---
Put them in your bank or make a character with 18 slot bags via tailoring (or buying) and store them there. I have two bank toons(nearly full) for this reason.
---
Contact support via in game
---
Why are people upset that other players are playing newer games
---
Yeah, it's just a fun info they posted.
---
That's super useful. I'll try that! Do I absolutely need a new account though?
---
Sometimes if feels like half of the subreddit only comes to complain and doesn't even try to understand how things work.
---
I think that text is a bit backwards.  Don't you mean "who knew that upsetting your endgame content playerbases would make them leave"?
---
Even so, as a 'casual' probably by your standards I'm not surprised by the current state of the playerbase/game.  A bit sad, about it though.
---
&gt;**Please do not**
---
&gt; - Post image macros or no context images
---
&gt; - Post low-effort/-value posts
---
What the hell is with all these posts lately, and why do none of them ever get removed?
---
Pro strats: keep a bank tab open. Transfer all the garbage into it. Make a new character. Transfer all garbage to new character. Delete new character. Fastest way.
---
&gt; Supporter is the easiest for someone who doesn't want to PvP.
---
That does not mean that it is the fastest for people who just want to pay money and be done with it instead.
---
more like https://youtu.be/Ep_blZhvI2A
---
This topic again? The only arguments you will find are "who cares if you leave, it's all intentional, you are not the target playerbase".
---
Anet: we worked on this game for a long time, but right now we are downsizing and abandoning more engaging kinds of content and veteran community.
---
Reddit and twitter: we have left a lot of thankful comments (and our money) in the past, but right now, fuck you.
---
Fair and square.
---
Yeah I remember when I realized you could instantly reverse direction with the blinks, that was really cool. Pent like an hour jumping off cliffs just to blink back onto the ledge without turning around lol.
---
And I know it's gimmicky, but the sand portal temple puzzle in Crystal Oasis is still one of the coolest experiences in PoF. I still run it from start to finish sometimes just because nailing all of the jumps in one fluid run makes me feel so badass.
---
Distance makes the heart grow fonder. Maybe he's trying to build his viewership? Hope he's okay, whatever the reason is.
---
Build =/= patch
---
For every bug fix you build probably a dussin times.
---
It's debatable if the newer playerbase spends more on average than the older, more end game focused ones. Neither of us have numbers for that. I've probably spent more money on this game than the casuals that only login every couple of months. Given that my account value is higher than 90% of the playerbase on gw2efficiency, but who knows how accurate that really is.
---
I honestly don't care about AP at all and I try to do it every day. I like the small sample that I can't blow 1k in 10 minutes worth like ectopic gambling.
---
Contact support, explain the mistake, everything is fine.
---
and isn't it rude to be a lazy fuck and not bother searching an easy to find answer? 
---
oh i forgot this is gw2 subreddit where being a new player makes you new to the internet as well
---
just like in game! when new players don't use chat because they aren't high enough level to unlock basic social skills right?
---
Forbidden OTP.

But there IS a [confirmation windows](https://imgur.com/KxYtbE0).

Wow, it's that one post on every online game subreddit I've ever been to. Hello again old friend.
---
Yes, the first LAUNCH trailer, not alpha test trailer. An alpha test is how they test the game. The launch trailer advertises the game and gives it direction. It tells you about the game.
---
The LAUNCH trailer, shows something that is clearly not a PvP scene or game, and mentions the Guild Wars as a historical event. People who were buying the game at launch would have known the guild wars were a historical event. This wasn't something that was made up and added later.
---
It was there from the very beginning.
---
Nope, they just said the "We worked on this game for a long time" part. Adding anything else to it is like being that family member who insists on talking politics at every gathering, no matter how many times people try to discuss something else for a minute.
---
Let’s be real though, how many of these were only gemstore updates??
---
I doubt those skills are up to par too tbh :)
