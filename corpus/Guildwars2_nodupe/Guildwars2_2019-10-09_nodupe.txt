What kind of value would one find in a GW2 account? 
---

---
If they wanted mass skins to play fashion wars without actually playing the game, they can already just buy the majority of them through gem&gt;gold conversion and the rest of them directly through the gemstore providing artificial scarcity isn't in effect for the skins they want. 
---
If they want ingame achievements that are hard to get/require effort, you can pay raid sellers for just about any of that (most of them will do anything, not just raids/fractals). I've also seen cases of people in my guild sharing accounts and paying gold/cash in order to do world completion and the skyscale collection.
---
I fail to see there being a big enough demand for this in GW2 for it to be worth Anet's time, not much that is of value that can't already be bought through gem conversion.
---
And frankly it just doesn't seem like something Anet would ever do, their happy rainbow image is all about having an identity in Tyria that is your own.
---
I'm indifferent to this idea but I do not see it happening in this game, ever.
---
---
---
Deal! When?
---
I see a dark stripe...
---
Not gonna lie, I've had dreams where I run around like this.
---
That's not what happened though. As a woman who believes in equality for all what happened was not an example of that. She overreacted and saw sexism where there was none, she was being really offensive and got fired for being offensive not because she was 'pointing out sexism' if anything she was the one being sexist.   
---
The guy didn't say anything wrong and nothing in what he said came across as sexist or mansplaining to me. I'm one of the first people to point out sexism in either direction if it warrants pointing out and I've had plenty of guys make actual sexist comments to me or tried to mansplain in the decades I've been in the gaming community but that's not what happened here. She deserved to get fired.
---
&gt; as well as a list of almost everyone with a security clearance (military, spies, gov officials, etc).
---
Your point stands but the information they breached was 5+ years ago and it didn't give them who has a security clearance, just those who had applied.
---
rofl
---
lighting  in this game can really alter the colors, but you never know.
---
it has really means a lot to say goodbye
---
Let’s not forget, GW2 uses the same engine as GW1, so in the least, traits/skills template code should be easy to convert and port.. since gw1 is still running, we know they have the code sitting around.
---
It's doing it's best.
---
Do you care about upgrade-ability? If not, then consider buying used and an intel a few generations back. The one good thing about intels slow performance increase over the years has been that you can get a fairly cheap  used rig that will play games like guild wars2  fairly well. If you do buy used , you need to be somewhat competent in pc repair just in case. Make sure to get something with a high cpu clock as gw2  really  likes single threaded performance,

---
Here's the thing - they don't care. NA is 55% _now_, but China is a _rapidly growing_ 12%, in the most populated nation on earth, with raising birth rates. 
---
They got pretty much peak market share in the US, which has a declining population. 
---
You're seeing a lot of NA and EU multinational make moves to not piss off that China market, also because they know our next downturn is likely to shatter the country with our political polarization.
---
recent collapse of integrity? have you just started playing their games?
---
If her politics are an indicator I'm sure she's cool with taking one for the team
---
That or bannerslave.
---
I prefer the term bannerlord, myself.
---
That's every fucking MMO. Did you really expect this one to be different? They all have a shelf life. May I make a suggestion. Instead of buying another game just spend your time learning computer programming or take some college classes in the STEM field. That is only thing worth "investing" in and won't be a waste of your time. No wonder your mom thinks raising you was a waste of time. Hell she even told me last night that the time spent having sex to conceive you would have been better spent doing something else, you're that much of a disappointment.
---
Investing time in playing an MMO, lol. How fucking stupid are you?
---
I have always held that the way Riot does microtransactions is the gold standard. Allow any game-affecting item to be purchaseable with varying amounts ingame currency, or upfront with premium currency, with the price varying based on how long it has been since release. For cosmetics, premium currency only, with the price dropping after a length of time, except for timed exclusives.
---
The core issue I have with the BLCs is that in games, randomness is the bane of fun, unless the game offers some way to control it. If they did away with the chests entirely, or removed keys from the gemstore and just upped the drop rate (maybe make them a guaranteed drop from map completion on certain maps?), put all the cosmetics in the gemstore, and left things like Endless Contracts, BL Skins, and other consumables, I feel like that would please everyone. The rare stuff would still be rare but be farmable in a sense, and the outfits and things that only some people want, they can get with gems.
---
So OP should be a savant when it comes to differentiating.

GUYS HOLD UP BE CAREFUL. u/Litajones8 is an account that is only a few days old and is posting links to places you can buy the shirt. OP's account is a year old, but only has 14 post Karma and -18 account karma. You will probably recieve the shirt but more than likely it will be of shit quality and shit material and they are probably using trackers on their website. This same stunt has been going around smaller animal subs like r/dachsund and r/chinchilla and r/goldenretriever

If you are through a YT playlist/mix, small panel next to on screen volume bar (that appears when you change volume by keyboard) allows you to go back or next video even when you are on fullscreen gaming (tested on some).
---
Sorry but what blizz did?
---
I don't have much to say which hasn't already been said by others. I just want to take the opportunity to saw Thank you. Like a few users above me, I was another geeky high school student who didn't know much about anything and I remember reading (throwing a bitch fit probably) about patches and balance changes all those years ago.
---
Now, I'm in network security and I try to conduct myself like you, Gail, and everyone else as inspirations. Thank you so very much. Thank you.
---
Honestly. I don't like him. I think he's a giant douche.... but dear god the exposure alone from this one guy would be a huge boon to the game.
---
&gt; So I join their team that night and walk through this ranger interrupt built that I though might be good at stopping their Ele (which was what was killing them) and I explained that if we kill the Ele he's the target caller and once he goes down he's yells a lot and will be screaming for a res and this guy is the guy who always resses him first if we interrupt him it's over. 
---
This is some EVE Online level spy shenanigans.
---
Did you see the wording of this "rule"?
---
&gt; "brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image [sic]."
---
It's incredibly ambiguous. *Anything* someone says or does could bring them into public disrepute or offend someone. Someone criticizes Blizzard's game balance on Twitter? Banned. Someone comes out as LGBTQ? Banned. Someone wears an NCSoft hat in public? Banned.
---
There's no way this would be enforceable. A good lawyer / judge would rip it to pieces. The only reason Blizzard could possibly fight it in court is by drawing it out until the defendant can no longer afford a lawyer. Even then, they are likely to settle just to be done with it.
---
can i get free legendary edition for my alt too pls
---
what even is a Legendary edition ?
---
Well since bs usually means bull-shirt, I just wanted to make sure lol
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama or violating the CoC is not allowed.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)

&gt; someone wears an NCSoft hat in public? Banned.

Sure. I don't doubt it. But that's the reality, dude. Whether we like it or not, that's fact. They can enforce their rules, ambiguous or not. 
---
What happens next is in the air. Most likely, nothing will come of this/ The kid is going to get exposure, Blizzard is going to lose pocket change and nothing will be any more different in two days.
---
Honestly I hope he does, because it might mean my little niece and her friends pick up this amazing game
---
&gt;You all have no idea how much this place reads this form, cares about what you say and how you feel, respect that please. This building is insanely empathetic and suffers from the feels in a major way. Not saying stop keep being you just be mindful of your power and wield it responsibility. 
---
If a company's employees get upset over things their customers say that's not on the customers to stop saying things, that's on the employees to change their mindset. If they can't take criticism and they're in a field that deals a lot of that they should change professions.
---
Why is it that game companies try so hard to get the sympathy vote when they're the same as every other company? They're there to profit. Anet is not my friend.
---
Also they have a funny way of showing they care about what we say. Censoring the forums of disagreement to a point where you have to walk on eggshells as to not upset the fee-fees is pathetic. On top of that, being silent on major issues or downplaying massive mistakes makes them absolutely not the victim in my book.
---
Nothing against you personally, just something I noticed in your message that really shouldn't be glossed over.
---
&gt; Mo says "Isaiah why are you leaving unbalanced skills in the game so your friends can win?"

And 5 years later the entire GvG community reiterated the exact same sentiment in regards to [Rawr]...

The implication is that he sits at home watching Japanese porn all day

I recently started using this and now randomly my game locks to 30 fps for 10-15 seconds before going back to 60 fps how do I fix this
---
Jesus you're delusional
---
Some would say that NCSoft are the reason we don’t have Cantha because a Chinese dev didn’t like the mix of Asian culture.
---
Possibly W10's Picture in Picture feature, I think it's in the Game Bar - Win + G.
---
Veterans who pitch fits because they can't destroy the game's economy by using legendary gear on all their characters are fine, worthwhile members of our community and should be listened to without question!

Some could say it, but they'd be wrong.
---
ANet licensed it to another company, who drove their version into the ground. Chinese players who play GW2 mostly do so via VPN and play on our servers.
---
Probably a promo edition that has a lot of goodies and gems, as opposed to what's available to the common man.
---
He was my mentee, I went down to Tacoma one day and we played warhammer 40k, and played games in his PC bong that he was running after that he messaged me asking for advice on how to get into the industry. I gave him this advice
---
1) Move to where games are made
---
2) Get an entry level job I suggest QA
---
3) Suck less
---
He took my advice, we became friends, room mates, and talked game design pretty much every night until he left for Riot, we still get together and chat design from time to time.
---
&gt; It's not like Anet is much different, we don't have Cantha because of China. 
---
That call was made by an NCSoft executive who *left the company before Guild Wars 2 even got out of beta.*  This is *nothing* like that.
---
Quoting myself from another post:
---
&gt;People can say Blizzard is a company all they want -- but there are still shit-stains at the top that make decisions like this for the sake of 100 percent max profits. Those shit-stains probably have families and they live in the same world we do, yet will give into dirty in-humane money. Being a for-profit company is no excuse for this kind of blatant abuse of humanity.
---
I'll put up with some shitty-ness like shitty microtransactions (if I think the game is still worth it), advertising, etc. But giving into 1984-esque censorship is too much.
---
Yeah you all just needed to run better spike my BYOB guild took them down with a ranger spike more then once :P
---
Oh I got some of those stories ;)
---
You know, on a personal level I'm annoyed because I loved Cantha, but I can see koreans' perspective about it too.

of course by comparison they appear better but they both lack integrity, which is what the OP is worried about.

Well okay. I didn't think this was real but this is real. Hmm... Also, really- a Legendary Edition? lol
---
Oh yeah I remeber that vividly as I was one of the people posting that the game didn't work like that and they are just imagining that stuff targets them. (For context players where getting higher priority form monsters and would complain, us Dev's didn't think it was real and it turned out to be true due to shorter player ID numbers and a math random error) 
---
There was also an amazing story about a police box players would bring it up and we through it was a joke until I ran across it and we dug into it and found it some programmer added a 1 in a million spawn chance it would spawn and then it also disabled your screen shot key if you where within site. Pretty amazing.
---
i thought it would at least have a decent release schedule and not abandon most of the game modes, sure they have a shelf life but it should be longer than this. gw2 could have been bigger than wow if anet didn't drop the ball every single time. don't worry, i'm not going to invest in any more mmos, i just come here while i'm waiting for rdr 2, cyberpunk and vtmb 2 to release, once rdr 2 comes out i will probably just be on the rdr 2 sub. 
---
nice, classy.
---
Connection comes in many forms my friend I hope we can meet in person some day.
---
&gt; I don't see people dedicated to WoW long term leaving
---
Seriously. If they haven't quit by now, they never will. ActiBlizz has done so much shit over the years and the players have done nothing but bend over.
---
I played for 6 years and stopped having fun around 4. I quit the same week GW2 came out, for that reason lol

Shhh no one can know

But what I CAN tell you is that we're all looking forward to build templates later this month and that we're committed to bringing you quality content updates without a sub fee.

Obviously we'll have to see, but I would not be surprised if it was the reward for completing the meta-achievement this year. Like the haunted candle was the reward last year. I would have my doubts, but FotFW added that fucking ... goose? backpack. And Dragon Bash had like three different cosmetics that were obtained via achievements.
---
With that said, I'm happy if it's a super rare drop from ToT bags because that means those fuckers are gonna make me a ton of gold this year.

Wasn't it because he didn't want people talking about/speculating/shipping him and other female streamers bc he has a wife ? I mean if he's uncomfortable with it I feel like people should respect that. Shipping in particular can get pretty out of hand sometimes, even with people who are already in a relationship with someone else. It's still pretty weird to me, but if it's uncomfortable for him I can understand that.
---
I for one ship the Charr Salad.
---
As I understand it, it was precisely because of that (though I believe she's a girlfriend?), and because he didn't want the other streamers to be put into uncomfortable positions like that. 
---
He seems like a genuine cool guy. I never have nor ever will watch his content, but what little I've heard from 3rd party exposure is alright.
---
Canach and post Heart of Thorns Rytlock are okay.
---
Nope I bought it of the forfansbyfans site
---
Gw2's twitch reputation is really bad. There was that whole permaban with Krip, who's one of the top streamers now. Then there was that whole thing where streamers were getting banned because people were sending money through real world trading. Finally there's just a general lack of support as evidenced by their deadish partnership program.
---
Okay to clarify I rarely ever post on reddit the whole karma thing puts me off. I don’t post because I’m limited in my posts because of negative Karma.

Certainly not worth the investment. Ninja is the biggest streamer out there but he has no dedication to any title. He just hops to the most popular game he finds to boost viewership and hops again as soon as something new is out. People who srsly wanna find a good MMO just do their research,try out different titles and pick whatever suits them best. He's just fishing around to see what would get him the most viewers.
---
haha that geniunely made me laugh, it's a salute
---
seriously though good luck with everything that you do
---
Let's bet. If he decides to play, they will give him a legendary weapon for free just because he is famous, and they will probably give him a special title so that literally everyone knows that the guy behind the character is Ninja.

certainly a solid choice. There have been times I've used shield too. And shield 4 being a movement is nice.
---
no it doesn't and this argument is ridiculous..you can indeed compensate on a lower dps build with personal skill but there are limits
---
however, you will simply never do competitive damage on some shit like core necro(18k benchmark btw)..no matter how good you are and how perfectly you play!
---
and nobody expects you to do benchmark or close to those numbers in actual fights! pugs aren't that stupid, they just use basic logic and see DH 16k, BS 13k and our core build hero sitting at 7k

and yes people will comment on that in CMs almost instantly, maybe even kick too

Yea that example doesn't work at all. They are not even close to being similar. Your example would work if the **reason** for him not playing with african americans was because of another african american (his gf/wife).

Fandom gets out of hand a lot and can break relationships easily. Imagine being the girlfriend and wake up to his and your feed full of "fanart" of him and another girl for months. Yea.
---
I don't know why you tried to pull this into the category of plain sexism AND racism. Shame on you.
---
The only "scandal" I was there for was when a shit ton of accounts where permabanned due to anets fancy new software, which was bugged, and they did not want to admit they broke EU law in their reactions to it.
---
A big portion of lefties are racists and misogynists. 
---
The fact that you bring up double standards on HK protests and the firing of Anet developers is extremely disgusting. When it comes to women’s oppression, you pretend it does not exist. No matter how hard women have been voicing their frustrations. On this reddit forum, human rights only matter when it comes to political men’s rights. I don’t think you have any basic ability of telling right from wrong. That is also the typical mindset of a leftist.
---
I think the tax exists to curb inflation and stagnation. 15% of all sales basically disappears from the game; this slows the devaluation of in-game drops/wealth. (any loot comes from RNG, while crafting costs are set in stone).

I try to give suggestions (warrior warhorn even got a patch to an idea I put forward, for a little while~), and I lean on what I passively learned on game design to give my complaints some merit.
---
I doubt this game would be hardcore enough for this guy....
---
Bless was a dumpster fire. WoW isn't.
---
If China's treatment of the protests is anything to go by, there will be constant  decisions they make in the coming days that will refresh the news cycle. Also if gamergate is anything to go by, gamers can have festering grudges for a long long time and remain vocal, even entire careers were born from it. But it could just as easily be what you say, and people will unfortunately put it aside in 2 days after considered how much of an inconvenience it is to quit.
---
Loved your last video. I'm usually 100% warrior in everything, so learning a new class and starting out in the deep end has been interesting.
---
That would be disgusting.
---
&gt;Players are now threatening to leave WoW (and other related games) over this.
---
people like to talk. nothing is going to happen.
---
you mean a game that is also owned by tencent
---
Same here, several times i had dreams about troting like i was a wolf or a dog... yeah those were lucid dreams.
---
he did / wanted to get someone banned because he danced in his killcam
---
yes but ninja will just complains and expect anet to ban anyone he doesnt like
---
Yes, the key a symbol of theirs, correct. Though, if you are at the main entrance of the Priory, on the right wall, you will find this particular Priory seal displayed big.
---
when your game has basically no content outside of grinding gold to convert to gems, you start to grasp at every straw
---
I dont know, she looks more like a gorilla to me.
---
Well, remove the sex stuff, the tentacles/crab claws and the "being evil" thing and what you're left with is pretty close to Lyssa. So to create Slaanesh...take Lyssa and add those things.
---
what ?
---
it says theres 76 comments but i counted and were at 25 now
---
but why do you reply that to me ?
---
no clue was meant to be a comment. im on mobile at work sorry bro ill fix it
---
Not sure how to quote from my phone, but I did want to stop you for a second on your estimated rate of progression. First night Nightwell opened up my guild went straight to heroic and cleared up to the last two bosses. Mythic was literally cleared the night it came out by the world's top guild. There isn't really a long progression. You put the shit on farm after the first week and etch out fractional stat gains for the next 3 months.
---
insane value ? 90% of the game breaks down to farm metas for gold.
---
This got nerfed. Youre better off doing map completion. Every map has a chance to drop a key.
---
Finally. Was hoping we finally get it this year. It will probably be a gemstore item but still gonna get it for sure
---
There is nothing that can be done about that. Matchmaking (like the rest of pvp) has never had a full update. Also the amount of people left in pvp is small (compared to past years) and results in plat+ being paired with the same or similar people in almost every game, especially at night. This causes high elo games to either have a long wait for a game or the game just goes "f' it" and pairs them with the first player that joins the q (usually not a plat+). 
---
The +5 -50 is just a dumb trait of this system. Sometimes when you climb higher than usual the game just feels like taking all your points away when you lose and give you nothing when you win. Once again, 0 major updates in pvp, so this hasn't been fixed and probably never will be. 
---
Bots have become more common in the past few seasons, especially this one. Afraid to say anything usually gold and below will have chances of bots. Best thing you can do to avoid them is report the ones you see and block, or get to plat+ where you won't usually see them.
---
Trion already made an attempt at fresh start soon after cash shop update 1.2 because game was bleeding players. It failed. After that they tried again with 3.0 if I remember correctly. It failed.
---
Then why don't you allot the cash you would have paid to a subscription to purchasing some of the cosmetics you want?
---
it was just new servers opening with a limited cashshop for the first weeks. There was never a promise of a true fresh start of the game.
---
Erm... do we really want more players that wine and bitch and threaten to leave when things dont go their way?

If you believe Blizzard silencing protestors is the collapse of integirty, then nothing to report against NCsoft.
---
If you belive Blizzard-Activision putting tons of unethical micro transactions into their MMOs and RTS games is unethical -- also nothing to report on NCSoft.
---
Guild Wars 2 and aNET feels libertating to play after being a wow addict since launch. I can legitimately put down and pick up the game without feeling like I am years behind if I take a few days off.
---
Latency as in ping?
---
the latency is the time a package needs from your Computer to the game servers and back so the longer it takes the higher your latency will be. There is not much you can do about it if it is working as it should.
---
What I mean with that is that when there is no error on the route between you and the game servers and you still have a high latency then the route is just too long for the information to travel that distance quickly. On the other hand, there are times in which certain hubs, routers or servers that route the information to the destination are having issues and it leads to package loss and therefore you have high latency.
---
To check that you need to download WINMTR or PinPlotter and use the /ip chat command in-game and let this software run. If you have package loss at certain instances then you might want to get into contact with your ISP.

However, If you mean performance issues like FPS drops then I can only tell you that you need to reduce your quality settings (especially Player model quality and/or limit) and get used to it. GW2 is not a well-optimized game and mostly focused on a single core. You can make the game prettier through 3rd party tools like the DirectX9 to DirectX12 proxy (which translates DirectX9 calls made by GW2 to DirectX12 calls) and Reshade (which applies shaders to the game)
---
Because I can't justify spending that much money on a game. I like to buy a game and be able to play it when I feel like without paying extra.
---
His exposure is not the kind of exposure this game needs. Whole lotta yikes.
---
A man can dream... :)
---
Yeah defo don't want one of the most popular streamers of all time playing Gw2! That would be terrible!
---
Regardless of your opinion on him, I personally think hes annoying but whatever, Him playing would be good for the game.
---
why are you talking about it like it's some dirty thing? ninja is an extremely high profile streamer that can get thousands of people to buy a game by playing it, no shit anet would reach out to him.
---
then you need to comment on the vid on youtube with "aurene ftw" :)
---
Indeed haha
---
The real question is whether charr horns clip through or just cease to exist while wearing this.
---
Well... I defnitely take our dissapointing LW premiere over breaking basic humans laws.
---
Lmao no one is comming to this piss pool of a game. Their more natural migration will be FFXIV
---
It wasn't really that China was offended, but more like all of East Asia was because Cantha is just a haphazard mishmosh of a bunch of very distinct, and often antagonistic, cultures.
---
Spooky scary skeletons. Just listen the 1 min remix while watching trailer, just perfect. Strart song at 0:13
---
you need a lot more exp for your next level now
---
they should make a "cleansed" version of those weapons were they are just made of metal/proper materials
---
Get ready for them to leave 1 week in
---
I'm not sure what any of this has to do with my post - or the OP who was asking purely about the company's level of integrity, apparently with regards to political stances and related actions.
---
next patch they will buff axe dmg with 2% and call it a day
---
Hmm, it has been 7 years so I guess I don't quite recall it. Especially since I was able to beat the clocktower in year 1. So I died less than most people did back then.
---
The Living World would be perfect for a drunk let's play!
---
I think he is more of a turd sabdwich ;)
---
But honestly I don't think I want him or his fans in my GW2,no matter how numerous they are.
---
I'd rather have fewer more quality players than a bunch of dipshits.
---
I got a free transfer after upgrading my alt from F2P to HoT, but didnt get a free one after buying PoF. Is this intended? Thought i would get a free transfer with every expansion.
---
Movement is 100% done on the server. However, it might appear otherwise because the client doesn't wait for a response from the server to update your position; it should already know where you should be. However, when there's lag, these positions won't line up. So the client will update your position to what server says your position is, causing a rubber-banding effect. In other words, the server's opinion of your position and trumps the client's opinion of your position. If it were the other way around, you'd probably see lots of movement hacks being used in the game, especially in competitive modes.
---
context matters. people don't spread widely internationalised and publicised rumours at any regular wokrplace
---
Honestly, the comments in this thread (Ninja is a douche don't want him/Anet is being desperate for even trying to be engage in PR) are prime examples of the cannibalistic nature of the GW2 Community. It's free fucking publicity, who gives a fuck who it's from. If the game sells money, we get more meaningful content instead of cash shop skins replacing all meaningful rewards.
---
But no fuck this guy for being toxic, we don't need Fortnite fans in our precious game. Honestly fuck off.
---

Well clearly yours isn't either, because I just made a typo and the official forums on the site clearly say it's October 29 instead of October 29th.
---
The "this month" in my joke also gave it away.
---
Ban was for spreading the exploit on stream, not using it.
---
Just once when you upgrade from a f2p account to a paid account
---
im quite new to the game (only 500 hours in) so i dont really know what everything's about recently, but i can tell you care so much about the game u took part in, and that makes me smile. some companies and employees dont give a damn about their game beyond their paycheck, and it kinda makes my heart break ya know? its like your little baby, a creation u were a part of.
---
good luck with whatever you will be doing in the future! you'll certainly be kick some ass!
---
I'm on this driver and have played several hours. Not that I haven't had crashing on other versions with my 5700XT but I'll be watching.
---
Selling an account is like selling a used book. The publisher doesn't typically make money from used book sales. What you're basically asking is for the publisher to facilitate this used book market for nominal profits instead of encouraging people to buy new copies for full profit.
---
not close enough.
---
&gt; If the big shade is so damn important, that's a sign that trait is broken and OP, just saying.
---
if anything, its a clear sign that the class is broken and UP, tbh. 
---
Scourge has 2 traits that reward you for putting all your shades out,  and then a class mechanic that enormously penalize you for putting all your shades out.
---
well thats all fine, but I still dont see any problem with the monetization. gw is a game thats costs 20$ in total for the whole content and at least one more year of free content updates and the only thing you can spend real money is on qol items and skins, so I dont see where the problem is
---
You can check in, but you can never leave. Same with the Dwayna buff.
---
Offtopic question, I really wanna level a new character and the Halloween event is the best to do so, is the Event already up or do I have to wait? Does anyone know if its up or if not when its comming up?  
---
Thanks in advance.
---
&gt; Try to give your boss the same reason, Say you refuse to work with female employees because of your wife and ask him to respect that.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Let us know what he says!
---
you have a job were literally millions of young, social media affine ppl watch you and judge and comment on everything you do? no? thought so.
---
Yes, because everyone who plays any game from the developers stalked women and threatened to make them lose their jobs and murder their families right?
---
Just for your information, assuming every male does/did these things is literally the definition of sexism. Irony is funny isnt it?
---
What she did was wrong, how the community reacted was wrong, but dont shove your agenda down other people their throat and say people have double standards when youre the one with the actual double standards
---
I guess my pet is playing for me too, and my pet was playing when we were doing Istan/leather farm yesterday, and all those people with us their pets were playing too? Seems majority of gw2 playerbase are not actual players, but our cats and dogs? :o 
---
So please enlighten me, how do I make 75g/hour, I would love to know.
---
You must get a lot of exercise from running over to the minimap every time you need to take a look.
---
Maybe captial wise. But comparing some streamer with a company is rather meh.
---
More like fishing around to see if any publisher offers him a huge deal for promoting their game.
---
He won't since they only offered him the core game, which is boring as shit.
---
Make a new account
---
Exactly! It wouldn't be the same as exploring everything for the first time
---
Ye and everybody of those 90% posting "ehhhhhhhhh do we?" has about 0% knowledge about marketing :)
---
I had no idea Morello worked for ArenaNet, thanks for the story.
---
It's a big waste of time imho. Drop chances for good items are a joke, and I've opened plenty of chests with bought keys when they were on sale. The best I got was a black lion ticket which is absolutely terrible value compared to how much keys are worth. I can't imagine farming lvl 10 personal stories over and over again for just 1 key. There's much better ways of spending your time and making progression towards gold/cosmetics than this.
---
If people left a game because of stuff the company does then EA would sell exactly 0 copies of any game.
---
No. World Completion once is enough
---
Likely softlocks him out of being an absolute moron
---
if they had made them blue and transparent with more subtle smoke/mist effects I'd have probably used the axe and longbow for years now  
---
really looking forward to these new ones and I'll probably lose my shit if they also have fire finishers on the skins like the forged weapons or the fiery dragon sword
---
Not gemstore gem. Material storage kind of gem.
---
And who cares that he is not? What will happen is some of his fans will by the game. And some of them will think "damn it will take a long to get to max" and buy boosters. So it will be more money for Anet and hopefully they can funnel that into content for the game.
---
Wait, are you really blaming the milking of GW2 on NCsoft and Anet is just the poor dev in your eyes that has to implement it?
---
unfortunately it can be said to most game titles these days. praise the dollar
---
People will buy skins regardless of their looks, merely because of completionism and collection hunting. To make the most out of your claim ticket I suggest you look at [gw2efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/claim-tickets), but exactly how long your listing will take and how many people will undercut it is at the end of the day a bit of a gamble.
---
Well feel free to share if you're so smart and know the best gold farm in the game by a long shot that can be consistently farmed for hours and hours. 
---
I base my number on this research [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yh487baFzsbJARil-evNdrG3KOmoncEfurElBm0CzdE/edit#gid=1982020967](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yh487baFzsbJARil-evNdrG3KOmoncEfurElBm0CzdE/edit#gid=1982020967) which was done extensively by a person on reddit and corresponds with my personal experience.
---
But you obviously know better, don't you. What's it gonna be? Spirit shards lul?
---
What the fuck
---
Yeah I don't think you're lurking on random subs mate.
---
I wear it like a badge of pride. ^^^No ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^😭
---
And here's where part of your comment is wrong. The game will not start pushing out meaningful content, it'll keep trucking on the gem store items.
---
Done via FB :)
---
Damn thanks man that info was very useful!
---
The megaserver system makes sure that each map has always other players, and they have added new things onto all coremaps along the years. Maps are extremely packed and you will visit after the years of playing.
---
You've got blinded in your own hatred you fool!
---
yeah Fuck Ninja, he sucks...
---
This sounds like a great way to break it down. Thank you for the tips!
---
Be honest, you just try to get the million dollars for solving that problem!
---
This sounds like great advice, thank you!
---
"Obligated" might be not the perfect term for it... However, this may cause the person to test the game, even though they would not have done so normally. This has nothing do to with the worth of such a present but more with the thing itself. E.g. if you own a huge house worth millions and someone gives you another house whose worth is not that high then wouldn't you still look into it at least once?
---
I agree with you, but it's something that has been done way before streamers appeared, so I don't see why condemning it only now.  
---
People were shipping actors and acresses, or singers, or whatever, long before the "advent" of the streamer profession.  
---
Back when I was a kid, people shipped Arnold Schwarzenegger and Brigitte Nielsen because they kissed in Red Sonja.  
---
Heck, I'm pretty sure lots of us have shipped classmates in school.
---
It's just "guesswork" mixed with "personal hope" (a ship always mirrors the shipper's expectations, after all), a work of imagination, and you only feed it if you support it. Just ignore it, and nothing will happen from it.
---
As already said, you nurture those same negative emotions but towards a different topic, which happen to be people that have same emotions towards the game.
---
marketing team != the entire company
---
Because replacing a veteran that has plenty of experience with your product with a newbie that will need months if not years (or ever if he is completely missing parts of the skill set) to gain the same level of productivity doesn't hurt the business at all, right?
---
&gt; he has a multi million dollar contract with Microsoft
---
I keep saying, I chose the wrong path in life...
---
Not inaccurate though.
---
He quit WoW though so maybe he’ll find a balance he likes. I think he didn’t like getting killed in pvp server or something.
---
The only thing i want is pre Nightmare Kessex Hills.
---
Except when some players genuinely like the game and people like you discredit their opinion because "it's an old game, there's no way someone prefers this for a reason other than nostalgia". Some tend to overhype things, but that applies to every game. Just look at some of the dedicated GW2 shills on this sub that will defend absolutely everything about it and try to make an obvious flaw look like a blessing. It's not exclusive to old games.
---
/u/Birkiedoc strikes again.
---
( ◑ω◑☞)☞
---
How come I don't get a legendary edition? :( at least the expansions would be nice ..
---
To me GW2 has always felt like a really cool singleplayer adventure game with some multiplayer options. Exploring all the maps the first time was amazing.
---
that's still sexism, streaming is his work and refusing to share workplace with given gender is discrimination. no excuses.
---
especially since those excuses are really weak - insecure gf/cringy fans
---
was gonna say, i've never heard of a legendary edition. Imma assume its the heroic edition of every expansion in existance.
---
Doesnt take much to hate the game...
---
Legendary collections are a nice way to revisit some old maps. Shame they don't do it anymore.
---
They really should add core map zones currencies and some cool rewards. Some will say that it would move players from profitable, kinda pawyalled living story zones so it will in turn lower interest of new players buying them but on the other hand we will get much more crowd in starting areas, motivating new free players to buy full game
---
PR move 101
---
They're not endgame goals now ? What is endgame goal then ?
---
How many fps do you get?
---
If you expect that you can use this game for political statements, then don't expect that. Games are and should stay politically neutral, and that means even during some events.
---
Activision Tencent Blizzard acted pretty agressively and I don't agree with how they did it, but I also don't agree with using interviews about win in tournament to be used as personal political forums of any side.
---
That was Medium Rare, not the Ballad of Soulkeeper.
---
Sure, but for me it was in 2005.
---
As I said, I agree with you on that.  
---
But it's a harmless type of creepy.  
---
Thinking, or also saying, "I ship John and Mary" is not going to cause harm to anyone.  
---
Making a YouTube video about "Why I ship John and Mary" is also not going to cause harm to anyone.  
---
If anything needs to be done, is to teach people that an unsatisfied shipping is **not** reason for violent reaction, be them verbal or physical.  
---
I've been shipped with this and that girl all my life, because I'm the kind of guy that can be trusted by girls, so girls have always been hugging me, kissing me on the cheeks, and showing strong affection to me.  
---
It hasn't affected my life, if anything it has helped lots of my friends ending up with girlfriends, because I could make soulmates meet.  
---
To come back to the scenario we're discussing here, what can actually happen, according to you, if someone would ship him and whatever female streamer he works with?
---
It's a helicopter crash.
---
GW2 is pay once and free forever.
---
If you buy either expansion, you get the entire game. No monthly fees! The ability to turn in game currency into "gems" (premium currency), is also rather fair.
---
in the EU it is perfectly fine to resell games / digital licences and the EULA can't hold up to the law, so who cares. :D
---
Is that the fortnite guy?
---
When u fail to doge a burst attack, then it is ur fault not anet's.
---
How much gp would that be after opening them?
---
Hey, I started gw1 when I was in elementary school.
---
Young players can still be good!
---
As long as we give em the old gw2 community welcome all would be well.
---
It would be way worse if gw2 had an in game voice chat.
---
oohh thats cute. =)
---
Hugging walls and skipping backside inside missions to get that last .2% lol oh man mapping old days was rough but sort of fun to do some of the tricks like the necrotic transversal ones in the desert to reach more area of the maps.. old days Tyrian exploration was magical in a way
---
I am just wondering how long ANET can keep developing GW2 with it's outdated engine and legacy programming. They have to pull the plug eventually, and the game is, as you said, 7 years old.
---
Any marketing is better than "AAAHHHHHHHHHH".
---
Also atleast theres any marketing at all.
---
(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ FASHION WARS ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Virtue#Dragonhunter
---
As you can see, each of the virtues has a cast time (0.25s, 0.5s, and 0.25s respectively). This inherently makes them not instant-cast skills, and they all have a casting animation. They all lose the inherent benefits of instant-cast skills that I mentioned above.
---
It's more like:
---
If you own a house worth several millions and someone goes "Hey, take this 8 year old caravan FOR FREE. But we printed our company's name on it and expect you to drive it around town everyday to advertise us", would you really do it just because you got it for free?
---
For publicity, why not? If he brings even 1% of his viewers into the game, that is still thousands of new players + ANET would be advertising legendary weapons that way. There is no moral code when it comes to making money in gaming, ANET proved that with their gemstore piggy bank casuals.
---
see and this is why noone has faith in your ex-company
---
Thats the price of the game nothing to do with internal microtransactions.
---
The answer above is the correct one.
---
Mind, if you wanna get super duper endgame (raids only) you'll want condi instead of power. Note that condi weaver has the most complex rotation in the game, and is noticeably less practical in Fractals, Overworld, etc. But yeah, Weaver is great fun. Very glassy. Surprisingly versatile if you bother swapping your traits (see PvP s/d weaver builds, they're tanky). Fresh Air build compensates for Weaver's main weakness, letting you access Water and Earth with minimal commitment.
---
He already played back in 2012 https://twitter.com/Ninja/status/231066807526629376?s=19
---
And before then, these streamers and anyone that plays the content they enjoy were told to GTFO if they dont like the direction of the game or its focus on only story and openworld content.
---
We started years ago with the rhetoric of openworld casuals stating they are the majority and all resources must go to them. Everything else is a slow but inevitable consequence.
---
It may be a compass rose. 
---
The priory are explores, so their tents and banners often feature Tyrian globes and compass roses. 
---
One of the mysteries of GW1 was a series of identical stone compass roses seen mostly in Ascalon and Kryta. 
---
What made them a mystery is that one was found all the way to Cantha, in [Arborstone](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Arborstone_\(explorable_area\)#Trivia), inside a cavern tucked away as if it had been prepared as an entrance. All of them were located in good spots for a waypoint. Not waypoints as in GW2 waypoints, but those seen in games like in Diablo 2 and III, no enemies nearby, near entrances or isolated in a small room, etc. 
---
It could also be some sort of warding symbol, seeing it has circles and arrows.
---
Sometimes I wonder how different the MMO scene would be if GW2 launched in the state it currently is back in 2012, with mounts, end game and much better systems.
---
Not your, and game is already full with those.
---
When Halloween turns up this is always a common farming method to get trick or treat bags in advance to sell for profit, the price always spikes right before the update because new rare drops in them
---
I am still dying to see what the whole set looks like in reaper shroud :/
---
The scribe, somewhere in Lion's Arch. I think just north of the WvW portals. She's a girl now, but used to be symon the scribe.
---
Can confirm Discord is a great way to store builds. I use it a lot myself. I even have categories channel names on what type of damage/support it is doing. Definitely give it a whirl everyone.
---
They say that kinda shit a lot and they never follow up. They don't have a plan at all.
---
Oh yeah misread that. Well, still not worth a comparison, the marketing team of gw2 is on the same level as some hiding janitors: you don't really know they're there except when shit is around
---
Now I'm picturing a particularly large norn woman singing Cher's "If I could turn back time".
---
Just like it's really not the same to forcefully apprehend someone than to be forcefully apprehending someone because they forcefully apprehended someone, it's not the same thing here. And if it is, what's wrong, dishing it but can't take it?
---
Sad to see you going, but I wish you all the best things! :)
---
I'm so sad that I never had the chance to attend one of those ArenaNet community meetings, since I was too young or just couldn't attend. I would've loved to talk to some of you just to get to know you :)
---
Remember when Sodapoppin played for a week and quit because we spammed his mail with thousands of gold and ruined his PvP games. Ruined any fun he would have.
---
It would be really cool if maps that got changed by updates had a "Fractal Rift" somewhere in them, and using it allowed you to visit a shared instance (Mists Rifts) old versions of the map, or at least old versions of sections of the map also in shared instances (like tutorial maps and Hot prologue) if not all of the map was changed.
---
Seriously y'all need to stop seeing people that play Fortnite as bad. They play games and if a bunch of them comes and start playing GW2 and like it, its good marketing. Anet can't just wait for another Bless Online to fail in order to get more new players in.
---
So essentially, even less valuable input than those who complain genuinely about the game.
---
Really got'em there
---
It's the General options tab. Such a feature would be in the Video tab.
---
Damn, I don't have any of that and I've been playing since day one.
---
Yeah. I haven't played it, but watched some people like the lazy peon stream it. Apparently there is going to be a story squish at some point, and I may give it a go after that.
---
You got bamboozled!
---
Oh no, you put me in my place. Oh no...
---
afaik it's done fairly often still. Happens every 2 hours (xx:40 iirc) so keep an eye out on lfg, or open your own if you're lucky enough to own a tag: peeps will come. 
---
It's not as popular now because forge event is much easier/faster and gives a gemstone too, but people are still interested in serpent's because of collections and music box, you'll find groups eventually! Good luck.
---
[AAAHHHHHHHHH most certainly is big enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3Vp1h8lic4)
---
Yes. I want to go back to 2005 and experience GW1 in it's heyday again. It hurts me every time when I log in, open my guild window and see that some people are offline for 8 to 11 years... Especially because I still remember the good old times when we were diving into a new campaign all together and exploring it's wonders.
---
Sword already did slightly more dps than scepter, but it's rotation is sorta clunky. The other thing is that DH didn't need a buff in PvE. It was already BiS for almost every power fight. 
---
Doesn't make sense to buff sword, some cd changes would have been nice though.
---
Microsoft vs Amazon
---
Tysm!
---
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
---
Why would you buff a class which is considered meta and borderline too strong in all three gamemodes? 
---
Exactly, retarded opinions by people upset over the idea of nerfs rather than the reality of balance.
---
He cried like a child because he got ganked in classic wow to much
---
We have endgame now?
---
Not only the hype for the core games release. I was also hyped for HoT and PoF. Something I just don't feel for Living World what is really sad. Now it's more like "Ok the new patch arrived. I can play it in a week or so, no hurry." while with proper expansions I was camping the game, waiting for the little star popping up that the content is live now.
---
I'm sorry. But i find the opinions of incels irrelevant. Good luck cleaning out your mommas depends 🙄
---
What's the tl'dr here?
---
&gt; if the game ran fine such a tool wouldn't be necessary
---
Wrong!
---
First please explain one thing first. The game runs terrible/fine for **who**?!
---
On my Computer I can run the game with max setting and always have 30-60 fps. On my laptop I never come above 30 fps even with lowest settings. So how is the game running for me now, huh?
---
Such a tool is **always** useful, because there are **always** people who do *not* have high end gaming computers. Take any other game, there will always be people who can't get a good performance. 
---
Your argument that the game is running terribly, because this tool exists, is bullshit.
---
&gt; i said microtransactions are getting worse, build templates are a microtransaction, therefore they were included in the point
---
Build templated aren't even released, they didn't even made a price for the slot upgrades. You can't even know if it's worse than anything before, so yes it's a lie per definition. You could call it nonesense, bullshit or baseless allegation too, if you think it's better. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
&gt; keep going, it will only get worse for you as it's easy to spot lies and backtracking in forums where comments are saved lol
---
So you confess that you are stalking me? You're disgusting.
---
Why did you
---
Yes, we do. It would only be beneficial to the game
---
He is married (just answering your question)
---
There's a difference between dumping a game after playing it for quite some time because of personal reasons and dumping the game because someone I look up to said he doesn't enjoy it.
---
What I'm talking about is that Ninja might be saying "Ok, cool game, but I don't like feature x or y" and some of his fans would reduce that to "Ninja thinks the game sucks".
---
Capital H-i-m
---
Next month
---
Weird. My friend and guild lists are packed when expansions release (even when new episodes come out). People come back to GW2 when there are content updates.
---
That man's got a laughter like sunshine
---
Aside from being one of the most popular fortnite streamers
---
oh - a few days ago the page was empty and now there are those adorable little avatars of them! Love it :D Especially that they are shuffled around when you refresh the page. Speaks of team more than hierarchy. I'm really looking forward to whatever they will be cooking up :) 
---
Godspeed!
---
Lina seems like the only borderline trustworthy one.
---
Most of the people playing WoW aren't doing it to raid or run mythic dungeons....
---
Im trying to find a song that plays in Elona The only description I can give is it starts with a harp and is followed by stings. Very mellow, kind of ambient. Anyone have any idea?
---
I'm not an incel and I dont live with my momma.
---
Merely pointed out that blanket buffing top tier specs is retarded. If your insight doesnt go further than "please buff no nerfs" then you dont have informed opinions.
---
If you've never played GW2 before or have been away for a while there is a shit tonne of end game goals and content to work through. Achievements, collections, wardrobe, mini pets, legendaries etc.
---
Just because after seven years a lot of GW2 players have done most of these things (or doesn't even realise they exist - one streamer was talking about how little content was in the last episode of S4 and they hadn't even done the 10 events in each biome achievements), it doesn't mean the content isn't there or that new or returning players won't be engaged by it.
---
the contents of the home instance is identical apart from those depending on some personal story choices and some basic merchants.
---
So any nodes, bl things and the cooking station once unlocked will be in all home instances regardless of race of character
---
And a rift down on the broken drill could let you run the evacuation of LA! 
---
As theyre your typical tyrian mistfuckery they wouldnt even have to be placed where the instance actually starts
---
The cooking station behaves like a story choice then, because I only see it on my Chef.
---
trying too hard there
---
I am a non-westerner, and this kind of apathetic silencing and demanding people not to speak is the very reason why we are here right now. All these negative, oppressive matters finally blow up into one huge mass.
---
It's easy to play the race card and keep scaring people into believing voicing an opinion, even if it is an unpopular one, is equivalent of violence and hate. I welcome Westerner to keep asking the difficult question and not afraid of offending people just because they weren't born here, even if they sounded stupid at the start. 
---
Only by starting dialogues because at least they are trying to pay attention to what is happening right now, instead of acting oblivious to everything that is happening.
---
I agree with you that FFXIV is super stiff and you just go for BiS and do the rotation SE wants you to do (on some classes you can go wild and have some changes in SkS/SpS, what a twist!).
---
I think he meant that you only have one char with all classes on it and can change between them all via the armory in a click. That's pretty unique in MMOs as far as I know.
---
So we exchange refuges these days I guess? We had a lot of Gw2 refuges when WoW Classic launched.
---
There is endgame in gw2?

Ive just passed 450, and the cooking station doesn't have the 'upgraded appearance' (  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Cooking\_Station\_(basic\_oven).jpg](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Cooking_Station_(basic_oven).jpg)  ) as opposed to (  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Cooking\_Station\_(upgraded\_oven).jpg](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Cooking_Station_(upgraded_oven).jpg)  ) . Is this just a cosmetic difference then? Sorry for prob dumb question but I want to be certain, thanks again.
---
...Next.
---
Frankly, no. I'm getting a lot of enjoyment from finding new things in familiar zones, like the Lion King easter egg in Crystal Oasis.
---
And you must be a lovely person...
---
&gt; I dont mean that they should exploit the situation but
---
But why not exploit the situation? Real classy.
---
Also imo, as always in the gaming community, there's a lot of talk, but people will keep playing WoW anyway.
---
No he said a new universe that he can dive in and out of.
---
Not log in, do dailies and then go AFK in.
---
I just dont know why people think its a good idea for companies to get involved in foreign politics.
---
This is so embarrassing XD
---
They can also do map-phasing as seen in S3 maps, in the portions that change when a rift opens. The Karka attacks could replay every 3 hours in pirate LA, and The evacuation and the assault to LA could alternate in the warzone LA map.
---
With the aftermath map, that'll be 3 maps brought back.
---
Is it true that Blizzard has a general "don't do political statements" rule?
---
If you combine it with 3 heads of cauliflower you get a great chance to get a precursor
---
If I can’t find anything in LFG which I usually can’t, I’ll just make my own group on LFG and usually they fill up within 30 mins. Probably a lot of people hoping for a group just too lazy to make their own.
---
Yeah, you are wrong. The hype around this situation won't last a week, because, frankly, no one cares about hongkong. Just like business relations with china, players relations with their games will stay, and people won't just go play gw2 instead of wow in protest.
---
Why do you click your skills?
---
Time for the regular copy paste reply:
---
-Everything is political
---
-Not making a statement is enforcing the status quo, which is also political
---
-Some video games are more political than others, but more often than not your favorite video game provides some sort of political message with regards to how the author or the story is describing some sort of situation which is in itself political
---
Actually I think it is quite the contrary. 
---
It should have been waaaay more... One for every year I played :D
---
Why would you have to turn back time?  It's not like they've made any changes to it in 7 years.
---
If you are leveling and you dont play in 4:3, you're wasting your time...
---
Banning the person, firing the casters, deleting the VOD from the Taiwan Blizzard channel is a political statement.
---
That's what all MMOs are now; MMOs are dead.
---
doesn't seem to be the case given that the rule he had broken was:
---
&gt;Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms.
---
Why
---
"Collapse of integrity"? Yeah, good luck trying to find any "integrity" in an international corporation with the sole goal of appeasing shareholders.   
---
Anet is not better in the slightest, they do even more aggressive political pushes on their social media, like social justice or any other contentious topic in today's twitter feed.
---
Staff DD works in all game modes and is easy just my style
---
What if he starts playing the game and lot of new players come in? Are we gonna show them the insane amount of content anet has been releasing? Or the fantastic plans we have for the future of the game? If the game is fucking dead, there is nothing to do about it, not even Jesus bloody christ could bring it back to life

---
I haven’t played WvW on this PC yet so that will be the true test lol.
---
Once per week. There are easier bosses than VG so they will be easier to pug like Cairn, MO and KC. And Cairn has similar mechanics to VG (teleports, stand in green) however you are not barred from joining another VG instance so you can practice.
---
yes, you can still get shards from already cleared encounters.
---
I felt the same way for a bit and recently did 100% Core Tyria mapping for the Gifts for the umpteenth time. I haven't done it in years, figured I'd give it a go with mounts now. Oh boy. I had a blast. There were a lot of "oh I totally forgot about this heart/dialog/sidebar stuff". It was refreshing with mounts to say the least, traversing those maps that could take forever to clear is no longer such a chore. Forty-three points of interest? Easy peasy. I enjoyed re-experiencing it all....even if it was for the umpteenth time.  
---
But I do not want to see those year one gold to gem and gem to gold conversions.....ever again. Or need to map complete wvw or find that damn Order of Whispers POI that used to be hidden.   
---
There's a lot of nostalgia there. I guess you just have to be in the mood to replay the maps and do more than pop in for a meta event and then leave them map until the next meta. There is a ton of life on these maps still.
---
pretty sure the answer to his question is he can farm VG for magnetite though.

I can't remember having killed same both multiple times in a week before reaching weekly cap, but one of my guildies told me he's is doing W7 twice every week to reach cap since he doesn't have KPs for W56.

Those specs are way better than mine and i get constant 60fps everywhere outside of mistlock and WvW too.

---
This is jokes
---
It's a free murder pass
---
The only exception is when the foreign politics involves China.
---
If China find any association of a product or service with an ideology that they don't agree then it will be banned from the country and that is literally billions of possible buyers that you won't be able to reach anymore.
---
So companies are opening their legs to whatever China demands to reach that juicy market of millions of new rich and middle class eager to consume.
---
Thats the catch, with option 2 you will never know the probability you have to get a Ferrari, you only know that it's superrare. I said 1/100K chance to make both options identical, but in reality you will never know the real probability. Lot's of gambles would be necesary to make up a good estimation, but hey, each lootbox would come enveloped in a shiny paper case with a picture of the super ferrari that you may be able to win.
---
It's already proven that lootboxes with a variety sample of possible prices (including obviously a jackpot price) generates more revenue than placing each of the items in the store for it's right price. There's no need to debate about it. Alternatives to lootboxes are only starting to show up because of the risk of lootboxes being banned. 
---
Think about it. You can get 25 keys for 2100 gems (when they are not discounted), with real money that means 100 keys cost around $100. Each price you can get with each key represents almost zero cost for anet. After all they are just bytes stored on a database that don't cost barely anything and that they would have to pay for anyway. (An empty slot of inventory takes some space on a database. The cost is the same if it contains a permanent bank contract). Anet's (or any company of it's type) only worry is that they have to keep people interested in spending their real money.
---
i dont think Guild Wars 2 needs attention, most people know the game and they simple do not like it because of the casual gameplay. This mmo is simple and you can hop in every few months and have fun, perfect for people who game for fun and not to get perfect at a class.
---
First thought was actually Minish Cap tbh
---
I saw that clip a while back, and it seemed to me he was being sarcastic.
---
&gt; I was just pointing out that your initial post - which proclaimed that we could originally go down Zhaitan's corpse's throat - was speculation. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
And this was relevant to the discussion how? OP asked what this shadow was, I replied with everything that was available to us.
---
Specifying that half of my post was "speculation" was such a pointless and irrelevant layer to the discussion considering there are more signs pointing at the mouth being an entrance than otherwise. 
---
I'll repeat my example, it's as if I used the teaser footage from 2009 to say Anet intended us to be able to swim thanks to that camera movement going underwater showcasing swimming kraits and you jumped in the middle of the discussion to say **well ACTUALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY...** like who cares?
---
&gt; And yet, you were the one who began presenting links.
---
Links to screenshots and images, visual support, comparison between two layouts, not links to dictionary definition. The latter was *your* doing and unnecessarily condescending.
---
Look at the Hearthstone reddit, some people care about hongkong.
---
Wtf who's this fudido? And why the Anet is giving a free copy of LEGENDARY edition to him? Grr
---
Funny enough the first game is similar. Aside from pvp you could solo the entire pve experience.

Assassin-archetypes have been bullshit in MMOs since forever.
---
If you think people are going to mass leave a game they like just for something like this you are very mistaken. They may rage, criticize the company, make threats, whatever, but not leave the game if they enjoy it. At least not in a massive way. Sure, it can make many/most competitive e-sport players to think about moving to a better company, but not the general playerbase.
---
HoT came out three years after launch with little hype and a luke warm reception. There was very little lead up to PoF. No exciting CG trailers or huge marketting push.
---
By the time PoF came out the buzz around GW2 outside of the community was almost non existent, and people forgot about it even faster than they did with HoT.
---
And of course there’s no future expansion in sight.
---
Well, i guess you're right. I would just like to see the issues in Hongkong being portraid more
---

---
Long bow berzerker is a lot of fun.
---
Actually they're revamping it to make it faster to get through before the first expansion, it's still not a free skip but they've said they're cutting out a lot of filler and making 1-50 (the worst parts) faster.
---
I love this community

lore and theme wise - necro since gw1.

To bad they are horrible in gw2
---
I switched it last night - autotargetting with action camera seems like the best of both worlds after a little reading.
---
I really should try this D912pxy think. I'm smack dab in the middle of both your specs (am waiting for the 20series to drop in price a bit) and am playing at 1440p with similar numbers. Steady 60+ in most places, 30 in WvW zergs 3way fights halt to a crawl of 10-20 fps though. I wonder if those WvW numbers can improve on dx12
---
No that's Kormir
---
Exactly that. because on rare occasion us players do know what we're talking about ;)

Yes, I think the idea of a sub would be to move away from cash shop purchase. It’s a shitty trend that the industry has moved into the last 10’years, but it wasn’t always this way.
---
Pretty much every sub MMO has had a history of having a cash shop for a long time now. Besides, a sub forces you to spend so much more than a cash shop and in no way guarantees good content.

I have been playing berserker Guardian and have crafted ascended armor.  I have been working on Twilight as I really like great swords, but now I must adventure into WvW.  So doing some reading it looks like Firebrand is the way to go.  I have also been noticing FB is pretty strong DPS wise as well.  So 2 questions...
---
1)  FB armor is mistral stats for WvW according to what I have been reading.  With the pearl requirements its pretty expensive to craft.  Would I be better off making another set of ascended armor via Fractals?  The cost seems about the same?
---
2)  Is there one good FB spec that I could use in WvW and PvE or are they different based on whether or not I'm healing or dpsing? 
---
Any other thoughts or suggestions apricated.
---
" Blizzard's recent collapse "
---
Recent? 
---
First, Since 2012 there is no longer Blizzard, just Activision-Blizzard. 
---
Second, it took you this long to understand that Blizzard-Activision only wants money, no matter the cost? With all the controversy about Diablo mobile, the monetorization of their games, how they treat their own playerbase?
---
NCSoft is not a angel of a company, but no, we are not on EA/Activision/Bethesda levels of incompetence... yet.

And salvage asc drops from raids.

Oh you utter gem. That's exactly it. Thank you so much &lt;3

That’s sad to hear. I played WoW from BC to the end of Cata, and it wasn’t yet like that.

I guess the point is - it doesn’t have to be this way. It was better before cash shop plague set in.

---
The problem comes from China's goverment. For them, you either do what they say, or you don't get to do any business there. 
---
If any member of The Party contacts Blizzard and tells them to punish the freedom speakers, Blizzard is left with two choices: Cave in to the money, or do what's right. 
---
There was no other choices for them. Silence and ignoring it would not be tolerated by the CCP.
---
&gt;  by pointing out misinformation.
---
What **you** call misinformation, you're by no mean a figure of authority nor knowledge on the matter, just one random redditor. I happen to have a different perspective, we can agree to disagree.
---
&gt; A 2d map from the top down without visible pathing doesn't prove this. Into or under, you cannot tell due to it being 2d of the top layer.
---
A 2d map that evolved and became the final product known as Arah explorable map. A 2d map from which an area was showcased in 3D in a trailer, which allowed us to see the detailed environment and level design around the map.
---
I agree that by itself the map is meaningless, but by comparing it to the final product and observing what was shown to us in 3D, with a bit of common sense and understanding of level design, you get what I'm arguing for.
---
Usually I'd agree that companies should stay out of foreign politics. 
---
But China abuses companies and the countries immense market share to suppress free speech, criticism, religions, states and people - even outside its borders.   
---
They turn companies and artists into a tool of the party dictatorship by controlling their shareholders and companies.
---
 Eh true but it caters to a different audience.
---
One thing I wouldn't mind seeing however is if they were to add more stuff like raids &amp; elite specs to the list of things you can buy.
---
(think of it like buying an expansion but you only pay for the parts you specifically want)
---
The extra income would allow them to produce them faster &amp; it would give people more content to play.
---
It would also fit with how they originally said they would monetize the game (By dungeons being a thing you bought once and could play forever)
---
Berserker spec.
---
when groups underperform in one way or another, it's usually the fragile dps that notice/get hurt by it first
---
from not cc-ing in time to not providing aegis or stability during key moments..or simply having low dps and making the fight longer
---
something like DH can chain f3, heal, focus block to mitigate pressure for a lot of time..meanwhile weaver gets like 2 dodges because anything else is quite a big dps loss
---
they are also disproportionately affected by chill/lack of alacrity due to how attunements work
---
I mean the exact same thing would happen with Ninja in this scenario. It happens with any "big" streamer on any MMO. They don't actually get to play the game, they just get sent stuff constantly and 100's of people constantly chase them around the world trying to get on screen.

---
What Thadd said though I will note that I and allot of the firebrand players I know wish they had gone all the way with tomes and made them full on ranged kits (IE engi like) at the expense of losing weapon swap.
---
The fact they rely on charges &amp; cool downs within cool downs makes them more or less I win buttons when you can access them instead of a well balanced alternate set of skills.
---
No, I don't mean skill splitting. I mean changing the grandmaster trait that's used in PvE Builds, Demonic Lore, to include the old functionality.
---
 Considering they can alter number of targets with a skill, adding this functionality should be possible with the engine.
---
What do I need to do to get ready?
---
A community that accepts new players for the sake of the game's appeal and popularity is less cannibalistic than one that tries to cherry pick who is and isn't allowed to join.
---
And no, I can guarantee you that 90% of his audience has not played or heard of GW2. You severely overestimate this game's outreach. People who have not played MMOs especially have no fucking clue who we are. It is a niche game in a niche market, whose advertisement thus far has been unimpressionable and poorly placed.
---
At the end of the day, Ninja is a huge streamer. This community doesn't seem to understand how huge of a pull figureheads in the streaming community have for putting a game on the map. There are companies that PAY for people who are much smaller than this guy to play their game, and there is a reason for that. Anecdotally, a game I play (Tekken 7) was picked up by a few variety streamers about a year back. That alone got a lot of people I know to FIND OUT about the game, but also to purchase it. Even if 5k people downloaded the game because of this guy, and only 5% of that stayed with the game for any meaningful amount of time, that would be significant. And not only that, but there are plenty of smaller streamers who would copy Ninja and download GW2 to play while Ninja popularizes it (Yes, this happens all the fucking time), further putting GW2 "on the map".
---
Like, this is just a no brainier fucking honestly. We have people like Sindrener streaming and representing our community, I don't see why people wouldn't want someone to help this community grow other than for the sake of some childish notion of an "in club".
---
I guess so. It makes me sad.

---
No its not. Changing numbers =/= Changing how a skill works. 
---
This topic has been brought up many times. Confusion for instance was troublesome for a long time because of this. It either had a high tick damage, or high tick damage on skill activation on all game modes, never in one alone.
---
&gt;I would only see a problem if companies allow pro-chinese propaganda to be distributed through their channels and only ban con-chinese statements. 
---
This is actively happening. 
---
Aside from that I have multiple problems with your statement: 
---
* China's suppression system is mainly based on distraction and subliminal messages.   
---
They dont blare "GLORY TO CHINA" in f.e. your Hollywood movies. They dont need to. But they employ manipulation in other ways, f.e. by adding a chinese character thats magically super intelligent and absolutely approving of the Party, if politics are ever even mentioned. They Show China as the perfect hero, they show China being the perfect home, the perfect state. 
---
* Who doesnt disagree, seems to agree.   
---
This is part of how police states work. Chinese Citizens only know about protester violence in HK, there is nothing the state did wrong.   
---
Tibet, Uigurs and Taiwanese Independence dont exist in their media.   
---
And you better keep your mouth shut about them, too!
---
I'm not saying there isn't a market for it, I'm saying the market for it in GW2 is so tiny that it's not worth Anet's time. Regardless as someone else has pointed out, they would need to change who the accounts are actually owned by (giving them to the players) and this would cause them so much hassle it would outright negate any small profits they would make from legitimising, organising and upholding an account selling marketplace. They already profit from the majority of the need for this kind of stuff with gems&gt;gold.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for account selling and I've sold numerous accounts in Runescape. But in GW2? There's barely anything of value that a 10k hours-played account would have that a new one doesn't have access to. The game is extremely open and convenient and fast to get to x content or to unlock y and the gems&gt;gold just makes that even easier.
---
Does this change actually contradict the NPC scourge lol? What's the dialogue from the NPC?
---
By more PC do you mean not saying the n-word as much
---

You shouldn't criticise peoples play styles. It's F2P and they can play it how they want.
---
by chasing him round, you're fighting on him terms. Bunker down and he will come to you. Fight him on **your** terms. 
---
Either that, or ignore the buggers.
---
That's it, thanks!
---
I think a fix, for all game modes, is to give us a way to destroy all summoned shades. The change makes some sense especially for future balance patches. The fact you can proc barrier cleanse fear and damage around you and a point made scourge a bit to cancerous to fight. He can basically duel with one class while also maintaining pressure on a point in pvp. Similar situation for WvW (can attack a zerg from range while also providing defenses for their allies). 
---
And since they can't change functionalities across game modes, I think the best way to handle things is to simply give us the chance to destroy our shades. This fixes the issue in pve (if boss gets out of your shade, destroy it and replace it if you have any charges left) and for pvp and wvw you would only still be able to apply shade effects in one place.
---
What thing same you, all do mean exact?
---
It’s far from dead. There’s so many people everywhere.
---
I'm a little confused. Your comment doesn't seem to address mine, I think.
---
So no free speach hm?
---
no because charr (and charr players) are disgusting.
---
&gt; I dont mean that they should exploit the situation but a Twitter statement or a special ingame event talking about the misery going on in Hongkong could really help both sides imo.
---
No, it's never good when a company intefere into politics.

Grotesque.
---
I'm late to this, but thanks Izzy. Been playing since 06 and even though i probably /WTF'd at some of your skill balances on guru or GWonline, GW1 was a great game and every balance patch it felt like a whole new game. So many really cool, interesting and quirky skills in the set too. EoE bombing stuff (like Gunther at Fort Aspenwood 😁) never got old.

catering to a portion of your fanbase while disregarding others hardly qualifies as modernization of their marketing strategies.   
---
While I don't really care about them,  gaining exposure from streamers, rarely is a bad thing. However offering promo codes, freebies, beta privileges and the like in order to do so instead of a proper campaign that doesn't alienate other customers is more like a step backwards on any modern marketing book.

Why fight someone who only runs away? He is more like an annoying fly.
---
You don't get the bloodstone version of the oven unless you re-do the collection part for the humans. You don't get the checkbox in-game since you've done the collection once. But it's just a cosmetic difference so no reason to do it again unless you want to get your 10 levels from doing the different parts.
---
I only want 2 things really. 
---
&gt; The only thing i want is pre Nightmare Kessex Hills.
---
u/Biestosaurus_Hax is very right on that point. 
---
And... 
---
Pre-HoT WvW.
---
_Stealth_ downvoted, since nobody is commenting on what is wrong with the suggestion.
---
What players? In WvW? In PvP?
---
well that is what the whole gw2 traits are based of, you decide what you need and what not. If you need a defensive shade you have to use the tripple shade (I use it anyways in pvp)
---
I can't remember the kind redditor who posted their [vector graphics](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qttrcmn3l5zlpsv/AADrcASJikMHd4Lj4wPOUKdEa?dl=0) of the Metal Legion logos, 
---
Got a couple of t-shirts printed, hopefully the gf's one fits her...
---
A drowning man will clutch at a straw.
---
I think the simplest solution is to make make all reveal last longer (so it punishes getting revealed) and make the deadeye elite reduce the duration of revealed, not instantly remove revealed.
---
If he's looking for an MMO to "get lost in", GW2 easily has a couple hundred hours of very high quality content. I can't remember the last time a new player started playing and said "you know what, this isn't fun". All the complaints come from veteran players whose game mode of choice is not receiving the updates/attention that they want.
---
Looks like the [Pyre Gloves](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pyre_Gloves).
---
a drop in the ocean compared the size of the Chinese market ...
---
I think I have an idea which one it is, will respond when I have time to run through collections.
---
well thats how every mmorpg out there works, if you want something you gotta farm for it. the difference in gw2 is, there is nothing necessary to grind for, you only grind for fashion and Qol, also there are at least 10 different ways of effective farming gold, which means if you actually like the game, you have fun while farming and it doesnt feels like grind. but well that depends on yourself. And also you get tons of money just from playing the game, I was just talking about "grind" excessive farming
---
Well know you know who the desperate people are.
---
Epic work as usual, fellas.
---
Which ones do you mean? The burning ones? 
---
That would be [Pyre Gloves](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pyre_Gloves)
---
hopefully we get rich nodes in future raids in fractals as some kind of gambits
---
Me and two other people I know have also received notifications of people trying to log into our accounts just this past week. Haven't played Guild Wars in probably 7 years. I'm thinking there's been a breach
---
i think theres a difference, it feels better to do certain tasks to get a specific item or set of items rather than just grind gold wherever and then swap it to cash shop currency and buy it, at that point it doesn't really feel like a reward compared to say doing a questline and getting a mount or something
---
Oh, yes. I miss the first vistas in Queensdale...
---
Never came across as blood thirst. Always as either desperation or misguided.
---
apparently mike Z has been in charge for the last 2 or so years and things have been getting progressively worse since 2 years ago (PoF) so i don't think the troubles are over
---
this looks like a dude called "Krieger Seele" he is always in DR... just ask him...
---
You keep silent, and you shall be fine. Why the f should you make opinions on something you don't really know when it comes to such FREDOM stuff. If a company which is big enough, say something trying to divide our country, we chinese won't tolerate it, even government doesn't ban it.

 (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ FASHION GEMSTORE WARS ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)
---
...and an idiot will always fail at comprehension.
---
There are no dumb questions ever!:
---
Here is a more comprehensive list of all the things you need, you can click on any of it (like you would on any wikipedia article) and it will further break it down on what you need, how and where to get it!
---
Btw you can also type in-game /wiki followed by whatever you are interested. Example:
---
 /wiki Aurora
---
or you can use the shift click and click on an item, buff or whatever you can click on, and it will appear on the chat. Example
---
first type: /wiki
---
then hover your mouse over the item of interest, and press Shift + left click on it, and voila!
---
Our GW2 subwikipedia is one of the best out there in terms of videogames, with the exemption of WoW, which literally hold the world record for high subwikipedia page. 
---
Hope that helps you, but let me know if you have more questions, we have all been new to something at some point, so pretending that we are better than those that havent yet gone through the experience is kind of douche move :P
---
I'm almost certain the track will change/update when episode 1 comes out.
---
Gem store items are staying relatively constant. They add a new category every once in a while (like glider skins, then mount skins, then chairs) so that can affect the perception that the gem store gets "everything", but in practice, we're getting about the same rate of in-game skins and gemstore skins as we always have.
---
why must you toy with my emotions! :P
---
Eh, ah well
---
Lol... This made my day!
---
Yup the infinity one :)
---
I realize my post was not clear at all : every time I mention the tracks (except at the very end), I'm talking about the one-time EP0 track.
---
Run the trait that gives you your F1 back on kill. 
---
Congratulations, now you can use your damage dealing tome nearly continuously.
---
&gt; But China abuses companies and the countries immense market share to suppress free speech, criticism, religions, states and people - even outside its borders.
---
&gt; They turn companies and artists into a tool of the party dictatorship by controlling their shareholders and companies.
---
This is a load of bollocks. Guildwars 2 was also introduced to the chinese market a couple of years ago and I have yet to see Anet, NCSoft or their shareholders releasing pro-chinese propaganda.
---
&gt; we need more PvP in WvW, not less
---
I'm not sure if I agree with this. Yes we need more fighting, but I think that fighting needs to be done around objectives, not randomly getting ganked out in the open... so the longer reveals will stop that, while giving thieves a better place in zerg fights (through revealed training)
---
Making stealth a partial, untargetable, but visible thing means ground targeted AoE skills are buffed, but single target stuff is useless against it... meaning it's still shitty.
---
To be fair, mining one rich iron ore node will likely get you more rewards than spending 20 minutes fighting a legendary world boss.
---
&gt; or let us interact with it to open it as long as the 4 keys are in place.
---
It already works that way. Just put your four keys onto their pedestals and if the vault door closes because someone else is operating it, just interact with one of the pedestals again to re-open it.
---
&gt; This is actively happening.
---
source please
---
The severity of the punishment doesn't fit the crime is a major reason people are up in arms. I also thing Blizzard just had the poor luck of this happening after a line of other events involving China leading up to this.
---
Well they still don't have more than enough players...
---
or add to friends and whisper or mail them?
---
I'm currently playing condi Mirage with GS and Staff and it's a blast
---
They're just dyed in a brighter and likely more expensive dye. Also they might look slightly different because that character is wearing the [Ember Infusion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ember_Infusion), which is visible underneath the gloves and gives them more texture
---
Don't blame you for abandoning Blizzard but Anet would do the exactly same and more in the same situation. They are just lucky enough to have utterly failed at esports.
---
[This](https://i.imgur.com/XfedO0w.png) is them on my character, dyed Destroyer Orange and Electro Lemon.
---
If you saved Axe 5 for when one of them used pistol #3 at you, the fight would have probably finished pretty early. Don't waste your skills if you can react properly later.
---
Having stroke was a I I thought.
---
There is definitely some interaction with infusions here; I count at least two.
---
But I'd bet my money those are Glacial Gauntlets: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heavy_Glacial_Gauntlets
---
I just imagined them slowly moving  towards the Necro like seekers at Valeguardian.
---
You have to consider the starting point. Like the taxi ad, or using 15 minutes of a hyped reveal presentation to shill your own tacky merchandise. Or screwing up a promotion with a tea shop.
---
s/d thief player here, the idea is pretty bad because stealth is not the problem, but the easy access to it. 
---
Before deadeye, going full stealth meaned sacrificing some offensive capabilities, and while it was still annoying, it was a one-trick build that didn't really stand a chance against any decent player.
---
The current stealth system works well with short duration stealth applications between some attacks, like with s/d thief or the d/p daredevil.
---
The thieves in the video are not deadeyes but honestly they were pretty bad and they could have been easily killed if OP had a little more experience Those builds aren't even mediocre.
---
&gt; Btw, what is this Icebrook Saga track where all tier rewards are replaced with 1 node worth of chili ?
---
I keep running that repeatable track for now, not because i neccessarily need more chillies but for the end reward which only gives 10 chillies for now but will be updated with giving out the new map currencies once the next episode goes live. So when that happens, I already have a headstart of a couple of hundred currency once it releases.
---
Pretty much anything anyone says is going to "offends a portion or group of the public" somewhere.
---
I don't know why this is so funny to me. Bless GW2 players.
---
get a spellbreaker and land a magebane tether on them + use Sight beyond Sight
---
and you are then risking the jobs of all the people employed by that company as well
---
Regarding your first point, you are not locked out until someone else opens it.
---
You can interact once more with any of the four key altars, and there will be an option to open the door again.
---
Well.. i forgot that was a thing.
---
I appreciate the advise, it is a good one. In this case when you can’t see the caster is very difficult to prepare.
---
Also axe#5 has some precast so is even more difficult to anticipate pistol#3 which is almost instant. Most ranger skills have that weird outdated precast which make them very clunky.
---
I don’t think i could have been able to create the opportunity you point out because of the technical limitations of the skills. 
---
I don’t know how could i fight a build like that one.
---
&gt; let us interact with it to open it as long as the 4 keys are in place.
---
Already the case, isn't it?
---
&gt;Fix the bugged loot rate on Visage of the Khan-Ur
---
What is bugged about it?
---
&gt;Change the banner boxes in both competitive reward tracks.
---
Alright, and how would you solve that for all of those people that have already completed the reward tracks? Changing rewards completely for something that can already be done once and has been available for several weeks is not a good idea. 
---
&gt;Make that 500k, or find something better than karma.
---
One thing to keep in mind however is how incredibly easy it is to get it in PvP and WvW. If you have just done dailies and saved up the potions you can basically get it in less than a minute. Making it a massive reward (and yes, half a million karma is massive) isn't a good idea. And same as with the earlier point: Changing one off rewards is usually not a good idea.
---
&gt;More generally, the pvp/wvw tracks were totally designed as if pve, wvw and pvp were 3 entirely separate games
---
Well, they were designed (as is the purpose of reward tracks in the first place) to allow people who prefer to play in one game mode the ability to get rewards for it.
---
One fractal actually has some nodes. Can't fractal remember name, it has dredge tunneling device at beginning.

attempting to smother your system to death by blocking the vents?
---
Basically, reveals destroy DD stealth builds. Spellbreaker has a really good 900 range reveal now that has two charges. Core warrior also has a 1200 range one, but it needs a target. I'll usually run both when dealing with a stealth DD, just to lock them out for good.
---
Watch for shadow steps, and the circle they leave behind when they do them. Once you find it, stand there and watch what they do. They go stealth, it's probably a good time to bomb the circle. Alternatively, someone with a reveal can camp it and hit the reveal when it goes away.
---
Best thing to keep in mind though... These guys aren't trying to fight. They are the same thing as pairs of tank eles and all that other bullshit people do to tap keeps, and distract large groups of people. They are trolling you. It's a build designed not to fight, but to frustrate.
---
Luckily, it's really easy to kill a stealth DD if you can hit them. They have limited sustain, it's all in their stealth. Condi will destroy them, big hits will destroy them, CCs have a good chance at destroying them. It's just fighting them requires a lot of time invested in how thief act when they are stealth. You need to get a feeling on how they are going to move, where they are going to move, and how much stealth they have left. 
---
You have to look for what utilities they have. If they use a shadow step, that means they probably aren't a one shot build. If you see three signet's on their buff bar, they are 100% a one shot build, and won't even have 12k HP. If you see 2 signet's, one with a knife, and one wavy one, they aren't really a one shot build, but they are still built to do some damage, and won't give any tell when their backstab will land. Then you just have to catch what their last utility is (probably shadow step). If it's just the wavy signet and they haven't just hit a backstab on somebody, then they are probably going to have shadow step and an extra stealth. If there's no signet's at all, and they haven't been Condi bombed... Well get condis on them ASAP, cause they won't really be able to deal with it.
---
One shot builds don't have mobility, and don't have much stealth. The in between builds have more mobility, or more stealth, but probably won't one shot you. The no signet builds will have more stealth and mobility, same damage as in between, but no Condi cleanse (unless they run hide in shadows as a heal, which they will probably burn in stealth anyways).
---
Check dodges. If it's a dodge that throws daggers, it's a condi build, but you usually won't see that for these kind of builds. If it's a dash, they will be more mobile, heal and cleanse condis on evades. If it's a slam, they won't need initiative for stealth, but lose mobility and probably won't be able to evade any attacks.
---
Basically, try and bait them to sentries, or find a class that can constantly reveal them. They have no sustain outside of stealth. No heal on steal, and usually burn their heal for stealth. Once revealed, it's basically a S/D thief that can only run away.
---
Like I said, a lot comes down to just feeling the fight when you know how to fight them. Then you'll be able to feel when one is just playing a stealth build cause they can't kill anyone without it, and when one is proper good at kiting people. You'll be able to get a feel for when they are going to pop out of stealth, where they are likely to move, and when they are just running away. 
---
They are killable, but these builds are going to do everything they can to waste your time. However, if you get good at fighting them, you can shame em a couple times, which will usually cause them to go elsewhere or log off for a couple hours. Keep in mind though, the more people they can trap into fighting them, and wasting time trying to kill them, the more it's going to encourage them. You have to fuck em quick to get them to quit.
---
That was just for picture purposes and the Radiator is on the back vent anyways there is a top magnetic mesh filter to stop things from falling inside thanks for the concern though
---
Hot is still popular. Pof is a desert... but people are around too. Not as many as in Hot maps I believe. Season maps it really depends but I saw people even still playing the older ones.
---
Sounds like a fresh nightmare.
---
Doing something differently than others makes it more interesting and challenging?
---
Yes, you should not give advice cause i can see you have a lot of problems.
---
Why would you make a group without checking if a group exists?
---
Molten Facility. Its all mithril though
---
A veteran player friend of mine sent me this - https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Target_Painter
---
Is it a peaceful protest?  When you have protests turning violent... that's sort of a riot, no?
---
Definition:  a violent disturbance of the peace by a crowd.
---
That's the thing though. Letting them stay is 100% an option.
---
What you'll usually see when people want to be big assholes, is pairs of tank eles that are literally unkillable unless the Zerg takes them out. Their entire goal is to kite around like 15 people while doing nothing else but keeping the keep tapped, and everyone from doing other stuff.
---
If you go at them with the "but the keep is tapped! We can't let them stay!" mindset, then congrats, you played yourself. That's their goal. They want you to focus on two little shits, rather than defend SMC, or attack towers, or whatever else you are doing.
---
These people aren't going to accomplish anything. They aren't going to capture towers. They aren't going to break into your keep. They are only going to distract you, and for the thieves, kill people who just can't stop their laser focus on stopping them.
---
Ignore them, and like magic, they fuck off. Their goal is to keep you focused on them, nothing else. If they can't do that... Then there's nothing for them to do.
---
Thank you : ) glad you cared enough about what I did to make you go WTF!! meant you cared &lt;3
---
That's the problem. Nowadays developers ain't too different from politicians. You need to do a good job, but people needs to know you're doing a good job too, else they will start rioting even when there weren't any problems in the first place.
---
Never seen 144p look so good
---
Edits edits everywhere
---
But OP clearly is not. Some of us use keys, some use the mouse. So people are being different.
---
She is Megin Le Fi
---
They even have higher chances for gemstones.
---
Yes. I was there when they tried to shove in Facebook inside Battle.net to sell player data away (real reason why SC2 had no chat channels at release), and I was there when they got caught manipulating D3 loot to boost auction house real money sales too.
---
This is still worse than anything that happened before, period. It's an alarming symptom of very scary things to come, and a good excuse to delete Blizzard from your life altogether.
---
I'm not a very private person ;) 
---
We've always been good friends, I used to room mate with Morello and a bunch of other rowdy crazy room mates. I got tired of craziness, so we room mated up instead, for cheaper rent and non stop games. Turns out we would just work while home way more then we should and our third room mate who didn't work at Anet would force no more work talk. We are still insanely close friends and do lunch and trade off cooking for each other. Z is probably one of the nicest people I've ever meet and he deserves all the goodness the world can throw at him, he cares about everyone and everything so much.
---
This is why I hate getting Proxemics Lab as a guild mission puzzle.
---
Reddit few months ago:  WE ARE GW2 is dying! We need more people!   
---
now: yeah fuck that guy and the possible few hundred peeps the could possibly come from him.   
---
WTF people. This could be the biggest stimulant this game has seen in years. and you don't want extra people into the community for what? because someone is controversial? I mean, that ship left months ago because of someone that shouldn't be said. Take this opportunity. not all are assholes and you don't have to invite them into your guilds.
---
I'm not disparaging the idea of a community, I'm disparaging this community's ideals. My initial comment was meant to be critical of the community's inability to accept certain demographics for fear of tainting the current culture. I say "self-cannibalizing" insofar that this community excels at working against its best interest, not that the community that exists isn't united.
---
Additionally, I do not think the idea of an "in-club" is synonymous with a community. I feel you're misguided in thinking this, if you truly feel this way. You can have an open and welcoming community. You don't have to pick and choose who gets to play your community's game, you can accept people for the sake of the community's growth.
---
You can also trade the Xera Portal Device for 200shards (iirc) if you are lucky enough to get it.
---
You've edited your answer, when I initially read it, the idea was that you wanted a specific pve split.
---
The change is good, but it would affect heal builds in PvE since they use the big shade to easily reach the group. And as I said in my post on this thread, the fact scourge and proc affects around him and around a node makes it hard to balance in pvp, so the current functionality is certainly the right way to go about it. I think allowing the scourge to destroy the active shades is a much cleaner solution, that would work in all game modes without affecting any of the existing builds.
---
The first half is basically Cliffside fractal.
---
I'll add that I think MMOs have always had a few too many competing concepts trying to live together at one time.  
---
Let's start with some of the earliest designs that I recall where things such as player killing was just part of the experience:  
---
- Competition among players ultimately results in players cooperating in larger numbers to better compete (Just like IRL)  
---
- There is a market of potential players who prefer the cooperative side separate from the competitive (Just like IRL)  
---
- There is a market of potential players who want competition separate from the cooperative side of the game (Again like IRL)  
---
- Then there is a market for people who want to spend some time in the world but not necessarily actuall have to make friends etc.  
---
And so much more too... 
---
- You're already going to be creating a huge world to try and house all these people.   You're eventually going to be forced to invent a reason for them to be running around (to keep them playing)  
---
- Part of their reason will be progression, you need methods for that, means, and likely some trade system.  
---
Etc.  
---
To make a rich MMO you're really trying to rebuild as much of the real world as you can while trying to keep it from being too contrived or overly complex because people are ultimately in your world in their free time unlike IRL where we're kinda forced into it.  
---
Now consider what a single player RPG DOESN'T need compared to an MMO:  
---
You don't need to put any thought into competitive play of any kind.  
---
You don't need to think too hard about game balance.  
---
You don't need things like RNG loot, grinding or other methods of keeping people coming back while you make more story for them.  
---
You don't need crafting or trade systems, which includes farming, gathering, gold sinks etc.  
---
You don't necessarily need a persistant world, or a particularly dynamic one because the whole thing is being experienced from a single view at any given time.  
---
While you still need a reason for the world and the player to be there, but you're also probably assuming that the game (Or at least character building/progression) ends, or halts when your story does.  
---
That list us somewhat shorter in games like GW1 or Diablo 1 &amp; 2's LAN/Battle.net modes, the salient point being the devs have a shocking lot less to have to keep developing and monitoring.  
---
MMOs are a thing that look super great on paper, but to really do them right means a truely Herculean effort by more people than most studios can manage, or more time than most publishers are willing to give to any game.  
---
**TLDR:** More than just too many characters, there are frequently too many pieces that need to be updated, expanded and balanced to keep things running smoothly, which is why I believe simpler games like GW1 are remembered more fondly by those who played them... The more limited scope of game play kept a lot of mud out of the waters in both characters and story, as well as systems.
---
The protests are absolutely being opposed with violent action by the government, yes.
---
But to describe the protests themselves as 'violent' when hundreds of thousands of people are marching in the street with a marked lack of violence as a result of *their* direct action, is incorrect and misleading.
---
What's your power scrapper build?
---
Ideally, there would be more nodes available after events and bosses, at the expense of nodes becoming account-wide. 
---
But still allowing you to get bonuses for the number of character slots in the account to compensate, it'll suck paying for character slots just to gather more only to lose that.    
---
And also making it so each map accumulates a bonus for its nodes daily as you login, so you'd get more materials per swing when visiting maps you haven't visited for a while. 
---
So you'd get more overall materials by doing many different events and exploring more maps than the material you get now by spamming F daily at a rich node near a waypoint over and over like a bot, and have more fun in the pricess, and you would not have to park any characters anywhere if you don't have to, but still get the benefit from having more characters.
---
Such a gathering revamp could include masteries so free accounts can't be used to farm materials with bots, making materials gathered by players more valuable and cutting part of the income for RMTs.  
---
For example, a mastery could unlock the ability to gather from boss corpses. Defeat the Claw of Jormag, you get to mine the corpse to get some corrupted cores, and a chance to get lodestones too.
---
Thanks for the information.  I didn't realize there were different versions of the FB.  I have only ever played as DPS dragon hunter.  For WvW is it better to go one way or the other?  I like the idea of switching over instead of having to craft the full exotic set to eventually craft ascended.
---
Ah I could farm VB for the airship parts.  I didn't realize the vendor sold them.  Thanks for this option.
---
Don't use this as a reason to use condi in pugs
---
What power scrapper build do you recommend for PVE?
---
They are Pyre Gloves with a bright dye. Probably Orange or Yellow hues, and most definitely from the Exclusive Dyes set.
---
Make sense. Being famous comes with baggage. If you don't mellow out a bit you get people like Jake Paul. But then again, people and kids eat that shit up like chocolate.
---
Same reason you did.
---
Nice analogy lol
---
Haven't people been saying that since "half expansion"?
---
I've never played GW2 before. And I'm wondering if i should delve into this game. Any inputs?
---
Seriously? You're going to defend the class that has been dominate for the last 2 years and is in literally *every* PvP match?
---
I don't use this phrase often, but Scourge (and Mirage) is the definition of GW2 cancer. Combining a Scourge with something heavily-supportive like a Firebrand or a Tempest just makes them totally unable to be dealt with. 
---
I'm beyond tired of those situations where I have to give up a node because they're a Firebrand+Scourge combo and we're not. I'm fucking sick of all my burst damage being totally negated by ridiculous amounts of barrier. Why even have boons in your build when they're just going to be corrupted anyway? (That's a problem with Necro in general). You might as well just not even bother. Why is Scourge, a spec that was advertised as being very support-oriented, allowed to be **the** huge damage dealer? 
---
Scourge has been one of *the* biggest plagues upon this game, and I have no sympathy for them, even after these huge nerfs.
---
&gt; they stripped him of his earned rewards. 
---
Because that's actually a part of the rules that he agreed to abide by. Break it, you lose your earnings down to 0%. 
---
Also, there was a more recent Olympics "scandal" where to black medal winners did the Black Power sign and both got their medals taken. 
---
Politics just doesn't belong in sports/gaming.
---
We already have dipshits. Far too many.
---
&gt; Where do I go to find builds and rotations for quickbrand. 
---
The most up to date builds are on Metabattle. Sorry, but I can't give you the link due to being unable to get to the site at the moment. A google search of 'metabattle quickbrand' should take you right to it.
---
I'd say selling themselves out to a culture that exists under an oppressive regime, ruining the livelihood of one player and two casters, is very scummy for sure, and certainly a worrying sign of the future of the company.
---
But I would say destroying the livelihood of roughly 800 people who passionately worked for the company for a range of years at the same time as spending the equivalent of all their salaries combined for multiple years to hire a new CFO as they post record earnings is worse.
---
But I guess it doesn't matter either way - you, and I, and anyone that has seen what Blizzard has become can probably all agree that they are not a company to support. They aren't what they used to be. They're just a corporate shell around what used to be a consumer friendly respected company made of gamers and artists.
---
You need to check your math there pal.
---
Sure, it's fine when you ship fake people. Especially when they're underaged 'cause let's face it, everyone shipped Ash Ketchum and Serena. That's fine. Let's all root so the 10 year old gets laid but god forbid we ship Ninja and PewDiePie because they're real people.
---
Definitely had a key-stroke
---
Well, at least one third of your name is accurate.
---
Yikes...
---
Don't do that unless you get a 2nd one though. You'll get plenty of shards later.
---
We both were playing Mirage, too, so there were eight of us running around at the same time. Spooky!
---
I think you need to go back and reassess your original response and then have a good long think about what you have just typed ;)
---
 I followed "This is the strongest MMORPG on the market now" type opinions when deciding to try this.  What i quickly realized is that my aesthetic and game-play tastes are above and beyond the developers of this game.  GW2 is a compilation of 3D assets, lore, and game-play templates downloaded from some big legal dump that all Korean mmorpgs share. These here fools even made a blindfold wearing class...  The game's a soup. It was not created, it was compiled from a lot of existing DNA, nothing authentic about it, not currently, previously or evar.  It's world is like a shopping mall full of dressed up cos players you don't recognize/give a shit about.
---
I found my new MMORPG, it's called WoW Private Server... It's a better and unique take on the whole D&amp;D fantasy theme since it's RTS days, and it's free cause it's a private server.

As they have said in GuildChat, Metal Legion took them a great amount of work (the greater part of a year), and they can't realistically afford to keep investing so much effort into a side-gag like this. Even though they agree that it would be awesome to have more songs and different bands in the game. 
---
We'll have to keep enjoying Metal Legion's performance in Grothmar, because that's all that we're getting anytime soon.

ANet avoided implementing Canthan elements, allegedly to avoid getting banned there. 
---
However, I nowhere mentioned GW2, specifically because its a bad example. If you actually want obious ones look up documentaries or video essays on the topic.   
---
Just a few days back the new Top Gun movie was announced to avoid using Taiwanese and Japanese flags; and Red Dawn - a movie about a Chinese Invasion in the US, had its villain changed to North Korean. These are just minor examples in a single Industrie, both part of a huge shift.
---
Since you’re account sharing Anet will more than likely shut the account entirely.
---
Try making a new account
---
Woot!  Can't wait!  :D

This made me laugh and it was nice
---
I actually have a lot of fun still going through and completing maps, just exploring around and finding new things. Problem is, I'm easily distracted when everyone else has the shinies and I don't :(
---
The good news is, however, I found out a friend of mine recently started playing for the first time, and helping him out has been very fun, sort of giving me a new direction in the game. I might become someone who just takes newbies around and teaches them about things. It would give me a good reason to level my Mesmer that I always forgot about.
---
Meh, guards need a good aoe spec, it's not OP for DPS, it's only really powerful in PvE, and it gives guards something back to replace the lootstick nerf. It's fine.
---
That doesn't answer why more people would shy away from the game than come to the game from a statement.
---
Hope not, Anet has presented poorly before by pissing on other developers.
---
woop woop!
---
No where on there does it say you will get banned. Transfer of rights, obligations or liabilities is not "sharing". That's just you cannot sell your account, which in of itself is the bannable offense. 
---
If they would ban everyone for giving away/sharing their account every time, there would be a lot of current players who would lose their accounts.
---
&gt;Yes, and if they lose more than they gain it is a net loss, and thus they don't really gain anything from it.
---
It's just literally not what you said, but I digress.
---
&gt;Because reality? Every single time a company makes a direct statement related to another company or a political issue it creates a shitton of rage from groups of people. 
---
I think a company standing up for human rights and democracy would not upset more people than it would please or attract.
---
It probably would not be regarded favourably within the industry and Anet have been criticised before for kicking other developers when they're down.
---
For once I agree with Lord Krall having a sale would be quietly the best thing they could do.
---
Wait there arent any butterfly or giant swords being thrown around ..... Yet
---
All the previous bullshit was just your usual deplorable corporate overlord shenanigans, the difference this time is they went head-on into politics; and not just your usual left/right crap, they went right against human rights by siding with pretty much the worst government of the present, currently accused of genocide, organ trafficking, slavery, and many other things.
---
It's no longer predatory gambling social manipulation, they don't even care about your basic human rights. That's how bad it is, and I hope they suffer as an example for anyone else willing to bow down as well.
---
Ha!  I always wp in to get nodes before guild portal is used by others to go there.  The pull is strong - must mine ore.
---
They aren't bragging they're saying how the current system is shit and creates shit matches where often one side just takes over everything due to population imbalances in different timezones and we still have no idea when or if alliances are coming which a lot of people hope will solve the population discrepancies during off hours even if just a bit.
---
It really does. If someone who supports mainland China sees that A-net supports Hong Kong then, well, why would they want to play a game that goes against their believes? 
---
See?
---
Also, who the fuck cares? I don't play a game because a company made a political statement just to be politically correct or to appease a crowd.
---
Have fun instead.
---
That's dumb, you have to wait for the slow ones anyway. Well, at least they no longer wipe, since we have gliding and mounts.

Use east asian political chaos to make profit while being watched by NCSoft. Yeah, what could go wrong?

You really have not got it yet. Alliances wont fix that issue at all. It will work like now were you can move from world to world and you might decide who is in your alliance but people outside of guilds will be randomly placed on worlds so it will be exactly the same just worlds instead of servers.

It is literally in the User Agreement. The whole point of it is to have rules to abide by and get punished if you don't.

&gt;You may not make any assignment or transfer of rights, obligations or liabilities related to this agreement and any attempt by You to do so is null and void.
---
if you are going to talk about a line maybe you should talk about the WHOLE line? Not skip the part that doesn't support your argument? "Assignment" is very much something that can be read as sharing. '

Perma-stab flamethrower engi (or holo/scapper) with rocket boots and rifle turret as utility skills - static discharge, streamlined kits and gadgeteer as traits. One of the funniest to play in generic content, farming, dungeons and WvW shenanigans.

Yes.
---
People complaining about some public figure being hosted by a company are an immensely different thing than said company outright banning said speaker and confiscating his unpaid earnings. 
---
If you really need an undeniable example look up the Liu Yifei Scandal and #boycottmulan .   
---
You also completely ignored my second point: 
---
***Who stay silent, seems to agree.***   
---
Thats how it works in NK. Thats how it worked in the Soviet Union and thats how it worked in Nazi Germany.
---
Well, even though sharing accounts is not allowed that's probably not the reason for the banning but rather the broad list of places you connected from and then those failures at trying to purchase gems. Their automated system probably flagged it as a stolen account or something along those lines and got the account banned as a preemptive measure. Contact support and provide all the info they ask you to prove you are the rightful owner of the account and you will probably get it back.
---
That's quite a stretch and not at all what I said. I can't say what I am saying more clearly, so I'm sorry that you are not getting it, but I think we may as well cut this conversation here. Have fun in Tyria.

I agree, I was just responding to the question of how saving or linking them would work.
---
But.. you keep claiming that making a statement about Blizzard banning people is literally the same thing as making a statement about the situation in Hongkong... 
---
Saying: "We do not believe in banning people for talking about political issues" would be a direct hit at Blizzard, but it would not in any way or form say anything about Hongkong.
---
most probably not only Blizzard but every game company has in their TOS (in some way or another) diverse dispositions to protect themselves against actions that damage the company's reputation or something similar. A different matter is that they choose to enforce those those directives when something along those lines happens. In an event with so much public they should have probably just given a press release stating that Blizzard is not responsible of the opinions of their players and bla bla bla, and then "silently" warn the guy to please refrain to make these kind of comments in the future. The way they acted just got themselves an Streisand effect.
---
&gt; Who stay silent, seems to agree.
---
Or they just dont care about it.
---
I dont see a good reason to expect a company as an entity to have political opinions on any dispute that happens somewhere.
---
Sure, some businesses definately do have political opinions (or financially support political parties) and thats also fine by me. 
---
But why would I boycott a game for not formulating an opinion about issues that concern me but not them?
---
Until now, all those blizzard customers throwing a fit didnt have a problem supporting a company that probably generates a huge amount of tax and other revenue for the chinese state.

Yes, that's the page and link I tried.. It keeps saying ***"There was an unspecified error. Please try again."*** I'm sure I haven't used the email, I even used other emails to be 100% sure and it still doesn't work. I also tried on another computer..
---
I know you said you tried another computer but have you tried another browser and turning off any ad blockers you may have?
---
Yep tried that too, lol. You can try for yourself, and see if it works for you?
---
All I know is that it won't be such a pain in the ass to play with guild members that happened to have selected a different world before joining and being blocked by a paywall to move.  That in itself is a step in the right direction.  People won't be randomly placed in world's when they join a guild they want to play with.
---
&gt; That's bullshit, while sharing accounts isn't recommended they can't won't ban you for this.
---
&gt; I have personally stated on a few tickets that I shared my account with my brother. Hell, we still do sometimes. They will not ban you for that. They simply will not offer support should your sharing result in a loss of characters or items. Simple as that.
---
They do ban accounts who are shared, which doesnt mean that all accounts who are shared will be banned. Its mostly when they have been sold for real money or if an ownership dispute arises which cant be resolved (as both or more parties have access to all required personalized information). Or if their security measures that are put in place in order to counter payment fraud are activated by payments from different cards/locations.
---
I think they also are fine with accounts being shared by family members **in the same household**.
---
Also keep in mind that whatever CS agent was reading your ticket most likely only deals with certain aspects of the game (payment issues, item issues, bug issues etc.) and most likely isnt even able to ban you.
---
Actually I did. I have almost 6,000 achieve points and was very active in PVE. Did lots of fractals and had ascended trinkets with 100 AR! :) also put countless hours into making my guardian look amazing! I’ve had him since launch.. really hurts to lose it all like this
---
You *have* to spam the shades in pve, you lose a lot of condi duration otherwise. If you save them for the target moving you've just lost a lot of your dps, so either choice you make ends in a loss when the target is moving. But at least if you're refreshing your shade placements you can hope you won't have to move while if you save your shades you're just accepting that dps loss to begin with.
---
Do map completion in first person.
---
any silicone or pouring medium/water?
---
The submission thing does say to make sure your boots are visible, but the login screen can obscure it so just be sure when you’re taking the screen, I guess if you want to do it from the character select? You just upload three screenshots (unedited, uncropped, no reShade or anything) and submit a title, with your account name and character name, and you can submit a small blurb about it if you want.
---
No, that's not the point. Condi does not work on Adina because with a group of 10 people, phases can be short enough for condi DPS to not have any time at all to ramp up. Even the most bursty condi builds out there won't even compare to the burst of 6-7 dragonhunters unloading a good rotation.
---
Don't run condi on Adina.
---
&gt; Anyway a few days ago I fired up GW2 and started playing, and also tried to make some purchases on the Gem store. I tried with 3 different cards and it did not work.  
---
That's most likely the cause, right here.
---
You should have stopped at the first card.
---
Explanation:
---
Most game companies are really sensitive to payment information.
---
Under normal conditions, you would think that just a biased system, but historically it has reasons.  
---
Around a decade ago it was a common scam trick to purchase ingame stuff and force a chargeback from the card company. Due to the specific way that ingame credits work (you are purchasing a coin to be used to purchase something ingame) it was really hard for companies to cope with it. Games didn't have any sort of system to track this kind of stuff and companys would waste hours and hours of GM time to check logs and roll back stuff.
---
Stuff was complicated, I remember people from my class, literally teenagers here, doing it all the time. If you get banned create another account, repeat.
---
Until it reaches a point that if you try to purchase ANYTHING from a game company nowadays, and the card does a chargeback (for any reason, including the bank or card company trolling you) you get an instant ban, many times without any chance of recovery.
---
If you wanna recover your account, get ready for a veeeery long sit with ANET tickets. Since this involves the GM AND the payment department. This is a big and annoying mess.
---
Same at t2 EU right now.
---
nice joke, but did new players with free accounts cannot whisps or something changed? just curious
---
What I suspect is that some code that checks your location is not being executed properly because some of the data is not loaded yet. (this happens after loading a new map/waypoint)
---
Probably somewhere a line is being executed too late after the player allready gained control and only to be executed again when you dismount, meaning at that point your location differs from what the server thinks you're on, putting you back to the spawn.  
---
Some weird behaviour  can also be seen when you mount up and fly towards the edge of the map where it says 'go back or you will be killed'. You will always end up where you mounted up. So if you would mount up somewhere on the east side of the map, and go to the west side of the map and go out of bounds (dying) you will respawn on the east side of the map.
---
 But then again, this is just a guess.
---
For you, I found an easy one, you just need to run to the corner, nothing more: https://prnt.sc/ph5ole
---
&gt; Or if their security measures that are put in place in order to counter payment fraud are activated by payments from different cards/locations.
---
you failed to quote the part of my commen that was relevant to this specific situation
---
Woops. Missed that part. Yeah, he fucked. But, ok. How would anyone then pay for gems if they move to another location or start using a different card? Like seriously, now. It's very counterproductive. I've used PayPal only and from my home country but what if I then used my girlfriend's debit card while I was in Colombia? Banned? How does that make any sense? And I actually used a PayPal at one point that wasn't even under my own name. 
---
May as well as never buy gems then (shrug) or risk getting banned.
---
Or at least get a cooldlwn reduction based on hlw much euration your shwdes had left
---
If you want to build for GW, plan around the CPU since GW performance is mostly dependent on single core CPU performance.
---
\*iirc\*
---
You're right, for me it's the (vertical) progression that has been so engaging.  Meanwhile in GW2 I haven't had to upgrade armor in 6 years which isn't inherently bad, but I've got nothing to work towards and immerse myself again.  There are only so many legendary skins to collect.  My most recent 'goal' was to collect a stack of dungeoneering chests.
---
I, a PvE plauer, was fucked by PvP/WvW changes with this.
---
&gt; can I still enjoy the grindy aspects of the game if i fully focus on mesmer?
---
Sure. Very little farming require a you to so anything but pay attention and be a warm body.
---
&gt; Also asking his relevancy overall, from fractals to something more competitive PVE wise.
---
Mesmer is a top pick in Everything, and can fulfill every role except Raid Healing. Historically it's been *too* good, though these days that's downgraded to merely very good.
---
This is turning into the whole "power only at sloth" stupidity where they all got outdpsed by the condi banner warrior for months. What you say is only true if you have 10 people all doing what they are supposed to do almost perfectly.
---
Can you tell me how many times in a pug you saw ppl pulling dps enough to push 1st phase within 30s? cause that is what you need to do for this argument to be true.
---
Condi is perfectly fine and a perfect firebrand for example will always outdps a perfect DH unless there are at least 4 other DHs that are close to perfect and support is on-par with boon uptime.
---
&gt;Don't run condi on Adina.
---
Is really like saying don't run a 2nd healer in a lot of the bosses. Sadly, doesn't work as advertised with pugs in 99% of the cases.
---
That sounds like a nice friendship, sadly not a normal thing these days. I'm also sorry since I probably said not so nice things here on Reddit in the past about ArenaNet, but you quicky lose touch that behind the scenes it's just humans doing their best at work when you're passionate about things..
---
Thanks for being so open about these stories, it's always great to read about other people's lives.
---
Also I'll keep an eye what you and the others are doing at the new company, the team seems promising ;) best wishes
---
Anet really screwed the pooch on this one.

Sad but true. Governments seem to be at a complete loss when it comes to tech. At least the EU is trying though, unlike here in the US where only the size of your wallet matters. That and when it comes to tech US gov is at a complete loss.

Ahhhhh, Hype!

It is funny i get downvoted when i just repeate the info we been given by the devs.
---
Lies
---
Not everyone knows about the gimmick tactics used to cheese dungeon paths. 
---
Do not forget this game keeps getting new players all the time and dungeons are core content.
---
Let us not forget that Anet literally has P2W China servers where you can outright buy legendaries on the gemstone etc. 
---
The amount of revenue from them is probably pretty significant
---
exposed what? you literally just lied and made up shit in your post and then called me a troll when you are the one lying and making up bullshit.. when i call you out on it you just say i'm trolling again, this would be funny if it wasn't sad.
---
Imagine telling the person that makes the scourge benchmark on SC for raids in GW2 that they are playing scourge wrong in PvE.
---
That trait has an ICD of 3 seconds and can only apply it's one stack of burn once per target every time that ICD is up. 
---
That trait maybe represents 1k burning damage/ sec net per target and if anything the bonus torment damage it gives is more impactful. What you may be mistaking it for is Dhuumfire in the Soulreaping line which gives a stack of burn on f abilities with a 1/2 of a second ICD. 
---
 If the issue with PvP scourge was Demonic Lore that ICD should and could be split to reduce it's contribution but that's not you're problem truely. 
---
The scourges old functionality is not what made scourge op in PvP, Necros always been "OP" due to condi's and corrupts synergizing so well in a game mode where everyone wants to stack tons of boons on themselves.
---
Guildwars movie?
---
You are not making the phases slower... The only way for it to be the case if your supposed power class is doing far more dmg that your condi one. Otherwise it doesn't matter if you are playing power or condi and pulling the same numbers. Nothing really changes.
---
Holy Mother..
---
Finally the trees are taking revenge on the [swinging boys](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a2dbxj/locations_of_all_the_swinging_boys/) making fun on them all over the place.
---
Ah I didn't read it. It's exact same on T1 EU then.
---
I just select specs that buff the skills I like. In exemple, there is often a spec with improvements to cooldown on a particular weapon, I'll take the one of the weapons I like. The third and last slot is used for the elite spec (at 80) so it's often used for that. You really have to try it all and see what you like.
---
How is it a gimmick tactic to use stealth and stay stealthed? Also how is it a gimmick tactic to open map and waypoint? Those are the two examples I used, didn't say anything about gimmick tactics.
---
Also core dungeons are far better than fotm/raids are anyways in terms of assholery. I don't do fotm anymore, but I still have 101 of the kp for cm100 from over a year ago and can safely say that it was probably the easiest place to go to and find people trashtalking and ragequitting in all of PvE.
---
That makes a lot of sense, actually -- the focusing on one aspect *for* group play. Kind of wondering how I didn't put that together lol.   
---
When they make a build, are they typically making it with other classes in mind? Or do they just look at what the class they're building for can do and pump up one aspect of it that *would* work for a group?  
---
For instance, if I look at a Mesmer, and note that they have stuff around condition, power, and general utility (though it seems to be very buff-y), would a build I find be presuming certain other classes, or do they simply suggest a build that works well on its own merits?
---
We don't know they were benign. All we know is that they were using memory editing software while running GW2. I don't feel like faulting Anet for not liking that, and people should really know better than that, no matter if you were actually using it to cheat in GW2 or not.
---
How does sanctuary cc? Thought it prevents people from entering or leaving?
---
This is amazing
---
I said that you shouldn't spam the shades **in the same place.** Yeah, you get a bit more boon duration and condition duration for every shade you have, but that shouldn't stop you from spread out your shades to confirm their damage. What would you rather? 3% more condition duration, or actually being able to hit your target with your shade damage? People are way too damn tunnel-visioned on maxing their DPS over something at small as 3-6% increased condi damage, that they will complain on Reddit saying that the class is unplayable because they're playing so braindead that they aren't using their profession mechanic the effectively. 
---
&gt;It's akin to saying berserker f1 with longbow should be spread evenly just in case the boss walks out of it. See how dumb that sounds?
---
Why would you compare these two things? Scorched Earth is a pulsing fire field that stacks on top of itself. Scourge Shades are, by design, meant to spread out over a large area because they **don't** stack.
---
